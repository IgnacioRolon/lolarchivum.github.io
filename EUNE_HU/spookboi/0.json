For example you get 2 ,disenchant them and couldnt get more on said Champion for a set period (Kinda like Chests)\r\n\r\nYeaaah, thats it \r\nThanks for whoever read my little rant.","replies":[{"poster":"Jack Eron","date":"2020-02-22T14:01:41.569+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Már a sokadik ilyen ember vagy.
