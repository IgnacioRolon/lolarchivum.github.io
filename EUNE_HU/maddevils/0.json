It&#039;s not enough that you make the game worst playing with every singe patch, now even the game or the server is the same S#%T. With working network keeps disconnecting me every game till i couldn&#039;t even log in. Had a little time to play and i wasted my time trying to reconnect and lose every single game because i was too behind and sometimes this happened to my teammates too so they were in the same spot like me. CRAP! I&#039;m really upset. I hope I&#039;ll get even the leave buster penalization for this, because last game couldn&#039;t reconnect anymore after **3 MINUTES PLAYING THAT MATCH**!  Yea we would love the new contents if the game would be fine, but it is NOT. Try fix the game, make it REALLY **ENJOYABLE** again, than invest in new content.\r\nThis is my true opinion about the game right now. Maybe some will share my opinion maybe not. That&#039;s it. Truth hurts and so League these days. Yea, you can say &quot; If u don&#039;t like, don&#039;t play it&quot; but I used to love playing this game, spending several hours each day and want that back.","replies":[{"poster":"Nemin","date":"2018-11-21T22:00:07.971+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Helló, ez a magyar fórum, kérlek írj ide magyarul.\n\nA problémáddal meg a játékostámogatás valószínűleg fog tudni valamit kezdeni: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/hu/requests/new","replies":[]}]}
