Look fellas, I&#039;m here since 2012 and with a few stops here and there I can say that I was part of the community as a player, ( a very satisfied one  tbh ). I remember those crazy builds, lane switching , taking random champs to random lanes and you would not end up beaten to 0/20 if you don&#039;t build your champ exactly as Mr.Rito want you to. \r\n\r\nThe fact that you can&#039;t just simply be creative and fundamental which made this game even more awesome back in the days ( don&#039;t hate me for this really LoL , Im just being nostalgic ) is kind of killing it. \r\n\r\nBUT this would be the least problematic issue since I am used to this for a pretty long time by now, but can anyone tell me how is it possible that the players on rankeds and normals are being so god damn good ?! Like come on, I&#039;m currently playing in Silver rankings and it feels like Plat or higher elo - I really don&#039;t think that this is normal at all - how come that there are that many smurfs all around the platform ? I think riot should rethink the ranked idea instead of just adding some extra leagues because this  is just not working out for them. ( this is my personal notice and opinion - don&#039;t flame me for this either ) I really can say that as a Silver player I always, like really ALWAYS managed to climb out without a problem , never needed any duo partners or help at all. I guess they are just going towards this very straight forward style where they want to  create a game suiting for the  competitive LCS league and other professionals.  I was thinking so much about this since I love the game itself, pumped so much money in it and it feels like I&#039;m about to give it all up and just quit for good. {{item:2056}}{{item:3070}}{{item:2056}}{{item:3070}}\r\n\r\nCan someone share their opinions, thoughts ? I feel like one of those players who did not come yesterday and we know stuff what some of us might not know and I can feel that there is an issue beneath the surface I just can&#039;t really point at it atm.\r\n\r\nI also apologize for the lenghty topic,  please take your time reading it, I&#039;m looking forward for your reply.\r\n\r\nRegards Summoners!","replies":[{"poster":"Nemin","date":"2018-11-21T21:43:32.974+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Szia, ez a magyar fórum, ahol a magyar **játékosokkal** tudsz beszélni. Se a Támogatás, se a Riot itt meg nem talál téged.\n\nAz első problémád nem értem. Hisz épp erre próbálják kihegyezni az egészet az új rúnákkal, meg azzal a förtelmes szezonhypeoló videóval, ami miatt sokan hőbörögtek, hogy \"merd megtörni a metát\".\n\nA második problémád pedig egy olyan baj, amivel sokat nem lehet tenni. Ahogy egyre több játékos játszik egyre több időt az ügyesség átlaga szép lassan növekedni kezd. Ami régen platig juttatott, most lehet csak goldig fog. Lépést kell tartani. Smurfökkel pedig csak ritkán találkozhatsz, ugyanis a rendszer pár játékon belül kiszűri az ilyenek nagyját és őket egymás ellen rakja be.\n\n---\n\nIn case you're an actual English speaker, this is the Hungarian forum for people who speak Hungarian.
