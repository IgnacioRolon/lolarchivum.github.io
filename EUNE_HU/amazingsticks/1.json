If sharing your creations here and advertising yourself are really important to you, the least you could do is to speak this forum's language properly. If you'd like to share your creations in English, then please create a discussion on the [English Boards](http://boards.eune.leagueoflegends.com/en/). This is uncomfortable to those Hungarian players on the Boards who do not speak English, and this is not comfortable to you either that you might get feedbacks in Hungarian -- and as I found out, you don't speak the language. Please next time be aware that I might remove your discussion if you share it in the improper language. :)\n\nMerry Christmas, \nDr Keppo","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nemin","date":"2016-12-24T19:08:03.343+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I downvoted this for three things:\nThe clickbait title,\nThe cancerous player\nWriting in english on the hungarian forums.\n\n---\n\"Nem in, hanem out\"\n[[GYIK és Szabályzat]](http://boards.eune.leagueoflegends.com/hu/c/altalanos-beszelgetes/0krXUB6R-a-farumok-szabaalyzata-aos-gyik) [[Fórumos Addonok]](http://boards.eune.leagueoflegends.com/hu/c/minden-egyeb/AehaAUjI-nemin-addonjainak-listaaja)","replies":[]}]}
