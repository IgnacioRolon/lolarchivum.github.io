The knockback still excludes the last target he  dashed to or attacked.\r\n        NEW: For 3 seconds after casting Crescent Guard, Xin Zhao creates a zone around himself and will block damage dealt to him from champions outside of his guard area. The duration of this stance is extended slightly every time Xin Zhao attacks an enemy champion.","replies":[{"poster":"The One ESCANOR","date":"2017-09-12T05:49:47.943+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lehet tudni arról valamit hogy fog-e új splash artot kapni az alap skinje ?
