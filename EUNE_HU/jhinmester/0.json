I reinstalled the game and even ran &quot;Initate Full Repair&quot;. Guess what? The game dies every match resulting in braindamage due to flame, destroyed fun of my teammates and me.\n\nSeriously. What is the problem? I know multiple players who have the same problem. On the top of that &quot;Leave Buster&quot; punishes INNOCENT people with longer q&#039;s. Rly? Why?\n\nBan me for verbal abuse if I reply something ugly to another player or if I start the whine war, but hey... Why  do you ban people for game crash? How am I responsible? I have got a quite strong PC running games smoothly. I would like to play LoL sometimes with friends. \n\nI kindly ask the support team and the community to advise How to fix the game? \n\nYes I have already opened a ticket. No result. It is time to try the forums....\n\nThank You! \n{{summoner:4}}","replies":[{"poster":"kiskeni","date":"2019-01-10T07:41:48.508+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello, szerintem itt nem fogsz találni segítséget.
