Not really a great decision when you could get someone with a decent shield or heal to essentialy do they same thing. Janna, thresh , leona, lulu , aliistair all better options really.

No real team disengage (a coin only goes so far) and lack of built in escapes. If your flash is down suddenly playing aggressive at all in lane becomes a bad idea. It would only take one decent gank while youre pushed and suddenly your lane is behind. Unlike champions like janna, with her q's , alistair with knock backs, ect. Its just alot easier to lock her down. Don't get me wrong she is fun to play and defiantly not a \"bad\" champion- i just think that she lacks alot of elements that are really key to winning team fights considering the meta is currently tanks making it alot harder to lock down any good targets. That being said- in solo que she is probably fine its only really in team 5's and premades that you have to put that much thought into it because odds are even if you want to synergize getting solo que lobbys to work together is tough.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"chipndip1","date":"2015-06-27T16:09:14.322+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea, and I've had a good deal of supports piss me the hell off just as much as I've had adcs that have.

A Karthus ult only deals like 200 damage at rank 1, while Soraka's ult heals for 350 I believe\n\nBut late game, the heal will only be enough to save the person who would have died, Its unlikely to counter the full damage. Since a Karthus ult when he's near full build can deal up to 1000 damage. More if he's fed.","replies":[{"poster":"Ariel the Cruel","date":"2015-06-28T00:11:51.834+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Raka can still almost nullify his ult with equal build.\nProbalem is, you can't do it on a support budget.
