This is bringing back memories of having to write them all down on notebook paper and search through them in game. Please don't make me do it again! Being able to create custom item sets for each champion was 100% my favorite feature ever added to league of legends. It makes life so much easier. I still remember the day when we were first able to make item sets and I was so happy! Then much later on you guys even made it so that we could save them on your side instead of on our own computers! So much progress had been made, and then when I downloaded the new client my heart sank when I realized there was no longer any item sets. It looks nice and all but I just felt absolutely crushed.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-25T04:44:02.753+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not entirely sure that the future of Item Sets has been 100% decided yet. If I recall correctly, the Client Update team is still having discussions about Item Sets and if/when they would fit into the New Client.\n\nSince I'm not a part of the team that works on the New Client, I don't have an update to provide you. I recommend leaving your feedback on this or anything else related to the client on our [**Client Discussion Boards**](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/alpha-client-discussion). If you have any other questions, let me know.","replies":[{"poster":"Arcticc Foxx","date":"2017-01-25T13:20:14.879+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm glad to hear there may still be hope! I'm sorry I didn't realize there was a specific board for Client discussion. I may go ahead and post my feelings there as well.
