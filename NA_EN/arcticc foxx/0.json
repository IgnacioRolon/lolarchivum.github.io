I know that item sets are now saved server-side so it shouldn't affect the item sets anymore if i do a repair now right? I figure it won't affect them anymore, but when i saw that message pop up I just wanted to double-check. I put a lot of work into those items sets and i want to make sure i won't lose them.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-29T15:23:27.867+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Item sets used to be saved locally, and even though that notice still exists your sets should be saved server side.  Just in case, though, I recommend writing down any lists you have to be sure.  I believe you'll be just fine, though!","replies":[]}]}
