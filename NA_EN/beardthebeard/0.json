Trying to balance for bad players just wrecks the competitive game, and guess what? low elo will still suck, because what is \"good\" is meaningless at that level.\nBalancing is a lot harder than just buffing and nerfing stuff, it all has side effects on the metagame and other champions - look at what happened to ahri.\n\nCome back with convincing arguments.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RenownedWheat42","date":"2017-04-24T03:33:11.523+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yi performs pretty solid at low elo and he even sees play at the challenger level (Froggen plays like one or two games with a Yi every time I catch him streaming).\n\nRyze DOMINATES when someone knows how to play him, and they didn't want that dominance to be so easy to obtain, hence the nerfs.\n\nAzir is a Ryze case as well.\n\nRiot not wanting \"strong\" champions would mean you'd see people like Ivern, Kha'zix, Graves, Lee, Syndra, Orianna, and Rumble nerfed into the ground due to their outstanding use in LCS.
