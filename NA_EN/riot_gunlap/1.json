Was playing some stuff on the PBE yesterday and today and wanted to give some personal feedback about the sounds.\r\n\r\nI like what was done with the distinctive turret shots for blue and red. Blue felt like the shots were a lot \"cooler\" than red's. As for personal taste, it felt like Blue's turret shots were a bit too soft. Almost too \"whispy\", and not as noticeable as red's. The solution might be as simple as turning up the gain, but in terms of the mix, red's shots were a lot more present than blue's. \r\n\r\nAs for red's turret shots, I believe that it sounds too much like a \"thud\" of a laser. When I see the animation attacking, it feels like more of a fiery, or beamy whoosh than a thud. I definitely like what's happening there though, and it's certainly progressing in the right direction. \r\n\r\nJust my two gold! Keep it up!","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Eno","date":"2014-10-24T00:24:40.755+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the feedback!\n\nWe'll be doing a lot of play - testing of these new sounds in the weeks to come.\n\nAs a heads up, not sure if it's relevant to your notes, but the sounds should be different (softer/less complex) for when each side's towers are attacking minions vs. attacking Champs; did you notice this to be the case?\n\nThanks again! =)","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Gunlap","date":"2014-10-25T00:20:19.192+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there, Eno! Upon further investigation:\n\nI can hear a slight difference between when the turret is attacking a minion vs a champion, however, to my ear, off of standard Logitech speakers, it sounds simply like a decibel change. The difference is not significant enough for me to realize. As for the Blue side turret, I can hear the sound when it hits a minion or champion, but its initial firing sound is too soft for me to realize it has left the turret from only an acoustical standpoint. Whereas the red side does not have this issue.\n\nI have some other notes, so I figure I might as well respond here, though I imagine a \"megathread\" of sorts will be up soon?\n\nRight now, the Red Side Fountain has a really loud engine sound.  I cannot tell its purpose. as the only thing that would emit such a sound would be the crystal being held by the statue, and even then, its sound is just too overbearing. Probably an oversight, though I do like to pretend I'm in a spaceship when healing up and shopping in fountain.\n\nI admire the pitches chosen for the Nexus' to resonate with - Blue side on a G and Red side on a C. I imagine the new background music may be in that key? :P\n\nGlad to help! :)","replies":[]}]}]}
