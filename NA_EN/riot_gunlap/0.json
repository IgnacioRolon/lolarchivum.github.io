I like to write music, and wrote this theme for Ziggs by request from one of Riot! Just wanted to share it with the community and get as much feedback as possible. Always looking to improve. Any composers have tips on how to get the string runs to sound less choppy?\r\n\r\n[\"Bombastic!\"](https://soundcloud.com/emmanuel-lagumbay/bombastic-ziggs-theme)\r\n\r\nThank you, and I hope you enjoy!","replies":[{"poster":"C3Sound","date":"2014-10-10T18:18:39.878+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"We just listened to this a few minutes ago!

I'm hearing some Cinebrass and East West samples in here.  Do you have LASS?  It's expensive, but has incredibly realistic samples.  May help the choppy string runs.\n\nAs for other feedback, It'd be cool to hear you expand on this theme.  It feels like a short teaser, which isn't a bad thing, but I want to hear the song develop into something that takes you on a journey.  If you write another League inspired theme (would love to hear a track for a void champion), then feel free to post it up!","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Gunlap","date":"2014-10-13T18:38:38.705+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, NoTAR! Thanks for the feedback. Yes, the brass are CB Core and my strings are Cinematic Strings. The EW libraries are mostly the woodwinds and percussion. I haven't looked into LASS before, but I'll start checking out their stuff. I still have my eyes on CineStrings, which will route me about the same price once I get KONTAKT. It definitely IS expensive :P\n\nTeaser is probably the right term for this one! Both this, and the Orianna piece are ones I feel can be expanded over time. I'm going to be writing a Singed piece next, and I just invited some friends over to help me consume the... instruments I'll be using for it... I think a void champion will be a good challenge after this one, though! :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"dialMARK4acti0n","date":"2014-10-10T16:25:37.724+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's very cool!
