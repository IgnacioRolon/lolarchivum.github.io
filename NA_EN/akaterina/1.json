Sometimes retrying works, other times I have to restart the client 3-4 times before it connects... It is not a problem with my internet as I am using it to type this/listen to music on youtube with no issues. It lets me connect to the main client ok, it's just when I go to get in a game it goes to a black screen and tells me that it cannot connect.","replies":[{"poster":"Akaterina","date":"2016-11-02T01:32:12.466+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"OK so...

The thing is though it happens at random so I can't tell if anything I am doing is actually having an effect. It also seems to happen more often after 5-6 pm EST, eg I can play throughout the day then after dinner ect is when I start having connection issues. It only happens with LoL, if I use pingtest it shows no packet loss or anything to multiple other servers.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-26T04:06:33.881+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because patches only change local files inside your League directory, they're *very unlikely* to affect your connection.
