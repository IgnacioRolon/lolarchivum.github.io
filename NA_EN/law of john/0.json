We were at champ select, and I had renke.  It goes to my turn to pick a champ, I hit lock in, thinking I would get rene. Yea, apprently, rito servers thinks I actualy wanted IVERN instead of renke.  Is this a known bug, or is something bonky?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-16T19:05:38.073+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's a really strange issue, and I can't think of anything causing that.  Maybe the possibility of a sync issue if your network had a hiccup, but I haven't heard of any client issues causing that.  Are you on the new client?  If so I recommend submitting this over at the[ client discussion](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/alpha-client-discussion) boards so testers can look into it.  Hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
