Why Eu -> Tr is free but Na -> Tr is not? You guys did it for free in 2014-15 I don't remember. Can someone just explain me, why?  Now on Tr server, everyone playing with 9 ping but I'm playing with 170 ping on Na server. \r\n\r\nSevgili Rioterlar ve Sihirdarlar, bir soru sormak istiyorum.  Eu -> Tr geçişi ücretsizken neden Na -> Tr geçişi değil?  2014-15 yılında Na de dahildi bu defa neden değil lütfen açıklar mısınız? Şu an Tr sunucusunda herkes 9 ping ile oynuyor ama ben Na de 170 ping ile oynuyorum.\r\n\r\n1 year ago (Turkish); http://tr.leagueoflegends.com/tr/news/riot-games/announcements/turkiye-sunucusuna-gecisler-ucretsiz\r\n\r\n4 days ago (Turkish); http://tr.leagueoflegends.com/tr/news/riot-games/announcements/turkiye-sunucusuna-gecisler-1-rp\r\n\r\n> NA {{summoner:4}} TR  {{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}}","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-07-22T18:12:57.357+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Free transfers are usually not a result of a sale or marketing, but a necessity for player support.  These free transfers are usually for players who play from that specific region, and is offered to them so they can have a better connection and experience playing there, versus a far off region.  The NA region is very far from Turkey, so the ping is going to be high due to the physical distance.  We don't have visibility on a region's specific campaigns, though, so your best bet would be to submit a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) so we can find some options best for you!","replies":[]}]}
