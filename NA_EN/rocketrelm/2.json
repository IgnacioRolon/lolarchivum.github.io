Sejuani surged on a lot of popularity and power, but as the hype surrounding Cinderhulk faded and Devourer rises up, everyone stopped playing Sejuani almost entirely. I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve seen a single Sejuani except when I&#039;ve played her since patch 5.11. She was nerfed after the Cinderhulk was placed in a more reasonable spot, before people switched over and partly on the back of imagined extra strength.\r\n\r\nDespite being nerfed down herself solely because of Cinderhulk, Sejauni hasn&#039;t received any compensation. Further, because of her classification as a Trample Tank who wants to dive the enemies, rather than a Support Tank, she isn&#039;t being compensated for the armor changes which directly hurt her itemization.\r\n\r\nCan we expect Sejuani to see any compensation for the &#039;layered nerfs&#039;?

If there's something she's supposed to be good at but just isn't, that's probably worth addressing. If there's something she needs to not be so bad at in order to have a fighting chance, that could also be worth addressing.\n\nHowever, if it's just that the Devourer-dominated solo queue meta doesn't favor her at the moment, that's probably less a reason to adjust her, since we can sometimes get into trouble for buffing champions into a meta they don't really fit in with.","replies":[{"poster":"Jeddy017","date":"2015-08-11T17:39:00.008+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":2,"body":"> since we can sometimes get into trouble for buffing champions into a meta they don't really fit in with.\n\nYeah because when a meta that they actually fit with comes along,they will be stronger than they need to be.","replies":[{"poster":"manbearswine","date":"2015-08-11T18:19:21.670+0000","up_votes":31,"down_votes":8,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Jeddy017,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=PJHonO1G,comment-id=00090000,timestamp=2015-08-11T17:39:00.008+0000)\n>\n> Yeah because when a meta that they actually fit with comes along,they will be stronger than they need to be.\n\n_If_  that meta ever comes along.\n\nFace it,tanks have been strong for what? 3-4 months? now assassins being shoved down our throats again.\nSee you in 3 years sejuani.","replies":[{"poster":"NvrGivUp","date":"2015-08-11T19:05:03.014+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"I just think that Sated Devourer is a really, really strong and a little bit overpowered.

I guess they do want him for LCS big plays.\n\nRengar. He's not the most mobile assassin out there. While he has some of the most burst, he's more vulnerable to cc than others. Tired of him ulting you? Buy a damn pink. At least Rengar doesn't have a short cd on a dash that lets him dodge every attempt to lock him down with cc.\n\nTrue; her q does grant a bit much in mobility.\n\nYasuo is hard to play. That's kinda the opposite of free elo. Free elo is playing a champion that's completely OP and easy to use. Yasuo is high risk, and high reward.\n\nZed isn't weak, but it's not like this buff will make him totally OP and have zero counterplay. Did I mention there's this thing called a QSS, Zhonya's, armor, and cc? With the delay on his ult being reduced to .5 seconds, there's still time to cc him. Most Zeds want to apply their burst to make sure it will kill before going to their shadow.\n\nI don't see any of the other champions on the list doing % max health true damage and having a 6-2 second cd on something that not only makes their auto-attacks stronger, but allows them to escape any skillshots (that can also stealth her during her ult).\n\nWell, I don't know why Sejuani is not getting armor compensation.\n\nBut, it's not just MY opinion. Not many people would watch competitive play if it's just a lot of unkillable tanks slowing, knocking each other back, knocking each other up, stunning, and snaring each other. This isn't necessarily starting assassin meta. It's just giving small buffs to some assassins (and when I say permastun, I also mean knockups and knockbacks because they also prevent you from taking any actions for a period of time.\n\nXin has limited mobility. As does Zed. His w still has a 14 second cd at max rank, and, even with cdr, that's still more than enough time to kill him or lock him down.\n\nZed's ult has a delay on the shadow swapping. He's one of the more mobile champions, but at least he requires effort.\n\nHaving assassins facerolling everything. That's not how assassins are played in the LCS. If they simply facerolled, they would be dead before they could burst down a level 1 Master Yi. Facerolling is most easily accomplished when you're a tank. Like Sejuani back during the Cinderhulk meta. Cause you're unkillable and have cc and an escape (not all tanks have a kit like that). If you scroll down a bit, you'll see Nintendude say that he believes Cinderhulk reduces the amount of skill required to play as a jungler. A shit ton of health kinda does that. Assassins don't have piles of health so in competitive play, they cannot afford to make mistakes. Tanks can.\n\nhttp://na.lolesports.com/articles/feel-burn-cinderhulk-tactics-nintendude-and-karsa\n\nClearly we have different opinions on cinderhulk meta and assassin meta that cannot really be changed, so, I suggest we leave the topic alone.","replies":[{"poster":"manbearswine","date":"2015-08-12T14:34:40.744+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Spizzle9000,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=PJHonO1G,comment-id=00090000000000020000000000010000,timestamp=2015-08-12T13:38:37.356+0000)\n>\n> Well, I dunno.

Buy a damn pink.\n\nEnough with this garbage,just stop listening to bronzies which tell you this excuse.\nIt doesn't work.\nThe range of the warning is too short,there isn't time to react,by the time you drop the pink ward you're already dead.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOGDFOeuVlM\n\nLook at it,mark appears,0.25 seconds after you are dead,dropping a pink ward,reacting to his position,using cc,you will be dead first.\n\n>At least Rengar doesn't have a short cd on a dash that lets him dodge every attempt to lock him down with cc.\n\nIt really doesn't matter if you're already dead.\n\n> Yasuo is hard to play. That's kinda the opposite of free elo. Free elo is playing a champion that's completely OP and easy to use. Yasuo is high risk, and high reward.\n\nNo,he's not,yasuo is hard to play MECHANICALLY,his decision making is binary for the most part,he is still free elo,you just need to commit to learning him MECHANICALLY,you can still have shit decision making and positioning,it won't matter.\n\n> Zed isn't weak, but it's not like this buff will make him totally OP and have zero counterplay. \n\nIt doesn't change the fact there are about 100 champions who deserve a buff way more than he does.\nThe issue is that riot is playing favorites with assassins and shoving them down our throats,not how large the buffs are or whether or not they are deserved.\n\n>Did I mention there's this thing called a QSS, Zhonya's, armor, and cc? With the delay on his ult being reduced to .5 seconds, there's still time to cc him. Most Zeds want to apply their burst to make sure it will kill before going to their shadow.\n\nDid I mention there's splitpushing and the need to build items which will help you against things which aren't zed?\nEveryone stack armor...why is vlad 20/0?\n \n> I don't see any of the other champions on the list doing % max health true damage and having a 6-2 second cd on something that not only makes their auto-attacks stronger, but allows them to escape any skillshots (that can also stealth her during her ult).\n\nSo what? kog shreds hp faster,from a larger range,and at least her dash has a 2 sec cd,I can't say the same about kalita or yasuo,she also actually has drawbacks,her kit is entirely low ranged and she offers no poke or waveclear for her team.\n\n> Well, I don't know why Sejuani is not getting armor compensation.\n\nCause #lcsbigplays\n\n> But, it's not just MY opinion. Not many people would watch competitive play if it's just a lot of unkillable tanks slowing, knocking each other back, knocking each other up, stunning, and snaring each other. This isn't necessarily starting assassin meta. It's just giving small buffs to some assassins (and when I say permastun, I also mean knockups and knockbacks because they also prevent you from taking any actions for a period of time.\n\nAnd I stopped watching it because I find the lack of counterplay of assassins and idiotic shit like lantern ganks disgusting,you see an \"outplay\",I want to throw up.\n\n> Xin has limited mobility. As does Zed. His w still has a 14 second cd at max rank, and, even with cdr, that's still more than enough time to kill him or lock him down.\n\nToo bad zed also has his ult,which is actually a double dash,oh,and builds botrk as core...often followed with yomumus.\n \n> Zed's ult has a delay on the shadow swapping. He's one of the more mobile champions, but at least he requires effort.\n\nOh boy a 1 second(soon to be 0.5) window to do something to him...as long as his w is down ofc,and with the speedboost from botrk...yeah,lots of room here.\n \n> Having assassins facerolling everything. That's not how assassins are played in the LCS. If they simply facerolled, they would be dead before they could burst down a level 1 Master Yi.\n\nExcept that they do that all the time,roaming with assassin doesn't take much skill,if your opponent doesn't see you 2 miles away,they will get facerolled to death.\n\n>Facerolling is most easily accomplished when you're a tank. Like Sejuani back during the Cinderhulk meta. Cause you're unkillable and have cc and an escape (not all tanks have a kit like that). If you scroll down a bit, you'll see Nintendude say that he believes Cinderhulk reduces the amount of skill required to play as a jungler. A shit ton of health kinda does that. Assassins don't have piles of health so in competitive play, they cannot afford to make mistakes.

You may as well remove her w from her kit at this point. I understand the previous AP nerf she had on her e so that she couldn't go glass cannon and burst people down but the multiple nerfs on her w from magic damage on 12% to 6% of her health just made her completely useless save for being a walking ultimate. \n\nI think everybody understands that tanks shouldn't be doing lots of damage (though Nasus, Irelia, Volibear and a few others that build full tank seem to do just that), but they need to do SOME damage. She basically was given all the power of a support after those nerfs instead of a tanky initiator. If she was given a kit where she was primarily a peeler and was in a support role I could understand the horrible damage output but her kit asks her to be in the middle of the enemy team putting permafrost on everybody and doing sustained aoe damage. \n\nShe already has a really bad early game, long cooldowns on her good spells (q and r) and can't fall back on the overpowered cinderhulk anymore. Plus righteous glory, randuins and frozen mallet are all getting the nerf treatment which will only make her worse. Pro streamers tell their viewers not to pick her anymore and they're right. Nautilus, volibear, amumu, and gragas have all passed her by and the devourer champs have passed the forementioned tank junglers by (except for gragas.) \n\nDo whatever research you guys need to do on her power levels but I think the nerf from 12 to 6% of health as magic damage was too harsh, especially if you are nerfing all the hp items as well. I think everybody would be happy with 8%. I don't know of any other circumstances where a champion was literally nerfed by 50% of their damage output because of an item that synergized too well with and was left that way even after that item was heavily nerfed.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Karn Bishop","date":"2015-08-11T23:46:51.544+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RiotRepertoir,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=PJHonO1G,comment-id=0009,timestamp=2015-08-11T17:35:51.927+0000)\n>\n> To this, I would ask if you think she's able to reliably perform her intended function(s) at the moment.

Her abilities are on somewhat long CDs. You could make it so she gets a small refund if she hits anyone with an ability. Alternatively you could improve the CD scaling on her abilities. Specifically her ultimate. 100 Second CD on her ult post FH nerf means she will only have her ult half the time. Buffing it to 120/100/80 Seconds would go a long way to making her better. Improving her other CD's by 1-2 seconds would also go a long way to make up for the loss of FH.\n\n2)  Partial Revert the W nerfs. It was obnoxious with the Cinderhulk item but even a full revert of these wouldn't make her oppressive again. No reason to keep her down after the nerfs to what made her dominant. I mean you wouldn't gut fizz right at the same time as removing DFG would you?","replies":[]},{"poster":"GundayMonday","date":"2015-08-13T13:27:02.782+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"She needs some extra armor early. {{item:3110}} is a core item on her (usually build it second for the cdr, 100 armor, mana, and aura.

She was tuned to be in a more balanced state when the meta favored her. Now the meta does not favor her but she still has the same nerfs from when it did, leaving her even weaker than she was prior to the rise of Cinderhulk junglers.\n\nWouldn't pushing her to a more balanced state now and then tuning her if the tank-centric meta comes back be better than leaving her behind as a result of her previous nerfs? You guys preemptively nerfed Shyvana when devourer was released. The same thing could happen if some global tank buff was happening.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Calibretto9","date":"2015-08-11T14:32:41.681+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":2,"body":"Sej is fine and does not need buffs.
