The story itself was solid. The champion updates were helpful. The concept of releasing a champion during a story event, then having the story fundamentally change the character and require a whole new skin to represent the lore progression, while everyone that owns him gets the Classic skin &#039;and&#039; the new skin, is great.\n\nActual disabling a champion from the game because of the lore is not.\n\nThere was no reason to disable the champion for this event. One solution is to release Spooky Gangplank to everyone, as China did. Another solution is to perhaps put a gray tint on GP in all games, and have the shopkeep react with surprise that he is there. Perhaps make it so that the updates are timed such that the unveiling of New Gangplank Skin actually coincides with when he hits the rift, so that there isn&#039;t a days-long length of time when the GP new skin is out and he is pronounced alive, but players &#039;still&#039; can&#039;t play him.\n\nRiot should make sure that when they create this interaction between the player base and the game and the lore, it is always adding something (the player contest that resulted in the creation of the Ionian Boots), not subtracting (removing GP for extended time). There are many ways to have players interact with the game and the lore. There is absolutely no reason or need for Riot to ever take away from the player experience to do so.\n\nFull disclosure, I have rarely if ever played Gangplank before. I played him a couple times after the rework, and in my very first ARAM, but that&#039;s mostly it. But I completely sympathize with GP players who may feel locked out of the experience, and feel like there are creative solutions to accomplish this goal without doing this harm.\n\n**TL;DR**\nThe sole purpose of this petition is to make it clear that whatever good the surrounding events of the Bilgewater Event, the actual disabling of gangplank from the game had **entirely nothing** to do with it. Riot should not walk away from the update thinking that the disabling of a champion in any way had any positive effects. This could have happened in the same way without the disabling, and everything would be appreciably better for it.\n\nThank you for your time.","replies":[{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2015-08-03T23:22:34.102+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I disagree. For one, some people ACTUALLY thought that they were removing him from the game permanently, and making people panic and look ridiculous is always a good thing. Secondly, it helps people remember that lore is, in fact, an actual thing. People wonder 'why is GP dead?' and then go check out the lore and maybe get interested in it. As a lore fan, I am also hyped that lore had an actual affect on the game, though I'm not sure if that meant they went back on their 'two separate things' decision or if they're just inconsistent.\n\nIt wasn't for very long and it's a game with 125 other champions. Riot has also stated that applying the second visual update took longer than they wanted to do, so if this happens in the future, it will probably be for a shorter amount of time.\n\nI think the benefits outweighed the negatives.","replies":[{"poster":"RocketRelm","date":"2015-08-04T04:03:11.849+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're literally ignoring the point I made. There didn't need to be ANY negatives. I'm excited about the new lore as well, but why have it be some bad and some good when it can be 100% good?\n\nI've seen the thoughts of a lot of people that have played GP. The response has been **universally** negative on this subject. I love the idea of lore interacting with the game proper, and what this has done is make people _afraid of the lore interacting with the game_.\n\nThe only conceivable benefits are to generate mild curiosity, and there are far better ways to do that.\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2015-08-04T04:17:13.188+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because it's impossible to make something 100% good, there has to be negatives to everything. I, for example, was immensely annoyed at the complete disconnect between game and lore, and as such I enjoyed connecting the two. If they had not killed Gangplank, I would have been annoyed, because it would mean that lore has no impact on the game proper. \n\nDon't take the forums as a 100% representative sample of the playerbase. The only people who came here to complain about GP being disabled were people who came here to complain about GP being disabled. People who did not care about GP being disabled were playing the game or doing something else.\n\nOh, and your last paragraph is the most passive aggressive shit. Stop being whiny. If you want to discuss whether this was a good idea or not, don't do the 'all of you are stupid!' sort of thing.","replies":[{"poster":"RocketRelm","date":"2015-08-04T04:50:49.830+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The last bit was a bit of frustration at the general idea, and doesn't especially serve the conversation, so I'll ditch that part.\n\nAnyway, I haven't only looked at Boards for my feedback on the GP rework. I've looked in several places with a fair amount of feedback and the consensus is \"the disabling was bad, the rest of it was good\". I'm actually with you in that the gameplay and lore never needed to be split, but that's an entirely different subject.\n\nMy point is that they could have \"killed\" Gandplank without actually disabling him.","replies":[{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2015-08-04T05:02:57.417+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think it might have been a better idea to disable every GP skin but Spooky GP.

But for a lot of people, who own maybe 12 champions, and enjoy maybe 2-4, that's losing 1 champion out of 3, which 'is' a big deal.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Binxy Prime","date":"2015-08-04T04:39:38.235+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree, I don't play much GP but there were a few times I felt like playing him and I couldn't.
