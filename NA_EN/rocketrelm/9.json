You can always TRY to out duel someone, dodge a skillshot, bush juke auto attacks or the like.  It's a personal contest, plus or minus how fed one of you is.\n\nAgainst an assassin, your survival is half your choices (not being accessible to them) and half your team's (moving together and protecting you).  If you're Jinx and the enemy team has a fed Zed you need to be very careful about where you move.  Granted, it's not at all impossible.  Many high elo players prefer to climb as adc's because just being smart about where you go can prevent an assassin from being able to get to you.  However, low elo players lack smart choices often enough, with everyone doing their own thing and not everyone knowing what's smart to do and when.  So if your team catches the jungler and kills him, then half of you push mid while half of you decide it's smarter to get dragon or farm wolves... not much you can do there other than ping and hope they listen. \n\nBut yeah, assassins punish poor positioning, poor coordination and poor decisions.  All of these are hideously common in solo queue, even in higher elos... though they're less common there.  The rambo \"I got this\" mentality is everywhere in low elo games and Zed THRIVES on that.  Is he safe?  Yeah.  But if your team is smart enough to cockblock his ult-dive there isn't much else he can do other than run away and watch you get objectives or stomp his team.  Assuming he's not dead, of course.  \n\nShort version... don't blame zed... blame your teammates and yourself.

What I dislike is when they are strong and have very little that can stop them. Example, I never thought Akali was absolutely unfun to fight against. Sure, her damage WAS absurd, but when team fights started, she became a lot easier to deal with. That is because she can dash to an enemy, but then has no way to get out. She also doesn't serve much of a purpose outside of killing squishies. So if you were able to contain her in lane, her impact would be noticeably worse. \n\nAn example of a champ I absolutely hate facing is Zed. Even when he isn't strong, I find him extremely unfun to play against. He can kill squishy targets easily, no harm in that. That is his job after all. What I completely dislike is the combination of all of the following on top of his assassination power.\nDecent wave clear, INCREDIBLE split pushing power, and incredibly easy to escape from bad situations. If a Zed ever gets behind, the good ones will simply split push. Even when behind, Zed has a very strong 1v1 match up, so he basically forces your team to make a decision. Either try to take an objective or win a team fight now, or send someone to deal with him. If you decide on the latter, then you have to make that call the moment you see Zed split pushing. If you hesitate, Zed's additional AD bonus can easily allow him to take a tower. On the other hand, if Zed gets ahead, then it becomes difficult to punish his assassination attempts. Unlike Akali, Zed can use his W before ulting on his target, press Q+W then one auto, W out and then the ult finishes the kill. So your counterplay options are to either lock him down when he ults, or have a QSS or zhonyas. The only risk in that scenario Zed has to deal with is the potential of being lock downed when he goes in. That window of counter play opportunity is maybe a second. If you have a Zhonyas or QSS, Zed still gets away and gets some damage on you, but doesn't kill you. Still Zed basically traded his ult for your item active. That will hurt his assassination potential next fight, but it also stops you from having that crucial zhonyas/QSS.\n\nBasically, Zed is a champion that feels bad to play against because when you beat him in lane, he can still split push amazingly. When he gets ahead, he is a super safe assassin. Either way, it feels like there is very little you can do other than hope that the player on Zed is just bad at making calls and tries to team fight when he is 1/10.\n\nYas is between Akali and Zed to me. He has clear weaknesses that can be exploited and clear strengths. One thing I dislike is how people think that using E on a minion to close a gap, press Q after E ends to land some poke, then using E to get back out is hard. Just a preference thing. The other thing I dislike is his windwall. It is so stupidly easy and forgiving to block a projectile with and there are plenty of projectiles that it shouldn't stop. When I can use windwall in the OPPOSITE direction and still block a projectile, that is just wrong. It gives Yas so much time to use it. As long as the projectile doesn't hit Yas, windwall can stop it. Windwall should work where the wall itself is formed at the tip of the blade and not on Yas's model. That way he actually has to direct the windwall and can't just use a panic reaction. Other than that, if he gets behind, he is easy to deal with. If he gets ahead, he does his job well. When I outplay a Yasuo, it feels good because I know that I just made it harder for him to have an impact on the game. When I get outplayed by a Yasuo, I don't feel cheated because that is what he does and I know that he will have to put himself in a position where I have a clear window to outplay him later on.\n\nTo sum everything up, when counter play is present and clear, I don't mind at all when assassins are strong. When counter play is limited to 1 small opportunity, then I hate when that assassin is strong.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Alsek","date":"2016-02-21T23:55:18.358+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Being killed and not even being allowed to react isn't actually a fun mechanic.\n\nThis isn't ONLY a problem with assassins ({{champion:1}} {{champion:78}}) but they've traditionally been the worst offenders.

Even if you balance it, heck, even if you're feeling positive more time than negative, trust me it's not healthy.\n\nHigh risk high reward just encourages people to have inflated heads after succeeding in that one moment where everything matters. It doesn't have the mercy of statistical odds letting them fail _eventually_ if they have to keep trying, like with supports or tanks, they just succeed once (one combo) and they don't need to deal with risking their lives any more, while a tank or support may need to engage or peel multiple times when the distance between the teams increases or decreases against them. Even if they are balanced to fail a lot due to high risk, the fact they're not poke reliant and don't have to rely on multiple successes makes them look better in comparison, while an assassin can just stack all the facto stat give them an advantage, and do one combo to get a kill.\n\nAnd that's not even touching on champions who have a high reward but lower risk.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jasiwel","date":"2016-02-20T05:47:27.166+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"I enjoy them when there are enough opportunities to fight against them. While many insist they were weak in Season 5, I think they were best balanced during that time simply because your team could often make them risk everything to kill you as a carry. Or if you are the Tank/Fighter, you could actually stop them just before they 100-0'd your ADC. Talon/Zed aren't fun to play against as a carry because your window to do something depends on your ability to buy an item or have perfect positioning - which sounds okay until you realize the demands to play against them are a lot higher than they are as them. \n\nIn other words, I feel like I'm depending more on their inability than my own ability, which feels bad.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Alëk","date":"2016-02-21T02:32:24.021+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think anybody ENJOYs it when when any role aside from their main role is strong.

When they do ridiculous amounts of damage while soaking up damage AND locking you down? Nope, infact people were wishing we had assassin meta back when cinderhulk was released. Do people enjoy waveclear mages that stall out games for so long that you could've been playing 2 or even 3 games in that timespan? Nope. Do people enjoy when hypercarry ADCs with long range were meta? Nope.\n\nNo one likes whatever is strongest in a particular meta unless you're an avid player of said strong picks.","replies":[]}]}
