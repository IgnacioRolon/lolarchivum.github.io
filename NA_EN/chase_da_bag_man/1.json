When i get into the game i get around 50s and 40s even like 80 but after a few minutes of the game my fps just drops to 20s and like 10s. When i alt tab out and alt tab back in my fps comes back but eventually after a few mins to seconds it goes back down to 20s or so. I only have this problem on summoners rift. It doesnt happen when i play customs but when i play normals/ranked summmoners rift i get these drops. Its been so bad that im thinking about quitting the game :((( please someone help. Ive tried every fps booster thing and fps helper on the league page for fps help. I really need help. Thanks","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-08T01:05:16.600+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It seems like as the game goes on, the more assets are being used which is beginning to slow down your frames. Summoner's Rift also has a lot more files that need to be used than other maps, so that would make sense as well. \n\nLet's run through our [**FPS Guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting)) to hit the most typical causes of FPS drops.
