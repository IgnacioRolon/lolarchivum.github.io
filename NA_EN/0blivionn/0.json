So what i did was just try to close it and reopen it and it did the same thing. Next i tried restarting it and the same thing popped up. After that i tried changing regions , letting it update and then changing back. That worked until I started playing the game. It went well through champ select and all but up until about 5 minutes into the game it started bugging very badly. It bugged to the point of lagging but worse. When i died the timer would stop at 0 and stay there. When i would respawn it wouldnt let me move and nobody else would be on the map anymore besides me and it would put me at level 1 with 0 gold. It would eventually go back to normal but do the same thing again within 3 minutes. So i uninstalled the game and tired reinstalling it and it is still giving me a failure to update. I just pressed retry and it is working but what do I do if it does not work?","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-06-06T23:15:22.602+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you are consistently getting an Unexpected Error Message (Failure to update) and also experiencing connection issues in-game, both of these strongly indicate some sort of connection issue.
