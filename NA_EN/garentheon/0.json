While I love visual clarity for characters and theme, I think Olaf is in need of VU and to lesser extent so is Tryn.  (Both seem stable in gameplay terms (though #notmydepartment)   So rather than putting them together,  I would instead love to see greater visual difference between them.  \n\nFrom the lore perspective, Olaf is an important figure in the Winter's Claw,  under Sejuani while Tryndamere is \"closely allied\"  with Ashe.  Eventually these tribal affiliations hopefully will also further visually separate these two warriors. \n\nAnd finally if champup does get around to redoing these two (again #notmydepartment)  I would love to see the different personalities further highlighted in VO and gameplay.  Tryndamere is young berserker-- his anger pushes him beyond normal human limits. It defines him and its power allows him to survive things a normal man wouldn't.  Tryn still has a lot to learn about the world and what is worth fighting for.   \nOlaf, however I would say is  old warrior at more peace with his emotions.  He **_likes_** fighting. He's pretty happy and his search for a \"worthy\" death reflects this. (An Freudian death drive).  Olaf's not trying to prove himself or avenge anyone.","replies":[{"poster":"redfeenix","date":"2016-07-03T21:31:17.590+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey can you explain what a Writer does ?

For Champion, the Narrative person is a member of the core DNA team of the ideation phase of a champ (Design, Narrative, Art, being the three components). Working with the rest of the team, the DNA pod are responsible for the core development of the character's archetype, personality, kit, and look. \nFor Narrative, it involves a lot of research, utilizing references in relevant genres and making them something unique, developing story sketches (which are like concept art, so concept story) to hone in on the core character and get feedback and alignment with the rest of the team. \nThen, once the concept is fleshed out and approved, the Narrative writer assists in production through creative alignment, writing deliverables such as the audition documents for the voice actor, participating in the VO records to help determine the best performance and choice of actor, and then writing the bulk of the VO script for the final record. The Narrative member of the team will also be at the final record to assist the editor and director in hitting the right delivery of the lines to stay true to the intended core of the Champ. Then, of course, there are the deliverables such as the bio and the color text (which we need a better name for) and any work needed in support of the Promo team for the Champ.\nEach Narrative writer is working on at least two Champs at the same time.\n\n\nFor your second question, they both influence each other. Gameplay is paramount, but the character of the champ (lore is a different, tertiary thing) influences how they express what they do, and vice versa. It all should stem from a theme of who the Champ is. Each part (Voice, appearance, abilities, movement etc.) should feel a part of the cohesive whole.","replies":[{"poster":"Jaghatai","date":"2016-07-04T07:51:42.884+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"@Jaredan \n\nI teach Game at my university and have done so at other schools.  One of the lessons we often teach young game makers is \"Make a game not a narrative\" because often narrative gets in the way of the game and vice versa.  You end up trying to shoehorn mechanics to fit the story and try to shoehorn story to fit the mechanics.  So we teach make the game first and then write a narrative to fit the game.\n\nI've seen this backed up in other places such as the Castlevania developers answering questions around when \"Julius Belmont\" would get his story told saying things like \"When I have a game that I think will fit that story, I will tell the story\"\n\nWhat's your take on this?  Have you experienced anything like this?  I'd be curious about examples where Story and Mechanics just merged perfectly and when they caused problems for each-other. \n\nIf you choose to respond - can I use your responses in my game lectures?","replies":[{"poster":"WAAARGHbobo","date":"2016-07-04T21:22:35.314+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think I can answer this.  \n\nA game does not, generally speaking, need to be about a narrative.  (Despite our department's name)  But a game benefits from a coherent theme and having a feeling that it is trying to get across.   ( In broadest terms is the game a playful puzzle? Or a horror story?) \n\n Creating a theme and mood requires a robust internal logic the player can \"grok\" without having to spend a lot of time on.  The traditional narrative tools of character, tone, and world-building are efficient ways: to deepen a game's emotional response, help define that internal logic, and make a better overall experience for the player.  (i.e.  Though enjoyment of Pong and GTA5 may be equivalent.  The depth of emotions and experience is not.)  This work is surprisingly subtle but it needs to be absolutely coherent, specific, and mirror the gameplay. \n\n\nTo use a old media analogy a film director does not technically need a writer to tell a story.  Wong Kar Wai, Goddard, Micheal Bay, and many other directors will often just go out and shot stuff by the seat of their pants.  Some of those movies are trash (TransF2) some of them are masterpieces (Chung King Express).  But very often those types of shoots are over-budget, wasteful, and very time consuming.  When the hollywood studio system matured, having a good script became a component of making a film because it better served the desires of the audience, marketing, the needs of production planning, scheduling, and budgeting .  Directors go \"off script\" all the time-- but the script helps a large, expensive team know what they are doing.\n\nNow games are new art form and are a different beast than the linear narrative of film, so the needs are different.  \n\nOn Champion team for LoL we use what are called \"story sketches.\"  -These are short stories written after many long discussions with the Game Designer and Artist. The story is written for them.  In general the plot doesn't really mater instead it tries to capture the feeling of the character we have in development, in all of their messy emotional abstractness.  Often we write many, many, many of these stories.  They inspire gameplay and art but we write new ones as the art and gameplay change.  The last stories help all of the departments understand what feeling we are trying to create with this champ. (The power fantasy, the humor, edginess etc...)  \n\nBut the stories sketches we make for champs are not prescriptive.  They are made at the same time as the artist and designer are working.  And they are made primarily to spur conversation.  So the team is asking the right questions and getting aligned.  In our case we don't worry about story = gameplay.  We worry about character/feeling/theme helping create and explain understandable gameplay. \n\n\nhope that helps.","replies":[{"poster":"Valor Bot","date":"2016-07-04T22:14:21.843+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=WAAARGHbobo,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=M7AcAb6f,comment-id=00020004000000010000,timestamp=2016-07-04T21:22:35.314+0000)\n\n>On Champion team for LoL we use what are called &quot;story sketches.&quot;  -These are short stories written after many long discussions with the Game Designer and Artist.

However, there's a separate question about when to involve a Narrative writer in the process, as writing a plot is just one aspect of the role that we can play in game development (we are all developers, after all).\n\nThere's an ongoing occurrence in the game industry known as the Narrative Paramedic issue, (Rhianna Pratchett called this out and speaks on this matter much more eloquently than I) where Narrative writers are brought in near the end of a project to write words to put in the mouths of characters to make them, and the world of the game, make sense.\n\nTo give you a hypothetical example of how that can be an issue, imagine you are building a game. Around the table of developers you have game designers figuring out what the world of the game will be. The designers (as happens and is still espoused by some) figure out not just the gameplay on their own, they also figure out what the main themes of the world will be, what the specific themes and unique aspects of each society or area will be, who the main characters will be, etc. and decide they have something very cool. They bring in artists who then make it look cool and move beautifully.\n\nThey then turn to the fellow who has been sitting patiently in the corner and say \"Hey, George R.R. Martin, write barks for our characters would you? There's a dear chap.\"\n\nIt's a clumsy example, I know, it's meant to outline a seemingly obvious proposition (if you like George R.R. Martin, anyway): If you have someone whose craft is thematic cohesion, world building, character development and so on. why wouldn't you have that person in early to work on those elements of the game? They are aspects that are sublimated through every piece of a game experience, whether you see it on the first read or not.\n\nWorking as a team in collaboration, the designer, the artist, the narrative writer and beyond, can reinforce each element of the whole and make each element and team member better. The experience of the game is paramount, but not utilizing the craftspeople you have at your disposal until after you've made choices that will a) likely be not as good as if you'd brought them in to start with and b) inhibit what they're able to do when you do bring them in, would seem to be sub-optimal.\n\nIf each discipline has strengths that they can bring to the table, why not invite them?\n\nThe 'slows us down' argument is one that I understand.  We have have found, however, that the time saved by moving forward without that thematic cohesion baked in from the beginning means that you lose time due to creative misalignment later in production when it's much more painful to make changes. Or you just have to make do with what you have and send for the Narrative Paramedic. Again, that just doesn't seem to be ideal to me. And though I admit to being a bit of an idealist, ideals are useless if they're not practical, if they don't work in reality.\n\nWe just find that they do.\n\nIt's why we work the way we do on League. We had exactly the same problems with late stage involvement or poor communication and collaboration between different disciplines, which caused thematically discordant champions either through contradictory motivations, inconsistent themes across VO, art, gameplay and so on. We're not crowing that we've solved everything, not at all, but we do believe that working together the way we do makes us all strive to be better at what we do.\n\nThat's not to say we nail it 100% of the time, but we've learned what good looks like by starting with how we work together on teams (thanks to dedicated folks like WAARGHBobo, in fact, he wrote the first story sketch to be used in champion production) and what difference it can make when we work as partners with the same goal.\n\nIf I'm writing a comic, I'll be very keen to hear what the artists and editors have to say. They have ideas, understanding and perspectives that pertain to their field that will likely be better than mine, or at least spark better ideas between us. Also, the book will include their craft and so I want to make sure the very best of their craft is included as it will undoubtedly make for a better book. To do that I need to ensure we have a working relationship and environment that allows for us all to be at out best.\n\nWe believe the same is true for gaming. Understanding what a writer can bring to your game is the first step. Bringing in a Narrative Writer doesn't mean you have to curtail your game to bend to the need of plot. Games are much more flexible than that and so the developers must be to utilize the medium's full range of possibilities, as well as the full capabilities of their team of developers, including designers, artists, writers, engineers and many others who are vital to help something as hard to do as a game reach its full potential.\n\nA development manager asked me the other day about the core motivation of a champion that's currently in development as she didn't feel it was clearly expressed in some concept work that we'd been reviewing.\n\nMy answer didn't matter as much as the question. The fact it was asked at all makes me feel we're heading in the right direction.","replies":[{"poster":"Jaghatai","date":"2016-07-06T19:59:42.839+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you so much for the response!
