I've been fearing someone would suggest this. As an avid Rammus player, I'd like to politely list a few reasons as to not let this happen.\n\n1. League needs simple champs. \nThis is a more general comment, but it applies to Rammus. Warwick and Galio are simple. I severely hope their rework doesn't change this too much. And Rammus is simple too! Reworks have made increasingly more complex champions, and if this trend continues, I fear for the general wellbeing of the game.\n\n2. There is beauty in his kit. \nIt's the subtle things I notice. Rammus's W helps with his passive, and his E supports his W. The Q allows his E to get in range. His ult is mediocre. But see, his kit is unified, and I believe it's fair and balanced.\n\n3. Not a full VGU.\nI mean, I agree. Rammus needs an update in some regards. His model is very bland, his animations and emotes are sub-par. This aspect, his visual aspect, needs an update. His ult is also bland, and could be so much more thematically appropriate. But I honestly believe this is all that needs to change. \n\nSo, yeah, I'm not completely against a VGU for Rammus. Some parts of him do need to change. But I am against a full VGU, as this would ruin his simple, coherent, thematically appropriate, fair and balanced kit.

At least she got significant changes to her kit and art and was made pretty well all things considered. Hell Riot even listened and changed her art to accommodate the largely negative reaction to her look and in game model. \n\nBy comparison you could have got something that feels very rushed like Shen.
