Indeed, I'll be back in force at some point I'm sure.\n\n2015 was an interesting year to say the least. What occurred last year for me in my personal and professional life is still sort of reverberating beyond just those exclusive life events. I've had a lot to do, a lot to think about, and a lot to adjust to with the happenings of 2015. Honestly, everything that came out of last year put me in a better place, objectively speaking. I'm happier, stronger and more in touch with how I've grown and what I have to do to continue to do so. Growth comes from success and movement but also comes from loss and struggle. \n\nWith those struggles, those times of muscle-tearing growth, friends like Kindlejack have been and continue to be indispensable. I've learned a lot from last year. The biggest being how the people in your life matter, in what capacity they matter, and how they either help you move forward, or drag you down. I'm lucky to say that in my life I'm surrounded by the former type of people. Those who've been a beacon of light, which not only has helped me move out of the dark, but shine in a way where I can see my reflection in a way I had not before. I've been looking out to the horizon, but very much looking at the person in the mirror.\n\nThat said, yep, I'm still here. Some things are the same, some things are different. Different as they may be, I'm looking forward in 2016 with a mindset of appreciation and cautious hope. Lots to do. Lots to say. \n\nLots to be grateful for :)","replies":[{"poster":"ZiPS","date":"2016-02-16T06:23:27.582+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"It makes me happy every time I see your name pop up in the red-tracker.

Now I have the privilege of working along side him every day and it's still kind of unreal. Let me just remind you, in his stead, that we are real people and sometimes real life just takes precedent over work - no matter how passionate you are. With that said I think he'll be back on the forums in due time. He certainly inspired me to be active here even before I joined Riot so the least I can do is return the favour >:P\n\nSometimes it can also be a little unclear what each of us do at Riot. I'm a concept artist on the Skins Team; that means that I spend almost all my time designing skins for champs. IronStylus is currently a concept artist on the Champ Update; so he's designing the new look for champions on the update roster. Foundations is the team that works on updating lore and world building, and they have their own cadre of awesome artists! Sometimes we change teams to bring new insights and experience, but that's where we are right now (and that's why I almost exclusively talk about skins).\n\nAs for Panth, of course, we definitely want to VU him but he's not in the works right now.","replies":[{"poster":"Garentheon","date":"2016-02-15T06:32:22.034+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the reply.

That being said, don't {{champion:120}} AND {{champion:266}}  also represent avatars of War? There's a lot of symbolism in Hecarim's design relating to the horsemen of the apocalypse. And Aatrox`s entire concept is basically built around the idea that he revels in war and conflict. How would Pantheon's design resonate with that ideal without borrowing too heavily from Greek/Roman depictions of Ares or stepping on either of those character's territory? \n\nOn another note, it's no secret that Mt. Targon was ravaged by a long-standing war between the Lunari and Solari. If Pantheon was to represent it, is there a chance his symbol might be the eclipse?","replies":[{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2016-02-15T16:40:48.969+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Personally I like to think {{champion:80}} would represent the mastery of combat through war.  {{champion:120}} represents the first charge of battle, the stampede of warriors coming in to slaughter the enemies.\n\nThink of {{champion:120}} as the tides in the ocean of war.  Now think of {{champion:80}} as a ship captain in this sea.  He has and has mastered every single tool of war, using them to their most effectiveness as he sails through this turbulent ocean.  \n\nAs for design, I like to think of Bellona from Smite (Not outright copying of course):\n\nhttp://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/smite.gamepedia.com/2/2c/T_Bellona_Default_Card.png?version=f5e0e6c14f9b542b6094e9036a4fd612\n\nBellona is basically a war god who changes weapons with her basic abilities.  She is a master of every tool of combat.  Hence an avatar of war should represent their mastery in not only their skill, but their attire.  I think {{champion:80}} would carry extra weapons with him, like actually soldiers (at least a short sword on his side).  \n\nUnlike {{champion:131}} and {{champion:89}}, I imagine his actual armor wouldn't be too regal.  It would have something specific about it so people could identify his position, but it would need to be something that would be sensible to wear in combat.  I don't mean like a king/nobleman's armor that they wear to lead battles from a chariot.  But armor similar to his fellow soldiers.  \n\nHis symbol would probably be the Rakkor symbol, if not the fighter symbol (because what else works?).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Pikmints","date":"2016-02-15T15:47:07.305+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I feel like part of his current \"generic-ness\" is from the traumatic incident that turned his head black and made his eyes glow.
