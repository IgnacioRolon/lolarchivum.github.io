My mouse only scrolls up... scrolling down doesn't work. I can't buy items. When I try to left or right click all it does is ping.  I can't choose skills, I can't do much of anything except ping.  I kind of hit every button on my keyboard and it sometimes works itself out.  Other times I just close and restart the program but it happens a LOT.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-18T21:21:39.254+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm, there may be a background app causing this to happen.
