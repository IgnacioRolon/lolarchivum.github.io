Can't install LoL on new laptop, getting Error 1935 when trying to install.","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been trying to install League of Legends on my new laptop but i keep getting an error (error 1935). I've tried a couple of fixes I read about, including resetting the log through the command prompt, restarting into a clean boot, and trying to install it directly from Microsoft. None of these have fixed my issue. Any help would be appreciated!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-15T00:53:45.442+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since it's a new rig you may be missing products from Windows that require installation.  Make sure to update your Windows to get that fixed up.  You can also download[ Visual C++](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=3387) directly which would cause this error.  I hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
