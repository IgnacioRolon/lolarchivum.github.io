The problem is i forgot my password and i do not have access to the email i on my account. It was a Verizon email but i recently moved so i do not have Verizon anymore which also means no access to the email. Riot support basically won't help me because i don't have things like a pay-pal linked to that email or some old pre paid card pin numbers which i don't have anymore since its been roughly 2 years. I named every champion i owned on that account and many skins i had on that account. I also gave them my ign which is different then my user name since i changed it with rp. I gave the first password i had before i was forced to change to this new one(the one i don't remember). I don't know what else i could do and i really want to play again but i need help. It took me 2 weeks sending emails back and forth with support and it got me no where so i don't know what else to do. Does anyone have any ideas or anyway to help me because i really want to play again.\r\n\r\nPs: I made this account just for a forums post","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-03T02:55:53.731+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unless we're able to verify you're the account owner after being provided with enough info, we can't release an account.
