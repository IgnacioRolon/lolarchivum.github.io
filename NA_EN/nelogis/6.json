Do you hate Riven?","subforum":"General Discussion","up_votes":17,"down_votes":2,"body":"Well then you came to the right place!\n\nAfter long testing and hard work I can proudly present to you, Warwick in the top lane!\n\nNow before you call me a troll let me explain to you why it works\n\n- Warwick has one of the strongest early games out there thanks to his passive. Taking this early power and putting it in top makes it so he can zone out almost any melee from the minions and gain a cs advantage just for existing.\n- One of the best lane sustains. Thanks to his passive again, Warwick can always heal back up to 50% HP just by auto attacking. This makes it so he can sustain poke but also take risky trades which further strengthens his early game\n- Q can CC-Buffer. His Q can buffer a lot of CCs, the only thing he can't buffer are plain and simple stuns/fears/charms. Knock-ups and displacements can be buffered with holding down the Q, mitigating stuff like Darius pull / Sion Q / Riven Q3. Very essential parts of many champs.\n- Battle-healing, not only can Warwick naturally lane sustain, he also heals for a fuckton while fighting. His Q / Passive and ult heal him, especially his ult can heal up to half his entire HP bar. This makes it so even at low HP Warwick can turn the tides of a battle and bait the opponent.\n- Not a popular pick. Since nobody knows what to expect from a Warwick top they make mistakes. They don't expect the healing or the burst mitigation from his E.\n- Once Warwick is ahead he is a monster to deal with. If you ever manage to get a lead not even the jungler will be able to stop you. The only way to defeat you at that point is if the enemy laner has ignite or other means of applying GW. Without GW you heal too much and deal too much damage for the jungler to stop your lead.\n- He is a Hybrid, so enemies have a hard time building against you. Your passive does magic and your Q too, while ult and your autos do physical damage. Your ult also applies 3 on-hit effects so essentially it deals magic damage too.\n- He can evade jungle ganks pretty well. When shit hits the fan he can ult away in the worst case scenario but usually it's okay to just hold down Q to get behind the jungler and E-Fear him away from you. That should get you out of there. In this meta there are a lot of junglers where you cn buffer their cc (Rek / J4 etc.) making it even easier to escape a gank.\n\n\"Woah this sounds absolutely unstoppable!\"\nWell yeah against most melees it is but unfortunately there are some things that fuck this pick over.\n\n- He almost can't do anything against ranged opponents (well apart from the sustain he has). The only gap-closer outside of his ult is to hold down Q on a minion to charge forward a little. What he can do however is to get low on purpose to bait the ranged into engaging into melee range then ult to heal back to half HP. Most of the time though you can out-sustain their poke and just wait until laning phase is over.\n- He is weak against short trades. Stuff like Renekton is a problem for him, Warwick needs extended trades to use his kit to its full potential.\n- GW hurts him a lot. The healing in his kit is a VERY big part of his power-budget. Halving its effect reduces Warwicks power by a lot.\n- He isn't great at taking down towers\n- The active part of W isn't that useful in lane, you can use it to get back to lane faster. The passive part however is good and when an enemy is low you zoom around the lane and it's hard to hit a skillshot on you so there is that. You can roam mid lane very well when the laner is low. Also you can bring the enemy down to 50% hp then back and run back to lane with increased movementspeed.\n\nNow I'm not saying WW top is pickable into anything but there is 1 matchup he absolutely completely annihilates.\nAnd it's Riven.\n\nRiven has such a hard time dealing with Warwick it's actually funny. When she engages on you with her 12 animation cancels you just press E and her damage is reduced by 35%!\nBy the time her combo is finished you still have the fear up and you took almost no damage, you can cc buffer her Q3 and fear her.\nYour healing and ult make it so she has a REALLY hard time executing you with her ult so her R damage is reduced by a lot. The only way she can somewhat deal with you is when she takes ignite.\n\nWarwick does exactly what Riven hates, she goes for the short trade, deals less damage and wants to get out by cc'ing you and dashing away but it doesn't work. WW just says \"fuck you\" to all of that.\n\nSo when should you pick WW top?\n\nYou can pick him into almost any melee but Renekton / Darius / Olaf are risky and it basically becomes a kill or get killed lane. True damage generally is good against WW since his E doesn't block that type of damage (He fucks over Camille though don't be scared of Camille)\n\nHe is pickeable into ranged thx to his sutain but you don't have any kill pressure. So essentially you can't use WWs early game and with that it's a suboptimal pick.\n\nHe does okay into tanks since he has %max HP damage and hybrid damage but tanks just rush bramble and that hurts WW a lot.\n\nYou shouldn't pick WW top into a Udyr Jungle. Sounds random but you can't do much against Udyr that is the thing. If he choses to camp you, you are going to die.... a lot.\n\nIt is better to pick him into AD matchups (more to that later). Best thing is when the top and the jungler are both AD.\n\nThe absolutely BEST place to pick Warwick is into weak early AD matchups while the enemy jungler is a Kayn or something (also weak early AD). They just cannot do anything about you.\n\nWhen it comes to the runes you should go PTA as the keystone. Trumph / Legend Alacrity / Last stand for the runes. Last stand is really good since it amps up your healing even more when you are low.\nAs secondary I either go Resolve into harder matchups (bone plating or second wind + Revitalize) and Inspiration into easy matchups (Magical Footwear + Cosmic insight)\n\nPTA strengthens your early pressure even more and in the late game when WW falls off he can provide dmg amp for his team with PTA.\n\nWhen it comes to items the 2 core things you need is a Tiamat and a Sheen.\nYou rush Tiamat into Sheen, then build IBG (that is why he is good into AD) then finish Titanic Hydra. After that you get what you need you just go full Tank. Against a Vayne you can also go Steraks for the extra shield.\nKeep in mind Tiamat + Sheen enhances your early power by a lot\n\nWhen you face an AP matchup you should go Tiamat into Sheen into Spirit Visage and then finish the IBG and Hydra. Problem this way don't have damage for a long time.\n\nTrading pattern in the early game is pretty simple, at lvl 1 you auto, (hold down if you want to keep fighting) Q, auto for the PTA proc.\n\nOnce E is leveled up you do the same crap but after PTA is triggered you activate the fear and auto once or twice then get out.\n\nA full combo with Hydra mostly involves a lot of auto resets, Auto - Q - Auto - Hydra - Auto - Fear - Auto - R - Auto - Q\nMostly how a normal auto attack bruiser does it.\n\nFor Summoners you go Ignite / Flash, forget TP.\n\nEdit: Totally forgot the stat buffs and starter items!\nFor stat shard you want the attack speed and the HP. The last one is situational, into easier matchups you go damage into hard ones you go defence.\n\nWhen it comes to starting items I mostly go D-Shield or D-Blade. D-Shield into anything that can poke, D-Blade into pure melee matchups (stuff like Tryndamere or Jax).\n\nYou can also go D-Ring if you are concerned about mana issues. It depends on the playstyle if you want to use your Q as a poking/tradning tool then you will run oom quickly. I myself use Q to repostion myself to auto attack more. This way I only use the ability to gap close.\n\nOn paper the D-Ring does more or less the same what the D-Shield does. It gives you more healing (you can use Q on minions with the ring). Also your Q damage gets increased with the ring so there is that\n\nAnd that is basically it! Keep in mind Warwick gets scarier the less HP he has, so when it looks like you are losing just remember your balls of steel and commit fully to the fight. You will be surprised how hard Warwick can clutch at low HP.\n\nAlso as a side note, his W is bugged when you freshly spawn into the map, any enemy under 50% DOESN'T get marked as long as they don't get damaged. As soon as they take even a caster minion auto attack the mark triggers. It's annoying but yeah....\n\nHappy hunting!","replies":[]}
