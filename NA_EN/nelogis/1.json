You also weren't able to just level Silver Bolts up before the Q-Buff since then you dealt a lot of damage yes but you were sitting there like a wannabe Kog'Maw with short range. Your Q cooldown was just too high to survive.\r\n\r\nWhat I propose is to switch Silver Bolts with her Passive, it would look like this:\r\n\r\n**Passive: Silver Bolts**\r\n\r\nVayne's basic attacks and Condemn apply a Silver Bolts stack for 3.5 seconds, up to 3 times. Attacking a new enemy removes all stacks from the previous target.\r\nThe third stack consumes them all to deal 4% - 14% (based on level) max HP bonus true damage and capped at 200 against monsters.\r\n\r\n**W: Night Hunter**\r\nCost: 20 Mana\r\nCooldown: 16/14/12/10/8 (starts when the ability is completely finished)\r\n\r\nVayne gains 20 movementspeed for 8 seconds, this effect is tripled when walking towards enemy champions and quadrupled during **Final Hour** (also only when walking towards enemy champions)\r\n\r\nThis change will make it so her DPS once again comes online way later into the game compared to now, however she will also have new ways to survive the early game to get to that state and also have a certain \"downtime\" the enemy can capitalize on thus also increasing her counterplay (which is badly needed).\r\n\r\nYou can compare this change to Tristana, her efficiency is also heavily tied to levels (her passive)","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-04-15T09:23:32.377+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":24,"body":"You think that delaying her damage steroid by more than double, significantly reducing the uptime on her movespeed boost, and increasing her mana costs to boot wouldn't delete her from the game?","replies":[{"poster":"PedobearTheBeast","date":"2019-04-15T10:24:42.811+0000","up_votes":22,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=KFCeytron,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=fM3dmZJG,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2019-04-15T09:23:32.377+0000)\n>\n> You think that delaying her damage steroid by more than double, significantly reducing the uptime on her movespeed boost, and increasing her mana costs to boot wouldn't delete her from the game?\nYou think that the rate at which she acquires her damage steroid is healthy?\n\nMfw someone thinks an S+ tier champ is going to get deleted, because they can't abuse her op abilities anymore.\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}}","replies":[{"poster":"Sewer Side","date":"2019-04-15T11:10:47.673+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":13,"body":"She’s barely S tier and even reverting her buffs or changing the macro game will easily drop her to B- tier.\n\nBesides, you know who’s next once Vayne gets nerfed?

Fiora is one of the worst top laners so I don’t think you need to worry about her lol. I have been spamming her for a week or two and honestly I don’t normally notice the damage of her vitals, Fiora specifically is only strong when tanks are mediocre/strong. When the champs that she is designed to counter are nerfed to the ground then she isn’t going to be that strong either.\n\nI think that we should still keep the % max hp true damage in, but I think that in this meta we should keep them below 10% or even 5%. I think fiora’s should be higher than vayne’s, but that is because Fiora has a harder time accessing the true damage (vitals) while vayne’s true damage only requires her to auto attack. I’m thinking Vayne: 2%-4% and Fiora: 4%-10%.","replies":[{"poster":"Ragnaveil","date":"2019-04-15T19:45:46.523+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"But the general issue is that this mechanic has no counterplay. Its the specific reason why all of Fiora's damage is on a minigame (and Hash said it best, she's shit because of all the disgusting shit on her kit. Buffs only make the issue worse (i.e. make everyone in top hate fighting her, then she gets nerfed, then becomes shit, rinse repeat). She should go back to a simpler passive that gives her a duelist advantage and not some stupid minigame (and R could be made different).\n\nAnd the reason why people want to cling to such damage is because people think the tank meta was the fault of tanks being too good. Guess people forgot ADCs being so good spurred that meta of protect the adc because they are all that matters (which got worse when enchanter items went overboard at worlds, creating the \"fun\" Ardent meta).","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Abibyama II","date":"2019-04-15T11:07:55.067+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"That's what they want lol","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Bârd","date":"2019-04-15T21:25:59.693+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"The idea of making Silver Bolts scale solely with levels is pretty OK.\n\nNot a fan of making Night Hunter an active, though.
