And since I have a good mood today, I will also be designing a champion along side with you to have the best learning experience on the whole boards!\n\nFirst before actually thinking of any abilities you have to make some hard decisions.\nFor example you have to not only decide what role your champion should cover from the beginning but also what his design is. Keep in mind that it is a huge commitment in champion ability design to first chose the champion aesthetics. While doing so you have to absolutely consider that even the champion aesthetics and the abilitiy design yet to be born from it are not only fun to play as but also against.\n\nLuckily we are designing a CertainlyT champion so you can completely ignore all above mentioned points and get right into the fun part! Wooohoo!\n\nThe passive: Now here is what other champion designers do wrong when it comes to CertainlyT champions, they try to make the passive have an impact on the rest of the kit and therefore design this ability right of the bat. \nWe are going to skip the passive for now and I will tell you why later on!\n\nThe Q spell: Ahh the bread and butter of any CertainlyT champion! With bread and butter I of course mean that you have to give your opponent the feeling that this ability somehow has a lower cooldown than Karthus Q while being one of the highest impact spells in your kit.\nThe next quintessentail thing is that this ability has to give the illusion of counterplay. What I mean is that it only has to LOOK like it can be counterplayed but doesn&#039;t actually have to be interactive, whether its counterplay aspects are hidden through the rest of the kit or the ability is only theoratically counterable is up to you. The second way is rather easier.\n\nIn the meantime I have decided to design an ADC! And the Q spell goes as follows:\nCharge a powerful shot and enhance your next auto attack which can be blocked by minions.\n\nW and E: These are the spells that make CertainlyT champions, CertainlyT champions. The absolute most important thing to keep in mind is that at least one (preferably both) abilities piss a lot of people off.\nNow pissing people off is a piece of cake nowadays. I find Akali a fun champion to play against and boom, 20 downvotes as easy as that.\nBut to truly become the next CertainlyT you have to get this to the next level. You have to make these abilities so abnormaly ~~toxic~~ _interactive_ that even your own team gets pissed off because of it. The best and easiest way to approach this is to add RNG elements into those abilities.\nAlso, alltough this is already clear I guess but I thought I would just point it out anyway, the abilities, if your champion has any resources, can be spammed off cooldown without ever running OOM.\n\nFor my champion I thought of this:\nE: Passive ability: Your auto attacks have a 5% chance to insta kill enemies, additionally your Q now can go through minions.\nW: Upon activation your auto attacks knock back people (5 seconds uptime 5.1 seconds cooldown)\n\nThe ultimate spell: Now I know what you are thinking &quot;dude this spell must be the most interactive thing in his kit!&quot;.\nActually no, surprisingly enough the R spell is a spell only to ENHANCE the other abilities but not a spell on its own. Let me elaborate.\n\nMy champions R spell goes as follows:\nAfter succesfully hitting someone with your interactive Q spell they get marked. You can ult marked targets and fire an exceptionally powerful shot that deals 40% max Hp true damage!\n\nAs you can see the ultimate has no counterplay on its own but rather works off the counterplayability of another spell. If you couldn&#039;t stop the Q you automatically can&#039;t stop the R. \n\nYour champion is almost done! Now we get back to the passive! Remember? The one we left out earlier. The reason why we do it now is to make sure the passive has absolutely nothing to do with the rest of the kit. If you designed the passive from the beginning you would be clouded with ideas on how to implement it in the rest of the kit in a unique way, we don&#039;t want that.\n\nThe passive or passives, yes you heard it right, as the designer of a CertainlyT champion you have the unique privilege of adding numerous passives! Whatever they may be they need to have the following in common: \nThey have to be as generic as possible and be put somewhere where it can&#039;t be interacted with (for example auto attacks), additionally they have to be buffs to stats or a utility spell that can be activated with the least amount of effort imaginable (again, auto attacks). It isn&#039;t needed to hide these spells behind a counterplay mask but if you can, go for it. That gives the fanbase another way to defend the champion design.\n\nMy champions passive would go like this:\nYou have longer AA range towards targets with greater health than you.\nClearly the counterplay here is to not buy health and go IE on Maokai.\n\nOnly one step left! As a true CertainlyT designer you have not wasted a single thought to the lore of your champion, good job!\nThe most elegant way to write a lore is to just follow the newest lore meta in league, which is balantly overpowered characters that shouldn&#039;t be in league in the first place. Let me show you an example:\n\nAdd&#039;Car is a voidborn, aspect of targon demigod that fights an eternal war. He has a gay Darkin trapped inside of him named Aanuz and a human (also gay) named Frederic Ister that tries to kill the Darkin. When Frederic Ister destroys Aanuz, Add&#039;Car will get his old powers back and rule over Runeterra!\n\nOr something like that, the lore of a CertainlyT champion isn&#039;t important anyway\n\nTadaaa your champion is done! Post your design in the comments to show everyone how good of a CertainlyT you truly are!\n\nPlease don&#039;t leave any junk here while you go! Yes I&#039;m talking to you Dave!\n\nI wish everyone a nice and interactive day!\n\n\n\n\n\n\ny...you can leave now....\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo I mean it, seriously fuck off","replies":[{"poster":"rework trundle","date":"2018-01-31T13:49:06.751+0000","up_votes":74,"down_votes":1,"body":"Forget playtesting, release this already.","replies":[{"poster":"Velzard of Koz","date":"2018-01-31T18:52:42.984+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"Live servers, Board feedback and the measurement of salt generated is the best form of playtesting any champion.\nAlso easiest to ignore so that you don't actually have to do anything off the tests.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Thilmer","date":"2018-01-31T15:07:46.568+0000","up_votes":45,"down_votes":0,"body":"You forget that the character should have at least four passives and his passive must be at least two passives.","replies":[{"poster":"nelogis","date":"2018-01-31T16:32:56.149+0000","up_votes":20,"down_votes":0,"body":"how could I have forgotten such an important advice!\n\nI thank you good Sir for bringing it up, you may now have the privilege to eat snacks (still exluding tide pods) during the show","replies":[]},{"poster":"Uranium","date":"2018-01-31T19:13:02.446+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{champion:202}} {{champion:202}} {{champion:202}} {{champion:202}} ","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Abibyama","date":"2018-01-31T16:55:42.454+0000","up_votes":35,"down_votes":0,"body":"CertainlyT after seeing the post\nhttps://i.imgur.com/ezNuiJa.jpg","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shukr4n","date":"2018-01-31T13:47:28.097+0000","up_votes":20,"down_votes":0,"body":"hi\n\njust to share a comment about CertainT on EU forum, i created a champ in 2 minutes, not using anyway your tecnique, so apologies for incoherency.\n\ni share here\n\n> stealth on movement after level 6, doesnt break while attacking.\n> every % crit raise attack damage stat by same\n> a 2 seconds stun skillshot\n> some aoe bullshit\n> \n> R champion divide in 3 last 30s and all 3 copies attack your target with your same attack damage, crit and AS\n\ni didnt check which skill is which neither the passive.\nis too much interactive?","replies":[{"poster":"nelogis","date":"2018-01-31T14:21:26.273+0000","up_votes":29,"down_votes":1,"body":"not bad, not bad at all\n\nyou should make the skillshot homing while you are stealthed so people can say \"just get oracles from Klepto LUL\" to counterplay it\n\nespecially the skill \"Some AOE bullshit\" is very intriguing\n\nbut here is your mistake, the R is a skill innen of itself, make the R a passive (btw im hoping that the 2 other clones are also stealthed) and add a new R something like\n\nWhen you succesfully and skillfully hit your stun you can cast R which stuns for the duration your normal stun is on cooldown (not affected by tenacity)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ayanami3rd","date":"2018-01-31T15:20:17.617+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":1,"body":"Psyladin, the Mindtwister\n\n* P = \"Foul Stench\".

Attacking an enemy champion with this ability grants you 0.5% of their maximum health as bonus health permanently.\n\n\n**[Q] **\n**Active**: (channeled skillshot) Channel for 2 seconds and release a powerful magic nova in one direction that deals 80/120/160/200/240 + 0.6 AP magic damage that is increased by 15/20/25/30/35% (no cap) per unit it hits. \nCooldown: 10; costs: 60/61/62/63/64 Mana; range: 2000\n*Note: Similar to Thresh, the champion model face direction does not update upon casting. *\n\n\n**[W] **\n**Active**: (self cast) Reflect all enemy CC that is dealt to you are allies within 650 range for 4 seconds to attacker. You also become immune to ally CC effects like (e.g. Bard R, Kalista R, Tahm Kench W) which means you can still attack enemies but can't be attacked because your health bar is effected by the ally untargetability. \nCooldown: 16/14/12/10/8 after effect ends; costs: none\n\n\n**[E] **\n**Active**: (AoE) Places an invisible trap on the ground that activates 0,75 seconds after enemies entered it. Every enemy that is hit by the trap will be marked for 2 seconds. After 2 seconds, the mark expires, dealing 100/160/220/280/340 + 0.4 AP magic damage over 2 seconds and causes enemy champions and pets to lose control over their movement while running around in random pathes for the duration. \n\n\n\n**[R]**\n**Passive**: Every 60-30 seconds (scaling down with level) you gain true sight of a randomly selected enemy champion for 5 seconds. Gaining true sight of an enemy while they are camouflaged, stealthed or standing in a brush refunds 80% of the cooldown and grants 5/8/12 gold per second. \n**Active**: (point'n'click) Designate an enemy champion to swap places within a range if you have sight on them. This is not blocked by spellshields or black shields.\nCooldown: 30/25/20; costs: 100/50/0 Mana; range 4000\n\n**[Lore]**\nGeneral Clownus Fiestus was a grand master of trickery in the wars between Runeterra and the void and shut down most void gates himself. Thousands of Void swarms died to his greatness and power before he became a god himself that created entities that were able to create whole galaxies. \n\n**[Analysis]**\n[P] is a window of power for GCF where his opponent has to play around his bonus attack range. Also his passive becomes irrelevant as long as his enemy dodges his abilities. \n[Q] is a very telegraphed, long channeled ability that can be easily interrupted by any hard CC. It is also not dealing that much damage if you are hit first so if you (as a tank) don't want your backline to be damaged that much you just don't try to block the projectile. Also it is not global so it's uncapped damage is basically capped. And it's a skilshot so you can dodge it. \n[W]You just have to hard CC him BEFORE he casts W! And you can also play around his 4 second duration. Fake an engage so he has to cast W and then attack him after the 4 seconds. \n[E] The trap doesn't slow you in the first place so it's easy to walk out of it. \n[R] If you walk around as team it makes GCF jump into your groupt and die. Easy as it is. And it deals no damage so it's shit in bronze.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DeadUnborn","date":"2018-01-31T16:42:30.098+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":0,"body":"this was somehow brilliant XD\n\nYou cracked me up with Aanuz","replies":[{"poster":"nelogis","date":"2018-01-31T16:47:02.324+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"just wait until F.Ister destroys him","replies":[{"poster":"Velzard of Koz","date":"2018-01-31T18:54:31.708+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"He may be stopped by his nemesis Clii Toriz, though.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Akali Prime","date":"2018-01-31T20:17:39.314+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=DeadUnborn,realm=NA,application-id=Ir7ZrJjF,discussion-id=I9Botjlv,comment-id=0006,timestamp=2018-01-31T16:42:30.098+0000)\n>\n> this was somehow brilliant XD\n> \n> You cracked me up with Aanuz\n\nooooh i get it now.. {{sticker:sg-miss-fortune}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"leagueofturds","date":"2018-01-31T19:24:30.763+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":0,"body":"Champ: CertainlyT\nRole: Fill\nPassive: Ignores player feedback.
