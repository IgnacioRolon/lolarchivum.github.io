It is almost as if Pyke is a leveled up version of Ekko, even using similar abilities. Pyke also recoveres health, also dashes forward leaving a ghost behind and also has blinks and stuns, not to mention the teal glow their abilities share as well. I fully get that their playstyles will probably be different, but from the model design standpoint, this is almost a rework. \nThis is how you end up with theories how Pyke is actually Ekko, who died, then his time-back activated accidentaly post mortem, resulting in him getting horrified and turning psycho because of the experience.","replies":[{"poster":"Crimson Anam","date":"2018-05-15T09:12:10.809+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"How is this Ekko?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kelg","date":"2018-05-15T09:10:00.051+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did you mean to put this in Memes & Games?\n{{sticker:sg-miss-fortune}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Digielf","date":"2018-05-15T10:27:12.004+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"it looks like adult Ekko","replies":[]},{"poster":"Norksmeine","date":"2018-05-15T13:27:12.146+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://lolstatic-a.akamaihd.net/frontpage/apps/prod/rg-champion-reveal-pyke-bloodharbor-ripper/en_US/4cc51c48fc4e185fb5409def2b3649a84b0d4339/assets/img/content/wallpaper/sandwraith-splash.jpg\nLook.
