The next punishment after a 14 day ban is a permanent ban.\n\nThe rules of chat basically allow no negativity. You cant argue with people. You cant call for reports against someone, as 1 report has the same effect as 9. You cant insult anyone (Implied someone is an idiot, called them racist, called them rude). I know you had reasons for all this, you dont just go around accusing people for no reason. But, according to Riot's rules, it is never justified to argue with people or insult them. They expect you to mute when you have a problem with someone's chat. Instead of muting, you brought shit to all chat and argued and complained in all of your chat. Literally all of it is either arguing or complaining. So next time, if you do make a new account, you should just mute, report if you want, and move on. Theres no reason to take that abuse when muting stops it all.\n\nIf I were you, I would attempt to get the punishment lowered by filing a support ticket. Ask for a second look, as your chat isnt offensive, its just excessive arguing and derailing focus from the game.

Its not okay for them to do it, and its not okay to join in and exacerbate the situation when someone else does it. What gives you the idea its okay?

You're permabanned for _one more_ game with inappropriate chat, after having been warned about it before.

The chat feature is intended as a means to foster teamwork and encourage communication so you and your teammates can coordinate your gameplay and win games. It is not intended as a platform for you to scream at people and harass them, which is what you used it for.\n\nAlso:\n\n0. Everyone else's behavior isn't in question here. Only yours is.\n0. You did engage in bannable behavior. See my quoted post above.\n0. The only available self-defense from being harassed in chat is to mute the offending player. It is 100% effective. Calling for reports, useless arguing, etc. are 0% effective on top of being misbehavior that Riot punishes.","replies":[{"poster":"Caramél Kitty","date":"2019-07-10T05:14:17.464+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":11,"body":"It's clear that this company supports cyber bullying and care more about banning people for trying to get said cyber bullies punished for their behavior versus the one being harassed.","replies":[{"poster":"rujitra","date":"2019-07-10T05:23:56.752+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"You will never get punished for reporting, which is how you try to get bullies punished.\n\nThe things you did in this log did absolutely nothing to help get others punished for bullying.
