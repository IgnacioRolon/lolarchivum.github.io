I&#039;d much have preferred that they reuse the owl sounds from her other abilities for the new ult sound. As it is the ult sound doesn&#039;t support the theme of the skin, and with that cooldown you&#039;re going to be hearing it a lot.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-11-13T21:49:02.890+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Risotadazo! \n\nNice catch!

And not all owls hoot much either.","replies":[{"poster":"Risotadazo","date":"2015-11-13T22:26:06.906+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"So for realism we should make the skin silent when fighting Twitch, yordles etc.?","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Scindo","date":"2015-11-22T00:50:07.185+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes please!
