I felt that the new sound for Quinn&#039;s ultimate didn&#039;t fit with a skin which had quite different owl sounds on its other abilities. Since you hear the ult sound a lot when you play Quinn, and I prefer the hooting sounds to the default screeching ones, I asked if they could possibly reuse some of their existing sounds on the skin to make the ult sound fit better into the skins theme.\n\nAt the time the post got a moderately positive response from the boards, and even got multiple responses from Riot KateyKhaos saying \n> [{quoted}](name=Riot KateyKhaos,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=EjMtPEVg,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2015-11-13T21:49:02.890+0000)\n>\n> Hey Risotadazo! \n> \n> Nice catch!

Before the marksmen update Quinn had unique sound effects on both her Phoenix skin and Woad Scout Quinn skin whenever she would cast Skystrike. Is there any chance we can get these sounds back in for that ability? Skystrike is just using the same sound effects from her base skin across all her skins currently rather than the unique ones they had before.\n\nIn case you're wondering, here's video footage of what I mean:\n\nhttp://youtu.be/rRg6CG0TxkY\nPhoenix Quinn had sharp, fiery sound effects attached to Skystrike.

I am glad they updated the sound for the new ult though, rather than leaving Valor with eagle cries in that skin. And if they went through the trouble of finding new SFX for owl Valor then I doubt they'd just do away with 'em.\n\nHopefully they'll add the hooting sounds back to Skystrike for Woad Scout Quinn though, and maybe they'll update Phoenix Quinn's Behind Enemy Lines  SFX too since it is a 975 RP skin with a phoenix rather than an eagle. Not to mention, Phoenix Quinn also mysteriously lost its unique Skystrike sound effect after the update.","replies":[]}]}
