We have a bit more lax rules than boards  however we are still different from them, but if you are looking into a new experience in gd I recommend trying this place out! It's not a ghost town either, many people has been using this site since 5 months ago since we started and it seems we grow bigger and bigger every day.  For interface, there is a lot of changeable themes within the options, so you don't have to stick to just one and there are ways to disable signatures if that isn't your type of thing, or put one yourself. There is also pming so you can say something to a fellow forum goer without actually having to message them on client and junk.  Even though our rules are moderately lax, it doesn't mean we have no rules.  I encourage you to read the rules thread before posting.   Here is a handful of our themes we have: \n http://puu.sh/hexva/7fd496c253.jpg (Steam store created by Lith)\n http://puu.sh/hexuc/ecff09264b.jpg (Nami created by Kythers)\n http://puu.sh/hexsO/55e061753d.jpg (Mudkip created by Lily)\nhttp://puu.sh/hexs7/59087fd318.jpg (Boards created by ICK) \n http://puu.sh/hexqz/06b875cbc4.jpg  (Reisen created by Phyrex)\nhttp://i.imgur.com/Ndl09Yt.png (Vegeta created by Annihilation)\nhttp://puu.sh/heyWA/73005de3fe.jpg (Kongou created by shinytoast) \nhttp://puu.sh/heDB7.jpg (Furi Kuri created by unknown)\nAnd a lot more. Some even have unique icons, so I suggest trying out a lot of them! There is also many giveaways by some users too that isn't just for league, but for other games.  Although admittedly we do not talk about league a majority of the time, we all love games/movies/anime(okay not all :^) )/etc.. so come stop by! http://genericdiscussion.freeforums.net/board/1/general-board) ","replies":[]}
