It is possibly a replay bug but the hook thrown by the Thresh in the video I&#039;m providing makes me think the vision was there in game too, not just in replay.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CI6h-GlpcdM\r\n\r\nVideo timestamped to relevant time, but earlier in the video shows we had in fact destroyed the tower, it isn&#039;t just invisible in the replay. Note that in the replay the timeline at the bottom also does not register the tower dying. No clue how to recreate it or what caused it.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Wittrock","date":"2019-02-01T00:19:35.447+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the report!
