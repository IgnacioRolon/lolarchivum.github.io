Rules apply to all queues but you cant queue up as 4 in any ranked queue. Its either all or 3, So that isnt fair to the 4 playing either to say this just toxic behavior. Otherwise id ask how is this toxic behavior and pointt me to a \"rule\" that is against this behavior.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"rujitra","date":"2019-02-21T03:56:40.609+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Put a slash in front of the number sign and it'll appear right :) \\#","replies":[{"poster":"Light Burner","date":"2019-02-21T04:00:41.383+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=rujitra,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=IgRn3xtM,comment-id=00030000,timestamp=2019-02-21T03:56:40.609+0000)\n>\n> Put a slash in front of the number sign and it'll appear right :) \\#\n\nty ty","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"zPOOPz","date":"2019-02-21T03:43:33.474+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"how many times have you actually encounter this?

Yes they told me they were premade, which is in the chat logs.  \"Its just a normal\" is a terrible reason to downplay this incredibly toxic behavior.","replies":[{"poster":"zPOOPz","date":"2019-02-21T03:47:18.677+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Then report them and move on.
