I texted my friend and asked him to invite me to see if that would work. I was given an error message when I tried joining. Tried inviting him he was given the same error message I got when I tried joining his lobby. Tried changing the lobby type, was given an error message. I can still play the game but I can't play with friends.","replies":[{"poster":"Ryguy95","date":"2017-11-21T05:10:10.552+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm having this same issue.
