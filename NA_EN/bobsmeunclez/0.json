But the second I go into any form of PVP, I go against the noobiest people in the world, who smurf just to win and basically completely ruin the game for new people like me. Not only do I face smurfs, I constantly get called a noob and that I should uninstall the game by my &quot;teammates&quot;, even though I try to explain I am new to it all and am here to learn to play against people, as bots has become seriously easy. Not only do Smurfs slaughter me, then they either completely deny they are smurfs, or they start doing the bullshit of &quot;rekt&quot; and &quot;cya&quot; and other pathetic things. Now I understand not all are smurfs, but I know when some are as they can 4v1 you with ease and have almost perfect CS, if not more than double your CS in the first 10 minutes, and be able to completely push you in lane.\r\n\r\nI can&#039;t handle this game anymore, it&#039;s just full of toxic people who have been playing years, and expect new people like me to be pro at it from the get go. I don&#039;t enjoy any of the games I play, due to being brought down by everyone in the game. So what&#039;s the point in me playing if I am not enjoying it at all.","replies":[{"poster":"RQ Amiable","date":"2017-01-08T22:27:43.719+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i mean.. im but a simple gold pleb. but if you wanna play with me you can.","replies":[{"poster":"BobsMeUnclez","date":"2017-01-08T22:29:47.221+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The only thing is, I'm in EUW, so I'd have to make an account in NA wouldn't I?","replies":[{"poster":"RQ Amiable","date":"2017-01-08T22:31:55.560+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yes you would ;c","replies":[{"poster":"BobsMeUnclez","date":"2017-01-08T22:55:41.153+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Created an NA account, it's username is BeamerSteamer, couldn't think of anything lmao","replies":[]},{"poster":"BobsMeUnclez","date":"2017-01-08T22:36:30.610+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But if I played with you, you do realise it'll be losses for days XD.

Toxic players against AI's :-/.. I've never had anyone be toxic to me in a bot game, it's always a bunch of us messing around due to how easy bots are. But I got \"I'm a noob\" and \"I'm majorly carrying you\" because they had more kills than me (Most they stole off of me lmao). And they didn't like it when I pointed out I had double their CS, so they should be ashamed as I am a completely new player XD. Never thought I would see the day where toxic players also played against AI's and acted so good. They had 4 deaths as well to my 0, but they insisted they were better than me, called me every name under the sun, then said they were reporting me for \"being toxic and taking kills\". Is this what I have too look forward too within the NA community :P\n\nEdit: I'll reply to this with my account if anyone wants too add it lmao.\n\nEdit: Won't let me comment as I am only level 4.

It is easily the hardest role that requires the most team cooperation, knowledge and planning, understanding of champion strengths, ect.\nTop lane is the closest to jungle in terms of champion spillover and mechanics, but without the high level of strategic complexity. I suggest you wait until you are more experienced to play jungle in pvp. Practice in custom bot games until you understand what clear rotations and jungle camps different champions can handle.\n\nRaptors are evil.\n\nDraft will be a lot less toxic and not have as many smurfs and bots. People just play blinds to stop or troll.\n\nIf you want, i could help you level, i have nothing better to do today (ie anything constructive).","replies":[]}]}]}]}
