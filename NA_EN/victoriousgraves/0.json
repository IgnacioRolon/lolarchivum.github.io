There's a texture change for his passive, but it's not being applied properly when the passive activates after killing a minion. We're aware of the issue and are working to resolve it. ^-^ \n\nIn the future, please report issues occurring on the PBE on the [PBE Report a Bug](http://pbr.pbe.leagueoflegends.com/pbe/en_BE/bugReport/create) section.
