I searched through the riot support page and tried everything there, but nothing helped to fix my problem. I really need some help since this lag is killing my league experience.","replies":[{"poster":"HeyItzSteve","date":"2017-03-05T18:39:24.316+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your lag, is it due to your ping being high, or your FPS being low?\n\nIf your FPS is low in League games, there's not much you can do unless you get a new computer. You can try opening Task Manager and end tasks that are using up your CPU.\n\nIf your ping is high, there are many things you can try doing, switch to an Ethernet cable (which I know is hard if your router is not close enough for a cable), making sure that you or others using the same connection aren't using up the bandwidth by streaming videos or downloads, or contact your ISP/change your router.","replies":[{"poster":"Doozku","date":"2017-03-05T22:13:37.262+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its lag, not my fps I know that for sure.\n\nMy internet is the most frustrating thing ever and what makes it worse is that I have no idea what causes it or why it does what it does. Usually I have like 3 people streaming video maybe more but usually 3. My router has such strange behaviour, and it basically tricks me into thinking its working fine, and then doesn't work at all. \n\n1. When I disconnect from my wifi, I cannot reconnect at all unless I restart my router.\n2. Randomly the speed of my internet goes down massively for all devices, to the point where I can't even watch a youtube video without it buffering every 30 seconds.\n3. When the Wifi is working fine, I'll go into a league game and enjoy 60 ping for 5 minutes before it starts spiking, disconnecting me, and making it so I simply can't even move at all. And then when the game ends, my ping goes back down to 60.\n4. I can't change it to a wired network, because I play on my laptop which is in a room next door to the router\n5. When I ping my router, I get 1-5 ms with a rare spikes going up to 15, which I think is normal.\n6. I've tried every possible fix on the internet, and nothing works. I don't think its interference, because it used to work perfectly before, and it still works fine every once in a blue moon. I've disabled my firewall, changed my DNS, anything at all that should help but nothing even lowers my ping by one.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-03-06T00:21:45.668+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you experience any of these issues if nobody else is using your network while you play League? If so, then I'd like you to run a traceroute log using [**WinMTR**](http://winmtr.net/) so we can determine if there are any issues within your network routing. After loading up the application, you simply need to plug **104.160.131.1** into the host field before starting the trace. After 5 minutes has gone by, you can export the results as text and paste them in a reply to me.\n\nLet me know if you have any issues completing this.","replies":[{"poster":"Doozku","date":"2017-03-06T00:54:39.495+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"OK, here it is then.\n\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n\n|                                      WinMTR statistics                                   |\n\n|                       Host              -   %  | Sent | Recv | Best | Avrg | Wrst | Last |\n\n|------------------------------------------------|------|------|------|------|------|------|\n\n|                             192.168.0.1 -    0 |  365 |  365 |    1 |    4 |  221 |    2 |\n\n|            ftmy-dsl-gw15.ftmy.qwest.net -    0 |  365 |  365 |   19 |   23 |  248 |   20 |\n\n|                ftmy-agw1.inet.qwest.net -    0 |  365 |  365 |   49 |   93 |  483 |  102 |\n\n|              atx-edge-05.inet.qwest.net -    1 |  357 |  355 |   64 |  107 |  464 |  117 |\n\n|                            65.124.97.62 -    0 |  365 |  365 |   64 |  106 |  503 |  120 |\n\n|                          104.160.135.35 -    0 |  365 |  365 |   63 |  106 |  521 |  120 |\n\n|          ae32-br02.chi01.riotdirect.net -    0 |  365 |  365 |   77 |  119 |  519 |  132 |\n\n|           ae1-br01.chi01.riotdirect.net -    0 |  365 |  365 |   77 |  119 |  468 |  132 |\n\n|                           104.160.131.1 -    0 |  365 |  365 |   78 |  119 |  483 |  133 |\n\n|________________________________________________|______|______|______|______|______|______|\n\n   WinMTR v0.92 GPL V2 by Appnor MSP - Fully Managed Hosting & Cloud Provider","replies":[{"poster":"Doozku","date":"2017-03-07T01:53:38.158+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Please help, the problem just keeps getting worse.
