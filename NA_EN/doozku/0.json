I used to always get around 50 ping but now in a game it is constantly lag spiking. Occasionally, the lag goes up to 1000 and stays there for a good 5 minutes. Infact, I was testing in a custom game, and the ping went as far as 10,000 ms! There's nothing on my pc that would cause this constant lag spiking, there's nothing downloading when I play.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-12T23:10:04.151+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just to ensure your local network settings are in fact in a good configuration and not conflicting with League, I recommend working through our [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) real quick.
