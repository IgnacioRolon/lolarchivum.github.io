If you think Ashe isn&#039;t viable right now in anything below Diamond 1, then you probably just don&#039;t understand the game that well.  Given that, why do you suddenly think that you will be able to play well with the reworked version?  Why do you just look at one or two abilities in isolation and say &quot;that new q looks fun - it&#039;s going to be so great to use that&quot;, without realizing that you have to look at the kit as a whole in the context of how you can use it to win a game?\r\n\r\nDo you think her win rate is going to go up post-rework?  If it did, her rework would almost certainly be dubbed OP and adjusted downward.  I just don&#039;t see any way that she maintains the third highest ADC win rate post rework.  Does anyone actually think she will?  Or that that is a more likely outcome than a Trist level drop into solo queue obscurity?","replies":[{"poster":"The5lacker","date":"2015-04-29T20:06:16.181+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"She's boring to play, lacks interaction, and her central play-pattern is all about sitting back, _waiting_ for Focus stacks, then poking the enemy...once.\n\nAshe Rework promotes actually, you know, plaing the game. With people. It's not a viability thing. Win rates are not, have never been, and will never be the reason behind reworks: _Play patterns are._","replies":[]},{"poster":"SmokingPuffin","date":"2015-04-29T20:27:00.812+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I expect to enjoy playing New Ashe a lot more than Old Ashe because her early game won't be so insufferably dull now.  Q is a whole new button for trades and W's cooldown decrease will be quite valuable.\n\nI think Ashe's win rate will decline as a result of the rework.  The current state with Ashe is that you mostly see Ashe mains playing her.  With the addition of mechanics that make her more fun, I'd expect her to be picked up by more people and thus to see more positioning mistakes, bad arrows, etc in the average Ashe game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Reikken","date":"2015-04-29T20:26:17.908+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"I love Ashe now. Her passive is just awkward. And honestly, while I do like the rework, I don't really like her new Q all that much. It's flashy and all, but it doesn't add much utility. I like Ashe because of her utility. An attack speed buff is just more damage. I'll probably max it last, depending on what the cooldown numbers on hawkshot look like.","replies":[{"poster":"The5lacker","date":"2015-04-29T20:28:46.550+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You do realize they're functionally replacing a 100% damage dealing ability (her current passive) with a different 100% damage ability (her new Q), right?\n\nShe's not LOSING any Utility. At all. In any capacity. In fact, getting Frost Shot as a passive _improves_ her Utility, as she no longer has to spend mana on it, or waste time with ranks in it.","replies":[{"poster":"Reikken","date":"2015-04-29T20:34:45.869+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know she's not LOSING anything. I never said she was. It's just disappointing. They had the opportunity to add something, but didn't. \n\nAnd no, the slow being a passive doesn't improve her utility. The slow is weaker at early levels (5% at lv 1-3? that's nothing), and doesn't reach the old maximum until lv 16. And the mana cost was never an issue for me anyway.","replies":[{"poster":"Abyssphere","date":"2015-04-29T20:53:34.636+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Reikken,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=vNWElAh0,comment-id=000300000000,timestamp=2015-04-29T20:34:45.869+0000)\n>\n> I know she's not LOSING anything.

I think in some ways her utility is stronger than it used to be.","replies":[{"poster":"Venowolf","date":"2015-04-29T23:20:35.763+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like the new kit specially the huge amounts of build paths that she can eush now.

So I'll have weaker poke damage.\nAlso, the slow is do much weaker now.

No more toggling frost shot, no more having a single crit and then no passive, actually getting an AA steroid and her kit now played into her consistent damage utility style cohesively as oppose to feeling at odds with itself.\n\nI like Ashe now but the changes they are making to her are exactly how I wish they would of reworked champs like Sona, it doesn't just keep her identity it enhances it while removing the things that make her feel clunky.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SIayton","date":"2015-04-29T22:25:09.577+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"She doesn't really have any high points right now, and going oom using Q to kite sucks.
