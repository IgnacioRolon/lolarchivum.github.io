These changes indicate that for each second it charges, it now travels 35% further rather than 20% further.  It seems strange to me that Janna is getting buffed, and this sounds like a buff without any more info.  Is this buff intended to somewhat offset the nerf on the scaling on her R, or is the initial travel range on Q nerfed but this simply isn&#039;t indicated on the tooltip?  My assumption is kind of that the total travel range at full charge is the same, but Q travels less far if it isn&#039;t fully charged, but I haven&#039;t seen any discussion about this.\n\nThanks for any info!","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2015-08-22T00:40:03.502+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"Yeah, your guess is right.

You've already made it shitty to throw a fast Q by completely gutting its non charged damage at the start of last season. \n\nWhy is she even being nerfed? She's one of the only champions that can deal with Thresh and Alistar's domination of bot lane. Meanwhile Thresh has been picked 40%+ every game as a support since his release and you recently _buffed _him. Like wtf?\n\nThe nerfs to her AP ratio doesn't make any sense either, since most Janna's don't even build AP. Why are you punishing AP Janna when it's not popular at all right now, and actually fairly weak? \n\nWith the insane number of nerfs Janna has had (she's been nerfed more than any other champion) I'm fairly convinced the balance team has no idea how to balance her correctly.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RephaimGG","date":"2015-08-22T06:57:24.636+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"In all honesty, this is a nerf that I couldn't care less about.
