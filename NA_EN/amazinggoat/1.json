Support is as important as any other role, or even more important. The support controls the map, keeps teammates alive, heals, shields, peels, CCs, initiates, disengages, and babies the marksman in lane by healing, shielding, poking, zoning, warding, and even helping with last hitting.\n\nI barely play support and I hate supporting, but I still have respect for that role and I understand how important it is. The balance of any game can easily be tilted one way or the other by any role, including support.","replies":[{"poster":"Spacesuit Spiff","date":"2015-03-13T02:11:07.376+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"In bronze, adc is the most important role because 90% of games are decided by which adc wants to facetank everything (jk its usually both).

I also wasn't really worried if I was going to take any kills, because I didn't have anything for offense, besides my Meeps and my Q.\nHis ultimate allowed me to help people get kills even when I was no where near, or if I was fully intending to just get more chimes.\nI do agree with letting new champions be available in ranked after the first week, because no one wants to go against a new champion, since it's going to be a win for you (since no one knows how to fight the new champion) or a win for them (same reason, but could be because you don't know how to play as the new champ).\nI was with a Kalista yesterday, which was my first time as Bard, and I had no clue if it was her first time as well, but we were actually doing good, despite me leaving once at a bad time, but I always left a health pack or two before I left.\n30 assists...
