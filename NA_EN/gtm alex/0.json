Im just wondering.\n\nI'm not part of the team that developed the system, so I couldn't say for sure.  My guess is that we all simply make mistakes sometimes, and the token system is intended to help in those cases.  While I know it can be used for content that one may decide they no longer want, it may have been for situations where the purchase was accidental.  There are other opportunities to try new content, like hextech shards and free champion rotations, so the token system could be used for those accidents and not trials.  If you have any feedback on the system, let your voice be heard and post it over at [Misc](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous) for the community and devs to see.  Hope that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"TheHowester","date":"2016-10-14T21:35:35.009+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Porocles,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=zJmc8UUi,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2016-10-14T21:10:28.758+0000)\n>\n> I&#x27;m not part of the team that developed the system, so I couldn&#x27;t say for sure.
