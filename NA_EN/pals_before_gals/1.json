Basically if he bought his braum before december he won't be able to refund it. So give us 1 more refund is kind of useless since a lot of stuff are more than 3 months old.

I'm not a financial specialist so idk if what is said in the announcement holds water but i'll have to give them the benefit of doubt for now.\n\nRefunds are meant to be used as a way to get back your RP, not your money.

If Riot cared THAT much, they would never have allowed the playerbase to unlock free skins every week from Loot alone that are often legendaries, legacies or even ultimate skins. Usually epic though. The system is quite literally a machine that works against Riot's sales just so we can have something nice.\n\nThey have already monetized ridiculous things like Aatrox' prestige skin and the passes but if it was up to me, i'd get to work on announcers and map skins etc. Things we've actually asked for.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Jennifer420","date":"2019-02-21T01:05:19.890+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"ah yes the joke of \"riot needs 4-5 years to listen to us\" once again becomes reality.","replies":[{"poster":"GigglesO","date":"2019-02-21T02:58:39.316+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Was gonna say 4-5 years is how long it takes for them to move on anything. \n\nLooks at morde. \nYep reworked 4 years ago.","replies":[{"poster":"Jennifer420","date":"2019-02-21T03:32:35.470+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"there is so much more than just morde. sooo many things lol.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"General Matty","date":"2019-02-20T17:11:22.671+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I made a post about it too.
