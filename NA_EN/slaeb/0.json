I have been holding off playing normals for almost a week now in the hopes that a Rioter (anyone at all, doesn't need to be famous by any means) would be willing to play my first game after 999 normal wins with me. I have been playing this game for so long and it has been such a fun part of my life that I would really enjoy meeting one of you great people who made this game possible and get a chance to thank you! If there's no one who can play I completely understand, I'm just holding out hope that one day I will get to thank you.\r\n\r\nThanks for the consideration,\r\nSlaeb","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-01-28T01:03:19.413+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hiya!
