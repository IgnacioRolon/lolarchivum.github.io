I recently picked the game back up and every time I log on and try to play I'm in Low Priority queue. How much longer is it going to be in effect? I'm sure I've played more than 5 games at this point and it's severely impacting my urge to continue.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-07-29T23:43:55.474+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"[Leaverbuster](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ) will remain on an account until the required games are completed without leaving.  I looked into this for you, and it looks like you have 2 games left.  Your leaverbuster was escalated so it required a bit more than 5.  Let me know if that clears things up!","replies":[{"poster":"Zanicx","date":"2017-07-30T02:50:35.646+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks! I was wondering what was.
