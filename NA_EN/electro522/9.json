Instead, one day, I opened up my task manager, and noticed a program called \"Service Host: Local System\" was taking up the majority of my internet. Now, I travel for a living, and I use my phone as a WIfi hotspot, thus any internet I use is in short supply. If anything is loading or using even a drop of my internet, I get a lag spike in League (otherwise, I can play from anywhere of 90 to 170 ping), and so far, this Service Host has been a primary culprit (when its not running, my ping is just fine).\r\n\r\nSo, I tried stopping the program through Task Manager, but got a pop up saying that if I do this, bad things will happen. I didn't exactly know what this program was, so, I looked it up. Turns out, its not just one program, but a series of programs that simply keep my computer running. Thats when I noticed, in Task Manager, next to this program, there was a drop down arrow. I click that, and see several other programs ranging from \"Windows Update\" to \"Delivery Optimization\", but, unfortunately, the Task Manager doesn't tell you which systems is using what resources. When I looked it up, I did learn that you can stop 1 or 2 of these programs, however, I am not tech savvy enough to know which of these programs is safe to shut down, or even which would be taking up the majority of my internet (note: it isn't the Window's Update. That seemed the safest to shut down first.....and nothing happened).\r\n\r\nSo, I'm here to ask any Tech Gurus out there (Riot or not) for some advice here. While this is running, its difficult to even load a web page, simply due to the amount of internet resources being funneled into this program. Any ideas? I'll be willing to answer any questions or take any advice.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-18T23:00:42.713+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While Mobile Hotspots are super convenient, they rarely provide a great connection for League. Since League requires a ton of synchronizing your connection and others actions to the server, each packet is really important. We've covered this in great detail in our [Ethernet vs. WiFi article](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/page/ethernet-vs-wifi-ping-packets-playing-better).\n\nThere are some steps in our [connection troubleshooting guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) that may help with your situation, but you may need to reach out to your Hotspot provider to ensure your data isn't being throttled.\n\nLet me know if those steps caused any change.","replies":[{"poster":"Electro522","date":"2016-09-19T04:42:53.146+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Although, I do appreciate the reply Targons, my Wifi and Mobile Hotspot isn't the problem.....its a program on my computer thats the problem............at least I think it is.\n\nUnder normal conditions using my Mobile Hotspot, my ping sits comfortably around 90 to 170 ping, depending on my location, and how much data is coming through my phone. However, if any other program is running while I'm playing a game of League (Like the problematic \"Service Host: Local System\" I mentioned), then a portion of my data coming through my phone is divided among League and whatever other program is demanding some sort of data feed, causing the lag spike.\n\nNormally, I can keep these programs under control (for example; I have Steam on my computer. If its running, I normally get lag spikes, and its easy to shut down). What I'm asking here is how to keep the collection of programs called \"Service Host: Local System\" under control. I don't want to straight up kill it, for fear out of what it might do to my computer. I'm not sure if Riot has ever encountered a problem similar to mine, so I understand if this would be out of your realm, I was just trying to see if anyone had an idea as to what I should do. If not......well......I guess I can go to Microsoft, and see if they have an answer.\n\nAgain, thanks for the reply! Hopefully, I can hear from you again soon.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-19T15:48:29.574+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bandwidth prioritization is something that's available on normal routers, but with a mobile hotspot, I'm not entirely sure there's a way to ensure League gets most of your bandwidth. As for the specific applications and services under Service Host: Local System, you probably do want to reach out to Microsoft about this, since they'll be much more familiar with what that runs.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
