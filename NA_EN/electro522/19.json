It is by no means funny, it is straight up witch hunt material.\r\n\r\nYes, I get it, Riot didn't openly admit a change they made to orange essence. I can't argue with people who are upset about that. But, going as far to say that Riot Games, a company who has been praised as being one of the best gaming companies in the country to work for, and a company that prides itself in being very open with it's playerbase is now all of a sudden on the same level of Electronic arts, a company that has been criticized as being one of the *worst* companies to work for in the country, and has *NEVER* been open with it's playerbase, and has _**LIED**_ to it's customers for _**DECADES**_.\r\n\r\nDon't believe me? Here's proof:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTLFNlu2N_M\r\n\r\nEA is the epitome of corporate greed, and they have been this way for *decades*. Now, Riot makes a single mistake, and people are suddenly comparing them to that trash heap of a company. \r\n\r\nI am not defending Riot in their mistake, but I am trying to knock some God damned sense into people. This is honestly the lowest I have ever seen the boards get, and you know what? Had this happened at *any other time*, we probably wouldn't even be having this discussion.","replies":[]}
