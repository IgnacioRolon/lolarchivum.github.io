I understand one of the cohesive goals here was to make him look more properly Noxian. I wasn't supremely attached to his old look (I mainly used Tyrant with bits of classic/Northern Front/2% or so of Bilgewater), so I'm not going to mislead there.\n\nBeatrice not being on his shoulder in some form _irritates_ me to no end, however. I know there's passive crow usage and the nod with the ultimate. But it was an important character relationship to me. I assume it was not included because she could be visually misleading in some way or make him too busy. But I also don't see why she couldn't have some kind of perch on his old jacket. \n\nI've been trying to eyeball his jacket/Swain himself in-game to see if it's really create a clash to re-imagine his old perch. I don't think it would sans with his ultimate and that's still an IF. It really hurts his character to have the raven-theme diminished for a more generic overlord/warlock look.\n\nWhich ties into the ultimate---and is more of a secondary complaint. It felt like this was no reason not to keep the full transformation look as well. I don't know if it's because there was deadlines with modeling or what. But it was one of the fun parts of transforming and felt like you really embraced the transformation. I'm not really fond of the \"just the wings\" aspect with the graphical pop-in. Graphical pop-in looks great---I don't want to pay it disrespect, but it's brief. The movement animation looks a bit awkward (kind of reminds me of Kayle/Aatrox ult).  It's still readable though for an in-game perspective, so it works.\n\nThough I really liked his present kit (I was very happy with the Q rework; I like him as a dot mage), I'm going to try to be optimistic here:\n\nThe kit on the other hand barring numbers looks promising without him being as oppressive (though now it's a lot of skillshots of varying length and delay). With the increased vision/CC, I understand wanting to gate him. I'll have to see it in actual practice. I imagine rylai/glacial augment might play well with him. Especially since I presume he'll still be wanting hourglass.","replies":[{"poster":"Syrdon","date":"2018-01-23T19:17:21.301+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":2,"body":"Agreed.
