{"poster":"Electro522","date":"2018-04-19T22:07:11.311+0000","title":"Since Riot is ramping up the VGUs even more...","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":31,"down_votes":7,"body":"How about we make a list of champs that we, as a community, feel needs the VGU treatment the most?\n\nI&#039;ll split this list into different tiers, following the gaming grading system (S, A, B, C, D). The higher the tier the champ is in, the more in need they are of a VGU.\n\nNow, this first batch of champs will be of my opinion, and may not fit the opinion of the rest of the community. That&#039;s why I will leave this open to suggestions. If you feel I made a wrong choice somewhere, or a certain champ I missed really needs to be placed in a tier, let me know and I&#039;ll tweak it!\n\nJust remember that this list will represent the views of the community, and not Riot. No matter how much we try and tweak it, it may very well not even come close to Riot&#039;s list.\n\nBut with that said, let us begin, shall we?\n\n-----------------\n-----------------\n-----------------\n\n#S Tier\n\nThe S tier of champs are champs that have effectively been forgotten in League. They have extremely poor playrates (mainly only being played by dedicated one tricks), and win rates tend to stagnate well below the 50% line for months, or even years. Before their updates happened, this is where both {{champion:83}} Yorick and {{champion:6}} Urgot would have been placed.\n\nhttps://img.fireden.net/v/image/1506/44/1506445358198.jpg\n##Mordekaiser\n\nYou all knew this was coming. Anyone remember how Urgot&#039;s popularity only existed because he was so damn bad? He was, hands down, the worst champion in League for a *REALLY* long time, and his popularity was lifted due to him being basically a meme.\n\nThis is where Mordekaiser is right now. He may not be the worst champion in League, at least, but his eventual VGU has become so ingrained into our minds (mostly thanks to the efforts of Malicious Metal), that all of us are eagerly waiting for that announcement.\n\nUnfortunately, the only reason why Morde hasn&#039;t been reworked yet is because Riot doesn&#039;t really know what to do with him. The only thing they do know is that they will be keeping his theme.......but kit wise? He will likely still be a juggernaut, but how his kit will actually play out is anyone&#039;s guess.\n\nhttp://www.lol-wallpapers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Fiddlesticks-by-dw628-HD-Wallpaper-Fan-Art-Artwork-League-of-Legends-lol.jpg\n##Fiddlesticks\n\nAnother champ that good ol&#039; Malicious Metal has been clamoring for is our favorite scarecrow...........and I have to agree with him.\n\nPut simply......Fiddle has not aged well. In our high mobility meta, it&#039;s very strange that a champ would have more than half of his kit reliant on *standing still*. His kit is also a weird amalgamation of a tank&#039;s and a mage&#039;s, all crammed into a squishy frame. He&#039;s meant to engage, but can hardly survive when he does; he&#039;s meant to have alot sustain, but Grievous Wounds exist; he&#039;s meant to be a jungler, but works best as a support..................Fiddle is just a mess.\n\nhttp://leagueofpictures.altervista.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Pantheon-and-Leona-League-of-Legends-Fan-Art.jpg\n##Pantheon\n\nYes.....I know MM has also called for a Pantheon rework, but that is not why I&#039;m putting him up here.\n\nPantheon is actually one of the champs that Riot has talked about wanting to rework quite a bit in the past.........and it makes sense as to why. Pantheon has evolved into being more of an assassin instead of being the penultimate fighter (that title, at the moment, goes to Riven). Not to mention that his kit is considered to be one of the most toxic in the game. Being a relic of League&#039;s earliest days, his kit still has 2 point and click abilities (something that is quickly being fazed out), and the only skill expression it offers is being able to place your ult in the right spot...........and even that isn&#039;t all to difficult (&quot;Are enemies in this location? Yes? Drop on them.)\n\nhttps://art-of-lol.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Malzahar-League-Of-Legends-Fan-Art-1.jpg\n##Malzahar\n\nYou know.......I almost forgot about Malzahar.\n\nOh boy........where do I begin? The mage update did not treat him well......Malz has been turned into this monstrosity of a champion that really has no place at all in League. His kit just *breathes* toxicity.......point and click DoT damage, point and click ranged super cc, and a built in Banshee&#039;s Veil for his passive.\n\nI don&#039;t think I need to say much more.........this champ needs a complete reimagining.\n\n---------------------\n\n#A Tier\n\nThankfully, we only have 4 champs that are in S tier. You may disagree, and if you do, I want you to take one hard look at the roster...........besides those 4, who else is in such dire need of a rework...........besides {{champion:20}} Nunu (since he just got announced)?\n\nThe A tier of champs are champs that haven&#039;t necessarily aged well, but can still work to some degree. No one will be surprised to see them be reworked, but no one is also really calling for their rework. Due to her being announced awhile back, she can&#039;t be on this list, but this is likely where {{champion:84}} Akali would go.\n\nhttp://www.lol-wallpapers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ChoGath-by-jorcerca-HD-Wallpaper-Fan-Art-Artwork-League-of-Legends-lol.jpg\n##Cho'gath\n\nA few people mentioned that Cho'gath should be on the list. I personally disagree, but this is meant to be a community list, so.....\n\nHere is Ryusaether's explanation as to why:\n\n\"{{champion:31}} , while in a decent spot balance-wise (after passing through his monstrous winrate after Stoneplate came out) is still pretty underwhelming compared to his thematic potential. You have a world eater monser that just walks and creates spikes, wow. And his model and animations are pretty outdated, he could be so much more.\"\n\nhttps://img00.deviantart.net/e25a/i/2011/248/d/f/dr__mundo_by_yubigd-d48x5wt.jpg\n##Dr. Mundo\n\nWhat if i told you that MUNDO was once the king of tanks..........back in Season 4. Ever since he lost that crown, it&#039;s jumped from champ to champ, but that isn&#039;t to say that MUNDO used to be unmatched.\n\nToday, however, he&#039;s in need of some help. He can still do quite well in the right hands, but it&#039;s just that he can&#039;t keep up with the current roster........*literally*. Tanks today are CC machines; if they don&#039;t have at least 2 or 3 abilities that can lock down a priority target, they generally won&#039;t perform very well..........and MUNDO&#039;s only form of CC is a decent slow.\n\nHe is the definition of a meat shield..........and the game right now simply doesn&#039;t call for *just* meat shields right now.\n\nhttps://static.lolwallpapers.net/2015/08/Ezreal-Fan-Art-By-Pixiv.png\n##Ezreal\n\nSurprised? Well.....there is one reason, and one reason alone that I put Ezreal in the A tier category...............his Q.\n\nMystic Shot has been a thorn in Riot&#039;s side for a *VERY* long time. Every time they release a new item or mechanic that works with on hit mechanics..........Ezreal comes around and breaks it because of Mystic Shot. His most recent crime is that of Kelptomancy. When the new runes were released, he was easily the strongest ADC in the game because of that rune........and Mystic Shot procing it every 2 seconds.\n\nThere is so much power packed into his Q, that the rest of his kit suffers for it. His W is basically only used to proc spellblade, and help take objectives (kind of), his E is mainly used as a get-of-jail-free card, and his ultimate is mainly used for clearing waves of minions.\n\nPut simply, this ability needs to go.......and with it gone, the rest of Ezreal&#039;s kit could be more heavily fleshed out.\n\nhttps://pre00.deviantart.net/fe4c/th/pre/i/2015/094/0/2/kalista_fan_art_by_jasontn-d8oftww.jpg\n##Kalista\n\nCome on......admit it Riot..........she needs a fullscale rework.\n\nKalista is in a very precarious state.......if Riot buffs her *even slightly*, she starts to dominate the LCS.........and thus, they&#039;re forced to nerf her, leaving her in an awful state for solo queue. But can you blame the LCS? Consistent free mobility, free *roaming* wards, awesome objective control, the ability to save a teammate, and the ability to have said teammate engage on the enemy team........even if the champ they are playing can&#039;t engage on their own. Seriously, she is an LCS team&#039;s wet dream!\n\nAt the moment, she is in an........ok spot, which is the only reason why she isn&#039;t S tier right now. But, needless to say, she will eventually need that rework.\n\nhttp://www.lol-wallpapers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Malphite-by-DanMaynard-HD-Wallpaper-Fan-Art-Artwork-League-of-Legends-lol.jpg\n##Malphite\n\nAnother champ that a couple people asked for. This one I can agree on.\n\nAgain, Ryusaether gives a good explanation as to why:\n\n\"{{champion:54}} is a fucking moving rock, quite literally. He's not engaging to play as nor against, boring uninteractive laner and an ult-bot. Plus his design and skins are pretty shallow and could benefit an overhaul in every aspect, like making him the anti-ad he should be by giving him an armor shield and not a generic shield and things like that, other than a funnier playstyle. Ofc not every champ has to be the outplay master like Irelia or the likes, but I think everyone can agree that he's boring as hell.\"\n\nhttps://img00.deviantart.net/73ac/i/2012/010/1/3/nocturne_fanart_by_4dollar-d4lz505.jpg\n##Nocturne\n\nSeveral people suggested Nocturne to be here. However, I'll let GorrilaBearz (who was the first to suggest him) explain why.\n\n\"Well for starters {{champion:56}} is extremely outdated, not only in his one-dimensional kit but also his visuals minus his eternum skin, which even that is starting to show its age. He is very feast or famine, if ahead can insta-burst a squishy with a point and click long range ultimate, but if behind gets blown up instantly if he dives anywhere into a team fight, making him almost completely useless. Either way, his kit is very binary with hardly any depth in any of his abilities, he’s basically a ball of stats which doesn’t leave much room for interaction for his enemies. Just a lot of problems all around, and not to mention he has one of the coolest (imo) thematics in the game but with him being so dated his visuals and everything just don’t do him justice.\"\n\nhttps://img00.deviantart.net/bfdb/i/2013/046/9/9/quinn_by_yy6242-d5v07ag.png\n##Quinn\n\nI think you know you done goofed when an ADC becomes primarily a top laner.\n\nQuinn, much like quite a few others on this list, suffers from an identity crisis.........is she a marksman, or an assassin? At the moment she&#039;s.......both? Her laning matches that of an ADC, but come mid to late game, she shifts to being an assassin.\n\nEssentially, Quinn needs her identity to be solidified as one or the other........and I think the general consensus is to solidify her as an assassin. This means stripping her of everything that is meant to help her as a Marksman, specifically her W and maybe her passive.\n\nNow, admittedly, I am not very familiar with Quinn. If there are any dedicated Quinn mains out there that would like elaborate on this further, by all means, please do. That said, I think we can all agree that Quinn needs some help.\n\nhttp://www.leaguesplash.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Royal-Shaco-Ch.jpg\n##Shaco\n\nThe only reason why Shaco is this high is because Riot has stated that he is quite high on their list of champs to be reworked, and all of the tweaks he has gotten in the past have only proven to alienate him further.\n\nIn my opinion, I think he&#039;s more deserving of a B tier ranking, since Riot has been able to get him into somewhat of an ok spot. But, I will admit that his kit could use some cleaning up, not to mention that his theme *in general* could use a pretty a big overhaul.\n\nSimilar to Quinn, I am not all too familiar with Shaco......so, if any dedicated mains out there could help elaborate on him, it would be appreciated.\n\nhttps://art-of-lol.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/44c72944292171e3fb5f5078f4c933bc.jpg\n##Tryndamere\n\nYou are now looking at my most hated champ in the game. \n\nI *despise* Tryndamere. i hate that the most effective strategy for him is to never leave his lane. I hate that he can get out of most bad situations so damn easily. I hate that no matter what you do to him in lane, EVENTUALLY, he will come back, and 2 shot your carries, OR your towers.\n\nSo, yes, his ranking right now might be inflated due to my opinion of him, I will admit to that. However, I know everyone can agree that he *should* be high on Riot&#039;s list of champs to rework. Sure, he may not need the work done *right now*, but eventually........please........rework this champ.\n\nhttps://img00.deviantart.net/32d8/i/2016/039/a/3/lol_fan_art_varus_by_berylcirclet-d9qztdy.jpg\n##Varus\nSuggested by Darkin Hybrid\n\nHe wrote a REALLY long reason as to why, so, instead of copy/pasting him, I'll link his comment [here](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/Pcjxq4FT-since-riot-is-ramping-up-the-vgus-even-more?comment=0011)\n\nhttps://img00.deviantart.net/af4f/i/2013/038/8/0/iceborn_volibear_by_kirikaito-d5u442t.jpg\n##Volibear\n\nNow, now.........even though he recently had some work done, this doesn&#039;t mean he no longer needs a rework.\n\nIn fact, if I&#039;m not mistaken, his recent work was only to put him in a somewhat decent place until Riot could get around to reworking him (and it certainly did that, according to how Voli mains reacted to it).\n\nEssentially, Voli&#039;s kit just doesn&#039;t belong in today&#039;s League. He&#039;s meant to be a tank, but has kit more fitting for a Juggernaut. Also, now that his lore was updated with Ornn&#039;s release, he is now *even less* representative of his demigod fantasy. He should feel overwhelming, as if he will bring down the fury of the Maelstrom down on top of you........but right now? He feels like a normal Polar Bear.\n\nhttp://www.lol-wallpapers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Wukong-by-lancer0519-HD-Wallpaper-Fan-Art-Artwork-League-of-Legends-lol.jpg\n##Wukong\n\nThe amount of calls for a Wukong update has been growing steadily over the past few months........and with good reason. Before recently, Wukong was always middle of the pack......he could perform decently in the right hands, but was never top of the meta. Now, however, he struggles in most situations.\n\nHe has some of the best engage opportunities in the game, but can hardly survive to really act on those engages. So, similar to Pantheon, he&#039;s evolved into more of an assassin, but with far less tools to actually assassinate people.\n\nThat said, he still isn&#039;t as dire in need of rework as our S tier champs.......but over time, he will continue to slowly fall into that category.\n\n-----------------------\n\n#B Tier\n\nNow.....if you&#039;ve read this far.....don&#039;t worry, I&#039;m not going to give a paragraph for every champ. In fact, from here on out, I&#039;m only going to list the champs in every tier.\n\nB Tier champs are those that have aged decently over the months and years, but as time goes on, it becomes quite evident that eventually they&#039;re going to need some work. They don&#039;t need it *now*, certainly not as much as the S or A tier ranks, but.........eventually.\n\nhttp://www.lol-wallpapers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Amumu-by-Hozure-HD-Wallpaper-Artwork-Fan-Art-League-of-Legends-lol.jpg\n##Amumu\n\nhttps://img00.deviantart.net/eff9/i/2016/312/4/d/anivia_wallpaper_by_xlzipx-danq6sp.png\n##Anivia\n\nhttps://orig00.deviantart.net/920e/f/2017/051/6/d/lol_diana_fanart_by_callergi-d8sb3al.jpg\n##Diana\nMoved up from C Tier as suggested by Derpyon\n\n\"Personally, Diana needs to be B at the very least\n\nShe's also suffers from a semi identity crisis she's a diver, that acts more like an assassin. She lacks the tools to really survive in the later portions of the game to fit a diver like the likes of {{champion:164}} ,{{champion:5}} but she can't exactly afford to invest much into defence. She has high base stats for a 'assassin' though. She has *very* high burst damage, but she lacks the tools for escape so you have to hope that your W will pull you through the barrage of pain you'll endure.\n\nPersonally, if she sees work, I'd love to see more emphasis on her passive, and whole heretic solari theme.\"\n\nhttps://art-of-lol.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Jax-League-Of-Legends-Fan-Art.jpg\n##Jax\n\nhttps://art-of-lol.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Karma-League-Of-Legends-FanArt.jpg\n##Karma\n\nhttps://pre00.deviantart.net/c333/th/pre/i/2015/027/5/f/league_of_legends__karthus_in_oilpaint_by_skimoenderrusso-d8fmwbf.jpg\n##Karthus\n\nhttps://static.lolwallpapers.net/2015/07/Kayle-Fan-Art.jpg\n##Kayle\n\nhttps://pre00.deviantart.net/6b1e/th/pre/f/2015/259/1/e/kindred_by_vegacolors-d99uuf1.jpg\n##Kindred\n\nhttps://pre00.deviantart.net/09b1/th/pre/f/2016/254/e/1/morgana_league_of_legends_by_chubymi-dah8s6d.jpg\n##Morgana\nSuggested by nm1010\n\n\"I've played only around two dozen games this season on her, but she is probably at her strongest in years for mid lane. At 1-2 items q w is one shotting people, gank assist with q e and r is pretty toxic imo.\n\nIf she stays under the radar I would put her in B tier (needs work eventually, but fine for the moment). If she starts to see widespread play I would bump her into A. She is highly uninteractive in lane and with her mid game spike she could easily become very problematic.\"\n\nhttps://orig00.deviantart.net/40cc/f/2012/120/d/e/rumble_by_inkinesss-d4y4csc.jpg\n##Rumble\n\nhttps://orig00.deviantart.net/8a6c/f/2013/324/1/0/battle_cast_skarner_by_akiman-d6v00wy.jpg\n##Skarner\n\nhttps://art-of-lol.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/league-of-legends-vladimir.jpg\n##Vladimir\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#C Tier\n\nC tier champs are those that people would likely be kind of surprised to see an update come through for them. However, when they think of it, they then realize that........yeah, they could have used some work. Before her update, this is where {{champion:114}} would have went.\n\nhttps://cdna.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/007/663/846/large/konstant-g-k-rb-corki.jpg?1507694297\n##Corki\n\nhttps://pre00.deviantart.net/3112/th/pre/f/2015/007/9/a/league_of_legends_elise_fanart_by_sickbrush-d8cz52o.png\n##Elise\n\nhttps://pre00.deviantart.net/c915/th/pre/i/2013/068/9/f/hecarim_by_leekent-d5xjhol.jpg\n##Hecarim\n\nhttps://orig00.deviantart.net/0456/f/2012/337/3/3/jarvan_iv__fan_art_by_zionenciel-d5n005p.jpg\n##Jarvan IV\n\nhttps://img00.deviantart.net/544b/i/2016/103/a/1/kennen___the_heart_of_the_tempest__fanart__by_crowdel-d9yszil.jpg\n##Kenen\n\nhttps://static.lolwallpapers.net/2015/07/KogMaw-Fan-Art.jpg\n##Kog&#039;maw\n\nhttps://art-of-lol.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Lissandra-League-Of-Legends-Fan-Art-1.jpg\n##Lissandra\n\nhttps://img00.deviantart.net/4bcf/i/2016/287/6/1/master_yi__fan_art__by_lionsketch-d72jsr1.jpg\n##Master Yi\nSuggested by Kadexe\n\n\"I feel like Master Yi is left out for no real reason.\n\n* He's the worst offender of \"champions that stomp low elo, but are useless against players that work as a team.\"\n\n* He's awful to play against if he's not shut down. Legit the only counterplay is 1) CC him so hard that he's not even really fighting you, or 2) use spells and items like Zhonya or Kayle ult to delay his reset so he can be killed. Everything comes back to \"just don't fight him.\"\n\n* 3/5ths of his abilities are just stat buffs and steroids. It's a very uninteractive kit.\n\nHe needs a rework, and I say that as a very vocal Yi main.\"\n\nhttps://orig00.deviantart.net/db3f/f/2014/150/c/a/sona___league_of_legends_by_ofskysociety-d7kdjmj.jpg\n##Sona\n\nhttps://img00.deviantart.net/e10e/i/2016/241/5/0/lol_fanart_syndra_by_orekigenya-dafoypt.jpg\n##Syndra\n(There is a TON of awesome Syndra fan art.......I suggest you check it out)\n\nhttps://pre00.deviantart.net/f40b/th/pre/f/2016/147/b/3/tristana_by_vegacolors-da40hrc.jpg\n##Tristana\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n#D Tier\n\nAnd finally.....our last tier. These champs are those that, as of *right now*, could use some work. However, they&#039;ve been good in the past, and the meta may very well conform to their play style. Due to this, they may not need any work at all, and if they do get some significant work done, it would be a bit of a surprise.\n\nhttps://static.lolwallpapers.net/2016/07/57938035f3f2d-932x620.png\n##Fizz\n\nhttp://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ARNu5XDDrHQ/UwMh_nzW_AI/AAAAAAAABqc/Elw_RgIf1Bo/s1600/Gragas-League-of-Legends-Wallpaper-full-HD-1.jpg\n##Gragas\n\nhttps://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/7/77/Ivern_promo_05.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20160922000326\n##Ivern\n\nhttps://img00.deviantart.net/281d/i/2016/154/f/2/dark_star__lucian__by_wandakun-da4vfw7.png\n##Lucian\n\nhttps://img00.deviantart.net/194c/i/2013/224/2/b/rammus_by_waltrex-d6htj2w.jpg\n##Rammus\n\nhttps://img00.deviantart.net/589f/i/2016/022/7/5/renekton_by_apocalypse_tr-d9oy3tn.jpg\n##Renekton\n\nhttps://img00.deviantart.net/c5ef/i/2016/324/0/7/viktor_fan_art_by_jasontn-dap1lgl.jpg\n##Viktor\n\n------------------------------\n---------------------------------\n----------------------------\n\nAnd that&#039;s it!

The Villain mechanic punishes Garen's laning opponent for smart macro play if they roam and manage to get a kill. Once they return to lane however, they find that Garen's true damage now shreds them like butter, making them perform worse than before they snagged their lead in lane. That is why Garen can't also be allowed to have a powerful laning phase. But because he's a slow sack of shit with no gap-closer, minimal CC, and relatively pedestrian damage, he falls off late game as well.\n\nGaren fulfills no function, he has no strengths.

He is very feast or famine, if ahead can insta-burst a squishy with a point and click long range ultimate, but if behind gets blown up instantly if he dives anywhere into a team fight, making him almost completely useless. Either way, his kit is very binary with hardly any depth in any of his abilities, he’s basically a ball of stats which doesn’t leave much room for interaction for his enemies. Just a lot of problems all around, and not to mention he has one of the coolest (imo) thematics in the game but with him being so dated his visuals and everything just don’t do him justice.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"nm1010","date":"2018-04-19T22:47:13.537+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think you forgot Morgana, binary champion who is currently sleeper op mid imo.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ZaneShadow","date":"2018-04-19T22:18:28.579+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"my list (outside of the current ones on scheduel)\n{{champion:82}} {{champion:10}} {{champion:36}} {{champion:72}}{{champion:32}} \n\nThese are champs that whenever I see, their abilities and themes are either Ryze levels of problematic, or don't synergize well together.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BLIGHTBRINGER","date":"2018-04-20T01:16:45.962+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{champion:110}} A tier.\n\nHis kit, his theme, his lore and just about everything just doesn't work all together to make sense. Some parts of him need to be changed to make sense and I will be stating those things below.\n\nQuick note: This is response is coming from a 3 year Varus Main.\n\nRight let's start from the beginning.\n\nSo he is considered to be these following things: Hybrid Marksman, High Range Sniper.\n\nPassive: Living Vengeance\n\nI really dislike this passive, it just feels like a typical, boring Attack Speed steroid that other Marksman similarly have when they kill something. He has potential to have a more interactive, unique and interesting passive. The name of the passive proves to be so.\n\nQ: Piercing Arrow\n\nIn lore he is continuesly using his Q to kill most if not all enemies, and that has been his iconic ability since his release, it's what made him unique and stand out than the rest of Marksman. However I feel like the release of Kai'Sa (another Hybrid Marksman) puts Varus to shame, she has everything and does everything better than Varus besides the CC. Her Q actually feels really effective, since it has really high AD scallings, Varus Q also has high scallings but his damage is reduced when it comes in contact with more than one enemy (basically nullifying any damage  you deal) and the poke style he has/had just became/become really ineffective since his Q was nerfed several times such as; increasing the cooldown, lowering AD scalling and it just got worse even worse when everyone could just sustain so easily with previous Warlords Bloodlust or the current Fleet Footwork, allowing enemies to heal up any damage you do/did to them. With Kai'Sa however she has longer range on her W, scales with both AD and AP and deals more than 60% of the enemies health and the cooldown is reduced even more if she hits someone allowing her to spam that ability, which brings me to my point that she does what Varus does just better which in this case is poking.\n\nW: Blight Quiver\n\nThere is no mention of Blight (his W passive) or him spreading corruption (his R) in lore. Don't get me wrong I like that, because that's the hybrid side of Varus. But I just wish that the blight side of his kit wouldn't have all the power focused on that, I would like Varus to actually deal damage with his other abilities without needing to always proc blight stacks. Kai'Sa can build On-Hit, AP and AD all together and still outdamage Varus with her abilities even if he went full AD. He is so bad to build AD along with Crit that every pro who plays him would build On-Hit (before Rageblade Varus was meta) so like building BORK + Witts End + Runaan's Hurricane + Infinity Edge + GA which was good for a while until it slowly became useless. Then some people have been noticing the efficiency of building On-Hit Varus with some AP (Rageblade). Rageblade was the item that made Varus a viable Marksman and generally a good pick back then, since before he has had a 48% winrate before the On-Hit and Rageblade with AP became a thing and was considered to be a really bad Marksman back then. AP Varus became strong due to his W having crazy AP % Max Health scallings, and it actually started off as an offmeta thing until it became this massive thing that people began abusing. This got so big to the point where people would just straight up build Rageblade and full AP from there to delete everything when proc'ing blight stacks. Riot has noticed the power of this and gave Varus W an Active while nerfing W Passive On-Hit damage to make him use his iconic ability Q more often than just AA someone to death which is great, I like that.\n\nE: Hail of Arrrows\n\nHis E is what I dislike most next to his passive, his E feels so useless (really bad scalling damage, delayed damage) and due to this it's only used to proc blight stacks and it's maxed first because of the slow it gives. It just feels like a such a boring, basic ability and it just makes me think that this was added for the sake of filling in the empty space in his kit. I can't remember if there was a reference to his E in the lore. But I would love to see this ability get replaced with something else.\n\nR: Chain of Corruption\n\nHis R is good, I have no issues with it. Would like some better visuals for it though along with the W stack visual update.\n\nThere's one other thing in lore he was described as a mad killer who torments his enemies before closing in for the kill with his Q. Either suggesting that he is fast, or that he is able to outrange so far that he can attack safely.\n\nThe current issues:\n\n* Is a hybrid who has the option to build flexibly but it's pointless and inefficient to do so. \n* Being high ranged is no longer a unique element in the game and he became outclassed in this category.\n* Too much power and emphasis on the Blight side of his kit, and abilities alone have little to no effect.\n* Get's outclassed as a hybrid by any other hybrid (Jax who can build AP, AD, On-Hit while dealing relatively lots of damage, the same for Kai'Sa).\n* Passive quite a dull self-buff attack speed steroid.\n* Has no mobility (presumedly traded for the damage power he has).\n\nNot to mention I would love a new fresh Varus with a new in-game model with Q, W and R to be kept and for him to have a new passive and new E ability. Better animations, visuals and sound effects. Since soon all the Darkin will be fresh in terms of being new and updated and Varus will be the only one who will be forgotten and left like this.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SnugglePuggle94","date":"2018-04-20T02:37:01.105+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Karma needs to be S tier.

Fast forward to Bloodrazor and it's pretty good with her, so eventually she gets nerfed because she becomes too good for a short period of time. Similar situation with Press the Attack.\n\nShe's doing fairly fine for now in terms of winrate but that still doesn't cut out some major issues she has:\n\n* No CC outside of Ult - This is probably the biggest issue I have with her. The only CC she ever can have is her ult, which only gives a small knockback rather than a drag. It can be say good for a quick disruption of a channel or initiation, but that's only good later on in say mid and late game. But for early game, she basically can't gank pre-6 unless the enemy laner is right at your allies tower, you have red buff and glacial augment (though I think people have just stopped running it on her or at least vast majority).\n\n* Item Dependent/Farm Heavy - Shyvana can have a lot of damage based on her kit: % health damage debuff on E, Magic damage mixed with W and AA, & Q is a double auto for more of those bonuses. But she also has to rely on items a bit, both for more synergy for her kit and to fill in some missing gaps. Bloodrazer is an example of synergy, giving % health damage as well as attack speed, and Frozen Mallet is an example of filling in the gaps for her, since it gives her some form of non-ult CC and pairs well with her being AA reliant. In order to obtain these though, you just need to farm constantly. There's a saying with Shyvana of her \"beating you with a giant bag of gold\" and that can't be more accurate. She's a jungle champ that needs to heavily farm up in order to get her items early and start going and if you steal her camps she can't really get anywhere. In short, she's a feast or famine champ that relies on how much farm she can gain fast.\n\n* Her Passive is Terrible! - Speaking of Feast or Famine, let's look over one element of her kit that literally makes her that. Now granted this does bring up the fact that she received a mini-\"rework\" already, but overall I didn't find it that great, even with additions of a better feeling dragon e and Dragon Form bonuses. Her old passive was basically free stats, doubled in dragon form, but scaled somewhat through the game. INSTEAD NOW her small bonus stats are tied to how many dragons she can collect. Oh, but she has extra bonus to dragons now. Great I guess? Outside of SR, this passive works weirdly, like TT you take the equivalent to Baron, which why is that the only way to get those stats, and ARAM is destroying towers, which that all depends on how well your team comp is vs. the other random team comp. Either you/your team are securing dragons and you can have bonus stats that scale a bit in the game, or not and be stuck with extremely bad bonus stats through the whole game, as you can only get these through the 4 before elder. Yeah, I fucking hate her passive.\n\nIn short:\n-She lacks any CC in her base kit to be somewhat effective at early ganks, pre-6\n-She has to farm up for items, some of which she relies on heavily\n-She's a feast or famine type champion\n-She's mainly pure damage\n-Her passive is shit\n\nI love playing Shyvana but lately that's been going to an extent and I feel like she could use a small proper rework to bring her up a bit than to constantly have her as the \"lady with bag of gold for weapon\".","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tychusfindlay918","date":"2018-04-21T16:57:46.713+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tryndamere should be S tier IMO but eh whatever.\n\nI'd rank morde #1 on shit needs to happen for him and tryndamere pretty much right behind him.\n\nNasus might not need a visual update but he's tryndamere level cancer in terms of simplicity and win conditions (run at people, use insane autos, beat them into submission) but trades trynd's mobility for incredible tank potential instead.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AwesomeGuyDj","date":"2018-04-21T04:33:33.627+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would fucking kill for a jax rework.\nCancerous brain fuck of a champion\n\"me build cinderhulk me outduel everyone in the game me good\"\n_yes i know this is an exaggeration_","replies":[]},{"poster":"RavenMagus","date":"2018-04-21T01:58:21.737+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I came for the clickbait title, but I stayed for the fanart.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Violet Fields","date":"2018-04-20T23:55:51.554+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel like Kennen should be D Tier, if we're talking about both AD and AP, then yeah he probably need a rework to suit both playstyles, however if we're talking about just AP, what he primarily is suppose to be, he could really just have the AD scalings removed and his AP buffed so that every time ~~I start Doran's Blade I don't have 72 AD, it drives me nuts.~~ Actually, I'll just start with the new Doran's ring.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ackelope","date":"2018-04-20T23:42:26.396+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tryndamere's face reminds of Hanzo from Overwatch in that particular piece.\n\nAlso, I'd like to comment on a feeling I noticed while looking through this post.

The fact that it's a long range, highly adaptable, low cooldown skillshot that works specifically in the ways it does is a huge part of what makes him such an enjoyable champion. As much as it can be an annoyance in terms of balancing items damage/on-hit wise, I sincerely doubt the reason people will complain about Ez will be in reference to his Q, unless they're specifically thinking and talking about such examples as runeglaive, among others. The main reasons I hear people complain about him are almost always in reference to how easy it is for him to escape from situations, on account with his E, and (admittedly, though also often not directly), his Q's interaction with his E.\n\nNow, I'm very certain these apply to a lot of the other champions on this list.

Right know he doesn't need so much work but his ult is still pretty toxic gameplay-wise and forces him into really good or really bad because if the lack of counterplay. \n\nHis thematic is also just a Viking. That's it. Nothing else is special about him leaving him in a weird place in both the lore and looks. He's too generic and could use some sprucing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bioness","date":"2018-04-20T16:06:22.810+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I disagree with most of the list because you seem to be forgetting the VISUAL part of Visual and Gameplay Update (VGU).

I feel as though I'm credible because I'm one of the top ranked Nocturne mains based on stats and wins. \n\nNocturnes kit doesn't allow him any real exciting gameplay or out play's unless you shroud or dodge skill shot's.  Nocturne relies heavily on his ult,  without it,  he can't teamfight because he is so squishy that walking up will get him killed. \n\nHis kit is also very lacking in the fact that most assassins are highly mobile (especially recent reworked ones such as {{champion:28}}  that can go all in,  and press r to easily chunk your HP and disengage from a fight with atleast a kill.) What I mean is most assassins have a method of both engaging and disengaging,  and they often have the option of what they want to do with the skill.  Nocturne can only press r and all in,  he either one shots the enemy team,  or gets one shot,  there's no versatility to him. \n\nAs a Noct main I also have to say there's not much he can do against certain champions,  like xayah who can become untargetable.  I understand Xayah is meant to be a counter,  but since Nocturne's whole kit is reliant upon his ult being up,  I find  that sometimes I have no viable options as to who I can ult.  \n\nLikewise,  the opposite occurs when I'm against champions like varus, they legitimately can't do anything against me but get one shot the second they appear on the minimap. \n\nI feel his kit should still be able to one shot players as it currently is,  but it needs more variability. His model and splash art are also by far some of the most outdated and has been neglected.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SennaFirstPick","date":"2018-04-20T15:28:12.799+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i feel like nidalee should have been there too, she's like nidalee, but at the moment she's so feast or famine and in such a niche place that you never really see her, she really needs some work in the longer run but i think she will be fine with some buffs to her jungle clear, mainly stronger E early levels or even add a health regen effect to it and lower her full combo damage so if games go past 30 minutes she wont one shot your adc if he gets hit of one of her 1k damage spears. i suggest D tier","replies":[]},{"poster":"HeazonZ","date":"2018-04-20T15:18:31.023+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like the pictures you chose.

I'm really hoping he is the next to be announced since he is a major character in the shadow isles.\n\nI love {{champion:9}} but he is more annoying than useful\n\nI would put  {{champion:10}} {{champion:54}}  next however. Both are clunky, have on hit effects but awkward  auto animations and are defined by how good you can ult. I like playing malphite, his kit is fine for me, but he is just so clunky. Both also need lore overhalls.\n\n{{champion:56}} I forget this is a champion sometimes. He is usable, his kit isn't really that good other than the ult.\n\n{{champion:72}} {{champion:106}} are strong now but their kits don't live up to the high of their character. Well this giant crystal scorpian is going to auto you to death with his tiamat like q same for this armored bear demigod who can channel lightning.\n\n{{champion:80}} \n{{champion:62}} {{champion:23}} {{champion:11}} again nothing wrong, but their kits are fairly no interactive other than right-click or oneshot the enemy with point and click\n\n{{champion:77}} {{champion:67}} just need visual updates\n\nI disagree that the lower tier champions need reworks or worked on. A lot of champs listed are fine. While some individual spells could be adjust (ezreal w) most kits are complete and satisfing to play.

He's not engaging to play as nor against, boring uninteractive laner and an ult-bot. Plus his design and skins are pretty shallow and could benefit an overhaul in every aspect, like making him the anti-ad he should be by giving him an armor shield and not a generic shield and things like that, other than a funnier playstyle. Ofc not every champ has to be the outplay master like Irelia or the likes, but I think everyone can agree that he's boring as hell.\n\n{{champion:31}} , while in a decent spot balance-wise (after passing through his monstrous winrate after Stoneplate came out) is still pretty underwhelming compared to his thematic potential. You have a world eater monser that just walks and creates spikes, wow. And his model and animations are pretty outdated, he could be so much more.\n\nSame goes for {{champion:56}} , the personification of a nightmare who has to walk to you and punch you. His ult is surely really cool, his fear is meh ok, his spellshield is pretty out of place, and I'm sad kayn got the ability to walk over walls, because it could've been awesome on good ol' Noc. His model is really outdated, they have the technology to make his aethereal appearence much better now, and I hope he'll turn out as a great scary champ.\n\n{{champion:10}}/{{champion:25}} , I'm pretty sad they said that Morg is good kit-wise. Sure she's not that bad but ugh, pretty uninteractive. For Kayle I expect a lot, from making her model bigger than a damn child to giving her interactive abilities and not just AA steroids and targeted survivability buffs without outplay potential from the opponent.\n\nFor A tier, Udyr could use some love too but idk where to start, Rammus is a joke character, Shaco absolutely needs a new model and gameolay tweaks but idk what they could do with him.\n\nPassing into mini reworks needed, I think Aurelion Sol could use a more engaging kit (though I love him as he is, but it could be fun if they focus more on him getting faster, like giving him scaling on MS or making his stars go faster based on bonus MS, dunno) and give him double tap Q pls. Viktor just needs small adjustments, Diana might like an Aatrox treatment, same could be said for Leona (her animations are quite old), but it's more likely that they'll get a legendary paired skin with new animations and stuff and maybe small tweaks, they're quite fine as they are.\n\nOh and for major reworks I forgot about {{champion:17}}, he could be so much more it just tilts me that he's the way he is.\n\nHope it helped, nice thread.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Olga Rajecka","date":"2018-04-20T07:34:47.650+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I love your enthusiasm, but Riot doesn't give a flying Zoe about you or anyone in this community.","replies":[]}]}
