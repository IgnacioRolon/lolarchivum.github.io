You lose game 1, but you can keep a good mentality, and then take the next 2 games.\n\nOther than that.......they&#039;re not as bad as everyone is making them out be. Yes, we&#039;ve seen some pro players come out against it, but none of them have yet to give an in depth explanation to how they feel about it.....as far as I&#039;ve seen.\n\nSo, Thank you Darshan for shedding some light on the situation.","replies":[{"poster":"JRobin31","date":"2017-10-11T18:46:37.445+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Great video!  It is heartening, but I'd like to throw a few thoughts out there.\n\n* Quality of Practice: it's one thing for Darshan on CLG to talk about the quality of CLG practice and CLG scrims.  But is he saying the quality of scrims in all NA LCS teams are going to meet that standard?  Competition isn't fostered by having a few teams at the top with high quality practice.  Competition is fostered by having every team in the LCS meeting a high standard.  These are two completely different things.  So I'd ask Darshan to confirm that there will be high quality practice in all teams and not just in CLG.\n\n* Quantity of Competitive Games: LCS games are competitive because they matter more.  There really isn't a replacement for playing more competitive games.  Darshan says that the LCS games are more like a test, so you don't need more tests.  He's right that you don't need more tests, but he's wrong that the LCS games are just tests.  More time on stage in real competitive games is higher quality experience.  It's just not the same to have two players one with a bunch of scrim games and one with a bunch of on stage games.  Objectively, the on stage experience has real value.\n\nSo I hope Darshan is right and that teams really will get high quality practice... (off stage in games where standings aren't at stake).","replies":[{"poster":"BigBellBrute","date":"2017-10-11T20:47:01.079+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=JRobin31,realm=NA,application-id=9hBQwnEU,discussion-id=4sJP39JF,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2017-10-11T18:46:37.445+0000)\n>\n> Great video!

There is no replacement for seat time in games up on stage.   For someone like Darshan, he's been up on stage often enough that it won't probably hurt him.  But someone like uh a rookie.  He needs all the stage time he can get.  \n\nAnd because I just can't resist.   \nWe talkin about practice.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGDBR2L5kzI\n\nLMAO that never gets old.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BigBellBrute","date":"2017-10-10T22:33:59.980+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the best way to get ratings back up is when you show a team is playing at 1pm central, don't wait 3 hours for EU to finish.   Start it.   Personally, I like getting em both in.  But not at the expense of starting NA way late.  I can always look at the Vod's later.  Better yet, if one of them looks like a stomp, I watch the other.   Most aren't going to wait that long before they just forget it and go do something.    Also put more realistic starting times for your games that aren't the first up.    The second best way is to put your best matchups each week during the time more people watch.   Don't throw your #1 vs #2 in the standings up on Friday at 2 pm pacific.  Nobody is going to watch.  If you're having trouble getting in BO3, just go to two games.  But instead of having stupid ties, just count games, not the series.  Do it like baseball does.  They have series all season.  But they don't count series.  They count games.","replies":[{"poster":"JRobin31","date":"2017-10-12T00:31:24.660+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree.  You want more NA viewership?

If Riot wants to make this a viable e\"Sport\" then concurrent games should be expected.  I can't think of ANY other professional league that DOESN'T have multiple matches at the same time. (NFL, NBA, MLB, EPL, NHL, etc)\n\n2) Why are they letting other regions (read: Europe) dictate our scheduling?  I have zero issues with watching Bo3's, what I DO have an issue with?  Tuning in at the listed start time and finding out our matches are delayed because EU is running long.  Start on TIME and you keep better viewers.  If they drop to Bo1's but still start late due to EU overruns, I don't know that I'd bother waiting.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Stillname","date":"2017-10-10T21:37:16.694+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bo1's aren't as good at finding out who is the better team but they do have a ton of advantages.\n\nAnd who says we always have to find out the best team is all the time anyway? I think a 32 team bo1 single elimination tournament would be pretty fun to watch. NCAA Basketball has been doing it for years and tons of people who aren't even interested in basketball get involved in that.\n\nBut yeah the extra practice time you lose going from a bo3 to bo1 should be completely eclipsed by the 80+ hours they put in practicing each week.","replies":[]}]}
