Each time you cast a summoner, you recieve a shard. Once you have 3 of these shards, you are then able to trade them in for a different summoner spell.\n\nJust at first glance, you can tell that there are A METRIC TON of possibilities with this rune, but there are also plenty of problems that arise with it as well. In this thread, I&#039;d like to do my best to list them all off, and give everyone something to brainstorm off of. I&#039;ll be going role by role, explaining what this rune can do in each one.\n\nShall we begin?\n\n-----------\n\n#Top Lane\n\nTo be completely honest, I do not see too many top laners taking this rune. While there could be some cases, you have to remember that people taking this rune are trading off offensive and defensive capability for utility. Carry top laners, like Fiora or Riven, would want something more damage orientated. While tank top laners, like Maokai or Cho&#039;gath would want more survivability. However, there are still some things we can list.\n\n##Pros\n\n * Allows carry top laners to start off with a more lane dominant summoner set up (such as with ignite or exhaust), and the ability to switch to teleport later in the game. This particularly helps split push orientated champs, such as Shen or Nasus.\n\n * Allows top laners to become something akin to a second jungler. If you&#039;re playing a team that has great onjective control, the top laner could switch teleport for smite, and make it nigh impossible for the enemy team to challenge you at objectives.\n\n##Cons\n\n * The &quot;second jungler&quot; aspect could also be a problem. The top laner could start with smite, and while the bot lane is leashing for the actual jungler, the top laner (and potentially mid laner as well), could invade the enemy jungle, and challenge the first buff, potentially wrecking the enemy junglers game all together.\n\n------------\n\n#Jungle\n\nUnlike top lane, I can actually see several cases where junglers take this rune, especially those junglers that struggle with  early clears.\n\n##Pros\n\n * Allows some junglers to start with a summoner set up that allows them to easily clear their first set of camps. For example, taking heal or clarity, then switching it out for flash or ghost. This could also allow some champs that are not normally junglers to actually succeed in the jungle.\n\n * Allows junglers who are good at invading, like Nunu or Shaco, to have a variety of options while counter jungling their opponent, while still being able to have more reliable options later in the game.\n\n * Gives junglers the opportunity to trade out smite for teleport, opening up a very wide range of ganking opportunities. Evelynn and Zac have been notorious for being difficult to track and predict where they would come from for a gank. With this rune, any jungler could have that capability.\n\n * Gives junglers the option of more useful summoners during the later stages of the game when smite becomes less useful, especially when both Baron and Elder Dragon are down.\n\n##Cons\n\n * This problem isn&#039;t entirely aimed at junglers, per se, but more so jungle *items*. This rune allows laners to start with smite, and get the cost efficient jungle items, while still being able to switch out Smite and keeping the jungle items. This could lead us into another &quot;Mid Ezeral Smite&quot; meta with things like Devourer Twitch, or Cinderhulk Top Maokai. This is one of the more glaring problems this rune has, and Riot is aware of it. They have yet to figure out a proper solution, though.\n\n * This rune can allow an entire team to take Smite, and take onjectives *ludicrously* fast. While this is a more extreme case, it is still possible.\n\n--------------------\n\n#Mid Lane\n\nLike top lane, I doubt we will see many mid laners take this rune, since there are simply better options. But...\n\n##Pros\n\n * Allows mid laners to better react to the situation. If tbey are losing lane quite heavily, they can opt into more defensive options, such as heal or barrier. If they are winning, they could opt into ignite or releport. \n\n * Some mid laners could opt into clarity with this rune, making their laning phase much easier, such as Taliyah or Lux.\n\n##Cons\n\n * Could make hard matchups in mid lane even harder, due to the number of options your opponent could have in order to counter you, or shut you down even harder.\n\n * Could make mid lane roams even more impactful than they are now, which would allow mid laners to easily pressure the map in a multitude of ways.\n\n--------------\n\n#Bot Lane\n\nOut of any of the roles, I suspect you&#039;ll see this rune on marksmen the least. They need the damage, and speccing into utility makes them more of a liability than an asset.\n\nIn fact, I suspect that this will be so rare, that I won&#039;t even list off any pros or cons. For if you are to see this on a bot lane marksmen, you&#039;re either being cheesed, or the person is new, and doesn&#039;t know what their doing.\n\n------------\n\n#Support\n\nOut of all of the roles, support is most likely where you will see this rune end up. There are so many things you could do with this rune, its uncanny.\n\n##Pros\n\n * Allows week laning supports, such as Janna or Nami, to opt into summoners that make the lane easier on them, such as clarity or heal, while still having the option to opt into a more reliable mid to late game such as exhaust or ghost.\n\n * Allows lane dominant supports, such as Leona or Alistar, to opt out of aggressive options like ignite, and take things like teleport or exhaust once out of lane.\n\n * Allows high damage supports, like Brand or Zyra, to actually opt into clairvoyance for early vision, that way they can spend their gold on more useful stats in lane.\n\n * Because of supports, this rune could very well make the 2 least used summoners in the game, clarity and clairvoyance, actually viable early game choices. EDIT: MY BAD!!! Completely forgot clairvoyance doesnt exist anymore,  and clarity isn't on SR. Woops.\n\n\n\n * Similar to top laners, supports can also opt into smite, and help with objective control.\n\n##Cons\n\n * Similar to top laners, supports could also become &quot;second unglers&quot;, and challenge, and potentially ruin, the enemy jungler&#039;s day.\n\n--------------\n\nAs you can see, there is ALOT that this rune brings to the table, but it also brings about its own share of problems as well. Remember, that this rune is still in development, and may very well drastically change come preseason.\n\nIf you guys have any questions, I will try my best to answer any and all of them. Otherwise, I hope you enjoyed this, and I&#039;d love to hear any thoughts you guys might have.\n\nElectro","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2017-08-24T01:50:35.149+0000","up_votes":39,"down_votes":3,"body":"Nice write up, your assessment of opportunity cost in particular.

It's reminiscent of one of the things I love about the game SMITE (you pick your summoner spells in game, not pre-game, and you don't get your second one until mid game).\n\nI also think that most of the options seem pretty balanced even without knowing what most of the other runes are.\n\nI agree with your comment further down about possibly needing special interactions for smite.  The option to start smite and invade on the opposite side of mid from where your jungler is starting being at least 'OK' and not overbearing sounds like a serious red flag to me.  Factoring in the chance of the enemy jungler being on that side already or the enemy laners on that side intervening, I'd estimate it's a roughly 30% chance of automatic success (that is, maybe 30% of the time there will be nobody contesting you stealing the buff, since you've got a theoretical 50% chance of the jungler starting there and I see people ward about 40% of the time on the side their jungler isn't starting).  Even if both sides do this, there's still a significant lane advantage to having the buff going into lane (especially if it's blue buff).  If only one side does this, they've got an insane early advantage that can very easily decide the game in the current meta.\n\nAdditionally, I think you should be keeping an eye on interactions with mark on ARAM.
