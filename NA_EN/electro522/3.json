For some reason, the boards are not loading icons for me. At first, I thought it was just my phone (since I first started experiencing it on my phone), but it also doesn't show up on my computer. It isn't just my icon either, it doesn't load nearly anyone's icon.\r\n\r\nAny idea as to what is going on?","replies":[{"poster":"MXXIV","date":"2015-02-09T17:52:34.114+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Downvoting as this is a duplicate post.","replies":[{"poster":"Electro522","date":"2015-02-09T18:02:53.405+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"It is?

In the balance between reposting vs necroing, Boards emphasizes reposting a lot. Which, ofc, results in tons of reposts and duplicate content.\n\nWe (primarily Daen, Sweet, and I) had a conversation in the CommunityPlatform chat room about this a couple weeks back -- the feedback we ended up delivering was basically, that Boards lacks a method for effectively grouping related content.\n\nHere's a mockup I whipped up as one possible way to do that (versioning):\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/QmszMCd.png\n\nYou should totally come to the CommunityPlatform chat room and hang out. We're pretty quiet most of the time, but, with reasonable frequency, we'll break out into some really great conversations. Unfortunately, I'm taking a hiatus from League because I need to get stuff done irl, so I won't be in the chat room, but if you want to add me, I'm still around on the android chat client for 1v1 stuff; I'd be happy to discuss whatever if you want to bounce ideas off someone (or just ping me for early visibility on your posts).","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"MaliceCity","date":"2015-02-09T19:31:29.418+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey everyone, we are having some issues with our Avatar service that we are working through right now.
