I use a laptop, and so when I close my laptop, and I have it go into sleep mode for a second, that fixes it when I open it back up, and log back in. Thing is, the Universe site does it constantly, so I can't even get through a single story without having to do this multiple times.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions on what it might be? Do note that only the Universe site does this.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-03-25T02:50:28.540+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since our Universe page runs some scripts and can sometimes have pop-ups, let's make sure you have any adblockers or other addons that block scripts or pop-ups turned off first.
