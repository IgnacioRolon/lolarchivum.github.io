This generator is to help any aspiring champion concept come to life. It gives you the sex of the champion, what species they are, what role they fill, what kind of damage they deal, and the mechanics of a single ability.\n\nThus, by using what this generator gave me, I came up with an interesting concept of an assassin who lures his targets in; Roh'zix. Unlike most assassins, who try to get to their target by any means necessary, Roh waits for his target to come to him. \n\nThe first iteration of Roh was nicely recieved, although many people said that I implemented the bait wrong, and that he was too similar to Kha'zix. While it was my intention to create a champion similar to Kha, I did not want him to *feel* like Kha. Also, implementing a bait mechanic is difficult just on its own. However, with some help from the community, I believe I have it nailed down.\n\nThus, I give you the new and improved Roh'zix: Seeker of the Void. If you would like to read up on the first iteration, and the conversations that went on, you can do so by clicking [this](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/19PrEx8a-champion-concept-rohzix-seeker-of-the-void).\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n**Roh'zix: Seeker of the Void**\n\n**Role**\nAD/AP Assassin/Fighter\n\n**Inspiration**\nI wanted to make an assassin like no other. An assassin that actually lures his targets in, by setting up a trap, and then wait to see if his target takes the bait.\n\n**Design**\nRoh'zix is an assassin who uses more unconventional methods of taking out his target, setting out a \"bait\" and pouncing if they take it. He can also perform quite well in a duel, having the tools to disable and outsmart his opponent. If used correctly, these tools can be used with devastating effects. One mistake though, and Roh'zix's sub-par defenses will not keep him alive for very long.\n\n**Risk**\nHigh. Roh has to be very smart about when, where, and who he should take out. Despite having the tools to hopefully make it out of a sticky situation alive, they are not very reliable in getting him out of said situations. He also somewhat relies on the decisions made by his enemies in order to carry out his role, which, could backfire on him every now and then.\n\n**Appearance**\nRoh is an older version of Kha'zix, thus, he would look visibly older, with parts of his exoskeleton molting or falling off, a \"red-ish\" hue to his exoskeleton, numerous battle scars, and damaged wings. Roh might be battered and bruised, but his superior experience helps him in any battle.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/REbzuB3.jpg?1\n\nhttp://i.ytimg.com/vi/pyRPDbDmNac/hqdefault.jpg\n\nhttp://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/attachment.php?attachmentid=783124\n\n**Lore**\nI touched lightly on Roh's lore in the previous thread, stating he was an older brother to Kha'zix. However, due to community interaction, I figured that this doesn't fit quite well, given the age separation I had first implemented. I may choose to expand on his lore in a thread solely dedicated to it, for I believe I could flesh out an entire world just from his lore.\n\n**Strengths**\nIncredible assassination potential, long lasting invisibility, can set up traps for his targets, exceptional duelist, strong DoT.\n\n**Weaknesses**\nLow mobility (for an assassin), not very durable, not a very reliable escape, can actually damage himself.\n\n**Plays most like**:{{champion:121}} {{champion:35}} {{champion:56}} \n\n**Auto attack**: Just like Kha's auto attack, a swipe of his large, wing like claws.\n\nhttp://www.hiveworkshop.com/forums/resource_images/11/icons_10789_btn.jpg\n**Passive - Seeker's Intent**: From studying the Xer'sai before they were banished from the Void, Roh'zix has fine tuned his hearing to listen very closely to his targets. Roh'zix is able to determine the direction a champion is in when they cast an ability (this does not work for toggled abilities, or passive abilities). However, the farther away Roh'zix is from the location of the cast ability, the harder it is for him to determine its direction.\n\n**Design**: If you happen to read my first iteration of Roh, his old passive was his core bait mechanic, however, it turned out to be too complex to be a passive ability. Thus, I had to completely rethink his passive. I tried pulling inspiration from several different sources, and eventually went into his lore. As stated earlier, I will probably expand more on this, but Roh is quite old, and seen plenty of adversaries. Due to his age, he would of probably gotten the idea to evolve himself by using tricks he learned from studying the other species of the Void. Since Rek'sai has the capability to track her targets, why shouldn't Roh? That being said, Roh's tracking ability is nowhere near as reliable as Rek's, since she relies on enemy movement to track her targets, and Roh uses sound.\n\n\nhttp://www.hiveworkshop.com/forums/resource_images/15/icons_14202_btn.jpg\n**Q - Heated Claws**: *Toggle* From studying the Cos'maw, Roh'zix is able to create a chemical reaction inside his claws which rapidly heats them up, allowing his auto attacks to deal extra physical damage. However, this reaction makes his claws hot enough that his claws will actually become painful, damaging himself more and more until he finally stops the reaction.\n\n**Evolved Q - Fire Claws**: Roh'zix discovers a new component to the reaction which allows his claws to be set on fire, heating them far more quickly, and burning whoever he autoattacks for a short duration.\n\n**Design**: In the first iteration, I wanted Roh's Q to have some sort of damage over time mechanic. Once I decided that he could have the same evolution mechanic that Kha has, it was easy to out the DoT on his evolved Q, which is basically just an autoattack buff that gets more powerful the longer you leave it active. However, I did have to make some sort of mechanic that would counteract people wanting to leave it on the entire, essentially giving him infinite damage. Roh still has the potential to hit that infinite damage mark, but he may not live to see it, since after a short delay of leaving the ability on, Roh will start take more and more damage the longer this ability is active. I imagine that managing this resource would be just like managing Rumble's heat; you want that extra damage, but you don't want to damage yourself. \n\nOh yeah, and it would deal percent max health true damage to him, that way there will be no way to build against it.\n\n\nhttp://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/4.21.5/img/spell/KhazixR.png\n**W - Dusty Carapace**: Roh'zix creates a temporary, controlable, non-damaging clone of himself that grants him invisibility when within range of the clone. If Roh is to step outside of range of the clone, the invisibility will last for a short duration before dissipating. If Roh is ever to cast an ability while inside the range of the clone, the invisibility will immediately be removed, and the clone will collapse.\n\nIf an enemy champion is to deal any kind of damage to the clone, the clone will explode into a cloud of dust, blinding that champion, and greatly reducing their vision range for a short duration(imagine dust getting into your eyes). Only one champion can be blinded per ability cast. Once the clone explodes, Roh's invisibility will immediately be removed, but he can step inside the cloud left behind to gain a small, short lasting armor and magic resistance buff.\n\nIf the clone is to not take any damage, it will simply collapse into a pile of dust. Roh's invisibility will last for a short duration after the clone has collapsed.\n\n**Evolved W - Very Dusty Carapace** Roh'zix's clone is able to blind more then one champion in a small area around the initial champion, and the armor and magic resistance buff is doubled.\n\n**Design**: This is Roh's core mechanic. Now, before any of you go off saying that this sounds more like an ultimate, complex abilities do not have to be ultimates. Look at Azir's W. In some ways his W is far more complex then his ultimate. However, I did deliberately make this ability deal no damage since it isn't an ultimate. Besides, we already have a damaging clone ultimate for Shaco, we don't need another.\n\nI wanted to make an assassin that baits people in, and well, this is his bait. Enemies would not be able to tell if the Roh coming at them is real or fake (with the two other controlable clones in the game, there are ways to tell who is real, and who is fake), thus, they would have to make the decision of trying to stop him. If he's real, he's dead, or just simply slowed down. If he's fake, they will be left in their own realm of isolation for a short amount of time. Think of how terrifying that would be, seeing this entity dash past you, but not being able to see it. Like something straight out of a horror movie, right?\n\nhttp://www.hiveworkshop.com/forums/resource_images/16/icons_15721_btn.jpg\n**E - Void Dash**: Roh'zix uses his old and damaged wings to push him towards a target champion, dashing past them a set distance, and dealing a percentage of their max health in magic damage. Once finished, the target champion takes increased physical damage from Roh's autoattacks.\n\n**Evolved E - Superior Void Dash**: Roh'zix uses his old and damaged wings to push him towards a target champion, dashing past them a set distance, and dealing a percentage of their max health in magic damage. Once cast, this ability can be cast again on the same target for a short duration, dealing the same amount of max health damage, and slowing the target. Once finished, the target champion takes increased physical and magic damage from Roh's autoattacks.\n\n**Design**: This ability, once evolved, is basically a combination of Renekton and Yasuo's E. Since Roh is an assassin, I wanted to give him some mobility, but not enough to where it counteracts his core theme of being an older, and less mobile version of Kha. Also, this ability is what came from Lutzburg's champion generator, dealing the percent health damage, and the slow, in somewhat of an odd fashion.\n\nThis is the only ability that I will not touch up on. Out of all of the other abilities, I feel this ability is quite well designed, despite it coming from a random champion generator (No offense to Lutzburg here. Roh'zix wouldn't exists without the creation of this ability)\n\n\nhttp://www.hiveworkshop.com/forums/resource_images/16/icons_15627_btn.jpg\n**R - Void Scar**: \n*Passive*: Roh'zix is able to evolve his abilities each time this ability ranks up. Evolved abilities will have bonus effects.\n\n*Active*: From studying and discussing with the Bou'koz, Roh'zix is able to create a small rift to the void *inside* a target enemy champion. After a short delay, this rift explodes, dealing a massive amount of magic damage to the target, and stunning them for a very short duration.\n\n**Evolved R - Void Nova**: Roh'zix creates a small rift to the void *inside* a target enemy champion. After a short delay, this rift explodes, dealing a massive amount of magic damage to the target, stunning them for a short duration, and slowing them afterwards. This explosion is strong enough that it creates other, smaller rifts in surrounding enemy champions, which, after a delay, explode, dealing half of the initial explosion's damage in physical damage, and slowing the affected champions for a small amount and a short duration.\n\n**Design**: You could say that this is similar to Varus' ultimate, but his is a skillshot, and snares the target enemy champ on contact. Plus, his ult deals a pathetic amount of damage compared to this. Assassins are meant to basically delete enemies off of the field. While Roh's other abilities can certainly help him do this, this ability simply solidifies that fact. The evolved version also gives him a bit of teamfighting capability, since it has the potential to damage all of the enemy team. Albeit, you'll have to get pretty close to the target, and hope that they stay within range of the explosion.\n\nOK, I lied, there are *two* abilities I won't touch up on. This is another ability that is actually quite well designed, and does give Roh some teamfighting potential besides just being able to blind the entire enemy team (if they are closely packed together). I was thinking of making this a skillshot nuke, that way I could somehow keep the spike missiles from the first iteration (many people told me to throw it out), but felt it would be a bit too overpowered there, and thus kept it to where Roh has to get close to his target in order to apply the nuke.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nAnd there you have it folks! My redesigned champion concept that came from something that a random champion generator gave me. I would like to thank Lutzburg for making it, making his other champion concepts which helped inspire this, and giving his advice on the first iteration. I would also like to thank anyone else who helped brainstorm this guy into existence.\n\nAlso, if you may have noticed, I did use Lutzburgs format for making this concept. His format is very well organized, and helps explain the champion very well. So, thanks again Lutz!\n\nFeel free to tell me what you think!","replies":[{"poster":"DreamsGoneMad","date":"2015-01-05T20:04:15.194+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think you misunderstood what I was implying the last time.\nAccording to what you said, Roh'Zix is an older, more knowledgeable version of Kha'Zix. Kha'Zix is younger and always changing. From my perspective, both of these facts mean Roh should not have an evolving mechanic in his kit. That piece is Kha's core identity, Roh should seem more like the apex, or what Kha desires to be. \nI suggest selecting either the standard or evolved versions of the abilities, and leave them in that state. Or, select a balance between the two. My point is, he shouldn't be evolving if he's in his prime/twilight years.","replies":[{"poster":"Electro522","date":"2015-01-05T20:55:16.263+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah, OK.

Plus, it does not tell the direction of the spell, it tells the direction of the champion.\n\nAlso, if it was to refresh the duration of his E, his E would be up nearly all of the time, and never be on colldown. That's a bit OP in my eyes.\n\nWhen I said \"blind\" I meant that they are blinded in a figurative sense. They ability really only reduces their vision. I guess I should have clarified on this.","replies":[{"poster":"Invite him","date":"2015-01-05T18:33:13.439+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You probably didnt understand me, and you say that it sounded op, let me tell you a full Passive and how it looks like\n\nPassive: *Every time, a near by enemy casts an ability, Roh'Zix senses the ability, gaining vision of all enemy champions that are near him and his E's cooldown is refreshed! Additionally, Roh'Zix's revealed enemy champion/champions are marked with **Predator's Sense***!\n***Predator's Sense** : *Abilities against an enemy champion/champions, that are marked, will deal 5/10/15 % bonus magic damage*!\n\n***Explanation***\n*When an enemy uses an ability, Roh'Zix senses every enemy near him in a range, around like Rek'Sai's **Tremor sense*** *and he refreshes his E's cooldown.*\n*If the enemy champion is still within the range of his sense, they will remain revealed and marked, the only way to get stealth in the fog of war is to get out of Roh'Zix's sense range!*\n*If a new enemy champion enters his sense range, as ive said earlier he reveals all champions, this champion that has new-ly entered the range, will be revealed too, but will not refresh his E's cooldown!* \n*When all the enemy champions get out of the sense range, they will be not revealed anymore, but if they entered it again, casting an ability will reveal them again and Roh'Zix's E will be refreshed again!*\n\n*So basically, when an enemy cast his q/w/e/r near you, youll gain vision of them and youll mark them with **Predator's Sense**, and the cooldown of you E will refresh, if more enemy champions enter your sense range, once somebody activated it, they will be revealed too, but will not reset your E's cooldown, if all enemy champions THAT HAVE BEEN MARKED/REVEALED get out of Roh'Zix's sense range, they wont be revealed any longer, but casting an ability near Roh'Zix will do the same things again!*\n\nHopefully now youve understood me, i hope that i dont interfere, because i love your concept, these changes will make it better, so please consider! Anyways, do not hate me, because im writing everything to help you, ive created a lot of champions, ill still create more, so i feel that it will be good to land my knowledge over people that have a great, even awesome concepts, but in-which they just have to be tuned a little bit!
