Please make sure your video card is using the latest video drivers from the manufacturer.\"\r\n\r\nThing is.....they are up to date. I even have an updater that isn't from the manufacturer that did additional updates. Once I press OK, I'm sent to the \"Reconnect\" screen, and when I click the reconnect button, I get the same pop-up.\r\n\r\nSo........can I get a little help?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-29T04:33:25.564+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmm I wonder if this could be more permissions related, more of a case where the drivers are updated correctly but for some reason your pc or League isn't able to use them? Let's first double check juuuust to be sure your graphics card *and* DirectX drivers are fully updated (and updated with admin rights of course). After that, double check that League has all the permissions it's needs to run using the [**permissions guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) if needed. \n\nBe sure to hit me back up if this doesn't help, we may need to take a closer look at some of your game logs to figure out what's going wrong.","replies":[{"poster":"Electro522","date":"2017-11-29T14:17:12.097+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I actually was able to *kind of* figure it out. A Microsoft \"Fall Creators Update\" came out awhile ago, which, for some reason, screwed up Nvidia's GeForce drivers. Ever since then, they've been updating the drivers, and, apparently, one of their more recent updates was meant to improve the performance of both Battlefront 2 and Destiny 2. However.....this update seems to have done the exact opposite. There seems to be some kind of bug that doesn't make the drivers install after a reboot, and (for me at least), the installation process of these drivers crashes my computer time and time again, forcing automatic reboots, or manual ones.\n\nHow does this relate to League? Well, once I finished the \"Fall Creators Update\".......I had no drivers to speak of, not even standard Windows drivers. So, no game could run *at all*, including League. I reverted the Windows update, and, due to it's God tier optimization, League does run. I also have some other lower tier games that run just fine as well, but for the big, AAA, graphics heavy games, Like Assassin's Creed Origins, and Destiny 2, I need the drivers from Nvidia, and I can't go back to an earlier build for the drivers. So, I'm stuck with having no drivers until this is potentially fixed.\n\nI spent all damn day yesterday battling my computer, and, I think it's needless to say, I wasn't in a very good mood.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-30T03:35:25.110+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeeeaaaa it sounds like there's some really weird stuff going on with those drivers since you got the Creators Update. If you haven't been able to those drivers working properly do me a favor and send our tech agents your game logs using the [**Hextech Repair Tool**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367-Automated-Troubleshooting-Hextech-Repair-Tool).
