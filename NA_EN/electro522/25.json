Why?\r\n\r\nBecause I doubt we&#039;ll see a new skin after this for Ahri for quite some time. I suspect a minimum of 2 years. I know this might be difficult to believe, especially now, but look back on the patterns of releases for skins in the past.\r\n\r\nNormally, when Riot makes a really high quality skin, such as a Legendary, they tend to step away from making skins for that champ for quite awhile.\r\n\r\nExamples: Master Yi, Ashe, Rumble, Sion, Sona, Nocturne, and Cho&#039;gath; just to name the more obvious ones.\r\n\r\nOf course, I can&#039;t speak for Riot, for I don&#039;t know what they&#039;re plans are. But, I can say that I am 90% sure that Star Gaurdian Ahri will be the last Ahri skin we see for a really long time, not only due it being a Legendary, but also due to the sudden outcry over the reveal.","replies":[{"poster":"Rismosch","date":"2017-08-08T22:12:16.637+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Electro522","date":"2017-08-08T22:20:02.933+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm not denying that, but we have strong reasons to believe otherwise.\n\nThey won't leave her in the dust after this for as long others, but I'm certain they'll step away from her for at least one extra year.","replies":[{"poster":"MuffledGarbage","date":"2017-08-09T05:31:03.577+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"they've already announced pool party {{champion:103}}  coming in next summer...\n\nRiot can't ever give skins to my boi {{champion:83}} because that's too much work but making 20 more skins for {{champion:103}} is perfectly fine...\n\n\nImma leave league if there isn't a {{champion:83}} skin in 2017 like riot announced.","replies":[{"poster":"zaire90","date":"2017-08-09T05:36:48.793+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MuffledGarbage,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=OpwAQVbY,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2017-08-09T05:31:03.577+0000)\n>\n> they&#x27;ve already announced pool party {{champion:103}}  coming in next summer...\n> \n\nProof or it didnt happen","replies":[{"poster":"MuffledGarbage","date":"2017-08-09T06:10:10.759+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"https://mapskins.com/2017/05/23/pool-party-ahri/\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AhriMains/comments/6d57uh/pool_party_ahri_leaked/\n\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/story-art/E7mOieG3-that-leak-is-fake-confirmed-by-a-rioter?comment=001100020000\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AhriMains/comments/6d5hoy/pool_party_ahri_skin_league_of_legends/\n\nRiot also denied leaks from a while ago which correctly predicted the Zac moveset in the tank update and omega squad fizz.\n\n\nThe leak is most likely real due to the lack of truth when riot has talked about leaks in the past.\n\nEDIT:\nYou owe me either 10 boxes of cookies or a  20 paragraph essay on how great {{champion:83}} is with 50 sentences per paragraph.","replies":[{"poster":"Electro522","date":"2017-08-09T06:24:38.811+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Where do you see \"Pool Party Ahri announced\" in any of that? \n\nThese are months old posts that go off of nothing but rumors, and fan art. Riot would also never EVER announce something like this a whole _year_ before its release. If they do that, they run into another Ao Shin dilemma, where hype builds up so damn much, that it eventually becomes impossible for them to deliver on said hype, disappointing the majority of the player base in the end.\n\nThis is exactly why you never see any announcements from Riot more than 6 months in advance, and if it's for a skin, the only time you will see them before they get on the PBE is if they're leaked, of which, all leaks must be taken with a grain of salt. Sometimes their right, sometimes their wrong, you can never know.\n\nEDIT: That leak was made before 7.12, and \"announced\" a new champ which _might_ be in production, but if he was meant to come after Kayn, or, even _be_ Kayn, it was completely wrong.\n\nAlso, the leak happened when Star Guardian Ahri should have been in production. It is a legendary skin, so, that means they probably started working on it around January/February, if not earlier.\n\nI will admit that Urgot was fairly close, and recent hints say that the Evelynn leak could also be kind of close.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Lõyalty","date":"2017-08-08T22:14:29.232+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"You could release pool party ahri in a month as a ultimate skin and people would still buy it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RainXBlade","date":"2017-08-09T03:57:22.954+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pardon me, but the first thing I noticed in your post is that you misspelled \"Guardian\" in the title of your post.\nhttp://holdinholden.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/gpo.png\n######Please no downvote....","replies":[]},{"poster":"One Ashe On","date":"2017-08-08T22:22:15.828+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":10,"body":"It leave me a bit bittersweet because, Lux is the former skin and it got outshined pretty hard by most of those skin..
