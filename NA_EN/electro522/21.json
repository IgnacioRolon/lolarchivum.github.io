As an Immortals fan, it would be sad to see the team I've been cheering on since they started and really get me into watching e-sports vanish over lack of stable funding, but it is a major reality of this franchise system. \n\nYes teams will get the stability they've been demanding, yes, the system is being switched to a Bo1 so teams can have a bit easier time to build dedicated fan bases through marketing and viewership. But if there is a significant risk of a team suddenly collapsing and leaving things unfunded, then I can understand that being of concern to being given a franchise spot.  Just wish/hope there would be more transparency and information on all this, so everyone understands what happened.","replies":[{"poster":"Mazariamonti","date":"2017-10-19T01:15:20.122+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Agree with you there.
