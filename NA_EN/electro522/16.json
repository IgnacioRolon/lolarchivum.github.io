No matter who I play, I am one tough cookie.\r\n\r\nBut Ignite kind of throws all of that out the window.\r\n\r\nIt provides exceptional dueling power, keeps tanks and literally AYNONE with sustain in check, and can almost always secure a kill.\r\n\r\nFor those who don't know, there was a time when Exhaust {{summoner:3}} was taken on almost everyone for similar reasons. It reduced the attack speed of who it was on, and also reduced their resistances. While Exhaust was on anyone that wasn't a fed burst mage or assassin, they were effectively useless during it's duration, and could easily be killed.\r\n\r\nGranted, Ignite isn't like what Exhaust used to be, but it's damn near close. Yes, it's getting nerfed in the next patch, but I don't think that that'll be enough.\r\n\r\nAs of right now, these are the current changes to Ignite on the PBE:\r\n\r\n* Damage lowered from [80-505 (55+25 per Lvl)] to [70-410 (50+20 per Lvl)]\r\n* Cooldown lowered from 210 to 180\r\n\r\nYes, the damage is lower across the Board, but not by much. Also, reducing the CD on Ignite may turn this into an overall buff, since Ignite will do more consistent damage throughout the game.\r\n\r\nIf I were to suggest anything, I'd say to just straight out nerf the damage, and keep the CD the same, or nerf the damage even more (maybe to 40+20 per level). \r\n######Side note: It currently says (40+20 per lvl) on Surrender@20. I believe this is typo due to the pictures provided.\r\n\r\nThat, or maybe *extend* it's duration while doing the same amount of total damage? That way, a health pot ticking is stronger against the burn.","replies":[{"poster":"Naalith","date":"2019-01-15T23:18:33.642+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":1,"body":"Summoners are in such a weird place right now. I'm not sure if the game has just been solved at this point but people used to take really diverse stuff depending on the situation, now mid lane is really the only place you can swap your spells out.\n\nFlash {{summoner:4}}  remains and probably will always be required, even though my friends and I used to say they should remove it in the early days of League that won't happen now and honestly it's the only saving grace in the current meta for non-mobile champions to attempt to not die.\n\nTeleport {{summoner:12}} pisses me off because it's basically required top. Top is super fun in my opinion when both people take ignite and actually have a penalty for death, but with teleport they can just come back instantly before you can get your minions to die in their tower. If you take ignite against a teleport, you'll end up behind no matter how many times you clap them. Teleport is also a requirement in high elo/pro play and honestly I'm not sure how I feel about it being in the game.\n\n{{summoner:3}} is so bad right now that even enchanters and other such supports don't take it now and just run ignite instead since everyone dies instantly no matter what.\n\n{{summoner:21}} exists. Idk what else to say lol. Mids take it if they're going against an assassin in the hope that it saves them. It won't but... you know, it's the thought that counts.\n\n{{summoner:7}} probably the most balanced summoner spell? It's tailor made for bot lane and will probably stay there forever.\n\n{{summoner:14}} basically the standard because it assists in killing people instantly, or snowballing yourself by doing the last few ticks of damage (so you can then snowball and kill people instantly)\n\n{{summoner:1}} I'm not sure anyone knows this spell exists, I see it like once a month.

Ignite being buffed was one of the common suggestions as it was also beneficial to assassins, who were really fucking bad at the time. This was preferred by high elos since they're not allergic to adding any form of damage to the game. Other common suggestions included nerfing Ardent (which happened) and nerfing ADCs so they're no longer mandatory (which, again, happened).\n\nAnd like I said, it doesn't matter how many different opinions occupy boards when >95% of the opinions are trash and think we need to nerf Zed.","replies":[{"poster":"flibitydoo","date":"2019-01-16T04:34:13.390+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"actually it's not that hard.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/NUXsJss.png[/img]\n\njust type it into a search bar and you'll get every instance of someone mentioning \"ignite\" and \"buff\" in the same post.\n\nturns out this one guy made a post 2 years ago asking for ignite buffs\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/0Q7BqW0.png[/img]\n\nhe got downvoted though for his post.\nThe points be brings up are very true for the time though, like 2 years ago (when it was posted) they made it so tp'ing to a tower shaved a full minute off it's cooldown which made it very safe for laners to play. And they buffed exhaust to shred resists which also made it really strong.\n\nevery other post though you look at in those search results is just \"nerf ignite\" or \"it does too much damage\" (or it's \"buff my main champion\" where the search algorithm ignored the word ignite and only looked up the word buff).\n\nI managed to find 2 that mentioned \"buffing ignite\"\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/cL3SoJK.png[/img]\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/f5UJMJs.png[/img]\n\n... these are both made 3 years ago so it won't match the criteria of \"within the past 2 seasons\" that the guy you were replying to wanted.

If I'm up against a panth or Darius or something, shouldn't an option be to bring to and play for later to counteract some of their likely early aggression?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"FCJAAAAGOOOO","date":"2019-01-16T19:29:42.233+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay keep in mind though?\n\nKeep in mind though.\n\nThat is 95 TRUE damage.\n\nTo tanks or anyone stacking resistances that is literally 300+ effective health to them.\n\nTo tanks or anyone else stacking resistances that is literally 600+ effective health to them against back-to-back Ignites which happens all the time at 210 cooldown anyway.\n\nIt basically got the Scorch treatment of a lower cooldown at the cost of there being much less burst damage in the game in general.  I for one could not be happier.  More people will NOT run Ignite and will run other defense/utility summoners now, thank goodness.  More Barriers/Ghosts/Heals/Cleanses can only be good for this deathball meta.\n\nI will play again if this goes live and nothing else in the patch notes ruins it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wild Geese","date":"2019-01-16T16:05:08.307+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So am I, it's not even that good.\nI got Nasus down to 50 Hp and ignited him and he lived by autoattacking twice with half lifesteal.\n\nLol, it's a pretty trash summoner to be honest.

It would be really cool to see more diversity with summs, and even if they nerf ignite more than they are planning, I don't see the reason people wouldn't prefer having free 150 true damage with grievous wounds over anything else, aside from having mandatory heal or tp for certain champions. \n\nAlso, it's worth to mention that ignite is -and I'm sure I'm being pretty objective with this-, a really tilting summoner both if you're losing to someone with it and/or losing with it as it becomes useless af.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CaliCoastReplay","date":"2019-01-16T13:28:05.347+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thinking about it more - making it a skillshot with a very small AOE radius, in which the damage is maximized in the middle but really pretty awful at the edges, would feel very balancing for {{summoner:14}} in my opinion.\n\nPersonally, I love it when I see {{summoner:14}} up in the toplane on my opponents.  It's a greedy strat that is highly punishable and 75% of the time or better I just force those people out, and without {{summoner:12}} they lose 1-2 waves on a forceout and usually just lose the lane hardcore after that.  It's not *that* broken - but I do agree that the point-and-click nature can make it feel very uninteractive and un-fun to play against, particularly during ganks.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Heos00","date":"2019-01-16T04:37:17.271+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It should have the same heal reduction but for shields too and lower the damage a bit more, with that nerf it still can outdamage or have the same damge of a maxed ability of any champion in early and mid game just like now while being on click and having true damage lmfao...","replies":[]}]}
