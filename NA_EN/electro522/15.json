However, on Reddit, there was one comment line talking about how assassins may have more time to actually kill their target before being bursted down by the ADC (around 1 to 2 seconds.......which is a VERY long time in League). However, that line ended with a comment saying &quot;God Bless Lulu.&quot;\r\n\r\nAnd that made me realize.....all these changes not only make assassins better, but also, in turn, make shielding supports better. If these changes go through......not much may change except for which support is taken. We may very well not fall into the World&#039;s Ardent meta again, but the strong scaling ADCs we have today may still stick around due to having a &quot;get-out-of-jail-free-card&quot; in their back pocket.\r\n\r\nTake Janna for example. All of these changes could be indirect buffs for her, since she has notoriously been a &quot;mid to late game support&quot;. Her laning sucks.....ALOT, but once you start getting into teamfights is where she truly starts to shine. According to the changes, ADCs will &quot;turn on&quot; later in the game.......right where Janna wants to be. Pair her with a Twitch or Tristana, and, well......we&#039;re right back to where we are now, just slightly later in the game.\r\n\r\nJust my 2 cents......I guess we&#039;ll just have to wait and see.","replies":[{"poster":"jocomotion","date":"2018-05-01T01:49:35.099+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":6,"body":"If they want to push other champions bot lane they could....\nMake {{champion:40}} shield give AD AND AP, but less of each than currently, Make {{champion:117}} shield weaker but make pix’s damage buff stronger.

As a Lulu main, you likely know far better than I do that she's actually a really versatile champion with a ton of offensive effects (in fact, her combination of offense and utility is what allowed her to solo lane), yet since the introduction of the healing/shielding stat she's been relegated to the same spot as Janna, where she exists purely to save the marksman's life, shut down incoming assassins and divers, and otherwise do little else. Moreover, Lulu as a champion has immense potential to synergize with melee allies, due to her bonus health/size/slow aura on ult and increased movement speed buff on W, but her ult has ended up being treated as a pure heal, whereas her W was changed by Riot themselves to synergize primarily with marksmen.\n\nBecause of this, while I agree shields and heals need to be pared down significantly overall, I think enchanters should also have their offensive playmaking abilities buffed and valued more in compensation. Ideally, \"offensive playmaking\" should not necessarily mean more damage, as was the case with Janna's horrendous mini-rework, but should involve the ability to enhance the offensive potential of allies, as well as set targets up with CC. Nami is a popular champion precisely because she has such a great balance between her capabilities for both offensive and defensive plays, and I think even the most defensive of supports could opt into this as well. Having support items that encouraged offensive plays, namely by rewarding offensive power and synergizing with setups, instead of the current selection that offers almost exclusively defensive effects like heals and shields, could go a long way towards allowing enchanters to thrive, without having to exist purely as a provider of extra health bars and items for only one champion on their whole team.","replies":[{"poster":"ChaddyFantome","date":"2018-05-02T01:24:55.281+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Teridax68,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=c5OfQJNX,comment-id=00020001,timestamp=2018-05-01T02:56:22.686+0000)\n>\n> Personally, I feel the issue with the support changes over recent times is that they&#x27;ve focused exclusively on increasing their defenses, to the detriment of everything else. \n\nEh, idk if i agree with that. generally Enchanters are overpowered is specifically WHEN they become to offensively efficient.\nJanna's reign recently in particular was due to Summon Aery giving her a lot of free poke damage for example.\n\n\n\n>As a Lulu main, you likely know far better than I do that she&#x27;s actually a really versatile champion with a ton of offensive effects (in fact, her combination of offense and utility is what allowed her to solo lane), yet since the introduction of the healing/shielding stat she&#x27;s been relegated to the same spot as Janna, where she exists purely to save the marksman&#x27;s life, shut down incoming assassins and divers, and otherwise do little else.\n\nThat's not true at all.

And this is largely why these items were introduced in the first place. Before this, after the Season 4 changes to Supports, enchanters were strictly better as solo laners than supports, because they simply scaled better off AP, a stat they couldn't afford to actually obtain as a support, especially back then.\n\nThen they were repeatedly nerfed outta solo lanes.\n\nWhile I am not opposed to Enchanters having more damaging power inherently, i don't really think it is healthy for the game as opposed to the paradigm we have now where you focus on one or the other, because otherwise you just get a champion with all the boons at no cost.\n\n\n\n>Ideally, &quot;offensive playmaking&quot; should not necessarily mean more damage, as was the case with Janna&#x27;s horrendous mini-rework, but should involve the ability to enhance the offensive potential of allies, as well as set targets up with CC. \n\n\nOh?

A steroid that gives movement speed when moving towards enemies, for example, is a form of offensive utility. I agree that most crowd control can be used both offensively and defensively (though even then, that differs from healing and shielding), but one can still find plenty of ways to bias that CC towards offense: for example, Ivern's root is more offensive because it gives champions a free dash to the rooted target, and Leona's CC tends to be more offensive because it marks targets for bonus damage. By contrast, Janna's CC tends to be more defensive, because her displacement originates from her location, and tends to be more difficult to dodge for opponents moving directly towards her or a nearby ally, while only much more rarely being good at making picks. In view of this, I'd support making crowd control on some supports more offensively-oriented via these kinds of effects, or by giving them items that would similarly enable better offense using this kind of utility or CC (for example, an item that caused your hard CC to temporarily reduce the target's resists).\n\n > [{quoted}](name=ChaddyFantome,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=c5OfQJNX,comment-id=000200010000,timestamp=2018-05-02T01:24:55.281+0000)\n>\n> {{item:3504}} {{item:3905}} {{item:2065}} {{item:3174}} all encourage and reward offensive play and playmaking.\n\nArdent is an item that primarily operates through heals and shields, while also boosting them, so even though its effects are offensive, it still contributes to the excessive amount of healing and shielding we have now, even without the ridiculous sustain it used to have. Similarly, Athene's provides healing. Athenes, Twin Shadows and Shurelya's are also all far less popular than the current Ardent + Redemption + Locket combo, a combo picked by all enchanters in spite of Locket's frequent changes to make it less attractive to squishier users. For sure, we have some offensive support items, or at least some support items that can be used offensively, but currently the most prominent and popular support items contribute to a very protection-oriented build. The fact that it's picked even on supports intended to be more offensive is evidence enough that that kind of build is far too strong, or at least that builds with more offensive utility aren't nearly as popular by comparison.

Lulu doesn't really HAVE any offensive utility outside of buffing/enabling her allies with the ability to better perform offensively, which i personally don't have a problem with, but i digress.\n\nAs i mentioned before, Lulu used to be more poke oriented, but that was largely just in lane phase.\nAfter that, she was largely considered an inferior Janna actually. I don't think that really ever was completely true tho, especially nowadays.\n\nAs for Solo Lane Lulu, changing her W isn't what is gonna make or break her solo lane. not even by a long shot.\nHer E being Point and Click largely is, as it provides undodgeable poke and a setup for her Q that while not truly uninteractive (there is a mind game involved with dodging it via your character movement) is still rather one sides.\n\nPersonally, I don't find bringing Solo lane Lulu back to be of any remote priority to begin with. I still have nightmares of the never ending stream of nerfs to her after I started spamming that back in late Season3 and throughout season 4....\nI don't really think it is worth changing her just to do, but i digress.\n\n\n> &quot;Offensive CC&quot; what do you mean by that?\n> Because generally, all types of CC can be used both offensively and defensively.\n> \n> It is indeed usually difficult to discern the meaning of a point when one stops right in the middle of it.

I wouldn't be too keen on essentially making it so enchanters can all be more like morganna with her 3 second Q as it were. that is a whole other can frustrating by itself.\n\nWhatsmore is i feel the delineation between Enchanters and Catchers becomes blurred as a result.\n \n> Ardent is an item that primarily operates through heals and shields, while also boosting them, so even though its effects are offensive, it still contributes to the excessive amount of healing and shielding we have now, even without the ridiculous sustain it used to have. \n\nI mean, sure, but it is still biased in favor of offense no? Similar to your previous examples? I don't see how it operating through said means invalidates that. \n\n>Similarly, Athene&#x27;s provides healing.\n\nBut it only provides said healing by means of reward for offensive play. Athenes also provides AP for Mana-regen, which increases the potency of enchanters Utility on their spells.\n\n>Athenes, Twin Shadows and Shurelya&#x27;s are also all far less popular than the current Ardent + Redemption + Locket combo, a combo picked by all enchanters in spite of Locket&#x27;s frequent changes to make it less attractive to squishier users.\n\nLocket+Redemption combo is actually not all that common anymore, nor is it all that potent on Enchanters specifically.\nIve had more success with it on Tankier supports who actually build HP myself.\n\nThe reason it still gets use is because the item itself is just to reliable stat check and always has been.\nTo my knowledge, Riot was playing with Changes to rework the item all together, so i wouldn't preoccupy myself with the item too much.\n\nIn any case, Athenes is honestly very underrated imho.

Enchanters themselves are often quite fragile and bring relatively low damage to the table, meaning they really only shine when grouped together with others.\n\nSo, as a matter of fact, augmenting the potency of allies is put on equal footing with protection. This is also putting aside how these class definitions are retroactive and can easily be subject to change depending on the class's health. \n\n> [{quoted}](name=ChaddyFantome,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=c5OfQJNX,comment-id=00020001000000000000,timestamp=2018-05-03T00:14:46.088+0000)\n>\n> The reason protection oriented items have historically, (yes, historically, even before Forbidden idol items) been the most effective on them is because these items actually help these champions do what they are trying to do primarily.\n\nActually, offensive supports, including mages and vanguards, have frequently been the dominant subgroup in bot lane, during times where support-based protection wasn't as plentiful. Also, which non-protection items are we talking about here? When exactly have support items not focused on protection? It's easy to say protection items have always been dominant when they have essentially been the only kind of itemization allowed on supports.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=ChaddyFantome,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=c5OfQJNX,comment-id=00020001000000000000,timestamp=2018-05-03T00:14:46.088+0000)\n> \n> While I don&#x27;t think adding additional options in the spirit of giving these champions more build options, I don&#x27;t think steering them away from performing their primary function is exactly what the intent should be.\n\nAlright then, let's just flatly nerf supports instead and call it a day. Because that is the only alternative here: at the end of the day, supports output too many defenses, and regardless of whether or not that is their \"intent\", that is unhealthy to the game. What I am proposing here is to avoid this kind of situation by _shifting_ power from defense to offense, instead of simply _removing_ it. Enchanters simply cannot remain in this current state where they output huge amounts of defenses with perfect reliability, so they will inevitably need to have that power reduced, as Riot themselves mentioned in their own recent design thoughts. Whether or not you want them to have better offensive power in compensation is up to you.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=ChaddyFantome,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=c5OfQJNX,comment-id=000200010000000000000000,timestamp=2018-05-03T00:22:18.773+0000)\n>\n> Its again, largely because there aren&#x27;t really any good options for your kind of idea that actually synergises with the champions kits.\n> I looked up Bard, and apparently Twin Shadows is popular on him, which makes sense with his roam focused playstyle and the fact he benefits from the MS. \n\n... so you just provided an example of a support synergizing with a non-defensive item.

Increasing slow values tends to be kind a meh, and increasing the duration of CC is a complete no-no. Beyond that, there may be something that could be done with scalings on stat steroids, debuffs, etc., but I agree that it is difficult to implement stat-based power on a class that is fundamentally not designed to require that many stats to function.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Teridax68","date":"2018-05-03T03:37:44.429+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ChaddyFantome,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=c5OfQJNX,comment-id=00020001000000000000,timestamp=2018-05-03T00:14:46.088+0000)\n>\n> Yea, I was working off of my phone.

As I've said before on this board, shields, unlike heals have no use outside of combat, since a shield is only as useful as the damage is successfully blocks., whereas healing can be performs in the neutral. a Shield pierce item wouldn't promote the same gameplay pattern that GW does, where it encourages you not _letting_ the healer stay back and heal. \nInstead, it would strictly be a stat check that is engaging for neither party.\n\n\n\n\nAll in all, if shields REALLY are a problem atm, either just nerf them or make em last less long.\n\n","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Seer of Mind","date":"2018-05-01T00:34:38.759+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":2,"body":"Have to agree, if shielding supports get better, it makes the Overheal rune and {{item:3174}} way better for healers as well.

The AS that ardent gives is lower which reflects back into how well its passive can be used, with less AS ADCs can't use the Zeke's passive burn as well, you'll get less healing from knights vow, and that's not to mention that with less AD, AS, and crit any of those stats given to them by a supports kit won't go as far because adcs power is multiplicative across these stats. Supports protecting adcs may become more crucial to the ADCs success, but the value of the ADCs success is going down, so overall the importance of that job goes down. \n\nHopefully this means supports can get to supporting the teams success, instead of just one individuals.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Draehl","date":"2018-05-01T17:46:32.054+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I hope they broadly do a support balance pass.

If you look at his kit the \"burst mage\" archetype doesn't exactly jump out at you aside from ratios and how the kit interacts so well with Electrocute.
