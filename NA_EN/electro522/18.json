I haven't seen anyone attempt this yet, so, figured......why not?\r\n\r\nA friend and I are still working through things to make it all presentable, so, it might be some time before you see any kind of finished product, but, we do need a story to launch things off with.\r\n\r\nWe're currently using Silence for the Damned (link below) as a means to just test things right now, but, if people would like to hear a different story narrated, feel free to suggest it!\r\n\r\nAs for when the first video will be out......who knows. It's possible I may need to invest into a better mic if we want to commit to this (and that isn't saying much, since all I have is the mic that comes with my earbuds...........yeah, really low budget here).\r\n\r\nAnyway, hope I've caught your attention at least.
