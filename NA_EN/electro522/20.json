I do have a few problems, not necessary the video itself but just the production or path Riot takes.  \nEver notice when a tournament is about to happen or just a regular split, Riot releases a \"sneak peak\" video but the video is actually the full video 100% and it's not even a sneak peak because they show the full video or hype trailer anyways so there's that. \n  They use the same hype trailer each week  that they already thrown out a few days before the week started but the problem is they don't have a different hype trailer or video right before that specific game is about to start.   \n  It's like watching the same trailer to a movie multiple times\n This weekend doesn't just have C9 vs FQ, I understand it's the most hyped but we still have Reignover(TL) vs Dardoch(IMT) and Froggen(EF) vs Bjergsen(TSM).  \n  Before the weekend starts show each big game with player voice overs, show it's own video before each of the big games starts that's completely different from the previous hype trailer.  \n\nI don't know I might be the only one and if so I'm glad because at least I can see through some of this stuff. \n - Have a good one everyone!","replies":[]}]}
