However, this little bird easily gets drowned out by a crow who represents the people unhappy with the game.......and how they are just so much louder than those who support Riot.\r\n\r\nDespite it&#039;s intent to be funny, I don&#039;t think someone has posted something more true than that.\r\n\r\nYesterday, The Game Theorists released a video on lootboxes, and at one point, Matpat talked about &quot;Loss Aversion&quot;. It&#039;s exactly what it sounds like......us humans hate losing, and we will go to some pretty extreme lengths to keep it from happening. If you were to watch it, I&#039;m certain you can see the similarities in how League works.\r\n\r\nLeague, at its core is a team game. Your team HAS to work together in order to win, so, if you lose, most of the time, you will feel powerless, as if either your teammates or the game itself is against you.\r\n\r\nOf course, if you don&#039;t like how the game is going, or if you feel that game is in a badly, unbalanced state right now, that is your opinion, and you are entitled to it. Unfortunately, when several like minded people get funneled into one place, it becomes very hard for any differing opinions to rise to the surface.\r\n\r\nAnd this is where we come back to Laughing Fish. Thanks to his popularity, that meme was able to rise up along with many others he had posted, and allow his opinion to get out. If I were to make a similar post, I&#039;d be surprised if it ever saw the light of day.\r\n\r\nThose of us that support Riot do so quietly, even though we really don&#039;t want to. The reason why, is because the majority of the people on the boards will keep us from making our voices heard. And recently, I&#039;ve noticed that people are even starting to take a stand against those that support Riot, basically implying that we are nothing but naive children who worship Riot, and the very ground they walk on.\r\n\r\nWhy even try to make a thread thanking Riot for the work they&#039;ve done, and the amount of attention they give to their community, when you have people like *that* floating around? All that will happen is the thread will be downvoted into oblivion, and no one will ever see it again once it fades off of the &quot;new&quot; page. Hell, I&#039;ll be surprised if this thread doesn&#039;t have at least a score of -3 by the next time I check it.\r\n\r\nAnd to make matters worse.......I see no way of fixing this. These are the official forums of the game. People will come here in hopes of getting their opinions heard, and 8 times out of 10, it will be because they want to complain about something. And what will they find when they come here? Many, *MANY* like minded people who are upset with the game in some way, shape, or form.\r\n\r\nI&#039;ve been a part of the Boards ever since they were made. I&#039;ve seen it grow and shrink o er the years, and I&#039;ve seen it&#039;s highs and lows. But this is the first time in 4 years that I am actively wanting to find a different community, because trying to be a little voice of reason in a massive echo chamber is getting tiring, especially with how the boards have been acting lately. \r\n\r\nI don&#039;t think I have ever seen the boards be *THIS* negative. And you may say that its because of the state of the game, but I&#039;d have to disagree with you. If you&#039;ve been around as long as I have, you may have noticed that the Boards is shrinking. Less and less threads are reaching voting milestones, and the number of comments on any average thread have slowly been going down. We only get slight bumps in population when Riot posts something important.....such as Meddler&#039;s gameplay thoughts. Other than that, the Boards have been on a steady decline ever since their inception. It also seems as if those who support Riot, or are somewhere in the middle are the ones being driven out, making the echo chamber that much louder.\r\n\r\nDespite what you may believe, League of Legends is not dying. If anything, it only continues to grow.\r\n\r\nBut the Boards are.........and its a shame to see something with potential do so.\r\n\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nTL;DR\r\n\r\nThe Boards have become exceedingly negative, and trying to be someone who supports Riot in this echo chamber is just getting way to difficult.","replies":[{"poster":"JeonGoyangi","date":"2018-12-01T00:50:43.655+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im going ahead and locking this thread as it is necro'd \n\n~KittySuppSquad {{sticker:sona-playing}} {{sticker:sg-soraka}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Thresh Outta Fux","date":"2018-01-11T14:34:43.131+0000","up_votes":96,"down_votes":20,"body":"The only reason all of us are still here, is because after you spend years supporting the direction a company is going, only to have them whip around and change from \"Game Balance\" to \"Game Design\", is a major heartbreaker.\n\nWe're just here hoping this abusive relationship will go back to the way things were.\n\nWe don't have an out.

They are counting the cost of the hard ware and soft ware they already own and use in everyone of their skins the only thing that seem i would actualy consider a cost of the skin is their hard ware and soft ware but divided across every skin they have made and continue to make. the special skins that get out side art studios to help and voice acting (and all of those to the company shouldnt even dent the company if they made 300 skins a year) because i doubt they pay any voice actor 400k for voicing a character none the less 30k except celebrity voice actors which i understand there are a few of.\n\nif you understand sales you understand always try to charge for your tools and experties every time.\nWhen i first went to buy skins i thought i would get a good amount of skins for $50 after all its only data on a game that you expect over thousands of sales per region. i went back to my hotel and found i could only buy a couple skins and went back to buy more cards when i realized and i thought man these are overpriced. and i continued to buy for the next 5 years though often opting to wait for 50% off by weekly sales. \n\nDo you think companies ever lose money when they put things on sale no they never do. they only lose out compared to the orignal profit but sales give them profit they wouldnt have gotten because people who buy on sales normally wouldnt have bought at all. things that go on sale arent even worth the money that is the sale price none the less their normal price. My biggest gripe is that if they made skins cheap in the first place they could make more money by selling much more skins rather than selling sets of skins for more money after all its all data the cost is the same to them whether you buy or dont buy but if you have a market size of 800k per legendary skin rather than 200k you could afford to cost cuts wouldnt effect you in the slightest and may even net more money","replies":[{"poster":"Salson","date":"2018-01-11T21:50:07.724+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":4,"body":"Skins have to pay for basically everything:\n-Servers\n-Building\n-Skins team\n-Design team\n-Balance team (if they actually get paid)\n-Tencent's 50% of income\n\nThough I also buy 90% of skins on sale, but more because I consider those 'fair' prices.","replies":[{"poster":"I Like Things ","date":"2018-01-11T23:45:42.247+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Salson,realm=EUNE,application-id=6heBIhQc,discussion-id=UA79L6EJ,comment-id=0002000200000000,timestamp=2018-01-11T21:50:07.724+0000)\n>\n> Skins have to pay for basically everything:\n\n> -Tencent&#x27;s **100%** of income\n> \n> Though I also buy 90% of skins on sale, but more because I consider those &#x27;fair&#x27; prices.\n\nFTFY. \n\nThere is no Riot Games any more.

Stats are fact, Rune pick diversity ratio is a fact, pool of champions with decent pickrate and decent winrate and their amounts is a fact. All the things that could be brought up as why the game is unbalanced is a fact, not an opinion.\n\nI am not saying the game is unbalanced, but If it is and someone states it while backing up their reasoning, they are not stating an opinion, but fact.\n\nAnd If you still thik how cute the OP is by \"tolerating\" the opinion, imagine an Ignorant Orthodox Extreme Religious person saying \"If you think the Earth is round, that is your opinion and you are entitled to it.\". There is nothing more echo chamber than pretending a fact is an opinion, as it allows you to keep your failure, pretend it's truth and disallow any rational discussion change your mind. THAT is an echo chamber.\n\nIf someone says Yasuo is extremly broken and easy to win with while he'd have 0.1% pickrate with 30% winrate, they are not stating opinion, they are stating false claim. Likewise, If someone claims Yasuo is in balanced state while he'd have 60% pickrate, 40% banrate and 80% winrate, they would be bulshitting, too. If you say Yasuo is fun to play as, that is an opinion. Someone might find his design boring and overrated, some might say it's unique. And even here If we led the debate long enough, we would reach objective specifics.\n\nWhether someone who wants to live in echo chamber wants it or not, Riot team can make major mistakes (laughs in ardent) and pretending they weren't mistakes but some people simply had the opinion they didn't like it is going to make them learn nothing and not improve.\n\nSurely, maybe majority of such complaints are stubborn, inaccurate, sloppy and expressed in a dick manner, but they tend to at least dance around valid point and it is up to Rioters to find that point to learn from it. And no matter how dickish the Boards get, Rioters repeatedly stated they do want to hear the feedback, sometimes posting in threads that were rude.\n\nSo TL;DR: Most people I've heard complaining about echo chamber just want echo chamber of different kind, so I don't believe discussion about such topic can even be led into something contributing.

Posts like the first one use to be quiet common. Now they aren't, because riot never responds to any of it, so people get tired and frustrated with being ignored and go with the short and sweet way.\n\nWhy waste your time making a detailed and long drawn out post to point out a problem, if its just going to be ignored anyways? Better to say your issue short and sweet and have ignored then put effort into it and have it ignored. it pisses people off a lot less when they don't put that much effort in it.\n\nRiot has proven they don't care what the community thinks, they believe they know better then people that collectively play the game more then all of them combined. Its prideful ignorance on riots end, nothing more or less. Actually no, that's a bit unfair, they aren't ignorant, that would imply that all this crap hasn't been on purpose. It has, it has been done for the sake of LCS and E$PORTs, which would be fine, if it didn't sacrifice the experience for the average player.","replies":[{"poster":"Electro522","date":"2018-01-11T18:45:19.638+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":4,"body":"Alright, but despite that, Riot has said time, and time, and time again that they read as much as they can on these boards.

You have to take them at their word. Take EA for example, they same the same thing, but we all know they are full of it. Its all fine and good to give a company a benefit of a doubt. But Riot has a track recorded of them saying one thing and doing another.\n\nI very much would like to believe riot, but time and experience with these big game companies has taught me that what they say can never be taken at face value. They can very well read it, but they don't have to actually listen, you get what I mean? Words on deaf ears if you get what I am saying.\n\nThe boards can give all the valuable critique possible in the greatest of detail and almost non of it will really be listened to, out side of easy to fix bugs or ones that fundamentally break the game in an exploitive way.

They do interact with us, a lot more than other game companies do or would.

I used to play this game as if there were no tomorrow back in Season 1-4, but it's tough to do it now.  \n\nThe community is terrible, toxicity is still way out of hand but I could certainly forgive or ignore that if it weren't for the simple fact that this game's balance is just in the shitter.  The number one complaint that I have with the game and have seen by so many both here on the Boards and among the few friends that I have that still play is that damage is just too high and games snowball too quickly.  Strategy and Skill are tempered by who can press a button the fastest and who picked the champion that does the most damage in the shortest amount of time.  \n\nThis isn't the game I fell in love with, at all.  \n\n*\"So why don't you just uninstall?\"*  Maybe I should, but truthfully I've been trying to express my opinions about the state of the game for a long time and obviously Riot isn't listening.  I know I throw out my share of snarky responses to posts here, but I used to write these long, well-thought-out, reasonable posts and never had one Rioter response... all the way back to 2011... \n\nAfter awhile, you just see Riot ignoring the community as a whole and it pisses you off, sometimes they write some blatant bullshit that is even more frustrating... such as the most recent \"Quick Gameplay Thoughts\" where they say that they don't really think games are more snowbally because they surveyed a whole one-hundred people.  Of course, this goes along nicely with their tone-deaf attitudes about a lot of things through the years, most recently URF, but certainly things like Team Builder, the Dynamic Queue fiasco of Season 6, the terrible reworks/class updates, etc etc... There's practically no accountability... \n\nJust once I'd love to see Riot offer up a mea culpa and say \"yeah, we fucked up real bad on that one, sorry folks\".  Instead we get a lot of mysterious data for why they make these decisions (data that never gets shown or is so vague that it offers no real insight).  \n\nThe preseason changes and the Blue Essence nightmare were really the last straw for me.  I haven't played in over a week and I'm not really missing it.  I don't know... maybe I'm just a part of the growing sect of dissatisfied customers.  \n\nGiven all of that, how can one be positive about the state of the game?","replies":[{"poster":"Crimsonkapa","date":"2018-01-12T00:44:01.068+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":4,"body":"Just gonna throw this out there that Riot has MULTIPLE TIMES admitted when they've screwed up, so your whole bit on \"Riot offering a mea culpa\" is dramaticized fake news.
