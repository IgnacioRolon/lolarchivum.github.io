Immortals have been doing ok, and thanks to how both Fnatic and GAM are performing, I think its safe to say they have a firm grasp on second place. As for Fnatic, I think people are catching on to GAM&#039;s silly antics, considering the Sion ban from Immortals today. Because of that, I think Fnatic won&#039;t fall for the same tricks again. I don&#039;t think there will be a tie breaker between the 2 though, since neither will move on to groups.\n\nDay 6: Group C\n\nRNG: 6-1\nSSG: 5-2\nG2: 2-4\nFB: 0-6\n\nDespite RNG manhandling SSG yesterday, I wouldn&#039;t count SSG out just yet. I do think if they pull it together that can take a game off of RNG, and force a tie breaker, which RNG will come back with a vengeance, and take first seed. G2, even though I have them set at 2-4, does have the potential to shake things up. I can see them taking a game off of SSG and denying the tie breaker. As for them getting out groups, sorry EU, but I don&#039;t think it&#039;ll happen. As for FB, they&#039;re play in performance was awesome, but they just don&#039;t stand a chance here.\n\nDay 7: Group D\n\nMisfits: 5-1\nWE: 4-2\nTSM: 3-3\nFW: 0-6\n\nEDIT: Dr. Poro pointed out that my predicition on group D simply cannot happen, because it would require both Misfits and WE to go 3-0.....which is impossible since they face each other once. This means that if both of them win their other games, whoever wins that match takes first place, and there will be no tie breaker.\n\nNow here&#039;s something I didn&#039;t expect I&#039;d be doing, but I think Misfits found something. Sure, they got utterly destroyed by WE, but then they utterly destroy FW, then go on to play TSM like a fiddle. I&#039;m thinking they could definitely force WE into a tie breaker, and actually take it for first seed. Yes, that is a ton a faith to put into them, but I honestly think they found something, and are taking full advantage of it.\n\nAnd yes, I do have TSM not making it out of groups. Sorry, but I think we&#039;re just seeing a repeat of every other worlds they&#039;ve been to. They are going to crash and burn, and disappoint everyone *again*. Just watch.\n\nDay 8: Group A\n\nSKT: 6-1\nC9: 5-2\nAHQ: 2-4\nEDG: 0-6\n\nNow, if you thought my TSM prediction was bold, what do you think of me thinking C9 will take a game off of SKT? Despite SKT being 3-0, and coming back from an _**ELEVEN THOUSAND**_ gold deficit after just 1 teamfight, we have seen that they are vulnerable. Both AHQ and EDG exposed weaknesses that I think C9 could take advantage of. In fact, had C9 not pulled the short straw in playing SKT first, I think it may have been very possible that C9 would be sitting at 3-0 instead of SKT.\n\nBut, this is SKT we&#039;re talking about. C9 will force a tie breaker, but SKT will take the first seed. They have a habit of leaving a trail of devastation behind when they get pissed off, and, considering Faker&#039;s interviews, I don&#039;t think anything will piss them off more than losing to Impact, their former top laner.\n\nAs for EDG, well.......I think they&#039;re done. The SKT game was simply too much of a blow, and I find it difficult they could come back after going 0-3. But, if there is any team at worlds that can prove me wrong, it is EDG.","replies":[{"poster":"DarkRooster","date":"2017-10-08T16:29:57.838+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"C9 will choke as much as TSM, do you think this is the first year or endless year when someone over hypes TSM or C9 and ends up disappointed ?

That is MATHEMATICALLY IMPOSSIBLE within the group.\n\nYeah,  MSF and We can't both go 3-0 because they play once and one of them will have a loss.  I'm not convinced that Edward is so bad they're not going to take a game off of somoene.  And I'm not convinced that all three teams in D are so much better than FW that FW won't win one game.  It happened once, it can happen again obviously.  But I wouldn't predict both going 0-3. Maybe one or the other.  But not both.    If anyone may go 0-3 it's Fnatic.  Airing dirty laundry in public is a bad sign for them.   FB may go 0-3 tooo.  They're a bit overmatched.   From most likely to least likely to go 0-3 I'd take FB, FNC, FW, ED.   \n\nThat three and three thing with TSM you posted is a bit worrisome.   The other worrisome thing is this.  The three way tie at 4-2 where the three teams beat each other again and nobody gets untied by the head to head. , if nobody gets untied by the head to head just among the three, in years past they've had games and the seed is determined by the time.    Right now We would be 1,   That means TSM would play one more game against MSF and the loser would go home.  The winner would play We.   That would really suck to go 4-2, lose that, and go home.     So hopefully We and MSF take a loooooooooong time for their wins if that comes to pass.    But each of the three We, MSF, and TSM all have their own destiny in hand.  Beat the other two and they're in.  Beat FW in addition to the other two and it's first in group guaranteed.    Can't ask for more than that.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Stillname","date":"2017-10-11T02:17:57.716+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Misfits and WE can't both go 3-0.","replies":[]},{"poster":"xJLx MCHammer","date":"2017-10-08T21:27:14.093+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bold predictions\n\nI believe TSM and WE will get out. Mostly because Misfits just don't have an answer for any lane. They all lose in terms of laning but are held together because Sven is not good anymore\n\nI think SKT and C9 will get out. C9 only has to win one game vs AHQ and I think they can.\n\nLZG and IMT will get out. FNC trying too hard to put everything into rekkless, even in an ADC meta.

The 2-0 over AHQ is very important.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Electro522","date":"2017-10-08T22:13:24.475+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I also think Doublelift is cracking.

This is perhaps the biggest meta in terms of how impactful ADC's are. IF he can't step it up now with Trist and Xayah, he should retire.\n\nI do agree, Hauntz is the reason they are 2-1. Without some of his play, I'd consider them as #3 in this group","replies":[]}]}]}]}
