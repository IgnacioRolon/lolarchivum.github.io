And it&#x27;s pretty adorable and perfect she has glasses :&#x27;)\n\nFirst of all i want to say Star Guardians are probably Riot's best skin franchise, to me at least. They've done an amazing job and these threads are only created to help them in furthering their excellence with this franchise!\n\nSo, My main plea is that if Riot can provide us more tanks, top lane and jungle potential as Star Guardians, I think a lot of people would be really happy.\n\nBefore i give my list, i just want to say that I don't think we really need any more male star guardians. Ezreal being the only male in the group is fine, because it actually fits his character (kind of like a harem in an anime lol). The only two exceptions i'd even think about is  (Taric), and  (Rakan) ONLY if (Xayah) gets one. Historically, they have to have the same skins - but i don't see that happening honestly.\n\nNow, here is a list of potential candidates.\n\n (Irelia) - as the leader, color red? (There's a link to the design concept attached created by xxsmell from twitter, found this amazing idea concept by Elinz's thread \"Star Guardian Irelia (Skin Concept!)\")\n (Riven) - color green?\n (Diana) - color white?\n (VI) - color pink?\n (Leona) - color yellow?\nAll of these are very good selections to fit as Star Guardians due to their personalities, strong will, and the roles that Star Guardians actually need currently for 2018. (We have one current tank / top laner and that's  (Poppy), so it's hard to make full star guardian teams).\n\nFan favorites and Runner up's are:\n\n (Sona) - Everyone wants Sona, hell even i do! But is she really needed? We have 3 supports already. The only reason  (Leona) gets in the list is because she's a tank support, something kind of new.\n (Zoe) - We already have 3 potential mid lane Star Guardians, but I mean come on lol, Zoe has star guardian all over her face and personality.\n (Nidalee) - Though she is a squishy jungler, she's still a jungler and her personality may fit in well as a Star Guardian.\n (Taliyah) - Brings nothing new to the roles as a mid laner, just like  , but I think she would fit well into the skin franchise.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PeachyBubbleStar","date":"2018-01-05T08:19:58.325+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"haHAAAA (please for the love of GOD make this skin a thing, it's THE MOST requested thing iv'e ever seen so much of xD) (besides as a Taliyah main, this is the one thing i ask for in life ;w; XD, it would complete my soul) ;__; the only Taliyah skin that will matter to me XD","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"PeachyBubbleStar","date":"2018-01-05T08:30:57.667+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"This skin literally just NEEDS to happen i will actually cry the day rito makes a cute peachy pinky orangy yellow colored star guardian taliyah skin (freakin swoon and faint if it's an 1820 skin ;O;) (cries) rito ;w; PLISSSS (have some ideas kek) Q is shooting stars (duh xD) Passive is riding a shooting star (or maybe a familiar, the familiar could be so many different things that she could even ride lol) W could have a star spike out of the ground and knock someone, or maybe a familiar pops out? or maybe a space cloud puff of sparkles lol, her E can obviously be stars that shoot upward when knocked into... and her ulti (well MY favorite idea i thought of was) if she makes a wall of sparkly cloud starry puffs  lol... or any ideas you can come up with rito xD  (also heres some lil other details) her flying out of base would be so pretty when she twirls with her sleeves ;w; ahh... her dance can be based on Kpop or anime dance references xD like some other skins, her recall can be literally so many cute things ugh...
