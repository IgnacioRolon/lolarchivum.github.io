When it does this, it takes up the majority of my internet, and it makes it almost impossible to do anything on the internet. If it happens in the middle of a League game, I can go from a very respectable ping of 60, all the way up to over 1000 (yes, its that bad).\r\n\r\nAnd, the amount of time it takes to download whatever it downloads seems to take a random amount of time. It could take only a few seconds, to a few minutes, to hours.\r\n\r\nI've tried stopping it before through my Task Manager, but, when I try to do this, I get a message saying that my computer will not run normally if I do so. I obviously don't want that, so, I've tried to just work with it. Thing is, it does this nearly every time I get on my computer. There is no warning, no pop up saying \"Hey, do you want this to happen?\"......nothing. It just does it completely on its own, and I can't stop it or prevent it.\r\n\r\nI'd just like to know what the hell this program is, and if there is anyway to stop it downloading while in the middle of a League game. I'm fine letting it work in between games, but if it starts while in game, I'd very much like to stop it.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-07-25T17:32:51.458+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't know the specifics of your PC and OS, so I can't be sure if you might have malware on your account disguised as a process.
