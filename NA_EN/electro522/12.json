Also, personally, I think he's gone from a far more 'subtle' champion to one that's just clearly powerful. A limping old man with a cane is someone people are far more likely to underestimate, than a dude with a glowing demon arm. That was part of his old charm, that he relied entirely on his mind outside of the few instances where he'd used his full caw caw bird powers. \nAnd speaking of, why move away from the carrion bird morph? Sure, he still get wings and they look nice and all, but wouldn't the bird form have worked as well, if he's still got the birds as part of his theme? I'm not saying I dislike a fancy pair of wings like he has, I'm just saying that it's far more generic than what he had before. \nI'm still going to give him a chance, because I love Noxus' lore and their position in the universe, but it still sorta seem like you took one of the more subtle champions in the game and turned him into a far more obvious powerhouse.

I joined Riot last year, and moved to League as Lead Editor specifically around September. I&#x27;m afraid there&#x27;s nothing I can do about the years where story/lore wasn&#x27;t served as well as you guys would have liked - I didn&#x27;t work here, I didn&#x27;t make those decisions. I&#x27;ve asked around about whether we have a time machine somewhere in the studio, but no one replied to my email.\n\nFair enough, I got your title wrong, my apologies.\n\nI understand you were only employed last year, and I don't blame you specifically for the lack of lore-work that happened over the years, I understand that it's beyond your control. My main issue is with making a statement about player interest and activity with statistics as you did. Those statistics don't just start on the date of your employment.\n\nHow long and how broad are the stats you're referring to? Is it only within the last 1-3 years? I am assuming you have background material for Swain when preparing and editing for the new lore, surely you know how long Swain has actually been in the game and that if the timespan of the statistics doesn't match, then you wouldn't be able to see the full context.\n\nSurely checking the background for the statistics you are going to use to back up a statement, would have brought something up? You don't need a 'time machine', just some logical deduction.\n\n> \n> Instead, I&#x27;m going to choose to focus on the fact that you like the Narrative work on Swain (for the most part).

Like I said, I'm fine with the rework overall, and most of my nitpick so far has been purely cosmetic. Depending on the bios when they release, I may have more misgivings but let's be optimistic till then.\n\n> But Riot culture is written right there on the website.

Yet at the same time, Riot has mentioned that they hope to diversify their roster with non-typical character designs. I am sure many had hoped that Swain remained in that camp, as he once did, being the 'creepy old raven guy'.\n\nBecause it is not hard to see current Swain as being the result of focus-testing the '[anime MMO wings](https://www.google.com.sg/search?q=anime+mmo+wings&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi4lPDtqfLYAhXDq48KHQ8eC0YQ_AUICigB&biw=1920&bih=968)' popular in the Asian/China market combined with fangirlism for Lucius Malfoy/Sephiroth.\n\n> Personally, I don&#x27;t mind Swain&#x27;s new hair - but I wouldn&#x27;t advise him AGAINST going to see a barber at some point... :-P\n\nI just don't buy that being an aristocrat automatically means he needs long douchebag haircut. Heck, IRL aristocrats also wore powdered wigs and styled their hair, so that's not really a good reason at all. Swain could tie that mullet into a ponytail and bam, long and short hair all at once.\n\nRight now he looks so much like a combination Lucius Malfoy + [Vlad von Carstein pre-full-vamp-face-on](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/7f/aa/97/7faa97f4ce65821e7bb08b3bcfed55cf.jpg), that I have seriously been subconsciously referring to him as THAT 'Vlad' since the reveal.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Nefas","date":"2018-01-23T23:50:16.901+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"I hate that argument so much. It’s an argument not for making champs the best versions of themselves but for making them into *other champs*. It’s a philosophy that stands on a knife’s edge. Sometimes the tidbits that are kept are just enough to tie the new rework to the old champ, sometimes they are not. But the fans of the old champ ought to have more of a say than people who don’t play the champ at all. The problems with this rework that a lot of people are articulating is that this doesn’t look or feel like Swain - it feels like a completely new separate champ. Swain’s old core being, distilled down, was his phrase “let’s morph and eat em” - tied into his full transformation ult. That is surely something you’d agree could be built into a broader, more interesting champ?

As for such, its leader (and master tactician) should be in the capital coordinating and moving his armies, not on one particular front \"ripping souls out from this enemies\" (wow, so coooool!).\n\nAnd this has nothing to do with the consideration i have of myself, put it is purely observation:\n\nXerath is now a cookie cutter villain;\nDiana has killed \"by mistake\" the elders, and not intentionally in revenge;\nPoppy isn't ugly-faced yordle anymore;\nYorick isn't an outcast creepy hunchback that failed to find a partner;\nUrgot lost his \"fat and repulsive\" archetype;\n\nThe idea those facts gave me is that Riot's narrative is pushing for pleasing the most people possible.\n\nAnd to be honest reading their various statements regarding the matter, mine isn't even an \"opinion\". Look up at the very rioter comment i quoted in this thread:\n\n> Swain was a champion who didn't provoke a lot of strong feelings either way, as PE just articulated very clearly. Based on a LOT of player data and feedback, old Swain not particularly interesting to a lot of players. Now there are a lot MORE players who want to find out more.\n\nThe changes Swain reiceved were made to make him more generically appealing to the great public. This involves a great narrative risk: if you build your characters not by the story you want to tell, not by your own creativity, not because they fit their personality or the world they live in, but by a **merely marketing practice to appeal the minimum common denominator, the quality of your work goes down.** And League is going strongly in that direction.
