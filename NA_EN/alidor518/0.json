You can have a riven, nunu, skarner, darius, shyvana, almost any tank roll, and find out all they do is flip the game against you irl. Would you like to discuss this with your paying customers?  Care to explain this glitch? Otherwise I have a indestructible nunu that goes ap that has game breaking armor scale WHILE hitting me for 600 damage....Seems like that&#039;s kind of a glitch. Wouldn&#039;t the nunu with armor/ap have been more appropriate with all armor then a ap scale that was coefficient with nunus mechanics. Other games there is a balance too it. So frustrating that you are letting bots do all this glitching.\r\n\r\nHappens to my adc sometimes as well. I do normal flow damage. Then one game I hit for like 60 damage. Think some people got stuck with the roaming eyeball...","replies":[{"poster":"Nyanza","date":"2016-11-05T18:05:27.105+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This should be moved to memes and games","replies":[]},{"poster":"Alidor518","date":"2016-11-05T16:46:36.635+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its a scale balance issue. The damage scales on the game don't balance in higher elo play. My instances seem normal. A skarner can run in on a full party and not die. A poppy can run in on a full party and not die. It'd be fine if it was just the armor, but to make it even less fun for all the non bots that actually do play league, they now do indestrucable damage to all the players. Why is this brought up, cause as a adc, I literally now do zero damage to a skarner. So that's a big ol zero on a adc against a tank. 20% would have been nice at least.","replies":[]},{"poster":"I am Pacman","date":"2016-11-05T16:38:21.019+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What the hell are you complaining about.
