You can have different medals for the various tiers to make them distinct from the ones that exist now for SR and TT, and it will hedge against League being too linear in its focus in the years / decade to come.   A ranked queue is not a guarantee of toxicity in itself, that's on the players.  SR, for me as well as many others, is stale, not appealing to play and even less appealing to watch, but I know that remains a marginal fact in the grand scheme of the current LoL landscape.  With DotA 2 continuing to narrow the gap, Fortnite enjoying incredible success and even having Drake play live with its foremost streamer, there's tangible value in having a conversation that implements a larger ranked lineup not only to give the existing player base a change of pace, but a way to market League to new players who aren't interested in as much of a dedicated laning and last hitting phase.\n\nAs someone who used to be fairly toxic but now plays chill as much as possible, I knew then and now it was my choice to behave in a shitty way, just like it is the conscious choice of toxic players to continuously make shitty behavioral choices.  Playing ranked is also optional and gives another avenue for competitive play for players like me who only have fun when tryharding.  I was part of the UC Berkeley Theory of E-Sports class in its first go 'round in 2011 that Studio co-taught (former high ELO player turned shoutcaster for IPL).  That experience, coupled with my on and off again time with LoL over the years, convinces me it will be a misstep overall not to make an audacious choice here.  Playing it safe while other developers take risks is one of many ways a market can narrow or get lost.\n\nLast of my thoughts on the matter.  :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chavez Obama","date":"2018-09-04T02:02:31.564+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for being direct.\n\nWhile I think it's a shame keeping this mode as one focused on strictly goofing around (as opposed to having the capability for both casual and competitive play), and it feels like it will end up many of the same issues that Dominion had, it is a lot of fun at the moment. \n\nHere's looking forward to more NB development.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MickAnzolius","date":"2018-08-31T21:38:07.545+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The ranked one is in the [faq](https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/features/nexus-blitz-patch-notes)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Star PlatinumELO","date":"2018-08-31T15:29:30.022+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was wondering if it was planned or not, but Bloodletters Veil isn't an item you can buy in Nexus Blitz anymore.","replies":[{"poster":"AD Yuumi","date":"2018-08-31T21:37:44.977+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"we removed it, was giving mages too much power while not being all that exciting (compared to items like DFG)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Mogarl","date":"2018-08-29T20:33:05.673+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:202}}'s Move speed from his passive needs a cap in this mode, and/or Zephyr needs it's move speed to be unique.

This feels like a step in the right direction towards capturing a market that wants ‘fast and fun’ gaming.\n\nIt goes without saying that after almost a decade, Summoner’s Rift has become stale to many players. It is a slower game mode, which places it out of serious consideration for many players such as myself.  I can’t be devoting an undetermined chunk of time of between 20 – 60+ minutes to a single game. It feels like slogging through 15+ minutes of sitting in a lane clicking creeps and interacting with maybe one or two other champions before the ‘fun part’, aka the actual fighting. And the fighting itself will be most interesting only if both teams end up being evenly farmed up. Also, if I were to queue up for such a game and it’s clear that our team is going to lose, it feels like I’m stuck in a game where no one wants to be there.\n\nWe could go on and on about how I feel, but the most important question that it really comes down to: \n\n**_What does Riot actually want to do with experimental modes?_** Do they want something that competes with modern games such as Fortnite? That makes sense, but it also goes against their philosophy of Summoner’s Rift being the only game mode that actually matters. This has been the MO since at least early-mid 2012. \n\nBut perhaps, with the success of games such as Fortnite, times are changing. Does Riot want a game mode where players can blow off steam in the Riot ecosystem before returning to the only mode that matters (SR)? If so, I’m not sure why we need this, when ‘we’ already have ARAM and the rotational modes for casual play. And Twisted Treeline for… something, although that’s the new Dominion, but it has Ranked that keeps it barely alive for season rewards. And definitely not Dominion, which finally passed on after its red-headed stepchild existence. Personally, I would love a competitive and fast game mode. As it currently is, it feels like yet another rotational game mode, and from the sound of it (https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/features/nexus-blitz-patch-notes), Riot wants to make it more of a Super Smash Bros. Brawl, and less of a Super Smash Bros Melee.\n\nHowever you proceed, please don’t let this be another half-baked effort to compete with another product, as it seems Dominion may have been a hedge against the incoming juggernaut of DotA 2 back in the day. Once it became clear that DotA 2 was not going to knock league off the throne, so to speak, and with the Summoner’s Rift esports scene taking off, Dominion support pretty much went from 100 to 0 just like that. That 100 was quite impressive for Dominion if one looks at the press and media releases at the time. But so far, it appears that the effort behind Nexus Blitz has been minimal compared to Dominion release.  The lack of promotion implies heavily that now and later, the support for the mode will be minimal in the best of times and Zero Dark Rito, as with Dominion at various points, in the worst of them. \n\nIf you are trying to do something big, do you have employees who understand more fast-paced modes, such as Dominion? Maybe one-man man crew, ManWolfAxeBoss? There’s surely many ex-Dominion players who would be able to provide urgently needed guidance, should there be a serious effort to succeed here. Is there such a drive? \n\nOr is this an effort to simply fill in a checkbox that you tried something new? If so, again, why create another mode that you won’t support? That was one of the drivers for having rotating game modes. No poorly supported map is going to survive in a healthy way, so if Riot wants to accurately judge the viability of a new mode, they need to put more effort into promoting and developing them. Otherwise, these modes will all die out. Adding ranked is an instantaneous way to give it credibility. But another purely casual mode? Unless something internally at Riot has changed, it will die out just like Dominion did, with a vicious cycle of the players not caring, so then riot doesn’t care, so then the players don’t care even more, and so on. If you are going to make a permanent mode, please don’t do half-measures. It wasn’t a great player experience. And as Dozing Gray Fox mentioned on the last thread, and this echoes the sentiments of many of the ex--Dominion players who would be part of your target demographic for this map, _without a ranked queue, this map will never be taken seriously_.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, for the changes that I would make regardless of your goals:\n\n**The RNG is currently too strong: **It feel unfulfilling on both sides, when you get an objective that is clearly biased to one team, and doubly so when the winning team gets a strong buff such as the GA buff. You mentioned this in the Nexus Blitz patch notes. Even if you do want to keep it as a casual mode, this extreme RNG does not feel great for either team.\n\n**The balance is not great:** As people become more accustomed to the map, the meta will evolve to where people know what is OP. Since the game is balanced for SR, there will be certain champs which are OP to the level that would be considered hotfixable level on SR (see: Sauron’s old dominion tier list: http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?p=24615769). This may not be a problem if there is a team on top of balancing for the mode, but again, based on history (TT, Dominion), this doesn’t seem likely on any reasonable timescale. Without bans, blind pick will end up being filled with mostly broken champs, which does not make for an enjoyable player experience. And without ranked, no one will take this problem seriously. And neither a ranked queue or a draft queue is likely to be populated with enough players without support from the parent company.\n\n\n**Another potential idea: Combine the Map/ re-use elements from the Crystal Scar: **\nThis one has been tossed back and forth between some ex-Dominion players. The Crystal Scar was fast and fun, but what it always lacked was some central objective to compete for. The storm shield was okay, but it didn’t have that impactfulness. If you guys were to combine some of the creeps in Nexus Blitz, along with the events, with the point capturing of dominion, that could be a winning combination, fun for casual or competitive play.","replies":[{"poster":"Kazekiba","date":"2018-08-29T01:47:46.127+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I keep forgetting about DND, aka \"Quinn Winns\" and Im glad you brought it back up.

It feels a lot better and doesn't seem to drag on as long\n\nSword of the Divine is still kind of funny and cheesy.  Honestly I was just reminded why it was removed when I tried using it though.  The statline is a lot better than the old one and not losing the stats for the active being on CD is nice.\n\nBlessing of Caitlynn is interesting, nice damage but the infrequency of firing makes it unreliable.  I understand why it doesn't fire often but so many times I see cannons run into lanes and die before even acquiring a target.\n\nHaven't gotten loot Veigar yet.\n\nI've only gotten Paranoia Royale once but it was very interesting, fun, and scary.  Nothing like seeing a melee fight pop out of nowhere when you're on a long ranged champion.\n\nI have played about 70 games and I am absolutely loving it.  Fast paced action with early teamfighting and skirmishing much like dominion had and aram has, but it has a strategic level and map plays which the howling abyss severely lacks.\n\nNasus stacking seems to be a bit too high.  With it being blind pick you can't build a team against him and if you just don't have the tools to shut him down in a teamfight he can just autowin a game.\n\nJhin is performing a little too well, his abilities cover a huge portion of this small map and his current speed build is only amplified by some of the cool items that this mode has.  The on-fire buff makes him hit like a freight train.\n\nThis iteration of zephyr is really nice, less attack speed but actually having sizable attack damage makes me consider the item in a lot more scenarios than the old one.\n\nI feel like I have a lot of build options with the legacy items.  That was the big hook for me when this mode was announced and it has helped keep me here.  I'm all for trying out \"new\" items in the mode.  Innervating locket, soul shroud, the old spellvamp items.  I honestly thing Ionic Spark could stand a chance.  HP and attack speed are hard to come by.\n\nAnother good option is bringing back old iterations of current items.  Runaans Hurricane was great for on-hit chapmions but not everybody needs the crit chance.  Essence Reaver has had a couple of reworks, let's just chuck them all in the shop and see what happens.  Discount BT essence reaver was great on Draven but the newer ones just don't work as well.\n\nLastly there's always the cut Black Market Brawlers items that you could throw in here.  Dead man's plate made it to SR but some of the cool ones like Typhoon claws and Trickster's Glass were goofy and fun but a little too meme-y for summoner's rift.

Can you please reconsider how Aatrox loses the on-fire buff when dying through his ultimate? Tryndamere, for example, doesn't technically die but is able to use his ult properly and not lose the buff. Zilean should also receive the same benefit. It makes sense that it doesn't persist through GA, but I think it would make sense for it to work with a champion's kit and not against it.\n\n2. I'm still noticing power imbalances with the event rewards. BF shields are still monstrously powerful and are enough to swing a game because they NEVER EXPIRE. There's no counter play available to a team except to fight.\n\n3. I'll echo a previous comment about decreasing the champion selection timer and increasing the loadout selection timer.\n\n4. Finally, range-heavy teams are still much stronger than melee teams. The buff is too easy to get and HOLD ONTO with certain ranged champs (Ziggs, Lux, to name a couple examples). Increasing damage from turrets is almost irrelevant because they won't be tower diving on their own. It's certain champions' ability to survive with the buff that makes it too difficult to deal with.\n\nEdit:\n\n5. The ELO rankings for this mode are just whacked. It seems no matter how well I play, I still consistently get teams that don't match my skill level or get placed in games too easy for me. Other times it's the opposite.

It's been the most fun I've had in league in a while.\nThanks for making this awesome mode :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Totaljester","date":"2018-09-01T18:16:30.115+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I have a lot of thoughts on Nexus Blitz. I have to say that I've always been a fan of alternative maps in MOBA's, especially in League. Nexus Blitz has a lot of cool stuff going on if it but I think it could be better. And where that gets dicey is that I think making the map more serious makes it more fun.\n\nIn particular, the random events that happen on the maps are honestly more frustrating than they are cool or fun. Often, a team that just wins a teamfight is punished and is too weak to do what is required to win or survive an event and the team that lost and is just now respawning is far better off. In essence, Nexus Blitz can punish you for success. I think the map layout and the role dynamics are interesting enough to not need the spice of the events, personally, but if they're not negotiable, then they need to not punish a successful team with half-health and no ults. \n\nEdit: On further gameplay, the battle for the center/ring of fire event is by far the worst. That's the one that punishes winning teams. It cost my team a game. A player just finished getting back to base after a fight, immediately killed by ring. Everyone else, half health, is forced to fight the now--respawned enemy team. The following teamfight we, of course, get destroyed and the enemy team snowballs the game and we lose super hard from that point on. I understand events are supposed to be silly and introduce something fun, but having the carpet pulled out from under you and watching you lose from something entirely beyond your control is the most unfun thing that can happen in this game on any map.\n\nSecond, I'd like to suggest that Nexus Blitz is too much of a blitz. In all the games I've played, a won teamfight around 9 minutes just ends the game. Its neither fun for the winning or losing team. It's just killing structures with full knowledge that the other team won't respawn or get in position in time. I think exterior towers are falling at the right time but the 2nd towers fall super fast. I think the second line of towers should have higher hp. While I'm sure that isn't in the spirit of Nexus Blitz (which I think is a silly name anyway, the map dynamic and roles are far more interesting than the fact that the game can end in 11 minutes), these second towers fall super quick when a team can get onto them, which is usually around 7 or 8 minutes and the players are level 9-11. I think this is a game mode that can have great comeback potential, though I understand a concern is that games might last too long. TBH, I'd just like to see the game last as long as an ARAM, 3v3, or Ascension, which is like 18-22 min.\n\nAnd now a laundry list of issues:\n\nRed buff at the top of the map is too unforgiving in its leash. The four junglers contesting it will just lead to frustrating re-leashing to where both sides just abandon it. If we're going to put this red buff in a spot on the map where it's going to be fought over, the leash time and distance needs to reflect that.\n\nI think exp for a solo lane is too high. The junglers often are fighting or skirmishing a lot and end up incredibly underlevelled when they join fights. Part of that, though, is likely that many people are prioritizing skirmishing because the camps feel like they take so painfully long. \n\nAdditionally, I'd like to suggest a higher amount of starting gold. I think the 850 like in 3v3 is an excellent spot to be in. In a game where building and finishing items feels good, you don't get to finish more than 1 or 2 items in this mode. Additionally, being able to have a bit more choice in how you want to play the early game, especially jungling, would be great. I might take an extra longsword for damage or cloth armor for the enemy AD junglers and safer jungle clear. Maybe boots to rush to an early gank.\n\nIt's weird that minions are wayyy faster than champions.\n\nI love the MR+Regen+Movespeed item.

It was lighthearted and intense fun and i did not feel the burnout as much as back when URF was launched... going back to Summoners Rift felt weird however but that is only natural since Nexus Blitz has a increased pace as opposed to the other modes which i greatly enjoy considering you can almost avoid the early game entirely (and the boring Minion last hitting part)\n\nBut enough of that. Lets dive into this shall we?\n\nFirst i want to give a bit of a overview of the mode. Then i will jump into the different rewards/events followed by the reintroduced items and lastly what the roster in general feels like during blitz.\n\n\n> \n> The Gamemode\n>\n\n**Overall** i think Nexus Blitz manages to scratch the itch it was intended to. The games are fast paced and packed with intense team fights on a map that is greatly condensed. \n\n**_\"Sudden Death\"_** helps basically \"capping\" the longest possible time you spend in Blitz so no matter what you can always say you have \"enough time for a round of Blitz\" if you only got half an hour. Which is impossible to do on SR since the games can range widely.\n\nThe Maps layout allows a variety of champions to shine (some more than others) as the lanes offer a wide but longer battlefield while the Jungle offers the possibility to sneak behind your opponents to ambush a on fire Squishy due to its winding paths. \n\nThe Map itself is by no means perfect in layout and it surely will go through a lot of transformations once Riot has a design/fantasy for the theme in mind. But i think it does its job nicely despite it making some Ranged champions very hard to deal with. \n*coughs* {{champion:99}} {{champion:101}} {{champion:115}} \n\nDeath Timers seem reasonable but should be still a tad bit shorter late game i believe.\n\n\n> Events and Rewards\n\nLet us start with the events themselves.\n\n{{item:3348}}  _**Bardle Royal / Bardle Royal Juggernaut/ Paranoia Royale:**_ {{item:3348}} \n\n\nEnjoyable. It really helps that you are allowed to instantly re spawn (although it sometimes does feel bad if you managed to kill a lot of the enemy team before the event starts) The event is as stressful as it was intended and allows the game mode to really distinct itself from the others. While some Champions like Poppy do have advantages here (as well as most CC champions) it is a very welcome event i always enjoy having around especially if it is not super early into the game. \n\nA personal nitpick with this event and one that (apparently) is shared in the community is that it sometimes circles deep into the enemy team. My suggestion here would be that it either only spawns on the axis of the map in the middle and only very slightly shifts to the side of the loosing team. (something you seemed to have addressed for the most part with the last update). A filter could be implemented however that requires the turret to be destroyed before being eligible for being the center, just a thought.\n\nAs for Paranoia Royale? It is the least fun event to me from these three. I understand the basic thought behind it but it is really annoying to deal with and seems to heavily favor melee type characters and bruisers (which seemed intentional) I like the fact that it forces you within closer range of your opponent, but that seems to be achieved by the other versions already in part. Maybe reduce vision range less intensely but make the circle contract much faster?\n\n{{item:3348}}  _**King of the Hill (KOTH)**_ {{item:3348}} \n\nAlso a really solid event. It does mean that the team with more AOE has a bit of a easier time but the capture mechanics alleviate the issue due to the capping team constantly taking damage as well as progress being halted if the point is being contested.\n\nI have yet to encounter a \"BS\" spawn for the point as it mostly seemed fair to both sides (never directly under a turret) but there have been some instances i heard of where that wasn't the case, a kink im sure as we move forward with Blitz will be addressed however.\n\n{{item:3348}}   _**Push the Cart**_ (~~GET ON THE DAMN PAYLOAD~~) {{item:3348}} \n\nReally fun. A event that tends to be easier for melee champions due to their larger HP pools (don't want to push the cart as a Lux for instance) but due to them being meele they are also more vulnerable to punishment in general. Really fun and neat.\n\nHowever there are some issues with the Tower target. It is really silly if you almost manage to push the turret just for a cannon minion or a random auto attack to destroy the turret forcing the cart to go further in. (i do see however why that mechanic is there, just a thought) There is also a strange interaction with {{champion:268}} passive. His passive turret counts as a allied structure so when he activates the turret as his own cart pushes by and the enemy just barely gets it, they are right under the \"nearest structure\". Winning the event.\n\nI don't consider this much of a issue but its a strange interaction when it happens for the first time. \n\nClosing thought about the cart event would be that i think perhaps a small buff of sorts could be applied for allies pushing along to incentive pushing as a full team. Maybe for each team member present people in the circle gain adaptive power for a bit. Just a random idea.\n\n{{item:3348}} **_Loot Teemo / Loot Veigar_** {{item:3348}} \n\nNeat little events respectively. The idea behind them seems interesting and allows for some really stressful interactions. However there are some issues. The money it awards are ridiculous at times (see the Mundo 1k expample) and it is very frustrating if the Teemo/Veigar waltzes into the enemy jungle or even towards turrets at times. It seems like it would be fairer if they were just patrolling up and down relatively in the middle but never go into the corner of the maps. \n\nI personally prefer Loot Veigar because of his ridiculous stuns (would be cool if he had a bar that counts down when he casts them so you can back off)\n\nAside the part where it wanders off into annoying directions this pair of events is really neat and tends to be fun. Im sure with some tweaks to the pathing this will be much more enjoable.\n\n{{item:3348}}  **_Snowball Fight_** aka. \"DUCK FOR COVER\" {{item:3348}} \n\n\nMany people have problems with this event mainly because it basically encourages you to sit back and start sniping from afar in hopes of landing that crucial snowball that wins the event. The slow chains are pretty annoying to deal with but reward for good aiming hence there is fairness in that as most of the time the snowballs themselves don't have THAT BS hit-boxes. I really love this one and wish it would come up more often. It turns the entire game into a tiptoeing game of paintball where you can even barrage on one poor unfortunate soul to unleash your avalanche. I also really love the penguins as a nice touch (I WISH THESE WERE POROS SO BADLY) *cough*\n\nThe Snowball Fight is really lovely and the music matches the tone. Even then, i have won many instances of that event by engaging the enemy team because most of the time they will be so focused on running away that they forgot to throw their (heh) _balls_ while you are in their face. Consider that more of a tipp than anything really.\n\n{{item:3348}}  _**Scuttle Racing**_ aka. MEEEEEEOOOOWW {{item:3348}} \n\n**THE BEST EVENT EVER.**\n\nI dont know why... there are so many champs that are way too strong for this mode. CC piling makes the event trivial and there are a couple of other instances where champions like Poppy or Singed can singlehandedly win this event for their team but something about the event announcement? GOSH \n\nHearing that MEEEEEEOW sound just makes me burst with joy whenever it happens. Please consider making all events somehow announced in a epic fashion. Make it so there are like Minions with scuttle fan shirts and flags waving on left and right side of the river in the middle. GOSH dang it i love scuttle racing so much.... despite it being imbalanced based on CC but Christ i want a Scuttle Racing Team Fan-shirt at my doorstep right NOW.\n\nWhere was i...\n\nah yeah. Scuttle Racing. Its fun, really is. Issue being CC Stacking but that is simply a minor issue to me and does not ruin the entire event for me.\n\n\n{{champion:10}} **ONWARD TO THE REWARDS!** {{champion:10}} \n\n\n_**Blessing of {{champion:16}} **_\n\nReasonable Reward.

It makes the game incredibly frustrating and even when i get it on my team i roll my eyes because i know that buff is basically just free damage, nothing more, nothing less. Free damage you can't avoid (unless you are Fizz ect. ofc) \n\nUnlike the other buffs you can't really play around this one and it just instills suffering and lowers the mood on the receiving end. Make maybe time based or run on a limited ammo system. (Like 2 or 3 shots per tower or any other number) so you can have some strategy (drain ammo to get rid of the buff then engage) ect. \n\nIt seems like a neat addition but really needs some reworking to not feel overbearing and frustrating.\n\n_**Blessing of {{summoner:31}} **_ (Catapult of Champions)\n\nYES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES.\n\nTHIS\n\nIS\n\nTHE BEST. \n\nThis is by far the most interesting and funniest buff in the entire mode right now.

(A field i always loved dipping into).\n\nIn closing thank you for giving us this new fresh Leauge Mode.\n\nLets make Blitz the Best Mode it can be!!!\n\n(I really wanna become a Nexus Blitz Main)\n\nStay sweet!\n\n- SweetyBuns","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"imp1313","date":"2018-09-04T16:42:56.990+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"sudden death change -> .\n\ninstead of having sudden death be a nexus have sd spawn big ole fatty monsters that help each team  push the base . have them ignore each other and travel toward enemy base  . immune to any and all cc , slow , displacement effects .\nwhen a  siege golem is killed its nexus takes a flat amount of damage . i like that they have skills , attacks , and fight back .\n\ni feel that this would be more intuitive than the current - lose teamfight lose game no matter how well you have done in the match .\ncurrent sd is not objective based . it is a single fight that determines the game -- which goes directly against the theme of events and the rest of the game .","replies":[]},{"poster":"DragonFruitBunny","date":"2018-09-03T21:37:39.937+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Consider a buff to {{champion:75}} . Ever since the Stack revert, you either have to farm hard to keep up in stacks but it makes it hard against champs like Yasuo or mages to easily bully {{champion:75}}  out. Without a proper team, he can't necessarily stack at all. I've generally on average if I ignore my whole team for 12 minutes I'd get around 300-400 stacks. Maybe 100-300 if I get bullied out by champions like Teemo, or Brand. Full stacking {{champion:75}}  is in my opinion not viable since there will be multiple team fights during events or in the jungle if {{champion:75}}  is not there his team will lose to a 4v5. And if he does help he'll lose out on stacks. Of course, you can build tanky for your team since tank {{champion:75}}  is the meta build but it's not as fun as going a more heavy damage build which Nexus Blitz is about fun. I'd like to see some kind of stats buff to compensate his Q nerf. Maybe increase his armor or mr per level to help him get through lane phase or buff his Q base stats so he doesn't have to farm as much and help his team out.","replies":[{"poster":"AD Yuumi","date":"2018-09-04T03:51:29.391+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll likely buff his stats if he's suffering after nerfing his staccs.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Dapunzo Is Back","date":"2018-09-03T21:06:51.308+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Here some feedbacks from me (played almost 2/3 games on nexus blittz a day):\n\n1.  **Blessing of Caitlyn** and **Blessing of Blitz** are too op actually: the first one almost shots every champ who is not tank (actually it deals the 65% life or more as dmg to Jinx) so this clearly makes impossible to win a game after the enemy team gets this reward; nerfing it or making it lasting 1:30 mins instead of all the game. For the Blitz's one is actually unclear where the grab comes from (sometimes it's bugged and you literally can't see the arm coming to you) so improving the graphics may give players more chance to dodge it (or it's another secure death). \n2. The team who win the first event wins the game (it happened almost everytime in my games): the early rewards are too strong and there is no possible comeeback from there. I understand that the games have to last at max 15 mins but wheen you know it's lost from minute 4 it's annoying keep playing (as you can't even surrend at minute 4).\n3. Just **destroy Herald buff** please. It gives baron buff to the minion _and_ the Herald too. Basically it's free win once you get it and the team who won the first event usually gets it without any contest.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Eeyore","date":"2018-09-03T18:49:24.387+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can we add some of the Brawler items, such as Typhoon Claws and Trickster's Glass?\n\nAlso, the preseason item that never got released, Spellbreaker, would be super cool.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PapaGreg21","date":"2018-09-03T15:45:38.282+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello.
