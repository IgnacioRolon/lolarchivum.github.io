Needs Bans.\n2. Needs shorter respawn timers.\n3. Games feel extremely one-sided.\n4. The events need to be reworked. Sometimes an event essentially just gives the reward to one team or the other (teemo spawns and moves into their side of the map. battle royale centers on their turret).\n5. Event rewards need to be balanced. Some event rewards are basically an auto win. The shield and guardian angel ones are more or less impossible for the other team to overcome (unless they were already way ahead, but then they probably wouldn't have lost the event). Losing because of the first event but having to play out the rest of the game feels so bad. Winning because of it feels rather empty.\n6. Games being decided by rng leads to tons of toxicity.","replies":[{"poster":"Vexilus","date":"2018-08-15T23:41:07.283+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":4,"body":"as a point to point \n\n 1.  I understand the desire for bans, but it's meant as a for fun gamemode bans would both increase the time to get into what is a really short game. and lead to dodges if people don't get the champ they want. It just doesn't fit in this gamemode\n2.  I agree somewhat, they should be a little shorter early and reduced a bit later. In this really fast gamemode waiting around 30 seconds to respawn isn't fun\n\n3. I agree completely. While I understand it was to be a little skewed to increase the pace of the game. The games I've played both between live and pbe one team has a least 5 or 6 kills before the first event starts. And depending on what event spawns first if they win that event and get cursed minions/ GA/ or the Shield games feel rather impossible to come back from. \n\n4.  There's been a lot of changes to spawn locations for these events on the pbe, but essentially this happens because one team is ahead of the other by a fair amount. At the very least it is rather borish when teemo spawns inside their jungle, rather it would be nice if instead it spawns in field and just paths through the losing teams jungle first (teemo does eventually move from one jungle to the other)\n\n5.  I feel that there needs to be more whimsical rewards like the cannon and the blitz hooks. Those are fun rewards that don't completely shut out a team. I think GA is okay because it has a timer. The shield is outright broken, as it gives you essentially a second health bar that doens't go away. The shield should decay over a period of 90 seconds since that's how long GA lasts. The rewards should be interesting and less overpowering.\n\n6. There's not much to say on this point as the entire game mode is based on rng events. removing that just turns it into a fast SR which would get boring fast. The game being decided by rng isn't in itself bad as long as the rng is fun and not because of the points mentioned in point 5.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ataraxas","date":"2018-08-15T19:35:41.816+0000","up_votes":42,"down_votes":6,"body":"**1. Jungling feels useless in Nexus Blitz**\nThere's only one place you can gank from in the first lane and you aren't even connected to the second one. Not to mention there's is nothing even in the jungle except camps. And even then, you're dependant on your duo jng to get those camps. Yes there is red buff and blue buff to fight over but it's still just meh and doesn't equate to destroying turrets. As for rift herald it's moreso an entire team thing.\n\n**2. Death timers need to be reduced**\nGiven how snowbally and damage-filled nexus blitz is, deathtimers should not go anywhere above 15-20 seconds.\n\n**3. Fighters feel terrible to play in Nexus Blitz**\nThey can't split push\nSoloing jng objectives is harder\nThey can't duel\nLarge fights are their weakness and it's always a large fight in nexus siege.\nIn the very rare instance someone does engage in a duel it turns into a large fight in mere seconds anyways.\n\n**4. General Feedback on Nexus Blitz**\nIt doesn't do a good job of taking away the SR/TT feel for burnt out players who want something different. It feels like just a more chaotic version of TT + quicker version of SR. Dominion for example did a great job of introducing a completely different playstyle for players who were burnt out on normals, this on the other hand keeps the many same elements of a normal LoL game so it doesn't feel too refreshing/different. Once you get over the shock of being in a new map with events it gets pretty boring.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ThotsOfMobyHuge","date":"2018-08-15T21:57:50.623+0000","up_votes":32,"down_votes":2,"body":"Feedback: when the nexuses start walking.... plz make it impossible to back door the actual nexuses. i just lost a game because of that","replies":[{"poster":"warpenguin555","date":"2018-08-15T23:29:45.637+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":2,"body":"Wait you can actually do that?

It was also small enough for you to have a good amount of full teamfights. It was a really well sized and designed map. Nexus Blitz feels too cramped, especially with all of the mobility in the game these days. A 1v1 or 2v2 very quickly turns into a 4v4 or 5v5. If I wanted a small map with pretty much 100% teamfights I'd stick to ARAM. There isn't enough space between the lanes. They're so close together it was easy to lead two lanes of creeps to the middle and have both lanes share gold/exp. I'm sure there are game design arguments to be made on why that is a good or bad thing but I'll just say that it felt pretty lame.\n\nAnother thing I liked about Dominion was the non-standard objectives and goals. Capture and hold points, cool and very different from SR. Here? It's SR but smaller and once, _maybe_ twice, a game you get some little fun meme event. The events are fun, but I wish they were the focus of the mode rather than just \"lane like normal until something interesting happens.\" I'd be real interested in what would happen if you took these fun side events and put them in Dominion.\n\nAlso my games have felt very one sided. Not sure if that's just how it goes when a new mode is released and matchmaking hasn't quite placed everyone where they belong, or whether that has something to do with the mode but there it is.\n\nOverall I like Nexus Blitz slightly more than SR but that isn't saying much considering I kinda hate SR haha. I've always liked the side modes more than SR, and I've always been bummed at how poorly Dominion and Twisted Treeline have been treated over the years. I love that you guys are trying new maps/modes, and I really love that you're trying stuff on live rather than just PBE. That on it's own is wonderful. So if nothing else thanks for all of this, keep it up dudes.\n\nP.S.\nBring back Dominion.\n\nEDIT: Also the King of the hill event on top of one team's turret is the worst thing ever. Please put this event in neutral ground.","replies":[{"poster":"Lasthuar","date":"2018-08-20T23:50:02.225+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"Just bring back dominion...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kaisa Aran","date":"2018-08-16T19:12:04.458+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"Heavily agree on the map being too cramped, I'm getting pretty sick of having to deal with constant 1v2/1v3s because lanes are so close together.

I've played 5 games on live and every game so far the losing team has surrendered. Which to me sounds like a sign of trouble if winning means the enemy team surrendering rather than you blowing up the nexus\n\n2. As a second point to the first while it is meant to be a fast game one team each game ends up snowballing super early even before the \"on-fire\" buff kicks in since many of the early fighting results in kills split among 2 to 3 people. This skews the events in favor of the team already ahead which puts them even further ahead leading to a dissatisfying game for the losing team. \n\n\nI think to fix some of these issues\n- Kill and assist gold should be reduced \n      by how much i don't know, but reducing it will allow for a gold advantage but not so much an item advantage before the first event \n\n- increase the damage taken on people who are \"on-fire\" by 2% for each take down they get while \"on-fire\"\n      in one of my games I got the \"on-fire\" buff on lux (who's pretty op) and with her high range and burst I essentially never found myself in a situation where the enemy team could kill me. I feel as though if you continually increase the damage you take as you rake in more kills/assists the enemy team will eventually be able to shut you down and bank the catch up gold which would help even out the game\n\nOn a final note, on the pbe there was a situation where both teams were fairly even and reached the sudden death event. But because our team died mere seconds before the event started the enemy team was able to kill the walking nexus before any of us respawned. It would be nice if similar to bardle royale all dead players respawned when the event starts. since both teams would be relatively even for it to reach that point. it would be (and was) extremely dissatisfying to be stuck in gray screen just watching as the enemy team took down the walking nexus with no effort or contest.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AD Yuumi","date":"2018-08-17T22:08:03.584+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi friends,\nThanks for all the feedback.  As of right now the first Nexus Blitz micropatch is live.  We'll likely do another on Monday.\n\nOur initial balance patch is going to be looking at a few champions who are balance outliers (very weak or very strong), as well as make the on-fire buff less favorable to ranged champions.\n\nSome notes on overall balance trends:\n----Initial winrate spread looks decent - Almost all champions fall between 44-58% winrate.  Compared to the 35-70% spread that ARAM and URF can have at times, this is very good.\n----TONS of champions are viable in the jungle, including a lot of marksmen, mages, and supports.\n----AoE control mages, poke mages, and tanks look a bit strong. Bruisers and Assassins look a bit weak.  We'll keep monitoring this and see if class changes are in order for future patches.\n----We're hitting Taric and Sona because they seem significantly stronger than other members of their class (enchanters/supports).\n\n\nChanges Below:\n\n> **ON-FIRE BUFF**\n> Mana regen :: 100 MP/5 >>> 50 MP/5\n> Ranged champions increase to damage taken :: 25% >>> 35%\n> \n> **RUNES**\n> Transcendence\n> Level to turn on :: 6 >>> 8\n> \n> Gathering Storm\n> Rank up time :: 4min >>> 4.5min\n> \n> **CHAMPION BUFFS**\n> Nasus\n> Q stacking :: 6 per last hit (12 vs champs and large minions/monsters)  >>> 9 per last hit (18 vs champs and large minions/monsters)\n> \n> Tristana\n> AD :: 61 + 3.11/lvl >>> 65 + 4/lvl\n> AS :: 1.5%/lvl >>> 2.5%/lvl\n> HP :: 559 >>> 610\n> \n> Kalista\n> AD :: 3.6/lvl >>> 4.5/lvl\n> HP :: 534 >>> 600\n> Mana :: 231 >>> 300\n> \n> Xayah\n> AD :: 60 + 2.9/lvl >>> 65 + 3.5/lvl\n> HP :: 561 >>> 600\n> \n> Tryndamere\n> AS/lvl :: 2.9 >>> 4\n> AD :: 3.7/lvl >>> 4.5/lvl\n> HP :: 98/lvl >>> 110/lvl\n> \n> Warwick\n> HP/lvl :: 85 >>> 100\n> AS/lvl :: 2.3% >>> 3.5%\n> AD/lvl :: 3 >>> 4\n> \n> **CHAMPION NERFS**\n> Sona\n> HP/lvl :: 77 >>> 60\n> Amor/lvl :: 3.3 >>> 3\n> \n> Taric\n> HP/lvl :: 90 >>> 75\n> AR/lvl :: 3.4 >>> 3","replies":[]},{"poster":"GalacticaQT","date":"2018-08-17T21:47:01.080+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":8,"body":"Maybe lengthen the amount of time played before being eligible for FF?","replies":[{"poster":"Kaisa Aran","date":"2018-08-17T22:05:06.669+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":12,"body":"I'll stop playing this gamemode if they do that, I'd rather not be held hostage by silvers with 'never surrender' mentalities.

It's the most awkward event because there's this sudden incentive to stop dealing damage so that there are targets for snowballs.\n\nThe bardle royale ring has to not center near any turrets. It feels cheesy when the center happens to be on their indestructible turret.\n\nAllowing the experimental items on Nexus Blitz feels weird. The old items aren't balanced and are either underwhelming(lantern) or overpowered(force of nature). Some new items could be acceptable on Summoner's Rift but they're exclusive to Nexus Blitz. Atma's Reckoning is an item I looked forward to on juggernauts but it's not on Summoner's Rift.\n\nThe game is faster paced and summoner spells have a reduced cooldown. However, warding totems feel like they lag behind the rest of the game. \n\nNexus Blitz feels sufficiently different from other game modes. I can see it being a permanent addition with some more polish. Nexus Blitz is faster paced and more chaotic than any other game mode. The map is really small and the entire northern part of the map has no vision. The small bushes spread everywhere make for good hiding places.\n\nA caveat is that while Nexus Blitz is a faster game mode, something more appealing to Eastern audiences, it's also more silly. The game mode is too chaotic to be taken seriously and I can't envision a ranked environment where spontaneous events are central to the gameplay. Nexus Blitz appeals to players looking for a fast and lighthearted game. In this way, Nexus Blitz appeals to the same audience as ARURF. The developers have spent time trying to differentiate Nexus Blitz from other permanent game modes but there are similarities to the rotating game modes.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Say NO to FF","date":"2018-08-16T15:34:34.762+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Feedback:\n\nAOE based champion are bit hard to handle due to confined space example Brand, Zyra, ziggs - I found it hard to reach them without ghost walker but even then can't kill 1 of them alone when they have 2-4 people trying to protect them.

For Battle Royale everyone should be forced respawned, if you are losing the game aka enemy is face rolling you and Battle Royale starts then most of the time it ends up being a 3 v 5 or 3 v 4,etc vs an enemy who is already ahead in terms of items and buffs.\n\n2. Loot the teemo should not walk into enemy team's or own team's jungle turret, as that is just hard to contest when there is a turret firing at you.\n\n3. GA and Jaana shields are too strong!

I have yet to see consistency with it\nI think ward CD should be shorter, but only allow one place per champ.

Like it could start at 1, gaining another charge every 4 mins.\n\nEvents/rewards in particular:\n90s GA and the BF shield are way too big, especially with there being no rhyme or reason to what events reward what buffs. A team managing to walk the cart not only gets a free tower, but then gets 5 GAs on top of it? WHY\n---These are particularly bad if they're given out when a game is pretty even but a team happens to win an event, yet to see a game not snowball out of control when the GA or BF shield get given right away.\nLocations for events spawn more central, and when on the losing close to but not under the permanent tower. As it stands, having a KotH event right next to your nexus rarely impacts things, and early on having a ring of fire event spawn on a enemy tower when you maybe have 2 kills on them is just dumb.\n\n\nThe events themselves I like, just their locations and randomness/strength of buffs need some changes.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dethflash","date":"2018-08-17T19:22:55.577+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"King of the hill, ring of fire, loot teemo, all need to be in no mans land.

I'm a real big fan of the idea and I think it's a super fun addition. It kinda feels like a weird (in a good way!) mix between everything I like in the rotating game modes with a new map. I only have a few issues with it, but here they are:\n\n1. **The placement of the buffs,** blue buff in particular, **feels awkward.** This could just be me, but sometimes it feels like it's a massive clown fiesta trying to get to the buffs, specifically, blue buff. Also, I would push red buff back a bit more to allow more visibility of the enemy if they choose to engage the buff in its pit. It feels a little strange attempting to engage an enemy who is engaging the buff because, due to the placement of the bushes and the buff relative to me, it feels like they have a huge sight advantage, both with and without wards, which brings me to my next point...\n2. **The bushes appear extremely thin and it is very hard to tell what is/is not a part of the bush.** In Summoner's rift, it's very clear where the bush ends and begins, even without your mouse highlighting the area. I don't see why it should be any different for Nexus Blitz.  Also, there are some spots (I believe next to the turrets in the middle lane, for example) where there are tiny bushes right in front of it. I firmly believe that these bushes either need to be moved away from the turret and made larger or taken out entirely. \n3. **There needs to be balancing between the events and the rewards possible for the events.** Moving a payload from one point to another that is barely even far from the first is not the type of thing that I would give a Guardian Angel to, nor is fighting and winning in a very close battle royale the type of thing that I would associate with a very temporary ocean drake. I think that perhaps certain rewards should only be available during certain events in order to create an incentive for players to want to win them, besides the obvious incentive of \"_maybe_ I'll get something good if I win this event\"\n4. **The bottom lane is...kinda useless?** Since it's the farthest away from the nexus, the farthest away from the jungle, and the most hassle to take, it more often than not gets forgotten in the games I've played. I think this mode would benefit from a more focused map where laners don't have to wander aimlessly between the action and (more often than not) nothing. It would make it feel more action packed, and it would probably make the game go faster, since players have to focus on just one lane instead of, what is to me, a lane and a half.\n\nAll in all I really like this mode! I quit playing league as much recently, so it's really nice to come back to something super refreshing and promising like this!\n\nIn response to the idea that this mode needs bans, personally, I disagree! I think being able to choose whatever you want in whatever role you want is important, even if it means seeing certain champions more often than others.\n\nKeep up the good work! c:","replies":[]},{"poster":"RemiBloodWolf","date":"2018-08-16T22:12:08.034+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"1.

Also, their nexus actually went all the way to our base and got stuck in our base so we could easily burn it down.
