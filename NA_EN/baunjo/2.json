{"poster":"Baunjo","date":"2015-01-11T00:25:27.899+0000","title":"The Melee Adc","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"It's getting really old playing with people who don't understand assassins whatsoever. \n\nI have been on both sides of the equation MANY TIMES, playing the assassin myself with teammates who don't know how to synergize with them and playing against one and my team refusing to attempt counter play, so please don't pull the \"You don't understand this concept either.\" \n\nTo start, let's just give a quick overview and explanation of an assassin.\n\nAn Assassin is a champion who excels at dealing incredible DPS, some of them to often 1 champion but also many who can utterly slaughter the enemy team. In addition, their kit includes 1 or more means of survivability for both dueling scenarios or when partaking in TEAMfights.\n\nNow this is where people start getting confused. \"So there's just no weakness to Assassins is there?!\" The answer is no, there is a common weakness to them, just like every other champion type.\n\n1). Squishiness. \n\nIf you haven't noticed, AD Carries tend to build nothing but damage, making them very very easy to kill, but also allowing them to do very good damage to others. the MAJORITY of assassins are no exception. Squishy.\n\n2) Range\n\nIncluded in the issue of having low health and defensive stats, most of the champions i am referring to are MELEE. In order to do this ludicrous damage they have to be in the targets face, or else they are wasting damage potential. \n\n3) Survivability.\n\nUnderstand that just because the champion has something to keep them alive doesn't mean there is no way of dealing with it. A few examples:\n\n{{champion:11}} W can be canceled by disrupts, as with his ultimate, which only grants immunity to slows.\n\n{{champion:55}} try and keep vision on her for teamfights and make sure if you have a stun, use it when she casts her ult or silence her when she uses her E to close the gap to the fight.\n\n{{champion:84}} No exception to the previous 2. use cc to delay burst so your team can either kill her or deal enough damage to where it is foolish for her to stay. also carry a pink ward for her w.\n\n{{champion:91}} Same concept as Akali. Pink wards and cc. hes still squishy.\n\n{{champion:238}} His kill and outplay potential is lowered drastically without his ultimate. Use items like zhonyas{{item:3157}} , QSS{{item:3140}} , any form of shield, to negate the damage from his ultimate and it means not only is that 120/100/80 CD ability now on CD, he most likely did not trade a kill for it. Therefore, play more aggressive knowing this and push for objectives. In addition, assuming the player is not that practiced at using every ability in under 2 seconds, a tank should be able to peal for his carry and even result in a kill.\n\nThese are just a few champions i enjoy playing that fall under this category. Again the point of this section is to exploit the weakness and counter play for each champion, although not every method is listed.\n\nNow the information given is not just useful for counter play, it is also valuable information for the team with the assassin. By knowing how an assassin is played and the weaknesses of said champion they can play accordingly, function in fights better, make objective decisions, snowball lanes early, etc.\n\nTherefore the success of an Assassin all comes down to the skill and knowledge of the 10 players on the map. Not just that specific player.\n\nThe most recent example I can give of this is a recent master yi game i played. My team had almost no cc, meaning no ways of keeping targets suppressed for me to do damage. At that point I have 2 options:\n\n1) Splitpush\n2) Obtain Korean level reflexes to dodge cc within that game\n3) Cry harder\n\nSplit pushing was not an option. My team refused to not follow through on fights 4v5 while I was elsewhere, making our early and mid game lead non existent. After them flaming me because I wasn't completely destroying fights, i made 3 attempts at fighting, all of which were unsuccessful. If I were to wait for the fight to progress and the enemy to blow cc, my team would be dead. If I went in, i might delete 1 person before dying myself.\n\nWhat is the moral of this rather all over the place discussion? The LOL community needs to be educated on all champion roles, not just assassins. This includes working together in champion select so that the team can accomplish necessary tasks as efficiently as possible. Also understand how to both counter play this role, as well as compliment it in order to use the full potential of its use.\n\nI could be wrong though, maybe every player in the world who enjoys champions like this needs to just be faker. \n\nThanks NA,\n\nBaunjo\n\n(P.S. the title should be the assassin not melee adc it wont let me change :/\nP.P.S do not bother commenting your thoughts if you plan to just try and correct me on in game terms and the exact definition of the concept or until youve read the entire passage.\n\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"TheKingDodo","date":"2015-01-11T00:35:02.220+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are very few melee adcs in this game.
