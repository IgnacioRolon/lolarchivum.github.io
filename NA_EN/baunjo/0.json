I don't think I lose because \" my backpack just isn't big enough \" or any other typical excuse for playing poorly. Ever game I attempt to further the teams play by staying positive, thinking ahead, and even giving advice to areas that are struggling, and I find that people tend to ignore help. Whether you think so or not winning a game by yourself is not realistic, and bad teammates do exist. Is every game I lose due to my teammates? Hell no, but the majority of them are indeed the result of toxic behavior, negativity and refusal to communicate or lack of an open mind to find problems.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-06-26T01:45:13.875+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"I was in Gold V last season, and if I remember correctly, I went 5-5 in my provisionals and placed in Silver II.","replies":[{"poster":"ARainySundae","date":"2015-06-26T06:03:59.807+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"D; i miss you nami player you deleted me i am heartbroken </3","replies":[]},{"poster":"BlacksSmokeCrack","date":"2015-06-26T02:05:34.848+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot KateyKhaos,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=vmpmpXnN,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-06-26T01:45:13.875+0000)\n>\n> I was in Gold V last season, and if I remember correctly, I went 5-5 in my provisionals and placed in Silver II.\n\nlmao silver...\n\nGive up.","replies":[{"poster":"LSD LobsterMoney","date":"2015-06-26T06:08:11.921+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cause you are gold I doesnt mean you get to splash other peoples dream of trying to get higher elo, it just shows how mean you can be, oh and btw you still have a long way to be a ''pro'', gl on ranked","replies":[]},{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-06-26T17:02:53.149+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm actually Plat V now. :3","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"codeman9999","date":"2015-06-27T00:34:54.879+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly I want to play SR and ranked but I feel id just cause the team to lose.

Play normals and learn every role, not that you have to like them, but just learn them. Also try and have atleast 5 champions per role that you play WELL, they dont have to be perfect and you dont have to like them but you need to be flexible in ranked. Another important thing is watching streamers and youtubers that give good commentary. One of my favorite youtubers to watch for LoL advice is FoxDropLoL because I main jungle and he is very good. Finally, though the thread is not perfect, search for my thread called \" Objective Control \" and read that thoroughly, it will give you an idea of how to work towards bringing a game to a close and the concept of trading objectives.","replies":[{"poster":"codeman9999","date":"2015-06-28T01:14:03.343+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, I would like to say thank you for the advice.
