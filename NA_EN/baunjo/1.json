Though upvotes/downvotes dont make a difference to me, this isn&#039;t facebook, instagram, twitter or what have you. If you upvote, please share why. If you downvote, please share why. Thanks!\r\n\r\nThough I could be wrong on this, I believe one of the incentives of the new ranked system was that it was too difficult to set up a ranked team of 5 when you wanted to play ranked with friends. I agree completely, though I only really tried to make a ranked team maybe 4 times, I had success only 1 time with getting a team together. I think we can all agree it was not easy to do that.\r\n\r\nHowever there is underlying issues here. For those of you who successfully did that, I could really use your incite here but I recall the system being something like this:\r\n\r\n* Players play through 10 provisional games to figure out how good the created team truly is, regardless of how good any of the players on that team are.\r\n\r\n* Players share the same MMR while queing with the team\r\n\r\n* The TEAM&#039;s rank will go up, not their individual solo/duo que rank.\r\n\r\nSo why was this so successful when you actually got your team together and played?\r\n\r\nLets say you had a plat friend on your team with a bunch of silver players. For the most part, the plat player is expected to carry games with other silver players because they are overall a better player. At first, that doesn&#039;t sound fair. But If the team plays against lower players consistently and wins, they will slowly be placed with better ones at a steady rate.\r\n\r\nAlthough I believe you cannot play with someone who is more than a whole division above your rank currently, there is still a huge margin in those statistics. After all, there is a big difference between a diamond 5 player and a platinum 5 player, and you will play anyone within that threshold, and potentially higher.\r\n\r\nSo my point?\r\n\r\n**Players do not consistently get better and improve at the same rate based on their rank, nor does the MMR improve at the same rate.**\r\n\r\nI understand that the current &quot; matchmaking guide &quot; does say that players will be eventually placed in an MMR according to the skill of the current team. But even when that does happen, they still lose and gain LP at the same rate than they would if they played alone, only adding in the potential variable of an already existing MMR gap in the team.\r\n\r\nSO lets say you play with a specific team for a few games and never play with those players again. For that duration, you get the most inconsistently matched games against solo, duo, trio, and so on until, when exactly? You have to play a lot of games with the same people for that to work. So then, why would you remove the only system that would actually match them with a fair set of opponents and actually increase their skill as a whole?\r\n\r\nSo I ask:","replies":[{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2016-06-16T14:40:10.242+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Problem with your poll is, a lot of people \"enjoy dynamic queue\" and play in premades often but do not \"play with the same people consistently\".\n\nI usually go into Ranked in Duo/Trio, without Voice Coms set up and with a different guy each day.

This way the actual league you are in still wont be relevent for your solo skill and people will continue to have a problem with it. :/. In a way the whole MMR concept and league requiring promos to jump up makes it difficult to deal with the boosting issue.\n\nThat way playing alone and playing in a team results in different level of opponents, if people are just using it to play with friends there will be no problems unless you choose to play with a much worse friend sometimes.","replies":[{"poster":"Baunjo","date":"2016-06-16T15:43:25.287+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The issue isn't MMR.

Usually we had 3 or 4 and we were trying to find another or we were forced to wait for someone to finish their current game.  This wasted a lot of time where now we can just que up as 3 or 4 instead.

We created team comps around who could play which champions best and devised strategies to win.  \n\nI would be willing play ranked 5s if it was brought back but they would have to aleviate the struggle of finding more people.

You could bring back ranked teams, and make changes to ranked team so they follow all the same rules of club ranked, and call it ranked teams, and you'd have the same ranked queue. But then you've basically got two different kinds of clubs, one of which (ranked teams) is strictly superior, so why do clubs evne exist any more? Or, why not just combine them?\n\nClubs, like ranked 5's (and honor, and hextech, and....) are a system that has huge potential that's currently not being realized very well. I felt their potential could be better realized if we combined them with ranked teams.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Mandang0","date":"2016-06-14T18:28:56.320+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's an interesting concept, but I think it's still very flawed.
