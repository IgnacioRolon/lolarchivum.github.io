They remade the game but it counted as a loss on my provisionals. I believe this is completely unfair. If anything, it should not be counted.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-25T21:25:45.574+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"The [/Remake System](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/208754686--Remake-FAQ) marks anyone who is inactive for 90 seconds or more within the first 3 minutes of the match. If someone becomes marked, a /Remake will become available at 3:00 and the affected team will vote for the remake. If the remake passes, all players marked by the system will receive a loss for the match.\n\nIn this case, it seems the system acted appropriately, since any type of disconnection, regardless of intention, negatively impacts everyone in the match. Let me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]}]}
