Thank you for the feedback.\n\nI'm not trying to be rude, but I don't understand how whiskers would result in the removal of \"stronger and powerful\" from the skin. Her stance and VO alone already do that.\n\nThe fox-like features (ears, whiskers, tails) are synonymous with Ahri - Arcade Ahri didn't have the whiskers on her splash art, but was later added due to this. \n\nMaybe it's because the ears, whiskers, and tails are on every Ahri skin that it just very noticeable when it's missing.","replies":[{"poster":"Valor Bot","date":"2017-08-09T22:58:24.592+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think I understand why; Ahri's whiskers are usually textured on which gives the appearance of face paint.

Make's her less fox like by just the slightest slightest eachtime Sooo one could in fact argue that she has taken so many souls along with being a star guardian thus speeding up the process making her look a little more human then usual. Now of course you can argue \"WELP if she's so damn powerful why isn't she human?\" To which My thought process on that is..she is still Ahri, it's theoretically possible after  being a star guardian she doens't desire as many souls and sustains her own well of power via the star light thus well she has become more human she still retains her vastayan core traits. OR simple answer \"it still has to be Ahri.\" But all i'm arguing in this stance isn't so much as common sense of \"why\" but more of a \"Cause\" if were talking lore/story sense why she doesn't have whiskers.

Thank you for the feedback.\n\n\" The whiskers were removed to make the thematic and her aesthetic to be stronger and powerful.\"\n\nSo removing  something from someone make them even more powerful? I guess you guys could do a little lore about this skin, that show Ahri \"sacrifice\" her whiskers(temporary)  to unlock the Star Guardian's power.\n----------------\n\nThe ruler of stars(the one who gave the powers to the Guardian Star(Ezreal, Lux, Ahri, Jinx, MF,Poppy, and hopefully soon Urgot) asked in return a sacrifice from Ahri.\n\n\"Now Ahri, it is your turn  to sacrifice something.\"\n\n_Ahri's mind was preoccupied by this hard decision. She had to sacrifice a part of her to gain a new power to help her defeat the enemies. At last, her nose twitched and her whiskers moved along. Ahri decided to sacrifice her whiskers._\n\n\"Very well.\" _The ruler of stars rise his fingers and touch Ahri's whiskers. She felt an astronomous amount of energy within her whiskers and now stored within her body._ \n\n\"From this point, each time you call upon the power of the Star Guardian(by touching your whiskers), your whiskers will retract within your skin, and unlock the power of the Star Guardian. After the battle, the power of the Star Guardian will be stored back within your body, and your whiskers will grow back.\"\n\n\"I, the ruler of star, declare Ahri as a Star Guardian!\"\n\n_Ahri felt stronger than before._ (gooooo Zeo). \n\n\"Great powers come with sacrifices.\"\n\n-----------------------------\n\nI do not know about the lore of the skin, or the lore of Star Guardians. But hopefully, you get the idea.\n\nPS: I know, my english is most likely the worse that you've seen...
