The rest is really just practice. \nA few mechanical tips (you have probably seen these already):\nTry to hit targets at the very end of your Q range when they are going to CS, making it hard for them to dodge both hits.\nWait slightly before using spells after a dash, people often panic-trigger any dashes, flash or defensive abilities if something suddenly zooms at them. Wait half a second until you can tell where they are going.\nMindgame people with spirit rush. 10 seconds is a long time in a team fight, people will often forget that you have one charge left.\nUse spirit rush. It has a really short cooldown, especially if you max CDR (you should). Just use it any time someone is out of place.\nWard, and get a blue trinket if nobody else has one. Spirit rush is great for ambushing people over walls and retreating safely.\n\nSome situational items i have found useful: \n{{item:3100}} Very late-game item, after deathcap, the turret siege ability it gives you allows you to splitpush and the movespeed is very useful. Also great for kiting damage, as spirit rush triggers spellblade. If you stagger spirit rush, you can be looking at an extra 1500-2000 magic damage over the course of a duel.\n{{item:3102}} Veigar and shit like that. Your DPS is 0 when dead, so this is a great damage-boosting item.\n{{item:3152}}  I hear this is good, but have never really used it. Just another dash to mindgame people with.\nIf you reach a point where you can sell boots and get a 6th item, it should be ludens or lichbane, in that order, as the movespeed loss will be small.\n\nStuff you should never even think about building, no matter what anyone says: {{item:3151}} {{item:3010}} {{item:3115}} {{item:3003}}\n\nAlso try ADC ahri at some point, it is hilarious and strangely effective.","replies":[]},{"poster":"l not Faker l","date":"2017-01-07T20:12:35.570+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So watch Faker :)","replies":[]}]}
