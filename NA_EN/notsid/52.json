You really messed up big time, Riot. What you did is disgusting and has no place here. If you hold a panel or event, it must be open to everyone.\r\n\r\nThe only case of advanced entry I can understand would be those with wheelchairs or other mobility aids, so that they can be allowed to be seated/sorted out more easily, or a special line where people paid specifically to get in first.\r\n\r\nBut based on gender?

Blacks welcome after 6:30&quot; and this garbage?\r\n\r\nYou just went back decades of progress.\r\nGood job.","replies":[]}
