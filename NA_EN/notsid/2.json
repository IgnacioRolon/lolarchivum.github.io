Post here to have your name in my playthrough!","subforum":"General Discussion","up_votes":6,"down_votes":7,"body":"I did this before when R/B/Y were released in the VC and people seemed to enjoy it, so I&#039;m doing it again now that Gold and Silver are out on virtual console. \n\n**PLEASE HAVE YOUR FIRST POST IN THIS THREAD START OFF IN BIG BOLD LETTERS TO MAKE IT EASY FOR ME TO SEE WHILE SCROLLING THROUGH.** Chatter is welcome in here, but it gets difficult to keep track of as this thread fills up so just make your first post in here stand out.\n\nRules:\n\n1. Your post order determines what Pokemon you get. In other words, the first person to post here gets to be my starter (no, you can&#039;t pick it).\n\n2. Only ONE Pokemon will be named after you. No matter how many times you post, you only get ONE.\n\n3. Please have your name fit the character limit (10). If your name exceeds that limit, please shorten it if possible or pick an alternate name that&#039;s acceptable.\n\n4. Again.. PLEASE MAKE YOUR FIRST POST STAND OUT IN SOME WAY. SAY WUBBA LUBBA DUB DUB IN BOLD IF YOU WANT, IDK.\n\nLet the games begin!!\n\n**Edit**\n\nTo make this a little cooler, I'm going to be providing little updates as I progress through my game and add to my collection of Pokemon. Each time I get to the bottom of a page here in the thread, I'll bump the thread and add a little update with who I've got in my party, where I'm at in the game, what trainers or gyms I've just beaten, etc. Fun stuff!!","replies":[]}
