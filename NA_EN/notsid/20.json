What, you need more money for eSports, so now you have to prey on the type of person that would gamble compulsively? The fact that you can spend real life money on RP, use that RP to buy a chest with random loot, and have that loot have a chance to be 100% worthless to the person.. is gambling. There&#039;s no two ways about it. You are introducing gambling into a T rated game. I&#039;m pretty sure that&#039;s.. actually against the law. Or if not the law, then at least against the ESRB policies or whatever.\r\n\r\nDo you really think teens are going to be responsible when it comes to gambling? Or what about people with gambling problems? What good can come of this horrible Hextech Crafting system?\r\n\r\nThe only way to fix this is to completely remove all possibilities of spending RP on any Hextech items. Make it all 100% loot drops from playing the game. Make it so you can&#039;t buy keys for RP, chests for RP, or anything related to this system for RP. If you don&#039;t, you should be ashamed of yourselves.","replies":[]}
