I know a lot of you are going to disagree with me and downvote me just by reading the title alone, but I want you to hear me out. Also note that I live in Canada, where the min. wage is higher than in the US, but our countries share the same problems, but your country suffers more than we do in this aspect.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m going to tackle some of the more common arguments against raising the minimum wage one by one, first one being the argument that &quot;well if a burger flipper at McDonald&#039;s earns $15/hour, the prices of food will just go up!&quot; That&#039;s just not true, because they won&#039;t need to go up. Think about this for a second: what&#039;s a guy making 8 bucks an hour going to buy? Is he going to put that money back into the economy? Is he going to take his family out for dinner? Is he gonna go buy furniture? Is he going to support the American automotive industry and buy a car? Is he going to buy anything other than the roof over his head, if he can even afford that? No. A minimum wage worker, right now, is not contributing to the economy and is not being a consumer. He&#039;s not consuming products that are made by middle-class, working people, he&#039;s not going out and creating other people&#039;s jobs, which ends up hurting the economy. A low minimum wage helps nobody but the top 1%. Nobody&#039;s worried about prices going up when corporate CEOs are making 300x what their workers make.\r\n\r\nAnother argument I hear is that people are worried their earnings won&#039;t go up. Yes they will. By raising minimum wage, you are raising the floor. By raising the floor, you&#039;re raising the earnings of everyone else on top of it. So of course your wage will go up as well, because companies won&#039;t want you to quit their job to go work at a Burger King for the same money. They still need workers. They still need you.\r\n\r\n&quot;But minimum wage was intended for part time kids going to school to earn a bit of pocket change.&quot; False. Just utterly false. Minimum wage was put in place to provide every worker in America the opportunity to live in decent comfort. That&#039;s what it was put in place for. It wasn&#039;t put in place for high school kids who were still living at home.\r\n\r\n&quot;Well they should just get a higher education to get a better paying job!&quot; Please. With college tuition as expensive as it is, how on earth do you expect them to be able to pay for it? That&#039;s another topic we could get into, but we&#039;ll save that for another day.\r\n\r\nI had one more point I wanted to make, but it&#039;s 3:30 in the morning and I forgot what it was :/ but yeah.. there&#039;s really no reason the wealthiest nation in the world should have a single digit (not counting past the decimal point) minimum wage. That&#039;s abhorrent.","replies":[]}
