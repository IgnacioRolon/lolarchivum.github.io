At least, not anymore (oh god the issues when Riot was still young.. consider yourself lucky if you weren't playing in Season 1). No, Riot's servers are actually quite good. I rarely have any issues, or if I do it's usually a fault on my end.\r\n\r\nWhat people *really* are complaining about is the location of said servers. Valid complaint, sure, but that doesn't mean the servers themselves are of poor quality. So don't say Riot's servers are shit just because you live in NYC and have 100 ping. That's purely a distance thing.\r\n\r\nJust clearing that up.\r\n\r\nOh, and East Coast scum or something. I broke character for a sec.. sorry guys.","replies":[]}
