I refused to sign it and am now talking with the union","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] General Discussion","up_votes":13,"down_votes":3,"body":"So she&#039;s been on my case for a while now and now she&#039;s finally decided to give me a written warning for something that she caused in the first place. I&#039;ve told her again and again that clopenings just don&#039;t work for me, but there she goes and schedules me for one once again, this time on Wednesday night/Thusday morning. Now, Thursday mornings are always a pain in the ass for me because I have to do my regular job, plus put away all the stock that comes in in the morning before I even get there. There were a couple problems that day, number one being that I was fucking dead tired because I didn&#039;t get much sleep because I worked late the night before. Number two was that the stock *fucking came late that day*. The truck didn&#039;t even show up until about 11:30, when the store&#039;s already been open for half an hour. I started at 9:30 because of the fact that we need extra time to put all the heavy shit away, but because it wasn&#039;t there yet, I obviously couldn&#039;t do it.\r\n\r\nSo when it finally *does* show up, I have my own regular job to do like cook chicken, marinade the spicy, and all the other things the morning cook has to do. I struggled to find time to put boxes away, but if I spent too much time on that then there&#039;d be a wait on product. Also remember I&#039;m still dead tired because of the night before and working on very little sleep. I think I only managed to get 2 hours of sleep due to the fact that, like a lot of people, I can&#039;t just fall asleep the minute I get home. I have to wind down first. Also, eating is important.\r\n\r\nNow, where the write up comes in is because of this: I forgot to mark down the date on some of the boxes that came in. That was the reason. What a stupid, petty reason to give a disciplinary warning.\r\n\r\nSo, I refused to sign it and emailed the union rep about it. If she wants to play ball, I&#039;ll fucking play ball. I ain&#039;t taking this bullshit sitting down.","replies":[]}
