Remember how people were pissed that Mewtwo was gone? Yeah, that&#039;s how I feel right now.\r\n\r\nI used to play Galio so much. I loved his look. I loved his design. His color scheme. His legendary skin, which I bought as soon as it came out.\r\n\r\nI&#039;ve just been Lucario&#039;d. And I&#039;m not happy about it.
