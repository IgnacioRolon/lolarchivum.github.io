It&#039;s like if you went to a hockey game and one dude on a team was wearing jeans and a tank top while everyone else was dressed properly.\r\n\r\nSo, why does Remi get to wear tank tops when the rest of the team wears their professional uniforms? I thought there was a dress code put in place to stop certain players (Dyrus did it I think?) from showing up in unprofessional attire, such as sweat pants and pajamas?","replies":[]}
