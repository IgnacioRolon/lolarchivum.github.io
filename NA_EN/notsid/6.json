Do mods even understand English?","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] General Discussion","up_votes":14,"down_votes":10,"body":"The band in question was called Ninja S*x Party. It was a link to a YouTube video of theirs, which I have linked before a couple times and never got so much as a warning about it. Now suddenly it&#039;s against the rules to post music videos? It's a fucking comedy band for fuck's sakes.\n\nWhat the fuck is this garbage? Yeah, NSP makes dick jokes and fapping jokes, BUT SO DOES TRYNDAMERE IN GAME. Are you fucking serious? I&#039;ve seen threads about the most vile of rap music and metal and shit stay up, or threads about weed go untouched, BUT NO, NINJA SEX PARTY IS BANNABLE!?\n\nThis has to be a fucking joke.\n\nUn fucking believable.\n\nHere's the thread:\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/WpfAi91.png\n\nAnd the ban message:\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/vrYPwqD.png\n\nI think my FEK is quite fitting for how I feel about the mod team here.","replies":[]}
