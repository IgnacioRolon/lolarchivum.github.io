They realized they fucked up, but won&#039;t say anything for fear of pissing off the hyper radical SJWs currently on their case. \r\n\r\n2. They don&#039;t think they did anything wrong, and that discrimination is ok, depending on who is on the receiving end. So no further statement is required.\r\n\r\nSo, Riot. When are you gonna hold a panel that says &quot;no whites allowed&quot;? I wanna go to a panel where I&#039;ll feel safe and no white people will be around to make me feel unsafe.\r\n\r\nShould be ok right? I mean, women apparently feel threatened by men 24/7, according to you. Same principle.\r\n\r\nI realize this thread may earn me a ban. Well, I&#039;m willing to take that risk to make a point. \r\n\r\nSo mods, if you feel you have to ban for this, I hold no ill will towards you. Just know that I&#039;m only doing what I feel is right, which is fighting discrimination.","replies":[]}
