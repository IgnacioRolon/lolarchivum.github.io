Sun and Moon are kinda disappointing because they&#039;re so much of a departure from the main series games. There&#039;s no gyms, no rival, no HMs, the game holds your hand the entire time and doesn&#039;t let you play without stopping you every 5 minutes to tell you how great you are and goes on and on about some crap nobody cares about. The Pok&eacute;mon games have never been story driven games. The story was only there to give you an excuse to fight things.\r\n\r\nEven the new season of the anime looks like garbage. It&#039;s like the animators don&#039;t give a shit anymore. \r\n\r\nIt&#039;s a shame because I actually liked the designs of the new pok&eacute;mon and most of the alola forms.. I mean, I&#039;m gonna keep playing and see if the game gets better, but so far I am not impressed by Moon.","replies":[]}
