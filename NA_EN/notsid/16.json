I&#039;m not saying gaming shouldn&#039;t be inclusive; I&#039;m saying **it always has been**.\r\n\r\nA lot of people, myself included, are drawn to gaming because real life sucked. Real life *wasn&#039;t* inclusive for me, growing up, so what could I do? Well, my cousin from across the country over in Ontario had just got a Super Nintendo, so they sent us their NES and all their games and stuff with it. I wasn&#039;t even old enough to go to school yet, and I was immediately drawn to the games. Mario was fun, the other random games I can&#039;t remember were fun. It was all just good fun. \r\n\r\nFast forward a few years and I&#039;m in school and kinda having a hard time fitting in. At the time, I was struggling with yet-to-be diagnosed ADHD, so it was really difficult for me to sit still and focus. I never made many friends; I was a small, scrawny little white boy who couldn&#039;t help being a little hyper and bouncy.\r\n\r\nI wasn&#039;t one of the &quot;cool&quot; kids, so I couldn&#039;t relate to them or hang out with them. I wasn&#039;t of aboriginal descent, so the native kids (I grew up in an area with a very large aboriginal population) just instantly disliked me. I blame bad parenting on the part of their parents for teaching them to hate, but I digress. So, I got bullied from multiple angles. \r\n\r\nI was bullied because I was a bouncy, often annoying kid. I was bullied because I was white. I was bullied because I was small and easily pushed around. I never wanted to fight. (No I didn&#039;t intend to make that rhyme) Even my teachers hated me. They said I was a disruption to everyone around me. They said I was making it difficult for others to do their work. I don&#039;t remember what I was doing, I don&#039;t remember why I was doing it, but I do remember not understanding why I felt so alone whenever I went to school.\r\n\r\nInstead of trying to find a way to get me to focus on my stuff, the school figured it would me best to just cut me out like a cancerous tumor and put me in a room, alone, with a textbook and whatever work sheet they had for me. Did I have anyone to help me if I got stuck on a problem? No. Did I have any adult supervision at all? No. Did I even have a window to look out of? No. It was essentially a storage closet that had a desk and a bed in it, which was used for kids who got sick at school and needed to lie down, and extra school supplies. \r\n\r\nThey even decided it wasn&#039;t even ok for me to go outside for lunch when the rest of the kids did. No, I had to wait until they were done and *then* I could go out for about 15 minutes, all by myself. No friends. No playground (I had to stay within eyesight of the principal in her cozy little office.) No fun. Just sit out by the trees and get fresh air.\r\n\r\nSo, what does this have to do with gaming? **Everything**. Gaming was all I had. Gaming was what I had to look forward to after a bullshit day. After our family got a dog, then she was part of my relief too. But games were always there when I need them. They offered an escape from the shitty existence that was the real world. I just thank the stars that my parents weren&#039;t assholes as well, or else I may have turned out really, really troubled or maybe worse.\r\n\r\nReal life wasn&#039;t inclusive. Video games were. Video games always said &quot;hey just pick up that controller and start &#039;er up! Pop in that cartridge, baby! Here we go! World 1 - 1! Let&#039;s-a go!&quot;\r\n\r\nHow, then, have we come to this era of people who demand that every single game be made exactly the way they want? How dare anyone come in and tell me that, because I&#039;m a gamer, I&#039;m &quot;problematic&quot; in society? No. Society pushed me out. Society turned its back on me and games were there to make life suck just a little bit less.\r\n\r\nI was smiling when I was playing games. I forgot about being stuck in a small room all day. I have very fond memories of bonding with my dad with several of those games. Those memories I&#039;ll treasure forever. \r\n\r\nIt&#039;s not enough to be victimized for being a nerdy gamer type guy, but now we&#039;re *villainized* too? No fucking way.\r\n\r\nGames have always been inclusive; they had to be in order to sell more of them to as many people as possible. It&#039;s real life that was far from inclusive. Games always said &quot;try again?&quot; Real life always said &quot;go fuck yourself&quot;.\r\n\r\nI don&#039;t know if this made any sense or if I was just rambling incoherently. If I was, my apologies. To anyone who stuck it out and read the whole thing, my hat goes off to you. You&#039;re the real MVP. This has been on my chest for as long as I can remember. \r\n\r\n*long exhale*","replies":[]}
