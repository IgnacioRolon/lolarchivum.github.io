Extra help was not given to women and NB people to attend an event. Men were outright restricted from attending, so neither equality nor equity was achieved here.\r\n\r\nTo go with this baseball analogy accurately, it would be like if security either escorted the guy on the left out of the stadium, or prevented him from even entering in the first place. The man on the left now no longer gets to watch the game at all, rather than everybody being able to.\r\n\r\nDo you really have to kick the guy on the left out so that the two on the right can watch the game? All 3 have paid tickets. All 3 should get to watch.","replies":[]}
