Nerfing the late game of an all melee champion is just stupid, and won&#039;t even fix the problem people are having in the first place, unless you just want people to stop picking him altogether.\n\nI&#039;m fully aware this isn&#039;t a major nerf, but they&#039;re still nerfing the wrong area, IMO.","replies":[]}
