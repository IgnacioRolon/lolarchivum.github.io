We were once the breadwinners of the household, but that role has been taken away from us. Not to say that that in itself is bad, but it does leave many males wondering about how they fit into society now that their main purpose appears to be gone.\n\nI recently came across this article and was floored at how accurate it is. It says everything that's been on my mind for a long time and addresses the confusion many men, like myself, are facing and why it's leading to a mass depression for males everywhere. This isn't an attack on anything, but more of a thing for men like me to read and maybe understand our issues a bit more.\n\nIt is a really long article, but if you are like me and are suffering from confusion and depression, reading this might help. Know that you are not alone, and it's ok to feel that way. A lot of us do.\n\nhttp://www.breitbart.com/Breitbart-London/2014/12/04/The-Sexodus-Part-1-The-Men-Giving-Up-On-Women-And-Checking-Out-Of-Society\n\nEdit: Welp, this thread sure blew up quickly. Just thought I'd make a few things clear:\n\nI don't want things going back to \"male dominance\" or whatever. That's not what this is about. What this IS about is the fact that treating women poorly in today's society is deemed wrong, which is obviously a good thing, but we still can't do the same for men yet. We treat a man wrong and we instinctively think \"well what did he do to deserve it?\". It's hard for us to see a man as a victim, or a woman as an abuser.\n\nWhat this thread IS about is spreading awareness to a growing problem, a serious problem that's going to get out of hand if we let it continue this way. What do we do about it? Hell if I know. This is a problem I can't even begin to know how to start fixing.","replies":[]}
