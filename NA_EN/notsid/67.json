It makes your taste buds think they&#039;re tasting something sweet like sugar, so it &quot;does the job&quot; that sugar would do. This is handy for people with diabetes, who can&#039;t consume sugar. But even so, in my expert opinion (I eat things, therefore I am an expert at how things taste. No backtalk) this stuff is rancid as FUCK.\r\n\r\nI accidentally bought some sugar-free Jell-o, right? The packages were right next to each other, I absent-mindedly grabbed the wrong one, dangit. Oh well, it&#039;s only $0.97. So I made it anyway and tried it. The first bit I had wasn&#039;t bad, but from the second spoonful onward I got this horrible aftertaste in the back of my throat, and still have it as I post this. The more Jell-o I had, the more I hated it. Like, this stuff tastes terrible, not to mention is terrible for your body. It&#039;s downright toxic.\r\n\r\nSo, health reasons aside, how do people enjoy the taste of Diet soft drinks and other products which contain aspartame? I know people who aren&#039;t diabetic or have other health reasons that would restrict them to Diet drinks yet still choose to drink Diet because they say it tastes better. This stuff actually gives me headaches it&#039;s that bad.","replies":[]}
