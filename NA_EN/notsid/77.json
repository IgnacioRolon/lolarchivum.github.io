I didn&#039;t actually fall, but holy crap.. I&#039;m almost in tears with how bad this hurts.\r\n\r\nI wasn&#039;t supposed to work today, but they called me in before to just cover for 4 hours, but I can&#039;t lift anything now. I can barely walk. I can&#039;t sit up straight. There&#039;s no one else that can come in to take my place.\r\n\r\nI managed to convince the in charge to let me go home at 6, rather than 8. So only 2 hours.. but this is the longest 2 hours I&#039;ve ever had to endure. \r\n\r\nBack pain is the worst, you guys. Take care of your back.","replies":[]}
