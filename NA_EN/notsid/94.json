For example, all Canadian chicken must not contain any growth hormones or any of that shit, but in the states I don&#039;t think that&#039;s the case. Even the cooking oil used by Canadian places is higher quality.\r\n\r\nSeriously, I went to LA once and all the food I had there sucked. Everything from a Wendy&#039;s Baconator (which literally made me vomit several times) to spaghetti and meatballs, to California&#039;s famous In-n-Out, to random grocery store food. Everything I ate there was terrible.\r\n\r\nWhat&#039;s the deal? How can Americans get so fat with food that tastes so awful?","replies":[]}
