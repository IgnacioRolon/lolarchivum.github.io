You want to meet someone of the opposite sex (or same sex, whatever, you  get my point) because, well, you&#039;re human, and kinda lonely. You want some human interaction that could lead to either a relationship, or just simply a night of fun.\n\nYou go to a bar and sit down and order your usual. And you sit there. And sit there. And sit there. Oh hey there&#039;s a cute girl. But you sit there. And sit there. Wouldn&#039;t it be cool to talk to her? She seems pretty nice. But, you just sit there. And sit there. \n\nYou see another guy go chat her up. Dang, wouldn&#039;t it be awesome if you could do that? But you can&#039;t. Something is holding you down. You&#039;re locked in place and can&#039;t move. Your mind is thinking. It&#039;s thinking about so many things at once; about what could go wrong, what you&#039;d do if it went wrong, how you&#039;d feel, what other people would think of you.\n\nSo, you stay put. You see all these other people go about this stuff like it&#039;s easy. It IS easy. But you still can&#039;t do it. Why? You don&#039;t even know. You know it&#039;s stupid. You know it&#039;s weird. Around friends, you&#039;re a clown. You&#039;re happy and relaxed and the life of the party. But here, in the bar? It&#039;s like you&#039;re a completely different person.\n\nIt&#039;s ok. You&#039;re used to being alone. You&#039;ve been alone for a long time. Such a long time that you don&#039;t know how to do anything else anymore. So you drink some more. Then you go home, still alone, like always.\n\nThat&#039;s just one example of what it&#039;s like. And it sucks, GD. It fucking sucks.\n\n#Venting","replies":[]}
