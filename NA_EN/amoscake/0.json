Happened 4 times now and the only solution was to restart my computer.  I even reinstalled the game which took age.  Got the leaving buster 4 times.  Absolutely no solution and very frustrated.

I want to first make sure your network is still properly setup using this [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues). Pay attention to the steps on port forwarding and how to flush your DNS, but let me know if that doesn't help much!","replies":[{"poster":"AmosCake","date":"2017-09-04T17:47:44.713+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey thanks for the reply. I followed the connection guide and went ahead and tried to play a blood moon game but it went black and became unresponsive again. I think my network is still properly set up because before it went black, i was able to play a game. After that game was when the screen stayed black after champ select.\n\nThank you","replies":[]}]}]}
