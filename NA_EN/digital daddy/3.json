I know &quot;Oh but it&#039;s free why are you complaining&quot; I&#039;m complaining cause, I earned those from playing good/I Bought those chests. My suggestion to make OE income more profitable would be to, Make them disenchant for more, or make it where you have to wait less to get another ready chest, or make skin shards cheaper. Cause when you get a reward you have to work for even though it says it&#039;s a reward is kinda dumb\r\n \r\nNow on to Blue Essence. It&#039;s way too slow, you level up but sometimes you get poor champions that go for 90 essence\r\nand it just is a real kick in the back to players that don&#039;t want to play every waking minute of the day just to grind levels for BE.\r\nI&#039;d say a guaranteed 3150 champion to disenchant for 630 BE, or have it where it gives you BE based on how many games you played to level up/ what they were, how long they were. Kinda like IP.\r\n\r\nIdk i guess i&#039;m kinda running my mouth with ideas that either don&#039;t make sense or have a lot of holes in it. Feel free to tell me your ideas and correct me in the comments.","replies":[{"poster":"Supreme Senpai69","date":"2018-04-29T01:07:20.662+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's really dumb that getting ride of a skin gives so little orange essence, but the skins cost so much.

The only difference between us seems to be that I have enough BE for my purposes though. OE... I consider them to be quite generous with it (and even little bit stupid financially) since they give us free skin shards (and even skins themselves) via loot system. Every free skin they give away is potentially less money for them to keep the company running. So in my opinion the pace they give the skins away is faster than I consider 'wise'.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Bisaknosp","date":"2018-04-29T16:31:02.650+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"skins i got for free:\n\ndeath sworn zed\nresistance caitlyn\ncreator viktor \nwarring kingdoms j4\nprogram lissandra\nprogram soraka\nstar guardian janna\ndemon blade tryndamere\ndawnbringer riven\ncorporate mundo\nnighthunter rengar\ndragonslayer xin\nchampionchip thresh\nstinger akali \njunkyard trundle\nhappy elf teemo\naviator irelia\ndynasty ahri\ndarkflame shyvana\npharao nidalee\ntotemic maokai\nsafecracker evelynn\nproject yi\n\nthese are the skins i got from the hextech loot system (not including ward skins and icons)\n\ncant complain tbh i got so much good stuff imo so i cant comprehend with ya folks\n\nand no i didnt buy chests with rp\nmaybe a few keys with leftover rp but nothing else","replies":[]},{"poster":"ToasterOpera","date":"2018-10-25T04:12:05.281+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am fine with the current state of BE, but earning an S rank and getting a super nice skin shard from it, only to not be able to get the skin, is heartrending. Even more so is when you keep getting good shards, so you don't want to disenchant any of them, so you never get any OE, so you stare teary eyed at the cool skins you won by being awesome, but which will always be slightly out of reach.
