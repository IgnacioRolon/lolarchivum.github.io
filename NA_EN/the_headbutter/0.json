She ults then gets caught by the nami bubble.   However watch the pathing.   It is the exact shortest pathing to avoid the bubble.   The only reason that it landed was the fact she was immobile while ulting.    The movement was also toward her enemys tower and team.   That is very unusual decision making other then that it is the shortest pathing to try to avoid the bubble.   \n\n\nWhile I am not sure that was scripting I believe it probably was.   \n\nAlso at 33 sec you can see two abilities cast with no delay.... while that can be done notice the change in centering to match with the pathing of LB making it a noticable change in targeting within a almost impossible margin of time.","replies":[]},{"poster":"WitchQueen Annie","date":"2018-03-22T05:01:11.176+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"It looks like {{champion:7}} was absolutely showered in thick venom... \n\nI wonder if there's some way to profit from this video.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cocho","date":"2018-03-22T04:21:29.220+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"In the start of the frist clip, look at how she clicked.
