For reference, Vlad's targeted heal can heal him for 20 / 25 / 30 / 35 / 40 (+ 35% AP).  At rank 9, Vlad can heal for about the same as Sylas does with Crimson Rush.  This doesn't take into account the fact that Sylas has his heal doubled when below 40% health which means he currently can get a 340 + 70%AP heal at rank 9 and at rank 1 it's 100 + 60%AP.  Of course you can't directly compare the two because Vlad is ranged, has an easier time procing it, etc.  However, considering Sylas' heal is also targeted with a hefty amount of damage as well as the fact that he doesn't really have all that much trouble getting to a target (especially in the early game) it is a pretty insane heal.\r\n\r\nHis heal can make him insanely hard to push out of lane because of how easy it is to proc and makes his all ins super crazy as well.  Doesn't really feel fun playing against someone who can win a trade or all in because he used his targeted heal.  I would consider lowering the base by a lot more and increasing the AP Ratio more to compensate.  Another option could be to make the threshold for the double heal a lot lower (20 - 30%).  He's already in a solid spot for a new champion so I'm kinda confused as to why he is even being buffed in the first place tbh.","replies":[{"poster":"Boatwhistle","date":"2019-02-24T08:01:17.032+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":6,"body":"A sylas maxing heal is a weak sylas if you have grievous wounds, he loses so much of the value he invests in from this.

Sylas doesn't have the burst potential a lot of other bruisers do, unless fed, nor does he have as accessible CC. His survivability in a teamfight is purely reliant on his ability to heal. Makes me wonder what we could do with Diana if we took away some of her burst in exchange for a heal on her Pull-in, maybe have some fun and make it heal more when she pulls in more people.","replies":[{"poster":"Akali is SO HOT","date":"2019-02-24T19:21:02.999+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The bigger problem is that there isn't really any good AP Bruiser items in the game so they have to give AP Bruisers really good defensive mechanics that can be unfun to play against and sometimes overpowered.  I would rather Sylas get his heal nerfed and compensated in some different way so he's not as frustrating to play against.  They could still give him the ability to do a lot of healing in teamfights and later stages of the game.  The only problem I'm really having atm is his early - early mid game healing.\n\nThis whole thing is really only part of a larger problem, but the smaller things can be given band aid fixes that sorta help the problem for the time being.","replies":[{"poster":"Academy Kayn","date":"2019-02-24T19:32:52.760+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Personally, I've had a worst time dealing with his CDs than his healing in the early game, but that's just me. That said, having a bruiser item implemented doesn't address the times in laning phase in which the healing might be a problem, and then we ask the question again, does he need that healing to get along fair in Lane? Normal bruisers have the ability to buy lifesteal, and while Sylas can go gunblade, it's not the best rush item when he desperately needs to bulk up. \n\nI think at this point it is firmly a design conflict, or at least an foreign place for us. Sylas is the first AP Melee bruiser that hasn't just felt like a Burst mage. Even when Fed, his design spreads out his damage so far that you're still given a fair chance. A familiar case with Riot releasing Melee champions, a constant debate on \"Do they need it and when do they.\"","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-02-24T09:33:39.987+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Academy Kayn,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=7t23KEdW,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2019-02-24T09:20:08.689+0000)\n>\n> I mean, in fairness, Vlad also get's his natural HP growth with AP along with his sustain, along with his Ult's HP gain, along with intargetibility with his pool.
