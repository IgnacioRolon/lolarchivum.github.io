Second, if you think Boards are nothing but complaints, you must be putting a lot of effort into avoiding the avalanche of posts about Worlds and the Popstar 2.0 skin line. That's why the first group of people is complaining, by the way: bugs and balance issues abound, but the second group of people doesn't care about that and just eats up competitive play, music videos, and so on.\n\nHave you noticed that \"balance is garbo but I love the game's Story, Art, &amp; Sound\" has gotten a lot of traction in the last few months? Riot is focusing on the things that make them money: skins and pro play. Riot doesn't sell bug and balance fixes for RP (in fact, they do the opposite - new champs and skins generally get buffs for a while), so it's tough to justify spending resources on that. Unfortunately, this logic isn't sustainable in the long term, as even the most vapid \"CAN K/DA GET MOAR FX PLZ?\" players will get annoyed by the game's actual gameplay and possibly quit, while the players who are here to actually play would only buy the occasional skin when they're having fun with the game. Given the \"To Sell Toys\" nature of LoL (also known as \"merchandising\"), a solid base product is core to the business model. People are quitting, and thigh-high skins aren't keeping them here no matter how much the cosmetics crowd loves them.\n\nIf you've heard of Rift, you'll be familiar with what happens when gameplay is abandoned in favor of things that actually show up on the quarterly balance sheet.

Second, if you think Boards are nothing but complaints, you must be putting a lot of effort into avoiding the avalanche of posts about Worlds and the Popstar 2.0 skin line. That&#x27;s why the first group of people is complaining, by the way: bugs and balance issues abound, but the second group of people doesn&#x27;t care about that and just eats up competitive play, music videos, and so on.\n> \n> Have you noticed that &quot;balance is garbo but I love the game&#x27;s Story, Art, &amp; Sound&quot; has gotten a lot of traction in the last few months? Riot is focusing on the things that make them money: skins and pro play. Riot doesn&#x27;t sell bug and balance fixes for RP (in fact, they do the opposite - new champs and skins generally get buffs for a while), so it&#x27;s tough to justify spending resources on that. Unfortunately, this logic isn&#x27;t sustainable in the long term, as even the most vapid &quot;CAN K/DA GET MOAR FX PLZ?&quot; players will get annoyed by the game&#x27;s actual gameplay and possibly quit, while the players who are here to actually play would only buy the occasional skin when they&#x27;re having fun with the game.
