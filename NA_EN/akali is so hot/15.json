All day everyday she is complaining about something and ranting about how I play video games too much even though I spend most of my day at a full time job and then tutor my brothers when I get home.  This last weekend my dad, brothers, and I painted the whole back yard and she was still bitching at us.  I don&#039;t know what she wants from me.  I do everything right, but she&#039;s never fucking happy.  Jesus Christ.  Someone save me please.\r\n\r\nEnd rant.","replies":[]}
