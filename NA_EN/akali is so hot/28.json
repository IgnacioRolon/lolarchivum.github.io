Adding a stack resets the debuff timer.  Note that 1 shadow stack proc does less damage than the proc of a current Q but the damage stacks up rapidly per stack.\n\n**Twilight Shroud:**\n-Gets resists back\n\n**Crescent Slash:**\n-Energy cost reduced\n-Reduces the debuff timer by 75% of the current time left\n-Damage slightly increased.\n\n**Shadow Dance::**\n-Range reverted back to 800\n-Damage slightly reduced\n\n**Overview:**\n-Gives Akali more counterplay because she can&#039;t instantly kill you by pressing QR and auto attack.  Since she isn&#039;t doing damage with the initial Q proc she won&#039;t be able to become a mega sustain tank if she gets ahead (she&#039;ll still get the sustain just not be able to do it consistently but rather in large bursts).\n-E is actually useful now to some extent.  It can allow Akali to kill her target with the procs more quickly if she thinks she has enough procs to kill them with it instead of having to wait for the debuff to expire and risk the target being able to heal up or being saved by the support.  Note that as said earleir 1 stack does less damage than a current Q proc so she can&#039;t Q,AA,E for tons of instant damage\n-Because it&#039;s harder for her to assassinate you she gets her resists on shroud back as well as her old ult range back to help her get more Q stacks.\n-Makes it so she doesn&#039;t wiff her auto attacks every other time\n\nThoughts?","replies":[]}
