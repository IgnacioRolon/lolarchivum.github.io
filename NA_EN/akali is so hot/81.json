Over the years i have never seen such a huge change to so many champions rolled out at once including changes to map, items and game play.  Change is always good when it's aimed to improve game-play. However these changes where made just based on how it made player FEEL!  Perhaps some people complained about how it didnt feel good to get assassinated so you decided to change a bunch of champions to help with that feeling!  BUT, you can ALWAYS assassinate people, with almost any champ!! Its called BUILD!  So i'm really not sure what Riot was going for.  I've lost games this week to a feed Jhin who 1 shot people and a feed Diana who 1 combo killed tanks and it because they were feed, and built correctly, and played the champ well.  You cant punish players for choosing to play a set of champions that feels rewarding to them and has been a part of the game since the start.  Look at the original champ from season one, any of the AP champs could kill you in 1 combo and few items.  Which is another thing i've noticed in item changes, removing dmg from items and adding actives with CD so you can only use the full items dmg in one go before its on CD and you have to wait.  \n\nI'll end with this, Riot if you want to cater to the young players with these change you will lose seasoned players who have been with you since the bigining and helped make this game what it is.  Today after all these years of playing league I uninstalled the client and wont play until I see what changes happen next season.  \n\nThe end.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Irelia Bot","date":"2016-11-10T06:08:34.121+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I want to give it a chance but they have already made things so bad for akali and made ranged get even more powerful early game poke...","replies":[{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2016-11-10T07:18:24.789+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Her good matchups are now ok and her bad matchups are now unplayable.
