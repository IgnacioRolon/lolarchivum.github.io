{"poster":"Akali is SO HOT","date":"2019-02-17T02:49:19.048+0000","title":"The Akali Update has turned out to be a Disappointing Downgrade","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":19,"down_votes":9,"body":"Before the rework, old Akali had a low pickrate and a low banrate with a good winrate.  Most people didn't really like her that much, but she wasn't widely hated by the players.  The rework was supposed to modernize her kit and make her better for modern League.  Now she's back to a low pickrate and low banrate, but now she has a garbage winrate and everyone hates her.  As long as she has her current kit she'll stay this way because if she is at all decent in soloq she'll be busted in pro play.  The whole design of her kit just isn't good and is what keeps her in this awful state.\n\nA big reason she is this way is because they decided to make her kit entirely revolve around her shroud.  It turns out that this isn't a good idea and in order to make a champion that functions around a single ability good you have to make that ability completely busted.  This could potentially end up working out in theory, but when you make the ability incredibly unfun to play against and insanely good it just doesn't.  It should've been very apparent from the beginning that obscurity under turrets was a bad idea.  There weren't any Akali players that I knew that supported the idea of her being immune to turrets with her shroud.  You would think that even when she was still 100% p/b in pro after the first couple rounds of nerfs that they would've decided to remove it, but they just kept other pointless ones coming.  It also turns out that when you make the one ability the champion is balanced around super bad, then the champion will also be super bad.\n\nAnother bad thing about her kit is the fact that she has an execute on her ultimate.  This is also another reason why she was p/b in pro since release.  She can go into a fight and even if she can't kill her target she can still use R2 to kill whichever enemy her team got down low.  It's the same reason Urgot is currently high priority.  They changed her ult from something that she could use to stick to her target to a big damage boom stick that she uses to instakill whoever is low on the enemy team.  It also doesn't help that it isn't targeted anymore so if she's in trouble, then she has two free range dashes to get away with.\n\nThe third problem with her kit is how she goes about killing her target.  At this point she is really just a bad and squishy bruiser pretending to be an Assassin.  The only part of her kit that screams assassination is the execute on her ultimate which is, again, broken.  Unless she is far ahead, she has no burst in her kit that she can use to kill carries with.  Having to go into melee range to proc her passive and then **run away from the person she's trying to kill** and then trying to run back in to auto attack them is bad.  Dancing around like a headless chicken trying to get passive procs off isn't a well designed assassination pattern.  This all goes back to her shroud as well.  Due to the fact that her burst pattern is so slow, she needs her shroud to be able to survive long enough to use R2.  She just absolutely cannot fight without shroud in almost every situation.  Having such a busted ability be her whole crutch for actually killing people is so bad.\n\nThematically, it would make sense to focus on her shroud as it is a unique ability that no other champion has.  Gameplay wise this is an awful idea.  Long time Akali players didn't love playing Akali because of her shroud.  They enjoyed her because of how mobile and sticky she was with her ultimate.  For gameplay, she could function perfectly fine without her shroud.  Back when pinks revealed her and oracles was in the game she was still doing just fine.  It should've been painfully obvious to focus on her ult and dashes for the rework.  You could've made her shroud look and feel super amazing without turning it into the crutch she relies on to function as a champion.  Instead of focusing on her constantly being able to dash around all of the attention was focused on a gimmicky and broken ability and she was given a 2 dash ultimate on a long ass cooldown with one of the dashes being completely busted.  Her ult even has one of the highest cooldowns of all of the Assassin ultimates in the game which is even worse because she probably relies on her ult the most to kill her targets.\n\nHer whole kit is just bad design.  It has no redeemable features in it aside from her shroud which is a flawed ability.  She's just a poorly designed bruiser trying to be an Assassin, but failing at it.  Having a whole kit based around a badly designed ability and requiring high a cooldown ultimate to kill people is just bad design.\n\nThis isn't even to mention that she is almost nothing like old Akali.  The only thing that she had in her kit left that resembled Old Akali was her heal and now that's gone too.  Her new personality is just complete ass and super lame.  If I wanted to play an edgelord champion I would play Kayn or Zed and not Akali.  The voice lines they wrote for her are all just bad and lazy and are super generic.  Riot has always said that they keep long time Akali players in mind when making changes to her, but they've just lied over and over again and now we're here.  A champion with a lame personality and a poorly designed kit with a busted crutch of an ability.\n\nIt's very frustrating that they kept her in that state for so long and let her be p/b in pro for so many months.  It feels to me like they hyped her up with the KDA skin and now that they've cashed out on it they smashed her into the ground because they don't need her anymore.  I have little faith that the future changes they have planned for her will really fix anything and she'll just be like this forever.\n\nIt's pretty hard to sympathize with players who are unhappy with their champion rework until it happens to you.  I hope other players who love their champion don't end up like this when it's their turn for a rework.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/SjAPlYU.jpg[/img]","replies":[{"poster":"bluefire mark 2","date":"2019-02-17T05:02:51.525+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"RIP Aatrox.

Theres a reason she went top, and the reason she saw limited success in worlds was explicitly because of that ultra all in mindset. People, simply, _would not walk away_. \n\nI can list her counterplay for you, if you want? \n1) Shes melee. \n2) She requires multiple procs of her passive.\n3) She has high energy costs. \n4) Her major mobility is on an easy to dodge skillshot. \n5) Her W does not offer protection or utility. \n6) Shes predictable. \n7) Her ultimate is mediocre and serves solely to secure kills. \n8) Shes a bleeding diver without instant burst. \n\nThe _only_ reasons why the community has been _so negative_ towards Akali is because she went from a targeted damage champion to a skillshot reliant one, and because shes a CT champion. \nPeople equate their hatred of _old Akali_ to new Akali, and its compounded _by their hatred of CT_. We see the same thing with malzahar but without the CT bias; previous hatred stops the champion from receiving the changes they need to succeed.","replies":[{"poster":"Ereldra","date":"2019-02-17T14:15:15.992+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Just 2 things:\n1.)

While I was originally hopeful, giving her to CertainlyT was a bad call.

I don't completely blame him, as I think it's clear riot's modern designs are terrible at least from a balance standpoint.  Both her and Irelia's rework are pretty clear examples of riot not knowing what they are doing anymore and making champs the balance team can't deal with.  \n\n>A big reason she is this way is because they decided to make her kit entirely revolve around her shroud.\n\nAs a melee assassin, she needs a way to get to her target.

Boards certainly loves the bandwagon. \n\nFact of the matter is, CT does good work. His champions are kept strong numerically by the _BALANCE_ team. \nJust... Think for a moment. \nA car designer working for a city car manufacturer creates a car with 21 new features. \nManagement looks at the design, says okay, and pushes it through.... \n\nIf the design is overloaded with superfluous or to many features, do you blame the designer or management who let it go through? \nYou blame management. Not the designer. You do not put the cart before the horse, no matter how pretty the cart is.  \n\nYou need to hold accountable the people who should be held accountable. If a design is overloaded, once it gets in the hands of the balance team its _THEIR JOB and THEIR RESPONSIBILITY_ to say yes or no as to whether or not it gets implemented in that state. \nHeck, CT's champions arent even broken so much as can be frustrating.

Lets talk Cass, Irelia, Vayne and Ezreal.\n\nThis is coming back to our previous debate a few days ago where you said\n\n>     Paroe (NA) - 4 days ago\n> \n>     1) CT is a champion designer.\n>     2) Balance is supposed to work with designers.\n>     3) Balance is supposed to be the 'check' that a design goes through; once a champion reaches the final stages where they get real numbers applied, balance is the team that says \"yeah this is cool'.\n> \n>     4) This blind hatred for CT is pathetic. You people need to cool your jets and start trying to hold your yakuza style accountability to the people who actually are responsible for not balancing the game in a long-term way and allow flashy champions like CT's to be in the state they are\n> \n>     Do you blame the manager who let a lady walk out with more than she paid for, or do you blame the cashier who scanned the items?\n\nAnd I replied with\n\n> I am SICK and TIRED of this drivel where people selectively dissociate a champion designer from the balance of the champion. You say \"yeah but balance says yes\", but you conveniently forgot such objectively stupid idea has to be brought up to the balance team in the first place.\n> \n> A designer is at least partially responsible for the champion's balance state. Much like how editors are only there to make what comes out of the writer BETTER, a balance team is there to keep champions in line and not there to make the fucking champion for the designer who couldn't. No editor should be responsible to write the god damn story for the writer, similarly champion designs from the designer should already stand on their own prior to balance team working on it. CertainlyT hasn't been able to achieve any design that's remotely balanceable let alone balanced, with the only exception being Warwick, a rework he was credited for but in actually was only an associate of the project. And with so many of creations down the line each getting more and more extreme to the point of Zoe who is an utter antithesis to any design of a multiplayer game, it's clear that CertainlyT not only doesn't care but they act intentionally to break the game with each release, BECAUSE HE KNOWS HE CAN GET AWAY WITH IT AND GET PRAISED FOR IT. CertainlyT is not only a garbage designer, he may also as well be downright malicious.\n> \n> Now, concerning the \"well balance team said it's cool\": This is not to give balance team some credit, but even I am going to bet that the balance team isn't so stupid they weren't able to see utter design failures like Zoe as it is, or fail to catch Akali's semi invulnerability being a big red flag which anyone could see lightyears away. They still make out of the door not because of the balance team, but because of CertainlyT. CT must have a lot of political power within Riot since he's able to literally break everything, and has been doing it for years by being immune to criticism, immune to consequences of stealing other existing designs in the same game for YEARS, immune to the consequences of releasing only champions impossible to balance with the sole exception being one he is the least involved in (remember that ultimately, designing IS his job, and there IS A CONSEQUENCES for designers whose designs are consistently problematic and faulty); it's clear either Riot can't touch or simply intentionally let CT reign because his utter narcissistic garbo designs appeal to other garbo narcissists that populate the majority of the playerbase in an industry that sells power fantasy and promotion of self-glorifying cynicism and narcissism. With someone like that, how the fuck is the balance team even supposed to do with their creation? You tell me.\n> \n> Well, you don't need to because I already know. The balance team just says \"Yes\" to everything flown out of CT and then attempt to fix it later. Why do you think CT's champs are almost all reworked or going to be reworked despite their young age and that it also includes designs that are already reworks themselves?\n\nThis replied was unanswered by you (or maybe you replied and I forgot), and the thread was deleted by mod at some point (though I still have the page open and my tendency to not close my computer and browser has paid off, I guess).

Shes still bonkers. Once new Conq. goes live shes going to be even worse.  \n\nYour argument that things shouldnt even be brought up or shouldnt even need to told to be toned down highlights an intrinsic difference in the way you think versus the way i think. \nCreativity is about challenging the boundaries of what currently exists to create at least fresh takes on old concepts. You want to draw about the lines, not inside it.\nThe way you think is creativity inside a box. \"how do i do something fresh with existing pieces\".\nBoth have a place, but its the job of management in both cases to reign in or curtail ideas that could be problematic. Sometimes the puzzle pieces fit together way to well, as we see in Sylas.\nOther times the box was simply left to far behind, as we saw with Thresh and Zoe. \n\nIn the end, it still boils down to the various balance teams _letting_ things happen and _keeping_ things strong. Regardless of design... Riot loves their limelight balancing.\n\n_______________________________________\n\nOkay okay, heres another similar situation; \nA programmer works for the US border patrol. They write a drone program that allows dozens of small drones to work together to stitch a real-time view of dangerous areas. They add, in addition, a people recognition to the program that alerts border patrol, local police, immigration officers, AND the state guard if the drones spot people in their operation area.\n\nIt is, one hundred and one percent, up to their management to tell them \"Hey we dont need these to alert the local police, immigration, and the military\", and if the program were to ship WITH those additional things it would be managements fault entirely for _letting it ship with so many unneeded elements_.\n(Although knowing the US it will ultimately be the programmers fault and they would get sued or imprisoned....)","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2019-02-17T14:12:41.467+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"You entire argument hinges on the ASSUMPTION that balance team is the management and the last say of the champion design process.\n\nThe reality is that we do not know. And judging by the last few releases and re-releases I highly doubt if any had gone through any form of serious balancing before coming out. But still, that would also be an assumption on my part.\n\nAnd similarly, I can equally apply my imagination and my prowess at speculation and go back to my previous hypothesis, which you've completely ignored so far, that CertainlyT must have a lot of political power within Riot enabled by both the community and Riot themselves, to be able to do constant fallout and still somehow be in the company. Ffs, Ghostcrawler is gone from game designing at Riot and shoved into narrative design for both pulling less shit and being in the company for shorter than CertainlyT ; that's all you need to know how much power CertainlyT has within the company. And someone with this level of power can easily disrupt the company process to shape it around themselves and create double rules and double standards; this means it is plausible that CertainlyT could very much just skip the standard management process if he wants to, I mean he must have been doing it for years given his career. Welcome to company politics.\n\nSee? My theory works equally too. In fact if I were to brag, I'd say this is more likely what's actually happening in Riot.\n\n> Creativity is about challenging the boundaries\n\nYou can challenge the boundaries all you want if you are the only one going up against the odds; or at least you're jumping in suicide squad style with a bunch of like minded friends who want a piece of it. However, there is 0 reason to take the most popular game down with your experimentation.\n\nAnd challenging the boundaries implies you actually learns something out of it. CertainlyT has learned absolutely nothing out of their endeavour besides that they can hide behind pretty excuses and get away with exponential level of bullshit. That's how we even arrived at Zoe, the utter antithesis of both Riot and any multiplayer game's design 101.\n\nThere is a difference between pushing the boundaries and slowing turning on the temperature to boil and damn frog.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"VolatileAkali","date":"2019-02-17T14:05:22.546+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"CertainlyT and riot august are the one at fault, they ruined a beloved character because of \"unique\" and \"balanced\".

I'm sure OP explained exactly why her current kit is a big problem. We don't even need to debate on this because OP covered all of the corners already.\n\nAnd no, she was THE most banned champion in the Worlds because she was the one that lacked the most counterplay, deemed to even surpass someone like Urgot whose sole reason to even be picked in tournaments is to autowin lane. And as said, Akali was only starting to be banned well into the Worlds (a quarter) and from that point on she was banned supremely up to the mid-point, and then from that point she never showed up ever again because she was 100% banned; that is as a clear of an indicator of \"everyone realise how OP Akali is\" as you can ever get. That's how the bans work. That's the fact.\n\nAlso no, the reason you don't hear that much about Akali after Worlds (outside of the bit where you refuse to hear) is because she has been on the gutting train after Worlds; indeed, her first special delivery came about just 4 days after the end of 2018 Worlds and the rest is history.
