The first dragon is nice, dragons 2-4 are irrelevant, and dragon #5 is the only reason to even be killing dragons after the first buff - but games very very rarely reach that point.\n\nWhy is this a problem? If the objective is worthless, it makes for less interesting games. Dragon is almost never contested in professional play, it's simply not worth fighting over, which means a lot of time is just spent in lane AFK pushing while waiting for an objective that actually matters to appear on the map (Baron).

Rift Herald is also similarly useless, and they just trade low value objective for low value objective.\n\nDragons 2-4 don't really help with split pushing as much as you think. Dragon 2 only saves you a couple of AAs on a tower, which is fine but not going to compel people to take an objective. Dragon 4 is completely useless, a single spell rotation from any splitpushing or waveclearing champion that late in the game is going to kill minions with or without 15% extra.

In general, none of the buffs help non-damage oriented champions (except dragons 3 and 5, and only a little for the MS). \n\nSo buff 4 is a huge waste. The only reason to get dragon 4 was to threaten for dragon 5. Games often don't last that long though, so instead of taking dragon 4 you're better off taking a turret and ending the game before dragon 5 spawns. \n\nThe change to dragon 4 makes real sense. 30% damage reduction is too much, but 15% sounds good. I don't think it should triple on dragon 5, perhaps only double (I'm sure they can pull that off). Damage reduction from turrets is useful late game as good waveclear teams can just stall under turret.
