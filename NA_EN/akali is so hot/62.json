There are 4 things that I love about Akali and these are what they are.\n\n**1) Having to proc Mark of the Assassin**\nThis makes the ability much more interesting than just a missile that you throw at your target for some damage.  Having it be like Annie&#039;s Q or Kayle&#039;s Q would just be boring because nothing goes on with the abilities outside of a lame stun or slow.  Having to actually get up and close to your enemies to do something makes it both more challenging and interesting to play with which makes the gameplay much less static and more fun.  She doesn&#039;t get damage off on her opponents for free like Annie or Kayle do with their Qs which is much less frustrating to play against and makes it so you can&#039;t just sit back and spam Q all day with nothing going on.  If you want to do that play a different champion.\n\n**2) Twilight Shroud&#039;s Stealth**\nThis might be controversial because of all the stealth hate going on right now but whatever.  Twilight shroud has been one of the best things about playing Akali and I would be sad to see it go and be turned into a Graves smokescreen or whatever people are asking for.  Having it be countered by pinks and reveals makes it fair to play against unlike other champs like Twitch, Rengar, Eve, etc. because you know exactly where Akali is when she is stealthed and can take advantage of that.  At the same time, if the Akali player is smart, even if you have a reveal she can still take advantage of the movement speed it provides.  Being able to juke around your enemies is also really fun to do because of all the spots you can place it to give you multiple places to run to.  For example, something like this:\nAt 2:57\nhttps://youtu.be/rrxUO_UpdmY?t=177\n\nI also enjoy the idea of &quot;Oh shit Akali is in her shroud better not fight her here&quot; concept because it gives Akali more interesting ways of using Twilight Shroud&#039;s stealth to scare away her enemies or use it to position properly for an all in.\n\n**3) Shadow Dance's 3 Charges and Resets**\nTo be quite frank, if Akali didn&#039;t have this part of her kit she would be complete garbage.  Being able to stick to your targets when they try to escape feels really good and enforces Akali&#039;s strength in being one of the best pick assassins in the game.  If she only had 1 ult charge then that would mean all of her damage would have to be through the roof in her Q and Ult which would just lead to 100-0 gameplay with just 1 combo.  Giving her 3 charges means that you can make her combo weaker in exchange for allowing her to do them more often than other Assassins.  Akali is known for being on the weaker burst side of the spectrum of Assassins and having multiple ult charges is why.  I like the reseting part of her ult because it still gives her something to do when she&#039;s killed her target.  Katarina can still bounce around all over the place after she&#039;s killed her target, leblanc can dash all over the place with her low cooldown W and still help the team with chain CC, Khazix has the slows on his W and the resets on his E for more jumping around, etc.  The reset aspect of Akali&#039;s ult is what allows her to still be useful to the team after she&#039;s finished off a carry instead of just sitting there doing basically nothing.\n\n**4) Spellvamp**\nAkali has no reliable defensive mechanism because her shroud is so easily countered with pinks and reveals and this is her way of staying alive in teamfights.  What I really like about this is that she doesn&#039;t get to press a button and get out scott free like other Assassins do, but in order to survive she is forced to fight.  If she doesn&#039;t fight then she doesn&#039;t get healed from her spellvamp and if she doesn&#039;t get healed from her spellvamp then she doesn&#039;t survive.  So this way she has to work to survive instead of just pressing a button and saying bye like Zed, Khazix, Leblanc, etc. can.  This can cause the problems of being a drain tank which can be really cancer to deal with and stuff but I&#039;m sure Riot will either completely remove this from her or change it drastically.  I would just like it to be a part of her kit in some way or form instead of giving her a get out of jail free card because that would just emphasize hit and run fighting which isn&#039;t as fun as staying in the fray and fighting till the end.\n\nAlso, don&#039;t change the name of her Passive because that would just be sad.  This is an Akali thread so downvote away or whatever.  Thanks for reading.","replies":[{"poster":"Sammystorm","date":"2016-07-04T23:31:56.120+0000","up_votes":20,"down_votes":3,"body":"The main thing I disagree with is spell vamp.

Anyways Akali isn't a very great team fighter. Most assassins aren't. Her biggest weakness is getting cc'ed before she can kill something. That doesn't make it ok for her to have a huge amount of sustain though.

So even if she has to get in range every time she is thrown away by displacements, stuns, etc her job is to distract the enemy team and make them use skills on her.\nWhich is actually quite balanced (she doesn't mass carry when ahead, nor be totally worthless when behind) and can still be counterplayed by how you play vs her.\n\nYou might say I'm biased. But there were plenty of times when the enemy team was able to kite me down and peal for their carry.

While it is fun, and in fact absolutely necessary for Akali to function with her current kit, she probably needs a rework to not be dependent on this mechanic. Similarly, the Spellvamp probably requires a rework as well, one that is not stat based but perhaps combo-oriented. \n\nTo be frank, Akali's kit needs a large-scale rework. Crescent Slash is underpar right now, while Shadow Dance is a very powerful ult that construct the basis of Akali's kit and playstyle. And Shadow Dance may not be the most healthy mechanism for an assassin.

The ability to do hybrid damage and waveclear as early as level 5 (Rank 3 E with 2 long swords kills the entire wave with an auto to everything) make her no complete garbage and it is a much more reliable ability than Q which is a glorified 1 point wonder since they changed the energy refund. It is also the main reason bruiser Akali works since it scales well with AD and is spammable for how much damage it actually does (like a 240 base on a 0.8 second CD with a Total AD scaling).\n\nDoes it gel well with the rest of the kit? Arguably no, but it is one of her best abilities and she SHOULD keep the ability to do hybrid damage when they rework her since that is currently one of her best traits since only her and Corki are able to pull 50-50 damage splits fairly consistently (if you go bruiser akali you more often than not do a very close 50-50). The Q can honestly go since it is clunky in its current iteration and I would honestly like to see the playstyle of Bruiser Akali transition over to the rework than Glass Cannon Akali that just QR Autos you for most of your health. By taking the playstyle of Bruiser Akali that is more sustain damage based and AoE with mobility she would be the only AoE Assassin besides Talon and to some extent Katarina which would set her apart from the rest and it would arguably be healthier than the nightmare that was Akali during her prime where there was very little counterplay since she straight up 1 shot you with Q and R after Gunblade.\n\nEdit: By the playstyle of Bruiser Akali I do mean the actual playstyle and not the build itself since I do think she should be building damage and not tank items.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"YCitizenSnipsY","date":"2016-07-05T00:28:00.274+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think the stealth is that big of a deal.

If Akali has all 3 charges, Ahri cannot get away since Akali and chase dash for dash, flash for flash. Akali doesn't have to escape. She can just turn and try to kill her assailant and hope she bursts them down and heals through their finishing damage.\n\nAkali is in a bad spot, because she's one of 'those' champions. Ones who are intentionally left weak due to their playstyle.\n\nHell, I have an easier time against Leblanc than I do Akali.\n\nThis is all coming from an Ahri OTP basically.","replies":[{"poster":"Serika Zero","date":"2016-07-05T13:11:26.168+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Akali has 1 charge at lv6. It charges up in the next seconds 30s for one charge. That's 1 minute. Akali needs 1 minute to have all 3 charges after hitting lv 6 (unless she died with-in that time).\n\nNext, Ahri has 3 dashes. Akali ends up having 3 dashes.\nAkali is melee, so she needs to dash once to get in range. Then Ahri can dash away. Then Akali dashes once more -> Ahri dashes away -> Akali uses her final dash -> Ahri dashes away again.\n\nIts simple numbers, Ahri can escape Akali fairy easily. Ofc, if you build pure offense on Ahri, you will feel the pain 1 minute after lv6. While I agree that GunBlade is strong, so is {{item:3001}} and its cheaper ;) combine that with the farm advantage you should have from lane (not even kills). You should have {{item:3001}} {{item:1056}} {{item:1056}} (total gold 3550) by the time Akali gets {{item:3146}} (3400 gold).\n\nThen you can build further into CDR and mana or whatever you want.\nAkali HAS to get ahead or she is in a shitty spot if she builds AP. While the tank build is more forgiving.\n\nSo, lets go over it again shall we, regarding AP Akali:\nShe has no escapes in lane.\nShe has no wave clear.\nShe has no pick potential.\nShe has no peal potential.\nShe has to snowball to win games.\nShe has one of the weakest laning phases ever.\nShe has no zoning tools, unless she is ahead. Then she can zone with her Q and pose aggressively.\nShe is point and click.\nShe is melee.\nShe has sustain.\nShe can stick to her target for extended period of time.\nShe can assassinate people with ease when at equal or ahead. But due to shitty laning phase she will start behind and that's why she has to get ahead.\nLike every other multiple spells ap assassins (note: not fizz) {{item:3211}} is a massive item against her.\nShe uses energy, and together with her sustain, it allows her to win attrition wars vs other melees.\n\nShe has tradeoffs. Akali has been seen as a bad assassin ever since the E can no longer proc Q nerf. And that would have only given her some zoning tools and average laning phase.\n\nAhri has:\nWave clear.\nPeal potential.\nKite potential.\nEscapes, albeit she sacrifices her kill pressure if she uses her ultimate defensively.\nOutplay potential. Since her ultimate requires no target.\nDoesn't require to snowball for win.\nAverage laning phase (not the best, nor the worst).\nSkill shot based - requires good aiming, so bad players gona suck at her\nZoning tool, just like Akali, only available when she is ahead and is able to posture aggressively in lane.\nRanged = easy farming\nMinimal sustain in lane, might as well have not had a passive tbh >.>\nCan chase a target very well (stickyness)\nCan assassinate people when at equal or ahead if they don't build resistances.\nHas mana.\n\nIf anything Ahri is ahead of Akali in terms of pros and cons. The one big thing Akali has over Ahri is: easier to play.\n\nTbh, LeBlank is a VERY DIFFICULT champion to play at average or good levels (easy to play at 'bad' level). I highly doubt you faced good LeBlanc players in silver often enough to leave mental scars.

She has been intentionally dumpstered for a while by Riot. Still doesn't mean she's fun to play against.

The ideal combo is Q, wait, R, AA, Q AA, three times, over a minimum of 12 seconds (no CD). If the ADC/team is good, you're not going to be able to get an initial Q off. If you have to use 2 R's to get to them, your damage is severely reduced from there. One incomplete rotation isn't enough to kill someone unless they're severely behind or went full glass canon (though a lot of ADC like to build some MR now).

Late game it is too easily countered.  Akali drops a shroud?  Your support or anyone else can drop a pink ward, 100% negating the shroud for the teamfight.  \n\nOther stealth champions are not so severely countered by pinks.  Shaco,  for example, can play around a pink if he knows where it is.  The pink can effectively zone him, and can keep him from getting to juicy targets in a teamfight, but it does not completely erase his q.  \n\nBut with Akali, your shroud is  a big \"place pink ward here\" sign.  \n\nI know you don't want Akali's kit to be changed.  But Akali is currently balanced around the fact that her shroud  is worthless late game (and her e is also pretty worthless since it cannot proc  q's and it is basically an energy hole in teamfights).  This means that Akali has to be given tons of damage on q and r, tons of mobility, and tons of spellvamp for her to be viable.  \n\nShroud needs to provide an advantage late game if the rest of her kit is going to be fixed.  However, you can't just make shroud immune to vision wards because this would make the shroud uncounterable.  \n\nSo the shroud needs to provide more conditional invisibility.  What needs to happen is that she is invisible to enemies outside the shroud when she is inside it and she is invisible to enemies inside the shroud when she is outside it.  You could make it so enemies must be inside the shroud for at least .25 or .5 seconds to gain vision of her, which would help her with ducking inside and outside the shroud.  You could fine tune it in other ways.  You could let it function as a blind, so enemies inside it cannot see outside it at all, which would give it a huge amount of power (including for Akali's who are behind, which would allow her to benefit her team even when behind, which in turn reduces her binary nature).  Combine this with two other changes: Akali  does not reveal herself by using spells if she would otherwise be invisible; and allow q's to stack, while reducing the damage for procing a single q but greatly increase the damage for procing multiple q's.  This allows her upfront damage to be nerfed, forcing her to play around her (very) strong shroud to stack q's and then delete an opponent.  For example, the damage on 1 q stack could be  fairly small while  the damage from procing three q's could be stratospheric, instantly deleting an adc with negatron cloak. This would do two things -- she wouldn't be able to instantly delete targets when snowballing.  However, with careful use of shroud and q stacks, she could still delete squishies even when behind.  \n\nThis would fix most of her problems -- she could provide utility and still assasinate when behind, assassination would require skillful use of shroud and setting up q stacks, and she would not snowball as hard.  This is a healthy assassin playstyle.  \n\nI know you don't like this, but it is the only way to make the shroud meaningful late game while still allowing counterplay.","replies":[]}]}
