For example, I played an Udyr game recently where I refused to take the cloud drake because we would all get caught out and die if we took it. A Teemo on my team started absolutely flaying me for not taking the dragon, and every time the enemy team got a dragon or tower this Teemo would say &quot;Objectives aren&#039;t important.&quot; On multiple occasions he called me a &quot;Fucking bronzie noob&quot; for not taking objectives (when it was a bad time to). After that game, I got in a queue where I asked for top lane, and the top laner straight out refused to give me top lane because I was bronze. If you look at my op.gg, you can see that, yes, I have very bad winrates on Poppy and Kennen. I dropped both champs halfway through the season, and started maining Gnar and Kled in ranked. I have very good winrates on them, and they are the only reason I ended up in Bronze 1 this season. Please note that these games were in NORMAL GAMES.\r\n\r\nI feel like rank shaming has become a much bigger problem than it was before.","replies":[{"poster":"Best Vi Earth","date":"2017-12-30T20:15:54.116+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":5,"body":"wait and get a higher rank. prove people wrong. i dont see a problem","replies":[{"poster":"Hellmaximus1","date":"2017-12-30T20:28:48.874+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Best Vi Earth,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=0tEUkYkR,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-12-30T20:15:54.116+0000)\n>\n> wait and get a higher rank. prove people wrong. i dont see a problem\n\nHAHAHAHA, no just no.\n\nNo matter what rank you are, diamond, platinum, gold you will still be judged based on your rank, that's just how ranks are.\n\nDon't want to be called bronze? get silver and than get called silver, don't want to be called silver? get gold and get called gold, don't want to be gold? get platinum, in the end of the day the only people that get offended for being called their rank are those ASHAMED of their rank.","replies":[{"poster":"Best Vi Earth","date":"2017-12-30T20:51:35.712+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ok? once again i dont see a problem. some call it motivation but if you dont care about rank then get ranked shamed and post on the boards or replied even then you care about ranked?  mental fortitude is great in a situation such as that. remember you control what you see","replies":[{"poster":"Hellmaximus1","date":"2017-12-30T22:23:39.414+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Best Vi Earth,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=0tEUkYkR,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2017-12-30T20:51:35.712+0000)\n>\n> ok? once again i dont see a problem. some call it motivation but if you dont care about rank then get ranked shamed and post on the boards or replied even then you care about ranked?  mental fortitude is great in a situation such as that. remember you control what you see\n\nAnd also no matter what rank you're, there will always be somebody better than you that will make fun of your ranked.","replies":[{"poster":"Broken Bandle","date":"2017-12-30T22:48:04.015+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Hellmaximus1,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=0tEUkYkR,comment-id=0000000000000000,timestamp=2017-12-30T22:23:39.414+0000)\n>\n> And also no matter what rank you&#x27;re, there will always be somebody better than you that will make fun of your ranked.\n\nThis is so very true.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Broken Bandle","date":"2017-12-30T20:25:47.819+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can ask someone else for the lane that they have, but if they don't give it to you then you shouldn't be mad regardless of the reason.

And play fine in plat/get up to high plat. I think that certain areas of the game are harder to climb into or out of. Some things just can't be carried due to circumstances beyond your control. If someone wants to run their champion into the fountain 17 times, I can't stop that. Sometimes, it's just unlucky.\n\nMy point wasn't that elo hell exists or doesn't, perhaps my wording was poor. My point was that people in all elos know different things because they've all had different experiences? I personally don't put a lot of stock into the ranking system anymore after watching someone I know go from bronze 1 to plat 5 after being boosted there, then brag about being plat and used it to rank shame people below them. ( I even sent in a ticket with screen shots about the boosting wherein they admitted it and nothing happened.) Rank only has as much power as you give it, it's just another part of the mind game that is league.\n\nIf someone is bothering you, regardless of the source of their argument, just mute them.
