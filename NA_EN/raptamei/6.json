It's a thing.","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] General Discussion","up_votes":9,"down_votes":5,"body":"**The good**\r\n\r\nHotS is far more accessible than League. It *welcomes* new players, rather than tossing the runebook at them and telling them to grind 481208129 IP before they are allowed to have fun while matching them with screaming smurfs. This is big.\r\n\r\nThe game is full of modern conveniences: no runes/masteries, an actual try mode, chromas are free, the menus are slick and made in the actual game engine instead of being some Adobe Air based abomination.\r\n\r\nThe gameplay itself is more &quot;modern&quot; as well. Shared levels are huge, eliminating a ton of intra-team competition and bad blood resulting from power struggles over who gets blue and who gets the incoming minion wave. Mounts are easy to get used to and back in League it is hard to stop pressing W all the time. You can damage buildings with abilities, which may look like a minor thing until you go back to League and for some archaic and senseless reason you can&#039;t. Damage dealt, taken and farmed stats and XP contribution are far more useful than just a simple KD and CS display.\r\n\r\nTalents feel like an improvement over items. There is far less depth to be found in the talent system, but less useless memorisation as well and arguably more options. Items may add more complexity, but they do it in such an impenetrable way for newbies that Blizzard probably did the right thing.\r\n\r\nThere is a large variety of maps with interesting objectives and a surprising amount of depth, something that seems obvious in a modern game but Riot can&#039;t even figure out Magma Chamber or do something about League&#039;s interminable laning phase that is usually decided by external factors.\r\n\r\nGraphics are much better than League if you care about that.\r\n\r\nIn short, the game has solid fundamentals and lots of potential, far more than League at this point.\r\n\r\n**The bad**\r\n\r\nAnd yet Blizzard blew it.\r\n\r\nYou may have seen all the matchmaking complaints. The problem isn&#039;t matchmaking though. There&#039;s a design flaw with the game.\r\n\r\nThe most important skill at the level where most people play is teamplay. Individual skill makes very little difference due to the lack of playmaking abilities - for the most part you just press buttons in the direction of the enemy, run towards them if you&#039;re a tank, run away from them if you&#039;re a support.  Teamplay (being in the right place at the right time with the right number of people) is what makes or breaks matches. You may notice that you have no input in 4/5ths of this equation.\r\n\r\nYes, the game is *insanely* team dependent to the point where you feel powerless. You *need* everyone alive and present for objectives. You *need* to use those objectives properly as a team. You *need* your team to know about merc timings and not send mercs to their doom into the bone golem. You *need* your terror to not run his face into the enemy towers. At high levels of play, where everyone is doing the right thing, the game gets interesting; but at most levels, almost every match is decided by someone else on either team making a single decisive mistake, and the only thing you can do to advance is to not be that guy and bank on that 5/9 chance the enemy team will toss the game.\r\n\r\nSecondly, when people say &quot;no meta&quot;, they don&#039;t really mean it beyond &quot;the carry doesn&#039;t necessarily go bot&quot;. The game does have a meta: some FotM combination of assassins, warriors and healers (supports *must* be healers or they are not viable, and most supports have a very low skill cap, little to no damage, point and click cc and feel like literal healbots).\r\n\r\nBalance is an issue, and the problem runs deeper than just numbers: the heroes were designed for a game that allows deathballing, split pushing, farming, jungling, ganking and any combination of those, but the reality is that objectives are pretty much what determines the outcome and almost all of them force teamfights, so any talent/hero choice that doesn&#039;t contribute to teamfights is a noob trap (Gazlowe, Sylvanas&#039; push ult, Abathur).\r\n\r\nStealth is insanely badly designed. There are no wards and few abilities to reveal stealth. This is &quot;balanced&quot; because you can see a shimmer if you squint. Yes, Blizzard thought good eyesight should be a valuable skill in a moba. If you do have good eyesight, however, stealth may as well not exist, which is why one of the two stealth characters is a useless noobstomper and the other is only meta because of everything else in his kit.\r\n\r\nLastly, it feels as if most of their developers were pulled after launch. Post launch content is poverty row: two Diablo event maps that are literally the same map with or without a middle lane and with different objectives, Rexxar&#039;s pet control functionality is duct taped, and hero design has taken a turn for the CertainlyT school of giving new heroes everything they could possibly want in addition to power creep (look up Leoric and Johanna and their talents).\r\n\r\n**Just play both**\r\n\r\nHotS is far more accessible and easier to get into after a long day at work, but it feels like empty calories because you only make a few important decisions (&quot;do I turn in coins now or later&quot;) and the rest is just filler. Incredibly, they both have a place...","replies":[]}
