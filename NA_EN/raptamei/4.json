However, one player on each team is randomly appointed as the \"traitor\" before champion select starts. This player gets a loss if his team wins and a win if his team loses, and therefore has an incentive to toss the game. No one else on either team knows who the traitors are. (Edit: the enemy team knows who your traitor is and vice versa)\n\nThis player is not allowed to blatantly troll though: A team can start a vote against a player of their choice on their team at any time in game, declaring the target player the traitor. If they guess correctly, the team immediately wins and the traitor loses. If they guess wrong, the team loses and the traitor wins.\n\nNemesis draft was added as an answer to the misconception that low tier champs are \"useless\". Seeing as the community complains a lot about people who \"intentionally play bad\", perhaps we need this to demonstrate how difficult it is to actually do that.\n\n?","replies":[{"poster":"The5lacker","date":"2015-03-24T15:24:19.347+0000","up_votes":78,"down_votes":0,"body":"The idea is cute, but \"Guessing the traitor wins the game\" seems to make the rest of the game completely arbitrary. Why push when you can just play a guessing game?\n\nI'd say if you want to do something like this, look up \"Shadows over Camelot\" for an idea of how a Traitor would work, especially the process of outing them. In that game, one of the Knight of the Round Table is a traitor, and outing him limits his power but still allows him to participate in the game. However, accusing an loyal Knight costs you a point you need towards victory, and can only be done a certain amount of time into the game.\n\nI'd say outing a Traitor should initially make them targetable by your team as if they were an enemy champion, though you still retain all of their vision while they lose yours. Once you kill them, the enemy respawns on the enemy team, but your team gets some massive buff to compensate, like a perpetual Baron buff, and you also get *the enemy's traitor,* who likewise gets the buff. But if you guess wrong, you end up killing a teammate, which grants global gold to the enemy team, and then can't accuse another traitor for...5 minutes or so.","replies":[{"poster":"Old Man Teeto","date":"2015-03-24T17:03:35.585+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":2,"body":"Seems like a good idea.\n\nEvery 5 minutes each team can vote a traitor.

There should also be something to help people guess who the traitor is, but I have no ideas for that.\nAlso, after 3 tries, you shouldn't automatically lose the game, you should just be stuck with the dilemma of entrusting anything to the 2 players who haven't been voted traitor, and knowing that at any time, they can throw the game.\nOh, and if players blatantly put out that they are the traitor (trolling, saying it in chat, etc) the vote system should switch that player to the other team, (so basically you switch the old traitors), and then a new traitor is chosen. There's a catch though, while you think that the old traitor on the enemy side would be your new traitor, it's actually not. The traitor choosing is randomized, and only limited by the fact that your new person cannot ever be a traitor in that round. So if the next traitor calls out that he or she is a traitor, then the same process happens but the person that had gotten recently switched, can now be a traitor.\nBtw, this sounds like a fun game.","replies":[{"poster":"Raptamei","date":"2015-03-26T06:28:29.036+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Synticket,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=E9f3UmOv,comment-id=000100010001,timestamp=2015-03-26T02:49:02.602+0000)\n>\n> Also, after 3 tries, you shouldn't automatically lose the game, you should just be stuck with the dilemma of entrusting anything to the 2 players who haven't been voted traitor, and knowing that at any time, they can throw the game.\n\nThere is no dilemma. You HAVE to lose the game if you get it wrong. Otherwise it would be too tempting to just try a random vote and hope you get lucky (your suggestion of 3 tries would actually give you a 60% chance to win if you randomly vote). AND because you have to win if you get it right, in order to prevent the traitor from going afk or intentionally feeding in a very obvious manner.\n\nMost games would not be decided by votes. The vote system is only there to ensure the traitor is sufficiently subtle about it (possible improvement: show to the enemy team who the traitor is, so they can help the traitor make it not so obvious. Editing OP). If the traitor is subtle enough, then his team won't dare to vote.\n\nPeople who claim that it is not fun to instantly win just because the enemy got a traitor vote wrong have never had the enemy team surrender in a regular game. :p","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Chans Baby Boy","date":"2015-03-24T23:47:54.583+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"Cute idea but way to easy to just feed and what if their really bad but they just decide their feeding so they ban them its too hard to tell for intentional feeding on this game its wont work with the LoL community none of them care about the game enough they'll make a game hell just for spiting another player (s)","replies":[{"poster":"wop","date":"2015-03-25T00:01:15.564+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You obviously didn't take the time to read grasshopper","replies":[{"poster":"Rew711","date":"2015-03-25T14:58:10.240+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I want to be the one... who isn't it... but could be it.... when you least expect it.","replies":[{"poster":"wop","date":"2015-03-25T15:09:00.581+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Rew711,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=E9f3UmOv,comment-id=00010001000000000000,timestamp=2015-03-25T14:58:10.240+0000)\n>\n> I want to be the one... who isn't it... but could be it.... when you least expect it.\n\nfor some strange reason, I got a notification of this comment.
