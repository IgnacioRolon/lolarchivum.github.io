Maybe the difference between 1 tier at best. I got Silver 2 last season but got Bronze 3 this season. I don't get it, but what can you do. If you know you're  better than Bronze, it'll show down the road when you finally make it out. I know people who were Silver with me that got Bronze 5. Also know people who were Bronze 2 and got Silver 2. I think basing it off last seasons ranking is annoying, mainly because it screws out the lower MMR'd people and completely nullifies their prelim matches. This system was implemented for the high MMR'd Plat+ so they wouldn't have to spend so much time in lower ranks if they got unlucky in their prelim's.
