It's much more casual and fun. A lot of the mechanics that make League difficult (jungling, last hitting, playing support with minimal items, building items in the correct order, etc) are just plain absent with HotS.\n\nAre playing HotS instead, and giving their money to Blizzard.\n\nNow look around you and notice how few people really care about League and how many people are like the above.\n\nThat's why HotS is a threat to League. It's aiming for drooling idiots, of which there are lots and they have money.","replies":[]}
