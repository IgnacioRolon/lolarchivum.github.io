It's one thing when the mechanics essentially play themselves or are inherently simple and powerful. When you have to consistently execute it well to see results though it turns out to not always be true. Even in simpler settings they're more vulnerable to being countered out if they don't know why their choices are supposed to function a certain way and how to enforce that strength and shift gears to deal with outliers.\n\nSeason 2 ADCs were a perfect example. Low-tier play was dominated by bruisers and threads were filled with QQ about OP bruisers while the game we saw played at a high level was a completely different story. A true metagamer (who's goal is victory) would play to his opponents skill if the situation allows for it and would be more optimal. Path of least resistance. A full bruiser comp could have rolled you out of bronze and silver with ease at those levels of play with much less effort.\n\nThe reason was simple, bruisers had a higher mistake threshold for their lower output potential. Given high error prone players using higher risk but potentially stronger choices, the strength of the bruiser class was enhanced. They had more windows of opportunity to capitalize on than if the game was played at a higher skill level.\n\nNow this presents an issue wherein you're not practicing certain core mechanics in favor of using a gimmick, but I don't think the competitive setting is the place to really be working on your mechanical skill in the first place. You go into that setting to win and you should use and abuse all manner of game knowledge and skill that you have to do so. I also don't think you're necessarily developing good habits in general at that level against weaker players so it could be somewhat dismissed as a concern.\n\nThere are a lot of \"non-meta\" gimmicks in league that can be abused to crush pseudo-meta players because they don't optimize the strength of their choices.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Kijitow","date":"2015-01-04T04:16:54.720+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow, you SLAUGHTERED that strawman OP.
