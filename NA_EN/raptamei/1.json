If the enemy team is lacking in aoe cc, assassins, or single target cc, im picking Kalista.   i'm tired of everyone ranting about how op she is. I'm sorry that the champ you play, does not work in every match up. Champ diversity folks. Enemy team picks kalista, u pick Darius, Irelia, Jax, Maokai, Malphite, Sejuani, Nasus. All of  this champs would screw her over due to the fact that once she is slowed,  her passive is horrendous. Just like you have to build a team to stop kat, you have to do the same for Kalista. There is a such thing as champion diversity.","replies":[]}]}]}
