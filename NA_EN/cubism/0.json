This is fantastic! Definitely creepy, but with bravado, cold intelligence, and flamboyant. He&#039;s got the right amount of director, painter, actor, and musician to really define his status as the Virtuoso.

Finding the right balance is always difficult on these things.  You want his themes to be easily understandable, yet diverse enough to feel like a real (psychopathic) person with some depth.
