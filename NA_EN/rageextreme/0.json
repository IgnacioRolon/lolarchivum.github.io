Everyone can feel free to continue commenting, but I likely won't read the rest. I now understand two things that I did not before:\n\n1. I repeated \"zero-tolerance words,\" and, regardless of context, I was rightfully subjected to penalty.\n2.

Mute, report, and move on (I might put that on a t-shirt).\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Background:** \nI have been playing since before Season 1, and never had any action taken against my account (chat ban, suspension, etc.). Today I received a 14 day suspension. In the in-client explanation, it gave one chat log as reason for the suspension...I&#039;m trying to figure out how this got me suspended having never had a chat ban or anything else before. I was certainly argumentative, but the punishment does not seem to fit the crime to me; particularly, for a first-time offender.\n\n**Personal assessment**: \nMy only thought is that it was for the line: \n> RageExtreme: &quot;retard, f--g, f--gg--t&quot; that feels like the vocab i would expect from you,\n\nwhere I was quoting the other player, expressing that their game play and verbiage were equally toxic. Given that I was quoting him, and expressing that I don&#039;t agree with that language -- rather than expressing it towards anyone -- I&#039;m not sure though. \n\n**Questions:** \nDoes the suspension seem fair, as a first-time punishment, given the chat log (given me being argumentative/toxic during the game)? Do you guys think it was in error, believing I was using those nasty slurs towards somebody? \n\n**Chat log:**\nGame 1\nPre-Game\nRageExtreme: pref jg\nIn-Game\nRageExtreme: gj\nRageExtreme: he had 3\nRageExtreme: to wus 2\nRageExtreme: care...we used all ults for that lol\nRageExtreme: why you walk away at first man....it was free kill...then why go in when im leaving?\nRageExtreme: like...\nRageExtreme: either do or do not\nRageExtreme: dont decide not to, then bait, then get us both killed\nRageExtreme: yeah\nRageExtreme: i was just harassing him\nRageExtreme: and keeping there\nRageExtreme: then was backing out\nRageExtreme: so you could turret or altar etc\nRageExtreme: i don&#039;t get you man\nRageExtreme: we burnt flash\nRageExtreme: be happy\nRageExtreme: back out\nRageExtreme: talk to 0-7 ahri\nRageExtreme: not saying she is\nRageExtreme: why you fighting garen first...\nRageExtreme: setup with us\nRageExtreme: kill the other two\nRageExtreme: you are just fucking trying to lose\nRageExtreme: you are literally chasing him\nRageExtreme: in lane\nRageExtreme: exactly\nRageExtreme: trying to lose\nRageExtreme: wtf you talking about\nRageExtreme: we are there\nRageExtreme: setting up in bush\nRageExtreme: on obv collapse\nRageExtreme: and you still chasing him\nRageExtreme: in lane\nRageExtreme: ffs\nRageExtreme: troll af\nRageExtreme: he&#039;s a troll\nRageExtreme: that&#039;s why\nRageExtreme: he wants out\nRageExtreme: we didn&#039;t ff\nRageExtreme: so now he isn&#039;t playing\nRageExtreme: &quot;retard, f--g, f--gg--t&quot; that feels like the vocab i would expect from you.\nRageExtreme: report for slurs wu\nRageExtreme: gg man, gl on your next\nPost-Game\nRageExtreme: report her for the slurs wu....she will def at least get a chat ban for that\nRageExtreme: save it man\nRageExtreme: you told us you quit\nRageExtreme: and that you were done\nRageExtreme: you started it by quitting\nRageExtreme: when we refused to ff\nRageExtreme: then ran it up lane at the garen\nRageExtreme: how was it 1v2 bot...if ahri was 0-7...\nRageExtreme: fair point, gg wu","replies":[{"poster":"Chermorg","date":"2018-07-03T23:45:40.917+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":3,"body":"Yes, it's fair, and no, it's not in error.\n\nThere is never any reason to repeat what someone else says.

I was much more aggro than I normally am in chat (admittedly, I had a bad day and was probably projecting that) and so I didn't know if what I said (other than the quote) would normally warrant a suspension. Lesson learned, I'll just mute everyone and avoid chat from now on. Having played the game for almost a decade now it feels very upsetting to be punished so harshly -- but not much to be done now I suppose. I'll just completely stay out of chat.","replies":[{"poster":"Voldymort","date":"2018-07-04T05:45:35.508+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"It should be mentioned that not talking in chat will make the punishments decrease in severity at a much slower rate than if you were using it to talk in a non toxic manner.

Alas, the majority of the playerbase thinks that way...\n\nYes, I believe that part of the problem is that it actually used to work that way. During the tribunal days, and even pre-tribunal days, it seems that multiple reports were more impactful than individual reports. Riot seems to have done very little in terms of informing the player bases of the way the new system works, and so it is very common to read something to the affect of \"PLAYERX was a troll, 9x him\" in all chat -- often as a legitimate plea. I understand that it is a **fair** system to say that my repetition of the slurs warrants equal punishment, but I have a hard time believing it is a **just** system. That said, you were correct in an earlier comment that I could have done more research, but as a player that has never (in approx 10 years of playing), and would never utter a slur towards another player, a chat ban would have been more than sufficient to \"inform,\" and subsequently \"reform,\" me. I appreciate your comments thought, particularly the one letting me know that not chatting will make the punishment severity decrease at a slower rate -- that was something I was unaware of.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Aneirin","date":"2018-07-05T04:01:29.605+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Thanks for the feedback.
