I think people are really going to like this tank update. Let's get the idea going around the office.\nMeddler: Great, I've got lunch planned with Reav3 and Broporo today. I'll be sure to let those bros know.\nGhostcrawler: You can tell Reav3, but not that Broporo guy. Remember what happened with Ao Shin? Yeah. That was Broporo and Reddit.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"TerraRising","date":"2017-06-26T05:24:44.377+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Let's get a few things out of the way:\n\n1. **Yorick's not getting another rework.**  He's not Ryze, after all.\n2. **Yorick just received some QoL changes.**  Check out the Patch notes for 7.10.\n3. **Yorick was _intentionally_ remade to not fit the meta.**  True split-pushing isn't as viable a strategy right now as teamfighting around Baron.  Also, there are other champs who split-push better than Yorick.\n4. **Yorick's minions make him inviable in competitive play.**  IF they were, Yorick would run roughshod against lower levels... at least, that's what Ghostcrawler has said. (Same goes for Heimerdinger, too!)\n5. **Yorick needs a bigger playerbase.** More players mean more losses and a better shot at getting real buffs.  What would get that bigger playerbase?  A really awesome skin that would make people take notice.","replies":[]}]}
