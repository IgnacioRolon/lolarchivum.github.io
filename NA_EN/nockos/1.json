If I can get a duo or a 3-4 man to report me for reacting, then I want them to get the same punishment. \r\n\r\nIt&#039;s really sad when the enemy is more friendly and helpful than your own fucking team at giving advice.

It just flags the game for review, then when a review is triggered if there is no toxicity it throws it out.
