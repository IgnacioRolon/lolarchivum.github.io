I was getting honors and getting my rewards back. I even made a couple of new friends and was voted most honorable in my next 3-6 games afterwards. \r\n\r\nNow here&#039;s some stupid shit: Apparently I&#039;m too retarded to learn to not respond to people harassing me over mistakes. They can and will report for responding to their actions. I know my language was a shitty and I should have just muted, but I have a really good question for Riot.\r\n\r\nHow is it fair that premade group is allowed to harass a solo que player, spam &quot;?&quot; ping them all game, tell them that they are shitty and need to stop inting, and if that solo que player responds, they get reported and punished harder than those starting the conflict? What happened to the tribunal? \r\n\r\nNo I dont need you to post the chat logs, I&#039;m well aware of what I said. But it&#039;s some major league bullshit that people are allowed to intentionally start problems, and report you if you respond in any harsh way. \r\n\r\nI can try to fight my permaban, but that&#039;s useless. I could make an alt, but that would be equally useless. I just want to point out that if people are allowed to harass somebody into a salty rage, which can be done without words ( you cant mute actions) then they should get the same amount of punishment as the people they harass and report. \r\n\r\nAlso (you&#039;re only making this post because you&#039;re permabanned and mad.) \r\nNo, Im making this for the fact that this automated system is worse than the tribunal and players who start problems get away with too much in this game. Muting could solve it but muting will not stop them from trying to find ways to tilt you. Dont do what I did and get tilted.

I bet people who don't respond ALSO don't report these people, and that may be the problem to focus on.
