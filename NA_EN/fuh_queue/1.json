So you'd either go predator and take celerity (nerfed, maybe not good anymore) or take transcendence (keystone doesn't matter here for raw ap - go whatever you want. probably domination too because eyeball collection).\n\nI typically only play the CDR setup on Karthus, and it's usually bad too but i just like big numbers.\n\n1. Rush Seraph's. You get the mana scaling, 20% CDR and AP.\n\n2. Get Luden's. You get AP, more mana to scale the Seraph passive, and more CDR. You'll have 40% now.\n\n3. From this point, any CDR you get gives you AP, any mana you get gives you AP. Every 100 mana would give you 3 AP, every 10% CDR would give you 24 AP.\n\nHere's a few example items:\n\n{{item:3030}} 80 base AP + 18 AP (mana) + 24 AP (CDR) = 122 AP\n{{item:3100}} 80 base AP + 7.5 AP (mana) + 24 AP (CDR) = 111.5 AP\n{{item:3115}} 80 base AP + 48 AP (CDR) = 128 AP\n{{item:3027}} 100 base AP + 12 AP (mana) = 112 AP\n\n\nOld Morellonomicon used to be perfect with the 20% CDR, 100 AP and ~400? mana it used to give but that no longer exists.\n\nSometime in your game, you'll obviously have to get {{item:3089}}.\n\nAs a standalone item, {{item:3041}} also gives a shitload of AP but you're unlikely to be able to get past the early game to snowball that far.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DaNinad","date":"2017-01-22T22:00:46.974+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"5 rabadon deathcaps?","replies":[{"poster":"PopperFeine420","date":"2017-08-09T13:51:41.988+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What about mejais and seraphs smh no imagination","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"deadlychuck","date":"2017-01-22T22:21:03.793+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Generally someone has done the math for the maximum possible of each stat on the wiki pages.\n\nhttp://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Ability_power","replies":[]},{"poster":"Blue Kaozi","date":"2017-01-22T22:08:33.210+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im pretty sure its technically still 4 seraphs + rabadons, but I dont really want to do math right now.
