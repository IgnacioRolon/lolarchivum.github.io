I cannot answer that for you. I enjoy LuLu because of the way she laughs. I enjoy Zilean because his revive can tilt players. I enjoy Draven because catching axes is pretty much a mini game, etc. It's really up to you what you want to main. Question is, how do you wish to impact the game and what role appeases you most?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rhythloday","date":"2016-11-09T01:38:59.407+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Idk if I can bump to try and get answer....","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-11-08T22:25:04.798+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Uh.. by \"top\", is that meant to mean top lane? Because almost all of those are not top lane champions.\n\nThere is just about nothing in common between them, and i have a feeling you have no idea how to play most of them properly. For example azir and ori are very difficult to play and would do badly in top lane. evelyn is not even a laner and has no real way to play in a 1v1 situation.","replies":[{"poster":"Rhythloday","date":"2016-11-08T23:55:07.223+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No!

Thanks!\n\nEuh, you don't seem to have a understanding of top lane and its intended purpose. Perhaps you should read up on the top lane instead of just naming random champs.","replies":[{"poster":"Rhythloday","date":"2016-11-08T23:54:17.513+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No. That is not what I meant I meant my own personal \"top\" likes.
