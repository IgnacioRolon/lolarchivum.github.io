The client itself lags during animations, and whenever I play it&#039;s normally fine until I get into team fights, making it kinda difficult for me to do good late game. I&#039;ve tried re-downloading League, set my processor usage to %40, restarting computer, nothing seems to work.

On NVidia, you do this from \"Nvidia control panel > Manage 3D settings > ProgramSettings\"\n\nIf on windows 10, with the july update, just panic and maybe set your computer on fire, or consider installing a less shitty OS. Disable the \"game bar\" crap, it does horrible things.\n\nTry switching LoL to fullscreen, sometimes borderless bugs out and limits FpS to something like 10-15 with certain other programs running, especially overlays (like steam shit, xbone gamebar shit).","replies":[{"poster":"ABigSchett","date":"2016-10-08T07:54:29.320+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's still running like shit...
