It's an ISP issue.\nMost common causes are Comcast and Level3 throttling LoL traffic.\n\nThe safest thing is complaining to your ISP and give Riot support the requested information.\n\nI had 6 weeks of packet loss fixed within days after doing that.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Jesus is Savior","date":"2014-10-21T10:50:11.260+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It has been 8 days since superfoxman has replied to his thread about this.
