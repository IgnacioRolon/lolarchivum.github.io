I usually recive +20lp for a win and -15 for a loose. \r\nI had 0 points when i started today games and won 3 games in row, so i should have 60 points, but instead after 3 won games i had 40 points. \r\nI tought it will just load later on, but after 2 more games i still didnt recive my LP for the win.  (If you look in my history game, it was the game where i played{{champion:103}}. \r\nAfter the {{champion:103}} game, the score board didnt load, so i just skipped that, but i didnt recive any LP for the win. \r\nI lost 2 games after that and now after 3 wins and 2 looses i am on 8 points, but i should have ~25 LP.\r\n\r\nWas it only me, or some1 had same thing today?\r\n\r\nPS. All the games were Solo/Duo, it was not my mistake if you would want to say \"Maybe u played normal draft\" or something.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-23T03:21:00.706+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"After checking the [**Status Page**](http://status.leagueoflegends.com/#eune), it looks like EUNE is still dealing with these LP troubles.
