Meaning if you had 100 ad you would gain 25 base ad whenever its active but, say if you built a steraks gage which increases your base ad by 50%, now your base ad should be at 150 which means that Aatrox passive should give you 12.5+25 more base ad. But that is not the case.\r\n\r\nexample:\r\nyou have 70 ad at lvl 1 and your passive gives you +18 base ad whenever active.\r\nhttps://i.imgur.com/EZxHnAB.png\r\n\r\nwith steraks gage, you would have a total of 105 ad at lvl, which means your passive would give you 26 base ad instead of 18. \r\nhttps://i.imgur.com/78gaV3k.png\r\n\r\nBut that is not the case in picture 3 where my passive is active at lvl 1 with steraks gage, giving me a whole total of only +18 ad.\r\nhttps://i.imgur.com/WsjBr1T.png\r\n\r\n\r\nis this a bug or intended?","replies":[{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2017-12-15T17:51:27.144+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm pretty sure the effects would be additive.

I.e it says +26 on the passive but i didnt take a picture of it, just go in a training game and check yourself.","replies":[{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2017-12-15T23:03:55.714+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Probably a tooltip bug.

Aatrox at level one base AD is 70. If you have your passive you'll get 25% of your base AD, but the total is no longer \"base\" AD. It is a modified total. So you'll have a modified AD of 88. 70 base + 18 from passive or 70+(70*.25) . \n\nWhen you calculate the additional from steraks gage, you still use the base AD of 70. This will give you a modified AD of 123 or 70+(70x.25)+(70x.50).","replies":[{"poster":"Hello I am Bird","date":"2017-12-17T04:56:21.988+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pretty sure Sterak's is unique in that it's extra AD doesn't add to your modified AD, it adds to your *base AD*\n\nThe tooltip says \"UNIQUE: +50% base attack damage.\"","replies":[{"poster":"Summer Arosa","date":"2017-12-18T18:35:20.239+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My calculation is consistent with what is showing in game, also base AD to my knowledge should not be altered by anything other than a champion's scaling. This could be more of a wording issue on Steraks Gauge. For me I'm reading it as an additional %50 Attack Damage calculated from your base attack damage.\n\nThese are the definitions I'm using:\n\n\"*Base AD is the portion of attack damage which originates from the champion itself. It is the sum of a constant base value that is individual for every champion plus a growth component which increases as the champion levels up.\n\n*Bonus AD (or modified AD in my example) is the portion of attack damage which originates from runes, abilities, auras and, most importantly, items.\"","replies":[{"poster":"Hello I am Bird","date":"2017-12-18T19:58:34.075+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think that you're 100% correct in your definitions, but I think the purpose of Sterak's Gauge was for it to be an exception to that rule.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"ReapersGrim","date":"2017-12-16T07:17:45.728+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tool-tip is faulty, they function in an additive manner.","replies":[{"poster":"ReapersGrim","date":"2017-12-16T07:20:39.919+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also if you haven't noticed they buffed his Q and E base damages in patch notes; in game they aren't buffed.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ShishouMatt","date":"2017-12-15T18:39:03.008+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hrmmmmm, curious","replies":[]}]}
