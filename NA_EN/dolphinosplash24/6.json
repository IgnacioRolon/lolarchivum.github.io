So at least toss one auto in there with a toxic dot proc just to make it a more conservative scenario. My suggestion and 2 cents. Though if its a good teemo I still believe this person is probably experiencing the full combo of auto,q,auto,thunderlords.

Though i dunno much on this subject honestly), supposedly a lot of spells do that, you do have to wait till the spell you are using to finish before you can auto attack again though but the actual wikia page on teemo when popping the more info doesn't list the Q as an auto attack reset. searching google has some sites listing it as an auto attack reset, and some people asking why other people think it is as they say that it is not. I dunno. but I have played him on minor occasions and it 'feels' to me that it is resetting the autoattack timer even if it is not. It feels same as darius auto, w, auto to me. I don't play either of them often or hardly at all. It has always felt like a reset. there are others who say it is one. I think if it cancels any part of an animation at end of one auto or at beginning of another it is at least a partial reset. guess there are true resets and partial resets in that a normal riven doesn't auto attack as fast as an animation canceling riven, her spells aren't true resets but a person that uses them to cancel animations is effectively increasing her autoattack speed and murdering people. teemo's q may not be a true reset but i don't know the answer, it sure as heck feels like one. :)\n\np.s. supposedly tiamat active resets autos to and i think even the wikia page says it does, but seen arguments similar to what you make saying that it really doesn't. This may be one of those things :P.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Aptest","date":"2017-02-04T19:28:28.096+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the same reason lux is allowed to.\nthe same reason zed is allowed to. \ncomes with having big skills with big damage.","replies":[{"poster":"dolphinosplash24","date":"2017-02-04T19:30:16.637+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Aptest,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=4z9aYb5E,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2017-02-04T19:28:28.096+0000)\n>\n> the same reason lux is allowed to.\n> the same reason zed is allowed to. \n> comes with having big skills with big damage.\n\nwith lux and zed thy are dodgable","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ScissorsNstuff","date":"2017-02-04T19:30:12.403+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"what's wrong with that","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Whamboozler","date":"2017-02-04T19:22:27.148+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because you bought a {{item:3077}} and no MR, ya scrub.","replies":[]},{"poster":"dakota saturn","date":"2017-02-04T18:59:48.792+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And all you have to do vs teemo is not die to him before lv 5 and you auto win the lane.","replies":[]}]}
