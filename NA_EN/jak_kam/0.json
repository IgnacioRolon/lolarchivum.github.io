You can bring your AS back up to its proper value by sending an autoattack command. So, with Titanic, you have to be spamming right-click on your target while you use the active, or you basically end up briefly CCing yourself.

Let's say you're Xin, you E into a fight, and a support with Ardent Censer heals you. That's some significant bonus AS right there. But, as soon as you use Titanic Hydra's active, all that bonus AS disappears and you just kinda stand there for a bit.
