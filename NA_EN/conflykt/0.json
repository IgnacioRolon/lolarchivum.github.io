And yes I feel you with these ratings... I feel cheated I didn't get an S- at least on some of a couple of my Volibear and Xin games.\n\nVolibear Jungle: 11/2/12 35 minute game, 74 CS, maybe the CS is why but then again I was in the jungle...\n\nXin Top Lane: 18/3/6 36 minute game, 78 CS, I dealt the most damage, took the most damage, and had a killing spree of 8. Come on! That was definitely one of my best Xin games, I was shocked to see no S.","replies":[{"poster":"sheldonbunny","date":"2016-05-24T04:40:55.796+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=xWaters,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=24kmEJEt,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-05-24T02:30:36.001+0000)\n>\n> Xin Top Lane: 18/3/6 36 minute game, 78 CS, I dealt the most damage, took the most damage, and had a killing spree of 8.

In that amount of time you should have warded at least 15 times, if not more.","replies":[]}]}]}
