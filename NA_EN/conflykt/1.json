I know this kinda sounds complicated.\r\n\r\nThe biggest example I see is when I&#039;m taking the T3 towers/inhibitors. I will put turrets between the enemy tower and inhibitor. They target the tower, destroy it, but then sit there and don&#039;t attack the inhibitor well within range. Is this intentional? The only way to &quot;fix&quot; this is to recast my turret altogether.\r\n\r\nThanks guys, keep up the good work!\r\n\r\nConflykt","replies":[{"poster":"Conflykt","date":"2017-09-16T00:16:40.898+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Seems to be an inhibitor problem in general.
