The count down which is pretty short now gets to 0 and I am stuck in the pick screen with the counter 0 but my friends see me out of the pick screen but in the queue screen.  In the stuck screen it wasnt frozen i could pick other champs just it didn't make a difference, it got fixed when they kicked me from the queue but I still got a 15 minute priority queue ban :(\r\nI got an error message when in the pick phase but I didn't read it sorry.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-14T03:40:17.265+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmm it sounds like your client lost its connection with the servers, so you weren't able to login since the client wasn't able to communicate with the servers at all during that time.
