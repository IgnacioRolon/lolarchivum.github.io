When I try to open the admin version, it asks to make changes and after you click yes, nothing happens. The league icon doesnt even show up. When i open the client it works but when i try to go into a game, it doesnt even go into the loading screen and goes directly to \"reconnect\". I do not have the lol air client folder and the only time league works is when i reinstall and wait for everything to patch so that i can play.","replies":[{"poster":"Son of Ornn","date":"2017-07-04T02:42:18.373+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That sounds almost like you're experiencing two problems; connection interference and permissions problems.\n\nFor starters, I want to make sure that nothing is interrupting either your installs or your games. For that I suggest going through the steps in [**this guide here**](http://riot.com/12B7oac) to assure nothing is blocking you. In particular, make sure that all your firewalls and AV softwares are disabled.\n\nIf you don't see better results after that, try and make sure your permissions settings are letting LoL play. It was a good idea running as admin, but running through [**this guide**](http://riot.com/1SB1JXQ) will also remove any potential road bumps. If you're still getting those errors after that, you may need to let Tech Support take look [**in a ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new). They'll be able to look in depth into what's causing both the Kernel.exe bug and forcing you to the reconnect screen over and over. :)","replies":[]}]}
