In my pursuit of vigilante justice, I have been extremely rude to these \"humans\" and have taken down those posts as a sign of solidarity to the community (you guys!) who have given me the most joy. NOW: onto my main point my ban should be overturned completely and absolutely. As previously established, I have been a loyal, active, and enlightened boards community member, for that alone this appeal is convincing. BUT: a little background info: my helpful teammate decided to INTENTIONALLY ban my otp (rengar). so i calm down, ground myself like da champ, fix my posture etc. and i say \"ok let me try that funky ryze build my flatmate sent me on discord that other night at the deli\". yeah uhh turns out the build is GARBAGE, no resists, no mana, little utility and its weak to drain tanks. DESPITE ALL OF THIS: I still had the most damage on my team by a large margin. is that not persistence or what? Despite all of this, I was banned........easy to say the system failed here\n\nConclusion: the only thing I can do now is ask riot to unban my account, 14 days is still 14 too many\n\n\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[{"poster":"PresBushDid711","date":"2020-01-02T22:52:44.735+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":0,"body":"0/28 with 15cs in a 34 min game.\n\nMaybe don't troll games, no \" bad build\" is going to lead to 15 cs.\n\nEdit: You had 1 cs from 4 mins to 16 mins...

From what it sounds like, you tried to game the system and got played. You can call it what you want, but it sounds like you weren't trying to be innovative, or creative in good faith.
