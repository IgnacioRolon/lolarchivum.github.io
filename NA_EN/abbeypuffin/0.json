EDITED .... I ...., and EXCLUDED........ ....)\nand even excluding the most important parts where i was defending myself AND i had even ignored ALL their insults.\nit&#039;s as if he thinks providing swiss cheese textlogs somehow portrays me as a bad guy?\noh look here guys,  i said teh F word!!! GASP!\nnot even used as an insult either.\njust mysteriously found the F word?\nROFLMAO - you gotta wonder what the other players were saying that would cause somebody to REPLY in such a manner???\n... \"it&#039;s not as if anybody will know after i EDIT the chat logs!  &gt;:D  \"\n\nhow can i reply to... nothing?\nit&#039;s as if this guy expects people to believe that i supposedly sat there and had a convo with myself and nobody else said anything.\n\napparently i cant share my chat logs in public tho.\nbut if i could then a healthy minded individual could recognize what was said is a RESULT of other comments.\n\nhe also full out deleted entire sentences and only leaving ONE or TWO WORDS\n\ni asked for another moderator to review my ticket but he replied  &quot;There isn&#039;t any level of escalation that will get you the answer that you want. &quot;\nso apparently im dealing with a NARCISSISTIC moderator,  so i have to bring this to public attention.\n\n&quot;There isn&#039;t any level of escalation that will get you the answer that you want. &quot;  has got to be the most toxic thing i have ever heard.\n\nif another moderator had gave me the same interpretation , then it would be different.\n\nbut i feel because he knows he made a mistake that will look bad on his tribunal history\ntherefor he feels the need to cover up and falsely represent the chat logs.\n\nand i feel he denies my right to fair treatment by refusing to forward my ticket to another moderator would be yet another indication that he is not properly motivated or does not meet the empathic aptitude that is REQUIRED for moderation.","replies":[{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-02-07T02:15:37.007+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't vote in polls.\n\nAlso, I am confused as to what you are talking about. The Tribunal isn't a thing anymore, are you saying you made a support ticket and they gave you edited logs? You should have an email that the automated system sent to you, so nobody would have a chance to edit them. It should also give you some when you log in.\n\nThey never give you the logs of other people that were in your matches because context does not matter. It does not matter if you were replying to somebody, you were still helping create a negative environment for your teammates. You are only responsible for what you said, so they only give you your chat logs.\n\nI have never heard of a rule saying you can't share your logs in public and people do it on these forums all the times, both for support tickets and for your reform card logs.","replies":[{"poster":"Ulanopo","date":"2017-02-07T02:43:12.706+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">They never give you the logs of other people that were in your matches because context does not matter.\n\nWhile it's true that context does not matter, the logs players receive from the game client do include chat from other players. It just doesn't use the IGN of anyone but that player.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Magical Player","date":"2017-02-07T02:41:41.824+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Post your edited logs?","replies":[]}]}
