I tried refreshing. Restarted the client. I accessed MY SHOP and got all the skins that I want at a heavy discount. I wanna buy them now but the shop icon just isn't showing up no matter how many times I restart my client! I hope this gets resolved before the MY SHOP is officially gone! I WANT THOSE SKINS! {{item:3070}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Infernate","date":"2017-05-19T20:07:35.981+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The same thing happened to me except I didn't have it open in queue. What actually happened was I got discounts for champions I never used except for one Alistar skin which I bought. Then after a game the shop disappeared and I couldn't get it back until today. This time, my shop has completely different discounts. Before I had 2 Trundle skins, a Brand skin, a Malzahar skin, and an Alistar skin. This time I have a Yasuo skin, a riven skin, a Warwick skin, a Tristana skin, and a Rengar skin. All of which I have level 6 or above in mastery. It's a bit odd but at least I got the discounted Alistar skin while it was there.","replies":[]}]}
