I'm back with something a little different this time; some concept work done for a project I worked on together with my awesome friends of Rift Artisans. You might also remember the fanmade [Demon Teemo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me_O-_JYekk) project we worked on!\r\n\r\nThis project is a skin concept for Syndra, turning her into a Star Guardian gone rogue. It has been under work for almost a year now! I had the fun chance to work on both the concept art and the splash for this project. We started work on this before the official Star Guardian Syndra was announced so the leaks set us on quite the emotional rollercoaster. Our version is a bit darker than the official one, as her backstory mirrors base Syndra's somewhat. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately due to personal circumstances the team wasn't able to put together a video like the last time, but we're going to be posting them individually, so look forward to them uploading their work! \r\n\r\nAnyway, this was a lot of fun to work on, and I learned a lot! Thanks for looking and as always, feel free to drop any critique in the comments, always appreciate it when you do that.\r\n\r\nhttps://cdnb.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/007/242/643/large/vlx-bacescu-splash.jpg\r\n\r\nhttps://cdna.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/007/242/640/large/vlx-bacescu-1.jpg\r\n\r\nhttps://cdna.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/007/242/642/large/vlx-bacescu-2.jpg\r\n\r\nhttps://cdnb.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/007/243/361/large/vlx-bacescu-7.jpg?1504720857\r\n\r\nhttps://cdna.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/007/242/644/large/vlx-bacescu-3.jpg?1504716580\r\n\r\nhttps://cdna.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/007/242/646/large/vlx-bacescu-4.jpg?1504716584\r\n\r\nhttps://cdna.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/007/242/660/large/vlx-bacescu-15385338-1257634500949217-5030732708317858317-o.jpg?1504716602\r\n\r\nAt one point, we explored the idea of having her outfit 'upgrade' itself whenever you put a point into R.

They just decided not to do it.\n\nHowever, I must admit that, even though I _am_ an Ahri main, I don't really agree with their decision. The current Syndra VO would've gone well with a SG villain skin, but an actual SG skin for her should've been paired with a nice VO to show another side of Syndra, like what she could've been if she hadn't been so dark. :P The one we're getting just feels wrong.","replies":[{"poster":"NineTailedMystic","date":"2017-09-07T03:01:19.329+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The thing is, Ahri needed at least 1 high tier skin, and SG is it.

I really doubt Ahri will be getting any skins for a long time now.

Syndra needs a high tier skin, Soraka, Miss Fortune, ect... That's kinda a bad argument. Now I'm not one of those people who spam yorick blah blah blah, and I don't think riot purposely makes skins towards popular champs, but legendary skins are 15$ so it would make a lot more sense to give it to arguably one of the most iconic league characters than say soraka. \n\nPS You're being a bit dramatic with the whole, \"might be ahri's last skin depending on how long League will live\" thing.","replies":[{"poster":"NineTailedMystic","date":"2017-09-07T07:47:46.654+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Every champ needs a high tier (Legendary/Ultimate) skin.

Star Guardian will be her eighth skin, if I counted right, and will be an 1820 Legendary. You (probably) saw the outrage on the boards about \"omg another ahri skin\" except this time it was worse because it was the Legendary of the set.

My point is, you say that Ahri needed one, you could say the same for Syndra, Soraka, Miss Fortune, Lulu, and the rest of them. Also yes I agree she probably won't get one for at least 2 years, but let's be real for a second here.
