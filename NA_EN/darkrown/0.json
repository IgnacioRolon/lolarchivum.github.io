Here's a skin concept I've been working on for the past few days for Heimer. Since he got buffed/adjusted I've seen him popping up in my games a bit more often. I've also been watching a looot of Heisendong's stream lately so I was feeling the itch to draw some Heimer. His last skin was Hazmat three years ago, so I think he'd be up for a new one soon, and Dragon Trainer is my favorite Yordle skin line, so I thought, why not?\r\n\r\nAnyway, thanks for checking this out! Hope you like my idea and if you have any feedback to share, feel free to drop it below, I'm always open to critique. Cheers~\r\n\r\nhttps://cdnb.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/006/390/791/large/vlx-bacescu-1-ingame.jpg?1498219954\r\n\r\nhttps://cdna.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/006/390/794/large/vlx-bacescu-2-heimer-color-final.jpg?1498219855\r\n\r\nhttps://cdna.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/006/390/798/large/vlx-bacescu-3-ingame-r-qpassive.jpg?1498219860\r\n\r\nhttps://cdnb.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/006/390/801/large/vlx-bacescu-4-dragons-in-game.jpg?1498219866\r\n\r\nhttps://cdnb.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/006/390/803/large/vlx-bacescu-5-q.jpg?1498219871\r\n\r\nhttps://cdnb.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/006/390/789/large/vlx-bacescu-6-w.jpg?1498219846\r\n\r\nhttps://cdna.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/006/390/790/large/vlx-bacescu-7-e.jpg?1498219849\r\n\r\nhttps://cdnb.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/006/390/793/large/vlx-bacescu-8-recall.jpg?1498219853\r\nrecall concept~\r\nhttps://cdna.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/006/390/796/large/vlx-bacescu-9-process.jpg?1498219856\r\nsome wip shots~\r\nhttps://cdnb.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/006/390/797/large/vlx-bacescu-10-illustration.jpg?1498219863","replies":[{"poster":"efflam","date":"2017-06-23T22:04:52.886+0000","up_votes":78,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am a Heimer one trick and I would play this :D\nDigging the orange-haired one in WIPs\n\n {{champion:74}}  ~_ Indeeeeeeeeed, a wise choice_  !~","replies":[{"poster":"Rito Staff","date":"2017-06-23T23:56:44.576+0000","up_votes":22,"down_votes":2,"body":"Pull some strings then c:","replies":[{"poster":"efflam","date":"2017-06-24T07:17:32.735+0000","up_votes":31,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm way too biased ! :)\n\nWe gotta get that play rate up tho,  one day Heimer will get the love he deserves.\n_Heimer mains unite_","replies":[{"poster":"J Epstein","date":"2017-06-25T02:35:52.889+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=efflam,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=ksi4Hxtr,comment-id=002e00020000,timestamp=2017-06-24T07:17:32.735+0000)\n\n> \n> We gotta get that play rate up tho,  one day Heimer will get the love he deserves.\n\nand its finally confirmed by a rioter.  only champs with a high play rate get cool skins.","replies":[{"poster":"lol who cares","date":"2017-06-27T23:05:37.590+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":5,"body":"Everyone who complains about this is just demonstrating complete lack of brain cells.\n\nFirstly, champions aren't REAL.
