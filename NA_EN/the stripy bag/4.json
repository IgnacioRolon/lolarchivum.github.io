I mean the cc you get from hitting enemies it the same amount of time that you get cc&#039;d for using this thing and the slow field doesn&#039;t last long enough to make an impact either and this is if you hit someone with this thing! So you basically just slammed yourself into the enemy team and basically special delivered yourself as a free kill. I mean Riot can you change it so maybe it&#039;s like a Sion ult where if we mess it up we get stunned but if we land it we don&#039;t cause it sucks to use right now and makes me feel like I&#039;d rather have the catapult since it&#039;s more accurate,everyone can go where they want with it, and you don&#039;t get self cc&#039;d to death for using it right.{{sticker:zombie-nunu-bummed}}","replies":[{"poster":"Death Pierce Me","date":"2018-12-08T19:17:00.845+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm still trying to figure out how to activate it","replies":[{"poster":"The Stripy Bag","date":"2018-12-08T21:15:37.777+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's kinda weird but you gotta click on it then you control it like a Sion ult.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-12-11T03:32:46.326+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It does vile amounts of damage if you use it right, generally you want to plow into an existing fight instead of just inting with it.","replies":[]}]}
