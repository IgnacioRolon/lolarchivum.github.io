Heck this would probably work really well as the Noxian support everyone has been asking for but focusing less on CC and Heals but rather on buffs and leading the charge be it to run down the last of the enemy or rallying everyone to make a stand. Like make the passive something along the lines of every time an Enemy Champion,Turret,Epic monster,or enough minions are killed they plant a flag sort of like J4 that buffs allies offensive stats near them and maybe their ultimate is centered on rallying your team by charging forward like Kled or Rakan ults and buffing their defensive stats while also giving them shields based off missing HP and advanced regen. This way it could be your team is getting sieged or pushed back but you rush forward and all those who fight alongside you gain a second wind to fight for glory and victory. Maybe the balance being they have to be in combat to get your buffs and rapidly lose them if they remain out of combat. Probably being an officer of Noxus who leads their troops from the front and is famous for rallying victories. I don't know I'm just trying to spit ball here because yeah we don't really have an inspiration focused support. Maybe to the team mates who are running from battle they shout obscenities at them and calling them cowards while everyone who does fight with them they shout about showing the world what they see in them and giving it their all. Could even make them another minotaur or vastaya with a massive battle axe,halberd,or spear acting as a banner.","replies":[{"poster":"G Master Hung","date":"2019-08-31T04:11:20.769+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pantheon's rework inspired me to keep living.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Stripy Bag","date":"2019-08-31T02:05:14.954+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just a general good person and it would be funny to just picture a soldier lying in the mud half burnt,covered in blood,3 arrows in their chest, and innards starting to hang out of them when suddenly the Inspire Champion comes by and is like \"Get up you can still fight and be victorious.\" meanwhile your sorry ass is dying on the ground hearing this like \"Okay.\" suddenly shows you help leading the charge to take a raider outpost while still f#@ked up.","replies":[{"poster":"Lapis","date":"2019-08-31T02:10:12.921+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=The Stripy Bag,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=4KJsmAHW,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2019-08-31T02:05:14.954+0000)\n>\n> Just a general good person and it would be funny to just picture a soldier lying in the mud half burnt,covered in blood,3 arrows in their chest, and innards starting to hang out of them when suddenly the Inspire Champion comes by and is like \"Get up you can still fight and be victorious.\" meanwhile your sorry ass is dying on the ground hearing this like \"Okay.\" suddenly shows you help leading the charge to take a raider outpost while still f#@ked up.\n\nSo like this?\nhttps://prnt.sc/ozvj6r\nHonestly I dig Tianna Crownsguard as a champion","replies":[{"poster":"The Stripy Bag","date":"2019-08-31T02:20:39.921+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lapis,realm=OCE,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=4KJsmAHW,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2019-08-31T02:10:12.921+0000)\n>\n> So like this?\n> https://prnt.sc/ozvj6r\n> Honestly I dig Tianna Crownsguard as a champion\n\nYeah except maybe for the whole group they are leading and again make them Noxian so we can get the Noxian Support people have been asking for and it fits with the style of the Noxian champions since most if not all of them have something for when they get either kills,enemies low,or when they get low.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"CasterGilgamesh","date":"2019-08-31T04:19:21.897+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"every utilty sup gets nerfed down to the ground and an inspiring champ sounds like a support","replies":[{"poster":"The Stripy Bag","date":"2019-08-31T06:03:42.630+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=CasterGilgamesh,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=4KJsmAHW,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2019-08-31T04:19:21.897+0000)\n>\n> every utilty sup gets nerfed down to the ground and an inspiring champ sounds like a support\n\nI could be my usual smart ass self and say things but I really want this thread to get good attention. Yes it would most likely be a support champion but I'd like to try and keep them away from more traditional support routes. Hel I thought of maybe they should also have some kind of promote ability like the old Banner of Command except maybe the minion follows you around in combat. \"Cannon shoot em in the spine!\" Poomf! \"Ah my spine!\"","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"The Stripy Bag","date":"2019-08-31T02:56:01.680+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I suppose what got me thinking like this was partly because Gangplank's old E was he would give an AD buff to all his allies around him and a compilation of various things I've seen on the boards over the years.

I think the most we can expect in this vein going forward is short-duration, flashy buffs with little in the way of actual stats, like Kayle's heal or Yuumi. J4 will probably get reworked one of these days, and that'll be the end of his \"invisible power\" Standard.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Nekorus","date":"2019-08-31T02:32:06.456+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i mean karma was supposed to be a inspire champion hell its even the name of her shield but she dosent really show that quite well.","replies":[{"poster":"The Stripy Bag","date":"2019-08-31T02:46:58.388+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Nekorus,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=4KJsmAHW,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2019-08-31T02:32:06.456+0000)\n>\n> i mean karma was supposed to be a inspire champion hell its even the name of her shield but she dosent really show that quite well.\n\nYeah I feel like that's one of those moments of disparity between Gameplay and Story. Like yeah this person is supposed to inspire others but they don't show it well in game since at most it comes in maybe the form of a shield or heal. MTG kind of nails it with Ajani since all his abilities focus on giving counters to your creatures and other planes walkers to make them stonger while also typically having a heal or some kind of ability to summon reinforcements.","replies":[]}]}]}
