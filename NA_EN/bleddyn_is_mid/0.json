As you continue to win more solo matches, your emblem will automatically be changed to the solo emblem.  We also have a [Ranked Emblem](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209346066-Ranked-Emblems) guide that may provide additional information on this.  I hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
