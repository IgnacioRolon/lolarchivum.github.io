I was wondering if anyone else is having this issue or if there is any way to increase my fps again. Just checked to see if CS:GO, Fallout 4, and several other games were running normally to see if it was my PC, but they are all running highest with a 60 fps cap.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-29T01:51:43.147+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Some of the patch files might not be working correctly with your current drivers, or it's possible that the files just didn't update entirely correctly. Let's make sure to check for driver updates first, and if that doesn't seem to help go through the other steps in the [**FPS guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting) too. \n\nWhile you're at it, double check that the Xbox Game DVR is still turned off, since that causes a few fps issues too.","replies":[{"poster":"WsaWeds","date":"2017-09-29T02:50:58.407+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I thought I had updated my drivers, turns out the update from 3 updates ago was unsuccessful and it stopped automatically updating my PC periodically.
