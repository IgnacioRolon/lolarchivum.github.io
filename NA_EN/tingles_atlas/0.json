What do I have to do to get it back? I'm really confused about all this so any help would be much appreciated{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-11T02:34:34.625+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It doesn't take a set amount of honors or games played, but you just need to keep playing games while staying honorable. Keep in mind that any kind of behavior that could warrant punishments could make it harder to climb back up.","replies":[]}]}
