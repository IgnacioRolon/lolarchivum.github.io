Can we EITHER give Teemo more AA range, or buff his damage?","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":5,"down_votes":20,"body":"Right now, EVEN AFTER ALL the reworks, he&#039;s still conflicted in his role. He has only one use right now - to annoy the enemy team.\r\n\r\nIs he a marksman? Nope - too short a range\r\nIs he a mage? Nope, not enough upfront damage, nor any reliable cc.\r\nCan he top as a fighter? LOL, not really. Everyone can beat him save a few niche picks.\r\nAssassin? Nope, not enough damage, no escapes.\r\nSupport? Nope. Unless you WANT to lose...\r\nJungle? Nope, he cant clear efficiently nor gank. \r\nHe doesn&#039;t do ANY role effectively.\r\n\r\nWhy can he not get proper buffs? Is it his E? \r\nCause if his poison tick is whats preventing any buffs his way, EITHER just change his whole kit OR buff his E damage. You cannot have the best of both nerfs - deals no damage AND has a weak kit. NO! That is UNFAIR!\r\nI don&#039;t mind getting a completely reworked champion (even ready to give up his R), if it means I can play {{champion:17}}  in some role, effectively. Honestly you guys have tried preserving his kit and balancing him, but you just keep nerfing him. Just change his kit already!\r\nAND DONT CALL HIM MARKSMAN! He cannot play that role, and you all know it.\r\n\r\nHe&#039;s a scout right? So give him scouting abilities, give him some CC, give him supporting abilities, give him stealth on his move quick....\r\nYou can do so many things, but please change his current gimmicky condition.\r\n\r\nHe was the first champion I played all the way back in season 1. That was when everyone was getting used to MOBA&#039;s. Now he&#039;s just weak and pointless.\r\nPlease fix my favorite champion!\r\n\r\nWhat does everyone else think?","replies":[{"poster":"CreationFlaw","date":"2015-11-19T21:05:38.553+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"MAGIC DAMAGE: 60 / 110 / 160 / 210 / 260 (+ 60% AP) (+ 100% Bonus AD)\n\nMassive mate.

His weapon is a blowgun. It's not going to have range like a bow (Ashe/Varus), a gun (Caitlyn/Graves/Corki), or a crossbow (Quinn/Twitch).\n\nAs far as his damage, I would buff his base damage on W, not anything on Q or the AP scaling on W. That would make attack speed more useful on him, which turns him from AP trap placing Teemo (that's instagibbed by Oracle Alteration) into AP/AS Teemo who builds like Kayle.","replies":[{"poster":"Adormas","date":"2015-11-19T20:23:29.979+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"It may be fine thematically (blowgun and all), but it puts him in harms way from 90% of the champs in LoL.\n\nAlso buffing E (I'm guessing you meant Toxic Shot (E) and not Move Quick (W)) would work fine if he had a kit to support such a build (on hit effect).\nKayle's kit is meant for on-hit because she has both ap and ad scalings, massive ratios on her Q, a very strong heal, and an ulti that negates damage for 2 entire seconds (at lvl 1 ultimate, mind you).\nIf I had a dollar for every time I'd have lived and gotten a kill if I had had Kayles ult as Teemo, I'd be filthy rich.\nIn short, you cannot compare the two champs.\n\nThe bottom line is, his skills are just strange.
