Riot, why do you only give me the option to \"understand\" when I get a chat restriction? Why am I not allowed to dispute or disagree with you. I mean, if there is only one option, and it's to say \"I UNDERSTAND,\" then why even have it there in the first place? I mean, it doesn't mean a damn thing. You click the only option available in order to proceed. If there isn't a choice then there shouldn't be request to make one. I can click the button all you want, but that doesn't mean I agree with you. Furthermore, your restrictions are loose af. I have gotten several chat restrictions for not insulting people, not swearing, not telling people to go kys such as so common in your game, not showing any evidence of hate whatsoever and still your sensitive robot feelings deem I am being more hurtful than the troll i'm telling is \"garbage.\" How \"garbage\" is a problem is beyond me. If your sole goal is to restrict freedom of speech then just don't allow communication in your game. If people are so sensitive that when they lash out at others they can't accept the slightest of criticism for their trollness, then you shouldn't even allow players to talk unless they are in a party. Get a hold of your game and control the community and stop trolling your loyal players, please.","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2020-02-16T06:59:17.285+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":2,"body":"If you don't \"understand\" - meaning, confirm that you agree to the terms and conditions of using the software - then you should remove the program from your computer.\n\n\\> \"not insulting people\"\n\\> \"garbage\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"NF Remilia","date":"2020-02-16T07:10:28.819+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":2,"body":"If you don't agree with the ToS you should uninstall the game instead.\nSame here, you agreed with ToS thats why your only option is to say \" i understand \" if you dont want to agree , you are free to delete LoL.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2020-02-16T07:06:44.262+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"Chatlogs, let us understand for you. \n\nsounds like you are just incredibly rude and obnoxious and dont want to admit that.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GatekeeperTDS","date":"2020-02-16T13:06:00.221+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Because the rules are the rules, they're not up for negotiation.

I've known people to get banned for quoting something a toxic player said to the other team, literally saying they said it and putting it in quotes. Also seen people get banned for politely telling trolls they are being toxic, no foul language, abusiveness such as prejudicial or hate language, no insults, nothing. Just calling out someone on their behavior can earn a ban. And it's usually the trolls that started it that report the people they pissed off hoping they can bring everyone down with them. It's like Riot just wants to shut everyone up. If that's the case, take away the chat abilities and make it voice only for parties or other programs. You already took away the option to honor players on the other team. It's like you don't want sportsmanship. \n\nNot to mention, the reporting system doesn't take into account any context of the situation. There is no innocent until proven guilty. It's simply STFU community...","replies":[]},{"poster":"ElnyrJhodo","date":"2020-02-16T07:32:22.691+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":16,"body":"Likely hes not wrong.
