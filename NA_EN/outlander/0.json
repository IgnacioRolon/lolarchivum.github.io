Like I said in another comment in this thread, I don't practice as often I should, but I'm not stupid bad. I have a basic concept with most of the champs and how they should be played and not what, but it's not to the point where I feel confident enough to carry, especially if my teammates aren't doing what they're supposed to do.  Because when each of my teammates (this is an example) have 4 deaths, I have like 2, and we only have 3 kills, then I know that no matter what I do, that we won't be making a comeback. So, it isn't *all* my fault, but I do take some blame.","replies":[{"poster":"Halo","date":"2015-02-26T10:26:01.879+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"[Here is the link](http://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=Damorion215+)\nYour winrate isnt really that good with any champion.

Second, those games were towards the end of the season, where plenty of trolls and not were trying to \"catch up\" (as was I, so that was mistake by me), so you don't really know what went on in those games.  Plus, I don't practice as often as I should, like I've said before. I do still think I'm a decent player, I just have yet to find the right players to play with as well as take my time with each champion. Therefore, I can surely say that my kda will greatly improve by the middle of summer, if not til the end of the year. :o","replies":[{"poster":"Halo","date":"2015-02-27T10:26:31.028+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Thats the worst excuse i have ever heard.

Also, if you compare our average kdas on that site, you can clearly see that yours is 2.81:1 while mine is 3.42:1 as of this moment. So it confuses me when 1) you're the only one so far claiming I have a \"bad\" kda and 2) you're making this claim that mine is \"bad\" when yours is lower than mine, despite you playing ranked and me not having done so. \n\nSo you know, I'm not sorry at all for giving a legitimate reason to explain my \"bad\" kda. If you think it's \"bad\", then I can't help you there. I don't play as much as you nor do we play the same champs the same amount of times, so you're bound to have a greater kda than me on some champs. But that really gives you no right to come on here and belittle me, making it seem like it's **all** my fault (starting from your most recent reply).\n\nI will say it once more; I know I am at some fault for my kda, by not practicing as much as I should and not taking my time with each champ. I know I've made mistakes in games, like being somewhere where I shouldn't have been or perhaps putting a ward in a better brush than the one I had put in.  But that doesn't remove the fact everyone in the game will have some sort of effect on each other's kdas depending on what they do in that game.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Halo","date":"2015-02-25T11:17:46.515+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was in silver V (doesnt say on any site cuz i got there after the rewards were handed out), won 5/10 matches and got to bronze 1.

Why should I try to carry them if all they do is fuck around, make it look like they're listening to me, and then back off, getting me killed as soon as I try to run? There are games that depend on whether my skill will be good enough or not or if I can trust my teammates. And seeing as how I can't trust my teammates most of the time, then I just don't expect to carry anyone, especially if I start to fall behind.
