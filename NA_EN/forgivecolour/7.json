Look, I respect the fact you don't like windman, but if you seriously need to get those ideas out of your head and you clearly have 0 idea of how broken aatrox already is and would be if he untargetable. \n\nFirst off, making Aatrox untargetable during his Q is basically giving him a mini malphite ult on a ~14 seconds cooldown. That. is. not. a.fucking. good. idea. It's retarded as shit and forces you to nuke other parts of his kit because of this. It's directly removing counterplay. A good change would to make it more rewarding to land, or increase the animation speed so a mordekaiser on 500 pings can't dodge it without any problems. \n\nSecond off, with old sion's ult, it makes aatroxes towerdives even stronger than before for no reason and makes it impossible to stop him in a 1v1 without CC. It's simply not a good idea and doesn't fit his theme. Aatrox didn't heal people, he inspired them to go ham.","replies":[{"poster":"Dextix LT","date":"2016-10-22T08:27:24.733+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"How broken aatrox is? HE IS CRAP! He is utter trash because of a hard to balance kit that has to be reworked.\n\nYou dont need to necessaraly make him untargetable, but maybe at least immune to cc for that duration, or at least make it not interruptable. Considering that Riot is alright with the idea of fizz troll pole, this should not be such a bad idea either.\n\nAnd again, aatrox towerdives? Does anyone play him anymore? I play him on jungle sometimes, and believe me, he is not good. Even on lane, especially in current meta, he is not good. For you to even think about a towerdive, you have to snowball hard. It would at least make aatrox threathening, because currently, he is not in any way a consideration for the enemy team unless fed (Which applies to every champ).\n\nMaybe not direct Sions ult, but someting simmilar, maybe again, like you said, involving giving the team damage. Its just that, until his rework comes (Like 5 years after) he will be kept shit, and i dont like that, i would like Riot to at least try to balance him and to make him better and not keep him at trash level for 5 years.","replies":[{"poster":"GULAG 4 U","date":"2016-10-22T13:59:38.888+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Look, I don't like the fact they dumpster'd aatrox neither. But peple need to realize that aatrox's playstyle is all around revolving statcheck and unless aatrox's heal is no longer useful in a 1v1 there is simply no way riot can buff the other parts of his kit without nuking his Q/E/R. His passive is a problem too, it isn't very useful on him (And makes his entire kit clunky af and base stats talon levels of low to compensate).","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Jasiwel","date":"2016-10-21T21:13:24.184+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a once main and Mastery 7 player, his Q is the worst part of his kit and ruins his play because of how unforgiving it can be. The epicenter is too small for the knockup and it's extremely easy to miss given how much mobility has evolved since his release. That being said, Untargetability during Dark Flight would be stupid as all hell. \n\nHis Q simply needs a duration where it can't be displaced, mostly when he's winding up at the peak of the animation. Any form of displacement ruins the ability so much, mostly because of the long wind-up and that Aatrox is a seriously outdated champion compared to other Divers/Bruisers. You can make mistakes more often with others, but if you screw up Aatrox's Q, you lose whatever fight you were going to initiate/disengage. \n\nAnd Sion's old ultimate was dumped for being an unhealthy mechanic (an AURA mechanic, to say the least). It's a lazy suggestion and it drives me insane when I see people casually upvote it because they won't come up with anything better.","replies":[{"poster":"RocketRelm","date":"2016-10-21T22:59:28.283+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I remember a while ago when   Not Dominion   was up there was an Aatrox on the enemy team.
