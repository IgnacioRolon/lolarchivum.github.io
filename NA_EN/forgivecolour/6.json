A good Kat is going to be patiently waiting and poking with Q before engaging, making sure that whoever of the carries has available CC up is the first to die.\n\nFor example; \nOrianna throws out shockwave in the midst of the team fight - there goes her CC.\nMorgana dark binding already out and on CD.\nADC probably has some form of CC (ashe ulti, jinx e, varus ulti, etc) - naturally you target them, in this particular scenario it's because you're eliminating potentially deadly CC before switching to the other squishies.\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2015-03-09T20:20:15.295+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So, what you're saying is that CC isn't her enemy because all you have to do is not be stupid and wait a couple seconds before you go in for a pentakill... Like, really. lol. All squishy champions get hit by CC and get nuked, though unless it's a hard CC, it actually doesn't stop Kat, simply delays her. Roots like Morg's Q and such, you can just press Zhonya's when they try to dogpile you, letting your team dogpile them. I mean, you can't use 'Just hit her with CC and she dies' because even other champions are designed and balanced around what they do, not based on if they get hit with CC and explode because let's face it, Kog and Varus would've been buffed dramatically if they were balanced the same way you're saying Kat is to be balanced by. They get hit with CC and blow up, so they can have large bases and ratios... However, they're usually mana-gated and CD gated. Kat has no mana and her CD's are pretty short considering she's manaless and has good ratios and bases. \n\nAll in all, you contradicted yourself and balancing around 'Gets CC'd and dies' is more of an excuse to give buffs to champs that need to be rebalanced to have some counterplay outside of laning phase. Every champion is gated by SOMETHING out of lane whether it be cool downs or mana and Kata doesn't have to worry about either of these. Even LB, another top ban right now, is mana-gated.","replies":[{"poster":"MrPerson10","date":"2015-03-09T20:25:04.439+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"All-in-all, you're blind.\nI specified hard CC twice, further amplified that specification when I brought up Morg's Q and Orianna's shockwave.\nTry that again.\n\nOn your LB note, LB is also one of the few assassins with a strong early laning phase - Katarina on the other hand, has the weakest in the game which she makes up for by having a strong cleanup.","replies":[{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2015-03-10T00:59:46.168+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're obviously blind or a god awful Katarina. CC doesn't stop a Katarina. It can delay her for the length of the CC, but by no means does it ever stop her. She can unload all three abilities and do at least 2-3 ticks of her R, which does quite a lot mind you, before any CC hits her. If she's caught out BEFORE she's able to do things, that would be the same as ANY champion getting CAUGHT out before they're able to do things. \n\nThe average reaction time for even competitive players that aren't Faker is at least a second. In a second, a Katarina can Q+E+W+R. Her Q has a .6 ratio in total, W has a .25, E has a .4, and her R does .25 EVERY .25s and DOES DAMAGE WHEN PRESSED. This means in a second, a good Katarina will have all of the first three abilities tossed and used, totaling 1.25 PLUS a full second of her ulti, which is another 1.25, totaling 2.5x her AP, not including bases and penetrations. A standard Kat with two items, just a Rabadons and a Void Staff will have 400 AP. That's a base of 1200 damage from just her ratios, plus the bases, plus the penetrations... and when you do that on a squishy target like an ADC who maxes at around 1.8k health at level 18..? \n\nSeriously... Katarina is fully capable of unleashing a LOT of near unavoidable damage because of how quickly she can unleash. Her only travel time is her Q and any of her abilities, including her R, can proc it. Unless the enemies have a lot of INSTANT CC like an Syndra E, Thresh E, Lissandra R, Malz R, and the like which have no travel time and can be used at a moment's notice without failing and are used on some one highly skilled, she's going to get off a huge amount of burst. In the time a Fizz would press W and Q back in the day and do about 1.75x AP, a Kat can Q+W+E+R since there's no such thing as a 'global cool down' and her abilities have no cast time, so they flow in perfect sync.","replies":[{"poster":"MrPerson10","date":"2015-03-10T01:09:19.962+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've made it to the Plat I - Diamond V promos twice using only Katarina, pretty sure I understand her far more than you do. \n\nHer range is trash, and I mean absolute trash - the longest is a whole 700 units, which is her shunpo. A reposition which is getting its damage taken away and reduces 15% incoming damage for 1.5 seconds, next being her 675 range Bouncing Blade, 550 ult and 375 W\n\nWhat does trash range give you? Extreme predictability.\n\nA good Morgana is going to Q right where your target is about to be - the closest carry to you 9/10 times since you're not going to flash engage on 5 enemies that aren't all 1-2 hitters. How hard is it to Q to a carry as soon as you see Katarina's Q animation go out? Absolutely not hard at all.\n\nEdit: let's not forget how much point and click CC there is in the game - particularly from {{champion:127}} {{champion:31}} {{champion:80}} etc etc - these are just 3 common picks I'm using as an example.\n","replies":[{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2015-03-10T02:26:51.893+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pantheon has a wind up with his W and isn't exactly going to be in the backline trying to help peel for his carries. It would be a large waste of his potential as an initiator and one of the best backline destroyers. Cho isn't necessarily a popular pick though...  He has a 7.7% in Gold and above, 6.9% overall pick rate. He's in the top 46 most picked champs, but... that's 45 other champs more popularly picked. \n\nLissandra is a popular pick, also a popular ban due to her high amount of CC and she is a direct counter to Katarina as well as any Assassin really since she removes their ability to Assassinate with slows, a stun, and a root. Her entire kit is pretty scary for assassins, so she's a logical counter, just like she's a logical counter to Zed, LeBlanc, and really anyone who throws out a combo to burst one person down. Due to her kit being very anti-assassin as a whole, you could use that logic to say no assassin would ever need a nerf because Lissandra exists.\n\nOther picks that can counter Kat are Ahri, also a popular pick, but if she charms, she's no longer a threat to Kat. Fiddle, but he dives into your team so you can dive their backline in the mean time. Alistar, but he's not only uncommon, but he's on very large cool downs, having about 10 seconds. Lulu is a good choice, as she is against all Assassins. Soraka if she's not the main target to begin with and instagibbing due to innate squishiness. Kassadin if he's ever picked anymore, having a lower pick rate than Zac. \n\nI mean, there's lots of insta-CC's, but most are on very large cool downs and there's very few that are actually a direct counter to a Katarina and most of them are who gets to face her in lane, which is the problem right there. If that person is taken out of the fight early or has to use their CC early or not on Kat, then they've now failed their job in countering Katarina. \n\n\nThere's very little counter play to Katarina. When a champion is labeled as 'Beat them in lane and GG' or 'You need instant, hard CC' and is balanced around ONLY that, that's not balancing. If your mid has to pick before Kat and doesn't choose Lissandra, Cho, Ahri, or LB, they're in for one hell of a laning phase because Kat can escape from nearly any gank if she just uses the laning phase to farm much like a Jax and Irelia would. Bad early games are hardly an excuse for giving some one a nasty late game. We've seen that problem with Ryze who got gutted to the core while trying to fix itemization with his kit. We saw this with Veigar who had to have his reliability nerfed, which went overboard. We saw this with so many champions.","replies":[{"poster":"MrPerson10","date":"2015-03-10T02:29:20.722+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I didn't even read it more than just the first line of each paragraph cause I'm not feeling the text wall thing.\n\nI never said she was easy to counterplay into, but those who are highly skilled know how to do so properly - and understand when a Kat comp is being picked, and pick appropriately to counter that with hard, point and click CC.\n\nTo add to this, I did read the bit about Ahri - she's a pain but not a real counter, just a difficult lane. You have to be used to Shunpo'ing close to but not on top of her, far enough away that you can effectively sidestep an incoming charm but close enough that your initial e/w combo still hits.","replies":[{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2015-03-10T20:30:52.193+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Counterplay has to be apparent. You shouldn't have to base your entire team to be a counter to one champion. No one champion requires the ENTIRE enemy team to pick champions against them.  There's ones like Yi who do require more than one CC, but it doesn't have to be a point and click and an Exhaust does the trick just fine. Kat on the other hand, you can exhaust her, but what AP doesn't get a Zhonya's for moments like that? \n\nThere's just so little counterplay to Kat because she has no cast times, no delays, no mana, and her cool downs aren't even that long when compared to other champions. Her reliability is through the roof. The only time she doesn't carry is if the ENTIRE team picks and builds against her with MR and point and click CC's, early Lockets, and constantly playing passive any time she isn't in lane because her burst is pure AoE, so bot lane is an easy double kill if they've got half health, which isn't uncommon. \n\nAnd for Ahri, yeah. You bait out the Charm. A good Ahri won't charm until Kat makes a move though unless they know for suuuuure they can get the kill. Annoying lane, not much of a counter, but it's near impossible to kill the Ahri if they're not being overly aggressive and farming properly.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"LaowPing","date":"2015-03-09T21:48:40.554+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The thing that hurts kat is that she has to maintain her ult in order to deal real damage.

It gives her more occasions to proc her Q and to come back somewhat safely.\n\nBecause of the remade E, we might end up seeing more AD on Katarina players since she will be able to land a few AA before E'ing back.
