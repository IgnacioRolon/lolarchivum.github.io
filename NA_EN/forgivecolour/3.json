I tanked 800 true damage for her and was healed 1200 by the end of the game; she survived multiple engagements she would have otherwise died. Knights vow is strong, but it used to be VERY niche. \nIts suffering from the same problem that rylais did.... It used to be a situational item for a handful of champions, but after the nerfs to its competetors it became core on EVERYONE due to it suddenly being -stat wise - one of the best of its type.","replies":[{"poster":"FireDrizzle","date":"2017-06-22T23:28:56.419+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the item was underrated and the cdr was an unneeded buff.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Paroe","date":"2017-06-22T23:09:05.483+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> &amp;quot;Adc can 1v5 after bork&amp;quot;  \n\n Hyperbole, but depending on the comp and specific champion it can be true. A vayne wth botrk by 7 minutes can 1v5 pretty easy. especially if the enemy comp has no tanks.\n\n> &amp;quot;Junglers doesnt control the pace of the game anymore&amp;quot;  \n\n They dont. The pace of the game is focused on the botlane and marksman, which is why the meta has evolved into a perpetual \"protect the carry\" comp and why marksman have access to the highest damage reduction in the game.\n\n> &amp;quot;Draven is broken so Zac is balanced&amp;quot;  \n\nDraven is broken because, due to itemization, hes become a low-skill floor, immortal snowballer with no counterplay except for disengage and anti-snowball botlanes. Zac is annoying asf though.\n\n> &amp;quot;Triple lifesteal item adc is viable&amp;quot;\n\n{{item:3031}} {{item:3006}} {{item:3153}} {{item:3085}} {{item:3072}} {{item:3812}}. Yeah, its viable. IE/zerkers/hurricane is the marksman core for a reason. \n\n> &amp;quot;Adc themselves are safer than mage&amp;quot;\n\nDepends on the marksman. Most marksman are actually more mobile than non-assassin/diver mages AND contain some form of CC. The mobility combined with their itemization combined with their CC is what makes them safer than standard mages. \nMarksman, with their current itemization, have a higher burst than SYNDRA with 700AP. Burst in this sense is the damage _i_ put out with a 100% crit build in three seconds (the amount of time it takes most mages to unload their entire rotation due to cast times. Not every champion is like ahri or riven and doesnt have cast times).","replies":[{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2017-06-23T00:03:32.921+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Invest 10,600 G on lifesteal\nEnemy counters it by investing 900 G on {{item:3123}}","replies":[{"poster":"Paroe","date":"2017-06-23T00:12:00.513+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Limmie,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=MRbcMFsg,comment-id=00030002,timestamp=2017-06-23T00:03:32.921+0000)\n>\n> Invest 10,600 G on lifesteal\n> Enemy counters it by investing 900 G on {{item:3123}}\n\nAnd yet, so few people buy it. \nIve seen masters players stick to the doctrine, and not diverge from the path despite losing.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ForgiveColour","date":"2017-06-22T23:12:30.766+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"That build is pure garbage lmaoooo nice alternative facts in your post","replies":[]},{"poster":"Terozu","date":"2017-06-22T23:54:42.370+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's my main build on Jinx, with DD swapped for RFC, and ayah, with Greaves swapped for PD(the passive plus her W means boots are kind of unnessecary) and Runaans swapped for RFC.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Marshbouy","date":"2017-06-22T22:49:11.879+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I blame MM's post about how playing a tank is **really difficult**","replies":[{"poster":"ForgiveColour","date":"2017-06-22T22:50:54.527+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its funny how i made a thread using his logic and saying every class takes game knowledge to play well and was downvoted LUL","replies":[{"poster":"Rewt","date":"2017-06-22T23:05:30.138+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"game knowledge and mechanical skill are two vastly different things.
