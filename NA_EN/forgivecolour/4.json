That has nothing to do with upcoming patches, Kass has no upcoming buffs. And his rates are still garbage. Its certainly a step up but he needs more. Either more damage (maybe an AP ratio on his ult) or better defensive stats so he can be a bruiser.\n\n> As a Kat main, her squishiness and early immobility due to lack of resets is one of her biggest downfalls.

Now she actually might be able to be harassed down with her 4-5 pot start. Shutting her down and keeping her there is a lot more possible now. But it doesn't make up for the massive power spike from Ludens release.\n\nAnd you don't need to have your resets to be mobile.
