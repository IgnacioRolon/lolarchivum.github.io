Morgana is pretty immobile and predictable too, so she's definitely not up there with hardest champion to gank.

If you're anticipating it, it is easy to dodge. She has a black shield, but she's so squishy, that doesn't even matter. if she misses her bind, in most cases, she's dead in a solo lane.","replies":[]},{"poster":"darkdill","date":"2015-03-04T01:26:06.188+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think you have ganking confused with tower-diving.

She may not be the best pick for it but I wouldn't say she's a bad one.  There is also nothing better than watching a Lee Sin pull all his dashy non-sense just to ult a black shield and look silly sitting in a binding as you calmly walk past him.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ActuallyArrow","date":"2015-03-04T18:53:38.297+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Skuttle is too OP too. \nRiot, nerf Skuttle.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sooko","date":"2015-03-04T18:29:21.871+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Morgana is ungankable in every lane.
