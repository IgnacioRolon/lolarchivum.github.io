The others have a bit more risk:\n\nLiss has to use E for mobility or for damage, not easily for both, and it has a long cooldown anyway.\nKat has to have a unit to blink to, either allied or enemy (or ward, but I think I speak for many people when I say just get rid of ward hopping). She also has a cooldown on her blink unless she gets a kill. Usually she uses it to go in, so if you stop her from getting a kill, she's stuck.\nFizz was nerfed to the point where he no longer passively shreds low-HP enemies and his damage is loaded into his ult landing. I think he's fine now. His E is frustrating but no more so than Vlad's -- it also is his biggest source of flat damage and costs a ton of mana so if he uses it to escape, he's held back a lot of damage.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zydin","date":"2015-02-22T23:24:33.970+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:105}}  A lot of his damage comes from landing is ult now.. he misses it he losses out on a lot of damage. \n\n{{champion:38}} Very mobile but that mobility isn't free the mana cost increases the more frequently he uses it.\n\n{{champion:55}} Has to use all her spells and can only get out with flash or if she gets a kill\n\n{{champion:127}}  If she does in with her E then she has no escape except flash.\n\n{{champion:103}} Very mobile yes. Not sure where the risk really comes from.\n\n{{champion:7}}   Adding a delay to how fast she can activate the return on her W and between when she is able to activate her ult after using another skill would make it a little more balanced so she can't full combo a person and get out in less then a second.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Meep Man","date":"2015-02-22T19:35:55.425+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You cant do anything if you constantly play safe. If the Zed wastes his ultimate on you just to teleport back, he is extremely weak and unable to assassinate anyone for a good while unless you were low on health, upon which anyone can kill you.
