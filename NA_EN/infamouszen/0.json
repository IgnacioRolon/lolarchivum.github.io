Did you try clicking on the spell instead of using the q hotkey?  It could be the assignment that bugged up.  Make sure when you start the game too, that you run as administrator, otherwise hotkey use is iffy.  You're not giving too many details here so it's hard to say for sure, especially if it's not a recurring issue.  I've never run into this myself.\n\n-ChrisB5\n{{champion:89}} {{champion:19}}","replies":[{"poster":"InfamousZen","date":"2014-11-15T18:54:27.105+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I tried doing that, but didn't do anything.

I really don't have much detail to give because I was using my Q and got a spike and when the spike passed after a few seconds it just stopped working.","replies":[]}]}]}
