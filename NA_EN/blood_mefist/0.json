I have a theory that the type of Drake someone likes tells you a lot about them as a player.\n\nPeople that like Infernal are probably the ones that like to fight a lot. They are the ones that you will likely find chasing a 2 hp Amumu all the way across the map instead of taking a tower or pushing a lane. They are probably the ones who's solution to every problem is to group and fight.\n\nPeople like me who love to split-push every chance they get like Mountain Drake. Players like me absolutely hate the idea of grouping constantly for no reason and would rather spend half the game ignoring their team while constantly pushing one lane. We don't care much about our KDA's so long as we are getting towers. We are the kind of players that think a death for a tower or an inhibitor is a good trade.\n\nPeople that like Cloud drake probably main champs like Shaco or other assassins like Leblanc and Akali and love to roam about getting picks. Players like this never like to farm and they tend to roam from lane every chance they get even if it means only having 20 CS by 10 minutes. These players primary source of income is kills and they tend to have high KDAs or they feed a lot. Yasuo mains might like this Drake too.\n\nPeople who love to spam abilities a lot might like Ocean Drake. Ziggs mains, Lux mains, Sona mains come to mind.","replies":[{"poster":"Venomar","date":"2016-12-14T16:34:01.517+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"Terrible assertions tbh","replies":[{"poster":"FioraWillCarry","date":"2016-12-14T16:35:06.508+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Venomar,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=754xKhqx,comment-id=00080000000000010000,timestamp=2016-12-14T16:34:01.517+0000)\n>\n> Terrible assertions tbh\n\nI love speculating on shit like this.
