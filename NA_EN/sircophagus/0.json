There might just be a couple files corrupted somewhere that just aren't working with DirectX properly, so let's try this first. Test it in a custom/practice game first to avoid any possible leaverbusters from crashing in a normal match. \n\nIf that repair doesn't help at all, go ahead and hit up our tech guys in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new). It sounds like you've already done plenty of troubleshooting, so in that case, let's get you a little better help!","replies":[]},{"poster":"SirCophagus","date":"2017-10-15T16:51:06.922+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, it is a little annoying. Granted it started when I was going into a practice tool mode where I was trying things out, so I didn't get a reported. But I can't play anything.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lawful Good","date":"2017-10-15T16:42:53.370+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've had the same issue. It even hit me with a leaver buster after I loaded back into the client. This is really something that we should be notified of before we get into a game if they're going to punish us for sudden updates.","replies":[]}]}
