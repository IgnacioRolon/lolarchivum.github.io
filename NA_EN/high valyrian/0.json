The graphic most likely will be on the top right corner (where events and quest appears) How many times do you check that specific part of the screen? \n\nYou could just give a red admiration mark on top of the player.

I guess a minuscule disadvantage can be overcome with a bit more to be aware of;  I am worried about later champions being released with those kinds of telegraphing functions, however.  These are relatively new champions here, and I'm assuming Riot is trying to use sound effects to balance out abilities with near global influence more.  It's just something I figured Riot and the community should be aware of","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Betty le Boop","date":"2015-02-07T19:45:28.006+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay, I'll have to say it this way because of the fact I've been around and known many hearing challenged people. Yes, it's nice to think we can do it for the hearing impaired, but it would make the natural hearing have an extra advantage also. Hearing impaired people have to compensate for everyday life, whether or not we realize it. They make innovations for themselves. They compensate. Some play with hearing people so they can gives cue's for the ult sounds. Like f = fiddle ult s = sion ult r= reksai ult ect. Hearing impaired move on in their own stride, and do not like to think of themselves as impaired. Do not make a special game mode just for that. \n\nHowever, having CC (closed caption) as an option is a good concept. It's the only thing for people who are hearing impaired that I and probably they, would accept. It also has noises included. *Crows* *Clang* *Screeching* That would be nice, and far better than making changes to the entire gameplay. That way, hearing impaired and non can have the option.","replies":[]},{"poster":"YOU BEEN WARNED","date":"2015-02-06T22:48:49.419+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Most important thing is that it doesn't show where Sion is ulting from or to.

Sound is important in locating opponents, guessing their attacks, and figuring out if your abilities hit a target, so not being able to experience it at all likely creates a gameplay disadvantage. Looking at some \"just for fun\" fan videos of League of Legends, there's often some kind of dynamic text edited onto champions or abilities to illustrate the sound they're making, and the ideal would probably be to have a sort of automatic version of this that mimics the sounds and cues hearing players experience.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zeolix WYD","date":"2015-02-06T20:41:25.671+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I actually play with sound off and put my own music in the background.

Noc's Q comes to mind, where if you hit an enemy in the bush, it makes a noise, but there is otherwise no notification unless they move and spread the trail.  Unfortunately, this is not a simple undertaking.  \n\nThere's a ton of spells that have audio feedback but no visual feedback if the enemy is in fog of war.  You'd need to go through and Identify each of them to start, and with 123 champions in the game, that's a lot of stuff.  \n\nI don't know what their back end is like, but it sounds like at this point, they have a fuckton of modular building blocks, so adding the assets **should** be easy.  \n\nThe trouble is making the assets.  For every spell that needs to have visual feedback, there's design overhead to figure out what kind of feedback they want, specifically.  It'll take potentially several iterations of design and art coming up with what they want it to do and look like, as well as polishing the quality once they get it how they want it.  There's likely to be bugs generated as well, and QA time needs to be allocated for each feature added.\n\nThis is just for small things like a skillshot into a bush.  Figuring out what to do with rek sai and sion is another matter.
