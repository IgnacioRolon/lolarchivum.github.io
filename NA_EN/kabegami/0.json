I deleted config I've uninstalled I've used the hextech repair tool and nothing seems to get it to work. So I will now try to take it public to try and get more options to fix this long lived problem.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-09T01:21:42.576+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sometimes you need to take very specific steps to make sure your config file is fully reset. Do me a favor and try this out really quickly....\n\n- Log into the game client\n- Navigate to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config\n- Delete the file  named **game.cfg** and **persistedsettings.json**\n- Go into a custom game and verify that settings have saved properly. \n- Leave game to sync settings\n\nGive that a go and your config files should be manually reset, and then you should be able to get those numbers showing again.","replies":[]}]}
