I really love the skin itself but there's a problem with the sound when mini Gnar is about to tranform into MEGA Gnar. There is almost no sound compared to his other skins. The sound is a great way for the player to tell when exactly Gnar is gonna transform, since the sound is timed with his passive. But with this skin you don't have that.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time. \r\nGaffz {{champion:150}}","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-05T23:13:20.118+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ooooo thanks for the heads up! This might have something to do with certain game files possibly, so I'd suggest running a quick repair if you can. If that doesn't help, make sure you repost this over in Report a Bug where the devs can see it!","replies":[]}]}
