I recently tried to play a game and called adc when another player had called bot. He threw a fit like a literal 12 year old and proceeded to harass me to no end because he didn't specify what he was doing in bot at all. Not only that, but I had played another game where I accidentally killed a beginning buff for our jungler and he proceeded to throw a fit and even intentionally feed bot lane just to mess us up.\r\n\r\nI cannot be the only one sick and tired of bad behaviors to such this degree. If you don't make your call right or cannot forgive mistakes, what is the point of even playing. I even told my jungler to report me if he saw fit because I was upset myself for making a mistake, but instead of actually playing, he threw the match. Anyone have any idea on what to do besides reports? I want to keep playing but at this point, it doesn't even seem worth it.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-27T05:02:14.543+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Taking the higher road and reporting them rather than stooping to their level is going to be the best sure-fire way help us fix this. With reports, it alerts us to their account and anything they might have been doing. If you focus on reporting the people who are toxic or offensive instead of trying to fight back, that will also help make sure you don't get reported for fighting back as well.","replies":[{"poster":"SilverPhoenix127","date":"2017-09-29T17:20:39.816+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm doing my best to report every time, but it's really just discouraging to have to deal with way more toxic players than actual players who actually try to learn the game. Is there anyway I can see reports myself after making them?","replies":[]}]}]}
