This is the chat room tab. \n\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/JNS4AlS.png\n\nType in \"Pool Party\" and hit the magnifying glass symbol to join. It&#039;ll most likely be full. \n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/zyZ8hTu.png\n\nWhat do? Chat rooms are 200 people max, so join the next one. \"Pool Party 1\" \"Pool Party 2\" etc. As many as we need. If you&#039;re the only person in the room, just chill out and wait. More will join if the others are full.\n\n_**STEP 2**_\n\nStart a game. Don&#039;t be a nab and click solo queue. Hit the Party button. In the following menu, locate the most important button you&#039;ll see for the next 4 days.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/3YJudNM.png\n\n_**STEP 3**_\n\nClick that glorious button. It&#039;ll take you to another screen.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/wUPw0uT.png\n\nThe handy-dandy \"Chat Rooms\" tab at the bottom is a very, very dear ally for beating Rito. Click it, spam click the + signs until your 15 invites is full, then invite them. Repeat as needed, being sure to not invite the same person twice.\n\n_**STEP 4**_\n\nWhen your room finally looks like this. \n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/4RjuYqW.png\n\nHit the start button. You&#039;ve done it. Congratulations. Win or lose, you&#039;ve helped to add five points toward our fight against Rito. Win one match like this and you&#039;re eligible for the rewards. If every player who plays LoL in a month does this until they win one game, we&#039;ll rek Rito&#039;s meter and blow it ~~through the roof~~ _out of the water_. Get on it, people.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot 0xGradius","date":"2015-06-18T19:46:47.472+0000","up_votes":119,"down_votes":3,"body":"Don't tell anyone, I upvoted this ;)\n\nBut seriously, use this to make some new friends and enjoy some games together!","replies":[{"poster":"AMYS GRAVE","date":"2015-06-18T19:48:24.805+0000","up_votes":20,"down_votes":4,"body":"question: If the community doesn't reach 35 M points, then what will you do with the pool party minion assets that you guys have put so much work into creating?","replies":[{"poster":"Orbv","date":"2015-06-18T19:53:22.710+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":42,"body":"Surprise!

Any person who has read a book in the past year can tell because he starts off with an exclamation point. From that alone you can tell that his comment was said with an upbeat irony. Almost every instance where a statement starts with an exclamation is facetious or dramatic. As he did not end his statement with an ellipsis, it is obvious that he did not end on a condescending tone, more so an incomplete one.\n\nAlso, the fact that it's making fun of something, makes it a satire...so I don't even know what you think is missing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ArkenStorm","date":"2015-06-19T02:53:23.652+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"It did?
