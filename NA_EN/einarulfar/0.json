MANY high-elo streamers (you know, those people that understand the game fairly well) are still disgusted with the item. You should be ashamed if you&#039;re convinced removing 25 Health-drain-on-hit fixed this fucking item.\n\n**The Jungle & it's tuning has become a joke.** Riot had issues earlier in S7 when the Jungle was a Lv 2+ gank fiesta, but with the addition of Catchup EXP (I know, I *fully understand* the purpose of it), tweaking of camps, and overall balance changes throughout the Season - the Jungle is STILL a gank fiesta. Quoted from Nightblue3, &quot;I just need to do this first clear, and I can start going around just ganking.&quot; In which he does, repeatedly, only occasionally stopping to grab camps. **The new on-the-rise Korean Jungler** does nothing but grab a few camps, and repeatedly camp a lane *because currently, that&#039;s the best Solo-Q JG strategy to turn the game into your favor*.\n\n**The Power/Mobility creep continues**. Riot&#039;s constantly mentioning that they should buff/implement x to deal with x alongside the inclusion of certain items/features, and it&#039;s not helping the Mobility or Powercreep that continues to happen. I&#039;m disgusted with the fact that Riot said in regards to Assassin&#039;s damage, &quot;needs to not kill you in literally the blink of an eye&quot;, yet ADCs have been doing pretty much that for SEVERAL patches; not to mention they implemented Duskblade - which has a passive that allows you to ALSO pop anyone in the blink of an eye that doesn&#039;t have a shield. **To again quote NB3, &quot;Okay, I&#039;ve got my Duskblade, now I can go around killing anyone that isn&#039;t a tank&quot;** And he does. Regardless of who they&#039;re with, he gets the kill, gets out; the itemspike it offers is INSANE due to the passive.\n\n**Turrets might actually be the most pathetic I&#039;ve ever seen them.** AP applies adequate damage to turrets, Lethality applies, Herald exists; everything is slowly becoming able to shred turrets. Cool. I don&#039;t care, so long as we&#039;re compensated with adjustments to the turrets so sections of the map &amp; lane aren&#039;t effectively lost at EXTREMELY early points in the game. Saw **Imaqtpie** walking back to lane yesterday at **Level 4** and by the time he and V Nasty made it back, the enemy ADC + Support had shoved a normal melee/caster wave and taken the turret down to 15-20% health. **AT LEVEL 4**.\n\nI&#039;ve duo&#039;d on and off with a good friend of mine that has been around for Seasons before me, and I&#039;d like to quote him to end this. \n\n> It&#039;s pretty clear what Riot&#039;s doing with the game when you think of all the factors they&#039;ve changed. It&#039;s largely for the Competitive Matches they host, and while people joke about it with &quot;its for the LC$&quot;, everything is shifting in a way that generates fast + easy excitement (via heavily changing game pacing) from the viewership during their big events. Though I&#039;d be unafraid to wager that the majority of their revenue and playerbase is the masses that inhabit Solo Queue, buy skins/chromas/passes, etc; the people that play their game daily. **It&#039;s a sad reality, because Riot used to deeply care for their playerbase and the experience they offered to them, but now it feels like it&#039;s largely about the money.**","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Wav3Break","date":"2017-10-07T22:20:46.734+0000","up_votes":136,"down_votes":19,"body":"I'm sorry that your League experience hasn't been as enjoyable this year as past ones.

This is simply false. As a person who's worked on changes for the game over the past ~2 years, I've never once been asked to consider eSports revenue as a factor in my design decision making. If this was truly our goal, I'm sure you'd be hearing a lot more \"ha-sa-ki\" in the pro games you are watching. \n\nAs a designer, I value the pro-game as an expression of what optimized behavior looks like. Having an eSports scene illuminates what is powerful and what is weak to every player and helps designers understand what systems need to be re-balanced in order to achieve more variety in League's gameplay. This is both good and bad because even though it helps live players discover new strategies, it also accelerates the solving of the meta-game when something is over-tuned or lacks counter-play.\n\nIdeally, being informed by pro-play allows us to make changes that improve the holistic experience for all players over time. But balancing our timing with what's healthy for pro play has historically been very challenging. This year we tried to be more accommodating to the pro players with the degree and timing of our changes nearing Worlds. I personally feel like this was a correct decision, but it also meant we took on different risks than previous years which have manifested different costs.\n\nI also want to highlight that some opinions about the game aren't uniform at Riot. Designers argue and discuss about what the game needs every day but efforts to make change need to be balanced with features that the design team is already aligned on delivering. For example, I personally think League's pacing should be re-examined and that Duskblade should probably be re-shaped, but it's unlikely that I could work on those changes properly without seeing what the game looks like after Runes Reforged shakes things up. \n\nTo close,  I realize this post isn't very specific about particular solutions we might have in mind with the pain points you brought up, but we are most definitely examining the game with similar lenses.

It definitely hasn't; it's overall been a rough season (especially the latter half), and I'm so sad to see the Jungle in the state it's currently in. This entire season has just been one long and agonizing ride as the changes flowed in, and I kept silent for most of the season once I started personally noticing changes I wasn't fond of (but at the time, didn't deem unhealthy). Largely because Riot usually eventually gets around to correcting any glaring issues (item/champion bandaids aside; albeit fine if shortly thereafter approached with a rework IMO) But it feels like within S7 in particular, many things have just been \"set free\" to run relatively rampant, and it sucks as a player. \n\nIt sucks, and honestly feels weird to actually step away from League for the first time in 3 years because I didn't feel comfortable with what it was. My experience only stems from Early S5, so I can't speak for Riot's approach prior. And I understand things change; I'm holding out for Season 8 though in hopes it'll hold a shining beacon of hope within it at some point. Your post alone gives me some hope tbh, because it can often feel like the players aren't heard; and from what you say, it sounds like internally Riot sees the mess within the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Sp33d Zer0","date":"2017-10-07T23:22:38.763+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":3,"body":"It's funny because I have bad the opposite experience.

Rakan and Thresh are absolutely two whose kits shine; granted they are playmaking supports and can certainly turn the tide of things with the right decision making. That's something I love about Support; my decision-making can *heavily* impact the life of someone standing beside me during the laning phase.\n\nI'm fine with Riot trying to make Support a more attractive option; I just wish they could find a way that doesn't promote layering shields/heals; I feel like it's an unhealthy design IMO and prevents the ADC from often having to express any skillful ability to kite their opponent.

Now this game feels really stupid. I cant even play the midlaner i want if I wanted to win. Her skill ceiling was destroyed by the range nerf, damage nerf, and charm no longer stopping dash nerf. \n\nIf Riot continues to nerf skill ceiling of champ, the game just becomes really boring every game. If I want to win, I am never going to even touch Ahri unless my team carries me. Her apc damage was nerfed to the point that I cannot call her a reliable ap damage source. Her damage for late game was gutted and so was her survivability with the range nerf. \n\nThe movement speed Q addition just ruined Ahri for me. I really liked her passive early playstyle and become hyper carry lategame. She still had potential to 1v1 against most matchup due to having good enough damage to outplay. Ahri could have 1v1 akali, zed, and many champs before because her kit was full of outplay mechanics. Now some matchups became impossible to win since she lacks so much damage compared to before and some skill ceiling aspect of her(charm stopping dashes) was removed. \n\nI am supposed to play her as a mage but her cool downs are way too long to call her a dps or kite mage. Even burst mage is not right since her burst is if not the weakest from all burst mage. Her aoe is trash as well. Her cc is on flat 11 sec cd and useless against champs like Master Yi who is just going to run at you full speed. \n\nThen this form of Ahri will probably stay for a very long time. If she is unhealthy she is quickly reworked but if she feels so useless, she is forced to wait or never going to be looked at. Feels really bad even if I do land charm with Ahri, banshees and qss denies Ahri's entire kit. Veigar got some nice buff for the same reason, but Ahri is forced to remain weak. \n\nEven the last nerf was not needed, but she was forced to get it anyway. Current Ahri's W, the additonal 2 hits feels really bad to even land. 30% damage of an already weak spell. Sometimes i rather have it aoe, but then the damage and range is trash on it so it doesnt help becoming an aoe spell. \n\nIm waiting for Ahris winrate to drop even further so that Riot may possibly look at her. It is kinda sad that i want my main to be nerfed to have Riot to look at her, but I guess that may never happen.","replies":[{"poster":"DorkunedAuras","date":"2017-10-08T00:58:23.811+0000","up_votes":21,"down_votes":0,"body":"So ignoring that she's statistically fine as a midlaner, is perfectly reasonable overall, and has no real issues atm, you are trying to change the topic of a thread because a Rioter posted.

If this was truly our goal, I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;d be hearing a lot more &quot;ha-sa-ki&quot; in the pro games you are watching. \n> \n> As a designer, I value the pro-game as an expression of what optimized behavior looks like. Having an eSports scene illuminates what is powerful and what is weak to every player and helps designers understand what systems need to be re-balanced in order to achieve more variety in League&#x27;s gameplay. This is both good and bad because even though it helps live players discover new strategies, it also accelerates the solving of the meta-game when something is over-tuned or lacks counter-play.\n> \n> Ideally, being informed by pro-play allows us to make changes that improve the holistic experience for all players over time. But balancing our timing with what&#x27;s healthy for pro play has historically been very challenging. This year we tried to be more accommodating to the pro players with the degree and timing of our changes nearing Worlds. I personally feel like this was a correct decision, but it also meant we took on different risks than previous years which have manifested different costs.\n> \n> I also want to highlight that some opinions about the game aren&#x27;t uniform at Riot. Designers argue and discuss about what the game needs every day but efforts to make change need to be balanced with features that the design team is already aligned on delivering. For example, I personally think League&#x27;s pacing should be re-examined and that Duskblade should probably be re-shaped, but it&#x27;s unlikely that I could work on those changes properly without seeing what the game looks like after Runes Reforged shakes things up. \n> \n> To close,  I realize this post isn&#x27;t very specific about particular solutions we might have in mind with the pain points you brought up, but we are most definitely examining the game with similar lenses. I&#x27;m sure all of the devs on League are striving to do better in this new season as well and I hope we can earn back your trust with the efforts you&#x27;ll see in the coming months and new year.\n\nThis deserves to be front page of everything. As a player that's played through all seasons, and has played games before where the chinese buy-out the company and turn the game into a money-grab fiesta, it's very satisfying to hear that the people actually developing the game still care and are working hard to better the game. Acknowledging when you've fucked up on a season takes a lot of balls, and it feels good as a dedicated player to hear that. I'm glad our opinions are being listened to, and i'm glad you guys are taking the right steps to make this game what the players want it to be. As a game developer myself, i know it's not always easy to balance such a large game, but communicating to your players that you're trying means the most. I hope the balance team can earn my trust back as well, because i really do love this game with a passion.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mannny","date":"2017-10-08T06:55:52.810+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why don't you just shift the gameplay to what's most optimal and best for Solo-q, and the pro players have to adjust to that? I know it seems weird, but things that excel at Solo-Q will inherently be bad in Pro play as theres more communication involved then just 1v5 carrying. Even if the gameplay shifts to Solo-Q oriented, the competitive scene will still have it's own picks and such that are more optimal for high-coordinated team play.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"THE RlVER KlNG","date":"2017-10-07T15:41:49.848+0000","up_votes":87,"down_votes":6,"body":"Good post but don't quote nightblue as evidence lol","replies":[{"poster":"BoilTheOil","date":"2017-10-07T15:54:16.133+0000","up_votes":28,"down_votes":5,"body":"I mean he is a good player","replies":[{"poster":"AirKingNeo","date":"2017-10-07T16:09:58.563+0000","up_votes":40,"down_votes":2,"body":"\"He's fine if he just cut the fucking Kappa shit\" -Someone, I think it was Qt or something?","replies":[{"poster":"Big Black Croc","date":"2017-10-07T20:08:05.959+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tyler1 said that.","replies":[{"poster":"Melledoneus","date":"2017-10-08T01:34:30.066+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why must agreeable words come from the most disagreeable of individuals?","replies":[{"poster":"AninLegions777","date":"2017-10-08T15:43:37.731+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Disagreeable because?","replies":[{"poster":"SpecterVonBaren","date":"2017-10-09T00:07:37.091+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just watch a video of him talking with other people, whenever someone says something that irks him or that even slightly riles him up he shoves his face into his camera with a really severe expression.
