If the ADC isn't surrounded by their tanks, they get picked off by an assassin. It keeps the ADC from being able to go wherever they want. Assassins become problematic when they can assassinate tanks, or when they can kill a squishy that's positioned correctly.","replies":[{"poster":"Partholonian","date":"2018-02-08T13:08:20.232+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think his point is that an ADC standing next to a friendly Taric (or whoever) is not \"out of place\".  If you catch the ADC solo greeding a side wave, it doesn't matter how much heal or peel their support could have provided, because they're NOT THERE.  *That's* the scenario assassins should excel in, not diving into the full team.\n\nOther than *maybe* a Vayne stun into a wall, I have a hard time seeing an ADC surviving that kind of 1v1 when both sides have similar level and items.  Anyone want to post some clips?\n\nAssassins are all about punishing stupidity, which can be frustrating when the enemy team refuses to play stupid, but that's why a lot of assassins can also splitpush, which improves the chances of someone trying to show up to 1v1 (not a marksman, unless they're stupidly fed or just stupid).","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"JohnnyNeverSins","date":"2018-02-07T20:49:06.503+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"When twitch is better than a fucking rengar and they nerf KALISTA AGAIN,something is fucking wrong.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shaydrox","date":"2018-02-07T11:17:44.146+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've said it many times, and I'll say it again: assassins needed some more gameplay in their burst.
