AD items get 5 or 10 extra points here and there, new champions with instantly proccable shields and untargetability keep getting added, minions start automatically pushing waves, tank items get higher armor coupled with very slow turret damage ramp up making dives occur as early as level 2 with no real consequence or precision required. Turret stats increase only with time, while games have become shorter and levels gained quicker, making them not scale as quickly as the champions or even the minions in-game.\n\nAt this point turrets are glorified caster minions that exist only to give the opposing team gold and steal CS from the automatically pushing waves.\n\nThe nexus turrets offer a small bit of potential, having regenerating health after not being attacked for long enough, but  the structures need a lot of improvements to catch up to where everything else in the game as come to.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Metleon","date":"2017-10-31T23:50:17.406+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pretty sure they did this to make assassins better at taking objectives, because they really don't bother doing anything other than killing everyone.
