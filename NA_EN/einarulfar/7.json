Right now, for many champs it is worth skipping raptors because of the damage they put out. Now, this will be one of the most important camps to take early. I think this will change a lot of the top tier junglers that you see. Champs that have early AoE will reign superior. As for the overall state of the jungle, I am warming up to it. The one thing I am most sour about is the lost of oracles from raptor, and the fact that the sight plants also let the enemy know where you are. You pay a price for vision now.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Asamas","date":"2017-01-05T15:26:39.515+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I know that now there are some broken things that the junglerers can do like instant lvl 3. I do this every game and every game i get first blood and after that i win. I don't think that this is good so nerfing the exp that the camps give you is a good idea. The plants are kinda cool and i seriously don't miss the smite rewards. This rewards was pretty stupid. The rock give you stun on AA. The wolf give you an orb. That logic. I can still the dragon with that ziggs plant and escape with the abillity of my champion. For me the jungel really can be better becouse i get the krugs only when in want my farm score to be big.  \nThe problem is that some of the tank junglerers are weaker. It feels like if they have Kha'Zix you you eill lose. \nI started talking some random things. Sorry.\nI am really positive about the exp tweaks in the next patch but i dislike that they will nerf the krugs more. In the begining they were broken(red buff+krugs=lvl3) nut now they are really weak in my opinion.I will probably take them only in the late game where i can one-shot the big krug. \nI like the new jungel. It's funnier  to play in the jungel now. There are so much things that you need to watch out for. Personally i don't recall for items. When i die for the first time in a game i have about 3000 gold. And with the new smite this is even easyer. The plants are cool but i want more. I don't know why but i want to see what they will change next. \nWith one word: I like the new S7 jungel; I think that the exp tweak will be healty; and i hope i was helpful.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jaygo41","date":"2017-01-05T14:27:50.180+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"What they need to do is create an environment that suits farmers and suits pressure junglers. Right now, the only people worth playing do both. The season 4 jungle had constant up time on jungle camps but lower xp and gold (minus conservation from spirit of the elder lizard). This resulted in more clever pathing and you could play mind games with laners and time ganks in interesting manners, but farming wasn't a bad option either and it kept you afloat.\n\nUnfortunately, right now everyone's butthole tenses at 3-3:30 in the game because of the obvious but very hard to avoid level 3 ganks. They're hard to avoid because of the level the jungler is at. Usually a laner is 2 or just turning 3 and the jungler has double buffs. Damage junglers just destroy everyone as a result\n\nWhat i wished we had back was an easier jungle and jungle champs balanced around each other rather than balancing around the jungle itself. They keep camps really tough so that tanks can't just run amok and kill everything. Then they try to make them hit hard so Evelynn doesn't run around and kill everything. Well jungle diversity is the spice of life for junglers, and I'll take the diversity that the season 4's jungle had toward the end of its time and before patch 4.20. Quill coat was out, allowing tanks to keep time with damage junglers without losing too much health. Damage junglers were still damage junglers and could counterjungle and carry but the ramifications and consequences for the opposing jungler weren't as catastrophic as they are now. As a result we saw a pretty big spread of junglers at that time. I saw Zacs, Sejuanis, Wukongs, Udyrs, Lee Sins, Vis, Evelynns, Elises, Jarvans, Kha'Zixes, Pantheons, and even wonkier stuff like Cho'Gath. I'm sure new Graves would have found his way into that jungle as well.\n\nWhen health and mana for junglers is high but xp and gold is kept low(er), Jungle has the most propensity to shine as an intellectual role. You really were more capable of outwitting the other guy rather than brute forcing with some Lee Sin lvl 6 instakill nonsense that we see now.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DJ Lucio","date":"2017-01-05T14:56:50.520+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Play a early ganker that has a good midgame-lategame\n\nYou'll just pressure and get lane kills and snowball the game","replies":[]},{"poster":"Very Hard Engage","date":"2017-01-05T13:20:33.671+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"camps are always down so you have more time to gank and impact lanes which is great. \n\nonly gripe is when you get invaded on and somethings missing it really sucks. \n\nbest advice i can give in 2017 just camp bot lane and get double kills.
