(Pikachu Kennen is the most requested, but there are some clear legal issues with that.) But if I had to decide on which Kennen skin I would want the most, it would definitely be **Storm Lord Kennen**. What it would include is new, storm-like particles (e.g. windy, almost hurricane-like, particles) and a new model that makes him look like a calamity brought upon Runeterra to destroy all in its wake. His ultimate should be changed to look like a hurricane, and wind particles to be added to his other abilities, and maybe even make his E give him a mini tornado around him, which would look even better if he ults, as he would then look like the eye(heart) of the hurricane(tempest).  As for his model, I trust you guys would know how to make it look cool, but if there is anything that should be on it it should be a Chinese straw hat, as a lot of characters associated with thunder and storms usually wear that (e.g. Raiden, Storm Spirit, and many others.) This is definitely the skin I'd want the most for my favorite ninja.\n\nSomething similar to this (the left one), but much more omnipotent/otherworldly: http://fluoxyd.deviantart.com/art/Skins-Concept-Kennen-415861966","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gryfuz","date":"2015-11-11T10:11:25.792+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"HellFire Liberator Kennen\n\nhttp://wellsinisterart.deviantart.com/art/HellFire-Liberator-Kennen-Skin-Idea-523278068","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Blainezy","date":"2015-10-14T20:08:35.810+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think something fire related would be cool for Kennen!
