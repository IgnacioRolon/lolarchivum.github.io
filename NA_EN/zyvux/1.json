This easily trumps 2nd place, being Piltover Customs Blitzcrank with 588, almost a 2 MONTH DIFFERENCE. And PC Blitz is going on sale in september , yet BC Varus isn&#039;t. What is going on here, I really reaaaaaaaaaaaally want that skin and have just enough to buy it on sale, yet for some reason it isn&#039;t going on sale within the next moonth, even though it already broke the record for longest time without a sale. Is there a reason this skin isn&#039;t going on sale, like you are updating its particles, or did you guys just forget about it?? Ty in advance.","replies":[{"poster":"WizardCrab","date":"2015-08-19T00:42:29.704+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Whoops. Sorry about that.
