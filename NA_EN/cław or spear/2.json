I went in to a custom and started to stream, I instantly received 700-800 ms but the second I stopped streaming it went back down to its usual 44 ms. Is there anything I can do that allows me stream without lagging or is my PC/Internet too bad and I can't stream without having insane amounts of Ping? Thanks","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-22T03:28:21.383+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeeeaaaa it just sounds like the stream is eating up all of your bandwidth since your ping seems fine without it running. You could try using an ethernet connection if you're currently on wifi, but overall its most likely OBS slowing things down.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Victorious Nasus","date":"2017-11-22T03:14:33.672+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Looks like streaming eats your limited bandwidth, and it's not a small chomp.\nTest it:\nSee if you have less ping with the worse quality video stream available compared to a higher quality","replies":[]}]}
