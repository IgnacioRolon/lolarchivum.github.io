We aren't banning for custom skins right now, but we could change that stance at any time.  You are also responsible if any malicious content is hiding within those programs, and we wouldn't be able to offer you support.  It would be in your best interest to stay cautious!","replies":[{"poster":"Cław or Spear","date":"2017-08-06T01:46:41.693+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok, Thank you, what if the skin is kinda like one of your skins that riot has made but it was player made?
