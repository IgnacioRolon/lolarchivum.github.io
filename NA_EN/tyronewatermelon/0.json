Aatrox shows up to help the losing side, but he prolongs the conflict until it has run its course.  Jax shows up and ends it.\n\nI don't know.  Really I'm just spitballing.  Before the retcon I had a headcannon where Jax was an agent of the IoW (Maybe even the grand summoner) secretly working to keep things working.  I had a story idea involving the void invading (which starts with Cho'gath deciding his bored with the league now and breaks out) which leads Jax and a bunch of other IoW champions tasked to not only stopping the void, but uniting every faction they can to fight them.\n\nI'm rambling at this point.
