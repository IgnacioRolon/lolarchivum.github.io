All introduced new VO to various degrees. Ashe actually had three VO updates, the first original one, the one after her Visual Update, and the one in Freljord event. Anivia as well, she certainly did not have this much of VO before the event, no original champion had that much initially.\n\nEventually, each champion to some degree will have new VOs. Buzt you must realize that recording VOs for several languages and then needed to be released at the same time on all servers takes more time that people would like to think.

The Bilgwater event brought up more lore after the league retcon, expanded a few characters (or flattened them depending on how you view it) and reworked Gangplank (Who I'm not so sure needed a rework.  But he got one).\n\nOf course it shouldn't be for the sake of a few lines, but a lore expansion on these champs is something that a lot of people would like to see.  I don't see why we couldn't have an event based on it?  Maybe not as big as Bilgwater, or maybe an event that involves two factions fighting it out.\n\nSay the return of Azir and his action of rising an entire city out of sand has been viewed as active aggression against nearby factions (Like Mt.Targon).  Perhaps these factions used to be apart of Azir's empire and he decides that it's time for them to remember who they obeyed.  Such an event could be used to finally update the Shurima bios and expand on the lore of a faction (Like Mt.Targon).  Perhaps the Solari originally started in Shurima or a century after its fall when they discovered powerful artifacts from it?  \n\nOr maybe the Shadow Isles are where the Lunari have originated?  People have drawn connections to {{champion:120}} and the Lunari based on the crescent shapes on his head and weapon (they probably went into more detail).  Perhaps Mordekasier was behind the madness of the Ruined King, thus instigating a possible crusade for the Lunari (which we don't know if the Lunari started it all) that the Solari had to put a stop to.\n\nThis doesn't even begin to question how Demacia and Noxus feel about an entire city popping out in the middle of a desert overnight.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"VulcanIsHere","date":"2015-09-04T11:41:19.571+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mt.
