Plain and simple. I bet no one would ever see those disruptive 1v9 champions ever again. The beauty here is that I don't need to name any champion because no one gives a fook about my personal opinion, but we all get to decide which champions are not fun to play with and against.\nAnd those champions who can never make their ways to the Rift need nerf. That also fix the balance issue between highly coordinated pro games and solo queue.\n\nBut of course, Riot would intentionally want to create 1v9 meta champions so those players will think they are really good and buy more sh*t.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-06-01T20:56:24.426+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"This wont make the game more balanced, it will just narrow the champion pool, annoy everyone, and narrow the width of the imbalance.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Davaken","date":"2018-06-01T22:20:57.609+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"There are so many problems with this idea, I don't even know where to start.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kai Guy","date":"2018-06-01T21:04:01.224+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"10 champions to be picked. 15 bans per team. requires every player to own 41 champions  to prevent a situation your locked out of being able to play.
