I can only play 2 hrs a day so this means i can get if im lucky only 2 games a day. Meaning that for one game i left for one single game i left, i have to spend 3 days or more just trying to get out. Why i mean come on they even say its okay if you have gtg because life happens. Well life happened and now i have to wait 3 days or more just to get out of this 20 min queue. Thanks alot riot.","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-11-15T03:56:21.544+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just because you got a low-priority queue after leaving one match doesn't mean all the previous matches you left had nothing to do with it. Two hours a day to play LoL is a pretty hefty chunk of time, so there's no need to get greedy and keep queuing for matches until your mother tells you it's time to stop.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2019-11-15T01:45:19.807+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Life doesn't happen that frequently for you to get a 5x20 minute leaver buster.

You are responsible for managing you time. if you got a lengthier punishment I'm guessing this isnt the first time that this has happened. Just manage your time better. if you only have time for one game safely, then just play one game. its not great but again, it's on you to take responsibility and make the correct decision. If you enter a game and leave 10 minutes in, even if your team surrenders at 15 minutes, thats still 5 minutes for each player at 5v4 which is not a fun experience for your team at the very least, and all nine players at the most. This means that there are is up to 45 minutes of uneven gameplay total because of your poor time management. That doesn't count other consequences (LP loss, etc) that may come of it.","replies":[{"poster":"Silent Gravity","date":"2019-11-15T09:39:00.160+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"The full 15 minutes are wasted, not just the 5 where the OP was AFK. Then there's also Queue Time, Ban, Pick, and Loading.\n\n20 minute LPQ x 5 games is 100 minutes. Just the 15 minutes x9 is already 135 minutes. That's if the team surrenders asap, and if you ignore all the other invested time.\n\n20x5 is an injustice. It's like stealing 200 dollars and being fined 100 for it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Yin Yang Taoist","date":"2019-11-15T04:10:09.772+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"OP.

When you get upset about how your time was wasted, know that you wasted more time.\n\nAlso, this is all because of your actions. Don't 'thank riot'. Blame yourself.
