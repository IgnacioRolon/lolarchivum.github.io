After the server move, I maintained ping from typically 28-40(50 sometimes) and barely received lag. This was going on for a good year until recently this year, I've been getting consistent lag/ping spikes over and over again as I play my games, and it's making me not want to even log on anymore when I know that the main reason I'm losing my games is because I lag during laning phase and become unable to cs properly, trade properly, or even roam efficiently. The spikes are typically ranging from 100-400 and when they go down I'll be back at around 30ish ping, but it just keeps happening and happening and HAPPENING. I don't know if it's the weather here, or something up with the servers to if it's just me. I reset my router consistently in hopes to reduce this lag, I use Razer Game Booster as well, I reinstalled league, and my internet service provider is Verizon Fios. I was on an upward climb at the start of this season and then this hit. I'm not hardstuck D5 because of it. Please help.","replies":[{"poster":"ROBbeenHOOD","date":"2017-03-24T08:44:47.397+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi, I am also from the NYC area with a Verizon ISP and I face the same problem.\n\nAfter switching to an ethernet cable, deleting Skype and cleaning up my PC, my ping went from ~40ms to a very steady 25ms. However, during certain games I will get the ~300ms ping spike and it is during a crucial moment like the first gank or team fight. When this happens I keep watch for a scripter and I usually find one. The scripting is nearly always accompanied with verbal abuse or taunts.\n\nAnyway, from my observations the conclusion I came to is that there is a ping hack that players are using to sabotage gameplay. \n\nThe Skype ping hack is IP based, and after deleting Skype and renewing my IP, I didn't have this problem for about a week but recently it has returned.\n\nTo my knowledge, Riot has never addressed this issue. I am almost certain the cause is malicious software.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-18T17:43:13.032+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like your connection has been degrading over the course of the year, but I'd like to help.  Your network could just be degrading and could need some tuning up.  There could be some other issues like how your ISP is getting to our game servers, which it certainly could during peak hours.  \n\nMy suggestion is to start off by going over each step of the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to help tune things up.  I would also suggest to not use any game booster or third party programs while troubleshooting, just in case it may be causing additional issues.    Test it out in a custom game and let me know if you're still running into trouble.","replies":[{"poster":"Kimmy K","date":"2017-03-19T01:39:25.017+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry for taking so long to respond, I finished testing out each step in the connection issues guide excluding the few I didn't need to worry about such as configuring my DNS (since I'm not playing from outside the country). I let league through my firewall, added the necessary ports, release/renewed my ip as well as flushed my DNS. Things do feel smoother, but I'm still getting spikes. Using this method ([link](https://documentation.meraki.com/zGeneral_Administration/Tools_and_Troubleshooting/Troubleshooting_packet_loss_between_devices), I checked to see if it was packet loss and here's my results: ([link](https://gyazo.com/670127b019036b01519405240a39f74d) So, I'm still confused as to what's the problem.
