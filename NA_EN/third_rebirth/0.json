I&#039;ve looked around and found that it seems to be because he is on sale independently in the regular store as well. Does this mean I have to wait a week to make my purchase? Because that actually sucks and feels like I&#039;ve wasted 10 dollars, because then I&#039;ll just buy Lee Sin with IP and probably just skip on the skin.\n\nError: &#039;An unexpected error has occurred, please try again later.&#039;\n\nEdit. I tried again later by the way. Several times.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-06-06T16:54:08.225+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Third Rebirth - \n\nUnfortunately, that's the case. Currently, if something is available in the regular shop, you will receive an error if you're trying to purchase the same content in your personalized offers.","replies":[{"poster":"Third Rebirth","date":"2016-06-06T19:24:11.673+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alright thanks for letting me know. I ended up buying Lee Sin and just used the RP to buy the skin and another one in the shop. All worked out at least. Hope it gets fixed in the future.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-06-07T17:02:43.063+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the follow up!
