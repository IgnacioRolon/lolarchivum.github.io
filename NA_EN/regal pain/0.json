I encountered a problem with my whimsy when I tried to use it on fiddle after he ult-d. I tried to interrupt his ulti more than once using whimsy and every time fiddle remained un-fuzzied and still very murder-y. my whimsy would work normally to interrupt his drain or when chasing but for some reason did not seem to work post teleport during his ulti. Is this a bug or does he become un-interruptable at that point?\r\n\r\nany insight would be greatly appreciated, thanks in advance.\r\n-regal","replies":[{"poster":"Vicvictorw","date":"2015-01-14T07:00:44.023+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Once Fidds completes his ult channel and flashes in, that can't be interrupted.\n\nYes, whimsy will polymorph him, but there will still be the circle of death around him.\n\nIt has always worked this way.

If you stop him while he channels, then everything is okay.\n\nFew things feel as satisfying as slapping a fidd down right before the channel finishes.","replies":[{"poster":"regal pain","date":"2015-01-15T04:36:40.230+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was attempting to do that, and the one time I got to him before he blinked forward it worked normally.  I was wondering if that was the case, I had not seen anything in the description of his ulti that suggests that but it makes sense.  thanks for the response.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
