After I enter my username and password and try to log in, it says that there is an unknown error and go to support on the League of Legends website, I've tried that but that doesn't work. After I log in the 2nd time, it just stays at Authenticating... and doesn't stop loading, I wait for about 10 hours and waited to see if I had succesfully logged on, but it was still at Authenticating... and never stopped, please someone help me. :(","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-29T21:27:07.974+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm here to help!
