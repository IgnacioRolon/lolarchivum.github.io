that &quot;hey, i&#039;m winning as a non meta pick, please do the best you can&quot;\r\n\r\ngranted that&#039;s not verbatim\r\n\r\n\r\nOpti\r\nim sorry\r\n\r\nbut their chat doens&#039;t mattter\r\nYou\r\nbut that was the general message\r\n\r\n\r\nOpti\r\nit is how YOU chose to respond\r\nYou\r\nyeah, i said hey i&#039;m winning stfu and do the best you can....\r\n\r\nhow is that being negative?\r\n\r\n\r\nOpti\r\nim sorry\r\n\r\nbut i will not debate these with you\r\nYou\r\ndon&#039;t be sorry, please explain to me\r\n\r\n\r\nOpti\r\nthese are examples\r\n\r\ntelling people

said, essentially, please do you best\r\n\r\n\r\nOpti\r\nyou&#039;re talk ing baout everyone else\r\n\r\nat the end of the day\r\n\r\nyou&#039;re responsible for what you say\r\nYou\r\nyes, and i used no hate speech, tried to advise my allies on how to do their best, and played my best all game long\r\n\r\nso again, i don&#039;t understand what i&#039;m banned for.\r\n\r\n\r\nOpti\r\nyou dont have to use hatespeech to get punished\r\nYou\r\nplease, tell me how i violated your ToS?\r\n\r\n\r\nOpti\r\nI&#039;ve noticed is that the chats are extensive\r\n\r\nchat is meant to be a tool for positivity and strategies\r\n\r\nwriting a ton in chat takes away from that\r\nYou\r\nand that&#039;s exactly how i used it\r\n\r\nso correct me if i&#039;m wrong: you&#039;re telling me that telling my support not to go solo top is negativity?\r\n\r\neven though a support&#039;s job is BASICALLY to provide vision, make plays, and aid an adc in staying alive?\r\n\r\nor did i get banned for just excessive chat?\r\n\r\n\r\nOpti\r\nyou were banned for your attited\r\n\r\nattitude*\r\nYou\r\nexcuse me, but tell me exactly what you mean...\r\n\r\n\r\nOpti\r\nwriting a ton in chat is a factor too, not thee reason\r\nYou\r\ni was positive all game\r\n\r\ni played the best i could all game\r\n\r\nand i tried to help my allies all game\r\n\r\n\r\nOpti\r\nbut you weren&#039;t.\r\nYou\r\nhow

the chat man... the first message you copy pasta&#039;d was after i said &quot;hey support don&#039;t go solo top&quot;\r\n\r\n\r\nOpti\r\nwhich in itself is negative and can get you punsihed\r\nYou\r\nand the rest of the messages you copy pasta&#039;d were me telling my team &quot;hey, don&#039;t ban out champs your allies have highlighted&quot;\r\n\r\n\r\nOpti\r\nyou asked for examples\r\nYou\r\nhow is that any more negative than the guy who banned the champ i had highlighted in pregame?\r\n\r\n\r\nOpti\r\ni am giving them to you\r\n\r\nagain, this is not a debate\r\n\r\nman, come on\r\n\r\nthat guy does not matter\r\n\r\nyou matter\r\n\r\n:(\r\nYou\r\nyou&#039;re right it&#039;s not, cause you&#039;re not making ANY valid points dude\r\n\r\n\r\nOpti\r\nwhat YOU said matters\r\n\r\nthat guy will be in a different conversation\r\n\r\nwe&#039;ll talk to him if he writes in\r\nYou\r\nyou&#039;re saying that i&#039;m the negative one because i said &quot;hey man, don&#039;t ban champs your allies have chosen to play&quot;\r\n\r\nand then i said &quot;hey man go ahead, report me for playing a champ you dont like&quot;\r\n\r\nthat is somehow negativity?\r\n\r\nplease explain how\r\n\r\n\r\nOpti\r\nlet me ask you this\r\n\r\ndo either of those things help you win the game?\r\nYou\r\nokay let me ask you this: if 4 people would&#039;ve reported me for playing soraka top (and doing awesome) without my defending myself, would you still have banned me?\r\n\r\n\r\nOpti\r\nno, please answer my question.\r\nYou\r\nokay, realistically no, those comments don&#039;t help me or my allies win the game....\r\n\r\n\r\nOpti\r\nalright\r\n\r\nin general\r\nYou\r\nbut also, them telling me i&#039;m trolling all game long, just because of my champ, doesn&#039;t help me win\r\n\r\nso... did you ban/punish them?\r\n\r\n\r\nOpti\r\nasking for reports is negative. it keeps the focus on porr behaviors. and it only takes ONE report to get reviewed, so it doens&#039;t matter.\r\n\r\ni can&#039;t tell you abotu thenm\r\nYou\r\nmeh, bro that&#039;s ONE example from a 30 minute game in which i literally did the best i could all game long\r\n\r\n\r\nOpti\r\nfor privacy reasons\r\nYou\r\nand tried to help my team\r\n\r\n\r\nOpti\r\nyou&#039;re right\r\n\r\nit is one example\r\n\r\nthere are other\r\nYou\r\nso you REALLY believe, that this game warrants me getting a 14 day ban?\r\n\r\n\r\nOpti\r\nexample 2: your chat is pretty long, we want you to focus on the game. talking a bunch removes focus\r\n\r\nyes\r\n\r\nyou just had chat restrictions :(\r\nYou\r\nokay well i can&#039;t wait to post this chat history to your boards then....\r\n\r\nbecause i didn&#039;t do anything wrong\r\n\r\ni did the best i could\r\n\r\nand i tried to help my allies\r\n\r\ngranted, you&#039;re right dude, i said one stupid thingh\r\n\r\n\r\nOpti\r\ni know its frustrating\r\n\r\nim sorry you dealt with this\r\n\r\nfor the record\r\nYou\r\ni&#039;m glad to know you guys ban everyone who says one stupid thing in every game\r\n\r\n\r\nOpti\r\ni think soraka top isn&#039;t the worst\r\n\r\nalthough i think tanks should be top\r\n\r\nimo\r\nYou\r\nit&#039;s heart warming to know that you guys ban everyone who plays 1 non meta pick and says 1 stupid thing every game\r\n\r\nthat&#039;s really comforting\r\n\r\n\r\nOpti\r\nagain\r\n\r\ni told you\r\n\r\nthat wasn&#039;t the case\r\n\r\nat all\r\nYou\r\nit was exactly the case, according to what you&#039;ve told me here...\r\n\r\n\r\nOpti\r\n&quot;it&#039;s heart warming to know that you guys ban everyone who plays 1 non meta pick&quot; - i literally told you this was not the case\r\nYou\r\nlol, how did you omit the second half of that statement?\r\n\r\n\r\nOpti\r\n:(\r\n\r\nthe second have is kinda true\r\n\r\nbut im saying playing soraka had zero to do with the ban\r\nYou\r\nsoooo you&#039;re saying, 1 statement of negativity, is enough to warrant a 14 day ban?\r\n\r\nregardless of prior chat restrictions?\r\n\r\n\r\nOpti\r\nno\r\n\r\nthe opposite\r\n\r\nyuou&#039;ve had chat restrictions\r\n\r\nand because you&#039;re still being negative\r\nYou\r\nyeah, i have, you&#039;re right\r\n\r\n\r\nOpti\r\nwe took further action\r\nYou\r\nhow was i negative?\r\n\r\n\r\nOpti\r\nim sorry\r\n\r\nbut we already discussed this\r\n\r\n:(\r\nYou\r\nadvising allies not to ban the champ i had selected is negativity?\r\n\r\n\r\nOpti\r\nyes\r\n\r\nwhen you&#039;re in game\r\n\r\nthat does nothing to win\r\n\r\nthreataning\r\n\r\nand talking about it\r\n\r\nover and over\r\n\r\ntalking about reports\r\nYou\r\nactually it does serve to helping them win in the

If you /muted all as soon as they \"flamed\" you, you wouldn't be banned right now! \n\nAlso, no, you can't \"defend\" yourself. You also weren't \"defending\" yourself; you were just being a brat. You were bickering with your \"flamers\" which makes you a flamer also. If you _were_ defending yourself, it would be more like \"I'm not trolling, I'm actually trying, bear with me\" then did a /mute all. But you didn't! And that's entirely your fault. You weren't forced to reply, at all. The whole bit with \"I feel obligated to tell my teammates I'm no trolling\" is far from the truth, you are only obligated to try. Not to type all damn game. And yes, you can get punished for chatting it up too much. It's called [spam](http://prntscr.com/ibovky). And yes, what you were typing was spam, look at the definition I clipped with it. Your chat was [irelevant](http://prntscr.com/ibovuf), and that's very much punishable, by all means. If it isn't necessary (and no, saying you aren't trolling 2+ times is not relevant to the game.), it's punishable. Period.\n\nI myself have been banned for 14 days and took a month off afterwards and realized how terrible I was. I was also \"defending\" myself against terrible meanies ;( but in the end it doesn't matter if they spammed the chat with \"You're trash\" over and over, while you only said \"stfu\", you can very much still get in trouble for that. It's actually extremely obvious to see how wrong you were if you would stop and actually comprehend what YOU did. YOU. Y O U. Not \"oh but this person did this\", Riot DOESN'T CARE. Neither should you. \n\nTake it from another person who struggled with toxicity; you're punished for a damn good reason 90% of the time.
