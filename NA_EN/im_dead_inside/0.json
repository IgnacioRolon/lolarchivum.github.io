I had to lock in the champion first to be able to select a skin. In the current client (legacy), I'm able to select a skin for a champion that I declared without having to lock them in. Again, this \"issue\" is in blind pick normals, and please correct me if I'm wrong. Thanks :)\r\n\r\n(repost from Gameplay board to Help &amp; Support board)","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-16T02:27:40.023+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Having to lock in your champion choice **before** being able to select a skin for that champion is working as intended.

I personally think it's a bad idea, so I'm hoping it stays the way it is in the legacy client right now.","replies":[]}]}]}
