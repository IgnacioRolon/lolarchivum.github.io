We can try manually resetting those files to see if that cleans things up a bit and makes the client readable. \n\nGo into the default League folder, should be C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config, and then let's just......delete the entire folder. Yup, just go ahead and delete that whole Config folder. Once it's deleted, the client with create new fresh files with the default settings and you should be good to go!","replies":[{"poster":"Dan the Chungus","date":"2017-05-06T14:35:57.930+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it didnt work bro poro.
