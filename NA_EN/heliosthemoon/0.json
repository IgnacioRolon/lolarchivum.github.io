New player thinking about playing ranked","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, so I&#039;m a little newbie to League, been playing since this Summer (2018).\r\nTo get familiar with the game, I tried not to pollute Ranked with my lack of experience, though recently I&#039;ve been learning how to play multiple champs, how to mix up a build and the general mechanics of the game as well as basic tactics (late game 1-3-1). My friends keep boasting about their plat and diamond rankings so I thought maybe I should hop into the fun before Iron division pops up.\r\n\r\nI was wondering if ranked is much different compared to unranked and how different it can be. What should I do &quot;get good&quot; (to quote literally everyone to literally everyone on unranked). Should I pick up a one trick? I really like {{champion:103}}  for... reasons, {{champion:28}} because she&#039;s fun to learn how to gank with and {{champion:39}} since she is pretty mobile. \r\n\r\nIf you guys think I should join, feel free to say why and give a fellow player tips and tricks on how to gain ELO in a constant manner,\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nHeliosTheMoon\r\nArkadeFoxe (PBE)","replies":[{"poster":"Terozu","date":"2018-10-11T18:45:29.027+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The only actual difference is people flame more, and you get a rank out of it. *Shrugs*","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kelg","date":"2018-10-11T21:05:06.357+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just pick a handful of champs you like and get really good at them. Yes, some champs are stronger than others, but every champ is viable if you know them well. So just play your favorites, you'll enjoy the game more that way.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Quiet Dude","date":"2018-10-11T19:07:10.617+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Get really good at 2-3 champs in every role. Dont worry about counter picking, either. Biggest mistake I see in new ranked players is people worrying about counterpicking and being counterpicked.\n\nSkill with a champion you know > not much experience with a champion that counterpicks your lane opponent","replies":[]},{"poster":"MutantVapes","date":"2018-10-11T19:06:14.414+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I started in ranked before I should've. Take this advice if you will, the game starts you off at around silver MMR. that being said if you aren't a silver level player yet, ( as I wasn't) you will probably get stomped until it finally realizes where you need to be. That being said if you fall down to bronze... good luck. I'm not a great player, to begin with, but I got placed Bronze 1 and stopped playing rank to learn the game better before continuing to drop and ruin peoples fun. Now I'm a much better player but not good enough to hard carry out of bronze and from my experience people don't want to work together in Bronze UNLESS its when they need you.  So now I feel like I am hard stuck bronze until I can carry my way out. :( Take your time and just have fun don't rush into anything :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Inkling Commando","date":"2018-10-11T19:05:38.606+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"don't do it it's a trap!","replies":[]},{"poster":"DODGEORLOSE","date":"2018-10-11T19:04:45.641+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you wanna get good, limit the amount of champs you play. That's the reason it's easier for otps to climb. Once you've got the champ mechanics down you can more easily focus on other parts of the game. Decision making is far more important than silver players think.","replies":[]},{"poster":"HommeGoujon","date":"2018-10-11T19:02:41.422+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just go for it. There isn't much difference except that people are somehow more serious AKA Toxic about the game and everybody think they know all there is to know and how to play every champ etc. They will rankshame you if they can, they'll call you trash and noob but it doesn't really matter because as long as you try your best. Ignore the trolls/flamers and report at the end of your game.\nAlso, some people have that fear to be seen as a bad player because they can't reach a certain level in the ladder. Don't be, there is no need for that.\nIf you're having two or three bad games in a row, just stop playing for a while, get some fresh air or play some ARAM or w/e.\nIf you can play two - three champs in your roles, it's already a great start by the way. Focus on a small pool of champions but try to learn how other champs are played (mainly champs you're the most likely to face in your lane).\nFocus on yourself, your game and your mistakes and not on your partners' coz that's the only way to get better.\n\nThat's pretty much all I have for you.\n\nOR, you can wait 'til preseason and start from there with less pressure and with all the new changes that are coming. Up to you.","replies":[]}]}
