Through my adventures I encountered a lot of very immature players. Now these players had a good understanding basic knowledge of the game and was most likely players who were banned before for toxicity or just alt accounts(see how I did not say smurfs xd). Upon playing on this account it was just negative activity and players leaving the game and just so much hate it was ridiculous. I feel so bad for new players playing the game. In the past 2 weeks of playing on that account I have gotten **nearly 6 accounts banned or suspended.**This is actually ridiculous and I think Riot needs to start IP banning(I know this won&#039;t stop people but it will keep some from getting through) or try and figure something out. I think this is absolutely ridiculous and no wonder we have such a toxic community.","replies":[{"poster":"AeroWaffle","date":"2018-08-10T13:21:12.988+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":3,"body":"Your experience leveling a new account is going to be different than a new player leveling a new account.

As you stated, it won't stop people. An external IP address is easy to change, especially if you have a dynamic IP (just reset your router). Secondly, it causes a lot of collateral damage. An entire college dorm might share a single external IP address.

For perspective I am a Wood Division level player that was getting back into the game with a friend of mine. We have only had one game in the past 2 months with a seriously toxic player. My guess is the smurfs are the source of the toxicity. \n\nAs for IP banning that strikes me as a little extreme, it would basically be like burning down a house to get rid of the rats. We've all thought about it at some point, but we eventually realize it's probably overkill and will upset a lot of random folks.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MYSTlCFLOW","date":"2018-08-11T07:20:00.969+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=AeroWaffle,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=pWhHHUoL,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-08-10T13:21:12.988+0000)\n>\n> Your experience leveling a new account is going to be different than a new player leveling a new account.
