I had a really bad game and i was really damn toxic. To feel better my dumb mind started pressing buttons on my keyboard and my league client exited fullscreen. So now i were playing in halfscreen, i couldn't control the ''camera view'' in game with my mouse and I couldn't enter fullscreen with the ''fullscreen button'' in the right or make my client bigger at all.\r\n\r\nSO i wonder, do someone know which buttons i pressed and how to fix this misery i've put myself into?   {{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}}","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-29T15:50:29.911+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry to hear the game turned so sour.  :/  You might be able to restore your screen by pressing Alt+Enter.  If that doesn't work, resetting your config will restore your settings to default as well.\n\nLog into the game client.\nNavigate to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config\nDelete the file  named **game.cfg** and **persistedsettings.json**\nGo into a custom game and verify that settings have saved properly.  Leave game to sync settings.\n\nI hope that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"PYROMAGNIUM","date":"2017-04-27T12:53:30.968+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Man i have a problem too...i cant play on full screen...i did all that things u said and stll cant play...wtf is going on rito.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-04-27T15:42:50.366+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd like to help!
