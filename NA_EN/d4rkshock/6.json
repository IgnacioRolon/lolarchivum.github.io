For the most part, he&#039;sa bad champion but I wouldn't say troll pick  unless you're old tyler1 and much so in higher elos that he needs to build tank so he doesn&#039;t feed. I also can see him as an anti splitpush champion. Most splitpushers are as reliant and the blind is annoying.unless he gets super far ahead, he doesn&#039;t really do much. Also don&#039;t believe me when I say he&#039;s bad??? Teemo mains tend to play the game for fun and not to win the game and not trollpick. If he were good, the optimal build would be hybrid.the reason it&#039;s seen in low elo is because nobody is good.","replies":[]}
