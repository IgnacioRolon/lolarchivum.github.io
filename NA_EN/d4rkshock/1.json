Ahyvana, udyr,and yi. Tanks build runic echis. Tye meta was in complete shambles back then. Then eventually, riot gutted her to the point where she was. Bad champion. They then reworked her. I havent seen her alot even after. I did play againstone as jax jg and obviously since she,&#039;s an adc, she got demolished. I just kept taking those acuttle crabs and killing her if she tried to take it. I did look at her winrate andits at a 50%. Anyways is she useable.","replies":[{"poster":"Aatrox Mid 1v5","date":"2017-12-03T23:03:24.095+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"No. shes one of Riot's most poorly designed champions to be honest.","replies":[]},{"poster":"I am Pacman","date":"2017-12-03T22:54:56.241+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"She is very viable at the moment.  It requires a bit of research and practice to get her down but you can easily carry.  One of my friends mains pretty much only kindred jungle.","replies":[{"poster":"La Belle Sauvage","date":"2017-12-04T04:22:07.487+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree. I sometimes jungle. Switched with a top laner in one match and took Kindred for the first time. It went very easy (5-3-9). Lost the next norm (3-6-1), and came close to  carrying  in the next norm, which I rarely do in my typical Lane Top. Went 15-7-17. In my first 3 matches I felt quite easy. \n\nCompare that to my first 3 Fiora matches (0-3) and Riven (0-3) I say Kindred is viable at least in Low ELO.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Shadòw","date":"2017-12-03T22:54:47.835+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No she is an item","replies":[{"poster":"d4rkshock","date":"2017-12-03T23:59:57.165+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Shadòw,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=vaxBJWE3,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2017-12-03T22:54:47.835+0000)\n>\n> No she is an item\n\nyou mean a ward","replies":[{"poster":"fƒ15","date":"2017-12-04T05:29:33.644+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you mean a mana pot","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Żügżwäng","date":"2017-12-04T04:32:58.562+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes. Her ult requires some mroe advanced game knowledge, but it usually goes in your favour since many people don't know how to play around it:\n1. they panic and run out of the circle.\n2. they don't know how to save their damage/time the expiration of the circle/heal\n\nboth things usually result in the kindred coming out on top. that being said, it can ruin your teammates too. ive seen some funny times where a kindred ulted to save herself on a fail gank, her teammate tries to run, giving me a free double on them (well free single, the double was more of a \"wild west draw\" kind of scenario)\n\n(this is at gold and lower, not sure this \"misplaying\" exists at higher elo, maybe it does)","replies":[]},{"poster":"ItsMaybelline","date":"2017-12-03T22:54:03.953+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"She's in a pretty good spot right now historically due to the strength of Press The Attack. She has good damage, flexible itemization now that she can be built bruiser using dark harvest, great mobility, and isn't someone people are used to playing against. Overall, yes she is a viable champ for most Elos, however she may be an uphill battle to learn and play. It's preseason, so take this with a grain of salt. If you'd like proof though, look up Forest Within, he has like a 70% winrate or something ridiculous like that.","replies":[]}]}
