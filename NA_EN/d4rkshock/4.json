I did actually get a rumble mid and that&#039;s anasty matchup for ryze but I didn&#039;t die at all that game and I got 7 kills and the enmy team surredered at 20 before I could cause some real pain. The game before where we surrendered but I didn't want to, I was ok. So far I found if you need to just do damage qeqwq. If a gank is coming or you need the IM FAS AS FUCK BOIZ and shield, qewq.  Escape is previous but with r. Rip {{item:3157}}  because {{item:2419}}  which is cancer and riot nerfed  the ult because of it. Anyways is ryze an easy champion to learn but with no skill cap at all like{{champion:268}} {{champion:238}} {{champion:157}} ","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2018-07-15T09:13:23.691+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Teamfights is when things get nasty, given Ryze can only hit what's directly in front of him as Q doesn't pass units and that E->E->Q for spread damage takes a while to prepare and often fights would be over before you can do a single spread damage.\n\nAlso, mana management. Ryze has one of the worst mana/resource management in the entire game especially given his kit forces him to spam in spite of his pretty insane mana cost (combined with the low base damage all around), so for some his resource management especially for early game, takes a while to get used to.\n\nRyze is also very vulnerable if you have an hard engage champion as your opponent, and hard-engage comp on enemy side and enemy lane-camping would be your nightmares.\n\nThen there is the ulti, it's quite hard to actually use especially the level 6 version. You need to have some good map awareness and foresight to use it properly in solo queue as a solo player, because no one would be watching your back or what's ahead of you and reporting it to you in efficient manner. With comms it reduces the strain of using Ryze's R which allows it to be an insanely strong if not OP spell under those settings, while in solo setting, it's very hard to use right most of the time, and is the biggest contributing factor to why there is such a rift between Ryze's professional and solo queue play. Honestly, Riot really should just change this ulti already, given it's nothing but a balance trainwreck.\n\nWhatever the case, in solo queue, especially for those unfamiliar with Ryze, he's definitely not easy to play.","replies":[]},{"poster":"FullmuteAll play","date":"2018-07-15T14:33:28.321+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you just need high APM to play him well and of course hit skillshots well.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Madsin25","date":"2018-07-15T13:03:46.300+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes ryze is a champion with an insanely high skill curve. \n\nHowever azir is so far in the gutter with nerfs that not even his mains are doing good.\n\nThe champs with the highest skill curves ATM are as follows.

Especially since he's so reliant on getting to late game and proper combos at right times. I'm sure the Rumble was just really, really bad, but the match-up itself didn't hurt. Ryze has even been played top like other range champs.\n\n\nIf you're finding yourself liking him, then play him more by all means since he can do so much damage. But be sure you prepare yourself for some very unfavorable match-ups.","replies":[]}]}
