It&#039;s like the riot balance department was stuck with having to make him work s o the just stuck shit on him to force him to work and then got nerfed into the ground.either the shield is strong enough to protect him and he shoves lane or he can just be ignored. It&#039;s the same thing as swain except swain is actually good. Here&#039;s rengar&#039;s combo. R,q, (timat). Thats essentially a 1hit since the q usually kills after the ult. Sure he can only jump the closest champion and can&#039;t kill them over and over for stacks but that doesn&#039;t change the fact that the rift looks so much better in black and white. It used to be 3 q&#039;s and now it&#039;s just 1ðŸ˜­. So was this rework a failure.","replies":[{"poster":"EcchiOtakuTM","date":"2016-11-15T16:49:48.601+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rengar's rework was not a failure keeping bonetooth was.\n\nBonetooth ALWAYS breaks rengar since RELEASE.\n\nBonetooth is far too inconsistent to be balancable since it's completely based on player kills.\n\nThis one is far more consistent however due to it, it's binary.\n\nCurrent one enables direct FULL tank rengar with just 1 AD item.\n(And no it's not W that enables it because taking less damage makes the heal really minor for such a long CD and 1.5 seconds is far to reactive for tank rengar to compare when it should be used.)\n\nIt really isn't \"fun\" just WTF factor from 500+ AD and unlike jhin, this kitty can AA constantly. Not to mention bonetooth enables the crit+AS on assassins balance issue.\n\nNow what rengar's bonetooth SHOULD have been replaced with is a kha's evolution mechanic.\n\nThis would be far more consistent since it's based off exp something you're sure to get, meaning balancable.\n\nIt would be FAR more fun because you can augment skills uniquely per match.(Even when meta skill maxes happen some kha will start augment r for more map pressure, e(rare) if the enemy reacts too well to his assassinations on their ally, w if he needs to add on a bit more cc and waveclear instead of Q.)\n\nIt fits his hunter theme because hunters aren't just about taking down prey and showing it off but taking their experienced gained from hunting to further develop their skills.\n\nIt will still envision his AvP theme because Predators have been shown to improve tech for use vs aliens.\n\nIt COULD still work off player kills, maybe per ulti rank takedown a specific enemy jungle camp or an enemy champion(unique so rank 2/3 can't be same target unless kha) (must do damage in 1.5 seconds of them dying for assist)\n\nHell to take it a step further killing kha doesn't augment skills until the event starts.(I also say maybe kha has to earn kills every ulti rank excluding rengar until the event starts. Which would tone him down, but my main focus is rengar.)\n\nNow for rengar's base skills:\n\nQ is SO much better than old Q finally addressed AS+Crit's balance issue(sustained damage on assassins eve, shaco and rengar had issues with it, only eve's trademark hate spikes remain QQ).\nNow they're MUCH better clear tool. His Q's delay also improves counterplay.\n\nW is a great assassin form of combat healing, I would say it's not comparable to the old but it does such in jungle except for the damage. It also isn't enabling tank rengar because if you take less damage it's harder to judge when to reactively use it and has a lengthy CD making tank get far less value from it.\n\nE, same e as always, now my issue here isn't it being a skillshot but the abuse case of just charging E for leap root is gone/given a counterable window. Why the hell were the changes to force it clunky not removed?\n\nR, change it to bonus damage not a crit. Overall R change, while disputed, was a dramatic improvement. Given proper counterplay, for more power. I would also go so far to say it fits rengar even more theme-wise. He's proud of himself and his skills, yes he's a combat genius, but he feels like the type who wants the thrill of having his prey knows he's coming and slowly near them apart.\n\nRengar's kha evolution could MAYBE:\n\nGrant first part of Q full AoE(not second)\n\nW maybe increased % healing? \n\nE maybe 2 charges?\n\nUlti- Empowered could mark targets 500 units near your marked target and they take 50% of the marked bonus damage. (Basically this empower would reveal more units near your closest and while your main mark is still juicier you'd still get slight damage on others if you can't find the right angle)\n\nRemember this is WITHOUT bonetooth, I do believe rengar w/o it is great, but I still question why even if assassin patch aren't major reworks what type of idea it was to keep bonetooth.\n\nAlso some VFX and SFV could be improved.\n\nRengar's old q being crit animation, rengar's old W lines are few things asked for.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Poop Jelly","date":"2016-11-15T03:00:24.918+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"From what I have seen, There's always one of the reworked champ that's put all the way to the top, meta-wise speaking. Think about it, Juggernaut = Morde (not anymore), ADC= Graves, Mages = Vlad, now Assassin = Rengar. Personally, I would like to say the Assassin overall was the best rework sessions because the other 3 champs are much more unique & interesting to play now. Then there's the pampered champion that's gonna be put on top as the \"strong\" reworked champ is Rengar. A bit salty cus I never really liked him, but gratz on Rengar mains, I guess...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Miror B","date":"2016-11-15T02:13:31.816+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I still don't get why exactly they reworked rengar in the first place. Not only was he balanced (so much that he was used in an NALCS game unlike stuff like kat/talon), but he was legitimately fun to play against and fit the \"Assassin\" theme perfectly. Get him ahead and he can 2 shot everyone, but the instant he falls behind he's useless. While I've only played the new one once, from what I have heard they basically made him a tankier version of yasuo with infinite dashes. Not sure if that's true, but considering they made it their goal to \"murder all mobility\" I would not be surprised considering they released/reworked a ton of characters to go around that \"rule\".","replies":[{"poster":"d4rkshock","date":"2016-11-15T02:50:09.356+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There was never time to react and once the ! appeaed above your head, you would die in half a second.

The new spell-shield item thingy that rito introduced effectively eliminated two of those options and made the third extremely difficult as you can't cc him now and warding has become basically useless (as he can gap-close around them). I'm actually pretty confused as to how you think old rengar was imbalanced, as if you play the game \"correctly\" and not make stupid mistakes then you're at best dealing with something like riven (in which he either goes 12-0 and murders everyone or goes 0-8 and can't even take his own jg camps without the risk of being 1 shot).","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Attticus Finch","date":"2016-11-15T02:21:58.688+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nope, he's fun to play and fairly strong.
