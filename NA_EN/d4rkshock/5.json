He has the highest winrate in bronze for toplane which is 53.3%. This just means I get to spam him and I have a backup. Tryndamere. He counters him f he doesn&#039;t use his wall properly. In terms of popularity... Let me give you a point of reference. Riven has the highest pickrate for top in bronze at 10.6%. yorick is at 3%. How hard he stomps is apparent because if I get ahad which happens more times then not, I win. You know how games go longer in bronze and silver. Yorick pushes so hard that I end games by 25 minutes. He also has a 1.5% ban rate. You&#039;d think that all these low elo champions would get picked more but nope. So why is this just out of curiosity.","replies":[{"poster":"Takazaki","date":"2017-07-19T02:08:44.702+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"because he is straight boring, nothing about seem is flashy or over the top.\n\nthats why champions like zed, riven, and yasuo have extensive player bases regardless of effectiveness of the champion.\n\nalso he has a very weak identity, a grave digging monk? in search for something or doing something who also talk to some ghost.","replies":[{"poster":"d4rkshock","date":"2017-07-19T06:38:31.562+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Takazaki,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=evtEgq0L,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2017-07-19T02:08:44.702+0000)\n>\n> because he is straight boring, nothing about seem is flashy or over the top.\n> \n> thats why champions like zed, riven, and yasuo have extensive player bases regardless of effectiveness of the champion.\n> \n> also he has a very weak identity, a grave digging monk? in search for something or doing something who also talk to some ghost.\n\nHe's talking to the maiden btw. It beces apparent when you summon the maiden. It's also hilarious how they see you at 1/4 HP and attack but you still kill them.","replies":[{"poster":"Takazaki","date":"2017-07-20T07:07:08.397+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ik who he is talking to, but its not on the levels of like when yasuo talks to riven or shen talks to zed. its just not impactful at all\nhe isnt appealing from a story perspective ( imo ) and game play perspective so there isnt a huge tug to him.\n\ni cant count the many times people think they can kill me faster then maiden and E and died trying.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Asayake 5150glow","date":"2017-07-19T00:13:09.890+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Man, how do you carry with Yorick?

You can bully them out of lane with your gouls. You are either playing too agressive since you main riven. It's kind of like tryndamere/nasus where he's more worried about farming and splitpushing in teamfights. Also I've made clutch plays where I have 1/4th hour and the have full hp and think \"yeah. I could probably kill him\" and kaboom. The q keeps healing me and they take alot of damage from the gouls and sometimes the ult. The reason you don't have trouble with yorick is because your playing riven. Yorick is countered by alot of skirmishers like riven, fiora, and yasuo(unless he's a trashuo). Also sometimes I get so fed that I kill 3 or 4 people in a fight. Im also getting consistent s ranks. It's to the point where I suprised I don't have lvl 7 tokens because they are s- ranks.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2017-07-19T01:01:38.419+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because most people in bronze just fanboy some higher elo player.","replies":[]}]}
