That means only about 1.4% of League's champions are black. Whilst the US is obviously not the only country to play League of Legends, it is one of the largest, and Riot Games was founded there. Approximately 13% of the US population is black.  We'd expect there to be closer to 17 black champions if we used US demographics. \n\nAs a living breathing gay man...I promise you that there're almost no men in League of Legends who are sexualized. Buff men are power fantasies for men. They aren't 'eye candy' for women or men who are attracted to men. If I so much as mention the fact that I have a boyfriend, I'm 'shoving my sexuality down others' throats'...meanwhile I get to listen to inane comments about Sona's or Ahri's breasts constantly.\n\nSome of us aren't straight white abled cisgendered men.

There're these whole communities of people who write thesis papers and gather data for Women's and Gender Studies, Sociology, and Anthropology. Those papers are even peer reviewed and harshly scrutinized..and then refined! Just like every other academic profession.\n\nI literally just provided you an actual statistic (which is easily verifiable) regarding black representation in League of Legends.\n\nHere's another one: There's exactly one champion who is confirmed gay out of the 141 champions in LoL. Two if we count Taric, where a developer mused in a Q&A that he probably wouldn't care about gender. That's .7% if we just count Varus, and 1.4% if we count Taric. Either way, the LGBT population in the US varies state to state, but is between 2-8%.\n\nThese ideas aren't anything radical and aren't being pulled out of nowhere.

There's good reasons for doing so. Have you ever heard the phrase 'the exception that proves the rule'?\n\nFor example consider this: 'Olaf removes all disables from himself and becomes immune to them for the next 6 seconds.'\n\nWe can glean, with no other knowledge, that champions are not typically immune to disables.

Until now, knowing that Jinx is lesbian would change absolutely nothing.\n\nAt this point it is just like in real life.

I donÂ´t mind using specific terms especially in academia where it is important to be more precise, but I feel it often gets used in an everyday-situations where are simpler description would have sufficed, just to set a statement, which then feels forced. Like I said I donÂ´t mind as long as I am not told how to speak. \n\n2. I guess the problem is, compared to sub-atomic particles, which only affects those, who study them, those social/political issues are something that involves everyone, so itÂ´s natural that everyone tries to prove their own opinions as the correct ones. My problem with this authoritarian approach is that it pretty much shuts down every chance of having a genuine dialogue. Imo as long as your arguments are valid your opinion is valid regardless of who you are.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Anin777","date":"2018-08-25T00:04:34.043+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Yago,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Oj4bUnci,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2018-08-24T22:56:40.925+0000)\n>\n> The problem isn&#x27;t that sexualized characters exist.\n> \n> The problem is that characters who are women are far more likely to be sexualized than men--independent of whether it makes sense for that character or in the world those characters live, and the way those characters are sexualized often appeals to only a very specific type of man. \n> \n> For example, there isn&#x27;t a single black woman in League of Legends, and there are only two black men.
