I&#039;ve realized how disgusting his damage is. He can 3 hit the adc. I even had a game where I got destroyed by a zed top and I fed my ass off in lane but I still caught up eventually and got a pentakill. The game before that,I was against St akali top and I killed her over and over to the point where she wasn&#039;t safe under tower like with huskar in DotA where if he gets ahead, he can dive and light you on fire and the damage from each burning spear stacks and he gets attack speed as his ho drops (similar to tryndamere/olaf). Anyways im not always going to get tryndafuck. I need a backup. I was thinking jax because helicopter attack.he evaded his aa&#039;s and basically gets free damage and stuns him. He also splitpushes almost evenly as hard and can teamfight. He also scales just as hard. Anyways is it a good idea to have jax as a backup.","replies":[{"poster":"Grimspeake","date":"2018-04-28T14:13:24.370+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just 1 trick tryndamere.

I played trynd yesterday into jax and completely dumpstered him and it wasn't that hard\n\nAll you have to do is bait his stun then spin away, then you have 17 seconds to bash his face in\n\nAlso if you run conqueror it kind of negates his ultimate defenses","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2018-04-28T10:09:30.645+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"**I suck at top lane.**\n\nJax has a good matchup against Tryndamere but if you are looking for another champ to play toplabe you should pick someone with different strengths instead of similar ones.\n\nLike, pick a tank for when your team needs an initiator or an early game champ for when your opponent has champs that scale well.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2018-04-28T09:26:28.114+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes he is. Because Jax's E (or \"dick spin\") can dodge AA and stun Trynd which is both beneficial during trade, teamfight focusing, as well as to stall him on his ulti rampage; and his Q allows him to escape Trynd easier too (as well as to follow him if Trynd escapes with his E).","replies":[]}]}
