He may be the bulkiest of the mages, but if he's the front line then your team's set up wrong. Thinking with a juggernaut mentality of following up on engages is generally the right approach with him (The amount of times I've been the closest thing to an engage the team has because everyone's an AD assassin...)","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Sotere","date":"2016-12-30T10:54:29.282+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yerp, really hard to get his positioning right.

Zhyonas is always great if you can get to  the back line while  in ult and  just zhyonas. swain ult keeps going when you zhyonas with him.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dehitay","date":"2016-12-30T08:45:02.826+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No and no.

I&#x27;m guessing they probly weren&#x27;t actually team fights, but you being outnumbered\n\nI have to agree with Dehitay on this, did you build Swain properly such as some AP/Health Tank? Namely with items like {{item:3065}} to make effective use of his ultimate's healing and team fighting fkery mechanic since your basically going to heal alot of health back if the entire enemy team is near you if they try to focus on you. Otherwise its kind of hard to imagine Swain being screwed, though technically his 'early game' in lane can be quite good against low mobility champions since he ends up tap damaging them pretty well with his placement abilities and especially if he manages to stun the opponent and get them to take most of the damage of that crow turret beam..whatever that one is called, never really played swain that much so i don't recall what each of his abilities are called and where they are placed.\n\nBut considering 'most' enemy opponents in lane fighting, they likely will have the mobility to avoid your stuff or just buy boots early and stomp on you relatively easy.\n\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SNSD Sunnny","date":"2016-12-30T08:50:51.604+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"swains early game is horrendous but his mid game is 10x better...\n\nalso never buy spirit visage unless you're getting both abyssal and spirit","replies":[]}]}
