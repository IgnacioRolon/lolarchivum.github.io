Please check you network connection and attempt to reconnect to your game\".  This has just started happening.  I can connect to everything else just fine and I've tried using Ethernet and WiFi.  This hasn't been happening on my Desktop though.  Note that my Laptop is windows 10 and Desktop windows 7 and I'm using the same account.  Has anyone else been having this problem?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-26T20:18:48.993+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like there may be specific settings on your laptop that could prevent your client from establishing a solid connection to the game server.
