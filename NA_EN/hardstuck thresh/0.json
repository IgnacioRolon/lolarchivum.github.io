Now in this I can&#039;t really talk about actual gameplay adjustments or nerfs or whatever because I am only Silver 5 (I have very little game knowledge and am not really good at the game. at all.) and I know that S5 is a pretty garbage rank compared to a lot of you who will respond to this but I can only really focus on aspects of the game that affect all levels of players. \r\n\r\n1. Get rid of the chat feature\r\nJust this alone could remove so much of the toxicity in the game amongst players, I personally feel like the only way a chat should be in the game is for groups playing together who know each other. Whenever I enter a game I always /muteall and rely on pings to communicate with my team because I can&#039;t deal with people spamming the chat and complaining about how the jungler didn&#039;t save their 0/10 kda.\r\n\r\n2. Greater rewards for the Honor System\r\nI think the relatively new honor system was a great addition to the game and it has motivated some of my friends to actually be respectful of the people that they are playing with. I think that if Riot were to offer up some very low RP skins for reaching different honor levels or maybe even your choice of a skin for max honor level then this could help improve the game a lot. \r\n\r\n3. Matchmake games based on age\r\nNow I know this may seem like a stupid idea but I know I can&#039;t be the only one who gets really fed up listening to the 10 year old Warwick complain about how I &quot;stole&quot; his red buff as Jax at 30 minutes. If games were age restricted, this could help separate the maturity levels of players and could possibly improve the game greatly.\r\n\r\nHopefully these ideas don&#039;t suck, we all need to make a difference in the League community for it to become a more positive place and I am trying to make a difference by putting this in the forums. Best of luck to all of you and see you in the game.","replies":[{"poster":"AeroWaffle","date":"2018-11-12T20:40:13.613+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":">Get rid of the chat feature\n\nYes, the chat system is abused by some. But many people use the chat system just fine without being rude and I'm not sure if I want the tool to be banned because some people misuse it.\n\n>Greater rewards for the Honor System\n\nI'd be fine with this, but from a business standpoint Riot doesn't want to give away too many free things. We already now get free skins where before we never got any free skins.\n\n>Matchmake games based on age\n\nHow do you propose actually enforcing the age restriction? Because without that all you've done is split the playerbase arbitrarily.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zombie Gerbil","date":"2018-11-12T21:51:49.596+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=dxlegault,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=d7EAn2cq,comment-id=,timestamp=2018-11-12T20:34:52.118+0000) I think that many of us can agree now that League of Legends has lost a lot of players recently and this can mostly be attributed to the fact that majority of the people who play are extremely toxic, arrogant, or just rude. \n\nNot true.\nI've met many more pleasant players and even more quiet players than toxic ones.\nI've been playing since beta and played for 10 years straight. Not denying the existence of toxicity, not at all, but saying it's the majority of the community is rather false.\n\n\n\n> [{quoted}](name=dxlegault,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=d7EAn2cq,comment-id=,timestamp=2018-11-12T20:34:52.118+0000)\n\n> Get rid of the chat feature\n> Just this alone could remove so much of the toxicity in the game amongst players, I personally feel like the only way a chat should be in the game is for groups playing together who know each other.

This is a personal and a individual problem.\nThe chat function can be removed by choice, so there's no reason to remove it for everyone. \nThe majority of the community don't have an issue with the chat function. For those who do, either mute it or gets punished for abusing it.\nSo keep using /muteall. But don't recommend something on the behalf of the community. This is more of a personal problem than a global problem. \n\n\n\n\n> [{quoted}](name=dxlegault,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=d7EAn2cq,comment-id=,timestamp=2018-11-12T20:34:52.118+0000)\n>\n\n> Greater rewards for the Honor System\n> I think the relatively new honor system was a great addition to the game and it has motivated some of my friends to actually be respectful of the people that they are playing with.

If games were age restricted, this could help separate the maturity levels of players and could possibly improve the game greatly.\n\nThis is an impossible thing.\nWe're on the internet. The majority of the users don't use their accurate age. Age isn't a factor when it comes to maturity. \nPeople will be people, and they'll act how they please or completely unable to. I've seen 13-year-olds act more mature than 30-year-olds. \n\nSo overall, the only thing I agree with is the Honor.\nHonor is starting off in a great place by impacting ranked, but being honorable could be more encouraging. Due to the fact that the rewards are not all that great. So this idea is a decent one.","replies":[]},{"poster":"breakordoom444","date":"2018-11-13T05:32:56.566+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"but the chat.... how the flying fuck are you suppose to communicate.\n\nalso:\n\n1: age is hard to identify\n\n2: Riot would have to get the \"age\" of every person using their product\n\n3: thats going to take 12 fuck years.\n\n4: people will lie about their age.","replies":[]}]}
