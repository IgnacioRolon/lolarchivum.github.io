I recently have had an error occur multiple times involving the game freezing my computer post loading screen. Champ select and loading go like normal. Once the game loads up, as soon as the first champ is spawning into the game, my computer freezes and makes a weird sound, almost like vibrating. I have even recreated it in a custom game. It has happened to the point that I am currently in the lower priority queue for 10 mins for 5 games. If anybody knows what is causing this or any help please let me know.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-22T22:13:41.754+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This may be an issue with your PC's drivers or hardware, but I wanted to see if you were running Windows 10 and installed some updates recently.","replies":[{"poster":"Unlimited Chill","date":"2016-08-23T00:05:07.733+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes I have but I have seemed to fix it with going to compatibility settings.
