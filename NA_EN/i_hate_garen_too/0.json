When I start, games at a nice clean 200-220 FPS, will drop to around 80 or so about 7 minutes and and like clockwork, at 11:13-16 or so, 10-15FPS.  Got a gaming laptop with a GTX 970M, 16gb of ram and one of the newer intelI7&#039;s.   I can run any other game just fine for hours on end at Ultra but lord league?   Heaven forbid I try to run an almost ten year old game at minimum settings.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-04-27T20:27:27.182+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Definitely not normal, what is the memory use up to at that point?\n\nHave you tried a repair? Also what graphics driver? It may not even be the game itself.","replies":[{"poster":"I Hate Garen Too","date":"2018-04-27T21:09:09.331+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm open to suggestions on what it could  be.  It's been fresh installed three times.  These problems don't happen for ANY OTHER game, literally have Witcher 3 on ultra while I'm watching QT stream at source on my big screen with no issues whatsoever.  Memory is at a solid 50%, give or take.\n\nNo manner of optimization on my end, using the Nvidia boost, shuttdown down unneeded processes, dropping the game to the lowest settings has remedied this.\n\nOn the dot, no matter what's happening, game just screeches to a halt at the same time.   And persists in this way for 6-7 minutes.\n\nEDIT:  Sorry, I'm worked up over this and forgot to actually answer you.   Tried two repairs, three full installs and my drivers are up to the most recent as far as I know.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-04-28T00:31:35.243+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What RAM and CPU usage is it reaching? \n\nWhat are your exact hardware specs, OS/driver versions, and anything else unusual in terms of system mods, AV, ect?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"0 Hogapu","date":"2018-04-27T20:16:04.309+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Always 11:13 ? thats really strange\nhave you tried repairing/uninstalling the game ?
