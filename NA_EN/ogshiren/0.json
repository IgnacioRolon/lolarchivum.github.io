Every time that happens, the client disconnects from the server and I have to begin downloading from 0% again.\n\nIve been trying to download the game for OVER A WEEK, but highest progress Ive gotten to was around 30%. Im forced to leave my computer online every night, but in the morning I always found client has disconnected and download progress reset to 0%. Is there any particular reason why Riot FORCES their users to start downloading again at 0% every time when disconnected from server? Is it ILLEGAL to play League of Legends unless you have an internet connection that lasts without interruption for 800+ minutes? Why is it so difficult to have download progress get saved and resumed where it stopped downloading?\n\nStarted downloading in the morning and the progress is at 9% now. I'm waiting for my internet to hiccup any time soon, so that Riot can kick me back down to 0%.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-27T02:55:31.771+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's unfortunate that our client doesn't have a pause feature and your network keeps having these disconnections, but if your network is losing its connection mid-download there's not a lot we can do from our end except help you troubleshoot.  \n\nFirst I'd try using an ethernet cord instead of wifi, since wireless connections are prone to hiccups like this. If that's not helping run through the steps in the [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) for basic troubleshooting, but do pay close attention to port forwarding and DNS settings.","replies":[]},{"poster":"oGsHireN","date":"2017-09-26T21:02:24.985+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Amazing.
