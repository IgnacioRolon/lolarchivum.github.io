Firstly, make sure that your Windows is totally up to date so it has necessary products to get you updated.\n\nThen, I suggest downloading the [hextech repair tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367) and performing a clean reinstall to fix up any old game files that might not be updating properly to the updated client.\n\nFinally, you'll want to make sure that your operating system is allowing league to scan your game files and make updates.  This is best down by going over each step of the [permissions](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) guide to add League as an exception.  Hope all that helps!","replies":[]}]}
