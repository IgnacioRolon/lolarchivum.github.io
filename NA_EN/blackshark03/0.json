I want to buy Fiora {{champion:114}}  and Riven {{champion:92}} ... **Who is the strongest?**","replies":[{"poster":"MunchCrunchLunch","date":"2016-05-24T17:40:49.874+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yasuo is prob the easiest one to play out of those. riven probably the hardest fiora in the middle.but imo i think tanks with utility are better in the top lane. every time i see one of those champs they end up getting outscaled by a tank or a buriser quite easily. even fiora.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pryzum","date":"2016-05-23T13:25:38.922+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I have played all 3 champions a good amount, and have discovered that each of these champs have the potential to be super impactful...or almost completely obsolete (in terms of damage/role relevancy). \n\nYasuo and Riven seem to struggle the most in a lot of match-ups, but have a high skill-ceiling that is worth reaching.\n\nFiora is similar, but has a safer laning phase and a more dynamic choice of build paths (tanky, bruiser, riven-like build).\n\nPersonally, I find Riven and Yasuo loads more fun to play, but I am still super bad with both of them. However, Fiora is definitely worth a try, and with her somewhat safe and simple laning phase, makes her a good champion to discover strengths with.\n\nLet me know if you have any more specific questions about any of them :D Hope this helps!","replies":[{"poster":"Weiner the Pooh","date":"2016-05-23T18:05:57.784+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yup what this guy said, Fiora is super simple and easy and super duper safe, especially early, just play her. Insta free win, her laning phase is super good, insta win from that point. Super strong levels 1-6. Oh and Yasuo is insanely dificult, if youre from NA, dont even try to play him, ditto for Riven.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"hablo intaliano","date":"2016-05-23T13:03:01.376+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"all 3 are good, riven need most skill of all 3 but is very rewarding but im not sure if s6 suits her.\n\nI would recommend you to play Yasuo because riot buffed him like crazy he is kinda OP the whole s6 at top lane since riot created an own mastery for him called warlords bloodlust, which is very strong with crit. double dmg=double warlords heal.\n\nhttp://champion.gg/statistics/#?roleSort=Top&sortBy=general.overallPosition&order=ascend\n\nAs you can see the midlane designed chmapion Yasuo is Nr 3 Top pick at Toplane just right after the midlane mage ekko,\n(yes lol s6 is fucked up xD.)","replies":[{"poster":"BlackShark03","date":"2016-05-23T13:10:44.716+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok, thanks!","replies":[{"poster":"IronwallJackson","date":"2016-05-23T13:37:50.928+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Please no. The two reasons top lane Yasuo is even a viable top lane pick are the other meta picks and the current state of itemization and the option to build bruiser-esque. With the loss of Trinity Force's crit chance in the coming patch, it'll cease to be a viable item on him, which robs him of early-game survivability. That is his most glaring weakness as a toplaner (followed by his pre-first item power trough).\n\nHe's historically been a risky pick topside because of his poor matchups against other melee champs, and the loss of Trinity will bring that fact back into the spotlight.\n\nPick Fiora instead.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
