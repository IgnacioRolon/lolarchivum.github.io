I had 7779ip and now I have 1479ip, that means Blitzcrank cost me 6300!? I checked my history and I didn&#039;t accidentally purchase anything else, but it says I spend 3150 which is a lie. Can Riot check my purchases and see that I spend 6300ip on Blitz? -.- I would really like a refund.","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2015-05-12T06:49:19.671+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A Double payment bug sometimes happens.
