I was really excited to finally get my Dawnbringer icon/border, but I've stopped receiving quests. Riot, was this intentional? I stopped receiving quests four days ago, and (coincidentally) I reached 270 Order tokens four days ago, (Aka one quest away from getting the 280 reward). Was this intentional? Or is my account just bugged?

So if you can look into the problem i would appreciate it.

I've got your account pulled up to make sure this is right, but it does actually look like you were getting and completing all the available missions. You were able to complete the 2 daily missions each day on the 26th-29th. You haven't gotten missions the past two days because the [**event officially ended on the 29th**](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/featured/events/vs-2017).","replies":[{"poster":"Rukaisho","date":"2017-07-02T16:46:28.530+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh, okay. I was confused, because it said the versus tokens were available until 7/24/17, and I thought that's when the event ended :/ Well, guess who's going to blow all of his tokens on key fragments? {{champion:133}} ~The Quinn Main~","replies":[]}]}]}
