You can't open mid in a game. You gave up mid and told them to push and you won't stop them. You said they can have the base. You can't just give up your lane you have to try to win the game. I would be pissed if my mid fell behind and decided to abandon any chance of winning. On top of that you basically blame it on your jungler. You gotta learn to lane without your jungler helping you because it will happen time and time again. If you get ganked often, don't push up. Also, how can you not avoid dying under turret as fizz? He's gotta be one of the hardest assassins to kill under tower considering he can go untargetable. But I am anivia main so I do understand the frustration of laning against anivia and how punishing she can be with a lead. Doesn't mean you can give up and blame it all on your \"trolling\" jungler.","replies":[{"poster":"Ultrios","date":"2017-08-31T01:35:37.308+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is misleading. I didn't give up or open mid. But between their sup/jg/mid diving me nonstop, and me not dying but being beaten under the turret, I couldn't farm or hold it any longer vs the Anivia.\n\nSo I was asking him to hold the lane while I roamed, or gank, or just hold it while I backed. He wouldn't do any of them. So I tried to roam, and anivia just kept pushing mid and no one tried to stop her.\n\nSo I attempted to roam for a gank on bot lane, and the adc just stood there. My team had, in essence, given up. It was frustrating, but I wasn't being mean. The anivia continued to shove during that entire roam and no one contested it. The jungle was just afk.\n\nIf you could see rest of the chat, you would see our yorick top raging at the adc for not following my gank and at the jungle for not holding my lane, ALONG with our support.\n\nThis game is ridiculous because the jungle and adc were trolling, and the support and top lane were on my side. I never gave up, but I adapted my playstyle to try to win. Meanwhile the anivia/vi were BM'ing.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"KawaiiShroom","date":"2017-08-30T22:04:07.064+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It would to annoying to have you on my team cause you talk too much.
