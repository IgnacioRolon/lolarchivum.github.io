Blind or draft, it happens and they blame the previous adc/support/duo when the game goes wrong (most often jungler).

The jungler asks to switch me for top, fuck it, guy probably sucks at jungle anyway so I switch. At least I try to switch. He never takes off smite so now we have Nasus jungle and I'm Kayn top. He feeds. We lose.\n\n2. They don't ask to switch, but they pick a dumbass champion for their role (support Yorick the most recent). So I offer them top.. You know the place their champ could actually work.. Nope. They just go bot and do nothing. \n\n3. And then we have the classic, the standard \"hey can I top?
