I lost about 50 games and suddenly it clicked. There are many champs I could first time and do way better with. I got better and better, and learned to hard carry with him. Playing rengar was a truly unique experience in LoL. It made me feel like a true hunter/predator/assassin.\r\n\r\nI took a break before the last rengar rework. I came back a few months ago and immediately thought, &quot;I&#039;ll play some trust ol&#039; rengar.&quot; And saw the rework. I gave it about three games and decided I hated everything about it, and it felt nothing at all like the original rengar. There is nothing redeeming about this new shell of a champion.\r\n\r\nHere are my complaints.\r\n\r\n1) his Q just feels terrible. It feels slow and sluggish. It doesn&#039;t do the damage like it used to. Using it to get a little movement jump is so lame. It loses almost all of it&#039;s brutal, visceral impact and doesn&#039;t feel rewarding at all.\r\n\r\n2) his passive is SO bland. I used to love farming the necklace and getting all the perks and they all had distinct advantages that helped in so many ways. I would play games and think, &quot;I need this kill so I can move faster for picks and get longer jumps,&quot; and it really changed the feel and playstyle. Sure the new passive is numerically strong. But boring.\r\n\r\n3) the ultimate is now horrible. This was it, the thrill of the hunt. You get in position, activate, and you are a real predator. You ping, you run in, it was so thrilling. So feral. Now you use it, and enemies start running from SO far off. Sometimes I feel like they would notice me later on if I hadn&#039;t ulted because they wouldn&#039;t get the enormous warning sign. I can elicit more surprise with a rammus Powerball after hitting the exploding plant to leap into a bush even if it&#039;s warded. That is a problem.\r\n\r\nCan&#039;t say I feel much about the w or e has changed, other than the E doesn&#039;t fly mid leap right and is clunky unlike before.\r\n\r\n4) Finally, the nail in the coffin is his ferocity. It used to be a minigame and expression of skill to find creative ways to stack it up in preparation and time your camp kills with everything to be ready for a gank without losing time or too much hp. Now it doesn&#039;t matter because it falls off and it just doesn&#039;t feel as good.\r\n\r\nRengars damage and execution used to feel so fluid and smooth and just good. Now he&#039;s so clunky and sluggish. I feel like the hunted, not the hunter. All the joy of playing what rengar was is gone. I could not bear to play this atrocity. The ultimate is just the worst. It feels so awful. It does not feel at all like it used to. There is nothing I love about it. Nothing like it used to be,&quot;oh baby I&#039;m 6 time to hunt.&quot; Blegh.\r\n\r\nHonestly, I imagine I could get a more rengar feel from playing twitch. Twitch has a better version of rengars ultimate on a short cooldown accessible at level one. What&#039;s more, twitch doesn&#039;t have to take any risks like rengar did to use stealth, he can do more damage than rengar ever did from a screen away at range. Twitch doesn&#039;t give a warning, or have to wait to get access to stealth, or anything like that. I never killed people faster than current fed twitch as a fed rengar. Best case it was a similar kill time. And as rengar I often had to take risks in late game teamfights that twitch never has to take.\r\n\r\nSo why was rengar essentially deleted from the game (current rengar is not the same champ) because he was unhealthy, while twitch remains in a far more unhealthy state untouched for this long?\r\n\r\nAs a neat experiment, I dare you to give twitch the massive rengar warning exclamation and no other changes and see how much that hurts him. I bet it would devastate him.\r\n\r\nReally id just like to enjoy playing rengar again, not this new champ that has taken his place.\r\n\r\nWho&#039;s with me?","replies":[{"poster":"ButterBladesX","date":"2017-09-18T08:53:11.572+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"i feel you! also they did something similar to my bro shaco. his e is garbage. im not too much of a fan of his mini rework. i dont feel like the DEMON jester that he is suppostu be but as a mcdonalds clown :\"({{sticker:cass-cry}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Capta√≠n Insano","date":"2017-09-23T06:03:00.799+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I did the same thing. I was originally hard stuck in low silver. Eventually I found Rengar and fell in love. I played him non-stop. Racking up over 120k mastery on him in a very short time. And climbed to Gold 2 before the season ended. Then. The rework happened. and it was so heartbreaking.

Riot knows it's bad, they've said multiple times that they \"want\" to redo it but no work has been announced. I'm supposed to just sit here and pray that they bring back the thing i loved about the game i've spent so much money on. Frankly if i could get a refund for my account i'd be gone from this piece of shite game.","replies":[]}]}
