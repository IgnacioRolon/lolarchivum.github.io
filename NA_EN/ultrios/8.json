Now were going to nerf black cleaver so it applies stacks slower.\r\n\r\nOH don&#039;t forget, duskblade will be better early but no longer scale so it will be an early game buff, but late game nerf most likely (numbers aren&#039;t final.)\r\n\r\nWe&#039;ere going to make ghostblade give less damage, but more movement speed because that will help assasins burst the ADCs down slower, but they can get to them to die quicker to feed more gold to the ADC god.\r\n\r\nSounds good. Where should I do my bowing to the ADC gods? will it become a 4 ADC one support meta?","replies":[{"poster":"Xintium","date":"2017-06-24T11:05:52.639+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The ''new'' meta:\n{{champion:133}} Top Lane\n{{champion:104}} Jungle\n{{champion:236}} Mid Lane\n{{champion:22}} Bot Lane\n{{champion:21}} Support\n\nYou can find the nearest ADC temple via Google.
