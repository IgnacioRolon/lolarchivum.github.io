I loved him pre-rework, I loved him post rework until they nerfed him into the ground. His passive basically doesn&#039;t exist save for sometimes saving you from one lucky grab.\n\nHe&#039;s always been a late game monster. But I gotta say, I was looking forward to these *malz* buffs and am very disappointed.\n\nMalz has pathetic damage early game right now, especially with the prevalence of shields everywhere. hes got zero mobility, but he can farm safely right? this was his fall back. He could maybe all in at 6 to get fed, he could farm, and he was a late game monster.\n\nHis ult right now is doing just sad, pathetic damage. I don&#039;t know why. The percent max HP dmg on it is VERY VERY low now. It&#039;s like it doesnt&#039; even exist. I know you all thought that it was going to be a big buff, right? Well it used to do ENORMOUS AOE percent max HP damage. Now it does some pretty sad overall damage. Sad. Like the void zone is like a teeny percent max hp damage. And the single target component is pretty sad. So no more AOE and very mediocre damage single target. Bear in mind this is in comparison to other low mobility, high damage mids. His E endgame is doing like 500 damage and its a slow duration DOT. Lets say if we look at xerath, his Q will do 800 damage endgame, and his W hit in the center does similar damage. He's also low mobility, but a lot longer range. Other mids have numbers that are more comparable to xerath.\n\nXeraths ult does something like 500 dmg per shot x 5 endgame. Malz ult will do like 600 damage or something sad. Sure it's got cc/utility. It can just be removed with a QSS. Well xerath also has a stun and a huge slow. ANd gobs more damage.\n\nMalz's E damage is just troll. The 10 percent scaling they gave it is a joke. Its a very small amount of damage that might help late game. But nof if there are Shields everywhere (and there are). You're lucky if this does even one damage on the carry you&#039;re targeting. It will do some damage to whatever shield is on him but that's about it.\n\nThe big kicker is that his W dies in one fart. Every champion in the game. Every teamfight. Someone farted and all your voidlings just died. No ifs, no ands, no buts. This means you basically DO NOT HAVE A W ABILITY. You are a champion with 3 abilities. You can press it if you want. They made it so you cant cast it at range, so you cast it, it appears next to you, and kind of waddles on over. It may or may not make it to the champion, then it falls over with whatever gust of wind killed it. One, two, or three. It doesn&#039;t matter how many you summoned. They&#039;re dead before they hit anything. Youre lucky if they get one autoattack off. Why even waste mana on this right now? Anything aoe kills them all instantly.\n\nSO youre looking at a champion with a passive that is so overnerfed that it really doesn&#039;t do anything until the end of the game, and then every once in awhile it will block a lucky grab or something if you are bad or don&#039;t see something. His E damage does over time what any other ability in the game, point or click or not, does instantly. THe base damage is just sad.\n\nHis Q is insanely hard to hit now with that enormous delay on it. ANd even if you do manage to hit it, the INTERRUPT is tiny, and the damage is pathetic. It might do 600 damage. good luck hitting with it now, though. IDK guys, this is bad I think. Maybe I&#039;m bad I guess. Low damage Q that is hard to hit, VERY short range E that does tiny damage and is a dot with teeny tiny damage, and his ult does sad damage now. His W doesn't even exist unless they quadruple the voidlings HP. They are just there to give free gold to whoever happens to blow them over first.","replies":[{"poster":"ChaddyFantome","date":"2017-06-01T18:55:56.131+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"his ultimate shouldn't really be  doing all that much damage for the amount of power a point and click ranged suppress has to be fair.","replies":[]}]}
