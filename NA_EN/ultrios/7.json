I&#039;ve been spamming him a few times today and yesterday in my free time. Normaly I&#039;d just play darkin every game, but I&#039;m trying to get my ONE WIN with SA kayn in normals and it is incredibly painful. It makes me say, &quot;darn I HATE playing SA kayn.&quot;\r\n\r\nWhile darkin kayn is fun to play and thematically I love him and he feels solid in certain circumstances (I wouldn&#039;t call him strong), I feel like shadow assassin Kayn is just awful.\r\n\r\nFirst off, when jungling you have to max Q really for clear speed (I think?) The problem here is that in shadow assassin, your q does low damage compared to the W and gets no bonus effects. Also as SA, you will likely have few resists or tank stats so Q is a risky all in move that may kill you. I think forcing his jungle clear to rely on Q max is a problem here with shadow assassin kayn.\r\n\r\nThe passive on darkin Kayn is awesome. The passive on SA Kayn just feels very weak. I can hardly tell it&#039;s there. Frankly, it&#039;s almost always too risky to just all in from the start. So what happens is, your SA passive almost always just gives your W a little bonus damage as you try to skirmish or poke with it, and then goes on cooldown. It&#039;s pretty weak it seems.\r\n\r\nSA Kayn gets a bonus effect to his E. To be honest, I really don&#039;t notice it at all. It won&#039;t change or improve your teamfight AT ALL. It may help you in the laning phase get some ganks off, which is probably almost over by the time you transform anyways. So while darkin kayn gets a knockup on his W which is insanely good, and his Q gets huge damage, and he gets drain tank stats on his passive to use those abilities, SA kayn gets no cc, no sustain passive, no damage on his Q, and his E gets buffed which by the time you get it won&#039;t see a ton of usefulness in it&#039;s current state during teamfights.\r\n\r\nThen on the ultimate, darkin kayn gets a big percent damage heal and does percent max dmg HP which is just better than the pathetic damage SA kayn in every way.\r\n\r\nSA Kayn feels incredibly shafted. Literally the only thing he gets over the other form is slightly better damage and better map mobility. I wouldn&#039;t call the W trade a win, since darkin gets a knockup. Darkin has the better passive, Q, W, and R. And that&#039;s not really up for debate as far as I can tell.\r\n\r\nHow to fix? More damage somewhere on his ultimate, and better utility in the form of escape or teamfight with his E. If you don&#039;t want to make his ultimate useful somehow, then mobility/damage on his Q in SA form.\r\n\r\nmy thoughts anyways.","replies":[{"poster":"Omnem Occido","date":"2017-07-13T14:29:37.192+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wait, what?
