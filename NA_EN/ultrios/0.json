But I can&#039;t help wondering.\r\n\r\nRIOT has taken a zero tolerance policy on certain key words and phrases. There&#039;s no need for me to mention them here as I&#039;m sure we can all guess or are aware of what they are.\r\n\r\nThese words genuinely should not be allowed. I agree.\r\n\r\nSo why doesn&#039;t RIOT simply disable the words from chat? It would take them a few minutes to program it and they could just not allow the words to be typed, or just auto censor them. Preferably just don&#039;t allow them to be typed so people can&#039;t guess the context.\r\n\r\nIf they truly believe and care about their zero tolerance policy, and they should, then why not just take matters into their own hands and prevent those words from being used?\r\n\r\nRIOT has the ability and power here to do this very easily. If they want to protect their young customers and players from being exposed to this filth, don&#039;t they have an obligation to just prevent these key trigger words from ever being used? Am I crazy here? This can all be solved with very little effort. So why not just solve it?\r\n\r\nAm I wrong? Can someone explain?\r\n\r\nYou could make the argument that people should be better and RIOT is trying to teach people to reform but it&#039;s not RIOTs job to do this. Or at least it&#039;s not their top priority. The top priority should be protecting their clients, and this can be done by simply not allowing the use of certain words to enter the chat. \r\n\r\nI can&#039;t think of any CONs here other than you want people to improve by their own volition, but protecting others is paramount and possible here. There&#039;s no need to expose anyone to these words even once.\r\n\r\nRIOT stop allowing it? I&#039;m sure everyone would thank you.","replies":[{"poster":"TrulyBland","date":"2017-11-24T15:31:51.084+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Think of one of those really easy to do hate speech filters. Try to imagine how you would implement it.\nThink it through.\n\nNow ask yourself whether it would block a word comprised of characters such as ∃, 9, |,  И, or Я.\n\nShouldn't take you long to figure out what word you can write with those... also shouldn't take you long to realize that there are a **lot** more ways to do this. This was literally the first way that came to mind to replace literally all characters with similar looking ones.\nHumans are creative and they are good at quickly recognizing patterns. Those two things in combination make it virtually impossible to ban specific words from chat.\n\nAnd the next issue arises that if you somehow magically **do** figure out all how to properly censor all variations of hate speech, you are bound to run into problems like one that I saw recently, where somebody tried to warn his team that the enemy Pantheon is going to try to destroy the team nexus... just to have \"pan is\" be censored by Riot's filter and make the rest of the sentence fairly confusing to read.\n\nSo, yeah, there are indeed very easy and quick ways to program a filter like this... but I cannot come up with any one that has enough sensitivity to be actually effective and enough specificity to warrant being permanently switched on.","replies":[]},{"poster":"mosaickle","date":"2017-11-24T08:13:39.305+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's too diverse, and their zero tolerance doesn't mean they don't want it happening directly, but rather they'll punish those who do.\nIt's like how free speech should be allowed by anyone, but what you do with that free speech is up to your own risk.","replies":[{"poster":"Ultrios","date":"2017-11-24T08:22:35.788+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Too diverse? Sure people can find crafty ways to cheat the system. But at least you can prevent others from being hurt by the big hitters. That list is fairly short and easy to remove.\n\nEverything else can be picked up by the other systems.\n\nI guess I'm of a mindset they're obligated to do everything in their power to protect their clients.\n\nI can see zero benefits from allowing the key hate speech words, and I feel like RIOT is on board here as everyone else should be. So doesn't RIOT have an obligation to protect their players?\n\nJust disabling the big words from being typed into chat could protect someone. The act of disabling them is incredibly resource cheap and comes with zero negative side effects.\n\nSo why not do it?\n\nAlso I guess I'd you're going to punish people that do something that should mean you don't want that thing happening directly so I don't follow your logic. And this is very different from free speech.","replies":[{"poster":"Magical Player","date":"2017-11-24T08:52:05.639+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Problem with making a ban list\nis the same issue with prohibition\npeople literally go out of their way to continue doing shit","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Taeseuk","date":"2017-11-24T10:15:43.384+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While this could be done,  there are a few reasons it's not. \n\nThey already have a chat filter for their younger players that you have to manually turn off. \n\nPeople will always purposefully find a way around the filter and it will make it more work for riot to go through all the cases they get. \n\nIt in theory helps the player vase over time, the people that say these kinds of things are usually very toxic and there for can be removed quicker making the player base have to deal with less of it each time.","replies":[]},{"poster":"General Esdeath ","date":"2017-11-24T09:15:51.752+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pretty sure it's censored in game already and replaced with %","replies":[]},{"poster":"Basura Nephilim","date":"2017-11-24T08:18:35.545+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"If i'm a racist, I can go and N bomb you.\nWhen Riot bans the word, i'll make up a new word.

It's not my job, nor Riots to change who people are. You can silence them however. And that's counter productive in most cases.","replies":[]}]}
