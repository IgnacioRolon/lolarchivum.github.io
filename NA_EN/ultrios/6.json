It just takes too long to transform for solo queue.\r\n\r\nSure I like to play him too. I feel kind of guilty when I do, because I know my team gets tilted at just seeing the selection. This isn&#039;t the pros. It means no good ganks for 15 minutes. It means no help is coming if you are countered or lose your lane. It means you&#039;re going to lose the laning phase and be massively behind going into the late game.\r\n\r\nIt means the only way your team is securing a kill via gank is if your laner brings CC AND the enemy laner doesn&#039;t have escape.\r\n\r\nWhen your team sees you haven&#039;t transformed by 16+ minutes it just hurts. It happens all too often. I see many Kayn players with great farm but that are outdamaged by supports like Lulu at the end of the game. Just a really bad idea in his current iteration.\r\n\r\nIt means you will have no pressure on the map unless you win your lane and even then, you need one of your other lanes to win and that means SOLO win. I honestly see more ganks, early ganks, and more effective ganks from the likes of master yi. Am I alone here?","replies":[{"poster":"The Leo Cat","date":"2017-07-30T19:54:45.295+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"outside of the transformation problem... It kinda seems like you're stating the normal problems of playing Jungler.\n\nTo easily secure a kill as a jungler alone in a gank, you need to be able to jump on top of the enemy fast. It doesn't matter if you have CC if you can't actually get to em. Only a few Junglers can actually do this and it is a skill shot. And unless you are Vi or Zak, you're probably not killing em alone if you do have CC. The other exception is Lee Sin vs a really squishy laner. This is why it's important that the LANER has CC.","replies":[]}]}
