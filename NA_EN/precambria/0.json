I have tried connecting directly to my modem, flush dns and set the game to high priority on my network before I call my ISP and unleash the fury I am wondering if there is something going on with your servers or any explanation aside from my ISP experiencing problems (seeing as it is only this game that is affected I doubt it).\r\n\r\n I'm worried because last time this started happening it stayed that way for 2 seasons.. when you moved your server it was instantly fixed, I have also moved within the same area since than and seen a further decrease in ping (same ISP), whats going on ;_;","replies":[{"poster":"RiotBok","date":"2016-05-25T00:12:13.170+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have you tried all the steps in the [Connection Troubleshooting](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664) guide?
