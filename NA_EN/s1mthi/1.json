Some things i saw while it was attempting to reconnect was that the **minions were messed up, some standing still, not moving, others shooting at the wall or at an enemy minion not taking damage**, and on my minimap, **not a single champion would show up** (if they were dead they were stuck on a 0 sec cooldown) and **everyone was level 1 even though it was mid game** (i was teleporting backwards too if i was moving somewhere, or it wouldn't let me move at all). During this entire match, **my curse call with my friends continued on** just fine and I could watch youtube videos as well while attempting to reconnect. I've also been experiencing this problem with other games as well. Not only this, but I always join the champ select lobby a few seconds after everyone has accepted the match. Is there anything i can do to fix this?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-09T21:46:09.369+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your post indicates that you're most likely experiencing heavy packet loss and packet buffering.

At the suggested link, there was nothing under the results for packet buffering or packet loss. On netalyzr the only things that kept showing up were: \n\nDirect UDP access to remote L2 tunneling servers (port 1701) is blocked. \n\nYour ISP's DNS resolver follows CNAMEs regardless of their location. This is very unusual. \n\n3 popular names have a moderate anomaly: we are unable to find a reverse name associated with the IP address provided by your ISP's DNS server, although we expected to find a name. This is most likely due to a slow responding DNS server. If you rerun Netalyzr and see this condition remain, it could be due to a misconfiguration on the part of the domain owner, deliberate blocking using DNS, or your DNS server could be misconfigured or enabling a Man-in-the-Middle attack.\n\n\nName |                                         IP Address      |       Reverse Name/SOA\n\nmail.yahoo.com             |          98.139.21.169   |    X \nsmartzone.comcast.net    |     68.87.20.7       |      X \nwww.yahoo.com               |       98.139.180.149  |  X \n","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-10T15:24:27.640+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since you're still encountering issues, I recommend reaching out to our tech specialists in a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).
