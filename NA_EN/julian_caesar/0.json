It said 80 which was acceptable, but it still lagged! Unacceptable!!! I knew it wasnt me because google was working fine. I tried to exit out of the client and restart it only to find that it wont even log me in again! I guess it's fine now because I'm probably not going to play again, but I just want to let Riot know that they need to start fixing their servers and stop make innocent players suffer.
