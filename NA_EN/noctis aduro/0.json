I enjoy my skin and all its effect however there is one thing I&#039;m not enjoying. Whenever I Enter a game as Omega and there&#039;s a regular {{champion:17}}  on the other team, Sometimes Teemo&#039;s Omega quotes are replaced with classic Teemo&#039;s quote.\r\n\r\nNow I don&#039;t know if this is intentional or a script bug, but I would enjoy it if the little glitch was repaired, its not the end of the world if its not and I honestly would care less if it wasn&#039;t. But I know that in order to improve upon games, the community needs to report glitches otherwise it prevents the game from evolving and becoming greater than it already is.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-06-02T23:45:52.612+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Noctis Aduro - \n\nThanks for the report! This is definitely a bug and not something that's intended.
