Throughout the summer I have used this great game as an escape for me. The interesting thing is sometimes I wouldn&#039;t play the game when I went away to escape from the real world. As the summer went on and school started I managed to read every champion&#039;s lore and as a sort of self project I decided to try to connect them in ways that the regular lore wouldn&#039;t say. On Riot&#039;s league website you can look at every champions lore and see their friends and rival&#039;s. Some of these relationships make no sense and I and many others recognized this. But, to find their relation&#039;s I had to look around and I stumbled across the AMAZING thing called the JoJ also know as Journals of Justice. In this 31 page newspaper for the citizens or Runeterra it showed it relationships between the champs I&#039;ve been looking for. Now when the League collapsed on itself they ended it which saddens me extremely. But while reading this it made me extremely happy. I am hoping a riot employee reads this because of the love I have for this game and lore. But, if you read the whole Journals of Justice at the end Katarina and Jarvan team up and bring down the league due to there involvement in all of the conflicts that have been arising. In blitzcranks dating service it matched up Garen and Katarina. This was because they both sought to protect the interests of their respected city-states. After reading this it expanded my mind and made me feel like i was their. And if you read the Journals it says how Ram Steed was stabbed repeatedly by Shaco and then later in the Journal&#039;s it says how Garen and his squadron cornered someone who was retrieving left over objects from the assassination&#039;s. They cornered the person and the he disappeared. That is his Deceive ability. He also left over knives. Shaco&#039;s favorite. And someone might ask Talon could&#039;ve done it. Well talon took orders from NO ONE except Katarina&#039;s dad who recently disappeared. So Talon wouldn&#039;t have poisoned anyone. \r\n\r\n\r\nSo anyway people you have to realize how much this company loves us. They don&#039;t hand info to us because they want us to explore it all!!!! So Riot Games or Rito Games I don&#039;t really know what you like more, if there was another article that is in the process of being made or is being made or isn&#039;t completely I highly suggest you do another one of these. The reason I right these articles isn&#039;t because I&#039;m bored or have nothing to do but I love being attached to something that captures my mind. So anyway this is Cyromo signing off.

You shoulda been on the old forums then, boy was that hellfire.\n\nNow, every so often someone new discovers the old lore and posts simuliar sentiments as to yours. Sad conclusion is that Riot pulled the life cord from its lore around the release date of Jayce (No champion since mentions the Instatute of War or summoners). The official anouncement of the lore ret con came years later but it was all superficial since the lore was long decided on.\n\nThe new lore is great, dont get me wrong, but it is only tiny sprinkles on a massive cake. The IoW and summoners were your plot, it was nearly your whole world.\n\nWill the JoJ or something simuliar come back? Doubtful. The few lore nerds are overwhelmed by all those that only care to watch another Korean team win worlds by boringly fight turrets while trying not to lane vs each other for 20 minutes.  :/","replies":[{"poster":"RiotJaredan","date":"2015-11-21T21:43:07.026+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":4,"body":"The JoJ isn't coming back, I'm afraid.

I know that the JoJ is done with and you don't intend on bringing it back but instead want to focas on lore's.

It's taken us longer than we hoped, but we're making strides to bring high quality story and characters to players at a regular cadence. We feel we are progressing well on quality for pure story (and, personally, I also think Champ Team has been knocking it out of the park in regard to new champs), but we have some way to go yet in that area, as well as a lot to do to ensure a strong cadence.\n\nWe hope you join us on our journey.

I don't even consider the new lore properly started until this happens.\n\n>We feel we are progressing well on quality for pure story (and, personally, I also think Champ Team has been knocking it out of the park in regard to new champs),\n\nI'll agree. The quality of your writing has gone up immensely, it's great.\n\nIn overarching philosophies however, I wouldn't know. You don't seem too eager to discuss or even talk about these, unlike for example the gameplay team in their patch notes.\nWith overarching philosophies I mean the big-picture reasoning.\nFor examples:\n\n* Do you treat the new world as a new world, or as the old one, but without IoW (Fairly sure it's just considered a new world).\n* What is ok to retcon, besides the announced retconning of IoW, summoners and immersion. Individual stories that make sense even without IoW? Big events? Small events? Champions?\n* How connected do you want the world to be.\n* How many storylines should be actively ongoing at a time.\n* How often will stories be connected/merged, is there an endgame.\n* Will big real-world-event-related events be coming back yearly, or perhaps slower.\n\nI understand you can't talk about some of these due to spoilers, but I haven't seen discussions about anything like these. The only discussions narrative has started have been on specific instances. I seem to just be supposed to blindly trust you that you discuss these philosophies internally and make wise decisions. \n\nThis is an issue though, I no longer trust narrative.\n\nI don't know whether narrative is critical of its own actions. Whether narrative cares for or even knows the old lore and the old characters. I've no clue how many of the threads about story are being read and how many go ignored. I've reasons to distrust Riot in this aspect, and a couple of reasons to trust, but having one of my favorite champions blatantly removed with some awful reasoning to back it up is just too much.\n\n>We hope you join us on our journey. I think it's going to be very much worthwhile (I am biased).\n\nEh. I'll read it. Don't want to get too invested though. For I too am biased, but sadly I'm biased the wrong way.\n\n***\n\nJaredan, I do appreciate you answering, and know that I don't mean any of these complaints to you or any narrative member personally. All the Rioters I've seen on the forums seem like nice people.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Photos of Ghosts","date":"2015-11-22T10:53:07.507+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"IMPORTANT QUESTION\nwill the new client that will soon go in Alpha allow us to se the full champion introductions?
