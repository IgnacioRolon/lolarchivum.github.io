Wasted several relic procs trying to clear them from base and since we all know that they dont give gold it was a huge waste.\n\nThanks.\n\nEDIT: WHY CAN NASUS GET STACKS FROM IT.","replies":[{"poster":"MrRazzleDazzle","date":"2016-03-13T15:08:26.498+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Played Zac top against Garen. He rushed Zz'rots because of course he did. I have my minion wave pushed to the mid lane. He ults me just slightly in front of my turret, popping my passive and lays down the portal in the bush. As my passive sloooowly inched toward combining, the minions spawned from the portal come in range of the turret and get zapped, but not before hitting my blobs. Garen is just spamming laugh while minions take me out and there's nothing I can do.\n\nThis is the most rekt I have ever felt.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ariel the Cruel","date":"2016-03-13T04:47:42.661+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":">EDIT: WHY CAN NASUS GET STACKS FROM IT.\n\nZz'Rot bugs aren't anything special in this respect, actually.\nSusan gets stacks from killing *anything*.\nMinions, champions, jungle mobs, structures, Bugs, Tentacles, etc.","replies":[{"poster":"TTVSushiDevourer","date":"2016-03-13T04:48:48.139+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol it just feels accelerated haha","replies":[{"poster":"Ariel the Cruel","date":"2016-03-13T05:37:20.259+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you want accelerated, play Illaoi against him.\nNo point in even leveling her E.

The thing with the gold is that it could become abused.  They would have to then go through and limit the portal to X minions spawning from it to cut down gold that could be earned from it.  It would probably be somewhat difficult also to code them to not trigger mushrooms because im guessing they are just coded as a minion with a value of 0.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Spoofghoul","date":"2016-03-13T11:58:28.348+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Sushi Devourer,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=yeIhlyAb,comment-id=,timestamp=2016-03-12T20:57:58.912+0000)\n>\n> EDIT: WHY CAN NASUS GET STACKS FROM IT.\n\nExtra edit why doesnt it help sion get stacks","replies":[]},{"poster":"theArtifacts","date":"2016-03-13T00:28:29.639+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think they should have gold on them as that gives the enemy the opportunity to farm them for way more gold.
