While watching LCS this weekend i noticed that there is no indicator of what Keystone the players are running.  While in some cases you can tell when you see a thunderlords proc or the caster points something out about the mastery, we have no other idea of what keystone is being used.  With Keystones being a huge part of League right now i believe it would be a good idea for Riot to show which Keystone is being used by the players during LCS/LPL/LCK etc.  Yes, we all know that a majority of champions are using Thunderlords, but with hopeful nerfing and buffing of masteries this will change and other Keystones will become very relevant.  \r\nThanks everyone for stopping by!","replies":[{"poster":"Maszii","date":"2016-01-19T00:29:52.304+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thunderlords","replies":[{"poster":"ayNigerianPrince","date":"2016-01-19T19:03:03.955+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When I opened the thread I was certain the first post would be nothing but the word \"Thunderlords\".

Tanky Supports are grabbing Bond of Stone. the Mage Support types as mentioned above, are taking Thunderlord's\n* There are a few exceptions though. In Immortals vs Team Impulse of W1D2, Immortals' Bot lane did take some alternatives. WildTurtle took Thunderlord's on Corki and Adrian took Windspeaker's Blessing on Janna","replies":[{"poster":"TTVSushiDevourer","date":"2016-01-19T15:11:23.244+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"And i believe that would be the best part of the indicator!

Lee Sin get's that 40% ASPD boost for two autos after using an ability. Considering, that both portions of Lee Sin's Q deals Damage, that's 4 stacks right away, 4 more from the double AA hit, and he still has an E for more damage and the Slow, and of course the R. \n\n In other words, in about 1 or 2 seconds, Lee Sin will have the Max 8 stacks when he comes to gank the enemy. And of course his ability to pull off twitch reflex jukes with W, Re-engage with Q again since you have a 6 second window to hit an enemy champion again.\n\nTL:DR version: Lee Sin get's it for the same reason someone like Master Yi does, Quick and Easy max stacks.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Stillname","date":"2016-01-18T21:26:15.399+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree that it would be nice to see them during the game but if you are curious you can currently check them out after the game by going to the \"esports\" page and clicking on the game you want to see for example http://www.lolesports.com/en_US/na-lcs/na_2016_spring/matches/regular_season/TSM-vs-CLG\n\nThen you go to the \"view player builds and stats\" which brings you to a page like you would see in your own match history http://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/TRLH1/1001520070?gameHash=e5a089b1818d40b0&tab=overview\n\nFrom there you can click \"player builds\" and select each champion to see what masteries they had that game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"K0zmonaut","date":"2016-01-18T23:50:30.967+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like the idea, but if you really want to know just go to the game statistics after it's over","replies":[{"poster":"TTVSushiDevourer","date":"2016-01-19T00:13:16.201+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Totally agree.
