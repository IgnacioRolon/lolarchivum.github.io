Please note this is just a theory.\r\n\r\nOld Cass happened to have the combination of strengths that Riot absolutely hates.\r\n\r\nA) Poke\r\nB) Speed Boost\r\nC) Slows\r\nD) good damage per second\r\n\r\nBefore you go typing in the comments that Cass doesn't have many slows I'd like to point out that she uses {{item:3116}} ridiculously well... possibly better than anyone else in the game.  Now lets take a look at how her rework kinda ruined most of those strengths.\r\n\r\nA) Q's AP ratio got trashed and its cooldown increased by 1 second.  W lost over half its base damage.  Deadly Cadence used to allow for a lot more casts of her poke before going OOM.\r\n\r\nB) the raw numbers for the speed boost is... well its better at early ranks worse at late ranks so... neutral right?  No.  Q has a 4 second cooldown now and the speed boost still lasts 3 seconds when they used to match.  What makes it worse is that Riot gives Cass 25% CDR at 250 stacks.  That means you can't build CDR early to get back to perma speed boost status.  You have to wait until the point of the game that Riot thinks it is ok for Cass to have that again.\r\n\r\nC) The 30% AP amp kinda makes you really want to rush all the 120 AP items instead of {{item:3116}}.  Also rank one of W got a 5 second cooldown increase.  Granted W did get a 10% stronger slow on all ranks but I'm not sure that helps a whole lot.\r\n\r\nD) This is the only one of those strengths that didn't get reduced.\r\n\r\nThe final part is she got turned into a hyper carry.  That means that early game she probably isn't going to want to chase anyone even if her kit still allowed her to do it.\r\n\r\nNow why Riot hates that combination of strengths I haven't a clue.  I also haven't a clue why they STILL haven't just come out and told us specifically why they changed Cass the way they did.","replies":[{"poster":"5G8Nri0B54","date":"2014-12-28T21:24:51.883+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":2,"body":"The alternative explanation he gave earlier was *\"doing DoT made Cassiopeia step on Brand's toes because he has a Passive that also dealt DoT\"*","replies":[{"poster":"Penguin Eclipse","date":"2014-12-28T21:41:33.085+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Ginga,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=euwozeA8,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2014-12-28T21:24:51.883+0000)\n>\n> The alternative explanation he gave earlier was *\"doing DoT made Cassiopeia step on Brand's toes because he has a Passive that also dealt DoT\"*\n\nFunny thing is Cass was a DoT mage before Brand was even released.

Her play pattern and kit still support a lane bully playstyle thanks to her excellent range and the intrinsic zoning in her Twin Fang + ult, but their efforts to make her fit into the late game were literally just \"make her do more damage late game\". She's still an excellent duelist and poor team fighter, i.e a poor hyper carry and excellent laner. \n\nOne of the many problems with the rework is that they didn't actually help any of her problems in team fights outside of giving her a bit of sustain to mean she blows up slower. Her ult is still unreliable, her AOE DOT (main team fight strength) is now worthless... in a team fight she's a more conditional ADC.

Using her W for damage is a huge risk since it's her escape; she doesn't have the 100-0 potential of an assassin (at least until late game), so you have to be really freaking sure that you can get the reset faster than the enemy can kill you.

She's not horrifically weak in lane, she's no Vayne, but she's certainly not Lucian or Draven or something. Champions aren't balanced in a vacuum.

Not because they aren't interactive, but because they have the ability to *deny interaction*.

But her 1% pick rate and 0 % banrate suggest that she wasn't.\n\nI played the old Cass a lot. I certainly don't remember this no-interaction play style you speak of. Indeed she could do really well in lane. She could also do really bad because she had a ton of counters.","replies":[{"poster":"Enraged Piglet","date":"2014-12-29T05:38:06.037+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"what most people don't understand is almost every champion sounds broken op when you state there abilities like that.
