Its eating at me. How do I kill this emotion. Its not fun nor is it nice. Its terrible. I have tried not caring but it always comes back eating at me. I tried focusing on school work, league of legends, and work to keep my mind off of it. But as soon as I hear her fucking name or remember the memories I shared with her. It comes back at me. Like a fucking train going 170 miles per minute straight into a fucking wall. How do I kill this feeling. How do I stop this piece of shit heart from caring. I dont need this fucking feeling its affecting my school work and my work. The fuck do I do. This feeling its something that I have no need for. How do I get rid of it. Someone help me here. I want her out of my fucking mind. This feeling is worse than elo hell. At least when Im in elo hell I can deal with it and get out of it. But this fucking feeling no matter how many years or months or days go by its still there. Creeping on me. Reminding me of her. I want this emotion dead. How do I kill it. I tried over and over again to forget her but It always comes back everytime. I guess I should have been mutual and kept things straight with her. But no I had to make a move. And now here I am suffering the consequences. I just need this feeling dead I cant focus on school or on my work with this feeling creeping on me.  \r\n\r\nI just want things to go back the way they were. I want my depressing lonely life back. It was so much better and manageable. Could focus on school without a worry. Lived my life without making any contact with society. Kept to myself. Lived under a rock without anyone caring. I want that life back. I wish I didnt met her. She ruined my life. Funny thing is she doesnt even live in the USA. I met her during a vacation. \r\n\r\nI hate this feeling it eats at my heart. \r\n\r\nHow do I kill this pathetic feeling.","replies":[]}
