So, for me this 14-day ban has side swiped me. If I can appeal this decision please point me to the appropriate tribunal. If one was to go through ALL my text logs, then you would find that much of what I text is extremely sympathetic and helpful. This time was an exception. I acknowledge that my word usage could be deemed offensive, but I'm not sure what exactly escalated my punishment straight to a 'final' waning 14day ban.\r\n\r\nHere is MY unfiltered chat log (keep in mind that there was someone giving it to me just as bad as I gave it to them):\r\n\r\n\r\n> Game 1\r\n> In-Game\r\n> Toxicotton: 700k mastery on Yas?\r\n> Toxicotton: how many yeas is that?\r\n> Toxicotton: *years/seasons\r\n> Toxicotton: well, no shit\r\n> Toxicotton: ty\r\n> Toxicotton: they could see you\r\n> Toxicotton: ahi was oaming down\r\n> Toxicotton: :(\r\n> Toxicotton: rr wouldn't go off\r\n> Toxicotton: sorry, I hate Bork on ashe\r\n> Toxicotton: because of the bork\r\n> Toxicotton: no\r\n> Toxicotton: omg I'm sorry, fuck opff\r\n> Toxicotton: tell me how to do it right %%%%%%s\r\n> Toxicotton: kys\r\n\r\n\r\nNotice how there are NO other instances of this kinda behavior from me. I'm just looking for clarification as the ban doesn't explicitly describe my fallacy.  Also, I wish there were timestamps to indicated when text weer posted in relation to the game.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time, ToxInco.","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2020-01-06T06:23:48.547+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Racist slurs and encouragement of self-harm are \"zero tolerance\" phrases, which means that they can escalate your punishment right to a 14-day suspension without 10-game and 25-game chat restrictions.

I have reported someone for it, he was still playing days after. I even made a ticket after seeing he was playing freely. In fact I have reported a player for the literal n word, and another the acronym of ForGeT and both were still playing days after. These words likely increase your ban meter by 90% and if it finds any soft toxic chat or hate word attached to your account in that match or your history, it triggers the ban. So perhaps these guys said the f and k and n words for the first time time or never were even soft toxic before or during the game. Idk about the F and K guys' team chat because they were in the enemy team and malding to be humiliated by a lane {{champion:76}}. The N word guy did not say much besides that, he was just being an edgelord, it was in Odyssey, so it was not during segregation era, yet he roamed freely.\nIt is definitely why OP got banned instantly, but I just let you know, although it is ultra high risk of ban, the \"no exception\" is false.","replies":[{"poster":"DuskDaUmbreon","date":"2020-01-06T10:58:47.361+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"How long ago was this?

And while I have no problem with mitigating bullying in an online public 'forum', I do raise issue with the notion that the wider context was never considered. Like Youtube, Riot has lazily defaulted to guilty until proven innocent (and Riot is ALWAYS right [even when they're wrong and have to settle MILLIONS in lawsuits due to unfair treatment of their female employees]) and have enforced a super rigid set of guidelines that people have to agree to before playing their game. I get that. That's just the industry.\n\nBut it creates an unfair bias for trolls to berate summoners, then turn around and cry foul because they know how to play the system. If the whole context of the last 3mins of dialogue were released, then it would be much harder to simply say 'I was solely in the wrong and I did it out of Malice.\" So, should I report the Yas (that was on my own team) that told me to uninstall the game because I was trash or the WW that flamed me as 'being r%%%%%ed'. Their words. not mine. So I retaliated during the last seconds...even saying sorry amongst my slew of insults. But were they given a 14-day ban? how would I know? Where's the catharsis in know that we're all held to the same standard rather than given the impression that I alone am the one to be punished, and they few of you kind enough to respond only have to say, \"ya kinda lucked out there my dude.\" \n\nI'm not mad at any of you. I respect your QUICK feedback. BUT! I am flabbergasted by how extreme the measures seem given how I've ALWAYS been as helpful as possible to my teammates, and how I've continued my support and expressed my love of the game year in and year out.

Those who were permabanned for it, had worked their way up to permabans. Zero tolerance phrases like that are an automatic 14 day ban, not perma.

I'm not expecting mercy from them, but it would be neat if we could all get recruited in a chat room to  apologize for our toxicity.
