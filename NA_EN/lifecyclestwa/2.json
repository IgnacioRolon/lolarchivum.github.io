This is not an all purpose build, everything in this game is situational, but Sunfire Abyssal and Sorc boots are core. Buy Elixir of Iron with extra gold.\n\nAnd before you open your mouths about \"omg no revolver\" you only need revolver during the laning phase, if you have a spell-vamp item 30-40 minutes into the game you sir have no clue how to play Mordekaiser as the spell vamp items fall off hard late in the game. So yeah, buy a fucking revolver and replace it later if you have to.\n\nNow rain on me, go cry about it. I guarantee none of you are going to try it though, and I guarantee everyone who is going to critique me and has been critiquing me has not played this champ even 1/10th as much as I have. Instead, you guys are going to devise some master-plan to rework a champion you don&#039;t have a single fucking clue about. Continue building a melee champion with no CC or gap closer glass cannon and QQ more about him needing a rework.\n\nDeuces, and sorry for the salt ;]","replies":[{"poster":"Laughing Fish","date":"2015-05-09T19:46:56.028+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Downvoted for the attitude. \nhttp://i.minus.com/ibmSqyKNilDCbn.gif","replies":[{"poster":"LifeCyclesTWA","date":"2015-05-09T19:47:53.059+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Upvoted for the honesty and the hilarious meme.

I must say, it's quite a bit better than glass cannon Morde. Being able to do roughly the same amount of damage as before (with Mpen instead of AP) while being tanky as hell is pretty surprising. Turns out it doesn't matter how much damage you have when you're dead, and thus why full AP Morde isn't working out.\n\nAnd as you mentioned before, Morde's AP ratios are really lackluster for a burst mage. DFG helped people force him into that role, but now that's it's gone he can't burst well anymore. However, what he does have is really nice base damages, which means Mpen is a natural match. Hopefully Riot won't completely wreck this build with their {{item:3001}} modifications.\n\nI think the reason most people load him down with tons of AP is because no one plays him, so they just never notice the less than spectacular ratios on him.\n\nHowever, calling him \"tank\" Morde is a bit of a misnomer. Tanks have initiation and/or CC in addition to their ability to live a long time. I'd say he's more of an tanky AP bruiser along the lines of {{champion:27}} {{champion:50}}, due to his high damage output and ability to survive quite a long time in melee. You probably wouldn't want to be the team's main tank with him, but you can if need be. Best case scenario is that you're the off-tank, protecting your squishies or going after theirs while the main tank does his thing.\n\nOverall, I feel like this build has the potential to replace the old DFG full AP Morde build in effectiveness.","replies":[{"poster":"LifeCyclesTWA","date":"2015-05-10T18:27:48.278+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been preaching this build for a while, every time I do though I get tons of downvotes and comments like \"wow tanky morde would do no damage wtf noob\" so reading this post from you was awesome.\n\nAnd yeah, tank is misleading. Like you said, it CAN be a main tank but its better suited to an off-tank role. Its surprising how much damage it puts out too, I always wind up either #1 or #2 in damage dealt to champions with it.\n\nAnyways, thanks big time for giving it a try.

Most people don't play Morde, so they don't know about his numbers. Hell, until I read your comment a few days ago *I* had no idea. His ratios aren't the lowest they possibly could be, but .4 on his Q? .66 if the target is isolated? That's pretty terrible scaling. His E, the spell that you'd say is his bread and butter, has a .6 ratio. His W, if you stood next to someone the entire duration, would only total up to a .9 ratio. (And lets face it, you're not standing next to anyone for six seconds as Morde)\n\nThose are horrible numbers for a mage. You can load AP on him all day, and he'd still be doing gimped damage. I just assumed that his ratios were great since he's constantly played as a burst mage. Taking advantage of his high base damages with Mpen seems to be a more efficient route, sort of like {{champion:43}}.\n\nHowever, I did notice that you avoid {{item:3136}}. I know that resistances are better since they lessen the damage his shield takes, but a bit of extra health wouldn't be bad against someone bursty. As well, {{item:3151}} can really bring the pain in this meta of health stacking tanks with {{item:3717}}, even if Morde has no CC to trigger the double proc.","replies":[{"poster":"LifeCyclesTWA","date":"2015-05-11T01:56:53.872+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I read a post that some dude put up on Reddit and did all the math for everyone that would build Liandry's.

So basically at level 18 with only SV as an MR item you have 108 MR, which get reduced to about 50 by AP champions.. this will result in you get insta-blown up if focused by an AP champion. Instead, I use CDR per level runes which provide me with 15% cdr at level 18, 20% total with Masteries (the total CDR I'd receive from WotA and SV combined) and in their place I build Abyssal Scepter and Banshee's. These combined give me a load of MR and mesh well with the other items. FE: Abyssal Scepter reduces the MR of everyone around him, and because they all have reduced MR they take more damage from all of his spells, Thornmail, and Sunfire Cape.\n\nAlso, I strongly believe Rylai's is a weak item on Morde. It doesn't do anything to strengthen his shield (although the 100 AP does help it build up more quickly, I'd argue Abyssal Scepter is better at that as well... especially considering the lack of AP in this build you want your base damage to do as close to 100% damage as possible) Also, due to the fact all of your spells with the exception of your ult is an AoE, you are only slowing people by 15%... this won't stop carries from kiting you. If you like using Rylai's in combination with his ult, keep in mind any decent carry will build QSS to counter it so it is a waste of an item slot.\n\nI find Sunfire Cape and Abyssal Scepter to be core items on Mordekaiser. Its awesome running around being some big nearly impossible to kill thing that does a crap load of damage when you have Abyssal, Sunfire, and Sorc boots. If someone engages on you, your W and Sunfire will eat them up early-mid game. If I'm vs an AD in lane, I rush sunfire. If vs AP, I rush Abyssal. If vs high mobility champion or someone camping my lane, I'll build either a chainmail vest or a negatron cloak (depending on which item I am going for first to win matchup) and rush Sorc Boots.\n\nAlso, new Abyssal Scepter + Void Staff would have a crazy 80% magic penetration at max stacks. Combine that with a flat 15 magic pen from your runes and 15 from your boots, you are doing true damage to squishies and you are hitting tanks hard.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Selegun","date":"2015-05-15T21:52:06.801+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A good build though I would never part with the void staff since that would directly reduce damage and survivability.

At level 18, Sunfire does 43 dps I believe, Abyssal would deal about 43 dps, and your W (before your AP is factored in) does 68 dps. So just by standing around you get 154 dps, which isn't bad. \n\nAlso, with the Abyssal Scepter change to % based reduction as opposed to its current flat magic resist reduction, this hurt Mord a bit imo in some aspects but helps in others. He'll be better at killing tanks, especially if someone else on his team also builds an Abyssal Scepter to get max stacks on enemy team more quickly. However, he'll be a bit worse at killing squishies, especially the ADC because he won't be able to be in their face enough to build up stacks. The worse thing about the new Abyssal Scepter imo is that its a nerf to Thornmail vs ADC's. Previously, everyone within 700 range of you lost 20 mr, and no one aside from special circumstances has an autoattack range above 700, so essentially if anyone tried to autoattack you they'd take extra damage from Thornmail due to Abyssal's mr reduction. I doubt Abyssal will keep the 700 range if they turn it into a pulse, however. But, it is a buff to Thornmail vs melee attackers such as Master Yi.\n\nI'd definitely keep the Sunfire though, as it is the only source of health from items in this build and helps greatly with dueling (aside from the possible 250 we'll get from new scepter) Especially with the new Abyssal Scepter being the way it is, Sunfire + Abyssal + Thornmail will continue to have amazing synergy. I'm not a fan of WotA, however if you are you can always drop the Sunfire late game in exchange for it. I normally drop Sunfire for Randuin's though, as Randuin's is amazing vs AD champs and you still get armor and health from that item slot.\n\nI like the magic pen marks over everything else just because how much it meshes with the build and Morde's kit. Every match no matter what items you put on Mordekaiser over 90-95% of your damage with be magic damage, so due to the overwhelming amount of his total damage output is magic you'll want as much penetration as possible. The best way to improve the damage on your ult is through magic penetration, also, because it is % based damage as opposed to flat damage. I try to use Morde's ult as a last-hitting tool against champions and wait til someone is at their last bit of health then ult them so it is guaranteed to work and can't be QSS'd, so the magic pen helps ensure that that can happen. Especially with the changes to Abyssal Scepter causing it to remove flat penetration in favor of % based penetration, you'll want as much flat magic pen as possible.\n\nAlso, new Abyssal Scepter + Void Staff would have a crazy 80% magic penetration at max stacks. Combine that with a flat 15 magic pen from your runes and 15 from your boots, you are doing true damage to squishies and you are hitting tanks hard.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TheRakkun","date":"2015-05-09T22:04:43.776+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Generally not a good idea to \"Swap out\" an item unless it's boots to a Zephyr,","replies":[]},{"poster":"TasteTheirFear","date":"2015-05-09T19:33:46.231+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You are really not helping your argument here with that tone...","replies":[{"poster":"LifeCyclesTWA","date":"2015-05-09T19:37:16.778+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Tired of seeing my posts get to -5 and whatnot when I even mention \"tank morde\" on these damn forums.
