Basically, in an epic battle of Smurf vs Smurf the enemy Katarina went like 42-2 in the first 30 minutes of the game. Their team took all of our towers and inhibs, and all we could do was defend. I kept telling my team not to surrender because I would be able to kill and ult the Katarina while tanking their team once I hit full build, but the surrender votes kept coming while me and the Shaco (who kept trying to backdoor all game long) were the only ones to vote no, much to the disappointment to our teammates. \n\nAnyways, a game that should have been a 20 minute surrender was won and we all had a game we will never forget lol. The twitch referred to it as \"The Alamo\" and the Katarina was so pissed lmao\n\nhttp://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/1820732498/228378554?tab=overview\n\nEDIT: Just wanted to explain why I bought Zhonya's instead of Luden's Echo or Rabadon's or Lich Bane or whatever. Basically, you can't deal damage if you are dead. Every time Katarina would ult I would pop Zhonya's Hourglass to survive and try to ult either her or the Jinx for the kill.","replies":[{"poster":"Adrian Umbra","date":"2015-05-11T22:43:07.955+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"First: You're not a tank, you're just building fighter Morde rather than mage Morde.

Just wanted to share the post carry high?\n\nDurability Morde does actually do a great amount of damage, so long as you back it up with penetration. Obviously not as much as a dedicated DPSer, but a tank Mord will outdamage any bruiser out there. Magic Penetration + All of his spells being AoEs with high base damage and low CDs = win. 35% mag pen + 15 mag pen from marks and quints + 15 mag pen from boots + 20 mag reduced from abyssal scepter (can reduce mr below 0) = 35% mag pen and 50 mag pen. Void Staff + Abyssal Scepter + Sorc Boots = all the offense you need. Build Sunfire Cape early, if you get full build then sell the sunfire for either a Randuins or a Zhonyas. Thats how I build my Morde.\n\n\nEDIT: Not to mention you get better use of his ghost. Your ghost gets a high % of your bonus health, and also dies when you die. Just by being alive you are doing a load of damage. Plus, CC isn't so frightening when built tank. Your ghost's attacks also build up your passive. If you ult an ADC literally become an unkillable being of death and destruction until they focus down your ghost. If they focus your ghost instead of you/your team, you just won the teamfight.","replies":[{"poster":"Adrian Umbra","date":"2015-05-11T23:36:07.265+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's why I called you a fighter.  _**Tanks wouldn't build penetration.**_  If you built Sivir full durability, would she suddenly be a tank?

What's the point?**_\n\nI believe building any AP on Morde aside from Abyssal Scepter, Void Staff, and POSSIBLY the situational Zhonya's is a massive mistake. His AP ratios are total shit, he benefits enormously from building tank items. Compare his AP ratios to ANY other AP champion in the game. Building Mordekaiser AP is as ridiculous as building Shen AP. Infact, I would go as far as to say AP Shen would be BETTER than the AP Mordekaiser people run, because building a Melee Champion with 0 CC or Mobility damn-near glass cannon is beyond RIDICULOUS. I have 1k+ games as Mordekaiser, the best Mordekaiser has ever been in the League of Legends was when people built him full on tank back in 2010-early 2011 back in the League of Sunfires and when FoN was still in the game. Granted, Mordekaiser has been changed since then, but I strongly believe he regains the strength of old if built magic pen + tanky as hell.The build I ran in this game is the least tanky build I would ever run as Mordekaiser.\n\nAnyways, why post this?

Lets grab baron while their Jinx and Kat are down.\" etc... it was a pretty cool experience helping these guys out. Newer players don't realize KD means absolutely *nothing* In fact, it was stupid for Katarina to take that many kills, she could have made an effort to give kills to her team. She was a terror, she dominated her mid lane, then ganked the shit out of our bottom lane. I just kept the team trying to think positive and we eventually wound up winning. Believe me, nothing is more scary than a fed Katarina to a new player, and being able to conquer that fear at the craziest of levels was awesome.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2015-05-11T23:58:26.146+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Anyone else notice the Katarina never got a Void Staff?
