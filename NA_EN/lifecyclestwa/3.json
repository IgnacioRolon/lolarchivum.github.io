However, while this was a buff to sustained damage users that made use of the BotRK, this also hurt burst damage dealers due to the fact it no longer offers the flat penetration. More frankly, the armor penetration on BC ramps up over time when people that apply burst to targets do not make use of the passive anymore.\r\n\r\nI believe there should be a new build path for Brutalizer because of this. Right now, assassins have 2 options for armor pen: Last Whisper and Ghostblade. I have another contender. Brutalizer + Vamp Sceptor = Essense Reaver. Here is a post I made on a separate thread.\r\n&quot;\r\n\r\nSo you are saying that an item made up of brutalizer + vamp scepter for 3300-3500 for assassins is better than what every other AD champion in the game gets for 3200 gold? Or did you forget that BotRK even exists? Assassins are HEAVILY reliant on burst, whereas other AD champions in the game are HEAVILY reliant on the ability to do a sustained amount of damage. Assassins NEED armor penetration. Right now, only FOUR items in the game provide armor penetration, the only 2 worth using as an assassin are   No, Black Cleaver is SHIT for assassins such as Talon because it provides a shit amount of damage in addition to the fact the armor pen on it ramps up over time and is more suited to people that do sustained damage... SUCH as people that use BotRK.\r\n\r\nThe last item is Warrior enchant, which you need smite to use, so I won&#039;t even include that.\r\n\r\nSo the only 2 items suited to assassins in this whole entire game are Youmuu&#039;s and Last Whisper. That is what I call poor itemization. I do not understand how raising the ER&#039;s cost a couple hundred gold, lowering the damage by 20, and giving it 10% CDR and 10 Armor pen would all of a sudden make it OP, or as you say &quot;a nightmare&quot;\r\n\r\n&quot;","replies":[{"poster":"Tryagainweed","date":"2016-09-12T09:49:22.065+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Brutalizer 2.0 The return of brutalizer the missed item https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlwDKWdgY6k&feature=youtu.be Brutalizer 2.0 FREELo Raise ur division if you enjoyed give a like share subscribe","replies":[]},{"poster":"Venowolf","date":"2015-05-01T08:59:09.814+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Essense Reaver have a lot of sense, with the brutalizer in the build path.","replies":[]}]}
