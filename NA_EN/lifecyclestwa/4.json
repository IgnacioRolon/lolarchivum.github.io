I like building this item on Talon when I am ahead and my jungler doesn&#039;t want to give me blue buff/is blue buff reliant themselves.\r\n\r\nI feel as though AD Casters do not have that powerful item that other AD characters have such as Infinity Edge for ADCs, BotRK for autoattack based fighters, and Black Cleaver for bruisers. This would remedy that.","replies":[{"poster":"The5lacker","date":"2015-04-29T13:58:47.312+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That would also make it completely outstrip Bloodthirster on anybody who uses their keyboard.\n\nThe only reason people don't use Essence Reaver is because they think 10% Lifesteal is more valuable than 10% CDR and a 200g discount (I don't personally think it is, especially on ability-centric Marksmen like Ezreal, Graves, and Lucian.) Especially once you get past about 20% total Lifesteal, it's rarely going to be a deciding factor on your average Marksman due to the fact that Lifesteal does pretty much nothing to defend against their main threat, Assassins.","replies":[{"poster":"grLKQ9ma0o","date":"2015-04-29T20:55:52.153+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The shield is way better.

It needs to be the defining AD caster item in my opinion. Even if they made it the same price as Blood Thirster.\n\nCurrently, Blood Thirster gives TWICE as much life steal and a fatass shield. That is better than what ER provides as it stands unless you are in a special situation. It is sad that BT is a better item than ER for AD casters despite the fact they use the same exact recipe.","replies":[{"poster":"AyRe CoNteMpT","date":"2015-04-29T16:54:51.802+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well yeah because BT makes you stronger in FIGHTS while ER gives you mana sustain which you dont need if you manage your mana carefulyl BEFORE a fight and the mana it gives isnt high enough so you can go into a fight with low mana and still spam everything. this means, they should probably make it leech mana from ALL ad damage and not just from auto attacks. how about that? it could always be at 3% then, which is totally fine.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Annunziato","date":"2015-04-29T09:55:00.929+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They're already fixing this in a sense with the new Black Cleaver.

With {{item:3071}} you'll be able to skip out on the {{item:3275}} and Sorcery Mastery and still hit the 40% cap.","replies":[{"poster":"LifeCyclesTWA","date":"2015-04-29T10:29:56.311+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Personally, I prefer {{item:3508}} and {{item:3035}} to {{item:3071}} and whatever. I like having enough raw AD to burst down an enemy carry, while at the same time not being completely useless against tanks.  I feel like Black Cleaver, especially the new Black Cleaver, is a horrible item for Talon. Its 3k gold for 40 AD and armor penetration that ramps up over time. Last Whisper is better suited to Talon because he runs it, does his burst, then runs like hell, rinse and repeat, he doesn't have to ramp up stacks. I'd rather spend 2.3k on all the penetration I need for bursting squishies and get loads of raw AD than grab some item that gives me a shit amount of AD and no armor pen when I need it most. You can get LW and a vamp sceptor instead for your Ravenous Hydra.\n\nSo basically the build would ideally be; long sword + health pots >>> 3x long swords and if possible boots >>> boots / brutalizer / vamp scepter >>> last whipser >>> hydra >>> youmuu's or essence reaver.  Buy wrath pots in between for roaming power. 10% cdr from youmuu's + 20% from essence reaver + 5% from masteries = near cap.\n\n\nAs he stands, you either roll around with lets say 20% - 25% and are reliant on blue buff, or you roll around with max CDR and HAVE to use the damn Cleaver and are still reliant on blue buff. I love being max mana all the time and never having to go back with Hydra and Reaver","replies":[{"poster":"Annunziato","date":"2015-04-29T15:45:11.287+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even with just Essence Reaver  and CDR boots + Sorcery mastery you're going to end up at 30%. If you get blue you'll cap out and if you really want the extra 10% go Ghostblade. You still have 3 items to play around with.

Don't use the boards much) is almost exactly the build as above.\nSome things to note are I had 5 dragon stacks, baron, blue and red, and the Elixir of Wrath. Without all of that stuff I believe my build landed at 472 AD instead of the shown one. Another fun thing to note is that you can solo baron only if you have 5 stacks on dragon.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"AtheosisX","date":"2015-04-29T09:47:42.053+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agreed.
