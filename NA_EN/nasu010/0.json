League can integrate a point system, similar to the honor system where if players are good they get points from fellow players these same players can down vote these offenders reducing their points, there shoulb be a fair/reasonable amount of points say100 and if a player commits an offence depending on the infractions they have points deducted.\r\n----\r\nIf for example a player afks and the teammates report him each report is a deduction of 2 points 2x number of reports for afk = total amount of points dedicated if afk is the only reported offense other deductions are up to you and if their points fall below a certain thresh hold that player is bared from playing normal PvP and can only play Ai until they return their score above the threshhold, Air matches Award 1 point to their score if it is completed with out any reports.\r\n---\r\nIn the event of toxic players i believe that a new marker/frame/meter should be added to toxic player frames/ratings \r\nI.e if a player is reported as toxic since this is a shaky matter a gauge/ rating system should be used to monitor a players toxic levels, this rating is increased if the player received continuous reports for being toxic and adversely will lover their honor levels, if that player is still toxic and goes above an allowed limit/threshold (30/100, 40 max) they are to be dealt with by Admins/ moderators of riot/approved staff, and placed within a separate bracket of like players until their issue is resolvable.","replies":[{"poster":"Evangele","date":"2019-01-03T06:40:55.311+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:267}} Hey friendo,\n\nWhile this is definitely a concept, I would say that it is much more suited to our [Player Behaviour sub-board](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation)! You might have more interest drawn up there because everyone there is talking about the player behaviour systems! I'm going to lock this one here, because it doesnt quite fit the guidelines for this sub-board but I would really suggest reposting it over there. :)","replies":[]}]}
