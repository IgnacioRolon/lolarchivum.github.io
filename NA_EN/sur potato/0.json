(I mean last season, it was Devourer BotRK)\n\nYou probably would have had to make it so that it only proced on hit from champions, and not from items. That's the main reason why it was broke, because it scaled well with both Champion abilities, and other items.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sur Potato","date":"2016-04-20T15:04:45.787+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"also please let me know how many dislikes are from my horrible puns, and how many are because i'm a salty sailor. very curious :D","replies":[{"poster":"Randomonium","date":"2016-04-20T15:14:30.371+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the dislikes are because both devourer and rageblade are already getting completely changed in the next patch and you obviously didn't read up on it before posting this.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ravenhale","date":"2016-04-20T15:12:14.487+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, on the PBE, Guinsoo is going to cost 3600 and Devourer is being replaced with Blood Razor.
