This would add back her skill expression to the knockup.\r\n\r\nAdd to her E Burrowed: Rek&#039;asi is untargetable while inside a tunnel. This would allow her to dive and make her a bit more slippery.  Also add skill expression to her play.","replies":[{"poster":"Warlord Rhinark","date":"2018-12-08T12:39:22.284+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1.
