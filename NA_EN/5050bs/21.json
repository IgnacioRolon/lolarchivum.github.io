Also crucial to note that prior to this passive, you didn't have a way of activating any plant Q's at lv1. Your jungler practically gets a godly leash as long as you don't hide in a bush, since it prevents popping the seeds out from your passive.\n\nIt is an extremely good passive for the early game on support Zyra, but it's ridiculously inefficient for mid lane Zyra because you simply can't control if they spawn forward. Just that function would already be immensely good of a shift without changing the passive outright.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Zedex","date":"2018-03-09T16:19:52.701+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":7,"body":"I just miss her old passive.

Lower ELO Zyras weren't landing it, higher ELO enemies were dodging it. One of the big concerns was that it was a passive that ONLY worked if you died. Which meant that as you got better at Zyra (read: died less), you got less and less use out of your passive. Sion at least is expected to die in a teamfight, having barrelled his way into the enemy backline. His after-death passive allows him to do his primary job a little longer. Zyra, meanwhile, is a squishy Catcher. She's not supposed to be dying as part of her pattern of attack.","replies":[{"poster":"LankPants","date":"2018-03-09T22:56:57.718+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":">Sion at least is expected to die in a teamfight, having barrelled his way into the enemy backline.\n\nAlso his passive is just generally less worthless. In order to stop Sion hitting you with his passive generally speaking you need to at least burn a slow on him, which means you're at least sacrificing some resources.
