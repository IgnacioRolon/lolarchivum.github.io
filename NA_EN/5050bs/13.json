Maybe.  But he has counter to his counterplay.  And stupidly high agency compared to other champs. \n\nHis passive is made to prevent him from getting bursted.  So you want to have it down to kill him.  So you want to aa and then try to burst him down. However most mages have a range of 525-550.  Yasuo's q and e have a range of 475. All it takes form him is to dash once and he can threaten you.  \n\nHis q having such a  high range means that he can farm even in the most dangerous match ups. I would also love to add that the lifesteal interaction is pure bullshit. His first target counts as single target, only the rest as aoe.  Also because of his range he can in a good degree bully some melee champs.\n\nHis w for some reason spawns from his model as such if he reacts slow he can still block it.  Even if he panics and messes the direction if he timed it correctly he will still block it from every direction. Said ability is extremely weird for a hypercarry to have. That shit is literally an upgraded braum's e. Omegalel. \n\nHis e has such a low cooldown that it is difficult to punish him in lane. Which is again weird because hypercarries have (or should have) weak and abusable early. You also cant see the cd per target which is also bullshit. He has it but his enemies dont. \n\nHis ulti will try to position him out of turret range which is basically the icing on the cake. This shit is literally a bug that riot just plainly avoids talking about. There is in no way in hell it should be an interaction. His ulti blinks to the targets location. Yet under the turrets range he might not blink to his location. Favouritism strikes again.  \n\nAnd lastly, he doesnt have to opt for cdr. Other crit based champs take the short stick and buy extremely low cdr. Others (or rather trynd) have to opt to a weird item to cap cdr. This abomination of a champ doesnt have to opt because his q scales with atk speed, his e is 0.5-0.1 and his ulti scales down to 30 sec. Only his w benefits from cdr.","replies":[{"poster":"5050BS","date":"2019-05-18T11:28:17.351+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"You forget that his Q is an AOE so does not draw minion arggo unlike EVERYONE else.","replies":[]},{"poster":"OneBarrel","date":"2019-05-18T14:27:29.800+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yasuo R blink location depends on your cursor","replies":[{"poster":"Nyarlathοtep","date":"2019-05-18T15:01:46.571+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=OneBarrel,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=eQZjhqI4,comment-id=00000000000000000000000000000001,timestamp=2019-05-18T14:27:29.800+0000)\n>\n> Yasuo R blink location depends on your cursor\n\nACTIVE: Yasuo Flash blinks to the other side of a Sight icon visible Airborne icon airborne enemy champion nearest to the cursor.
