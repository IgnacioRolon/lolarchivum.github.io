Those players doing \"unranked to whatever\" challenges are doing it for a reason. You don't need to be challenger lvl to get out of \"elo hell\" you need to improve and be consistent. You can go 15/0/13 one game if you are going 0/10/4 the next then you should learn how to average those stats out or how to get more of the first game than the second.

Screw whatever the other 9 people are doing. Focus on yourself. How do you make yourself not have the 0/10 or whatever games and more of the 10/0 ones. How do you take advantage of any lead you can take. How do you help around the map. There aren't that many smurfs, it's people who are inconsistent and will play great one game and then play like a monkey the very next one. People who have insanely good games in one and then fall over completely the next regardless of the skill of the opponent. If you compare low rank to mid rank players the main difference is not going to be mechanical skill, it's there but it's not the biggest difference. The biggest difference is actually knowing how to lose gracefully, take advantage of their leads. They will still have terrible games, but you put them in low elo games and they will more than likely just solo carry the vast majority of them. All you need to do to climb is be more consistent than those around you.

A single player game? It's good to know that League of Legends is a game of one real player and a bunch of AI where you can win everytime. Do you want some real numbers? A single person on a team is only 10 percent of the total influence of a League of Legends match. That's right, only 10 percent. On your team, you only control 20 percent of what goes on. That means the other 80 percent is controlled by your teammates. Even if you play a perfect match every single time, there is no guarantee that you're still going to will because you're still only 10 percent of the match.\n\nEven a good player cannot win matches where his or her entire team is feeding. It's simply a fact. You want some other good information? Accounts with a longstanding history get placed in much more difficult matches than newer accounts. Every year I have made it to gold easily with almost a 60 percent win rate on a new account. On this account, I cannot even climb out of Silver. Hell, right now I am having a rough time climbing out of Bronze. I can guarantee however that if I made another account and played ranked on it, that I would easily once again make it back to Gold. The matchmaking is rigged, and I have years of proof regarding it. About a year after I started playing, around Season 3, I started testing the system because I knew something seemed off, and it is. New accounts get way easier matches than accounts that have many games played on them.","replies":[{"poster":"Dynikus","date":"2019-03-23T20:23:13.572+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Rainbow Slayer,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=03MlT9Eo,comment-id=000000000000000000000000000100000001,timestamp=2019-03-23T18:57:06.593+0000)\n>\n>Do you want some real numbers?
