I mean Zyra is a strong addition to any team, but I'd give up a lot of her utility just to have her plants be...you know. Useful.

Any thoughts about that?\n\nPassive: Fertilizer - whenever a champion (ally or enemy) dies near zyra she gains a small amount of a bonus stat (max hp/mana or 4 AP).  \nW: Fruit of Life and Death - an AoE zone that lasts a few seconds, poisoning enemies in it and healing allies in it.","replies":[{"poster":"5050BS","date":"2018-08-09T04:28:27.720+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Im sorry I like her plants.
