It works fine for most ults, but if the particle reaches you when your ult isn't actually counting down its CD - meaning the cast has completely finished and you see a timer for its CD - it has trouble. If your champ's ult uses charges with a tiny CD, like Teemo's, the CD refund is worthless. If it's recastable, like Pyke's, CD refunds during the recast window don't do anything. If it can be reactivated and only goes on CD after you do so, like Swain's, refunds don't count until after that reactivation. Basically, if your ult is not actually and fully on a traditional CD, the refund won't help.\n\nWhen _exactly_ does Rek'Sai's ult go on CD? And is it an ordinary, traditional CD? 7 seconds off sounds like it happened once with a rank 2 ult that had 10% CDR (rounded from 7.2). If she usually gets kills with her ult, I'd theorize that the CD doesn't actually start until after the attack, and, being close to the target when it dies, the particle gets to her too soon, before there's any CD to reduce, and that one time where it worked was for a random kill or assist you got when the ult was firmly on CD.","replies":[{"poster":"5050BS","date":"2019-02-24T23:52:08.224+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So just tested it with the tool and with 20% CDR at lvl 18 it has a 48s CD\n\nI press R and the Ult goes on CD.  She leaps about .5-.75s later and gets the kill at 47s CD on the ult.  The particles get to me and nothing.\n\nI then tested by Ulting and NOT killing the target with the ult and waited 5s later to kill the target and still nothing refunded.\n\nLooks bugged on her Ult\n\nWhat is interesting is that her Ult is like Veigar's Ult.  There is travel time and its about the same for them both but Veigar gets the Refund.","replies":[{"poster":"5050BS","date":"2019-02-26T00:11:34.813+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So I tested it on Garen\n\nHe Presses R and kills the target (its Instant kill no delay) and gets 6s off the Ult with 20% CDR\n\nSo its Just Reksai","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-02-25T01:46:42.575+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That sounds broken.","replies":[]}]}
