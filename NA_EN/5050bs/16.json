We have had the shit end of everything for 2+ years now.\n\nRyze in his latest iteration (by that I mean, after the introduction of his team teleport R and defined combo mechanics in his QWE), his problems have always been his double-scaling making him do too much damage, and his R being too much of a wild card if it's in any viable state.\n\nSo logically speaking, Riot should've tackled those 2 elements to fix him, right? WRONG.\n\nRiot touched just about everything apart from those 2 problematic components, which they're determined to keep them good for some reason.\n\nYou'd think after what, 7 reworks or something, Riot should've learned the lesson now that Ryze's problem centers on his double-scaling and later, his ulti. But I guess not. They'd rather keep on over-committing resource on a single champion dancing around the problem than simply fix the obvious.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"FOR JUSTICE","date":"2019-09-06T03:44:18.708+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"its definitely a bug, because i know Cassiopeia miasma can stop yasuo from ulting, and its functionally the same as a root when it comes to interactions like this.\n\nalbiet it was almost 3 years ago the mechanic never changed:\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/EsHk0MO4-canshould-cassiopeia-grounding-ground-a-yasuos-ult?show=flat&amp;comment=0003","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zlera","date":"2019-09-06T03:36:37.933+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can he?

The move was made more or less in acknowledgement of the \"I was in Alpha\" problem in attempt to reduce Yi players' frustration that they feel like they're often getting hit when they shouldn't (as it used to be that Yi players often get hit during the completely unconveyed cast time that many don't even know the existence of, as well as the bug that hits through untargetability; and if they get CC'ed during cast time his Q would still go off but Yi would finish Q while already in the state of being CC'ed and then die instantly which many player may perceive as a sudden lost control of their character).\n\nIn this case that Yi's Q now goes off instantly, Yi casting Q after being stunned has to either be a bug, or the guy who proclaims it either was seeing things or they lied and it never happened.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"GodlyBane","date":"2019-09-06T23:45:23.103+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Because the game is bugged.
