I get to S1 (3-4 times now) and get a chain of troll/afk/feeders and I drop down some times to S4.

This doesn't mean you are doing better than a university student because you score a full mark, as you and the university students did A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT TEST; it just means you're doing a primary school test and scored full mark in that test.\n\nGet it?","replies":[]}]}
