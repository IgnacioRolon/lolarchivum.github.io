It sounds like you're having a network issue that's causing you to lose sync and get left behind.  I suggest using the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to help get this fixed up.  This wouldn't be a client issue unless you have apps like play.tv running, which can cause crashes.  Hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
