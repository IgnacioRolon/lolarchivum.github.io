A number of normal words are being blocked in my rune and items pages.\n\nI do not have the profanity filter enabled.\n\nI would include a screenshot, but your stupid boards don&#039;t allow that in any obvious way.\n\nSo, one example is I have an item page I named &#039;Malzahar&#039;.  It displays as &#039;Mal*****&#039; every time I try and access the item page.\n\nFix the issues.\n\nAnd I now see that your boards only display a single 'star'.  There should be a 'star' for every letter in Malzahar's name.  God, you guys make even this simple process of reporting a bug difficult.","replies":[{"poster":"UnboundHades","date":"2018-01-06T02:32:38.037+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if you want to post an image such as a screen shot refer to this\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/memes/esjzN2Q1-posting-images-and-gifs-on-the-boards","replies":[]},{"poster":"Boomtick","date":"2018-01-06T02:32:24.468+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://imgur.com/a/sNdLx","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-01-06T02:29:34.387+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Reminds me of the Pokemon GTS blocking all Co%%%rigus trades back in Gen5.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Who Fed Ru","date":"2018-01-06T02:28:25.741+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it's because the champ is so hard cancer that it his name has to be censored","replies":[]},{"poster":"Violet Fields","date":"2018-01-06T02:28:10.992+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"press PRT SCR, paste it into paint, upload it to imgur, and grab the image url","replies":[]}]}
