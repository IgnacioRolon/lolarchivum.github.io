I  returned to LoL after 2 years break. My max was D2 on EuW by playing skarner top. I decided to left league, because riot was completly neutral about skarner ( but that's not important ) and mainly  **because of the smurfs.....**\n\nCurrently i am in DIamond 2 and winning most of my games. I have 70% winratio in the last week.\n But unfortunately  i have enough league of legends at the moment. Why?\n\n Every f..... day i enounter on opponent  which is a smurf with 80% + winratio...Now i lost my promo to Diamond 1, because  my first opponent was twitch with 80% winratio, and next game duo smurfs vayne + lulu with 85% winratio.\n\nYesterday my oponents were katarina with 98% winratio ( 56 games and 1 lose) duoQ with Jarvan4.\n\n\nIt's SUPER unfair, because i  havej ust got 2 free loses in a row in my promo...Ok, i am super unlucky, because i got 5x in a row smurfs in the enemy team ( i can show you screen if you don't believe) but in my opinion smufing should be bannable.... This is literally roulette, not the game....\n\nI lost 100+ LP because i had 5x in enemy team smufs from challenger...\n\n\n\n\nI mean smufs from platinum/diamond in gold/silver are not big problem, because they often do not understand the game, but smurfing  twitch /evelyn/ katarina  as a challenger in high diamond is a literally bullshit....\n\n\nSmurfing is the biggest problem in high elo, because there are only a few players and i  enounter a smurf every single day!!!!\n\n\nOk, that's not in  every match, but now i lost promo because of smurfs, and previously same situation......-_-\n( btw i am not crying, just telling you HUGE problem that i decided to stop playing LoL 2 years ago and i will probably make the same decision again...I am tryharding to gain LP, and next im losing literally for free, my impact is literally 0, because i play toplane and smurfs usually play jungle/mid/adc and during mid game they re super fed)","replies":[{"poster":"Sukishoo","date":"2019-10-07T02:12:15.295+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"What do you expect them to do though?

Again as I said, what do you want them to do? You aren't offering ANYTHING by just complaining that there are too many smurfs and \"something needs to be done\" cause that could be anything or nothing at all.","replies":[{"poster":"ZadloBoze2010PL","date":"2019-10-07T19:47:27.738+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"You' re right, like i said climing is still possible.
