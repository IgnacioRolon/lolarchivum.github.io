So far I have 2 remakes that put me through 10min ban for 5 games. I sit through each game and as soon as I play after the bans my game froze mid game leaving me 20 min bans for five games. Today my game didn't go through the loading screen again, which means another remake. Please fix this I'm being punished for something unintentional. I don't know what board to put this to but hopefully this one helps.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-05T18:27:15.525+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can you be more specific about how the freezes or loading-screen issues happen? Do you get a specific error message, when the game freezes is it just that nothing is moving but you can freely exit the client, or do you have the entire PC freeze? With a bit more info, I can provide the right steps to take.","replies":[{"poster":"jJohnnyBoi","date":"2016-10-12T12:09:11.955+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Game freezes but I can still exit out the client","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-12T21:33:20.564+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you're experiencing heavy packet loss to the server and at some point, your client stops receiving/sending packets entirely.
