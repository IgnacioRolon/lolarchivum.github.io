The peculiar part about this is that the games let me pass through after 3 minutes of the game when surrender vote passes and it'll give me a leaver. Note that this always happens on the first games after that it's back to normal... Also note that I have repaired the files countless times, changed the DNS server, re-download the client a few times, and checked my internet if it is the source of problem. I can't find a diagnosis and I want your support to fix this issue.  I'm being punished severely unintentionally and please fix this. I am not a technician or a programmer so I need your help for this\n\n\nSincerely and Frankly, Rocketeer2606","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-15T02:15:45.892+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Every time I've seen this, it's been caused by missing assets in League preventing you from loading in a match until it's had a chance to grab the files and cache them in memory. I'd recommend working through our [permissions guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) to ensure League can properly save and load files. \n\nLet me know if those steps caused any change.","replies":[]}]}
