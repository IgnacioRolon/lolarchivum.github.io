We are then punished for this issue with the client.  Leaver buster penalty is unreasonable because of this bug.  Also it would be nice to dodge a game if you have a troll on the team without a penalty.","replies":[{"poster":"Freestylekilla","date":"2016-09-07T18:50:59.325+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well whether you are aware of it or not I am not quite sure. I have experienced it as well as many of my friends.  It is a game bug so the connection guide is going to be useless. Let me know when you look into the issue. I know major streamers such as Imaqtpie as well as others also have been having these same bugs. Not connection issues.  Thank you","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-07T18:01:53.470+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not aware of any known bugs with freezing in champ select. I am aware there are a number of local network settings that can cause freezes in champ select, though. If you're personally seeing these issues, I strongly recommend working through the steps in our [connection guide.](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) There have also been some third-party apps such as Plays.tv that have been causing freezes, along with the new Game DVR feature in the Xbox game bar causing problems as well, but I think the connection guide is a great place to start.\n\nAs for Dodge queues, we understand emergencies and IRL stuff happens, which is why you don't see a queue timer for occasional dodges. A trend of dodging will result in a queue timer, though. Trolls exist everywhere on the internet, so it's inevitable that you'll run into one occasionally in League. The best move you can take is to report them after the match to ensure that if they continue being trolls and ruining the game for others, they'll see justice on the rift.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]}]}
