I'd usually have 60-70 ping which is fine with me. but recently, my client has been very laggy and slow and every time Im queueing in ranked games my client just completely freezes during champ select and i just lose lp. once or twice ive been able to finally get in a game but when i do, my game is just unplayable. Im not lagging but my whole game is slow. Idk how to explain it but the game is super sluggish and everything i do is delayed and glitchy and the sounds are distorted like a crackling sound. also when im trying to levelup an ability, i click the  ablility and hear the level up noise but the indicator just freezes and it shows the point into the ability but the level up icon just stays there. i really cant play and have no idea what the problem is. How do i fix this??? thanks","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-18T21:32:14.320+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It almost sounds like you're experiencing some packet loss as opposed to the usual type of lag.
