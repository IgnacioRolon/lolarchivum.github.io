He doesn't think that, your team does. \nAlso, I think he was posting just to test your reaction. And then you proved his point.

Because when my team fights, I usually just not join so I don't get reported by some rager. So, since you are usually the one in the conversation, I will ask you: does it bother you? \n\nFinally (I'll stop bothering you), do you consider yourself a troll? I know that a lot of people make smurfs to troll. Is that what you're doing? Or are you sincerely trying to raise some poor soul in elo hell?","replies":[{"poster":"lolptwo","date":"2015-11-09T05:28:16.171+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey there, I agree there are a lot of trolls in this game. That is part of the huge problem with League right now. Secondly that's exactly the massive problem with Silver Q right now. If you were thinking logically you would understand not even challenger players dodge every single skill shot, unless you're scripting it's almost nearly impossible to dodge every single skill shot in the game, that would be insane so I don't know why you have such suspicions that are rooted in illogical reasoning. I see you used the word \"any\" to my words if you read the script properly \"i hit him with a Q one time\" which is two very very different things\n\n\nSecondly that's kind of the point of this point, why do Silver players think smurfs are automatically assholes when they are showing no signs of being what you are accusing them of. That is the issue with low elo players. If I had Dyrus/any high elo player comes in my game and go \"Ok guys i'm giving you all a free lesson on League of Legends\" I wouldn't immediately assume he was an asshole who was condescending me. That is inferiority complex. Thirdly I wouldn't become toxic to him for giving me advice even if I thought it was wrong, I might not do it but it wouldn't send me in a complete flux. \n\n\nSure no worries, it would be hard to offend me through League boards....I post on many places because I find Riot's complacency with issues that have been present for many years, sort of appalling. They vigorously defend that 99.99% of players are not toxic and do not get banned, however I can promise you despite Negativity Bias, this number is most definitely higher than what they are claiming. This is not my normal acc that I play on I use this account solely for boards use, so I don't get people trolling me in ranked when they notice my name etc.\n\n\nLastly, the last person on my team's silence does not bother me in one bit. He's choosing not to take part in the disgusting acts of his teammates, I can only assume he's fed up and does not condone their actions and wants to get through the game as calmly as possible without any confrontation.\n\nLastly I'm not a troll, farthest thing from actually. I'm a competitive person, and I love to win. I hate to lose, I play in this elo, because my even though my main is very high ranked and has all champions and runes I could possibly want. I wouldn't be there long if I was constantly trying out new champs in ranked, and with my competitive spirit I don't find much enjoyment in norms, and it's mostly a crap shoot of random builds. So I take to ranked in a low elo to learn mechanics and play of new champions until I can climb -said account- to a high enough level I would test out a ranked game on my main account. I still usually maintain an extremely high  win rate on these smurfs but I genuinely would love to help polite, mature silver players get to their respective level through advice","replies":[{"poster":"RiverWind0407","date":"2015-11-09T05:46:11.685+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol, ok i must have reading problems.

I really don't know. I mean, I know that once, there was this horribly toxic adc that was completely abusing the sup even though the sup was only level 3 or something. I was really fed up and I, though ashamed about it now, cursed at him and told him to stfu. Not proud of it, but at the time, I felt that I did the right thing by protecting a new player. \n\nAnd thank you for understanding the last player's silence.
