The Malzahar skin went through but the Ziggs one didnt. After figuring out the issue he sent it to the other Rexnut on his account. The reason for there being 2 Rexnuts is because the original who is my cousin regrettably committed suicide a little over a year ago and i wasnt able to take his summoner name so i made due with a greek letter to keep his league name alive. That being said he has sent in a ticket but was wondering if there was any way a forum post could get faster attention to get the Ziggs skin on the correct account or to refund his RP.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-11T01:41:58.510+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeouch, that must feel pretty bad =\\ . Since this was an error due to a weird misspelling, we should be able to get this figured out for you. Reach out to our billing team in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and let them know this was simply due to confusing between names.","replies":[]}]}
