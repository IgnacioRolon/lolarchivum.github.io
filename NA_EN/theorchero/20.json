Good example is GP.\n\nHe&#039;s AD and scales with items just as hard or harder than ADCs. He has a weaker early game than just about 90% of the roster. He has poke, but he&#039;s melee, so he can either poke with Q or farm with Q. He has the TOOLS to play safe, but unless the enemy is making a lot of mistakes he&#039;s not going to straight up bully most matchups that aren&#039;t Nasus.\n\nAfter his first expensive item (Triforce), he&#039;s a threat but he still has to play properly to be close to able to 1v1 anyone. ADCs? They have an entire *class* dedicated to protecting their ass while they shred your entire team because that ONE item they have is 1.5x a power spike as most other champions because of natural steroids.\n\nLook, my point is that NO adc should be able to go top lane without losing the 1v1 early game. NO adc should be able to go mid lane without losing the early game because they ALL scale so hard. MAYBE you had an argument for champions like Cait, but since her buffs and minor rework she&#039;s just as good late game as she is early, and Varus has buffs on the pbe too.\n\nIf ADCs are going to continue to be good early game, nerf their late game so they can&#039;t just drain tank any bruiser&#039;s damage and melt towers with no effort. We&#039;ve had six seasons where the game has LITERALLY revolved around ADCs and bot lane. It&#039;s time that changed.\n\n\n**EDIT BECAUSE PEOPLE AREN'T READING MY RESPONSES TO THE SAME Q'S**\n\n\"ADC'S DO HAVE A WEAK EARLY GAME\"\n\nOkay, so ADC's are weak by comparison because they aren't able to kill mages or other squishies in 1-2 autos and tanks in 7. But I specifically mentioned **in solo lanes.** And NO, I haven't had my ass handed to me by an adc in a solo lane. I haven't played against it in months.\n\nThe reason I don't think ADCs should be able to 1v1 if they outscale massively is because they don't follow the paradigm you need them to in order for them to be balanced in this situation.\n\nPower early game <--------   Mid Game Power  ---------> Power Late Game\n\nChampions with early power, like Renekton and Pantheon, **fall off hard.** They are almost unstoppable 1v1 with few exceptions (such as Jax into Renekton, but that just makes it a skill matchup instead) and are useless late game and mid game if they don't snowball.\n\nMid game champions either tilt towards late or early game based off item spikes. Champions like Irelia are in this category IMO because she spikes really hard with Triforce but unless she's able to dive carries late game she's useless.\n\nLate game champions, or classes in my particular case, should be weak early game. It's okay to have safety tools to help with this (Nasus lifesteal, ranged forms of farming based on abilities) but ADCs have safety tools and steroids out the ass as an entire class. \n\nRyze was specifically reworked twice because he bullied top laners hard while outscaling them, often times to the point that he was strong at ALL points in the game (Fun fact but unrelated, Ryze is broke af now.) Most ADCs (most notably Vayne, Caitlyn, etc) can go into one or more solo lanes and bully the laner while being able to outscale them as well.\n\n**GRANTED** in a lot of matchups, the mid game becomes a different story, and ADCs without good disengage tools will find themselves engaged on and beaten to death by bruisers who are mobile. But Immobile ones like Darius, Illaoi, etc have little to no possible recourse.\n\n\"Then why pair them with a support?\"\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Theorchero,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Ak8Exlb9,comment-id=000d0002,timestamp=2016-11-30T16:25:28.534+0000)\n>\n> It&#x27;s because there&#x27;s an extra player available, and the ADC is the most important role AND they scale extremely hard with gold.\n> \n> So naturally, you pair the off player up with them on a champion that can do a lot with very little gold income to help *ensure* that they get farm. It&#x27;s not that ADCs *can&#x27;t* solo lane and win vs solo lane champions, because of their range and strong auto attack they are often extremely oppressive, so they basically require jungle attention. So if bot adc&#x27;s didn&#x27;t have a support they&#x27;d be getting ganks all day and it&#x27;d be 2v2 constantly because both junglers would never leave except to farm.\n> \n> The entire game, the meta, the very MAP has been warped around the ADC role. How many times has individual jungle camps been nerfed because bot lane could take gromp and give their adc level 2 while the other adc was lvl 1? That had to be nerfed for all non jungle champions because the ADCs would snowball and take over the game because they&#x27;re ADCs.\n\n\n\"What do you propose then?\"\n\n\nOkay, so if we don't want to completely gut early game for ADCs (which would, ironically, enforce the meta more by ensuring support never leaves bot), then we need to change the game's dependency on ADCs in order to take turrets or neutral objectives.\n\nI think giving mages additional ways to damage the turrets via auto attacks is a good start. They do 40% of their AP already which is a good thing but it's still nowhere as safe as ADCs, but this could break hybrid champions. Instead, I'd rather see Baron have reduced magic resistance so you're less reliant on having an ADC in order to do baron in a timely manner.\n\nThis gives less requirements to having an adc at all. If you really want to reform the meta, let's give double relic shield a buff so that if you have two champions that proc relic shields you receive increased healing. This lets you have a melee support and a carry bot laner that's melee to be viable. Tired of yasuo? Make them live in bot lane instead of mid :D.\n","replies":[{"poster":"Snowplosion","date":"2016-11-30T16:02:55.413+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":27,"body":"I know how people like to say ADCs have a strong and safe early game, but then why the fuck do we lane with a support.

My main gripe is that a lot of these champions can go into teamfights with just 1 or 2 items they wreck face while still scaling so hard.

The whole idea of marksmen being weak early game is a myth on multiple levels at this point: not only have marksmen always been covered by supports when they did have a weak early game, effectively mitigating a large part of that weakness, but now marksmen also get to go into solo roles, with many of them performing consistently well, to the point of bullying other laners, including classic lane bullies like Renekton or Garen. Nerfing the early game of marksmen would be seriously mitigated by them just being able to turtle in bot lane and avoid a lot of that impact, and the overall result may not be fun for everyone, since it might just encourage passive play and hard-farming. It also doesn't address the fact that marksmen are often ridiculously dominant at full builds, with enough damage to surpass even some assassins when bursting down squishies, on top of premier tank-busting and objective-capping power.\n\nI also take issue with the idea of any given class being a designated early-game/mid-game/late-game class: we have late-game fighters and assassins, early-game mages, and even a whole bunch of marksmen notorious for their strong early to mid games, e.g. Corki, Ezreal, Graves, Miss Fortune, etc. While it might make sense for some classes to be naturally stronger at different stages of the game, I don't think that should be enforced at all through deliberate power curve adjustments. Currently, that is the case with marksman itemization, which stands head and shoulders above all other items in both cost and raw power, especially now that mage and tank items have mostly had their cost and stats reduced across the board over time.\n\nBecause of this, I agree much more with OP's last paragraph. Letting marksmen have some strength early on is fine, and can make for more exciting gameplay overall (more powerful marksmen means they can be more aggressive), as well as allow more diversity through early- versus mid-/late-game marksman picks; giving all marksmen a guaranteed top-tier late game, however, isn't, and I feel has had a pretty significant negative impact on balance, game health and diversity throughout all competitive seasons. Because marksmen are considered late-game gods by default, they're mandatory in every game, with several supports even designed explicitly to cater to marksmen (e.g. Janna with her AD shield, or Lulu with her attack speed bonus), which pushes pretty much every non-marksman hypercarry out of the spotlight. The late-game power of marksmen is often so extreme that we're now at a stage where the DPS of an average marksmen has become comparable to the burst window of several assassins, which has also contributed to a larger environment where everyone dies too quickly and deals a bit too much damage. Removing that guaranteed late game for marksmen would likely make the game more interesting for all, and could be the first step towards a much more diverse League of Legends, with truly viable team comps that do not revolve around, or even feature, marksmen.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Atreus Jones","date":"2016-11-30T14:49:22.142+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":14,"body":"From experience,\n\nPick a jungler with an engage like Lee's Q or Ivern's snare, maybe even Sejuani ult, and camp bot, they'll fall behind","replies":[{"poster":"Theorchero","date":"2016-11-30T14:51:11.439+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":10,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Alpha Braum Main,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Ak8Exlb9,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-11-30T14:49:22.142+0000)\n>\n> From experience,\n> \n> Pick a jungler with an engage like Lee&#x27;s Q or Ivern&#x27;s snare, maybe even Sejuani ult, and camp bot, they&#x27;ll fall behind\n\nCompared to your adc, sure.\n\nBut even while behind if they have one or two items they will still shred turrets and baron/drag faster than anyone else.

His passive DOES help, but TBH Veigar's sheer AP boost to his AA tower damage will overtake it easily.\n\n>Then there&#x27;s also champs like Azir and Teemo who can do both through ADC like means.\n\nOnly through attack speed. Teemo's on hit damage won't affect the turret.

I mean, it'll SAY that a crit procced for the sake of abilities that trigger from crits, but no extra damage is dealt. If anything, if you crap all over crit stats, ADCs will build armor pen and raw damage instead, which will make them EVEN MORE effective vs turrets.
