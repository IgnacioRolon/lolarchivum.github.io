Out of combat, it's **105** movement speed.\r\n\r\nAs the support you should be roaming the map frequently, and you should be fighting frequently as well. If you are in combat your movement speed slows to a crawl. Being able to maneuver in teamfights is important as a support as it allows you to kite or reach carries that need to be peeled that much easier.\r\n\r\nREMEMBER, get Move Fast Boots, because when you need to move, YOU NEED TO MOVE FAST.â„¢","replies":[]}
