We can analyze the situation and adapt just fine.  I do it all the time when I know I have to fight a Vayne because I know how to counter build her.  Doesn't mean I can't find her annoying.\n\n2, the hitbox in the video does seem rather nuts.  Riot has a history of odd hitboxes, but sometimes they really get out of hand.\n\nAnd 3, relating to point 1, I have adapted to {{champion:79}}'s knock back when I play champions like Poppy.  Namely in that I make sure it's on cooldown before I try to stun him.  That does not mean I can't be annoyed or complain about the ability.\n\nPoints 1 and 3 are basically the same because people are allowed to complain and debate on a forum.  That's what forums are basically for.

I guess most of them are displacements, but for example Camille E and Gragas E will both stop Quinn E, even though Quinn E is usually cast second.\nNot sure about Poppy, but I think Quinn stops her E because Quinn gets a small displacement on her E.\nAlistar's is because his is delayed (I think). He goes into them and then hits them back, while Gragas hits them from further away, because of the shitbox, when he knocks you up, he hasn't actually hit you with his model yet thus your CC hasn't actually hit him yet.","replies":[{"poster":"My Waifu Vanilla","date":"2017-07-11T15:32:35.277+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's the fact that I am pretty sure the only thing that takes priority over Grag E IS Grag E.

Body Slam on gragas is a short range, linear skill shot ability that has a travel distance speed. Anyone that can get themselves out of range or around the dashed ability has utilized the abilities standard and intended counter play. Gragas overcomes this intended counter play by being able to freely use flash to change the angle, range, and speed of the skillshot at will. This may come at the cost of the summoner spell, but it removes the skills intended counter plays in return for often being able to net a kill. also, as i'll say again, bearing this hit box.\n\nIt's an intended flaw, being removed to exploit an enemies intended flaw, while being really generous about it. which makes it very overbearing.","replies":[{"poster":"leona4lyfe","date":"2017-07-11T22:17:26.441+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"aw","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
