ENTIRELY different. Dodging in extremely slanted matchups is actually a smart thing to do because you may lose 3 LP, but you keep your mmr so your gains will stay high.\n\nAs for your advice in how to deal with that, I was mid. Lux mid into vi means that I will get camped all day, and if I'm not fucked enough morg roams could screw me even harder. On top of that, shields from both lux/morg would prevent ghost creation.\n\nAlso, while Morde can push fast and take down turrets fairly quickly, he's still a way better teamfighter than he is a split pusher, because he has 0 chance of escaping ganks. Especially from snares. It's also unlikely that I would survive and I'd be lucky to trade even because with the snares they could just burst me from outside of the range of my abilities.","replies":[{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2016-07-24T08:19:56.581+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry, I meant to say dodged.

You could probably have beaten the Yasuo, and Cho'gath can easily shrug off Lux's harass.\nAs for splitpushing, you don't have to run away.  Just fight and kill whoever comes to stop you.  If they send only 1 person to do that, you should win and keep pushing.  If they send more than 1, tell your team to take the free objectives while they have the numbers advantage.\n\nI'd also like to point out that you can dodge Mogana and Luz's snares.

In addition to that it also makes doing our jobs late game that much harder. Morg Q has a horrible hitbox and both Cho and Morde have larger than average hitboxes, it would be very difficult to dodge snares closely enough to matter. We'd have to over compensate to ensure we dodged it, and that would effectively trap us for at least one second because of the motion of backstepping in order to dodge it is effectively CC in and of itself. That's one of the reasons some really good morg players can catch enemies in lane (when being ganked) without even having to land her Q; the enemy laner is so focused on dodging it that they aren't escaping.\n\nAnd yeah I might do well vs a Yasuo, but he's still super mobile and liable to get fed off of positional mistakes and picks. If he got ahead he'd be nearly impossible to kill (as Yasuo can build fairly tanky and still do shitloads of damage) on top of all the shields would make it nearly impossible to turn his power for my team via my ult.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Captain Aishi","date":"2016-07-24T22:04:18.471+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree, I play league of legends to have fun, and if vayne and yasuo are in the game, fun won't be possible, this is high level decision making right here! +1","replies":[]},{"poster":"Best Valor NA","date":"2016-07-24T07:14:44.465+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"belongs in memes +games or misc. but i like it +1","replies":[]}]}
