{"poster":"Theorchero","date":"2016-07-25T20:00:49.236+0000","title":"An Analysis of what damage creep is, and what has caused it (WARNING: WALL OF TEXT)","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":160,"down_votes":9,"body":"FEAR NOT, THERE IS A TLDR AT THE BOTTOM\n\nI opted to create a new thread because I believe this particular point warrants discussion, as I wanted to go over the origins of damage creep (which is starting to take roll in GP&amp;B and other league related forums, so to prevent uneducated bandwagoning I wanted to create a conversation that isn&#039;t limited to one or two pages in an unrelated thread.)\n\nMost of our core problems in today&#039;s league is because of **damage creep**.\n\nBefore I continue, I want to establish some basic definitions. I know these are pretty obvious for veterans but through the context of my thread I want to make sure it&#039;s very clear what class of champions I am talking about.\n\n**Damage creep** (or any other type of, &#039;x&#039; creep) is where over the course of a game&#039;s lifetime, certain older aspects become outdated because game designers are pressured to create more unique experiences. This results in every new champions/cards/characters/abilities/items etc (throughout many different game genres, particularly notable in trading card games) being relatively more powerful than the last to some extent.\n\n**Tanks** very durable champions that deal moderate to low damage but have high utility and generally CC. They often have defensive steroids and may or may not have mobility. This class of champion is often confused with Bruiser/Fighters because they are often tanky, but typically build 1-2 damage items then go straight tank. The primary difference is that Tanks provide **disruption** and that is their main purpose, not diving enemy carries. Examples: Sejuani, Malphite, Maokai, etc.\n\n**Fighters** relatively durable champions that tend to reside Top lane. Their job is provide DPS and to dive enemy carries, in order to do so they have to have enough base damage and tankiness in order to successfully dive teams. Their primary weakness is mobility, but not all fighters share this weakness; Typically, mobility is inversely proportional to durability. The more mobile, the less durable. Fighters specialize in sustained damage. Fighters that are behind (and then typically lack either the defenses or damage to kill enemy carries) are normally relegated to peeling instead of diving, as they have enough damage or CC to help prevent other fighters or tanks from disrupting their backline.\n\n**Juggernauts** are a subset of Fighters. The reason they have an entirely different section is simple, the juggernaut update. Riot wanted to make Fighters and Juggernauts more distinct, so they added various Juggernaut items (most notably Dead Man&#039;s plate and revamped Black Cleaver) and slightly to moderately reworked a number of champions. Their goal was that Juggernauts&#039; main weakness was their ability to close onto an enemy team; but once they got there (paid the price however so, flash, team ulti, etc) they thrived in the middle of combat, outputting large amounts of damage and taking significant punishment. The way they implemented this (juggernaut items) contributes to the overall problem of damage creep.\n\nHere&#039;s a good video by Extra Credits about power creep in general, useful to watch as it helps bring this thread into perspective.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxszx60ZwGw\n\n**Onto the good stuff**\n\nIn all of League&#039;s history, there have been many, many, many balance changes. Whole seasons worth. This helps keep the game fresh. The only problem with this, is that Riot has always preferred to buff weaker champions instead of gutting strong ones. Nerfs are issued all the time, but Riot normally tries to tackle an issue first by solving the underlying *problems* as to why that champion is so dominant. Typically these are additions of new items (or changes to items) or nerfs of a particular class or champion that kept that subset at bay. In early Season 5, Akali was extremely powerful because ADCs were extremely strong, and many of them had just been reworked (or still incredibly dominant as the case of Kalista) and were exceptionally mobile, so traditional assassins (who had fallen out of favor due to a very strong tank meta) were having difficulty killing the extremely powerful ADCs, so Akali rose to dominance. Her damage and reliability against highly mobile champions were unmatched, she was pick/ban until her range and reliability (the very reason she was picked) was nerfed.\n\nThat&#039;s just one example of the reason that certain champs rise and fall, but ultimately the primary balance lever that Riot utilizes  is damage increases. Over the course of six seasons, champions deal way more damage than they used to, relatively to the ability for tanks to shrug off damage. In season 1 or two, a full tank shen could run most of the way from spawn to spawn while being pummeled by 5 people before finally dying. Now, he&#039;s lucky to last 5 seconds. If he&#039;s behind, he will be melted just as quick as a fed adc melts raptors, and with equal mercy.\n\nWhy is this a problem? Well, it&#039;s because damage has increased across the board. Once you&#039;re behind, you will never, bar few exceptions, match the enemies damage, the only way to come back is to catch someone out and force even fights because of that critical mistake. The reason that&#039;s the case is because *base damage has increased* and when I mean, base damage, I don&#039;t necessarily just mean the literal base damage of abilities. Just the damage that you&#039;d expect any ability with part of or an entire core (not particularly fed, just on-track with reaching powerspikes at X time.) This being the case, damage items beyond the first (due to Juggernaut update, items with health and or other forms of durability, having also damage components) are incredibly strong, **because you deal more damage than the enemy while also being simultaneously tankier than them, making it very hard for them to kill you.** This just becomes even worse because when you&#039;re behind, you&#039;re not on-track to hit your power spike, so you take longer to reach a point that&#039;s already inferior.\n\nSo to truly understand damage creep, you have to understand tank creep. When S1 and S2 was around, again, tanks were fucking impossible to kill. The reason that Vayne was SO dominant is that because late game, she had the mobility and the raw damage to guarantee that she could punch through the enemies tanks. And as anyone that&#039;s high elo or has decent game knowledge should know, the team that wins a teamfight is the team whose tanks last longer (barring certain exceptions like carries being caught out and immediately killed) because they can peel for the backline to prevent their deaths so they can deal damage. So Vayne was strong late, but exceptionally weak early. This is a perfectly fine design decision and provides meaningful gameplay choices because if you opt to play late game, you should suffer verses early game bullies like Caitlyn. Well, then everything gets switched on its head. Vayne&#039;s late game gets nerfed because the base damage on her W let her kill squishies (which was there to help mitigate her crap early game) to help emphasize her late, except her late wasn&#039;t there anymore because she simply wasn&#039;t as effective as she used to be, and with moderate nerfs to tanks (introduction of the first iteration of black cleaver, improved last whisper, etc) she didn&#039;t warrant the weak laning phase.\n\nThis rose a problem with tanks still being hard to kill because certain release valves, like Vayne with % HP damage, to counter tanks building massive durability and being unkillable (while being fun for the tank, is really retarded for the enemy team to deal with) were gone. So they started to add those valves artificially back into the game. They added Botrk, Liandrys, etc. Various forms of % HP damage on champion abilities and on items, all to try and curb out the major problem; people were tanking too much and stalling games too hard. In my opinion, this is okay game design because all % HP damage does is help guarantee that you have certain contribution, granted it&#039;s not taken too far.\n\nAll of these things came together to obliterate tanks. They could no longer tank entire enemy teams due to the HP and resistances shred. And that&#039;s ok, except it left fighters in a really awkward state because they didn&#039;t have the damage to kill the carries in their now more-restricted time frame. Instead of 20-30 seconds, you have 5 seconds. Max. Fighters with few exceptions start falling out of favor, and in comes the league of assassins, in order to counter the insane damage of ADCs (who were that powerful in the first place in an attempt to kill tanks, (starting to make sense now?) but now instead of shredding tanks they were also OBLITERATING squishies which prompted the assassin meta.)\n\nThis is where the god-tier junglers of Kha, Lee, and J4 come into play. They were AD, so they had excellent clears, early pressure, and most importantly could snowball both top and bottom lane. Top so that if your top is ahead they could kill the enemy ADC, and bot so that if your ADC is ahead he can delete the entire enemy team. Yada Yada, and eventually Tanks had to rise again in order to peel for Carries (which they couldn&#039;t, because they felt like shit to play because they were completely outclassed in damage and ability to clear the jg) so enter Cinderhulk. Just about everyone knows what shit that started. Sej was buffed to include %HP damage and ran rampant, tanks started to delete squishies, etc. And the cycle continued, eventually culminating in the jugger update where damage items included HP.\n\n**OK, ENOUGH HISTORY PLEASE GET TO THE POINT / TLDR PLS**\n\nAlright alright. The problem with league at the moment is that damage items are inseparable from tank stats. Most bruiser/damage items include health of some kind. ADCs get lifesteal and a shield from BT, Tanks and bruisers and certain bullshit cigar-missing ADCs get health and damage from jugger items, etc. Basically, all of the high-ticket items that deal a lot of damage increase health to some degree to help counter that tanks deal fuckloads of damage now due to those jugger items in and of itself. This leads to the problem that when you&#039;re ahead, **you&#039;re simultaneously building defense and offense, which is fucking bullshit.** Damage creep has occurred mostly due to Riot&#039;s policy of buffing instead of nerfing and wanting for explosive games that are good for LCS viewership.\n\n**SOLUTION**\n\nReduce damage across the board by about 20%. Rework items so that their focus is on defense or offense. If they are for both, then both need to be significantly weaker than items of that budget that focuses on one. (This is why rylais is broken.) ADCs should have to take time to kill tanks. Tanks should not be dealing much damage at all except to jungle or minions. They need to have DISRUPTION, not damage, be their primary way of engaging or peeling. Fighters need sustained damage, not burst. Reduce penetration of bonus defenses. Tanks stacking defenses should fucking mean something, and ADCs should not be able to have 2-3 tank items and still be capable of deleting people.\n\nThanks for reading. let me know what you think below.\n\nEDIT: Okay, so numerically speaking (as in number of instances) Riot has tended to nerf more than buff. But what I *meant* to say (but will not edit for the sake of clarity) was that the *impact* of previous damage increases/buffs was much greater than that of nerfs. This leads to a slow but steady upward trend.","replies":[{"poster":"Mistress Shyvana","date":"2016-07-25T21:15:08.110+0000","up_votes":48,"down_votes":8,"body":"Such a beautiful FUCKING post.

My favorite ADC is {{champion:18}}  and she is completely squishy.  I try to build items that give some health and damage - just like you said.  And when it reaches late game if I can stay behind the lines I can take down a tank in 3 seconds or an assassin in 1.3.  Sucks being squishy, but by this point I am relatively easily poking and taking damage without getting hurt too much.  Far more gutsy than early game and I still don't build defensive.  I don't think it should be nerfed totally for the weapons, but rather that the weapons should scale.\n\nI think that to make items balanced they need to scale more than be flat numbers.  Yea, flat numbers are easy: but balance is complicated.  We can't have an easy solution to a complicated problem and expect it to work consistently.  Make offensive items add a % to health, make it more amusing on mage items just to avoid messing things up and make the % bonus come from AP, say a bonus of (5% AP)% to your health.  This way you need AP to get the bonus effect of it but without a high AP it's useless.  Then tanks avoid buying it for bonuses and mages can't buy it just for huge bonuses and no drawback.\n\nNothing else I'd love to see scaling factors on weapons.  It makes more sense to say that a sword would give you +45*AD Factor instead of a flat 100 damage.  If a champ is AD heavy then their AD factor is higher, say put it at 2.5 (makes the item give 112.5 AD) but if a champ is designed for speed not damage (like Yi) then a lower AD factor of say 1.6 balances out with a higher Attack Speed factor (and the item would give only 72AD).\n\nI think it opens up a world of possibilities for balance where we aren't having a problem where one item is being abused by someone that shouldn't have bought it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Woook3r","date":"2016-07-27T21:49:40.107+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"This post was not only wrong, it was stupid and self contradictory.

No more lifesteal shield or excessive healing. Tanks now don't oneshot carries by building tanks, they kill them with sustained damage.\n\nRight now everyone is building damage because except for a few items, damage=defense, and raw tank builds are inferior when behind but oppressive when ahead because they have CC tanks bursting carries like assassins but you also have carries with a couple items having more tankiness, shred, and damage than someone struggling to build defensive items.\n\nSee the problem?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Poske","date":"2016-07-26T03:44:31.309+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":35,"body":"Such a big wall Of post yet you are just outright wrong\n\nIf we assume that Champion power budget in 2010 was 30 000 (Random number)\nNowdays its around 20 000\n\n\nSorry to dissapoint you but there is no damage creep in league. \n\n\nRiot has been nerfing Champions since  league of legends came out \n\nList me 1 patch where most of the changes are buffs rather then nerfs..

The problem isn't tanks, tanks are goddamn useless, I can't even remember the last time I saw a champ build only defense.  Even {{champion:57}}  and {{champion:54}} , the most stereotypically tank champs, have to get at least an {{item:3001}}  to even be relevant.  Tank meta is not a thing, the tanks just hold people down so the carries do the killing, they're glorified CC bots.  Before you say it, yes that's the idea, but they're also supposed to be a major threat on the battlefield, whereas now they just get ignored after they already used their ults.  Tanks are supposed to, hey, tank damage, not be ignored until the fight is already over.  When most people say Tank meta, what they mean is Bruiser meta, building damage then full tank.  A true tank will not get a single damage item, as they don't need to.  They're a bullet sponge, not a nuke.  {{champion:86}} is not a true tank, {{champion:420}} is not a true tank, {{champion:48}} is not a true tank.  True tanks are these guys: {{champion:154}} {{champion:106}} {{champion:44}} {{champion:223}} {{champion:14}} {{champion:27}} {{champion:98}} {{champion:113}} {{champion:421}} {{champion:33}} {{champion:78}} {{champion:2}} {{champion:57}} {{champion:54}} {{champion:36}} {{champion:12}}   And the only reason you ever see any of these is because they don't build full tank, they build an {{item:3001}} , or a {{item:3071}} , because they have no choice but to have damage so they aren't useless.\n\nThe problem is things like lifesteal.  I'm perfectly okay with a late-game ADC shredding through tanks, that's their job after all; but when they HEAL during a fight while the tank is unloading everything they have, there's a problem.  Hell, Riot took out spell vamp because it was \"OP\", but honestly, think about this:\n\n   1. Auto attacks are free, no mana cost, no cooldowns\n\n   2. Auto attacks can crit, which can make a Caitlyn do more damage with a single auto than an entire Lux ult\n\n   3. Auto attacks apply on-hit effects, like {{item:3153}} {{item:1419}} {{item:3022}} {{item:3057}} \n\n   4. Auto attacks can heal the user, for free\n\nIn contrast, mages for example have:\n\n   1. High damage spells, cost mana(usually{{champion:8}} ) and have cooldowns\n\n   2. Only certain spells can apply on-hit effects{{champion:81}} \n\n   3. Spells cannot crit, they will always deal predictable damage (bar TLD, which is also a huge problem)\n\n   4. Spells can BARELY heal a select few champs, or with the right runes/masteries, while also having a cooldown and costing mana\n\nI propose the outright removal of lifesteal from items, except for {{item:3072}} , which should have an effect to heal for a chunk of damage on a relatively long cooldown (30 sec).  {{item:3153}}  should lose the lifesteal and get more AD to compensate.  {{item:3074}}  needs to drop the lifesteal and just give some CDR.  {{item:3812}}  is whatever, it's effect is pretty unique and cool. {{item:3139}}  does such a powerful item REALLY need lifesteal?(#MakeQSSGreatAgain)\n\nA marksman going into a fight and coming out with more health than they started with is just absurd.

This is literally what Riot's said for years about why they prefer to nerf rather than buff - that nerfing one OP champ introduces less creep than buffing all of its competition.  This is why Zed's been tweaked more times in a couple months than Galio's been buffed in a couple years.\n\nItems offering both defensive and offensive stats isn't a problem, and the only difference between building 2 mixed items and buying 1 pure offense item with one pure defense item is the timing at which you hit the balance.  I've seen very few people complaining about this problem at first item (most of the supposed Rylai's abusers aren't rushing it).  Also, the fact that people are complaining about Rylai's, but not about RoA - a _cheaper_ item with _more_ HP - should tell you something about what Rylai's problem is (if it has one at all).\n\n**Reducing ALL damage is:**\n_Ridiculous_ - When's the last time ANYTHING in the game has been changed by 20%?\n_Overreactionary_ - What suddenly caused damage to be 20% higher this season?\n_Not a targeted solution_ - Do you honestly think all champs need their damage nerfed the same amount?\n\nNow the part tank mains hate hearing:  Risk/reward is a real thing in the game, and the ADC who builds all glass should outscale the tank who builds full defense.  This isn't saying tanks should be bad at tanking, this is saying that you can't build a balanced game where there's no incentive to choose the riskier build (ADC's) over the safe build (tank's).  On top of that, you need to have classes be weak to other classes, just like rock-paper-scissors.  Who's supposed to beat tanks?  It's ADCs.  \n\nI actually agree that damage is too high, but I think you're looking in all of the wrong places.  If you want to do damage, you should have to actually build damage, however Riot's been spoonfeeding tanks %HP damage, they put thunderlord's/grasp/fervor in the game, and the IBG/Sunfire builds from this season are a perfect example of getting damage without committing to building it.  CDR is one of the most underrated DPS stats in the game, yet it's not a solely offensive stat but instead increases utility/mobility/even durability in some cases.  \n\nTihs is very different from something like Rylai's, where even if the item has both offense and defense, you still have to pay for the offense (and Rylai's stat efficiency isn't remarkable for its price point, even considering the slow's gold value).  After all, Ekko was far more successful building IBG/sunfire than he ever was building the offense/defense AP items, even after his ratios got buffed.  Sure, he got nerfed, but before he got nerfed he still wasn't building these offense/defense AP items.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tobias Brackner","date":"2016-07-26T05:04:15.460+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":6,"body":"So, here's the thing.\n\nIdk about dmg creep being a bad thing.\n\nPersonally I'm happier with people building dmg and survivability across the board cuz so long as the dmg wins out you get more explosive games where there is a lot of set up and one huge push, which I also like cuz that can mean shorter games too.","replies":[{"poster":"Dextix LT","date":"2016-07-26T15:25:42.342+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"And this ends up in stomp games.

The problem with league at the moment is that damage items are inseparable from tank stats. Most bruiser/damage items include health of some kind.

This leads to the problem that when you're ahead, you're simultaneously building defense and offense, which is fucking bullshit.
