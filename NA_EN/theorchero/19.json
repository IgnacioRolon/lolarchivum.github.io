He's not opressive and can be out played and countered so why the hate for him? You know that saying that the enemy picking him means an automatic loss for you is a bit untrue right?\n\nHis popularity goes up quite a bit the further you go up in elo but his winrate is still ~50 percent? Why don't you have this kind of hatred for ivern? Is it because he's not as popular? Because he has a 55+ winrate from gold up. Have you ever considered that the reason that people play lee is not because he's strong but because they just genuinly like the champion?\n\nWhy don't you hate thresh? Is it because he's a support. He has always been a bit strong. No, let me rephrase that. Popular. He has a 26% winrate from gold upwards. \n\nLet me show you something. These three champions - {{champion:236}} {{champion:51}}  and {{champion:81}} have playrates of 35.3%, 26.4% and 24.3% respectively. That is a combined play rate of 86% for **ONE ROLE**!\nhttp://www.leagueofgraphs.com/\nAnd one of them has a play rate just 2% off from lee's.\n\nSo why aren't you saying anything about them? Is it because no one else is? I don't understand what you want riot to actually fix. He's not strong. He's just popular. They nerfed him a few patches ago but his winrate steadily *rose* so its definately not his strength that's the problem. I think it's just that people like playing him. And nerfing him soley on that is kinda unfair for the people who like to play him.\n\nJust to clarify I'm not salty or anything. Never played Lee Sin in my life. I just genuinly want to know the answers to the questions I asked and what is you end game? Jungle isn't a very diverse role (well it's more diverse than bot anyways) but if Lee get's nerfed isn't someone else just going to dominate? Are you sure what you're asking for is balance and not self satisfaction? Well I wouldn't say self satisfaction because I don't think even have of the people who 'hate' Lee Sin would do so if everyone else didn't. So, yeah. I've said alot, sorry (^_^').
