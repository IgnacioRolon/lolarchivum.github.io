You literally banned a fucking PILLAR of this community. BFNA doesn&#039;t harass people. He doesn&#039;t wish them cancer, he doesn&#039;t circlejerk, he doesn&#039;t spam, he doesn&#039;t do any of the reprehensible SHIT that gives you a fucking JOB.\r\n\r\n&quot;For all of maybe 30 minutes before i found out who she was; i dont stick my dick in crazy&quot;\r\n\r\nReally mods. Really? This isn&#039;t even a direct insult. On top of that, **this person was literally spamming the entire fucking boards and pissing everyone off.** You banned Ezreal Wright&#039;s smurf SUPER fucking quick, like 30 seconds flat. But this person? Naw, fuck it. Sure, mod bias doesn&#039;t exist. lol ok.","replies":[]}
