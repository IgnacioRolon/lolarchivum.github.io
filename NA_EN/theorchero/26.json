So its if you can't zerg the adc down then they will kill you in the fight.  Even at lower levels I fill like the power of ADC's is really strong.  Maybe its just AD in general is strong.  But now you have Janna that shield and give ad.  But then you can't jump on the adc because of her ult.  So in the game where ADC burst is way too high it makes sense she is op.  Because the adc will 3 shot you and her shields are huge.  Then 2 cc's behind it.  Then the AD from the shield is really a lot.  Its like a free BF sword at max levels.  that is crazy.\n\natm shield ratio needs to be 45% instead of 70% and the ad needs to be cut in Half cd moved to 15 secs instead of 10.\n\nShield in general needs to be cut in half to 2/3 and increase the duration by 50% to 25%.  Heals need to do 75% now and 25% as a hot.\n\nRight not with 45% cd.  She only had .5 sec where the shield will not be on.  Then you look at how much is shields for and its crazy.
