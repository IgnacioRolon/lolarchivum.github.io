What motions are to be discussed today?\r\n\r\nhttp://videomatic3.diskstation.me/~worreh/avatar/na/Ezreal%20Wright.png Gut the freelo explorer!\r\n\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/TWSvvFP.jpg Sorry that's not the approved list. Next!\r\n\r\nhttp://videomatic3.diskstation.me/~worreh/avatar/na/Ezreal%20Wright.png Wait wait wait wait! I mean, can we nerf Nidalee?\r\n\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/TWSvvFP.jpg That's an interesting idea. Jatt?\r\n\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/ioHftPW.png LCS BIG PLAYS!\r\n\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/TWSvvFP.jpg You heard him, we aren't nerfing Nidalee.\r\n\r\nhttp://videomatic3.diskstation.me/~worreh/avatar/na/Ezreal%20Wright.png Can we at least fix her invisible spears? Disable her until it's fixed?\r\n\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/TWSvvFP.jpg That sounds like a major nerf. Hold on, let me do some calculations to her compensation.\r\n\r\nhttp://videomatic3.diskstation.me/~worreh/avatar/na/Ezreal%20Wright.png Wait, what? NO FORGET I SAID ANYTH-\r\n\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/TWSvvFP.jpg Ah, there we go. *Leans into microphone* **In light of recent bugfixes that make her spear harder to land, we have decided to compensate Nidalee for when she does land them. When she lands them they now deal 20% of the targets missing health after initial damage calculation. And since this might affect her lane sustain, she now heals for the damage dealt.**\r\n\r\nhttp://videomatic3.diskstation.me/~worreh/avatar/na/Ezreal%20Wright.png WHAT?\r\n\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/TWSvvFP.jpg Next issue!\r\n\r\n--\r\nhttps://avatar.leagueoflegends.com/na/Raleko.png Sir, I think we should nerf Nasus' wither.\r\n\r\nhttp://videomatic3.diskstation.me/~worreh/avatar/na/Crabby.gif Can we talk about Soraka buffs?\r\n\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/TWSvvFP.jpg One issue at a time, please.\r\n\r\nhttp://videomatic3.diskstation.me/~worreh/avatar/na/HateDaddy.jpg Ser Bacon, as a Nasus main I believe I have the right to speak in this forum of discourse. Nasus is a balanced champion with a high skillca-\r\n\r\nhttp://videomatic3.diskstation.me/~worreh/avatar/na/Ezreal%20Edgeworth.png Gut the freelo Explorer!\r\n\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/TWSvvFP.jpg Ezreal, that's the second time you've interrupted our talk. Do it again and I'll buff the living shit out of graves.\r\n\r\nhttp://videomatic3.diskstation.me/~worreh/avatar/na/Ezreal%20Wright.png Wtf?\r\n\r\nhttp://videomatic3.diskstation.me/~worreh/avatar/na/HateDaddy.jpg I think Wither needs buffs. It should start in reverse and drain movement speed instead of just slowing.\r\n\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/TWSvvFP.jpg I'm going to need additional help on this one. Analyst desk?\r\n\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/ioHftPW.png Fantasy lolsports!\r\n\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/WNQqw0S.png Buff trinity force!\r\n\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/AWEo5g0.jpg Wither is INSANE PLAYS!\r\n\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/WXIWo6I.jpg Let's be reasonable here, we should really buff Wither.\r\n\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/JcMX9yO.jpg Look at my hands, they're forming a gesture at Nasus players.\r\n\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/HR5oO4U.png I think the Korean teams are going to be really strong this year.\r\n\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/44IzIbz.jpg Nerf Irelia.\r\n\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/TWSvvFP.jpg Okay, so we need to buff Esports. Let's nerf Irelia and buff trinity force and implement the wither suggestions.\r\n\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/ePsnxDg.png *Hatedaddy IRL*\r\n\r\n--","replies":[]}
