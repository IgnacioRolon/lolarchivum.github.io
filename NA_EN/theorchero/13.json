I was trying to do the same and understand the new rune pages and was just like why is this quiet but just loud enough to hear music playing. I guess previous to the patch I must've kept my sound quieter because I don't recall hearing it prior to it, but like you I was watching videos so my sound was louder and it wouldn't stop. Went crazy trying to figure out how to stop it, couldn't figure out a way except muting all sound effects, got annoyed, and turned off league without finishing my pages. What's funny is when I first log on I dont hear it, it's when I start clicking around on crap like the rune pages at some point I'll just hear it start playing.
