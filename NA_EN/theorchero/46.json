Then you'll realize how insane his mana regeneration is from chimes.\r\n\r\nHis problem IMO is that it takes too many chimes to scale to the point that your passive is useful. It does excellent poke damage but the important bit, the aoe large slow, is hard to come by until really late game. They need to reduce the thresholds of chime requirements and then slightly slow the spawn rate. Improving where they spawn is also ideal. They can often spawn in the enemy jungle at 12 minutes where it's super fucking risky to collect them. I'd like to see the chimes grant a larger MS boost and then decay so that they are useful to collect during an escape.\r\n\r\nHis ultimate is situational, but his Q range needs to be buffed a little bit.\r\n\r\nApart from passive tweaks and range on Q I find he's in a good spot.\r\n\r\nPotential Solutions\r\n\r\n    Increase Chime spawns/safety or reduce requirements for bonuses\r\n    Increased Q range\r\n    Make his W more mana efficient by increasing the movement speed bonus over the duration as well\r\n\r\nThese are just a few solutions I've thought of. I think overall Bard is in a good spot, but his weakness in his mana inefficient W is his biggest problem. It's movement speed doesn't scale, has shit base heal, and takes 10 seconds to heal for a half decent amount. The tradeoff of leaving it somewhere doesn't matter because past super early levels the heal amount is literally irrelevant. The main reason I believe the cost is so high is because otherwise he'd spam it too much because of the insane mana regen his chimes offer. However, they can provide additional incentive to let it charge by increasing the MS over time and buffing the bases a little. I mean really, there's ZERO reason to max it second because it's base and scaling is so shit. Sure the travel time on E is kinda nice but the main reason I max it second is because W is useless to put points into.","replies":[]}
