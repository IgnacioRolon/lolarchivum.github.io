Why does Raptor buff, which is exceedingly powerful even if you don't have it procing from any ward because you know that area is clear of vision, also let you know of a Pink ward? IMO, pinks should counter Raptor because they are already visible. They're really easy to kill, but at the same time they are permanent.\r\n\r\n In addition I think it will help junglers in ways they need it most: Raptor buffs are generally used for ganking - it lets you know if the enemy laner knows you are there. It feels equally shitty for a jungler to \"waste\" the raptor buff on a pink ward, because they are probably going to find it anyway because it's visible. So when they go to gank, they can't clear wards from the enemy laner. So make Raptor buff only proc on invisible, green wards.\r\n\r\nThoughts?","replies":[]}
