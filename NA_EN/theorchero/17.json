But that's fine, because other boot choices like Mobis and company were actually viable, and they cost more, so it was a real opportunity cost to doing so. The reason knockups were created and introduced like they were was to accentuate a CC-orientated champion's kit in such a way so that their CRITICAL contribution would not be negated by tenacity. Alistar for example, prior to his WQ combo being mainstream, pretty much just Q'd in the teamfight at a relatively low cooldown. His entire contribution was his Q, so it had a knockup so that he wasn't useless.\n\nMalphite, similarly, had his ult be a knockup so it's not useless.\n\nBut now everyone and their mother has displacements that cannot be reduced via tenacity. Even if you QSS the \"stun\" you still can't move while being knocked up, you can only flash. Now, not only is tenacity basically useless because every champion whose given a 1s or more CC has a knockup that isn't reduced via tenacity, other boot options are garbage, so we're forced to go to the only decent options left.\n\nTabis aren't crazy strong, they're just the only decent boots for someone whose not a mage or an adc.","replies":[{"poster":"Ariel the Cruel","date":"2017-08-07T20:44:01.801+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":">Knockups were specifically designed to counter tenacity \n\nActually.
