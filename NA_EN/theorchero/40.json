This is","subforum":"General Discussion","up_votes":9,"down_votes":2,"body":"- pretty much how the conversation went.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n&quot;Why do you want to barrel the backline?&quot;\r\n\r\nOk, imagine this.\r\n\r\nYou have paintball gun. It fires paintballs. Paintballs can fucking hurt or seriously injure if you don&#039;t have any protection from said paintballs. It&#039;s why you don&#039;t go play with paintballs without a mask unless you want to be a pirate irl and wear a fuckin eyepatch the rest of your life.\r\n\r\nNow, your barrels are like that paintball gun, except with limited shots. Now these paintballs can either fucking **hurt** or do absolutely jack shit depending on your aim. You know tanks, right? Fuckers who build shit like Randuins and Tabi who are like &quot;Teehee I&#039;m a great player because I build two items that effectively reduce critplank&#039;s damage by 35% in addition to armor so that I take 350 damage from a 2k crit barrel.&quot;\r\n\r\nNow in Paintball, we&#039;re gonna think of this guy like an empire in Baseball. He&#039;s heavily padded, and for some goddamn reason he&#039;s huge and fat because his mother liked football jockeys so they&#039;re rich and have giant ass, tall kids so this dickhead is 6&#039;2, black, with shit tons of body armor. Oh, and he&#039;s equipped with a Tiberius T4.1 automatic paintball gun. All of his paintball shots hurt like a bitch, he fires a fuckton of them, but none of them can necessarily kill or maim you easily. If you shoot this guy with your little paintball gun it&#039;s not going to do much more than piss him off, possibly making him target your dumb ass instead of a teammate&#039;s dumb ass.\r\n\r\nYou&#039;re probably thinking something along the lines of, &quot;But Theo, isn&#039;t that guy like, a major threat? He sounds like he&#039;s really hard to kill and those paintballs fucking hurt.&quot;\r\n\r\nSure, he&#039;s a decent threat. Early. Later on once you get some items, such as a trinity force or a better paintball gun, your shots are going to hurt. But it won&#039;t matter because that fat fuck is walking around with a couch on his body for protection. He won&#039;t feel shit. Now, what you really want to do, is target the big fatties *little brother*, because while yes the big fatties paintball gun hurts, that little fucker is actually firing rubber bullets. They hurt like a bitch, but still won&#039;t kill you. His little brother is a smart little shit. He&#039;s skinny as fuck and isn&#039;t strong enough to carry around a mattress for a shirt so he&#039;s a little pussy and hides behind his fatass brother for protection or up a tree and rain down hell on you from afar, and the little fucker aims for places like your nuts or your neck so he can cause huge amounts of pain and fatal injuries. \r\n\r\nIt gets worse, though. See, after paintball this little shit is going to grow up and take Daddy&#039;s football money to go and buyout the factory where all of his school bullies work just to explicitly put them out of work, because fuck them that&#039;s why. He&#039;s this little scaling motherfucker and you want to prevent him from inheriting Daddy&#039;s money as much as possible, so your goal in life is to shoot that little shit in the nuts so much that they are traumatized to the point that they become a trigendered pyrofox and no football father in the history of manhood would ever let himself die knowing that that little weird shit inherited his money.\r\n\r\nSo yeah, just barrel the squishies to win the fight and keep them from cleaning up and snowballing.","replies":[]}
