There&#039;s literally 0 reason to use this ability anymore beyond clearing camps because it&#039;s damage is useless and it&#039;s marking is unreliable at best. In only two or three situations is vision control via trapping really viable because of it&#039;s short duration.\n\nOn top of this, the Q cast time now just feels unnecessarily clunky. **I&#039;m okay with the damage nerfs.** I just want to be able to see shit when I put a trap for fucking vision. This has been a hallmark for her identity since her initial release and shouldn&#039;t have been removed.\n\nhttps://i.gyazo.com/beef6dcc8816e58963ce1fe46775d0b6.png\n\nhttp://champion.gg/champion/Nidalee/Middle","replies":[]}
