Warrior alone adds 120+108+60 damage to his rotation, because all of his ratios are bonus AD and the total ratio roundup is a 4.8 bonus AD ratio.   Not counting the fact that you can weave autos in on some of those parts of the combo, like directly after a kick and during the Q jump animation.  Add in Titanic Hydra and you have a little shy of 100 bonus AD from items (Or 480 bonus damage on the combo, not counting Titanic proc which is variable depending on how much of the rest of his build he has finished), as well as runes and masteries to give him more damage into the combo.   1 AD item, one bruiser item, and full tank, and he has more reliable damage than any assassin almost.\n\n\nI think the two biggest changes Lee needs is faintly tuned down damage, and to not have a top tier base move speed on a champion who already has mid-top tier mobility.  He can run at you faster than just about any champ can run away, and can pretty much force a flash just by the nature of his presence in lane.  I'm fine with Lee having flashy plays, but he shouldn't just stat-stick vs you either, and base move speed is just a stat-stick method of beating you.

If late game fall-off was as valid as people said, then that should decay to a 45% win rate late game for it to be of equal value.
