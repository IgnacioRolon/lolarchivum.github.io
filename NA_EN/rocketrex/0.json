Two reasons:\n\n1) This would make her even MORE like Ziggs ;P\n\n2) If W becomes a guaranteed safety tool, eventually good Taliyah players would be discouraged from using the ability offensively (because always being able to survive is so much more valuable).","replies":[{"poster":"Im just too OP","date":"2016-07-07T21:04:25.697+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nah, I gotta disagree with it. Dont get me wrong, but for first one: Its nothing like Ziggs! Ziggs puts down a bomb which he can detonate manually and has to position himself. Taliyah will have a fraction over a second that will clearly depend on which way the vector is. Against a Yasuo, and i'd say he should be able to ult (come on its a flippin knock up. whats better than that for yasuo. it can also be a weakness for that long looked nerf to her.) On the second one: They are pretty much forced to use this ability OFFENSIVELY! because of the so famous W-E combo. If they use it to escape, it barely becomes any useful for them to inflict any damage to the enemy. They might use it to dodge certain enemy attacks that are very slow, but that cd on it should pay them for their full combo. Hope u see this. AND NO OFFENCE to u zenon. u still my g.","replies":[]},{"poster":"redfeenix","date":"2016-07-06T23:18:02.222+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Double post sorry ","replies":[]},{"poster":"redfeenix","date":"2016-07-06T23:20:00.063+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"Hopefully these changes make her fun. I think her skills alright but her personality/character is very bland.

Don't think we havd room for bland characters like Talia in our game. Esp not these days.\n\nThink the w , e could been way better if you didn't just copy zigs.
