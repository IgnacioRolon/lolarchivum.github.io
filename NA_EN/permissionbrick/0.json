Permanently reduces enemies stats for no reason, until they are out of combat. \r\n**W: Buffing shield**.

He then spawns right where he was and as he was. He has no vision or chat during that time.\r\n\r\nInstead of Mana he has an RP bar.","replies":[{"poster":"5000000000000000","date":"2015-05-12T05:46:00.752+0000","up_votes":23,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Although Sir Rito is a support champion, I play him in the jungle.\"\n-Phreak","replies":[{"poster":"HAIL WHYDRA","date":"2015-05-12T15:08:28.106+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"I like to build {{item:3078}} so I can deal tons of damage.\"","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"XehanÃ¶rt","date":"2015-05-12T14:47:34.525+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":1,"body":">R: The Tribunal\n\nHis ultimate has probably a 2 years cooldown.","replies":[{"poster":"Hatless Casual","date":"2015-05-12T16:36:20.440+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":1,"body":"And does little to nothing.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"thePandev","date":"2015-05-11T23:09:37.700+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"You forgot his secret ability:\n\n **T: Never forget.** Awards all enemies 1000 RP, and brings Riot Nasus back into your game, while Pendragon turns your game into a thread about dogs.","replies":[{"poster":"Voishin","date":"2015-05-12T17:59:07.326+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=rexman189,realm=NA,application-id=2XjzURgc,discussion-id=Bj9o3iNA,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-05-11T23:09:37.700+0000)\n>\n> You forgot his secret ability:\n> \n>  **T: Never forget.** Awards all enemies 1000 RP, and brings Riot Nasus back into your game, while Pendragon turns your game into a thread about dogs.\n\nThe dogs post was one of the many... let's go with \"unpleasant\" Tamat posts, not Pendragon's.

Darnit Rito.\n\nBeen playing avidly for 2.5 years. Still missing 20+ champs and quite a few runes. If you don't think this game is at least a little bit pay to win then you need to wake up. I hate when people act like this billion dollar company is a charity, like they give us a FtP game out of the goodness of their hearts and not for profit.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Sugar Momma","date":"2015-05-12T12:40:22.126+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Gave me a good laugh this morning!

Keep your spirits high.  When life gives you curdled milk, be patient. You get very good cheese!  No time for worrying.  These are keys to victory.  You can always trust Braum!  Do not disregard the attitude you bring to the game.  If you believe you can do well, you can do well!  Is that simple.  Mindset is key in any game.  Skill is good, yes, but you must first believe in yourself.  \n\nTreat each game as practice, even ranked.  Try to always do better than the last one.  Push yourself, but know your limits.  Feel like you are on tilt?  Play a bot game.  People are silly there.  You see many goofs and off-meta things, but in the end everyone enjoys themselves.  Is lots of fun.  Bots do not teach skill, but they let you have fun.  This is a game after all!  In a bad mood?  Relax.  Log off for a bit.  Play a different game for a while.  League of Legends is a game, but it can be stressful.  Sometimes Poros are easier to herd than teammates...  When you feel yourself getting too frustrated at yours (teammates or Poros), finish the game you are in, then go find a distraction somewhere else.  You may think you are worthy of being a pro, and you may yet be.  In spite of asking for what is basically elo-boosting, you may actually have skill yourself.  Never forget that.  But also do not forget that you are NOT a Pro.  You do not rely on games for money and you probably started playing to have fun.  Keep that in mind.  This is a game.  Play for fun or to relieve stress.  Never let it cause stress for you.  You will find that you do better with this in mind.  I guarantee it.  \n\nAs for payment...  I think 100 Poro-Snax per win is good, yes?  :}D","replies":[]}]}]}
