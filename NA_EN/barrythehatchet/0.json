There are a few things we know about her:\r\n\r\n1.  She's from the void\r\n2.  Her Runeterra home is the Shurima Desert.\r\n3.  Non-Verbal monster.  Communicates with clicks, calls, and various other monster sounds.  Possibly non-sentient, instinct based creature.  The first of the void champions\r\n4.  Feared by Shurima denizens for generations.\r\n\r\nHow did she get her name?  All other void creatures can communicate, and are self aware.  They know their names.  Is she part of a larger pack of creatures?  Would they be Rek'Sai as well?\r\n\r\nDid the people of Shurima name her?  She's been around long enough that she's pretty much a legend.  Honestly, I doubt it.  They would have to be pretty lucky to get her name with the apostrophe in her name.  Maybe they literally just refer to her as \"The Terror of the Deep\".  Cool, that's fine.\r\n\r\nI'm sure her crossing over will be explained.  But basically, how does an apparently non sentient creature get a proper name.  It would be like the Lock Ness Monster showing up one day and saying \"Hey, guys.  It's Frank.  My name is Frank.  Jesus\", before going back under water.\r\n\r\nIt may seem like a small thing, but I think names are important as they confer identity and direction.\r\n\r\nHoping a red chimes in, or someone with some semblance of an answer.\r\n\r\nThanks guys,\r\nSongslinger","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2014-11-27T07:35:12.242+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not my area of expertise, so do recommend asking these questions in the Q&A about her (which is likely to be either next week or the week after at a guess).

Like, that or the other void creatures can understand Rek'sai.
