The question I have is why was Kled's skin 1350 RP for around the first hour he was out. When my brother and I where having a discussion on Kled's skin, he mentioned it was worth 975 RP, but I then thought it was 1350, so I closed the client, and re-opened to find that it was changed to 975. I was upset then because the bundle was costing around 1800 RP, and now it is around 1400 RP, so I basically lost 400 RP. \r\nI also have a question on the Sir Kled skin. Why is it that when he throws his Bear Trap on a Rope, it looks like a hook, but when it hits a target, it is just a bear trap. \r\nI hope someone can answer me","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-11T21:11:41.624+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kled's skin was meant to go out for the right price at 975 RP but initially went out at 1350 RP due to an error on our end. We're taking care of those who had bought it at the 1350RP price or in the more expensive bundle.
