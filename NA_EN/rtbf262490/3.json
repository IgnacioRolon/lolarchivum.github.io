Combine 2 tokens to advance further.  I have 11 guys at s- and higher but no tokens for a long time. The wording needs to change if we cannot get a Mastery 6 token in ARAM then that needs to be added to the wording. Because the way it reads to me is I should have a lot of tokens and a lot of guys at Mastery 6. But I have 21 at Mastery 5 because I have no tokens.","replies":[{"poster":"TheLastShadow45","date":"2017-07-30T19:52:54.439+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can only earn mastery tokens on SR normal and ranked matches.","replies":[{"poster":"rtbf262490","date":"2017-07-31T00:21:01.842+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=TheLastShadow45,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=7UBo2msd,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2017-07-30T19:52:54.439+0000)\n>\n> You can only earn mastery tokens on SR normal and ranked matches.\n\nYes but it does not say that in the wording on the page though, It needs to be clarified.","replies":[{"poster":"TheLastShadow45","date":"2017-07-31T01:54:16.265+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually it does.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Warmanreaper","date":"2017-07-30T16:26:12.103+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"I have shit loads of tokens, but no essence.. the essence is my problem.

Then, take those 2 tokens and combine them with either blue essence or the champ shard/perm to level them up to Mastery 6.

If you want people to read the the entire explanation then put the entire explanation!  In it.  Maybe add a link you know so we understand better not 2 different explanation's. So maybe now you can word it better. Thanks, look forward to a better explanation.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ben Dover666","date":"2018-01-24T06:11:33.772+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Broporo,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=7UBo2msd,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2017-07-31T00:21:43.667+0000)\n>\n> Ahhhh sorry that you read the [**Champion Mastery**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204211284#h1q5) section incorrectly!
