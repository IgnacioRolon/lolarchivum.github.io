When i got back to the main launch application to play again i had 38 rp. And of course there wasn't any charges for it it's a glitch it just took it. I don't want the rp i want this fixed that's it i want nothing but that. Please someone needs to check this it is happening it is rare but it does happen.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-11T16:00:39.636+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd like to us to investigate further to see what happened.

Thank you so much for writing in with your concerns. Sorry about the delay! I've checked our system and it appears that there was a slight glitch with your skin boost. Normally when skin boosts are queued the RP from the purchase isn't removed from an account until after the game has been played(which generally stops the charge is a person queue dodges after the boost purchase was made).\n\nHowever, in your case it appears that you were charged even though someone dodged. Not to worry though as I've credited 95 RP to your account for this mistake. Enjoy!\n\nIf you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to ask!\n\nWeeezing\nBilling and Account Support\n\"You are all free now!\"\n\n\n(YAY i am not crazy it was a glitch!)","replies":[]},{"poster":"rtbf262490","date":"2016-08-11T16:17:01.991+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Targons Blade,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=fQrEiEVR,comment-id=000100000000,timestamp=2016-08-11T16:00:39.636+0000)\n>\n> I&#x27;d like to us to investigate further to see what happened.

But it is also hard to catch it i tried recording for a long time after but it seems to only happen with a specific time or moment when someone bails as you buy the boost. I am no coder or try to act like i know anything about this process but the people that deal with this kind of issue must realize that there are bugs that are hard to catch or pop up only under certain circumstances. I suck at typing as you can see but i hope that when you read this i am sincerely and honestly trying to help you guys catch this rare thing that is happening.

I wanted it to stay at 38 until this process had been looked at closely, i think you guys get so many people that give you stories to get rp that when one comes across that's genuine it just goes the way of all the others.","replies":[]}]}
