May I remind you that ranked and the season will end in November at some time also told to us in an earlier red post. This information makes sense because they want to roll in all the new infrastructure with the coming new season and so on and so forth but what about this season? \r\n\r\nI play with 70 Mb/s download and 45 Mb/s upload. I have had 0 issues with my isp in the past when it comes to playing league of legends in any fashion like some members have with Comcast etc. With the recent talk of the issue from Riot I can pretty much say It is Riot's influence through their server issues that is causing me to have constant Ping and lag issues mid game often times resulting in an \"Attempting to Reconnect\" the past few weeks.  I however am not alone.\r\n\r\nThe point I am trying to make is why is it that a company this large is basically telling its vastly large player base to sit on their hands if they are affected for a whole month. Players just like you and me who were, before the server issues, trying to rank up before the end of the season, or just overall play. We have been reduced to a fear of playing ranked as we don't want to lose due to a disconnect or a fear of even playing because of the leaver system. \r\n\r\nTo give you guys a bit of reference I know quite a few people that have recently gotten penalties because they were unable to reconnect to a game for 40 minutes and were put as \"Leaver\" instead of a server related problem that results in a Loss Prevented. I also know first hand that Ranked play is out of the question as seen by my 3 losses in a row due to server instability, and yes I know some of you will say just don't play ranked but I wanted to see whether or not the attempting to reconnects were just a passing thing or if they were a more permanent nightmare. I tried early morning, Mid afternoon, and late late at night all with issues in every single one to test whether or not the issues arise during peak server times. \r\n\r\nBottom line is this. With a player base this large I understand that any issue that comes up and Riot has to address will never satisfy everyone. Is completely practical for them to say that they want to institute these changes when they can and them coinciding around the time that the season ends I get that. I also don't want to make Riot out to be a Money hungry monster that is just sitting on their ass and getting around to problems when they feel like it. They are a business and the changes to LOL in Season 5 look amazing. I just feel that Season 4 is getting overlooked her at the end and those players unable to hit the next rank they are looking for, players unable to even play for a month due to issues or just overall fear of getting banned or issues some sort of punishment for not being able to reconnect to games, or just the overall issues of lag and such in games should not be swept under the rug. This is the end of the season and I know we are looking towards the future but there has to be something that can be done if anything. \r\n\r\nAlso in a more selfish proposition, GIVE US EAST COAST SERVERS! \r\n\r\ntl;dr : These server issues suck. Ranked and general play are highly affected. People can't rank up before season ends. People are getting banned or have issues with {{summoner:11}}  punishment after leaver system gets ahold of them due to riot server issues. Give us an East coast server plox.","replies":[{"poster":"redniwediS","date":"2014-10-07T16:08:15.836+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They are not just fixing the server problems in November, they are giving us 100% new servers.  Brand new stuff to play on that will work well for longer than a bandaid to the current system will hold.  They know there are issues, they even (mostly) removed demotion due to inactivity for silver and gold players.","replies":[{"poster":"HipsterVegeta","date":"2014-10-07T16:10:28.364+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well like I said I know they will be doing allot of server related changes and migration to new ones including new processes that will ultimately cut down on lag and issues overall. All I am saying is that they are basically telling people to sit on their hands for a month or so. All the while people are unable to play or getting demoted/banned for issues involving the servers with no fault of their own.","replies":[{"poster":"redniwediS","date":"2014-10-07T16:14:24.677+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's obviously not a good situation, but they have put measures in place to protect end of season rewards.  It's not their fault if people attempt to play while they are being hit by connectivity issues, only to be targeted by the automated leaver system.","replies":[{"poster":"HipsterVegeta","date":"2014-10-07T16:17:30.236+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Protect gained rewards (To an extent). If you are a high level player, Plat + you are not protected. Along with this if you are trying to make it to challenger or something like that you are unable to. Trying to grind out to Diamond or something before the end of the season is not uncommon at all but now people are unable to. On top of this that logic means that people should just not play the game for a month. Saying that if they don't want to face the leaver system they should not play, when it isn't even their fault. Also people were banned when the problem began. So they had their account banned for no reason without even knowing there was server issues.","replies":[{"poster":"redniwediS","date":"2014-10-07T16:22:45.321+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if they were truly banned for no reason they should make a support ticket.\n\nNow, at the end of the day this is just a game.  A very competitive game, but a game.  I personally think Riot should turn off all inactivity decay no matter what rank you are, but the only reward for anything above gold is a loading screen border.  That's not what I would call a high priority issue.\n\nPeople who know they have connection issues should not be playing ranked.  With or without the current server problems this is something I personally believe.  If there is a high probability of a permanent DC then you are more of a detriment to your team than anything else.","replies":[{"poster":"HipsterVegeta","date":"2014-10-07T16:30:03.040+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well it isn't just about the reward in terms of the things given by Riot. People play ranked to get towards being one of the top players. I mean if people were just worried about rewards they would go play 5's and 3's. It is more about the border and climbing the ranks towards the top imo. I do agree that outside of Challenger and Master tier that decay shouldn't be around though. You made it that far with all of the pitfalls and possible trolls why not get to keep your rank as long as you don't lose out. Keeping Challenger and Master tiers cycled though is still a good idea so people dont afk people from getting into the top tiers.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
