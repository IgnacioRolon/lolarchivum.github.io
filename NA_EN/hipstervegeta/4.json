Ive had 4 4v5's in my last 10 games with Disconnects/Ragequits for more than 10 minutes-entire game and there is just no winning the game if the enemy team doesn't go insane and throw the game horribly, especially when it is a disconnect from the start. I don't see why we can't have a reduction on LP loss when this is the case instead of losing 18 a game when there is literally nothing you can do. I understand putting something out there that is a blanket people could say \"just disconnect to reduce our LP loss\" but if its more than 10 minutes I don't see the issue. Put a time limit on it allowing it to be a pretty obvious Disconnect/Rage Quit instead of \"oh disconnect right before we lose to soften the LP blow\". Idk just seems like it could help allot when given crazy odds of even doing anything. Case and point a game I played earlier where 0/2 Renekton Rage Quit at 4 minutes, never saw from him again. Not really a game that was winnable.","replies":[{"poster":"Malhammers","date":"2016-02-05T18:46:09.267+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My girlfriend is pregnant and I hate her...lets talk about that disconnect.","replies":[]}]}
