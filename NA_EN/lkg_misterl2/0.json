But then randomly, about once per minute, I lose control of my character entirely for a second or two. It feels in general as though I was playing with 200+ ms, which I really dont think cause I dont have any massive lag issues in other games and my internet is good enough to support the game without a doubt. I am also using a cable (not wi-fi) so I doubt it is packet loss and also I am the only person using this internet access currently.\n\nIt is nearly unplayable when I just take a timeout in the middle of a teamfight for 1-2 seconds, sometimes even up to 5.\n\nI have looked carefully at the ping ingame and it has never gone up or down by more than 3 the entire game.\n\nAlso, with the \"press selected spell upon casting another one\" on AND off, if I (riven) press eqqw quickly and tell riven to move back just as the e finishes casting it still goes through the entire combo AND even does the W at the end, despite me spamclicking backwards, whereas it should stop after the first q.\n\nI've seen a thread on this with 6.1 and 6.2 but haven't seen any since.\n\nHelp? :3\n\nedit: This occured in the first game after patching today, but since I wasnt online for a couple weeks the patch may be a month old","replies":[{"poster":"LkG MisterL2","date":"2016-12-10T16:24:25.276+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"wow and now i have the same issue in other games... dafuq","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-13T16:18:11.763+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the update and information!
