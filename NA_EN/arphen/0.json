The second run I did, it increased to 147, and stayed there. Changed between Summoner's Rift and ARAM, but still the same thing. Forced repatch, disabled my firewall, closed my browser and game applications, and added LoL to my firewall exceptions (Windows Firewall btw). I have no clue what makes my ping skyrocket like that. I'd love to link my LoL Logs.zip, but I think it's against the rules of the forums or something?
