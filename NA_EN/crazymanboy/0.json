Here is the quick and dirty:\r\n\r\nMode Style- You pick your favorate champion, not being able to see who anyone else picks. You pop at the corner of the map all by yourself next to a store. With 800 gold you purchase what you need. 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, START. You rush to good fighting ground for your champ and try to kill the first person you see. The one with the most kills wins and is the Chamion of Champions!\r\n\r\nMap- Take the Crystal Scar map, double it in size, turn it into a large jungle with large open fields in the middle and where the turrets stood. Place 20 spawn points at the edge of the map. When someone dies, they will spawn at a random point that has a one way shield to protect the newly spawned champion. There they can purchase new items. They have a 5 second speed boost of 100% once they pass through the shield.\r\n\r\nI put down what I though was the most important, but please feel free to share what you think and what would make this a better mode.\r\n\r\nThanks for looking at my post.","replies":[{"poster":"BetaDude40","date":"2015-03-01T04:19:15.419+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"So this is more like a free-for-all deathmatch?\n\nI could see that.\n\nI imagine though that many people would just play FotM assassins or people with enough mobility to escape from being killed.\n\nI still like the idea though.","replies":[{"poster":"Crazymanboy","date":"2015-03-01T21:23:27.367+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"We could have a ban system where each player gets to choose one ban before the game starts.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Civil Dawn","date":"2015-03-02T01:48:40.911+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Sounds fun, but then players would just pick assassins or fighters or possibly mages.

This would allow **all** players to enjoy the mode, rather than favoriting assassins and fighters like in ascension, or like in aram, favoriting mages,adcs,& supports.\n\nIf League was to add any mode, Arena would be my favorite.

This would definitely not only be fun, but help people to learn how to hold their own.\n\nMy Ideas:\nPersonally, I think if they had this gamemode it would require everyone to be lvl 18, with all their skills unlocked. Because if someone fell behind, they'd more than likely have no way of catching up, thus leaving the game up to whoever got kills the quickest to dominate. \nMaybe even take away the use of Rune pages (just a thought, would make it fair across board, and make you rely on complete skill). \nI also think there could be a sub-version of this game mode. (Like how PvP has Draft, normal, TB). It could be \"elimination\". Meaning everyone would have a set amount of lives until they were moved to spectator. \nWith this game mode, I'd feel the winner should get a boosted amount of XP/IP from winning, as a little token prize for dominating the rest of the competition (lets say a flat rate of 400, or maybe 300). This would give more people an incentive to play, and actually feel good about winning.","replies":[{"poster":"Crazymanboy","date":"2015-03-01T21:45:18.909+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Some great ideas ActallyArrow! Yes just like a free-for-all. I was thinking about maybe a bonus for the top three players. 400 for first, 300 for second 200 for third and 100 for everyone else.

The nodes would be the only areas of the map not in the fog of war so if you try to take a node everyone can see you.
