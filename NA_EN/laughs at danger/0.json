If you check my match history, you can see that I've been level 30 for almost a year now, so idk why it's not showing that on this website. Also, I'm not sure if it's related or not, but for some reason, my Rammus + Shyvana item page I made on the old client but deleted is now showing up in the shop in the new client whenever I play those characters, only there's not supposed to be any item sets on the new client and now I can't delete it. If you could fix these things or tell me how that would be great. Your game is awesome otherwise and I'll probably keep playing it for awhile :)","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-29T03:22:33.658+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No worries! Sometimes your boards level can take a bit to sync up with your Summoner level (you're right, they are in fact the same). Once you posted here, it forced those levels to sync up with each other, and you're showing up as level 30 now!\n\nAs for your custom item sets, while you aren't able to make any new item sets your old ones will still show up. You can still delete that set though by going into C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config and either deleting the file named ItemSets or just deleting the entire Config folder. Deleting the folder itself WILL reset all of your client settings though, so be cautious if you take that route!","replies":[{"poster":"Laughs at Danger","date":"2017-04-29T18:19:39.611+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Laughs at Danger","date":"2017-04-28T23:10:21.014+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The game correctly says I'm level 30, but the boards say I'm level 3, not sure if I made that clear.","replies":[]}]}
