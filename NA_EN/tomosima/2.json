If Lee or Jax somehow really need unrestricted mobility, then their dashes should just be made free-targeted on their own, and if they don't, they shouldn't, but in either case that shouldn't have to rely on popping down a vision item and exploiting the game's old unit targeting system, which is clunky and especially opaque to newer players.","replies":[{"poster":"Spaceman5pff","date":"2017-02-16T21:52:06.227+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"The only issue with this is that Jax and Lee have the benefit of being able to not miss.\nYou click, you land there.\n\nBeing free targeted is different from being able to ward hop, since you CAN run out of wards if you are actually providing vision.\n\nThey are just slightly more restricted than they otherwise would be, is what i am getting at.","replies":[{"poster":"Teridax68","date":"2017-02-17T01:33:21.462+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's true, ward-hopping does carry slightly more of a cost, but even early on, that's not especially imposing when compared to the situations in which a ward-hop becomes critical to winning or surviving, e.g. a gank or an escape. Providing vision also isn't the main point of the ward-hop, which is part of why the mechanic isn't that great (you're using a purely non-combat item in the middle of combat for some completely unrelated purpose). If Lee or Jax are intended by the devs to have free-targeted mobility at a much higher cost, then it could still be possible to implement that with a separate cooldown, as with LeBlanc's global clone ult.\n\nMy personal opinion on this is that neither Lee nor Jax truly need free-targeted mobility: Jax needs a rework anyway, as he hasn't aged well and suffers from many classic skirmisher issues (he's one-note, and either steamrolls or fails to do anything useful depending on how fed he is); Lee depends on his ward-hopping for his Insec kick, which has become iconic on him, but already has access to such a wealth of tools, and has such a high skill floor, that he really shouldn't be able to perfectly dictate the pace of fights, on top of having more options than anyone else in the middle of combat, nor does he need yet another \"high skill mechanic\" when simply trying to memorize all of his abilities for the first time can be challenging. Really, the only reason he hasn't lost that ability, which Riot themselves had tried to enact a while back, is because his fanbase has grown so attached to every part of his kit that removing any component will always feel like pulling teeth.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Harut","date":"2017-02-16T21:51:45.865+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This x1000","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"NvestmentPlanker","date":"2017-02-16T10:57:09.219+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":34,"body":"So all the champions that have dashes and blinks put in their kits to get out of the dumb decisions they make is ok?
