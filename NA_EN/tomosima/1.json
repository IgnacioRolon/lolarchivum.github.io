The either imo failed to capture the previous champ properly, resulting in a maybe great new champ but therefor a pure loss regardeing the old one, or they failed to actually change anything meaningfull, resulting in exactly the same issues that basically caused the rework so the rework was basically pointless, or story and art fail for me...The only reworks i'm really happy with are  Sion and Anivia so far, and the once that i'm failry happy with are Poppy, WW and Brand","replies":[{"poster":"Parceval","date":"2017-02-25T21:39:14.772+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"His story update was so lame.

I miss healing allies and murdering the hell out of people with the carefully planed use of... Shields (R + E twice). Tbh she was pretty cool like she was and only need to change her W. Today? She's pretty much either OP on organized play, or a burden on solo play because of her horrendous decay late game (Pretty much near useless If you don't get enough AP to one shot of half-shot people away with R + Q), although her numbers are actually pretty high.\n\nI also kinda miss {{champion:37}}  before her rework on patch 4.13 - although I remember distinctly about people bitching all day If i ever picked her on ranked. (You could Q so many times before people get bored, I guess.) DJ Sona didn't even exist back on those days soo... it isn't like I could complain too much, lol. At least she actually has a skill curve and You can distinguish good ones from really, really bad ones. The only thing I hate from her kit today is the Rank 1 Heal - 35 healing for 80 mana, weee. Kinda offset by the shield. She also seems to still not be used very much on LCS.\n\n{{champion:44}} too... I dislike his ult at the moment. It's made pretty much for organized play and requires WAY too much timing, and I think it needs to be tweaked or changed to something else (Because, oh, you ult and the enemy team so easily runs away until it wears off). At least he no longer is a \"ball of stats\", but Shatter and Radiance were thematically cool. And OP, kinda. I used to go top with him xD. These days before, at least his Q actually healed something, rather than being dispersed over five allies.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Daktao","date":"2017-02-26T03:02:42.479+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:107}}  for sure.
