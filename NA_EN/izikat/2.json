So I check my internet everything was fine. I disable my firewall and I restart League. Then it tells me if I have to repair my client soo I let it repair it self. While its repairing I'm using my phone then League crashes. Keeps happening I tried taking the easy route by uninstalling LoL and reinstall it * note I install League on a usb drive since my computer is like 10 gb of free space I know right I'm poor* for some reason every time I trying installing Lol the drive goes corrupt and suspends and disconnects it self from the computer. So I googled a solution to the disconnection problem and it worked but the only thing that makes my usb automatically disconnect is LoL installer. I tried installing photoshop on it and it worked perfectly fine.\r\n\r\nhere is some logs from event viewer \r\n\r\n\r\nLog Name:      Application\r\nSource:        Application Error\r\nDate:          12/7/2017 9:32:40 PM\r\nEvent ID:      1000\r\nTask Category: (100)\r\nLevel:         Error\r\nKeywords:      Classic\r\nUser:          N/A\r\nComputer:      JASIELWIN\r\nDescription:\r\nFaulting application name: LeagueClientUx.exe, version: 0.0.0.0, time stamp: 0x5a0b8b92\r\nFaulting module name: libcef.dll, version: 0.0.0.0, time stamp: 0x58a39fbe\r\nException code: 0xc0000006\r\nFault offset: 0x00576bd0\r\nFaulting process id: 0x13dc\r\nFaulting application start time: 0x01d36fcc05fb4bda\r\nFaulting application path: E:\\LoL\\RADS\\projects\\league_client\\releases\\installer\\deploy\\LeagueClientUx.exe\r\nFaulting module path: E:\\LoL\\RADS\\projects\\league_client\\releases\\installer\\deploy\\libcef.dll\r\nReport Id: 5098338e-0810-4429-8dfd-e07ed65798ed\r\nFaulting package full name: \r\nFaulting package-relative application ID: \r\n\r\nFaulting application name: LeagueClient.exe, version: 0.0.0.0, time stamp: 0x5a0b8b9b\r\nFaulting module name: rcp-be-patcher.dll, version: 0.0.0.0, time stamp: 0x5a060001\r\nException code: 0xc0000006\r\nFault offset: 0x000fca60\r\nFaulting process id: 0x110c\r\nFaulting application start time: 0x01d36fcc04f1422a\r\nFaulting application path: E:\\LoL\\RADS\\projects\\league_client\\releases\\installer\\deploy\\LeagueClient.exe\r\nFaulting module path: E:\\LoL\\RADS\\projects\\league_client\\releases\\installer\\deploy\\Plugins\\rcp-be-patcher\\rcp-be-patcher.dll\r\nReport Id: 92ccd521-d200-4d30-9a28-26b12e359662\r\nFaulting package full name: \r\nFaulting package-relative application ID: \r\n\r\nWindows cannot access the file  for one of the following reasons: there is a problem with the network connection, the disk that the file is stored on, or the storage drivers installed on this computer; or the disk is missing.

Open the file again. This situation might be a temporary problem that corrects itself when the program runs again.\r\n2. If the file still cannot be accessed and\r\n\t- It is on the network, your network administrator should verify that there is not a problem with the network and that the server can be contacted.\r\n\t- It is on a removable disk, for example, a floppy disk or CD-ROM, verify that the disk is fully inserted into the computer.\r\n3. Check and repair the file system by running CHKDSK. To run CHKDSK, click Start, click Run, type CMD, and then click OK. At the command prompt, type CHKDSK /F, and then press ENTER.\r\n4. If the problem persists, restore the file from a backup copy.\r\n5. Determine whether other files on the same disk can be opened. If not, the disk might be damaged. If it is a hard disk, contact your administrator or computer hardware vendor for further assistance.\r\n\r\nAdditional Data\r\nError value: C000000E\r\nDisk type: 0\r\n\r\n\r\nI know some people are gonna tell me to run Chkdsk but ive already ran it still doesn't work.
