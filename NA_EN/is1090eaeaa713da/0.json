It seems the button in the client may not be flipping the setting off in the game's files. You should be able to resolve this by either swapping over to the *Legacy Client* (from the login screen) and disabling it there before swapping back over to the new Client. If that doesn't work, I recommend taking the steps below:\n\n>**1.** Launch League and Log in then minimize the client\n**2.** Navigate to the Config Folder **(C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config)** and open the LCUAccountPreferences.yaml file with Notepad any other text editor\n**3.** Find the line that says \"**chatFilterDisabled: false**\" and change it to **\"chatFilterDisabled: true\"**\n**4.** Save the changes you made to this file in your text editor, then close League and relog.\n**5.** Your chat filter should show as disabled after checking your settings (cog in top-right of the client) under your *Chat &amp; Friends* section.\n\nLet me know if this helped!","replies":[{"poster":"IS1090eaeaa713da","date":"2017-01-17T05:17:20.817+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Under there it already says true.
