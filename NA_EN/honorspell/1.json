They still have a place on the team (and you really *should* have a tank on your team every game) but there's just too many champions that were indirectly buffed or just buffed with the new items introduced in the preseason.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TehNACHO","date":"2015-12-12T18:48:46.648+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Darius and Illaoi are Fighters (subclass Juggernauts), yes, but Poppy is pretty in line for a legitimate tank.\n\nFurthermore, flat Health is a defensive stat often associated for Fighters, whereas resistances are a defensive stat associated best with Tanks. It's why its more common to see Health based Fighers and Health based Fighter items compared to more tried and true Tanks and Tank based items focusing on resistances. For example, notice how the three items you listed only give health. Notice that those items are most associated with primarily Fighers.\n\nThis also means that Tanks are actually (somewhat) better well off against HP damage, since their focus should be on mitigating it, not having the Health pool as a buffer like Fighters have to rely on.\n\nFurthermore, %Armor Pen is mathematically weaker than it has ever been before except for, say, against a full armor opponent. If we're going to be complaining about resistances, that should be pointing at the Black Cleaver meta or at least before Season 5. Complaining now about that is silly.\n\nAnd as for items countering damage, both {{item:3211}} upgrades heavily mitigate AP Burst. {{item:3105}} upgrades counter AP AOE effects. Finally, the three MR Swords {{item:3156}} {{item:3139}} {{item:3091}} all come with unique niches for even offensively focused champions to counter AP Damage. To ignore those effects is dumb.\n\n\"But Nacho? All those are MR items? What about Armor Items?\"\n\nWell for a start, let's not ignore {{item:3143}}. But here's the thing, AD damage is supposed to counter tanks. Well, not really, actually it's specifically DPS damage that's designed to counter tanks, but since the majority of AD Champions delay their damage or spread it out over time, whereas AP Damage tends to almost always be upfront burst, you should be able to see why there's less Armor to counter ADs. It's because ADs are supposed to counter Armor, not the other way around.\n\nYou have some points but at best they're not relevant to the gamestate as it is today (especially the comment about Armor Pen, for example). Stop complaining, and especially don't give a reason for Juggernauts to only need to rush one defensive item and be suitably tanks for the remainder of the game.","replies":[{"poster":"honorspell","date":"2015-12-12T19:34:26.766+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"those are actually pretty good points, and makes me rethink parts of my complaint.\n\nfirstly, i have always been a fan of the rock paper scissors of tank>burst>sustainedDPS>tank, so i understand that aspect.\n\nsecondly, im opposed to juggernauts needing only one defence item, and my main problem with the items i listed at the beginning (especially {{item:3053}} ) is the fact that it lets them moderately boost damage and health at the same time, for immense total value. it seems like they are tankier than tanks at times.\n\nthird, {{champion:78}} , i just watched a game where one built {{item:3071}}  and {{item:3053}}  and was pretty much one of the juggernauts, but i agree poppy is quite able to be an actual tank, so yeah she doesn't belong on that first list.\n\nfourth, your comment on tanks being mostly resistance based makes sense, but is also feels kind of odd due to the nature of {{item:1409}}. could you possibly link a jungle tank guide of some form? (not doubting you, mostly looking for help with my tank game)\n\nfifth I UTTERLY FORGOT {{item:3143}}, thank you for reminding me.\n\nsixth, and feel free to just ignore this one, what do you think of the item idea?\n\nagain, thank you for your input, it was certainly valuable.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sire Hippington","date":"2015-12-12T20:19:30.629+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Tanks aren't weak, it's just that they mostly excel in coordinated teamfights mid-late, but aren't as powerfull in lane.\nRight now, the game is pretty chaotic, many skirmishes and snowballing in lane kinda became imperative, hence champions that dominate lane and are good in skirmishes are favoured over teamfight/mid-late champs.\nGiven the enviroment, tanks perform quite well right now.","replies":[]}]}
