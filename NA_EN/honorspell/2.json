Lets do a rundown:\r\n\r\nPassive: nerfed. doing magic damage instead of attack damage means that he is no longer hybrid damage. they only need to build MR.\r\n\r\nQ: nerfed. can be interrupted by rolling into a sorakka silence. There is no force on earth that CANT stop him now, he has gone from terrifying force of nature to easily brushed off.\r\n\r\nW: NERFED. oh dear god no. the movement slow is so bad. I can&#039;t do much without it, and with it people just walk away from me like its nothing.\r\n\r\nE: nerfed. Specifically the attackspeed vs armor shred. one of my favorite things about old taunt was that it helped the rest of the team even more. Our ADC could shred people with this armor shred. I could taunt tanks and make them die so much faster. Now the taunt only helps him. That is not the selfless playstyle I need from my rolly polly tank.\r\n\r\nR: buffed. Less damage, but gives AOE CC? This is what i wanted more of. sure its just slow, but it can be used to help the team.\r\n\r\nRammus had 2 things really going for him, his wrecking ball entrances, and the fact that he was {{item:3075}} incarnate.\r\n\r\nNo more wrecking ball, now he&#039;s more of a cottonball, set off course by a slight breeze. and sure he still bounces damage, at the cost of being IGNORABLE.\r\n\r\nEvery one of these changes (except the R, it can stay) has made rammus both less powerful and less enjoyable, this coming from a now ex-rammus main.\r\n\r\nIs this just another person whining about changes to their favorite champ: Yes, but it feels good to whine about it.","replies":[{"poster":"Meep Man","date":"2017-06-13T16:51:13.707+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":2,"body":"And yet his win rate didn't budge at all.

Check his pick rate on op.gg and you will answer your own question. Besides that, whether he is less powerful or not, COMPLETELY less enjoyable can translate into less powerful if we can't even do the things that we used to do, ie the type of ganks that we could do before, the turret dives, etc etc. I think you need to do some critical thinking.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"raynac","date":"2017-06-13T17:51:05.264+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The worst thing is the self slow, I could deal with everything else if he didn't apply a self slowing effect to himself.\n\nHow is he supposed to effectively apply cc when he's slower than unmounted kled running from battle","replies":[]},{"poster":"ForgiveColour","date":"2017-06-13T16:49:14.440+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"How does it feel to have your new main perma banned","replies":[{"poster":"honorspell","date":"2017-06-13T19:20:45.813+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I have no idea why people are downvoting this.

He no longer feels like a tank, but some kind of roaming support.  He's not good for initiating team fights or soaking  damage now.  His damage is even lower, but his damage was never the reason I picked him. I picked because he was super tanky and he gets tanky earlier than most other tanks do.   Rammus use to be able to suffice as a team's only tanky.  Now Rammus cannot tank. There is no reason to play Rammus over Amumu, Sejuani, or Zac now.","replies":[]}]}
