It's usually caused by a network problem that can't download items or assets so you end up with a black screen instead.  Start off with our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) article to help rule our possibilities towards a fix.
