However, I tried a few games of ADC recently and personally felt like I did better and I had more fun doing it. Now I&#039;m torn because while I love being that solo laner who can tank and split push to win, I also love being the damage dealer and being in the middle of fights. And although I feel like I do better playing ADC, the people I generally play with say I do just as well if not better top. Although with the new ranked system it is easier to play multiple roles, should I think about switching my main role and just focus on climbing ADC? Should I stay top? Or should I try to split my time evenly with each role and learn both?","replies":[{"poster":"ZaneShadow","date":"2019-01-30T23:27:20.141+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, you do have a main and off position in ranked. \n\nProbably experiment more. Donâ€™t give up a position too easily, since you might just be interested in the newness of adc.","replies":[]},{"poster":"solopolo3","date":"2019-01-30T22:54:57.130+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since you're already good in top lane, you should probably stick with that. As good as it may feel to play bot at first, it's the hardest lane to climb with. You can play top lane carries though. Champs like jax, riven, camille, akali, yasuo can all carry teamfights. Some hyper carries are also played top i.e. vayne, cassio, karthus, viktor etc.","replies":[]}]}
