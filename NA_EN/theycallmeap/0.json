His lane phase is tougv and he has mana issues early but his ultimate is always intimidating to the enemy team and he can decide the outcome of teamfights with a well timed ultimate alone. {{champion:36}} Is another really strong champion he can heal himself very well while dealing more dmg than an average tank. A piece of advice use w only when you need it so you dont lose too much health early. grivious wounds hurt him but overall a meat shield you should fear.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Galaxyburstz","date":"2019-02-16T21:51:00.912+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"S Tier List for this Patch:\n\n{{champion:43}} {{champion:17}} {{champion:26}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:85}} {{champion:112}} {{champion:37}} {{champion:117}} {{champion:61}} {{champion:8}} \n\nTake {{item:3303}} ---> {{item:3311}} ---> {{item:3312}} \n\nRun Kleptomancy rune, poke lane, take 0 farm until item quest is complete, win game, thank me later...\n\n: )","replies":[]}]}
