I just can't seem to do it consistently. Some games I will focus more on farming than trades and will be even at 10 minutes and then all of a sudden I get destroyed by the enemy champion and I can't farm anymore. Other games I'll be behind by 20-30 CS at 10 minutes but manage to get a few kills and then get ahead after that. How can I both be able to harass and farm evenly so I don't have to worry about being behind early game or late game?","replies":[{"poster":"Kalikain","date":"2019-04-21T21:16:20.038+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Auto the melee minions once each.

Also that means if your opponent doesnt auto the minions, you get the exp first. It gives you the level 2/3/6 trade advantage if you level up first.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Minimac2000","date":"2019-04-22T15:25:41.438+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Uhhh, anotherfeeder has it right about farming under tower. You also have to recognize that some champs (mages especially) have really really crappy auto attacks and don't cs well until they have large mana pools and can clear with their spells. Specifically {{champion:45}} and {{champion:34}} have some of the slowest weakest autos in the game and vs something like {{champion:157}} {{champion:238}} their wave clear is so safe and perfect that you will probably get outfarmed early every time even if you are costing well. Just don't worry about it and keep scaling. Also practice tool cs up to 10 minutes 10 times a week trying to improve it and you'll improve. My CSing to be fair is still awful but as a former support main it used to be a lot worse","replies":[]},{"poster":"AnotherFeeder","date":"2019-04-22T02:43:41.041+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its most just practice with the champs to know how much dmg their abilities will do. When farming under turr most champs will need to auto caster minions one time before tower shot so the next auto will kill it. Melees r two tower shots one auto. If u want u can always go into a practice tool and practice csing in a lower stress environment.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Galaxyburstz","date":"2019-04-21T23:38:12.367+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://www.google.com/amp/s/m.wikihow.com/Be-a-Farmer%3famp=1\n\nThis might help, thank me later","replies":[]}]}
