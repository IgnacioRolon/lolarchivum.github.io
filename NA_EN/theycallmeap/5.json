The fact that there are multiple classes balanced around solo lanes has nothing to do with marksmen. \n\nIf it was really about that kind of parity in what classes can play what roles, ADCs would actually need to be tuned to compete in solo lanes, and I'm pretty sure you don't want that.","replies":[{"poster":"Fízz v2","date":"2019-02-06T10:35:20.302+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">ADCs have been mostly neither for a while now.\n\nWhat about {{champion:236}} {{champion:81}} {{champion:145}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:498}}  and even {{champion:15}} {{champion:429}} \n\nIll admit that some non-marksmen are played over other adcs like Tristana or Ashe so maybe they are weak, but when was the last time there werent ~5 adcs that are absolutely broken?

And if you ask me, it still does most games now. Mid and jungle are the roles that can impact bot lane the easiest, and there is a reason why mid laners roam bot over top at least 90% of the time.\n\nAs for adcs, maybe you are right and many of them arent too good anymore. But that doesnt change the fact that Riot keeps insta buffing adcs once they arent at the top (I mean they still are but.. u know, not all of them). \n\nDo they care about assassins literally being less viable mid lane than tanks and bruisers in high elo?

I can't tell.\n\nADC as a role has not been strong for some time. The impact that Bot Lane had on the game was greatly diminished since 8.11, and games were much more about mid/jungle carrying games then it was about getting the ADC fed and winning through them. Is that starting to shift? Maybe, we'll see. \n\nADCS have not been required since AP damage to turrets and ADC base stats were changed. Which is why bot bruisers like Irelia and Yasuo were a thing for a while, and bot mages like Heimerdinger, Karthus, Veigar  and Cassiopeia are viable if not strong to this day.\n\nAs for the ADCS that survived or were strong, solid picks during this time that you mentioned... what about them? Of that list, the only ones you could make a case for being broken are Lucian, maybe Ezreal, and a few months ago Kaisa. Are you claiming a class isn't weak as a whole because 2 of the champs in that class are good? That's not a very high standard to reach.\n\nAlso consider that for the brusiers/mages that could go bot, duo lane isn't even their optimal position. Meaning these champs in their second or even third preferred position were better than most of the ADC class in their sole viable position. \n\nIf you recognize that, I'm not sure what you're arguing here.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Kaìju","date":"2019-02-05T15:21:14.420+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot literally enforced it by taking the meta developed years ago and saying \"yes this is how the game should be.\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sir Saltarin","date":"2019-02-05T15:15:32.264+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"OtterlyLost","date":"2019-02-05T15:11:16.474+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I've already been enjoying the role more with more of the damage nerfed.
