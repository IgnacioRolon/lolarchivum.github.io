I feel like if I learn how to cs effectively and be able to cause lane pressure I could help my team out much more and obviously be a much better player. The issue is I don&#039;t really know how to do it. Any tips?","replies":[{"poster":"Illabethe","date":"2019-01-28T03:04:54.046+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It depends on the champion.\n\nUsually, top lane auto attacks minions or uses some direct target abilities to clear, and uses aoe/gap closes to harass.\n\nBut, others use Aoe to clear and use auto attacks and direct target to harass. \n\nit really depends on the champ.\n\nBut I can give you a couple potent examples:\n\n1) {{champion:420}} The goal of this lane is to hit E's, and pull the champion's soul between your wall tentacles, and a minion wave. If you do this, You can target the Spirit, and the tentacle will hit both the spirit PLUS the minions, killing a wave and damaging the champ.\n\n2) {{champion:122}} Generally farms using his W, which is a low cooldown attack steroid. Single target. He sometimes will use Q to farm, but usually it's a followup for using his E to pull.","replies":[]}]}
