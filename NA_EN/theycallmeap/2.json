I know he is extremely broken late game and can 2-3 hit squishies once he gets his stacks, but it seems like the laning phase is a lot of just sitting under tower and Q last hitting. He also doesn&#039;t seem like he brings much to teamfights and is easily kited. I&#039;ve never actually seen a Nasus carry and even a fed Nasus can be countered once his ult is down. So is he really worth it? Seems to me like his early game and mid game are very weak and although he turns into a monster late game he also doesn&#039;t seem to have much carry potential and seems like he is easily countered until that late phase.\nI probably answered my own question in there somewhere to be honest but I need someone to lay it out and outline it for me","replies":[{"poster":"L9 GarthBrooks","date":"2019-02-03T16:17:40.584+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nasus takes at least 2k games of practice before u want to put him in rank. He's highly mechanical, position is imperative at all times, and very unforgiving to tiny errors. You're better off learning a simpler and easier champ like fiora or riven. Leave champs like teemo garen trynd nasus wukong etc to pro players","replies":[]},{"poster":"ValyrianBlade","date":"2019-02-03T15:52:47.011+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nasus is probably better the lower elo you are.\n\nAs teams don't work together as well, you can wither the ADC and just walk up and kill them. A lot of bruisers will just stand in front of you and you can kill them too. Low elo players also won't get sufficient jungle help to shut you down in lane, yet you can call for ganks when the enemy is pushed in and you have good gank assist with wither. You also can build Righteous Glory to give you MS to run on top of them and avoid being kited anyways.\n\nThat all being said, Nasus is much better as a situation pick instead of a default main pick. Enemy team lacks good peel? Nasus is a decent pick. Your team has great disengage to let you split and farm stacks? Nasus is a decent pick. Your team has great lockdown to let you get to your desired target? Also a decent pick. \n\nOn the contrary: enemy team has solid cc, your team lacks engage/disengage: Nasus is probably a pretty bad pick.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nhifu","date":"2019-02-03T15:29:05.746+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd say pick up Jax, they will never nerf that guy.\n\n{{champion:85}} is also a good pickup if you're solo queuing. Since most noobs don't all-in unless they are trying to killsteal you in lower ranks.","replies":[]}]}
