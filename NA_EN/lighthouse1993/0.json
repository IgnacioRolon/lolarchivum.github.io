TICKET #31797810","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","embed":{"description":"Imgur: The most awesome images on the Internet.","url":"https://imgur.com/a/isJPZ","image":"https://i.imgur.com/6YihGyl.jpg?fb"},"up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"To the LoL community or anyone whom it may concern, \r\n\r\ni'm a player from the garena region and often purchase merchandise from https://sg.merch.riotgames.com/en/. I've issues in regards to my final boss veigar figure to be delivered to singapore which has gone missing for 2 months now. I've sent many tickets regarding the issue and I've also emailed inforiotgames and privacyriotgames. Garena customer care is of no help. I figured I create a Europe account to check on my ticket status and also because the ticket status service isn't catered to the Garena Region. \r\n\r\nThe tracking information provided in the confirmation email is incorrect but after being redirected endlessly by customer service, the right tracking link was finally provided: https://webtrack.dhlglobalmail.com/?trackingnumber=GM295321776000028527+ \r\n\r\nI then enquired as to why is this so. The support team apologised saying \"I can't really give you a straight answer but once it ships out we don't have a way to track it other than the tracking the courier gives.\" on September 25th 2017. Since then I've contacted DHL in which they also apologised saying \"Delivery time delays can be due to weather incidents, customs or backlogs. In your case, please contact your shipper or online shop to discuss options.\"\r\n\r\nI then commented on my ticket saying \"Shipper tells me to contact DHL and DHL tells me to contact the shipper.\" I am caught up in a ping pong match between the 2, notwithstanding the earlier hassle trying to find the appropriate avenue for relief. I even suggested if I could be directed to a person higher up from the LoL team or get another Final Boss veigar delivered to me. Of course a monetary refund for a limited edition veigar i promptly ordered is not ideal for me so I did not mention it. \r\n\r\nThese comments have been submitted by me between 26th September and 10th October 2017. It is now October 17th and I haven't receive a reply, an acknowledgement, or even other options available. A whole 21 days and not to mention the confirmation email was sent on 22nd August 2017 - a solid 2 month problem. \r\n\r\nEssentially, I have been playing the game since season 1 and I own every figure and unlocked statues from Riot Merch. For me to be treated this way feels like betrayal aside from the tremendous frustration.  Now I risk the damage of losing out on a limited edition figure.  \r\n\r\nThe negligence from providing the wrong tracking info and the lack of adequate customer care prompted me to launch a DHL global investigation as to the whereabouts of my parcel which takes up to 2 to 3 weeks. I am left with no communication from Riot games or redress until the investigation is complete. \r\n I just needed to vent my frustration to the community. I have never had an issue with Riot Games Merchandise before and I love the game very much but Is this appropriate? Has anyone experienced this before? Is this the quality of customer service intended by Riot Games? \r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nAaron","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-17T17:44:46.065+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there!

I tried to order from the OCE merch shop but it still got charged to the US merch shop. I didn't get a confirmation email, no tracking number, the only thing that is showing on the status is \"complete\" as the status which i hope means that it is still coming and even though very thorough with my address saying Australia on it, hasn't been delivered to somewhere else. (for reference it has now been 1 and a half weeks but no detail into the shipment at all just hoping its still coming cause i know normally from the US it should take roughly 2 weeks to ship even despite ordering over the OCE and being directed again onto the US service.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"lighthouse1993","date":"2017-10-19T15:49:18.917+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you Rioteer.
