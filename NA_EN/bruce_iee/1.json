Take for example say when samsung galaxy skins come out and you open them is there chance you can get those?\r\n\r\nOr once you bought them they are already randomized and selected for you based on the skins you bought the capsules/boxes that day?\r\n\r\nHope this wasn't too confusing :/","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-09T02:10:31.623+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Those chests and capsules don't have their contents changed or decided based on what you bought that day.
