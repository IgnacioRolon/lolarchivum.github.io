I’m Riot Greenily, a UX designer working on League of Legends. I’ve worked on things such as Nexus Blitz, the new stat panel, the stat runes, and more. I wanted to share a small, but highly visible, update to the game experience that will be on PBE today and ship during the 9.13 patch. \n\nWe're changing the appearance of the damage text you see when dealing physical, magic, and true damage, as well as their crit styles. You can see how they will look below:\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/h0E22xl.gif\nPhysical Damage and Crits\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/VotgZBF.gif\nMagic Damage and Crits\n\n\n**Here are our goals with the changes:**\n\n1. **CONSISTENCY**\nWe’ve changed the damage text color in order to shift towards consistency throughout the League experience. Damage and crit text has been standardized from four colors into three unique colors. This means you should be able to tell at a glance what type of damage is being done, even if it’s a crit. The crit icon has also been updated to match the style you see in the stats panel.\nAs we work on future in-game updates, we want to make sure our system of stats and colors makes sense. The colors of physical and magic damage text should now feel more related to AD and AP stat colors respectively. \n\n2. **READABILITY**\nWe also want to hit clarity and readability of the damage text. This iteration of colors should make damage type differentiation more clear. If you commonly pay attention to damage text, we hope this helps you. If you don’t, this shouldn’t affect your experience negatively.\n\n3. **SATISFACTION**\nWe’re testing some changes to the animation style of crit texts to make the initial hit really pop and seem impactful. With the change of both color and animations, we hope crits will feel more satisfying.\n\n**In terms of feedback:**\nWe'd love if you could share your feedback with us—especially after you've played with this change for a few days. Even if you don't normally pay attention to combat text, the changes could feel a little jarring, but we hope it's positive overall. \n\nWith that in mind, please give us your thoughts on the readability of the text specifically. Eg: Does the color of the text get lost to you in game? If you’re colorblind, do you feel that this is an improvement from the old text colors?\n\nThanks for your patience as we go forth with this change. Your feedback is appreciated in making the game better!","replies":[{"poster":"Nico di Angelo","date":"2019-06-18T17:39:08.271+0000","up_votes":26,"down_votes":0,"body":"I honestly think using the same colours for mana expenditure and magic damage goes against the second goal.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Greenily","date":"2019-06-18T21:59:14.973+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":5,"body":"The colors are in the same blue family, but are not the same. Once the color reaches the game space, the differentiation between hues becomes minimal (on that I agree!), especially when the damage is a DoT (as it gets lighter over time). However, we do also use more than one channel of communication for damage texts seen above.\n\nThey can be any combination of:\n1. Color\n2. Scaling (text size)\n3. Positioning (on me, on them, etc.)\n4. Additional visuals (icons, health/resource bars, etc.)\n5. Animation\n6. Text\n\nWe're working under the assumption that mana expenditure using different positioning, scaling, animation and visuals (HUD + resource bar on health bar, prepended \" - \" sign) from magic damage text will allow you to distinguish between each one in-game still. After playing a few games with these changes, let me know if you still feel like you can't tell the difference between the two texts.

I think of all the things you listed the most clear way to contrast things is by color.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Greenily","date":"2019-06-19T21:34:25.258+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":4,"body":"Hi there! When we examine future UI and visuals updates in the game for the future, faster related system updates that we want to keep consistent with future work (such as colors) will often preempt major system updates. As a result, the preceding changes won't seem to make as much sense _yet_ since there isn't a holistic context to back it up with.\n\nSO, to give you all the full context, there is nothing wrong with purple--we are preparing purple to consistently represent **magic resist** / **penetration ** and the blue family to represent AP / magic damage, with mana being a darker blue. You can see this color logic represented in the stats panel currently on live, and with some items (Adaptive Helm, Abyssal Mask, etc) although not all things yet (we know!). In contrast, warm tones such as red and orange are saved for the physical damage / AD stats and greens for health and heal/shield. Setting this color system up ahead of time allows us to better plan for consistency with UI and tooltip work in the future.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/R6iYeCW\n\nThe reality is that we have many important stats and text types that we want to be sure have appropriate colors tied to each one. We also want to make sure that color readability and appropriate contrasts can survive on multiple surfaces (against in-game colors, on tooltips, as icons, as text). Nothing is exactly set in stone, but we'd like players to give it time and test it out.

The two reasons I worry about the new changes are because:\n\ncolors: the old colors are very vibrant and the sharp gradient really adds to the intensity of the crit and the new ones just seem to be lacking in that department. it actually makes it harder to distinct between a crit and a normal attack when i look at the video because the colors between a normal attack and a crit are so similar. \n\nanimation: The current crit animation feels really good because it is like a normal damage text but it has a little accent so it feels like a critical strike. the main concern for me with the new one is that the text stays for a bit and then bounces off which doesnt feel like a strong attack in comparison to it just bouncing off instantly but more intensely. for example if you throw  a rock at something really hard vs throwing it mildly hard, throwing it really hard would have it bounce off super fast and intensely while throwing it mildly will still have it bounce off just not as hard. \n\noverall I'm just kinda questioning why these changes are happening in the first place because I actually really like what we have right now and I don't see any complaints and I think everyone currently loves the feel of a crit. but that's just what I think and I kinda think these changes are a bit under the radar right now so I would recommend having some people, particularly adc players, test them out some more. \n\nalso about the toggle thing: I think it would be really cool actually if there were a lot more customizability options in league specifically pertaining to things like this because it really is quite subjective. for example someone mentioned the red hp bar damage maybe that could be something with an option.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"L Rayquaza","date":"2019-06-18T20:25:36.963+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm gonna guess from lack of note about it True Damage is going to stay white?","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Greenily","date":"2019-06-18T20:38:07.711+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, true damage will stay white.

We did actually test a form of the gradated blue crit (and FWIW it did look pretty cool). Here's the reasoning behind why we're staying away from that:\n\nCRIT is a stat that increases your chances of dealing an extra big damage number with your auto-attacks. The reason why the crit icon is gradated is to show that the damage type is **physical**, but it is a subset of physical damage that is **affected by the crit stat** you see in the panel (this is where the reddish tint comes from).\n\nTechnically, there is no equivalent stat for magical damage. Magical \"crits\" in-game are used to make certain skills more satisfying (LeBlanc popping Q, Anivia doing double damage, Ryze Q, etc.) And so what we really want to be able to do is have a _separate icon_ entirely (not crit icon!) for those skills that feel extra good when you proc a hit or meet the special conditions. We will explore making this feel visually satisfying at that point in time. For now, blue crit icon is the flat blue because it is not otherwise affected by any particular stat.\n\nTL;DR In the future we will be exploring how to represent special magical damage without abusing the crit icon and styling!\n\nHope this helps explain!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Azanoz","date":"2019-06-27T00:25:15.450+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can I get an option to change it?","replies":[]},{"poster":"DMT Sarevok","date":"2019-06-19T10:04:40.567+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The reality is that this game needs a deep detail of customization just like Overwatch and other games, let us choose in the options colors for everything (mana, health, hp bars, combat dmg text and so on).\nI have a very rare form of colorblindness and i almost can't see differences between enemy and ally minions...\nI'm available to be a test case for this and future development in matters of colors.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Greenily","date":"2019-06-19T22:06:00.997+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"Hey there!
