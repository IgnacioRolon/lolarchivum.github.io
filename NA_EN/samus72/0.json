With the gold they do have, they often buy items that provide further utility to their team, like Sightstone or Aegis of the Legion, to free up their teammates to build more damage/tanky items.\n\nA lot of different types of supports can succeed from hard engage/all-in supports like Leona to more conventional (in terms of rpg background) healer supports like Soraka.\n\nMiss Fortune is not a great pick for the support role, since most of her kit is focused around dealing damage that scales up with items.

It's obviously not ideal, but her passive gives her free mobility boots to get around quickly and ward/gank, and her old W gave her good damage early to make up for not having items, with E doing a fine job at preventing champions from getting away and allowing your adc to run if necessary.

Speaking as a long time LoL player I've seen the trends come and go. First off, while I'm not defending the meta lane assignment against all possibilities, it is something that was built up over time and has been reinforced as a core strategy.\n\nSee, originally, LoL didn't have these rigid lane assignments. You had 2 top, 1 mid, 2 bot. Or you had a jungler, sometimes, but not always. This was because Junglers didn't have special items to make their clears faster, they only had 1 smite at a time, they didn't have fancy smite effects.. all in all, they tended to be behind the curve in terms of gold. If you had a jungler, Mid & Top would be anywhere from 1-3 ahead of everyone, the 2 Bots would be about the same level and the Jungler would be somewhere in the middle. So you didn't always have a jungler.\n\nHowever over time patterns began to emerge. Because bot lane shared XP (and often gold, since again there wasn't a set \"Support\" role), they were usually a bit behind the rest of the team. So the more you could isolate players the more XP they'd get, they'd be stronger and outscale their opponents. This is why a 1v2 top lane might win if their Champion scaled really well or if they had a kit that let them hold their own while outnumbered (Old Mordekaiser and Dodge Jax were my two favorite 1v2 to planers).\n\nSo eventually junglers became more and more common to give their tops the edge - or at least, avoid being behind because they were sharing XP. The jungler struggled in terms of items until late game, so Junglers were typically based on their ganking potential - Warwick's Ultimate made him one of the original Terror junglers once he hit 6, where Amumu might pose an even greater threat early on because of his long-range 1. Also, these Champions typically didn't need a ton of itemization; they had strong abilities (either their base damage was pretty high, or their abilities themselves had strong effects to help them jungle, such as CC for ganking or Healing to sustain in the jungle).\n\nThis mentality eventually made its way to bot lane, too. If you gave the ADC all of the minion kills (CS) to give them more gold, they'd be able to destroy a lane with 2 people who were sharing the gold. Early game, one big item is better than 2 small items.\n\nFast forward 5 years or so.. and now we have a unique set of Jungler & Support items that cater to their roles. Because of this the diversity of these roles have definitely increased. However, at its core, the Support Champion still does the same thing. This is how I personally define it:\n\n**The Support should help the ADC win the lane**\n\nNow there are a lot of different ways to win. Soraka wins the lane by giving her ADC more health, keeping them healthy and letting them win trades over and over until they push out the other person, or just kill them. Blitz wins the lane because his hook is a very strong ability, essentially letting him turn the fight into a 1v2 very briefly. He pulls the ADC away from their teammate and behind the minion line, which puts them in a very bad spot - especially if they already have the upper hand. He's also great at stopping them from retreating. He's the \"I'll hold 'im, you punch!\" support. However other Champions have started making an appearance; Morgana's *long* range snare lets her catch the enemy out of position, and Annie has a regular stun that can be targeted or AoE, in addition to high base damage.\n\nBraum is the kind of Tanky support that is good at keeping at teammate alive (since his shield can block all projectiles, which can completely shut down someone like Jinx), whereas Leona is the kind of Tanky support that is good at starting a fight.\n\nThe common denominator between these Champions usually comes down to their base abilities. Generally, a Support needs to be able to do well with a limited amount of gold, especially if their lane doesn't get any early kills. Even though they have gold generation items these still won't compare to the CS gold from another lane. So maybe they have oodles of CC in their abilities, or they have shields & heals to keep their teammate alive. These all work, and they don't require having items to deal damage, they just use the \"effects\" of their abilities.\n\nSo what about \"Kill Lanes\" - where you take another DPSer or someone who deals damage in lane? Well, sure. If it helps them win the lane, those can help. Since \"traditional\" supports tend not to deal a lot of damage, a damage-based Support can sometimes tilt the lane by pushing both of the laners off the XP line and starve them. However these lanes will typically fall off if they don't get those early kills, and the lack of items will be a problem in the mid game until the 'support' has time to farm.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2015-11-25T09:23:25.847+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think you're limiting the definition of \"support\" to maybe CC and heal/shielding.\n\nThe short of it is that the support is there to prevent the carries from dying, and help them get kills. Getting in the way of damage or attracting the enemy focus (tanking) is a way to support, and securing high value targets or peeling enemies off your carry is supporting too (like Blitzcrank).\n\nIf you're stuck supporting with a non-traditional support champion (like Ashe), you want to keep doing the same thing as much as your kit allows; control as much vision on the map with wards/sweeper as you can, and harass the enemy so they are forced to leave or are an easier kill for your carry.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Samus72","date":"2015-11-26T06:38:49.238+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good information.

But I'm not going to back down from choosing Nami and healing everyone just because some tank managed to type \"support\" before I could click on Nami's portrait.  The only time I would back down is if there are already two characters in that can heal.  A team with three healers could work but the odds are often against it (it would be rare to find three healers that actually work together.)\n\nNow, I don't know how it works in ranked (I've yet to play ranked,) but I've already been told that refusing to yield to someone who calls out a certain position / role will get you reported by players and banned by Riot (I don't believe that last part.)

It means two things.\n\n1)  Support champion - a champion focuses solely on supporting their team as a whole.  These champs will have low damage but some of the highest utility in the game.  These are champs like Soraka, Sona, Nami, and Thresh.  Their power lies largely by enabling their teammates (shields, heals, and peels).Not to be confused with Tank champions, who tend to disable enemies (disorientation and initiation).\n\nThe two types of champions are closely related, as they both demand follow up by teammates with actual damage to win the game - just instead of utility they generally get free tankiness and better initiation prowess.  Both types of champions will pretty much have CC, though it will normally be slightly nuanced to fit the respective role.  Think Nami bubble or Sona ult in comparison to Nautilus hook or Sejuani ult.  Nami's bubble and Sona's ult can be, and frequently are, used for initiations (this is not a bad thing).\n\nHowever, these abilities are much better for peeling - as when the bubble hits an ally they get a speed boost and enemies are CC'd (so when a fighter inevitably dives your carry you can both speed up your carry to run away faster and CC the enemy).  And obviously it goes without saying that Sona pretty much needs Flash in order to initiate and it's way easier to hit a team coming at you straight on than one trying to keep their distance.\n\nNow Nautilus hooks can be used to peel easily, however it arguably more ideal to use it to catch an enemy out of position (disorientation + initiation).  Same with Sejuani's ult, which is optimally used when the enemy team is bundled up in one neat spot (which hopefully does not mean they're all inside your back line tearing apart your squishies).\n\nHowever at the end of the day, utility is utility and is generally just plain useful in most situations.  This is why it's common to see Tank champions bottom lane as well.  It's also important to remember that a lot of champions aren't pure in the fact that they will exhibit certain traits from other types of champions (hence the secondary tag Riot put on nearly everyone).\n\n2)  Support position - the meta-game roll referring to a player who plays a champion bot lane in order to assist the meta-game carry in lane.  _**This is purely meta-game**_.  This is a term players use that does not strictly exist in game.  Any champ can be played in the support role, just like any champ can be sent to any lane - but as always you're going to have varying degrees of effectiveness with what champion is picked.  Way back in season 1, ADCs went mid solo and bottom lane was just a duo lane of any two champions (and I kid you not, even Amumu and Soraka laned together - IN A PRO MATCH).  There was no \"support bot\", it was just \"duo bot\".\n\nThen the playerbase got smarter and realized that gold doesn't affect the utility baked into any champion's kit, so it was more efficient to have a high utility oriented champ to be in the duo lane to assist champions that were much more reliant on gold.  It didn't matter if Blitz had 300 gold or 30k, any hook he lands on you is likely to end in disaster for you.  Marksmen then filled the \"carry\" role due to the nature of their kits; high sustained damage that was heavily reliant on gold to achieve and required teamwork to fully utilize.  Since Support champions specialize in enabling (the carry to take risks and deal damage) and Tank champions in disabling (the opponents from retaliating and making them vulnerable for the carry to attack), the natural synergy lead to the bottom lane meta that has dominated the strategy in League of Legends for a vast majority of the game's lifetime to the point where the term \"Support\" is synonymous with any champion that has an abundance of utility that can help a Marksman succeed in lane.\n\nTL;DR:  Support champions are not the same as the Support role in bottom lane, which is solely a product of the meta game and optimization.","replies":[]},{"poster":"EcchiOtakuTM","date":"2015-11-26T04:59:36.015+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Supports are either \"Utility, Tank(Disengage), or damage\" Supports\n\nUtility are stuff like healers/buffers such as lulu/sona/soraka/janna/taric\n\nTank/Disengage are stuff like taric/tahm/naut/blitz/thresh\n\nDamage are mages and alot of off-meta supports, There's more that I can write later on","replies":[]},{"poster":"Samus72","date":"2015-11-26T03:32:32.636+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't believe warding should fall to only one or two people.  EVERYONE can carry a ward of some kind.  If you have one and are not using it, you do yourself, and your team, a disservice.  Even Riot seems to stress that warding is very important.  If you get jumped from behind, that's not anyone's fault but your own.  Tunnel vision is deadly.\n\nMy idea of support may be \"unconventional\" to the game, but that is how I play.  If I choose Nami or Soraka, I'm healing.  If I am out there trying to DPS, I'm deluding myself and screwing over my team because neither Nami nor Soraka were designed to be damage dealers.  Even Soraka's lore backs that up!\n\nAnother thing I dislike is this rigid lane assignment people feel is mandatory.  You might start out at mid lane, but you won't stay there forever.  \"Top lane is solo only.\"  Who says?  I've seen plenty of solo laners feed a double team and quickly have their outer turrets destroyed.  Just today, I played a game and went to back up a middle lane guy.  The other person there told me to \"Get out.\"  Two minutes later, the middle lane was double teamed and my dismisser was clicking for help.  Talk about hypocritical.  Yes, I eventually did go back to the middle lane to help.  But not before typing out \"Karma sucks, doesn't it, bub?\"\n\nYes, my play style is \"outside the box.\"  But it works.  When I'm healing and you tell me to get lost, blame yourself when you die and I could have healed you through it.  You TOLD me to leave.\n\nOk, rant over.  I just think players should be a bit more specific when they say they want the \"support\" role.  Helping someone in their lane may technically be support.

Both are very common things. The only thing that's unusual about you is your rigid belief that only healers are real supports. Consider the following: if you're in bot lane and there's a healer on one side and a poke champion on the other. The latter's poke will be largely countered by the heal.\n\nThat's fine, but now switch things up.  Let's say you have heal on one side and burst damage on the other. Now things are different. Healing in League is a low-impact affair, where each instance of healing is small, but adds up with subsequent casts. Burst, on the other hand, is supposed to kill you as quickly and with as few rotations as possible. If one side is support Annie and one side is Soraka, all Annie has to do is wait until the opposing AD carry gets out of position. Boom: flash+Tibbers. One ability rotation and the Carry is at 40% health. But wait, that also comes with a stun, so Annie's carry closes the gap and attacks during that stun. Soraka's carry takes damage too quickly to heal through it.\n\nThe same result may not hold true if the support is someone tanky or even a poke mage. The former can effectively bodyblock and peel for their carry while the latter can poke often enough to keep their health low and thus make an engagement very dangerous.\n\nIt is not a case of Healing Ueber Alles.\n\nAlso, let me teach you why different roles go where they do, because it's not just blind refusal to break from conformity.\n\nMaps based on the original Defense of the Ancients have 3 lanes and spaces between. Each lane has enough gold and XP for one champion. That leaves 2 out. One of can go into the jungle, but that leaves another without a steady source of income. Solution? Place them with the Carry, the player who starts off the weakest and that needs to be allowed to grow into a late game powerhouse. Now, if you're going to have 2 people in one lane, you have three choices.\n\nTop lane used to be bereft of any meaningful early-game objectives, to placing the pair there serves little purpose. Mid lane can reach Dragon, yes, but another issue arises there. Mid is the shortest lane, and therefore the safest. If you put the ADC and support there, you relegate your other fragile champion, you mage/assassin/what have you to one of the long lanes (top/bot), and that's not so great. Moreover, they have good roaming potential, unlike the carry, and can contribute greatly towards objective control and ganking.\n\nFinally, bot lane. Close to that is dragon, which now gives a stacking buff that can give a team a significant advantage on the level of Baron, if they kill it enough. And, as I mentioned before, it's a long lane. Unsafe, yes, but that is mitigated by the presence of the support, thereby leaving Mid lane to the other squishy bastard, while top and Jg work things out for themselves.\n\nTop became an island because it had no close objective, mid was given to the other squishy guy, and the pair is put in bot lane so that they can help take dragon.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Samus72","date":"2015-11-26T03:42:05.283+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Didn't say it did, sir.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Samus72","date":"2015-11-25T20:07:14.014+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's...weird.\n\nIt's been my gaming experience that DPS characters (and you can call them \"adc\" here if you want.

What they lack in heals, buffs and shields for allies, they compensate with their CC who can be used both to feed the ADC in lane and keep him alive via peeling later on.\n\nSupport champions (sometimes called \"traditional supports\"): {{champion:12}} {{champion:432}} {{champion:53}} {{champion:201}} {{champion:40}} {{champion:89}} {{champion:117}} {{champion:267}} {{champion:37}} {{champion:16}} {{champion:44}} {{champion:412}} {{champion:223}} \n\nCan be, are currently or have been used in the support role although originally designed for another role: {{champion:1}} {{champion:22}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:9}} {{champion:3}} {{champion:79}} {{champion:59}} {{champion:43}} {{champion:99}} {{champion:57}} {{champion:54}} {{champion:25}} {{champion:111}} {{champion:76}} {{champion:20}} {{champion:80}} {{champion:98}} {{champion:161}} {{champion:45}} {{champion:106}} {{champion:26}} {{champion:143}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"alfavhunter","date":"2015-11-26T03:09:00.446+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For some people the support role is the ward dispensing Btch of the team who is always to blaim for everything\n\nThose people typically lose their support early in the game and the \"support\" supports another lane and gets them fed \n\nYou \"can\" support with any champion, doesn't mean it will work well\n\nBut as a support main it can be fun to change it up and do an unconventional support now and then\n\nI've supported ap shack before\n\nCome late game I split push all game with boxes everywhere and force their team to send someone at me even though I have 70% less gold than who they send at me\n\nLaning as ap shaco support is putting boxes down so your adc can be safe to farm, poke with shiv and generally survive laning, but late game you split push all day just to make the enemy rage but you have to play smart about it, and getting banner of command for it is a must","replies":[]},{"poster":"Samus72","date":"2015-11-26T01:14:21.798+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What is \"CSing?\"","replies":[{"poster":"IronwallJackson","date":"2015-11-26T01:21:00.237+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"CSing is what we call in when you're in lane farming minions for their gold and XP, more specifically,  getting the last hit and kill on them so that you actually get those resources.","replies":[{"poster":"Samus72","date":"2015-11-26T01:31:30.356+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=IronwallJackson,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=k4iEOITe,comment-id=00080000,timestamp=2015-11-26T01:21:00.237+0000)\n>\n> CSing is what we call in when you're in lane farming minions for their gold and XP, more specifically,  getting the last hit and kill on them so that you actually get those resources.\n\nFair enough.  But getting the last hit when you're not alone in the lane has been communicated to me as \"KS\" aka Kill Stealing and is bad.  I've read some guides who say to ignore those that cry foul on that because kills benefit the team (the whole team gets gold,) and not just one person.  But it doesn't stop people from cussing you out for it.\n\nBluePolarizer, I think RPG because that is my gaming background.  I can help the team without being in a \"support\" role which is what I'd call a healer or buff giving player.  I question the usage of the term \"support\" in the way it is used in LoL.  A center fielder may be supporting his team by catching fly balls.  But that's his job.  The medic or massage therapist supports the team with medical aid and relieving muscle soreness.  That is their job.","replies":[{"poster":"IronwallJackson","date":"2015-11-26T01:59:06.340+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll try to address things point by point, so bear with me.\n\nThe issue of whether or not you're stealing a kill gets muddy when there are multiple combatants in play, such as when the assassin and AD Carry gang up on someone. However, if you're the Jungler coming in for a gank, ideally, you should be trying to give the kill to someone else, preferably the person who's lane you ganked. Similarly, the support should be trying to feed their Carry instead of getting kills for themselves.\n\nThe reason for this is that both Junglers and Supports are made to be viable on low gold and experience. They perform a similar role in the game, which is helping the other, more fed team mates, succeed (mind you, Jungler's most important role is to maintain map control and to secure objectives).The Support does this because the ADC scales very well with gold and they themselves usually do not. The team, as a whole, benefits more from a fed Carry than a fed Support, because the ADC is the one that can reliably kill tanks in the late game and take towers. The Jungler is pretty much in the same boat, though there are \"carry Junglers\" that can snowball and carry the team on their backs.\n\nNow onto the issue of kill gold. Those who get the kill get full gold and XP. Those who participate get partial gold and xp. Those who do nothing get nothing. The exception to this is a recent change to how shutdown gold works. I forget the exact details, but the gist of it is that now the whole team gets at least a portion of the gold bonus from killing someone on a streak.\n\nFinally, \"supports.\" It's a loose term here, and so long as you're performing the duties of a support, you count as one. Now, whether you get flamed for your choice of support depends on whether you and the champion you picked can do your job well.\n\nA good example of a \"nontraditional support\" is Brand{{champion:63}} . He provides damage and CC. That's it. His base damage values on his abilities are high enough, however, to deal decent amounts of it even with just a few items. Does he protect the carry well? Not as much as others can, but his damage and stun can do a lot to secure kills for the carry.\n\nYou know, a thought comes to mind. The cleanest way to describe what a support does is \"help the rest of your team win.\" That's it, really. As long as you can get others to win the game for you, either by applying well-timed crowd-control, soaking up otherwise lethal damage, healing, or buffing, nothing else matters.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Sir Yamazuki","date":"2015-11-26T01:37:49.002+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Support is used as a label for both position/lane and champion type.

Lulu, for instance, is strong on her own but makes a versatile support. Sona, however, loses a bit of her power solo and is more useful as a team member than a solo mage, and has some of the greatest teamwide utility if she's within aura range of her entire team, but falls short when there's less.

Even the supports you list as being \"real supports\" like Lux and Sona are evidence that LoL supports are not just about keeping health bars high.

Damaging enemies so they're quicker to kill/leave your friends alone = supportive.\nW - heals and shields allies. Sustain + damage blocking = supportive.\nE - speeds up allies. team mobility = supportive.\nR - stuns enemies. Engage + disengage are supportive.\n\nAs you can see, Sona supports her team in a variety of ways, despite being only a single champion.
