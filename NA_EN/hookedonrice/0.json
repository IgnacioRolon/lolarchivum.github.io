However, whenever I play Malzahar, I always have to select the Snow Day skin in order to use it because the base skin is automatically selected instead, despite using the Snow Day skin in the last game.\r\n\r\nMy question is if this is a bug, because none of my other champions seem to have this problem. Or is there something I have to click in order for the Snow Day skin to be selected automatically after locking in? It gets annoying sometimes since I&#039;ll occasionally forget to re-select Snow Day and end up using the base skin.\r\n\r\nOn another note, the Voidling-Poro in Snow Day Malzahar&#039;s recall animation seems to be bugged as it just appears as a solid blue color over the model instead of the intended textures","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-02-09T17:26:41.734+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Morning HookedOnRice! \n\nThanks for the report! \n\nWe're aware of an issue where previously used skins aren't sticking in champion select and defaulting to the base.\n\nWe're also working on a fix for Snow Day Malzahar - it appears there's a missing texture here.","replies":[{"poster":"Eapenator","date":"2016-02-09T18:53:16.990+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't know if this helps but the skin you last used in blind pick seems to be the skin that is automatically chosen in the new draft mode. \n\nFor example, you pick TPA shen normal blind pick, then after that game, you go to Normal draft pick, choose shen, it will automatically select TPA shen.
