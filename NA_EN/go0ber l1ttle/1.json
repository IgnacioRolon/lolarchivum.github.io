Every time I open the game, I get a bugsplat error. The thing is, nothing is wrong as far as I can tell and the game continues to run smoothly. I was wondering if anyone else was having this problem and perhaps if it&#039;s on my end or something with the client itself.","replies":[{"poster":"purgatoryzero","date":"2017-03-06T17:31:45.373+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Similar issue here -- would be good to know from Riot what is going on here, esp if it is a virus.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MURDEROUS1","date":"2017-03-06T02:37:06.939+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i have had the same issue and have been shutting down my comp instead of clicking on the bugsplat message.
