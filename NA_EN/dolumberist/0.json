I joined the game in the beta and i played since then, i loved the game and i wanted to give riot the most support i can so i like to buy skins since beta, i almost spent 1500€ in the period of 9 years, i like the design on the skins so i allways buy the ones for my main characters (wich are almost all champs in the game) I never used the lootbox system just because i want to choose what i buy and what i dont.\r\n in the last year i cant barely play because of the family and the work, so i just play normal games for fun when i got a bit of time.\r\n\r\nToday i was playing jungle wich is one of the most conflictive positions because you have to interact with all players in the game, so you got more chances to get discussions and this happened. There was a vayne jungle O.o against me playing shaco, she decided to invade my first red and blue, they killed me and i got a bit mad. I going to share the chatlogs riot sent me with my perma ban report: (linked to the post)\r\n\r\nFinally we manage to win the game by roaming and playing as a team, and thats the end of the story. I admit I over flamed and said not nice things but this seems pretty unfair to me:\r\n> Because a player-triggered review found your in-game comms extremely inflammatory and offensive, your account’s been permanently suspended.\r\nYou are among 0.006% of League players negative enough to be permanently suspended.\r\nOther players have judged your comms to be far below the standard of the League community. The vast majority of players agree that while League’s an intense, competitive game, all players deserve respect on the Rift.\r\n\r\nIts been a long trip with league of legends and you all guys, the same way sometimes we get tilted other time we share awesome experiences playing the game, because we are all humans and we can make mistakes sometimes, but it seems like riot just dont want guys like me in the game, even i supported since the first game, even before when we play w3 dota, supporting all the youtube videos, participating in the community, in tournaments, following youtubers and streamers and spending basicaly my whole youth with them. I think that suspending permanently an account is stealing all of that time invested, like 20k hours and 1500€ just to see how for a kid tantrum you lost everything. \r\n\r\nWell thank you for reading this, i hope you all guys have fun playing this awesome game, its been a nice trip.\r\n\r\nI will try to use a recurse to get back my acc but guess the riot policy is stay inamovible in his decisions so guess it wont be so well.\r\n\r\nI will update the post when i recive news for those who wants to know.\r\n\r\n**My best wishes\r\n**\r\nZanek!","replies":[{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2019-01-11T19:37:15.869+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":">but this seems pretty unfair to me:\n\nMay I ask why?

Riot has a lot of data that shows that adding additional punishments doesn't lead to a meaningful increase in behavioral changes, and the whole point of the punishment system is to give players a chance to reform their behavior. Once you indicate that you are *not* willing to find other outlets for this sort of frustration, I think a ban is appropriate.","replies":[{"poster":"DolUmBerIst","date":"2019-01-11T20:14:49.508+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"I dont agree with that, i will never give up on a person even if he is wrong if we promote this kind of punishment it will lead us to live in an authoritary society imperating the fear to the rules.

It's not really equivalent of a criminal sentence though, because it's magnitudes less. It's closer to getting banned from a coffee shop or a restaurant after repeatedly abusing other patrons. They gave you several chances, and you demonstrated that those chances did not result in a change in behavior. At some point the company needs to care about the cost to their properly behaved customers, and that may mean banning you from the real/virtual premises.","replies":[{"poster":"DolUmBerIst","date":"2019-01-11T20:30:13.065+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":6,"body":"At some point they allwais unban you.

I can understand even a permanent chat ban or ban from ranked chat but not even being able to log in and use Practice Tool or play vs bots is ridiculous. The only time I can see a permanent ban as justified is if someone's cheating or griefing in terms of gameplay and intentionally trying to lose. If it's just chat, you could just disable that person's ability to use chat. Most people communicate through pings anyway.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"insomniacjezz","date":"2019-01-11T20:49:01.740+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Account sharing is against the terms of service, so if you did give it to your son it could be banned.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vlada Cut","date":"2019-01-14T11:19:08.883+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=DolUmBerIst,realm=EUW,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=P8iyvHsX,comment-id=000200000000000000000000,timestamp=2019-01-11T20:30:13.065+0000)\n>\n> At some point they allwais unban you.

Youre not a bully. Youre not beyond redemption. There were rules and punishments set in place, and you ignored them. This is the consequence that is clearly stated in the rules.
