No matter if I play on EU West or North America or anywhere I constantly have lag spikes. I've tried restarting my router and my computer numerous times in the game and out of the game. Sometimes it stays constant but sometimes it makes the game unplayable. I use wireless and will switch to ethernet once I can get a dongle, but for now is there anything I can do that can help me? I've already lost many many games because of this issue.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-16T01:47:16.838+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It could be that your network has some odd routing issues, where your connection is having a really hard time getting to our servers reliably. If you could, run a traceroute for about 5-10 min to the NA servers at  104.160.131.1 so that I can get an image of what your connection is looking like on it's way to our servers.","replies":[]}]}
