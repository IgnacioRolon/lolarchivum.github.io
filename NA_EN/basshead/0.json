Which suprises me because I think i'm on a decent laptop.\n\n\nMacBook Air (Mid 2013)\nMac OS El Captian 10.11.4\nProcessor 1.5GHz Intel Core i5 \n4GB RAM 1600 MHZ\nIntel HD Graphics 500 1536 MB\n\nI haven't noticed this problem before.... Also sidenote : this even happens when league is the ONLY program running. It feels like League + the new client is a cpu hog and the new client takes up much more mb of ram (about 800-1100mb) than the legacy (about 600 mb).\n\nCan anybody shed light on what it means to be using over 100% cpu?\n\nP.S. These \"cpu drops\" tend to happen inconveniently of course when a team fight or couple of ultimates erupt.\nP.S.S. Yes i'm using the lowest possible settings in the game ","replies":[{"poster":"Positioning King","date":"2016-11-30T19:39:14.749+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can't help with League of Legends, but I will drop some mad knowledge:\n\nThese days pretty much every CPU has 2+ cores (dual core, quad core, etc). Each core *basically* acts like its own CPU. The CPU usage listed in the resource monitor tracks usage across all cores. So if League alone is using say 60% of one core and 65% of another core, you'd end up with a listed CPU usage of 125%.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-30T19:30:14.154+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The updated client is still in testing, and this is a great report to help the client devs with mac testing.
