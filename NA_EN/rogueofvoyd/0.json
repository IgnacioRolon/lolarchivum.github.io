Turns out the update took about 3 hours and seemed to be bigger then I thought. I opened League client and signed in as normal went to load into a game and on the loading screen my game freezes. At this point I am not able to ctrl+alt+del, tab out or windows key out. My only option at that point is to hold down the power button for a reset. I have tried updating my drivers with the GeForce launcher and also directly from the GeForce website with the newest update that came out today and still am not able to load into game. \r\nI have an HP Envy x360 laptop if that helps at all. Anyone have any ideas of things I can try?","replies":[{"poster":"Kareem100","date":"2016-09-26T20:50:40.134+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM PLZ HELP US!","replies":[]},{"poster":"God 0f War","date":"2016-09-22T05:05:33.898+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had the same problem with you right now after update window.
