I had to play through the chat restriction, then had to change my ways and improve my self to get out of locked honor, and now if I want to play Clash I will have to wait a quarter of a season. \r\n\r\nFor those who don&#039;t know if you receive any sort of ban your honor drops to level 0 and if you receive a chat restriction, you will be set at honor level 1. Clash, however, is locked at level 2 and seems almost unreachable to any of these players. One suggestion I have is to lower the Clash honor level to 1 in order to warn people that if they keep being toxic enough they will get a ban and it will be unplayable while still having room for players who lost it once to better themselves. If Riot insists Clash will be locked at level 2 it shouldn&#039;t take most of the season for me to play it because of a chat restriction. Maybe boosting how quickly you get honor checkpoints at the lowers levels would be an improvement while scaling honor for later ranks (keeping honor level 3 and higher difficulty as it is right now). After all, it has been proven that reward is much more effective than punishment; knowing that you can be honor level 2 and unlock Clash in about a month would be a lot more appealing to toxic players than making them sit back and watch everyone else have fun for the length of a season and could improve their in-game behavior.\r\n\r\nAlso, I understand that it was my fault for being toxic but I have friends who are genuinely positive but one day decides to flame a game because they are super stressed and now it will take them up to a whole season just to play Clash.","replies":[{"poster":"Communist Toast","date":"2018-04-11T00:04:32.233+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I actually think it's pretty nice.\nbefore honor really meant nothing, sure you get some lame ward at the end of the season, but that's nothing imo.\n\nnow there is a reason to care about honor (a little anyway, I mean you start out at honor 3 anyway)","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-04-10T23:57:06.492+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"It takes more than one game to get a chat restriction unless someone intentionally and knowingly did something extremely unacceptable.\n\nDont play on tilt, dont expect the system to give infinite second chances and free passes.","replies":[{"poster":"Duskdragon2000","date":"2018-04-11T00:44:20.420+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I've been chat restricted twice in 3 years and both times it was because of 1 maybe 2 games of toxicity.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"RobtheFrog","date":"2018-04-11T00:20:16.762+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I got banned 2 months ago.

This length of time you go without seeing any progress for your efforts of trying to be positive can instill learned helplessness in players and veer them from progressing into being toxic.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Secrios","date":"2018-11-13T18:44:58.632+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its an unjust paradigm that must be abolished.

I don't see any connection to cultural elitism, could you elaborate on that? How exactly is it an \"unjust\" paradigm- specifically what's unjust about it?\n\nAlso 6 months later? You don't have to answer that one, I just found it humoring.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"The Bad Touch","date":"2018-05-25T12:17:49.212+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Cynikul,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=7E4l7lKx,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-04-10T23:56:47.763+0000)\n>\n> That would reward bad behavior though?
