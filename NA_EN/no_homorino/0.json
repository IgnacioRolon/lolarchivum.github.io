I kept my cool, but these guys were like mad or something. I did feed, went 0-10 but was just so tilted from the chat and losing streak. Will they get punished for toxicity or does it need multiple reports for riot to do anything? I'm fairly new to the game, just started to play ranked and this community seems a bit toxic.","replies":[{"poster":"HarambeMeme","date":"2017-06-22T04:52:07.591+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":8,"body":"your playing league of legends thee most toxic game","replies":[{"poster":"no homorino","date":"2017-06-22T04:54:32.704+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Will they get punished though?

I guess their logic is that feeding causes verbal abuse, so you deserve it. However, poverty could also cause crime. Though most people blame crime, they all try their best to get rid of poor area. That's the fact of most countries in the world.
