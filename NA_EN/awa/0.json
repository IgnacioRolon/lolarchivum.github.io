Recently, however, i have thought of an idea that if added would show kindred's lore perfectly to players and also improve their viability in game.\n\nMy idea is for kindred's **E** (Mounting dread) to have an additional on hit passive, making it so that if at any point the crippled enemy becomes untargetable, the damage that would be given by the **E** instantly activates, disregarding the usually needed 3 attacks. The animation and description for her **E** is meant to symbolise how if you try to run from Lamb, the Wolf hunts you down and kills you without mercy. \n\n> Wolf hunts down those who run from their end, delivering violent finality within his crushing jaws.\n\nI strongly believe that this change would improve the character in multiple ways, not only would this change be a slight buff to Kindred, but it would also give Kindred an interesting niche that is true to their character. Wolf hunts down those who try to run from death, so anyone trying to escape Kindred's eternal hunt would have to think carefully about denying Lamb's arrow, because that might just provoke Wolf.\n\n> If you refuse her, Wolf will join you for his merry hunt, where every chase runs to its brutal end.","replies":[{"poster":"BlackKnightJack","date":"2019-08-29T09:52:13.810+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not totally sure that's a good idea considering Kindred's ult grants enemies invulerability.","replies":[{"poster":"AwA","date":"2019-08-29T10:38:49.979+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"True, it untargetable would be better, and since you mention it, it would actually make more sense for this passive to activate on untargetable opponents.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"PandaNator43","date":"2019-08-29T18:44:02.506+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Coo idea!\n\nThings I like:\nI agree it fits the theme really well. And would definitely give them a niche, and could help emphasize wolf (wolf is more of an after though). \n\nConcerns: Its a little bit of a [False-Choice](http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=293417). But only a little bit. There are probably still plenty of times to activate {{item:3157}} even when it would proc the damage. Its a pain to have to check what effects can be {{item:3140}}'d. I don't want to start doing that with {{item:3157}} too. \n\nAnother way to do it would be like Illaoi vessel thing, where if they run to far way then it activates... but that has the same concerns.","replies":[{"poster":"AwA","date":"2019-08-30T09:57:05.846+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree completely, there are several ways that i think the general idea of a wolf's punishment to be added, and I understand that my idea might not be the best. In reference to the False choice thing, i would think of it as a bit more of a punishment, for example, you can dodge this amount of cc, but you will instead have to take the damage of Kindred's **E**. With response to the Illaoi reference, it could definitely be done that way, however i feel it doesn't represent the metaphorical side of running from death as much.","replies":[]}]}]}
