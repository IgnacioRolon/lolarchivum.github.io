My PC was not turned on since sometime last year, so I wan't affected by the virus at all. However, ever since I did update Windows, I cannot seem to launch the League Client. \r\n\r\nWhen I press the \"Launch\" button from the Launcher, everything \"League\" stops then and there(evidenced by the open Task Manager process list). When I try to launch the \"LeagueClient\" straight from the program list, I just get the \"This app can't run on your PC. To find a version for your PC, check with the software publisher.\" message.\r\n\r\n A lot of people seem to have an XBOX-app-related solution, but I do not see that coming into play anywhere for my situation. When I go to the \"Compatibility tab\" in the \"Properties\" for League of Legends, there is not a selectable compatibility mode for Windows 10; the most recent is Windows 8. I've tried re-installing to no avail, and popular user-suggested \"fixes,\" such as running as Administrator and deleting the \"lol_patcher\" and \"lol_launcher\" folders prior to opening the shortcut, but nothing has worked. \r\n\r\nIf there is an obvious thing that I am missing, I would love to eat my shoes and be told the simple solution. I want to play your game, Riot; please help me do so.","replies":[{"poster":"Phlounder","date":"2018-01-24T23:43:40.809+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same issue here...","replies":[]},{"poster":"J3lessed","date":"2017-09-28T12:16:25.523+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am having the same issue, if there is any solution please let me know.","replies":[]},{"poster":"x TUI","date":"2017-09-20T11:50:58.433+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi, I've got the exact same issue.
