You have previously posted that \"She will be released at some point during patch 4.18. Unfortunately, I don't know which day. :c\". I'm starting to lose faith in this comment. Patch 4.19 is sure to come soon, and what is going on with Reaper Soraka? I feel like waiting for patch 4.19 so they can release all of the harrowing skins at the same time is a thing Riot would do. I've been waiting for Ravenborn Leblanc for so long starting to lose hype :c.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2014-10-21T16:23:49.904+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"My previous statement still stands - LeBlanc's skin, as well as Wukong's skin will be released in patch 4.18.","replies":[{"poster":"FatedTitan","date":"2014-10-21T17:00:47.107+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> My previous statement still stands - LeBlanc's skin, as well as Wukong's skin will be released in patch 4.18.\n\n\n\nSo my question is this then.  Reaper Soraka will be in Patch 4.19.  Will all of the Harrowing skins not be released at the same time?  Or am I an idiot and we're actually on 4.17 :p","replies":[{"poster":"ULTRAF0RCE","date":"2014-10-21T19:38:38.304+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"we are on patch 4.18 but  as far as I know there have not been any changes on pbe other than new splashes and some season 5 prep stuff so this very well might be the last patch before the next preseason or it might come out next week and the leblanc and wukong skins will be released this week","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MrBuffington","date":"2014-10-21T17:06:58.336+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This makes me happy that they'll be released soon but sad that 4.19 isn't coming too soon :P","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Fried Noob","date":"2014-10-21T01:24:59.295+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"It'll probably be released sometime this week, seeing as how halloween is next week.","replies":[]},{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2014-10-24T15:28:33.220+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Underworld Wukong and Ravenborn LeBlanc are now available. :3","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dragonslayer RB","date":"2014-10-22T16:04:21.855+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I heard from a pumpkin master those two skins will be released this Friday and Reaper Soraka in the next week.
