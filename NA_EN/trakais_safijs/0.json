I died a couple of times and started flaming. The best part is that the flame wasn`t aimed towards anyone but **myself**, i just had to burst out a bit to let myself cool down a bit. Afterwards I was talking with** my friends** and talking shit with **them** and not _TOWARDS ANYONE._\n\n\nIs there any chance that &quot;cool&quot; rito will un-ban my acc? I actually _don`t even believe_ that, just curious if there is even a chance.\n\n\n\nPS. Even if something was aimed at the enemy team, they had no way of reading it, since i was writing only in team-chat.

At this point, Riot is  handing out bans like candy to anyone they don't like, and trusting the other players to be fair. They're not. Trolls issue reports too, you know. Do you trust the trolls to be honest? \n\nAnd 'derailing the game'? Riot doesn't watch the games. At best someone looks at a one sided chat log. Give me a break.

They want to be the word police but won't actually outline rules. They want to be able to ban whoever they want for whatever reason. I am getting very sick of the communism in this game. Not to mention the CHEAT math. Items don't give what they're labeled to, in terms of stats, and I don't think it's an accident at this point.\n\nI think Riot is cheating us across the board, possibly even giving 'honorably' players phantom buffs and penalized players phantom nerfs. The math literally doesn't add up in game, and their death reports are almost always wrong...yet they don't fix it. Like some sick joke against those of us who can actually run the math through our heads.","replies":[{"poster":"MrFawknSunshine","date":"2018-11-29T19:03:25.161+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"seriously stfu\n\nyou have no clue what you are talking about","replies":[{"poster":"Paul 024","date":"2018-11-29T19:05:52.431+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"Uh oh.
