Sounds interesting!\n\nIt is technically required in the rules however it is not unknown for cooperative players to be able to pull off using in game pings as their primary form of communication.  These situations vary by team however players who are unable to communicate may be removed from said team as per our rules.  It is required to have an operational microphone to join the community.","replies":[{"poster":"RavenDaze","date":"2014-12-16T05:04:51.529+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Ah, okay.
