It's ABSOLUTE BULLSHIT.   I see so many good threads get downvoted, I see so many good posts get downvoted and all it is is gatekeeping.  It's fucking gatekeeping.  Almost every post I see with a downvote or two has zero replies, no one is willing to argue their point or make a counter point; and keep good ideas from being discussed.\r\n\r\nThere will never be growth or innovation as long as the innovative are stifled by the mediocrity of the majority, conventional minds of conventional men undermining the community under the pretense of popular rule and majority consensus.  It's disgusting.  This community is disgusting.  Reddit is disgusting and copying Reddit is disgusting.","replies":[]}
