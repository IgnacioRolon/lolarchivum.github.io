This will be probably onother post considered as &#039;&#039;QQ post&#039;&#039; , but as player who have been playing this game for long time I want to share my opinion about the condition of the game.\nSo I want to start with couple of reasons and I will answer them at the same time.\n\n**1.The game is changing.**\n_For good or for bad the game is changing into something more attractive and also more enjoyable.Many patches are out and keep comming , some changes are good , some of them are bad we are just the ones who will taste the harvest._\n\n**2.Champion and item changes**\n_I know Riot keep the game fresh and exciting , but what have you accomplished so far ? In my opinion nothing and you will accomplish nothing by making something stronger even more stronger or nerfing something that is already nerfed.I got the feeling that Riot move according to their inner voice - Hey , lets mess things up.\nBoom , next patch 7-8 champions nerfed , same number goes for buffed champions,some items are reworked to be more efficient and some of them are buried to the ground.You can&#039;t achieve balance by making something stronger or weaker than already  is._\n\n**3. Player behaviour **\n_Blah , I hate to talk about this , but it is so fking unfair ! How can you be matched with someone who have no will to keep playing after couple of deaths.How can you give up so fast , play-this is why you came here in the first place aren&#039;t you ? You die so what ? Keep playing ! Getting flamed ? Ignore them ! Loosing lane ? We are team , we can fix it if you got the will to keep moving forward.\nYou are not helping you and your team if you give up , if you are in mood to play don&#039;t ever press the Start button.\nFlamers are everywhere in all online games , but in League they are factor , trust me they are.For example you have midlaner w/o any escape exept Flash.After one gank from the enemy jungler her died.Ok , I will forgive him , next time he will be more careful.Second time he died in the same way , somethings wrong here : Hey , bro you did the certain mistake , try not to make it again.\nResponse: FUCK YOU , ENEMY JUNGLER IS BETTER ! REPORT OUR JUNGLE.\nYou know for what I&#039;m talking about.League of Legends is mindgame , everything comes with a reason , if you don&#039;t use your head you will be nothing more than a fish in the ocean that is going to be eaten because of stupidity.\n_\n\n**4.IP per game is too small **\n_Believe me or not , for 4 years on my second account (maybe because I took too many breaks) I still don&#039;t have all champions and runes.\nIt will consume your lifetime and corrupt your soul ! Muhahahah ! _\n\n**5.The meta thing**\n_Double edged {{item:1038}} .Champions divided in lanes is great thing,playing only 20 champions from like 110 more champions is not realistic.\nWhats the point of having many champions when you play only 10 ? Champion diversity is gone from long time.\nEither one champion is super strong or super garbage._\n\nThere are more reasons ,but I need to go to work , have a pleasant day/night !  {{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-01-14T22:03:43.527+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Welcome to season 7.","replies":[]}]}
