[Shared Accounts](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204214670-Shared-accounts) are against the ToS. I suggest you just wait until you have access to your computer to check. The game isn't going anywhere, and having someone else check isn't going to fix anything for you. It could make things a whole lot worse though.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SKRRRRRRAT","date":"2017-12-28T05:29:01.394+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"when accounts get banned you can still login and see a message saying it's banned ","replies":[]},{"poster":"General Esdeath ","date":"2017-12-28T05:46:55.706+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"If it won't connect it's probably an issue with your phone/connection.
