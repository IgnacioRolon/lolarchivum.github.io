Many times games have had rather frustrating mechanics, but at the end those frustrating mechanics were either balanced or actually weak. In the case of Lee Sin, he's very ineffective at winning games for 99.9% of the player base and for the longest time has only ever had any positive impact when played by a professional. Lee Sin in soloq doesn't even maintain a 50% win rate even when played by people with hundreds of games. He is simply frustrating to play against since his success/fail rate is mainly up to the individual playing him rather than partially determined by his opponent, then there's the fact he's seen rather often and any champion eventually becomes annoying when they're picked 30%+ of the time.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BeMyFriendPlease","date":"2016-01-21T05:09:40.915+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So.... considering so many people complain\n\nAnd point out exactly why they hate him, many with unnecessarily detailed rationale....\n\nMaybe they have a point beyond the lee sin main's general response \"hes balanced cus muh skillcap\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"Streeton","date":"2016-01-21T04:35:13.490+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Board users hate him!\nIf you click on this link www.legitwebsitethathasnoscams.com you will find out the 3 ez steps to get free upvotes.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Maximum Morde","date":"2016-01-21T00:09:34.884+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm probably gonna use this from now on.
