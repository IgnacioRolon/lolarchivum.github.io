I walked into lane and noticed I was up against a Janna, I was alright with this and proceeded to farm and poke, she went AD Janna, (I noticed upon her basic attacking) I would wind wall not wanting to get screwed over by her damage, but every other crit or some basic attacks would just, Woosh strait through the wind wall and I had a hard time in lane because of it but ultimately won because op and ally warwick hit level six. I don't know what caused this but it is rather strange and I am hoping  this helps in some way.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Exgeniar","date":"2014-09-25T20:54:35.008+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can't reproduce this Q_Q\nIs the projectile appearing to be going the wall, but janna is just position in a way where the projectile will not be blocked?

Just me musing is all.\n\n> Had this same problem. It's like she has a random chance to get through Windwall. Like a hidden passive or something.\n\nIf it was a hidden passive, that would be so beautiful to me, an AD Janna to counter Yasuo, seeing as she does use wind magic it would only make sense that he can't stop her with a wall of wind.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kerson","date":"2014-09-25T18:28:21.655+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Had this same problem.
