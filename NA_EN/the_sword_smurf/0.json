Obviously the mods are going to stick to their guns on something they already (mistakenly) made a call on as being inappropriate. Maybe I thought that because the image wouldn&#039;t show up in the post and you&#039;d have to read through the link to see the picture there wouldn&#039;t be an issue or maybe I thought the mods would think critically for themselves on the matter and realize that, in retrospect, it was a dumb call in the first place. What I didn&#039;t expect was for someone on the boards to be a dick and instant report the post and get me banned within less than a minute.","replies":[]}
