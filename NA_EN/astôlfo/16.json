Binary is never healthy for the game. It's ok to have counters, but they should never be to the point where a champ has pretty much zero chance against them. \n\nIf you main a champ, you should be able to go against ANY other champ in the game and have a reasonable chance to win the matchup.

Same applies to Darius. Difference being Darius' pressure zone moves because he is the zone, Illaoi's being locked to the pit. Same with other juggernauts as well.\n\nI disagree. It's nowhere close to zero chance. It's just a matchup that's a bit harder than usual for most people because it relies on playing differently as they would compared to other matchups, and most people are not used to having to change their approach.\n\nIt's the same concept as Fiora for example, in the sense she's one of the best 1v1 duelists in the game. If you continually try to 1v1 her as you would say, I dunno, an Orianna, it's not going to work out. You need to get your team to help. Same idea here. If you continually try to out-bully/damage them in early, it probably won't work and you really shouldn't be trying it anyways.\n\nIt also usually helps a lot when there's a second presence to gank or CC or such in early, which is usually lacking in low ELO.\n\nIn addition, there are multiple melee matchups that Illaoi does go subpar or even with (not regarding winrates, but as in the kits and stats/etc themselves).

You can dodge the heal, but then you either get right next to him, which he wants, or you are zoned out of the area. Unlimited resets may be the most unhealthy mechanic in the game. Just look at how toxic it is on Kat, Tris, Jinx, etc. \n\nDuelists and high damage bruisers don't really need utility in their kits.

Also, the fact the heal is AoE means little when her teammates wouldn't be there to receive it unless it was like a 4-5 v 1 in the first place. If Fiora ulted someone in the middle of their entire team and still managed to get all 4 Vitals off/otherwise kill them with significant number of Vitals popped, the enemy team is garbage for not having done squat to stop her.\n\nDarius' Heal only applies if he hits enemy champions with his Q, which is incredibly slow in the first place. It also is not that large of a heal unless he hits multiple. If he's going against multiple in the first place, at least one of them should've applied GW on him or just CC'd him before Darius even got his Q off. The ult reset mechanism is very poor for _him_ actually, in contrast. It encourages killstealing because otherwise he cannot get the resets off, and he won't get more than 2 until level 16 anyways. He also won't be getting resets if someone just bothered to CC him and keep said lower health targets away and kiting him instead of attempting to duel a juggernaut while not dodging anything and eventually dying.\n\nNeither are much of a support.","replies":[{"poster":"Lugg","date":"2016-09-30T17:45:57.610+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Janna's ult is better, but due to the knockback, not the heal since it doesn't do as much. Soraka's ult doesn't heal near as much as Fioras. Yeah, Fiora's isn't instant like those, but it's not like it's hard to pull off. Hitting the vitals is very easy since she gets a very significant MS buff during the ult, has a dash if they flash, and to top it off she only needs to hit ONE vital to trigger it. Let's not forget that she also has 8 seconds to hit all four, which is an eternity in League. Also, she can easily do it next to the enemy team since if they focus her, her mid and ADC will wipe the other team. \n\n12% heal for hitting just one person is pretty large IMHO. Especially considering that he can use it at least twice in fights. Keeping low health targets away from his is pretty hard due to Apprehend.

Then what does \"2014-2015 Ranked Experience\" mean in reference to Win Rate by Percent Games Played?","replies":[{"poster":"ChaoticPinecone","date":"2016-09-29T17:19:58.765+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its difficult to say \"_____ IS WHAT IT MEANS,\" without accounting for all the possible variables. For example, a 60% winrate in Challenger means something different than a 60% winrate in Plat. A 60% winrate with 100 games played on the champion and 200 games overall is different than 100 games played on the champ but 5000 games overall. But heres a few possibilities that could explain it:\n\nFor champions like Mid Morde with a high winrate, low percent of games played, and a spread of Ranked Experience that starts with a very very low winrate and spikes to a high winrate, it might mean it is from dedicated Morde mains in the midlane who know the matchup. But lets be fair - not many people face a good Morde Midlane, so it might be a lack of experience from the opponent. Or it can also be from Morde Top players who queue as Top/Mid and selectively picking into good matchups when they get mid and happen to get into a good matchup. \n\nFor champions like Top Kayle with a high winrate, most games played at the 5-15 Ranked Experience and a highest winrate at that level, it could be that Kayle is being picked in favorable matchups. For people who main Kayle and are willing to pick her into any matchup, that winrate drops.\n\nFor Illaoi her winrate goes from 45% to 58% linearly based on the Ranked Experience. Her winrate goes from 53% to 48% based on the game length, again pretty linearly. This might be because as your experience on her goes up, you know how to put down more pressure in lane and snowball a game out of control before 30 minutes. This also might explain why her E max has a higher winrate than her Q max - Q max allows you to oneshot a wave, but E allows you more dualing power/poke/lane pressure.","replies":[{"poster":"Harvey Rabbit","date":"2016-09-30T05:57:38.167+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Great post, I think you are totally on point. But what I meant is literally: what does it mean that for that particular statistic champion.gg specifies \"2014-2015 ranked experience\"? If they are using the amount of games with that champion in 2014-2015 to select the pool to draw the data from,  then that could be a vanishingly small sample size in many cases where the particular champion or role has been very unpopular.\n\nMost people see the \"Win Rate % by Games Played\" statistic and assume it means that players who have played that number of games with the champion are having that much success, or lack thereof, but since there is a parenthetical \"(2014-2015 Ranked Experience)\" attached to the statistic it indicates to me that it is not so straightforward. Nothing in the site's faq explains what \"(2014-2015 Ranked Experience)\" means, but if it means simply what it sounds like then it is not the statistic it seems to be and not necessarily a useful statistic at all.","replies":[{"poster":"ChaoticPinecone","date":"2016-09-30T06:55:16.154+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ya know, I havent looked into it.

But at the same time the volatiility of the win % based on ranked experience makes me suspicious, like the op, that there is something amiss with that statistic.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Craft Zeppelin","date":"2016-09-29T01:27:14.082+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"even with a large sample size the website is a literal troll producing factory\nLike ADC first item hurricane rush has 56% winrate RIGHT?","replies":[{"poster":"GayFluffyUnicorn","date":"2016-09-29T09:53:13.323+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's what adcs do. \nAtleast the crit building ones. \nGet zeal, bf sword, finish runaans or rush runaans immediately.\nCrit is so much stronger than prior seasons.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ciller","date":"2016-09-29T14:07:21.934+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Except that's what the strongest ADCs do.
