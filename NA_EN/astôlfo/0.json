Yeah, Q dodging to avoid actual skillshots or CC or such might take a bit more skill, but for the most part, you really don&#039;t even need that because most people can&#039;t time for crap. So you just go about hitting them and rolling on your keyboard, they die, you get a kill or assist, go farm jungle some more.\nHooray, now you got Devourer.\nNow you just start tearing through things in the jungle as you rush Sated, while still having stupid strong ganks.\n\nOh right, his ult.\nWhy on earth is it every 75 seconds?\nFor what it can do, 75s feels absurdly short, considering you&#039;ll probably get at least 1-2 kills/assists, further extending the duration it&#039;s actually up, which is more than enough to chase someone to your next kill or just run away.\nSure, it&#039;s not like a point-and-click delete, but between your damage and the Q point, you&#039;ll still melt most people anyways.\n\nThen you probably get Guinsoo&#039;s by this point, and Sated more or less shortly after/before.\nNow you really just shred people into nothing.\nAAs go so fast the animation just looks almost funny at that point, and you can see their health bar just vanishing in seconds.\nUnless you somehow manage to get like every CC on you, the only way you&#039;ll really die is being caught out with low health when you don&#039;t have your W up (read: not often). Or, tanking tower shots which do just about nothing while you essentially have a dance party after you melt the person/people you were chasing and then realize you stayed too long.\n\nOh fun, now I have BotRK.\nHello, my low health, goodbye, my low health.\nHello, my enemi- wait where&#039;d they go? Oh they&#039;re all dead.\nOh cool, my life is all the way back up to full.\n\n/rant\n\nAnyways...\n\nFeel free to offer your opinions.\nAm I just bad and is this just my delusions of some supposedly absurdly stupid champ that really isn&#039;t?\nOr is there any actual merit to it?\n\nEDIT: I have a relatively high number of games on him, but that's from wayyy back before any of this stupid Sated Guinsoo's shit was out, and I was just mucking around with Six Swords glass cannon, which was still stupid, but fun, and at least not so stupid as this imo.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Sotere","date":"2016-04-11T06:18:33.259+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":4,"body":"You are definitely not alone in your feeling.

On top of his already 40-100% AS spike he's balanced around. So when his conditions are met he can have 192% more AS and his on hits are supposed to be balanced around 40% AS and a spike to 100% AS. He uses his 100% spike almost naturally and then almost doubles his natural spike with the new build. \n\nThen even after that he has 60 more on hit damage then he should, 5% current HP damage, and then the real kicker every second hit he doubles that shit. 120 magic damage, 10% current health, double true damage, faster double strike. \n\nEither they gut all his on hits damage to adjust it to the new AS and Devourer, or they gut the items.
