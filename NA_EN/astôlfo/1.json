It was intended to help them clear the jungle but ended up providing too much duelling power.","replies":[{"poster":"leopard nidálee","date":"2016-09-11T17:37:16.377+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Why not just let Kindred heal off of their marks only? That way, they don't always have full health in the jungle and won't have insane dueling power, it WILL make their mark-invades safer, making them less team-reliant. It also puts more pressure on marking the correct target because the player will have to take the heal they _could_ get into consideration when invading and ganking.\n\nI definitely think a buff to their early game stats wouldn't be uncalled for, or perhaps something as simple as preventing it from marking inside the enemy jungle as the first mark. For me, games where the scuttlecrab is marked first end up a lot better than ones where raptors are the first mark.","replies":[{"poster":"Astôlfo","date":"2016-09-13T22:49:01.362+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Um no, because then they're still as garbage as ever, and by the time they get to said Hunt while running around, they'd have full stacks and get a minor heal.
