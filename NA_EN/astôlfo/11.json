The issue is, with a good Yasuo player, unless you have multiple critical skillshots on your team that Yasuo would be forced to block separately, he just wouldn't use it until he saw the one key skillshot being used. And then he just impulse-clicks the wall randomly to instantly block it off from him and anyone else behind him.\n\nYes, I'm fine with Yasuo being an infuriating little goddamn shit to play against. Yes, I think crit-Yasuo (not tank Yasuo, fuck that cancer) is generally fine in terms of balance, even if he is, like I said, an infuriating little goddamn shit to play against. No, I would prefer if he couldn't just panic-click his windwall whenever to instantly block any projectile even if it's point-blank and would've hit his model except the windwall spawns from the center of his model with no delay or cast time that instantaneously blocks everything around him in every direction instead of the direction it got sent towards.\n\nEDIT: Yay, people downvoting for no visible reason because they don't bother to actually reply and explain.","replies":[{"poster":"Squidward Dab","date":"2016-09-10T22:18:24.642+0000","up_votes":28,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree. \n\nIf he sees an Ashe ult or some other projectile coming his way and he panics and windwalls the COMPLETE OPPOSITE direction of where the ult is coming from, he deserves to get hit by it, not destroy the projectile. \n\nSorry to shatter ur dreams and the fact you can't place the windwall in the right direction cuz you panicked","replies":[{"poster":"Astôlfo","date":"2016-09-11T15:48:03.720+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":2,"body":"What do you mean?\nI see absolutely no problem here:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxtDg1tCgZk","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"sdsdfdf","date":"2016-09-10T21:19:14.772+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":35,"body":"yes it is too much to ask for. no reason to nerf him atm","replies":[{"poster":"Astôlfo","date":"2016-09-10T21:24:47.747+0000","up_votes":23,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's a nerf I guess, but it should have been this way in the first place.
