That is why Lethality, the stat now replacing armor pen, has level scaling. It takes some of that power out of the early game and moves it to the mid and late game. This way ranged can still build it without being OP while doing so and the melee champions can still get some use out of it as well. It was never once intended to be only for Melee champions, ranged champions just used to abuse it better than melee could and Riot wanted them to be able to abuse it equally.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Valor Bot","date":"2017-01-13T02:35:49.480+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Burst isn't solely what defines an Assassin though, but also high mobility and single target selection.

But, that's a 2v2 match up. Completely different. I don't see many people playing Sivir top lane, just like I don't see many people playing Jayce bot. That doesn't have much to do with just melee/ranged. The champs that go bot lane typically are extremely item reliant. So they go there to have a support get them to their status. That's why you don't see every ADC going top. Because they won't spike as quickly in a 1v1 lane, and melee champs will have an easier time hitting their spikes. The reason you don't see champs like Yi bot is because it's 2v2. The support can hard zone the champ off and not have to worry about losing cs for it.
