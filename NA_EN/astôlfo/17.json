The repositioning effect makes charm a better engage, but fear a better disengage, resulting in them being about the same in over-all power. While Suppress itself is just like Charm and Fear, only without the movement (making it a neutral version of Charm/Fear), the implementation within this game has it combined with a pulling displacement or a self-suppress, making it very definitely a Tier 2 ability.\n* **--Tier 2: _Situational Disable or Interrupt_--**\n* Silence basically shuts down anything that isn't mindless right-clicking (even ADCs dislike being silenced), making it useful in both engage and disengage\n* While the core of Suppress has it in Tier 1, all implementations currently in the game either also suppress yourself (Malzahar, Urgot, Warwick) or combine it with a Pulling Displacement (Skarner, Kench), forcing it to be Tier 2 because its implementation makes it obligate engage.\n* Taunt is a full disable, but they autoattack you. Situationally really powerful, but also situationally terrible (taunting the fed ADC when low on HP is never a good idea). You can really only use it to engage, not disengage. It also cancels on the source unit's death\n* Displacement is very much like Knockup.... but can be accidentally used to save an enemy or kill an ally as it forces rapid, oft significant movement (unlike charm/fear, which force slowed, minor movement). This makes it significantly more risky than Suppress or Taunt. Also note that a Push Displacement is better than a Pull displacement, as the former can be used both as engage and disengage, while a pull displacement can only disengage in a sacrificial manner.\n* **--Tier 3: _Useful Non-Interrupt_--**\n* Snare is great for disengage, but is really only for setup / press purposes on engage. It is, however, very powerful against champions that specialize in not holding still (Ahri, Zed, LeBlink, etc) as it blocks a good portion of what they do.\n* Slows are like snares in that they function mostly as disengage and setup / press, but unlike snares, it doesn't effect ability based movement, so Ahri, Zed, LeBlink, etc are significantly less hamstrung by it.\n* **--Tier 4: _Situational Only_--**\n* Pacify actually disables the ability to autoattack, making it stronger than blind, but it has nearly the exact same effect. IIRC the only advantage it really has is Blind's weird interactions with a few on-attack/hit effects, which lets it edge blind out just a little.\n* Blind is only useful against autoattackers, and some of them can even mitigate it with abilities. Very situational outside of lane phase, though can win a teamfight if used right, but \"oh no, I'm the mage/tank/ad-caster and I'm blind.\"\n\nOf course, anything Tier 2 or higher (on this scale)  is pretty damn good to have, so...\n\nEDIT ONE: Thanks to Ninja Swaggy for pointing out I gooffed on defining Suppression. I didn't really move it much, but it is technically possible to be Tier 1 if someone were to get a suppress that wasn't combined with a self-suppress or a pull displacement, and thus could use it to disengage.\n\nEDIT TWO:  Thanks to Yetii Rider for pointing out out I missed Pacify.

They kept the one part of his kit that i enjoyed then simplified it to the point that it's boring.\n\nI've said this time and time again, the new reworked kit is mechanically broken. You can't balance it ever! It will forever be in flux between being useless or completely insanely powerful. \n\nRiot failed in pretty much every way with the malzahar rework, almost 100% because of the voidlings. \n\nIMO, because they will never admit to fucking up and revert the rework, i proposed they swap his passive for his W. Turn his W into a kind of fiora W. And return his passive to a state which allows for a couple of strong voidlings rather than a swarm of weak ones.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Teslablade","date":"2016-05-08T14:11:39.991+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Long-time Malzahar player here: I definitely wanted the rework, but all of his oppresive aspects have been amplified.
