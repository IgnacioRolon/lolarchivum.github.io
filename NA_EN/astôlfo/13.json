The specific numbers don't really matter. The % tells me either \"My shunpo will come up almost instantly after picking up a dagger\" or \"My shunpo will take a second or two to come up after picking up a dagger,\" much faster than a specific number, which is what matters the most.\n\nHaving the tooltip read specific numbers takes more time to figure out than % numbers. Let's say my shunpo is on an 8.1 second cooldown [level 3 shunpo 10% cdr] and I'm at level 11 [90% reduction on dagger pickup]. With these numbers the tooltip, with your reccomendation, would say \"Picking up a dagger will reduce shunpo's cooldown by 7.3 seconds\". \n\nAt this point I've realized I've put too much time into this and there was really no point because there is such a little difference LOL.. \n\nbut anyways; 8.1 - 7.3 is what you would have to do in your head, but in reality you don't need the specific number to plan out your assassination. Just a general % number works slightly better.","replies":[{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2016-11-28T06:57:36.938+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"A specific number will tell you exactly how long you have to wait before jumping to it to have it instantly back up though.","replies":[{"poster":"Eclipse1337","date":"2016-11-28T20:50:25.840+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But I'm too lazy to calculate that :3","replies":[{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2016-11-28T22:51:32.197+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can also wait until the time visible as Shunpo's CD reaches that same number that would be in the tooltip.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Wheatloaf","date":"2016-11-28T08:49:06.854+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If I understand correctly, it reduces the remaining cooldown of the ability, not the base cd.
