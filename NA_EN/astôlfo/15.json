In fact, I'd say that Riot is finally satisfied with the level of her early strength (clear speed, clear healthiness, early game damage to champions) and now looks to put power back into her in a way to fulfill her overall fantasy. And these buffs look (to me, at least) good on that front - more AD growth factor is only a major boon in the later stages (remember, base stats grow in a nonlinear fashion), and %-based damage is also only a major factor in the mid-to-late game.","replies":[{"poster":"Astôlfo","date":"2016-08-24T07:04:34.542+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"The issue is she's literally worthless in lategame except as an ult-bot unless she gets her Hunts.\nAnd to get said Hunts, she needs a somewhat stronger early so she can actually get them without just suffering at being unable to even clear her own jungle that well let alone invade or kill others.\nBut yeah.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CaptnJakSparrow","date":"2016-08-23T23:03:51.943+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I honestly don't think 30 additional damage to her level 3 combo is going to matter.  \n\nThe only real significance to this buff is that her clear speed is increased by . . . roughly 2 seconds.
