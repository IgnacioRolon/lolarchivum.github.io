The ones asking for this were mostly the bad players who didn&#039;t already know or want to bother learning the pre-existing counterplay. The rework succeeded in that sense.\n\nHowever, the general approach was by increasing the burst times with massive delays so that there was plenty of time to react to said assassination attempt. In return, the damage for actually landing said combo means it would hit far harder.\n\nWhen the ones complaining in the first place are the ones who are fairly bad, it seems like the only thing that would happen is the bad players would get hurt even worse while better players would generally just laugh and pick a mage instead of an assassin, and then play at their high-tier of play.\n\nIf a high-tier player (outside of the top like Faker or such) played just about any assassin (excluding LeBlanc, Kha&#039;Zix, and/or Rengar, possibly Katarina?), they probably would not get very far, due to how incredibly long the potential reaction time is, as well as being able to avoid the combo&#039;s main damage altogether for most of the current reworked assassins fairly easily.\n\nLike, yes, congratulations, they are more potentially complex and potentially rewarding, but outside of a few exceptions, almost all of them would be completely useless in the face of a half-competent player. On the other hand, the lower-tier players who already can&#039;t dodge skillshots or respect kill zones/pressure timers and cooldowns would just get stomped even harder, and then probably complain even more.\n\nEDIT: If you're going to downvote, at least bother posting why you disagree.

I won't disagree that there's some problems in their counterplay and their targets, but I feel that can be fixed with some Qol buffs. \n\nHonestly the biggest issue I see is that divers do the assassin job better because they effectively function like old assassins but lack the escape (and get durability instead).

And while Talon after the rework needs some lovetaps to push him into a better stop, he is by no means \"ruined\". Not even close.\n\nHis kit is eons more well rounded and and balanced, and way more fulfilling than it was before and that alone makes it a success in my book.\nWinnrates are low? Ok all that means is i can expect my boi to get some buffs in the future.\nI don't see an issue with that.\n\nAnd lastly, Talon was already a \"second jungler\", as he spent more time goign botlane for double kills than laning with his opponent before, assuming the enemy wasn't ass, as Talon hasn't been in anythign close to a good spot since the Marksman update.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Squey","date":"2016-11-28T18:08:30.998+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"While i agree with you, i also agree with the person above you. \nAs a talon main, i loved playing him every time it was viable, ( knowing the lane opponent and team not needed ap)\nbut he wasnt in a good enough spot pre-rework to pick blind. \nNow he is not only more enjoyable, diverse, and active in fights.

The delayed damage on their kits also means that a snowballing Assassin can usually assassinate their targets while holding their escape tools (Rengar's W, Katarina's W, Talon's wall jump if he doesn't use it to enter a fight), but can choose to sacrifice those tools for more reliable assassination if they're even or behind.\n\nIt's preseason, so Riot has a lot of tuning to do, but I'm calling it a success as things start to settle down.","replies":[{"poster":"Sraeg2013","date":"2016-11-28T20:22:46.649+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Except that Zed actually gains more AD from an ADC with only IE with 1st rank of the ultimate, than he used to with W until like level 14 while having 300 AD.\n\nJhin is the only exception, but hardly a counterpick.","replies":[{"poster":"AgentBlack","date":"2016-11-28T20:46:24.569+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's the point, though: now Zed actively wants to kill the ADC as opposed to just any squishy that comes in range.  He's stronger when he can do so, but weaker when his priority target is non-AD, a la Cassiopeia or Soraka.

And in the meantime, he may be focused on an AD Champion at the expense of a higher priority, non-AD target.\n\nAs Zed stands now, he's rewarded for prioritizing AD Champions, and punished when he can't.  This logically makes him better against teams with more AD Champions, especially ones that prioritize stacking AD.
