He&#x27;s just the quintessential fighter in many ways with decent mobility.m\n\nAll the diamond players say that. And yet there's something that's always noticed every single time. \n\nLook at the winrates of those players.\n\nThere's like 1-2 challenger tryndamere players, and it took them thousands upon thousands of queues to get there, and they still only have a 49-50% winrate.  Many other players can't even get out of plat 2 as Trynd, and there's only one viable Trynd strategy. Mindlessly shove the lane and hope you win.  There's no skill or anything involved. It's just mindlessly shove.\n\nThe only time I see the very vacant Urgot one tricks they're around D2 at best and the only time they ever get that high is when the champion actually has a favorable meta. Otherwise they rot in plat/low diamond. \n\nAll of those extremely weak champions typically rot in low diamond, no matter whose playing them. \n\nAnd in challenger, unless you're already way up in challenger playing a weak champion will get you demoted out of challenger fast. And climbing with a weak champion in diamond will net you an extremely poor winrate that is all for intents and purposes wasting time.\n\nFor ex:\n\nI made it to around D3 as Kindred in a very bad meta while she's weak af. But I lost every single game I was up against Gragas/ Zac and broke even on Graves games, but only because I am often a much much better jungler than the plat 5 skill level Graves player abusing freelo. But often times he can be absolutely terrible and win anyways becausehis champ was brain damage proof. \n\nI very very very very easily could have hit d2-1 if I put all of my effort on Graves/Zac/Gragas. Instead I sit tilted in D5 playing at 4 am watching my challenger players intentionally run down mid to die because I picked a terrible champ I.E Kindred.","replies":[{"poster":"JedenVojak","date":"2016-11-24T00:43:58.481+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=CaptnJakSparrow,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=boywYN9i,comment-id=000700000000,timestamp=2016-11-23T22:07:53.798+0000)\n>\n> There&#x27;s like 1-2 challenger tryndamere players, and it took them thousands upon thousands of queues to get there, and they still only have a 49-50% winrate.

The best possible strength they have is how fast they can clear caster minions. Aurelion and Taliyah were able to do this at level 1 faster than anyone else, it made them broken S+tier.\n\nJungle: It's how fast they can clear birds so that they can outspeed the other jungle to gank faster. Currently Ivern is one of the best because of this. He can be level 4 ganking while you're still level 2 fucking with birds. \n\nAdc: It boils down to the meta. The current meta is assassin fotm, so naturally Vayne is broken + she has a numbers advantage. In a poke meta Varus usually reigns supreme.  Early game metas usually turn to Lucian due to his abusive snowbally nature against other adcs. \n\nSupport: if it's a lane meta, Zyra reigns suprement. But a roaming meta Bard and Ali usually take charge. \n\nTop lane: usually boils down to very gimmicky bullshit. But the current meta is who can afk farm to get zzrots and mindlessly shove. At the current moment Yorick and Nasus are basically Gods at this. \n\nThese are usually what determine the champion pools of the meta. But give or take numbers shifts popularity. \n\nCass and Syndra are insanely powerful due to their wave clear + utility + assassination potential. So naturally, Ziggs is coming back because he can wave clear just like them while also afking under turret so he can't feed.  So, the very reason people pick cass and syndra he prevents, while also being able to gank with ult. \n\nIt's also why I'm going full AD Reksai in the jungle. People are picking fotm assassins, more commonly known farming champions. I pick Reksai who as full ad has one of the fastest clears in the game + really strong burst potential and I can quite frankly take complete control of the game before the majority of the other champs can even get enough items to deal with me because Rek'sai is one of the most cost efficient junglers in that I don't need items to  pull off good damage/what I need to do. All I need to start taking charge of the game is 1200 gold.  No other jungler can take the game under the belt with that little gold. It'll take a good while for people to catch on to this, and 90% of the Reksai players, save for like a very small hand full will actually acknowledge this as well.  In fact, LoL's balance team hasn't caught on either and they're buffing Reksai x3. \n\nIn case you think Idk what I'm talking about involving Rek'sai.\n\nhttp://puu.sh/ssIGx/6f3e18f9fd.jpg\n\nhttp://puu.sh/ssIIY/eaa7a49f6a.jpg\n\nhttp://puu.sh/ssIKR/426b61c9f0.jpg <-- my cs.\n\nhttp://puu.sh/ssILR/5ab172a7f5.jpg <-- Enemy Lee Sin's.\n\nhttp://puu.sh/ssIOI/7749d2a925.jpg <-- My cs\n\nhttp://puu.sh/ssIPV/a9a6994d71.jpg  <-- Enemy Elise.\n\nIt's not uncommon for me to get a 4-5 level lead on the other jungler.
