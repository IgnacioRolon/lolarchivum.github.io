I don't believe we're currently banning for Overwolf, but that can change at any time.  Also keep in mind that we wouldn't be able to offer any support if you ran into issues with the game, or if any malicious content were found hiding in a third party program.  More information can also be found in our[ third party guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/225266848).

Another question then would be is if it isnt bannable now, if it gets an update in the future that makes it bannable but i removed it before that point, am I ok?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-04-04T16:42:06.161+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not part of the team that makes those decisions, but I'm pretty sure we'd want to give a heads up first.
