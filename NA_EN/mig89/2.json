All items would just be different variants of the stats they give without actives or passive for the hidden power they provide. No more deathcap give bonus % ap. No more IE giving increased crit damage.\r\nLimits the stats items could give to:\r\nHealth\r\nArmor\r\nMagic Resist\r\nHealth Regen.\r\nAD\r\nAP\r\nArmor/Magic Pen\r\nAttack Speed\r\nCrit Chance\r\nMovement speed\r\nMaybe Tenacity\r\nLife Steal\r\nI might be missing some\r\nI think this would give Riot an easier out to balance the game but the downside is it might be a little boring. No more Greivous wounds or bonus healing from items. No more bonus shielding. No more duskblade procs for stepping briefly into a bush. No more Bork, No more immolate, No more rylais slow, etc\r\nThey could buff kits to compensate\r\nHavent had coffee yet so take the idea with a grain of salt.","replies":[{"poster":"Marshbouy","date":"2017-08-17T13:05:11.767+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"It could possibly become more balanced but the game would become significantly more bland.","replies":[]},{"poster":"fuffychan","date":"2017-08-17T13:38:11.200+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That would be extremely boring.

The game is imbalanced because it is fun. Although, it really isn't that imbalanced as it is compared to other games.","replies":[]}]}
