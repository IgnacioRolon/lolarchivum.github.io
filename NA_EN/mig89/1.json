I cant use any of my abilities without going and clicking on them and i cant even use hotkeys to open the store or use summoner spells. The only thing thats worked for me is exiting and reloading the game. It has been doing this since before the new client happened and I always dealt with it. It really only impacts me in the sense that I cant provide as good of a leash as id like being a zyra main and not having time to lay down seeds to have my plants tank for the jungler. (irrelevant to the issue but it does affect my playstyle.)","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-24T02:37:08.868+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you may either have issues with your input settings or there's a background application causing your inputs to not be recognized.
