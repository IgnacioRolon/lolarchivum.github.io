It&#039;s happened too many times where I am in the middle of the game and I start attempting to reconnect because you  have to do maintenance. Let ppl finish their game and force them to log out. Don&#039;t make &quot;Play&quot; an option for the 2 hours before you do maintenance its not fair. I&#039;m going to get back on league after wards and I wont have gained any exp or mastery points because you logged me (and the other players) out of our game. Please, FIX THIS.
