Is this intentional-if so why-or is it a simple typo.","url":"https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report/z5yYMvx2-omega-force-teemo","image":"https://cdn.leagueoflegends.com/apollo/assets/vb/boards-wallpaper.jpg"},"up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just earned a key and unlocked a hextech chest, I received 150 orange essence and it said that omega force teemo was unlocked permanently and added to my collection. I already activated omega squad teemo a long time ago, so shouldn't I have gotten the skin and if so I should have been able to disenchant for more orange essence, or is it related to the icon?  I checked and don't have a new icon. I searched previous posts for omega force teemo and saw a post that the icon was once called that but Riot KateyKhaos updated it. Has it not been updated for hextech rewards and is a glitch?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-07-25T22:56:10.009+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I looked into this for you and found that you unlocked the Omega Squad Teemo Summoner Icon, not the skin.  The messaging on unlocking icons are not super clear, but you should find it in your list of icons.  It's an older icon so you may need to scroll down a bit to locate it.  Let me know if that clears things up!","replies":[{"poster":"IronLeaguePro","date":"2017-07-25T23:39:23.643+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's there now, thanks.","replies":[]}]}]}
