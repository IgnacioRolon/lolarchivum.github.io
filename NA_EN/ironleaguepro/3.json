For the past few days, randomly when a match completes, I get a black screen and cannot access my computer. My mouse still shows but it is all black. I don't have league blocked on a firewall, and everything always works fine. I did just buy a 25 foot cat-6 ethernet cord so I could get off wireless. I also use Lolwiz, which is the only other thing I think could be causing it. I did find an old post with a similar problem but I did not see any solution. Does anyone else have this issue or know how to fix it?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-23T22:59:13.685+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Third-party programs have a tendency of causing issues throughout the game loop.

It would happened to me right after i hit \"continue\" after the end of every match.\n\nSomething that would sometimes (rarely) work for me would be to hit continue and IMMEDIATELY hit alt+tab right after, before the black screen appeared. The ONLY way i could get rid of the black screen and go back to desktop was to close my laptop and open it back up. \n\nI didn't have any third-party apps and i never have so idk if thats actually the issue. I also tried to reinstall league but it didn't work. I had this problem for a while up until a few patches ago and it went away on its own. \n\nLastly, i dont know if this helps but i did update my drivers shortly before this issue occurred and for some reason my League of Legends icon on my desktop showed up as a blank page icon around the time that the black screen bug occurred. It still shows up as a blank page icon to this day instead of the regular League icon.","replies":[]},{"poster":"IronLeaguePro","date":"2016-08-25T21:31:01.522+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"all I can see is the cursor, although randomly clicking doesn't do anything either.","replies":[]},{"poster":"IronLeaguePro","date":"2016-08-25T21:28:42.406+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's a black screen for the entire computer.

I seldom randomly get the black screen now, although it still occurs.  I have avg, which has little pop ups in the corner from time to time. There is an option in avg, which prevents notifications during a full screen app i believe game mode. When you finish a game, and avg decides to give you an offer it must conflict or something and goes to the black screen.  I set the maximum frequency of in-app offers to 3 a day which is the lowest you can go before buying.
