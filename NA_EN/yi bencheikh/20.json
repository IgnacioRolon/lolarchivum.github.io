Our meta is very resistant to shifting as many players choose to copy what works at higher levels of play.\n\nBack in Season 3, we didn't have keystones. Supports had bonus experience masteries. Champions that were squishy and relied on teams didn't have to deal with the jungler or mid ganking their lane with Thunderlords Decree and Chilling Smite. Supports didn't fall 2-3 levels behind everyone else in the game. \n\nThe bot lane meta doesn't work anymore, that's why ADCs are constantly demanding lethality or crit scaling on kits, because they cannot simply rush BT (season 3 was also very good to ADCs because of 100 AD BT, you know) and do well in the mid game.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightshade Rose","date":"2017-05-28T18:53:07.296+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So you're saying problem is that unlike other roles theres no place in current meta for marksmen, let alone traditional supports?

However, Riot has refused to do so, likely to avoid the experience boost being poached by mid and top laners. \n\nInstead, they give us more XP when we get a kill or assist on someone who is higher level (so if you're 4 levels behind the target, not going to happen. They'll just kill you first), XP when you kill a ward (joy) and XP if you die within 10 seconds of an enemy dying and don't get an assist. \n\nAnd unsurprisingly, as all of this just makes the floor lower but doesn't help if you're not smack dab against the bottom of the floor, supports are still weak and still underleveled, to the point where passive supports get an item that gives them an extra skill rank because Riot knows they're behind in levels so much.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightshade Rose","date":"2017-05-28T22:26:15.497+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So they are passively removing support class.

Fine it can be that with that item you cannot get gold from minion kills or make it instead of 100% exp to 90% - 80%. Those who buy relic shield won&#x27;t be at dissadvantage because they get a passive shield, that is quite helpful, how useful queens tribute ia can&#x27;t say because i don&#x27;t really see diffrence with it or without it, i guess movespeed is nice but thats it and if the game gets to lategame it won&#x27;t matter anyways because they&#x27;ll be at lvl 18 anyways and in lategame shield from face of the mountain and extra damage, movespeed from thieves edge still going to be of use while that exp you got back in midgame, will be useless. With such passive support gets extra exp when he competes his quest from minion kills, by him or nearby allies. Remember that i&#x27;m suggesting new quest reward and not stand in for quest itself.\n\nIf it gets to late game they WONT all be 18, that's the problem. Supports are still 16 at 40 minutes these days.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightshade Rose","date":"2017-05-31T18:36:19.353+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahhh, but they'll still have effects of their support item at lvl 16 while you with coin will have lvl 18 and no effect. You can argue that 2 lvl higher is better then effects at lvl 16 but remember that they'll eventually get to that lvl 18 with those effects while you'll only have lvl18. Also your experiance gain depends on your performance like with any role, if you stay at bot with your adc entire early and some mid game, while you're only farming and getting no kills you'll be behind, but if you try and roam mid you'll get assist experiance, gold and probably a turret, maybe first turret, while getting experiance from minion deaths near you while in midlane. Coins effect would let you achieve lvl 18 faster trading away gold from minions and any late game effect.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
