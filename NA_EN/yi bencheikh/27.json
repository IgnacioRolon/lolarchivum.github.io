I'd say his issues are that he does way too much damage innately, especially for how tanky he gets. And for all that potential upside, with his ult being game changing, keep in mind it can lose games as much as it can win games.\n\nOutside of that, he doesn't bug me","replies":[]},{"poster":"Unpaladin","date":"2016-08-31T23:02:45.322+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Whoah whoah wait a minute you can't say things like that gragas is uh totally fine and good for the game, riot even condones pros picking him year round\ns-so what if he does everything perfectly while others don't that's b-balanced","replies":[]},{"poster":"XDDD","date":"2016-08-31T22:48:05.656+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I could literally list every champion's kits and make them sound overpowered like you do with Grag, even the weakest ones.

That being said I would love if they just remove the ability to use flash during his body slam. Flash should interrupt what movement spell you're using and not instead be used as a guaranteed feature for him and shen to land their CC. This way he would be much less of an issue and wouldn't require to be as gutted.","replies":[]}]}
