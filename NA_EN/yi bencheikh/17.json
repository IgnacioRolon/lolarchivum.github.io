What you described is basically D&D with a Runeterra setting, which I'm sure plenty of people already do. I'm sure a lot of people think it'd be cool to serve justice at Garen's side, rise through Noxus' ranks on pure strength to be Darius's right hand, or ally with Xayah and Rakan to restore the magic to Ionia (or die cause Xayah is racist). It's why people like games with customizable main characters like the older Final Fantasies, or Dragon Warrior/Quests. You get to be the hero.\n\nMeanwhile people do waifus/husbandos because they're often something that don't exist in real life, like fox girls, dragon girls, harpies, lamias, magical girls etc. They all just appeal to fantasies, just one is romantic, and the other is platonic.","replies":[{"poster":"Jet Sett","date":"2017-04-29T04:41:52.616+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fiction is capable of invoking feelings like happiness or sadness, it's no surprise that for some it invokes feelings of love (platonic or otherwise)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Valaran Nara","date":"2017-04-29T05:21:11.076+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=AbsorbantTNT,realm=NA,application-id=Ir7ZrJjF,discussion-id=BzvGNNVO,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2017-04-28T23:10:21.927+0000)\n>\n> The concept of a fictional wife has never appealed to me as much as the concept of fictional comrades-in-arms.\n> \n> Maybe it&#x27;s just because I&#x27;m wierd, but it would be really cool to traveling Valoran at Poppy&#x27;s side as a faithful friend to seek the hero of Demacia (even if I know that she&#x27;s actually the hero). Marrying her or anyone else just seems kinda dumb.\n\nHonestly, I can't see that last part.  Like, being a comrade in arms makes sense to me because of admiration and wanting to work with another you know have your back (I mean, I did basic training in the military and ROTC, so I've been drilled the concept), but the bit about knowing she's the hero...You have to have some kind of feelings for the girl if you know she's the thing she's looking for.  At which point, I can only believe the platonic part if you actually tried to convince and drill it through her skull, but she refuses.","replies":[{"poster":"EvilUnicornLord","date":"2017-04-29T06:35:03.798+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're completely right.
