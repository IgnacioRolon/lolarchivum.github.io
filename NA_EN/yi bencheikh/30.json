Riot's one of my favourites when it comes to character design, they always come up with such beautifully done champions. Everything from their lore to their overall aesthetic is always just \n{{sticker:sg-kiko}} \n\nOf all the champion's in the game though, {{champion:127}} takes the cake in terms of character design for me. She's THE champion that actually got me to look into the lore of league. Like League lore isn't bad by any means, but I could never quite get fully invested into it like I do with other games' lore. Lissandra's design as a whole just clicked with me in general and I just had to find out more about her. Her graceful but imposing demeanor and almost alien monolithic figure, that amazing voice work and probably the most satisfying and visceral skill animations and audio cues. Her background which was just awesome and badass, even the fact that she's one of the few purely black character in the game. Like she's not evil because of some tragic backstory, she just straight up wants to enslave the world under the Watchers and it's all for power. I just love that about her, rarely do you find villains who are just evil for the sake of evil anymore. They always have some ridiculous background to make us more sympathetic to their cause, and while I don't necessarily hate that, I do grow tired of it.

First off, he's a necromancer THAT FIGHTS WITH A SHOVEL. Not some gaunt sorcerer or wizard; he's literally a gravedigger who can raise and command the dead.\n\nSecondly, unlike most melee toplane fighters, he has no swaggering bravado or confidence. Instead, he wearily goes about his endless, dreary task, resisting the ever-present urge to cast aside the spirit water which and join the black mist (sardonically tying in to his ingame role as a splitpusher). Except the means to complete his task require him to use the black mist, which constantly compells him to give in. And apparently this has been Yorick's day-to-day for the last few centuries.\n\nThridly, Yorick's ultimate, Eulogy of the Isles. Super unique ult that permanently summons a powerful, uncontrollable monster and plays this haunting organ music while alive.\n\nTaric is my other favorite. I love the names of his abilities - Starlight's Touch and Cosmic Radiance.

If you can survive until lvl 3, you can start killing the enemy with your combo.

That's legit 2-3 months.  Gameplay-wise, you don't need to wait too long to see if she'll be best utility or actual damage.","replies":[{"poster":"rtbf225618241","date":"2017-10-10T18:39:22.009+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They slapped some damage-steroid passives on her and nerfed her utility in response so she does damage with her basic attacks after using abilities. Kind of like how Riven works.\n\nI doubt the Runes will completely switch her playstyle around to the point they'll go back on their decisions (which Riot almost never does).","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Blessed By RNG","date":"2017-10-10T13:43:41.837+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"World of Warcraft has better lore and story","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rinký Dinky","date":"2017-10-12T02:22:46.883+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You implied Jhin has an issue with gameplay.

I adore the majority of their designs, I think a couple of their designs need work though, leblanc, Morgana, and Akali come to mind.  I mean Akali is beautiful, and I mean SERIOUSLY beautiful, but her ninja suit should match Shen and kennen in being full coverage.  Also, id love seeing Morgana in full dark purple armor like Kayle's, and leblanc is the only deceiver in league that doesn't use her feminine, charms.  Cass, Elise, Evelynn, and to a lesser extent ahri use their feminity, but leblanc doesn't.","replies":[{"poster":"Sexy Jack Rabbit","date":"2017-10-11T00:04:42.615+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Really?
