(I think one might be Kobe, because of the voice, but I'm not sure).\r\n\r\nWatching the matches is extra fun because of them, and I know it must be tiresome to cover so many matches in one day (since in LCK the matches are best of 3). So I just wanted to shout out to them and say thanks for the hard work! You make my day. :)\r\n\r\nCheers from Brazil!

Doa also casts other games(at least Hearthstone), and he sued to be a Starcraft caster for IPL before that stopped. Not sure about Monte's background entirely, i just remember DOA from watching IPL a lot lol.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Diamonesd","date":"2015-02-02T17:18:42.893+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, those two are the best.
