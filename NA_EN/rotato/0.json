We regularly face high diamond 1 teams and half the time we face high rated challenger teams in tournaments. We are committed fully, me especially as captain and manager of our team. I have put countless hours into making this team work and succeed for us and will not let it just fade away.\n\nExpectations: I expect if you add me you will NOT RAGE, you will be able to play at the high diamond level of competition we regularly compete at in weekly tournaments (if you cannot, do not bother adding me or replying to this forum), you will not take elo as a factor in my decision making or team managing skills (in other words, elo elitists need not apply), and you are willing to take criticism and realize that although we may not be perfect as a team or as individual players we're looking to improve together as a team for the long haul.\n\nAlso let it be known that if you can provide me with a video of one of your games your chances of making the team will be GREATLY INCREASED as it saves me the trouble of trying you out, I do not use lolreplay so you will have to either upload them to youtube or find some other way to get them to me.\n\n\nIf you are interested in joining our team please add GGP Rotato in game or reply here using this format.\n\nSummoner name:\nRole:\nAge:\nRank:\nTeam experience:\nChampion Pool:\nTime Zone:\nAnything I should know:","replies":[{"poster":"Niqhtmare x","date":"2014-11-22T08:37:34.860+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just played you in ranked 5s o.o\n\nI don't play top, so obviously I'm not interested, but would you still care to tell me what the perks are?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rotato","date":"2014-11-25T07:41:04.176+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"bump","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rotato","date":"2014-11-25T07:13:19.520+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"bump","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rotato","date":"2014-11-25T05:54:46.693+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"bump","replies":[]},{"poster":"DaCush","date":"2014-11-24T20:52:43.702+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Summoner Name - DaCush\nRole - I dominate all lanes\nAge - 25\nRank - Bronze 4\nChampion Pool - Teemo\nTime Zone - Mountain\nAnything you should know: Would be willing to tryout for the shot caller/co-captain.
