I looked it up and they said it was because people wouldn&#039;t be able to see the fire ball coming at them. I played against the Master Arcanist Ziggs skin and OMG half his crap was a different color and his slow bombs are almost unrecognizable from the orignials. If you want to make that argument with Ahri it is not fair that Ziggs skin fully changed and hers didnt. Her blue ball should be changed to the orange color of the rest of her skin. \r\nPlease RIOT!","replies":[{"poster":"Academy Kayn","date":"2015-05-10T02:27:40.849+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"The lack of a color change on the ball is due to the fact that if you are facing against an enemy Ahri, as an Ahri, that it would be hard to distinguish whose balls are whose. \n\nZiggs bombs will always be a distinction since they have little QoL effects on them that, like the minefield, that shows you where you need to step to be hit. Also direction. \n\nJayce has a similar problem with his Warpgate, where it is blue despite his theme being red on Forsaken Jayce, mainly because an Enemy Jayce's Warpgate is red, so making an allies Jayce warpgate red, would render it confusing of whose is whose.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-05-10T17:58:39.939+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":4,"body":"It's not a distinguisher between enemy and ally, but rather so that both parties know if she has her passive up or not.

In a fight, it's important for both Ahri, and the enemy fighting her to know if they can get away/secure the kill. \n\nThis is such a weak reasoning and has always been. \n\n* No Ahri will EVER look at the color of her orb to determine if her passive is ready...\n* If you play against her, 95% of the time Ahri will not have it primed and you will need to watch her buffs anyway. The passive is used for lane sustain, not for making any clutch plays. If you aren't able to track her stacks you aren't able to play correctly against her anyway, indicator or not.\n* Even if we ignore the above there would be no problem whatsoever recoloring the orb as long as it stays green for the passive, all it needs is the new color to have a decent contrast to green\n* The same goes for the Charm btw, it's easily possible to recolor it as long as you keep the iconic part of the spell, which is the sound effect.\n\nI don't know who exactly makes these judgement calls at Riot, but as an Ahri main, I seriously start to question them. I don't believe someone with a proper understanding of how Ahri works in the game would hold onto any part of your reasoning...","replies":[]},{"poster":"ScottyRawr","date":"2015-05-12T11:29:16.682+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot KateyKhaos,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=t4hHh1Zk,comment-id=00010001,timestamp=2015-05-10T17:58:39.939+0000)\n>\n> It's not a distinguisher between enemy and ally, but rather so that both parties know if she has her passive up or not.

I honestly and respectfully disagree with that reasoning. :S I don't get the point that if the passive is ready and it turns back to Green for it, what's the big deal...?","replies":[]},{"poster":"llamasx","date":"2015-05-10T19:33:54.627+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I was about to say... if it were for distinguishing enemy from ally then it would be silly.  \n\nThat said, for someone like ahri why not at least change the base q orb color.  Green can be retained for her passive and that'd be clear enough.  \n\nThe things i actually have the most difficulty with for clarity are things that can't be really changed.  Sometimes I dodge skillshots on reflex, even if the only champ throwing that skillshot is on my team.  I always hesitate for a microsecond before crossing Zigg's minefields.  Even though it's red or green, ziggs/panth ults always make me flinch for a second when I see them, and things like that.  The \"arriving\" ping does help a lot for some of the global ults though.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Elphrihaim","date":"2015-05-10T23:45:54.423+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Light24o1,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=t4hHh1Zk,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-05-10T02:27:40.849+0000)\n>\n> The lack of a color change on the ball is due to the fact that if you are facing against an enemy Ahri, as an Ahri, that it would be hard to distinguish whose balls are whose. \n\nNot really.\n\nHonestly, super honestly, not really. \n\nIt's pathetically easy to tell which orb belongs to which team because of motion.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zeref","date":"2015-05-10T13:07:18.599+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"In what scenario would you ever need to distinguish who's orb is whose?

Maybe a chroma rather than changing the skin up like that so it can please two audiences, rito? Also: its been said way too much, the ball needs to remain that way to show if Ahri's passive is up.","replies":[]}]}
