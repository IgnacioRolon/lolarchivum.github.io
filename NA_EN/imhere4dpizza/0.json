The amount of games you are shielded for depends on being promoted to another division or tier per the [ranked play faq](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204010760-Ranked-Play-FAQ).  If something like that were to change, I imagine it would be through an announceent and not solely a supmport article update.
