They are not available in my country - Czech Republic. But if I were to buy one in Germany or Austria and to use it in the Czech Republic, would it work? I can't see any reason why it shouldn't, but I want to be safe. I play on EUNE, if that is somehow relevant :)\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nEmily","replies":[{"poster":"Emily Part","date":"2017-05-28T09:32:21.545+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello!\n\nThank you for the reply! Love the name! :)\n\nMy actual motive is that I have some family in Germany as well as some Euro that I saved over the years. I was hoping prepaid cards might work as a gift option and a way to spend money that I have not much chance to spend, since in the Czech Republic we still have Czech Crowns.\n\nAlso, prepaid cards would work as great opportunity to get a gift from the family here in CZ. Our shops sell Steam cards and PlayStation cards, but sadly not RP cards. You can't very well ask a family member to wire you a transfer as a birthday present, that's just awkward. You mentioned that Czech Republic should have prepaid cards available for purchase, but I searched and didn't find any info concerning that. Would if be possible to send me a link, please?\n\nOne last question, similar to the very first one - would a prepaid card from Slovakia or Poland work then, if I could get my hands on one? (Not sure they even have them, even if the first link you have send says they should, as well as the Czech Republic.)\n\nAnyway, I have bothered you long enough. Thank you so much for your time!\n\nBest regards,\nEmily","replies":[]},{"poster":"Son of Ornn","date":"2017-05-28T01:41:45.617+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sadly that wouldn't work! ;_;\n\nBecause you play on EUNE, you can't use cards purchased from Austria or Germany since both of those regions are tied to EUW, and RP cards can't be transferred between servers. That being said, Czech Republic should have prepaid cards available for purchase, along with some other payment methods on the list we have [** over here**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/203701590).\n\nIf you're having a hard time finding prepaid cards for sale anywhere, you could always try one of the other options. I'd suggest Paysafe myself since it's really reliable, but if you have more questions you should definitely consider ticketing our Billing team [**right here**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new ). They have even more info! :)","replies":[]}]}
