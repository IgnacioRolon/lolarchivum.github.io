It makes his single 575 range engage (shorter range than Ahri's Q and charm) a linear dash that makes it easy to CC him because he'll always dash in a line to your direction, making lux binds and ahri charms super easy to land.\n\nI can't believe you're even comparing Ahri to him when Ahri is a hard counter of talon just like Lux, Xerath, and Velkoz. Any mage with a linear CC counters him since his Q is his only engage, he's squishy, and being easy to kite means he loses hard after being peeled off his Q.","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2020-02-01T00:56:00.666+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Crescent Dusk,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=gNMUosVW,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2020-02-01T00:48:16.037+0000)\n>\n> You do realize the targeted Q makes him weaker, right?
