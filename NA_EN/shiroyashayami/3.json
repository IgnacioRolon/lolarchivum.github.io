Riot, just let us know that he used E on minions. I want an indicator, because without information on which minion he used his E, it is difficult to plan any outplay on him. Literally, the best way to play against him right now is taking a champion that cannot be blocked by windwall, melee champion. This one, simple, visual change would actually make it possible to outplay him with other champions. Even TF would stand a chance, not really, but would be easier for him to survive.","replies":[{"poster":"abusive duo","date":"2019-05-18T20:20:05.430+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Then they should also show an indicator for when cho r can kill you, pyke r threshold, urgot r threshold, and all the other information only the person playing the champ gets. I just don't see how this is a big issue for yasuo considering he's just in a good state rn where that change doesn't need to be made.","replies":[{"poster":"Shiroyashayami","date":"2019-05-19T11:21:57.118+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe because he is anoying to play against to a point that his banrate is 56%. It would make it lower.","replies":[{"poster":"abusive duo","date":"2019-05-19T15:48:08.712+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And his winrate is 47-48%~.

But nothing too drastic just so he feels like \"yasuo\" and not like a whole new champ. But overall I get he's annoying to fight (like a lot of other champs in the game) but from a balance perspective I think he's fine right now.","replies":[{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2019-05-19T23:21:04.012+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah it's just an exceptionally frustrating thing to play against.  Nobody likes doing nothing, and that's what wind wall forces you to do, nothing.\n\nIt's similar to counterspells in Magic: The Gathering.
