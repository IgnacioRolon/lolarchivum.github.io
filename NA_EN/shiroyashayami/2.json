There aren't many AP jng champions tho. It would benefit the role more if she was AP or adaptive. If you have any doubt, you can count ad jng champions and ap jng champions yourself. I won't tell you that you have to believe me but I will ask about your preferences (changing her damage output from ad damage to ap or adaptive should be an easy task for a HUGE company like Riot and even for a really small indie company, there isn't much coding needed to change it).

Also her abilities are good for ganks and for clearing jungle camps but not for killing minions. You literally said yourself all the reasons why she cannot be a laner. Even if she is pushed to be a laner, she will end up in jungle.

The thing you say are her supposed strong points in jungle only further valuate her weakness. She relies heavily on mobility and setup and combined with ranged CC, it means she needs to get ahead FAR if she ever jungles. Bad clear means slow jungle progress which means slacking ganks. Lack of sustain means you need to back a lot which means slow clear which means slacking ganks, again.\n\nPoint is, if she can't clear the jungle she's not good in it because she is going to fall behind on ganking so much you might as well AFK duel gromp for 10 minutes in.\n\nJunglers that can't clear are bad junglers. Period.","replies":[{"poster":"Shiroyashayami","date":"2019-06-10T03:18:49.296+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"> Junglers that can't clear are bad junglers\n\nIn this meta? Not before the nerfs? I mean, we literally don't even farm. And I don't think that her clear is worse than Shaco's. She will get a tiamat as well and be ok. Or maybe she will just need a jng item. Who knows. I can't see her being worse than Katarina jungle and I had perfect cs with her. Period. Also sustain ... like, many junglers don't have that and relay on jng item and runes for that.

Didn't you play for a long time? I did as well. They are almost never right about their champions and then they push them to the position that they want them to be in. She will be a jungler. Then they will try to push her top lane. Don't know if that will work, but they do it everytime with every champion. Just look at her Q. Its a fucking aoe. Her E can get her through walls to another camp. Her w can be utilized better in jungle. Her R is generic but still useful for ganks. Her ganks are easy to pull off. The only thing to watch for is her clear, which can be polished. I mean, i can pull off Katarina jungle, so why not her. I can win with Anivia jng in platinum, first try. Qiyana's abilities look so fun for jungle, that I can't even see her not being there.","replies":[{"poster":"Galiö","date":"2019-06-10T03:31:54.268+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"So like... talon is a jungler too then right?","replies":[{"poster":"Shiroyashayami","date":"2019-06-10T03:39:19.818+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"He was played in jungle.
