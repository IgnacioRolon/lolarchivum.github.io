And I probably wouldn't get so pissed about Fiora if her passive didn't function as a free RNG zoning tool that forces me to back off and reset it if the RNG is bad. Combined with her insane MS, healing, and true damage it makes for a truly shit toplane experience, not that Riot cares. They've made it abundantly clear that they don't give a shit about top, hence the amount of people leaving the lane and/or quitting the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"kingDeDeDarius","date":"2019-02-08T18:36:57.572+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Maybe the design is bad then.
