It's weird... Teemo's E, Varus's W, and even Kog's W don't. They're considered 'On-Hit Effects'.

(From http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Ezreal) \"ACTIVE: Ezreal fires a bolt of energy in a line that will deal physical damage and apply on-hit effects to the first enemy it hits. If it strikes an enemy unit, all of Ezreal's cooldowns will be reduced by 1 second.\" The super difference here is that his 'q' applies on-hit effects. Not on-spell. It's a big difference. If you wanna know what Luden's Echo procs with. Go to http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/ and find a champion you are curious that Luden's will proc off of. Such as let's say... Gang Plank. http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Gangplank now if you scroll down to his 'q' and hit \"detail\" IF YOU CANT FIND THAT IT PROCS SPELL VAMP IT WILL NOT PROC LUDEN'S ECHO. Any ability that procs spell vamp will proc Luden's Echo. I.E.: Ezreal's 'W''E''R' All will proc it. Plus if you are going AP Ezreal you should be maxing your 'W' then 'E' first anyways.","replies":[]}]}
