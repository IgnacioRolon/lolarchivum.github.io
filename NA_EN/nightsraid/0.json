Iv'e only been playing League of Legends for about a year and a few months and, after placing B5 in season 6, have decide to take my ranked more serious. I, of course, placed B5 in placements this year, but have taken a notice of 3v3 ranked and 5v5 ranked flex. Being new to 3v3 (I've been able to climb to B3 so far with a decent W/L ratio) and would love some tips or advice on how the 3v3 game typically works, things a new player wouldn't know perhaps? I currently play top or bottom in 3v3 using mainly {{champion:103}}  and a little bit of {{champion:17}} I run {{summoner:4}} and {{summoner:14}} (or {{summoner:4}}  {{summoner:7}} ) I understand that tanks are needed for peel, but can squishies be viable in higher elo? (I plan to reach at least gold ranking in 3v3 so I can pick up those end of season rewards) Thank you in advance (I apologize if this is in the wrong board, this is my first post)","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-23T23:47:04.665+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm glad to hear you've been making progress in your ranked play! :)\n\nSince you're looking to discuss gameplay, I recommend reposting this to our [**Gameplay Boards**](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance), where other players will have more visibility of this and be able to contribute to the conversation!\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[{"poster":"NightsRAID","date":"2017-02-24T06:10:55.238+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you :) and my bad >////< I'll fix that","replies":[]}]}]}
