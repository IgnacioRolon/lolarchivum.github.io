If I&#039;m 22/3 and still losing a game are you honestly saying I deserve to be punished when I say What the f*** are you doing to the 1/12 jungle? As someone who has played sports at a professional level I can tell you you&#039;re fighting a losing battle by doing this. I&#039;ve never seen a team that doesn&#039;t get annoyed at some tipping point, and you know what, that release of anger through words (even yelling) is healthy. \r\n\r\nIn my opinion this punishment only serves to tilt an already tilted player more. And it also is a system under the assumption that there are just these &quot;toxic players&quot; that need to be removed. Guess what? Everyone playing this game is toxic at some point and to some degree. At what point does RIOT as a company accept that toxicity is a result of players having frustrating experiences while playing. Why do you as a company choose to see &quot;toxic behavior&quot; and not people crying out for something better.\r\n\r\nTLDR: RIOT should stop focusing on punishing its playerbase and start focusing on improving the aspects of the game the playerbase has been waiting for.","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2018-03-23T01:26:49.795+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey mnstryvii, since this is an inappropriate board for this discussion and you've already reposted it over in the correct sub-board of [Player Behavior](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation), I'm locking this post now.

Riot doesnt want Toxicity in the game of any sort... Especially the worse cases of it where people say some pretty bad stuff .. it doesnt matter who you are.. if your toxic you should get banned...  even if i get angry and yell at someone i have NEVER been banned .. well i think i had 1 small chat restriction when i first started in season 3... Punishing people is needed... its like Riot is the parent and we are their children..  and now to pull that into perspective... in the past Children who are spanked and punished.. Generally Behave.. compared to now a days where children are hardly punished  for doing something wrong... you can apply that to riots standards... think if they wouldnt punish players who act like that how much worse the game will be.. after a few punishments the player generally learns not to act out like that..... *heck i know when i was younger i got punished hardcore by someone who use to watch me, not fun getting beaten to where you cant sit down*","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sp33d Zer0","date":"2018-03-23T01:12:59.698+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean I've been playing since s2 and never even had a chat restriction.
