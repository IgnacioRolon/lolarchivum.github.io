I'm consistently losing connectivity in my client only during champ select or when simply trying to navigate the store. It disconnects me from chat for a moment and then says that I have no connection whatsoever. This is untrue because at the same time I was watching streams or playing YouTube videos to wait out queues and whatnot. My biggest issue here is that this did not begin to happen until after I updated with the most recent patch, therefore causing the aforementioned issues. \r\n\r\nAside from there being the random disconnects, which forced me to accidentally dodge twice in the last three games I've played, there doesn't seem to be a set interval for when I lose connection in the client. It can be three minutes before I lose connection or i could be losing connection ever thirty seconds.\r\n\r\nAnother factor that may be under review is the fact that my house has recently just gotten a new modem/router from Xfinity, but the modem/router has been here for almost half a month, and the issue didn't start until i updated this patch. I've used the Hextech Repair Tool several times in order to repatch the client and twice did a full reinstall of the client. I even went back to the Legacy client to see if it was just the LCU, but both of them happened to do the same thing.\r\n\r\nI am now at a loss of what to do and am looking towards anyone here on the boards and Rioters for help in this situation. I just want to comfortably queue up for ranked without the fear of a sudden 5 second disconnect ever thirty seconds or so. Please and thank you.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-04-07T17:12:09.668+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even though your net works fine elsewhere, you can still have problems reaching specific services.  In this case, it sounds like you've got an unstable connection that's disconnecting left and right with champion select, the store, and whatever else.  Since you have the HRT, make sure that you've auto-configured your firewall settings incase anything might be causing hiccups, and I'd advise the same with any antivirus you're running.  You should also go over every step of the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to rule out possibilities.  Once done, test it in a custom game and let me know the results.","replies":[{"poster":"Tirja","date":"2017-04-07T20:18:52.488+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"After attempting everything you suggested, the client still randomly disconnects and I can't even set up the custom game because of this. In contrast, my in game ping is always around 20-30 and I do not disconnect while in game, it's just the client that keeps doing it. I am barely unable to start or get through champion select at this rate.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-04-07T20:21:34.550+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"These features you're using through the client, like champion select, are different services that your network is trying to switch between.
