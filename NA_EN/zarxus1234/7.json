This was more of a problem with matchmaking and premades than it was with a specific champion.\nwhat you should try to take from this rather than QQ about how unfair and unbalanced the game is, is learn what he did right in that game that made him capable of doing what he did, and try to improve yourself. \nSee how he had 275 cs in a 35 minute game, while the highest on your team was over 100 less than that? CS is important. Put more focus on it.","replies":[{"poster":"zarxus1234","date":"2016-09-07T04:58:53.570+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"So just out of curiosity, when i was an 11 kill karthus and died to a 0 kill fiddle while be up 4 levels and over 100 cs  i guess that matters if you only pick certain champs.","replies":[{"poster":"Dynikus","date":"2016-09-07T05:02:24.485+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"if you couldn't 1v1 someone when you had 4 levels and a 5k+ gold lead on them, that's a problem with you, not champion balance.","replies":[{"poster":"zarxus1234","date":"2016-09-07T05:06:31.449+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"So what did i do wrong... enlighten me...  we ran into each other, i hit both q's before his ult went off...","replies":[{"poster":"VoidStaresBack","date":"2016-09-07T07:07:28.358+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Karthus's damage output can be pretty heavily neutered by fiddlesticks because of the amount of CC Fiddles has, and his ult does some pretty good damage to you too (and I think he can remain outside of your e's range while still nailing you with the edge of his ult).  1 v 1 battles are a terrible way of determining champion balance.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gary B Enkelis","date":"2016-09-07T05:09:24.907+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"We'll need a replay or more information.

DotA.\nWhich has more extremes in power levels and direct counter picks and such.\n\nNot having these things makes the game fun, but it also means you have a lot less design space to work with. \nWithout things like counter picks, at least not counter picks that are stronger than just picking the current OP champ.\nYou also can't just build items to make up for champion weakneses so much (the items are the most important thing in DotA)\n\nSo with a small design space and without the option for players to counter pick strong champions or build items to counter them they are stuck with a very difficult balance problem.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DunkinNoobs","date":"2016-09-07T06:09:54.566+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I remember back when I was low enough elo that I could 1v5 with Yasuo.
