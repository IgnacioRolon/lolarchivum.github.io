Shaco is designed to burst. If shaco doesnt have the damage to 100-0 his target instantly then he usually loses the fight.\n\nWarwick is all about slapping you down for a while. So it would make sense that he is better at fighting than a shaco. Not to mention built in lifesteal means he is designed for drawn out fights.\n\nSo even if the warwick is behind, if the Urgot hasnt built in a way that he kills warwick quickly, warwick will most likely just out sustain the damage and kill him.\n\nThey key to kill warwick is burst. All sustain champs like him win extended fights, as that is their design purpose, but they give up burst.\n\nWarwick has 1 damage ability outside of his ult. He literally just slaps you and occasionally chomps you. This means he has no burst, But Due to innate lifesteal and Q healing he is the king of extended brawls.","replies":[{"poster":"Kai Guy","date":"2017-11-08T03:28:12.391+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Op wont hear logic. Pointing out that he will struggle with some champions as a shaco 1 trick does not get across, explaining that if he has only 1 point in E and 3 points in Q means he has terrible damage, especial with out items to pump his passive or autos up. So his level 5 shaco is doing pretty much same damage as he did at level 3, that his kit requires him to be in range for WW Q or autos. \n\nA quick glance at time line shows that, WW killed urgot at 28min, Shaco was not 11 kills till after 20. Shaco tried and failed to kill trist at 28min.  \n\nOp wont accept the inherent struggles in shacos kit, he has a really weak mid game until his items kick his power back up. He wins 50%+ of his games but makes a new thread after most losses recently and I cant fathom why.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Tenth Leper","date":"2017-11-08T03:15:46.637+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How much more SPENT gold did you have than the adc in question?","replies":[]},{"poster":"SwiftKitten88","date":"2017-11-08T00:12:06.180+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you know this going to to take a video if your going to get anyone to call anything but bullshit...\n\ni mean i don't doubt a ADC can kill a shaco in like  2-3 autos, adc are broken..\n\ni doubt that that shaco played that correctly","replies":[]}]}
