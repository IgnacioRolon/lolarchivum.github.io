Hands down the most difficult champion to play in league of legends. He has no winning lane, gets shit on in every trade pre 4 items. His late game is average.\r\n\r\nThe most important thing though is if you win a game as twitch. It shows that you are such a better player than your counterpart you would have steam rolled the game with any other adc. \r\n\r\nTwitch should be able to 1v5 easily late game in his current state. \r\n\r\nLong story short if you win a game as twitch you would have won the game as any other adc which makes in fact playing this champion useless.","replies":[]}
