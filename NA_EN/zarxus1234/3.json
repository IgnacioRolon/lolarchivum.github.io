OR you are creating a smurf in which case the system recognized you as a smurf and is now putting you against other smurfs (the pre 30s) and others from your level (silvers and golds).","replies":[]},{"poster":"CerealBoxOfDoom","date":"2016-06-22T17:52:07.145+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=zarxus1234,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Twe2o7Os,comment-id=,timestamp=2016-06-22T05:37:23.928+0000)\n>\n> How can you as a mutli million dollar company have a match making system that is such shit. \n> \n> For 5 straight games, its been my team (with 3 or more sub level 30s) against an enemy team with all 30s (including plat diamond and gold players?)\n> \n> Im begging you what do i have to do to play a game that isnt over by the 5 minute mark?\n> \n> I just want to play your fucking game thats all.  \n> \n> like come on.
