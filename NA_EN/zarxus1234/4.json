I should have stood in the bot lane bush. I should have known that my bot lane was going to die at level 1. \n\nTheir jungler started 1-2-0 last game. I was 3-0-3.

One person cant carry a game 9/10 times. Its 5v5. I dont understand why you think because your positive you should be winning. \nYOUR KDA DOES NOT MATTER IF YOURE NOT WINNING GAMES. \nIt is not indicative as to how youre actually doing. I could probably watch your replays and tell you what youre doing wrong but beyond that I dont know. Your stats do not matter unless youre winning. \nI play leona a lot and I die a lot on her but I win games because I know when to die for the teamfight win. \nIf youre getting ahead until the enemies are scaling into their strengths and at that point just being too scared to fight because you dont want to ruin your KDA, thats one example of why KDA doesnt matter. People do this.\nTake this as an example. youre 8/4/8 at the end of a game. Thirty minutes in you could have been 8/0/8, then you get caught and die. Youre dead for 30+ seconds because timers scale with game time. Enemy team takes a baron/dragon/tower from the 4v5 advantage. You then die 3 more times and the enemy team just abuses the advantage they have. Situations like this are why KDA really ddoesnt mean shit without some insight as to when you got kills/died. \nIve started games where I die twice in the first 5 minutes. This doesnt matter as much as dieng late because im dead for like a total of 40 seconds. This is why its so dumb to get tilted from early deaths in low ELO. The enemy most likely doesnt know how to push the early advantage and its way too easy to get back inn the game.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"zarxus1234","date":"2017-09-12T14:01:19.146+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RhaastMasterRace,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=z7dEoKUj,comment-id=00000000000100000000,timestamp=2017-09-12T13:55:41.216+0000)\n>\n> If you&#x27;re that fed as shaco and you can&#x27;t impact lanes, it&#x27;s YOUR fault for soaking up all that gold and xp and not using it.
