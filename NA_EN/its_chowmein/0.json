People who have spend a lot of money or time deserve to have some exclusive thing to them similar to how championship riven works, but to a low extent and when I mean a low extent I mean the prestige border. The prestige border should work like how most borders work as in you got the skin when it came out at the time. Look at project and star guardian they have borders too but you literally cant get them anymore. I contacted riot support and all the gave me was they are connected because the skin is hard to get but thats how its suppose to be already because its a prestige skin. But community hear me out on this Im sure people who actually put in the time to get the skin want some exclusive thing to separate them from people who randomly got the skin for much less money and effort. So please lets convince riot to change it because I find its lowkey annoying when someone gets it from the chest and then they have the same exact thing as you and they did nothing rly. Thanks for reading guys.","replies":[{"poster":"Cool Boogie","date":"2019-03-13T06:12:22.987+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"Personally I would love to have the option to get rid of the border.
