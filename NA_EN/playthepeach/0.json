Even if someone has not connected, it's a good idea to play the game normally in the event they reconnect. If everyone is AFK waiting for a remake when someone reconnects before a remake becomes available, it will leave the entire team behind and provide a rough start to the match.\n\nI hope this clarifies the intention of the system a bit more. Let me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zombiemaster","date":"2016-09-30T21:33:51.917+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When a game is remade, it's not just the initial leaver who gets punished. Anyone who is flagged as AFK will receive the \"leaver penalty,\" and certain behaviors like standing in base will flag you as AFK even if you don't physically disconnect from the game. If someone leaves, it's important to continue playing the game as normal, otherwise you will likely be flagged as AFK and receive the leaver penalty.\n\nFor more information about the /remake system, you can read this guide here:\n\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/208754686--Remake-FAQ","replies":[]}]}
