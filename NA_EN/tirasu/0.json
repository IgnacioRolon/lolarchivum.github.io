I like this, and I know these skins are a bit on the... weaker side.. but they are still Legendary skins, and priced at such. I could have sworn that y'all said the legendary+ skins are price protected, and other than an initial sale on they upon release, they will never have their prices reduced. Its kinda a slap in the face to those that did buy they all full price and was assured that it will never be on sale. I remember the last time you had legendary skins prices reduced, you refunded those that had bought them the reduced rp. While I don't personally own any of those skins, I do own a few of the legendary skins, and I know I'd be pissed if I saw a skin i was told would never be on sale now on sale -.-","replies":[{"poster":"Mansana","date":"2014-08-12T10:06:03.928+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You know they do the Legacy skin sales every (if not twice) a year; (once possibly during the summer and) once most surely during the winter holidays. They have done this multiple times before and have occasional days where the skins price is on sale for half off (Especially on December). I'm pretty sure everyone who had the skins prior to the sales had received rp as compensation. This happened with the return of harrowing skins and winter skins as well. I don't see why this is a big issue. Is there something you would like to clarify? because this issue has been resolved and has been stated like 10 months ago.","replies":[{"poster":"Tirasu","date":"2014-08-12T10:49:57.379+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, I'm not talking about the legacy skins in general. I'm talking about the Legendary skins that are now Legacy. I don't recall those being on sell during those periods of time. If they were, I didn't notice because I haven't been buying skins in quite a while. This one just happened to be happening right when I'll have money, so I plan on getting a couple. I'm just curious as to why those particular skins are being put on sale, even for one day, when they are classified as Legendary. I remember reading something from Riot in the past saying \"Legendary+ skins won't ever be put on sale,\" and when they reduced the price or other Legendary skins, those that already had them got a small refund for the the amount reduced. That's my point. I've already said I don't own those skins. The other legacy skins I don't have any issues with, only the Legendary ones.","replies":[{"poster":"Mansana","date":"2014-08-12T11:19:00.421+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Trust me they have been on sale before. And Yes you are correct, Legendaries are price protected but I think this is bypassed mainly because it applies to only current legendary skins possibly. I still don't understand what the issue is if those who owned them before have been compensated. People are getting more value out of the rp that they purchased especially since these skins by some people's standards aren't worth legendary status in today's system. Those who have been compensated should feel happy for others getting the skins... (I hardly see them anyways.) Think of it as an antique collecting.","replies":[{"poster":"Tirasu","date":"2014-08-12T11:52:40.120+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There really wasn't any issues. Just something I had noticed, and found it odd. I didn't know that they had gone on sale before, rather, never really paid attention to them since spending money on skins wasn't something I could do at the time.

Again, I actually don't any of those, but they are/were considered Legendary, and from what i can recall, Y'all said legendaries don't go on sale or have price reductions, except for initial release. I love the sale, don't get me wrong, but that's just the one thing that caught my eye, and i know if i owned them, and they went on sale after being told they wouldn't, I'd be fairly upset.\n\nI do realize that these particular legendaries are inferior to what are out now, but they are/were classified as legendaries, unless I'm mistaken.","replies":[{"poster":"TerraRising","date":"2014-08-12T13:13:29.165+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Sometime in 2012 Magnificent Twisted Fate, Firefighter Tristana and Baron Corki were placed in the Legacy Vault (along with Annie in Wonderland and Alien Invader Heimerdinger).  They were put in the Legacy Vault for a number of listed (and unlisted) reasons, including not actually qualifying as \"Legendary\" according to Riot's new standards and a (frankly) lazy art team who didn't want to take the time to actually MAKE those skins \"Legendary.\"\n\nIn fact, MTF had a very long and popular thread that ran for years before Riot said *\"Nope, not gonna upgrade that skin!\"*  :P\n\nThen, during a later Legacy Vault sale, the skins were announced as being on sale for 50% off by a Riot employee not familiar with how the General Discussion forum works.  This caused an uproar, as you could imagine.\n\n***\"Rito broke promise, must smash!\"***\n\nSo, Riot quickly offered anyone who owned any of the Legendary skins before they were put in the vault the 50% difference.\n\nIt wouldn't be the only time Rito messed with Legendary skins, however.  Astronaut Teemo, Lion Dance Kogâ€™Maw and Piltover Customs Blitzcrank were also dropped in price.\n\nSeems a bit weird, however, since skins like Gentleman Cho'Gath (which is in SERIOUS need of a VU) still counts as \"Legendary\" when it's in the same boat as the other ones who aren't.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Linna Excel","date":"2014-08-13T15:51:56.561+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, it was the really expensive skins they didn't do price reductions on.
