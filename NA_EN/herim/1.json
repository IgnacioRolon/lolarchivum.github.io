There is rarely anyone here who sais the opposite except for me and a few others but every time I make a thread about it or someone else has a problem with this type of behavior, they&#039;re shot down because you got literally almost everyone on boards, reddit and in the game saying it&#039;s ok only because it&#039;s normals or aram. So, I&#039;ll join them since apparently it&#039;s unbannable and nobody cares :)\r\n\r\nYou don&#039;t want this to happen? Try to change the mentality of these players because obviously nobody bothers to listen to the ones who want to enjoy normals without running into a toxic troll or an int feeder. They get downvoted and flamed.","replies":[{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2016-10-03T21:12:38.362+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Occasionally people try to use that \"it was just a normals game\" when defending their behavior here in the pb&m boards. It doesn't work, and I haven't ever seen anyone support that stance.\n\nJust report them after the game for what they are doing and they will be banned if their behavior continues.","replies":[{"poster":"LordGeovanni","date":"2016-10-04T01:56:05.030+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I see it all the time and people defend them too not spefically the people who troll talkigna bout it but the ones who complain about it often get told its only normals who cares. You cant use normals to pratice since no one takes it seriously but you cant practice is ranked because it can ruin other people games and your own win rate and rank. Its an oxymoron and I really believe Riot should publicly speak on it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"elduris","date":"2016-10-03T22:18:04.303+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Literally nobody is saying this is ok.

Then once you are permabanned come post about it on these forums so people can bitch about how toxic you are! Then make another account, waste MORE MONEY (WHOO MORE MONEY WE DID IT RITO WE GOT THEM TO PAY US MONEYS) which is the only thing riot cares about, and then get banned again FOR NO REASON LOL. Then post about it again, and guess what same people same bullshit ;) Just uninstall. its the only thing that will save you from this horse shit.","replies":[]}]}
