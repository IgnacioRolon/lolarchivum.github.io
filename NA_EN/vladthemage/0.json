Also with that update you completely broke Kalista which wasn&#039;t in a great spot. Could you revert that or at least change it a little?","replies":[{"poster":"the weeaboo","date":"2016-10-14T20:46:43.976+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have been forced to use the Attack Move command which annoys me because the only key I have available for attack move is MB3 which is loud and clunky.
