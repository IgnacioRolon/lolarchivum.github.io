I feel like annie Q-W-R is easy to pull and so is Leblanc&#039;s Q-R-W, that burst you. I played a matchup where I was first pick Orianna into Leblanc and I had nothing to do as she simply bursted me. Also am I the only one that feels Annie rework is a sort of buff(talking about ult)?","replies":[{"poster":"Michael Sykes","date":"2016-07-08T10:37:01.816+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually the lane Orianna vs LeBlanc is pretty good for Orianna - except you are playing Ori not very frequently and your opponent is a LeBlanc main.\n\nAdditionally, you are able to protect your ADC against the LeBlanc - makes the game even harder for her","replies":[{"poster":"VladTheMage","date":"2016-07-08T10:39:39.028+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Still hard lane especially mid-game","replies":[{"poster":"Michael Sykes","date":"2016-07-08T10:44:29.720+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"yep, but trust me, it is not easy for both sides.

You have to be seasoned enough to carry games because she has the LOWEST base health among the assassins, and she has to approach enemies closely to deal damage. She can poof back but she melts away if she is CC'ed during W. Also, because she is bad at farming, so if she loses lane badly it's hard to make a come back. Also she doens' have chance to build pure defensive items like banshee or GA because she is a main burst dealer in her team, and getting zero AP defense items causes lots of deal loss. It's even harder for LB if enemy team has bruiser and tanks(meaning her team failed to win early).\n\nBad LB players are one of the worst frustration; they don't know combo, good item choices, and timing to jump into the enemies. The team ends up having 4 vs 5 fights. For example, I had LB buying Athene and liandry by the 30 minutes mark....we lost that game because she was our main dealer and wwithout someone to burst the enemeis down, we lost very quicky","replies":[]},{"poster":"SnugglePuggle94","date":"2016-07-08T13:38:53.836+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nope.

She used to be more fun to play at support than she is to play mid today. Or at least give her some other kind of utility. Maybe a delayed silence or something, if you combo two of her abilities. Rather than just giving her insane damage and having a one-button snare, I think it'd be more fun if they gave her different CC options based on landing an ability after another specific ability.","replies":[{"poster":"VladTheMage","date":"2016-07-08T10:49:48.650+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Maybe also nerf her W speed a little?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"PiVoRx","date":"2016-07-08T12:18:07.392+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"LeBitch is a retarded design overall, one shotting champion with 4 dashes/teleports along with invisibility and decoy for safety, how can so packed kit can be called balanced?","replies":[]}]}
