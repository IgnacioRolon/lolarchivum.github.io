I have played mid lane a lot and whenever I play a Mage, after lvl 6 or 11 they fall behind hard to Veigar. Also I agree he has some skillshots but as an ADC what should I do to counter his ult? Buy Zhonya&#039;s? I hate how playing against Veigar turns late game into &quot;Dodge my abilities and get ulted for 100% HP&quot;","replies":[{"poster":"Sasogwa","date":"2016-11-16T11:12:52.201+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Because his damage is unreliable.
