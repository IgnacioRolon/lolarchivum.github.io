URGENT HELP! \r\nLaunching the legacy client simply removes me from the login screen and doesn't launch the old client, now I have 5 games of 5 minute queue times for nothing, I have now also left a lower priority game with a 5 minute queue time so I will most likely have 13-20 minute wait in the lower priority queue because the client has failed to operate. -_-","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-20T05:12:03.270+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It doesn't sound like this was caused by a problem with the client, since you experienced issues with both the Legacy and Beta Client.
