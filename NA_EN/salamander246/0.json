We picked our bans and preview champs, then went into the actual Selection process. Our first pick chose {{champion:222}} , and theirs picked {{champion:81}} . However, the third selection didn't go through and time ran out. I expected to automatically be returned to queue, but instead the client froze when the timer reached zero. Now my four teammates have left, but I am not sure if leaving will lose me any LP, nor were they. Could somebody please remedy the situation if I do?\r\n\r\n-Thank you\r\nSalamander246 (Teammates: Karalina, Enduring, Coco Plebbles, Bigdaddy Takeo)","replies":[{"poster":"MissDestructa","date":"2016-06-14T03:16:33.576+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Help i can't queue up for ranked or normals draft pick. it just puts me on a loading screen and after a few seconds i get returned to the lobby","replies":[{"poster":"Skhadow","date":"2016-06-14T04:55:25.003+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same to me, no queue to draft mode.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"F2ptmVtLMF","date":"2016-06-14T03:05:25.822+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same exact thing happened to me about 2 hours ago and it still won't let me queue.
