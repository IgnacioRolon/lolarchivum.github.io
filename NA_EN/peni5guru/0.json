I am getting this weird like popping and crackling static like noise, or something, the voices in game are all choppy, and then my ping spikes anywhere from 150 - 1000.  I've reloged, restarted, and ran a scan on my computer.  Nothing seems to help.  I've been bouncing back and forth between ranked and ARAM, and it only seems to happen in ranked.. any suggestions? or is / has this happened to anyone else?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-02T19:10:52.310+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unless you have failing hardware, it seems like you're having some big network issues staying connected to the game server.  Connection issues can also cause sounds to play oddly too, so I suggest running through the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to rule out possibilities.  Test it out in a custom game, and let me know the results!","replies":[]}]}
