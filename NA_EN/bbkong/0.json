He went top with me, and then when I went bot to try to help the lane he just followed and went where he would benefit us the least(we were doing horribly because we had {{champion:90}} mid, {{champion:11}} jg, me({{champion:92}} top and it was my first game as her), {{champion:17}} nowhere, {{champion:13}} bot and we were just shuffling lanes around. He also just went invis and sat a lot. Anyway, when he typed the comment in the chat- it was exactly \"is it cause i ruined your game and no matter what you say there is not a god * thing you can do about it\"- I screenshotted it, and I am asking is there any point to sending this, will Riot do anything, and where do I send the image if you think so? I could really care less if this guy gets banned, but I see people complaining about people ruining games, so I thought I'd try at least. Also, I believe the reason we were doing badly was because it was basically 4v5, and they had no jg and some really tanky characters, not our team itself.","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2015-10-22T05:20:57.043+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey BBKong,\n\nFor offenses that occur in game, do your best to use the report systems in the post-game lobby. It makes players' behaviors easier to track and apply punishments to certain players if necessary.","replies":[{"poster":"BBKong","date":"2015-10-22T21:35:04.731+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've heard that before, but I didn't think it would let you put a picture in the report so I wanted to know. I'll probably just keep that screenshot and let this post die, as it's not affecting me. Thanks for the reply anyway.

If I may give some advice as well when it comes to negative players, and it made seem a bit hard to chew. Don't let negative players get to you. Easier said than done, I know, but think of each game as not only a way to team build but to work and hone your skills. I used to get so raged up I would walk away from my computer but I had to realize no matter how negative they were they really had no effect on me up close and in person.\n\n Try to stay positive and remember to report toxic players so we can help Riot curb negativity in and out of game! \n\n\n{{champion:25}} {{summoner:4}} {{item:3157}}","replies":[]}]}
