That still means that you fed the troll, which is a big no-no, resulting in emboldening that player and opening yourself up to punishment by the system. The best reaction is always to simply mute, report, and move on.\n\nWhile I do still think you didn't handle this game well, I apologize for suggesting that you were mis-representing the Shaco's performance. Based on your op.gg page, it looked like a simple bad game that you lost your cool over, but in the video the intent is clear. **I'm sorry, both for my own reaction and for the experience you went through.**\n\nFor what it's worth, you can try a support ticket to argue mitigating circumstances leading to you being baited into a chat restriction. The odds aren't really in your favor, though. Riot's policy, which is certainly imperfect but also difficult to improve on, is that there's no acceptable circumstances for flaming your team, period. Understand that many other players will insist, with as much conviction as you have here, that their bad teammates are \"inting\".

To you, your chat logs are justified by the misbehavior of your teammate. In a perfect worth with an impartial judge expertly analyzing your game, this would probably be true. However, we're putting that decision in the hands of a random Riot employee tasked with looking at these games all day every day, leaving room for error in that individual's interpretation, level of engagement, energy, degree of training, etc. If official Riot policy remains that flaming is never acceptable, your ass is still getting that chat restriction. If there's leniency available when dealing with trolls, then this random intern is not only tasked with evaluating your logs, but *also* the Shaco's behavior, and then making another subjective interpretation of how bad Shaco's behavior was, relative to how bad yours was. I can't imagine any level of consistency or accuracy being maintained in such a system. \n\nIn googling around, I found that about 27 million people played League per day in 2014. I can't find any more recent figures, but if we just punt and half that number, we're still at 13.5 million people per day.

You'd be wise to heed it.\n\nShit's not always fair, and it sucks that you got baited into a chat restriction here, but you haven't yet reached a 14-day ban and the honor hell that comes with it. Learn from your mistakes, whether or not you agree with the reasoning as to *why* they're mistakes, and you'll be fine. Carry on as you've been doing, and you're gonna wind up losing your account next time somebody ints in your game, and that would just be a needless tragedy.","replies":[{"poster":"Killsquad2","date":"2018-02-05T21:21:29.522+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Killsquad2","date":"2018-02-05T21:22:19.723+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"o and if you think thats toxic go read the rules of the forum and then answer the OP question which wasnt \"hey whats your advice on how to not get chat banned\" because thats obviously dont communicate via chat you dumbass.","replies":[{"poster":"HalcyonDweller","date":"2018-02-05T21:49:31.903+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You don't need to avoid using chat in order to not be punished. Lots of people use chat all the time without getting punished. You just need to figure out how they are using it and replicate it.\n\nGenerally, people use chat to communicate strategies and coordinate plays, and sometimes to ask for surrenders when they are not having fun anymore.\n\nThe people who are not punished are the ones who do not do things like start arguments, act passive aggressive, or make insulting insinuations about people. It also helps to not try to force people to do what you want. They are free to make whatever decisions they like, and if they vote no on a surrender it is generally frowned upon to then complain about that vote in chat.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"HalcyonDweller","date":"2018-02-05T21:32:05.860+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You literally asked why you got a 25 game chat restriction for that chat. Not only are you attacking anyone who explains it to you, but you're refusing to converse reasonably about it. It follows naturally to discuss how to avoid such restrictions.\n\nI still bear you no ill will, and I think you'd have a better experience here if you stopped being combative. But you do you.\n\nAlso I don't see why Jo0o's comment would warrant a \"fuck you\" seeing as he didn't insult you in any way.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Timethief49","date":"2018-02-05T17:53:57.403+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Killsquad2: go afk\nKillsquad2: yep\nKillsquad2: 9x on him after\nyou start the game flaming and the rest isnt any better.
