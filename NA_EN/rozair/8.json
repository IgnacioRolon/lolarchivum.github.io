Right now Singed isn't considered good by most people because they don't give him a closer look. (talking silver elo here) People think he does 0 Damage because it's DoT and think he just doesn't bring anything else. \nIf you give him a closer look, and adapt to his playstyle, you'll see he often does as much damage as a carry, is extremely tanky, and his Ult is the most overloaded ability in the game (imo). However combining everything in his kit you get a champ who right now is not OP and not garbage either.\n\nSo he doesn't need the buff, if singed gets ahead right now chances are that if the rest of the game goes even he'll be stompin. He becomes extremely oppressive when ahead. Giving him grounded will make him a lot stronger as a lot of characters who deal well with him are the ones that can kite and harass him (Kayle/Teemo for example). This will lead to people crying about Singed, especially because he does so much better in Solo/duo than 5v5 Teams. And the next thing riot will do is gut him. And if that happens i'll be sad.\n\nSo Singed can use it, he doesn't need it. I'd rather not take the risk of making him oppressive which will probably lead to nerfs to his q or ult more likely than just reverting the grounding. \n\n\non a side note: Riot actually does look out for singed. I only started playing during  preseason 5 and since then there have been a few buffs.\nWhat i can immediatly remember: \n\nHe got MR on level. \nWhich he really needed. Before that i miserably failed at playing him and had given up this buff made me play him again and realize i should just take the lost matches untill i learned him (i figured out my way of playing him is lane singed instead of proxy).\n\nHe got the % health dmg on his fling.\n\nHe got the laugh on his fling\n\nsome fixes and changes to his tickrate.\n\nSo while he isn't very prominent on lcs, patch notes he isn't forgotten and when looking at video's by Dyrus/QT there's quite a bit of high elo singed players. and he's not thrash tier (imo tier 1 (god tier in silver))","replies":[{"poster":"5000000000000000","date":"2016-12-31T23:15:36.562+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I love how you actually included the laugh in your list XD\nthe strongest buff anyone has ever gotten in the history of lol","replies":[{"poster":"Escheton","date":"2016-12-31T23:31:21.286+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=5000000000000000,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=u5susc5x,comment-id=000b0001,timestamp=2016-12-31T23:15:36.562+0000)\n>\n> I love how you actually included the laugh in your list XD\n> the strongest buff anyone has ever gotten in the history of lol\n\nHonestly I felt dirty when it happened.
