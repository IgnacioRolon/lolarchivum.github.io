But there still should be a Harrowing on Halloween, as that is the core of what the Harrowing means to the fanbase. Also, prioritizing Worlds over a favored lore event is not a good idea.

OR if you guys are unwilling to do that then make some altered coop permanent game mode allowed for those who actually enjoy coop vs ai. Such as doom bots. Why these changes have never been implemented or considered baffles me. You guys let dominion left to rot. \n\nLiterally let bots crap all over it and did nothing to keep the hype to it. I literally LOVE dominion and it's by far my favorite game mode but 5min-20min game modes on some days is just too much for somebody like me who works 2 jobs and goes to school. Seriously though. Retire dominion, add it to the list of gamemodes that can return with the other game modes which will use those allocated servers. Simple yet effective change to keep league interesting and give people something to look forward to throughout the month other than random skins that only hype certain people based off of concept or champions people play.

This has been happening since Beta. So has Snowdown Showdown, which is also not going to be coming out at the proper time. Riot said that \"It will happen when we say it happens.\" \n\nI'm not disagreeing with you, I'm just pointing out that this tradition has been around since beta. So it's been 6-7 years now.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SeductiveGrandpa","date":"2015-11-06T01:24:41.298+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Season 6 looks to be something to look forward to as an apology for the missed halloween, at least we got some good lore and now we can have cool harrowing skins at any time of the year, (CHRISTMAS IN JULY GIF) but yeah and about the listening thing:\nI hate saying it because I get destroyed for putting it out there but lets be serious, 9/10 when Rito actually listens to the playerbase on a topic (If this topic doesnt involve simple things like name changes or just little fixes) about balance, things get totally worse than usual. I believe two of the juggernauts had this problem and I know many other changes that have happened because of board outcries have also made things worst on multiple occasions so I could see their lack of listening to the player base. In the end, the boards really on excels on simple changes because the moment anything else comes out (rather than an actual good idea that can be simply implemented ex: recall animations in ARAM) and or providing skin ideas, its terrribleeee for balance and or champion changes. And, i've noticed a lot that people assume everything they say needs to be considered and or put into the game and that rito should follow everything they say, I mean i'm fine with them doing things on their own as they shouldn't feel constricted by the playerbase to always have to do what it wants. \n\n","replies":[{"poster":"Leadpaintchips","date":"2015-11-06T04:06:54.573+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"for how often they have stated that they believe in clarity, they really muddied the waters on this one.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
