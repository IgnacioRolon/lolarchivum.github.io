They need HUGELY increased damage or attack speed against tanks. They are pretty towers past level 9 for almost 40 champions. These champs don't just dive. They tank the tower and kill it without repercussion.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Koalifier","date":"2016-01-08T21:29:19.193+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":2,"body":"I think I just fundamentally disagree that towers should be able to take on mega-tanks.

You don't get to that point where towers become .05 of a champion's worth because the tank is built up and just holds the aggro while your ally gets murdered pretty much retaliation-free.\n\nAs far as it's impacts on tanks would feel, tanks right now already feel too weak especially in the jungle imo, with the much more common Armor Pen stats making life for tanks much harder as early assassins can effectively kill them, at least early. And the fact that they're now efficiently countered by the Last Whisper upgrades late game, which is fine to an extent.\n\nAlso, one reason why people get majorly ticked at the base turrets is because they can't even keep up with an ADC's ability to self heal half the time once late game hits, not to mention tanks.\n\nThe one thing i'd remove from current turret behavior is how they react to items like Sunfire's Cape damage to champions which can draw aggro 'for no reason' and be frustrating.

For example, you have a bunch of examples of tower buffs at the bottom of the post, which I think is the main part you'd want people to look at.  An example post would be something like:\n\n\"Towers don't do enough to prevent early dives, making it too punishing to get behind in lane (<---problem statement/subject of post)\n\nHello! I think that towers need to be upgraded to keep pace with other changes in the game. Mobility, sustain, and damage-avoidance abilities have all increased over the past couple of seasons, which has moved towers toward obsolescence. I'd love to get some input on these ideas for buffing towers:  \"\n\nThen you could just copy-paste your top 5 ideas there.\n\nAs far as my input on your post, I don't really have a lot to say. Personally, I don't think that towers are in a terrible place, so I disagree with the premise that they need to be buffed. Additionally, I think that buffing towers will make for less interesting plays on average, not more. \n\nPulling off a really good tower dive is super satisfying, whereas choking your opponent out of farm by freezing a wave is not very satisfying. Buffing towers creates an incentive for freezing lanes and starving opponents of farm, which further starves players of interesting interactions. Personally, I'd much rather try to survive a tower dive (with a chance of getting a good turnaround if the dive isn't executed well or I make a good play) than sit under tower waiting for a lane to push toward me because my lane opponent is beating me, but too afraid to dive me.\n\nThe former is just more interesting than the latter.

They said so themselves: If Azir, LeBlanc and Ryze ever reach 50% win rate, it's because they are too strong given how powerful their kits are.\n\nBecause a champion's win rate is low, doesn't disqualify them from being a bs champion. Thresh and Lee Sin are highly picked, because they bring 90% of what many champions bring to the table in ***one*** kit. Thresh has the kill potential, the peels, the escape, a shield, powerful slows, innately tanky thanks to his passive and build style, damage, and he's ranged, to top it off. All he's lacking are heals and silences, otherwise he has everything going for him.\n\nSame with Lee Sin. He's a fighter+assassin+tank hybrid that has amazing peel, ganks, self-sustain and shields, extreme mobility, tank busting ultimate with a sick nasty AD ratio, execute built into his Q, a crippling aoe, and has MANY windows of opportunities that he can provide both for himself and his allies. Lee Sin has a ***lot*** going for him.\n\nThe only reason why their win rate would be relatively low, despite being ***very*** frustrating to play against, is that they have a high skill cap.

If people played supports based on how fun they are, we would have a more even distribution because supports, well, *support.* Lots of people are into that. If one does that better (or appears to, like LCS play), people are going to play them more. \n\nHonestly, a lot of people think Thresh should be nerfed because he crowds out other supports, but I'm in the boat that every support should be at his level. Instead of making Thresh the Lee Sin of supports, he ought to be the Renekton bar for supporting.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Rozair","date":"2016-01-08T11:26:05.957+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm surprised that towers haven't changed around players growing in skill like the jungle has.

Again, it kind of goes back to the example of waveclear heavy comps. Stronger towers = buff to waveclear = killing towers is harder = games take longer even when you're already winning.

I'm personally looking at the PBE bugs every day / every other day, depending on what part of the patch cycle we are in. The bigger issue has to do with timing. If you report a bug one or two days before we ship out the latest patch, we're probably not going to fix that bug before the patch because it's not worth the risk of creating a bigger problem. Instead, we'll aim to fix it in the next patch instead, or maybe as a hotfix after we can get more testing.\n\nAs to balance data from the PBE.... it's really tough to say. Having previously worked on a team that did balance-related things, it's extremely difficult to get a good idea of how something will play out on live servers. The PBE really isn't a great place for balance testing, unfortunately. MMR disparity is pretty big in the PBE due to smaller player population, and most players have fewer games played so will not be at their \"true\" MMR. On top of that, some people are focused on testing different things, which might detract from competitive balance feedback. For example, if I'm dead-set on testing out Kindred on PBE, but I really suck at jungling and don't know what I'm doing, my play in the game will make it harder for other players to tell whether Kindred is OP, or I'm just new to jungle.\n\nIMO the most valuable feedback that we can get from players that is related to gameplay is stuff like this thread: feels-type feedback. If you tell a designer \"hey new Skarner sucks he's really weak\" - I can't do a lot with that feedback, as I don't really know _how_ he sucks. Is his damage just too low? Does he lack tankiness? Is his E unsatisfying? The gameplay feedback that designers get from the PBE is really valuable, I've heard many people talk about it and seen Rioters post asking for it on the forums, but there's still not going to be a lot of response to balance related feedback, because too much nuance goes into balance.\n\nThat being said, please don't hesitate to post: \"Hey _______ is OP wtf\" as a topic. We still hear that feedback, there's just not to talk about so most of us probably won't comment XD","replies":[{"poster":"AMYS GRAVE","date":"2016-01-10T07:46:40.831+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"A lot of bugs are found on the PBE, but occasionally things like azir slip through and his release was quite buggy despite PBE feedback to that point. \n\nAs far as balance on the PBE is concerned for every MMR imbalance that happens you get one in the opposite direction, so it changes the sigma not the mu. You may not be able to get perfect balance off of it but i'd be shocked if the signal can't be detected through the noise. \n\nI'm glad you brought up skarner, because when RiotRepertoir was working with him and was all over the boards i remember the feedback being very directed. His zones of power (spires) weren't in the locations he needed to have power because they severely limited his ganking potential, and even when he was in the zones there was enough counterplay to the zones that they didn't feel effective. That was some very usable balance related feedback that could have been used more effectively. If we look at what happened skarner he was weak on the PBE, then was overbuffed at the last second due to this feedback, and he didn't get the time to be tested further. I know nuance isn't the boards strong suit but to RiotRepertoir's credit, the man knows how to start positive and constructive conversations and discounting any balance related feedback doesn't seem fair. I guess it irks me a bit when people blame the PBE _volunteers_ for giving feedback and point to skarner to discredit anything a PBE player has to say about balance.

In addition to everything that you mentioned, he also falls into a class of junglers like Udyr that, when played well, can really dominate, but when played poorly kind of fall flat. Thus his balance also relies heavily on how well players understand how to utilize his kit, as opposed to someone like Vi who will have pretty successful presence on a flatter experience curve. It doesn't mean that only certain players can give balance feedback on him, but it does mean that it takes more games played to get a good feel on how to utilize his kit.\n\nI can't say I followed the PBE feedback on Skarner too carefully, but I do know that Repertoir is super active on the boards (and not just in his mega-post). I hope that the learning we took from that experience wasn't \"don't listen to PBE on balance\" but instead \"don't make big balance changes without time to test them\". In that case, it would've been probably a better call to tell players on the PBE \"We hear you that Skarner feels weak right now, but we won't have time to test new changes before shipping him live. Instead, we're going to prep some buffs for him to hotfix if he's looking really week this patch, but if he looks like he's in an okay place, we'll hold back.\" Hindsight is 20/20, of course, but I think we learned a lot from that experience.\n\nOn the topic of blaming PBE volunteers for bugs/balance..... it's really annoying when that happens. The PBE is a tool, it's super helpful, but it's not going to catch everything. PBE testers prevent major crashes from going live on a regular basis. They catch broken OP/UP champs and items from time to time as well. PBE players also help to catch a lot of graphical bugs on skins. Just like the QA at Riot, it's not really feasible for them to catch every bad bug or OP thing.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"ZT Xperimentor","date":"2016-01-09T16:59:52.381+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd say it was more of a problem from the game growth over time, than the fault of either side. In the early days it was easier to discuss problems both in the live & beta boards, since there was only a 100,000 players; but now that it's in the tens of millions, it's harder to be heard because (I speculate) riot staff haven't grown in a similar scale.
