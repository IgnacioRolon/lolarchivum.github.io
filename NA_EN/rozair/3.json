Ashe should not benefit significantly more than other ADCs from stacking critical damage. The damage formula is to make sure Ashe has similar paper DPS as other ADCs when she has the same items as them. The formula works to make sure Ashe's guarantee crits doesn't overpower the AA damage on other ADCs. \n\nNot every rune is supposed to be good early game.

That's the entire point of her passive. If she just got a straight 1% increase in autoattack damage per 1% crit damage it would be *incredibly* broken.\n\nThe actual formula for Ashe's passive is that she crits for 110 (+ Crit Chance * Crit Damage) % AD","replies":[]},{"poster":"Duke Anax","date":"2015-09-25T19:00:31.000+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"It makes perfect sense, because Ashe's crit chance is converted to base crit damage.\n\nWhile other champs have 100% base critical damage and variable crit chance.

So it would increase the base bonus damage from 10% to 15%. What would increase it's damage to 130% now increases it to 145%.\n\nBasically, getting critical damage as Ashe increases damage like this:\nCrit Damage Bonus from Runes: 10%\nAshe gets 10% critical strike chance.
