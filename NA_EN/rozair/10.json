With losing catalyst and chalice abyssal is really the only option for a mage that just needs to survive, but then you&#x27;re not building mana.  Mages that need both early might need tuning.\n\nThat's also fair, I'm reading over the official notes now and some items that will be good for surviving laning are:\n- Catalyst. Even though Valor's reward is much better you'll be able to sustain with spell casts, and taking poke gives you mana back so that you can heal some of the poke with spell casts. It's a vicious cycle, will probably be a must buy for a lot of champions.\n- Abyssal. Like you mentioned, though it may come down to making the choice, do it rush it or build my negatron cloak to not take as much damage, and then finish Abyssal later.\n- Lost Chapter >> Morellos. Gives mana, a buttload of AP, and restores max mana on lvl up (or assists/kill if morellos)\n- Tear (somewhat). Refunds a percentage of spell costs and increases your pool making it very efficient. Will have to see if it is a good item to get early or if it is too much of a risk.\n\nSome other options you could go is double doran's rings and then build into your core items. 2 dorans should give enough early regen to get you through early game. The other option is going the economy route with picking up FQC which provides gold generation to slingshot you into other items, while providing some mana regen and okay AP.\n\nWill have to see how it plays out, hopefully this helps with figuring out early items for you once the update goes out tomorrow :)","replies":[{"poster":"VentusDragoon","date":"2016-05-05T07:43:15.871+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My only concern is Anivia.
