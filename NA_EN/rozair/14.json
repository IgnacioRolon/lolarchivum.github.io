This will take some defensive power away from Diana and screw her ability to slow a champion down. For instance if garen uses his q to close the distance you can get him on the outer range of dianas e and use it to slow him but he also doesn&#039;t get close enough to actually hit Diana. With this change you will be inadvertently buffing any champion who tries to get in some auto attacks. Another example is hecarim. You can e to slow him down to the place where he may not being able to e you or at least it will deal less damage. For the most part if Diana gets in on a squishy target they are going to flash out anyways. This is more of an overall nerf for Diana than anything else and a situational buff.","replies":[{"poster":"Kubox","date":"2016-08-20T18:52:43.309+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I find that situations where your point is relevant are not as common as situations where the change is better.\n\nLike how many times does Diana go near someone simply to slow them? If anything, if you don't want them on you, you shouldn't have been there to begin with. On the other hand, a stronger pull will always be more useful when jumping on someone, helping her proc her passive more easily.","replies":[{"poster":"Rozair","date":"2016-08-21T10:52:34.418+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You don't have to get close to use it. Only when they are running close to you. For instance tryndamere or garen chasing.

Although if it applied moonlight in her current state she would be broken as hell. Bonus movement speed would also be a good idea but they are increasing the pull distance of her e so it would be pointless because they will be on top of her.","replies":[{"poster":"redfeenix","date":"2016-08-20T15:03:27.223+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeh it's a unique spell and it really sets her apart. I don't think they'll ever change her q or her e.

They all fit her lore really good. If they took the sheild orbs away from Diana it would completely change her playstyle. The only ability they can play with is her e and even that is touchy because they can't give her more damage because then she will be op but I think her e is lackbuster and it could use a non damage aspect to it other than a vacuum with an insanly long cooldown.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Rozair","date":"2016-08-20T15:04:32.829+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They  are increasing the vacuum though that's the issue I have with it.
