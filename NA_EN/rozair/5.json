It sucks when you lose a teamfight because your adc accidentally dodged your bubble while fighting their zed.  \n\nTheir is also the issue of clarity.  Typically things that are coming towards you and is a skillshot are enemy projectiles and should be avoided not intentionally throwing yourself in to.\n\nThis Item could work as a point and click or active in an area around but then its just like locket of solari or like face of the mountain.  The other option is to move the gold generation passive on face to the shield as the stacks are sometimes hard to get rid of but for sake of constancy in gold generation I don't see it happening.\n\nThere is also the question of how its used and how efficient it will be.  Obviously numbers can be changed but the item seems to encourage taking damage over avoiding it.  \n\nFor a stretched comparison Jannas shield gives ad when it still is active.  This promotes trading when you have it on you but also tells you to try to avoid taking as much dmg as possible to avoid losing the extra ad.  If her shield worked the same way (similar way) yours does then it would give more ad the less shield you have, up to when it breaks, creating a kind of dilema for the adc, do I purposely take that brand q to increase my ad (generate gold) or dodge it to ensure I can last longer?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Feel Apathy","date":"2016-06-12T15:36:20.576+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They're going to boost supports after 2 or 3 patches.
