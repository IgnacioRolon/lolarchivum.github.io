Her profile panel says I haven't already earned a chest so i should be able to receive one. I've played 3 games with her where a teammate has earned an S or S- and therefore i should be entitled to a chest. Is it that i need to earn the S myself or am i being a noob? xD","replies":[{"poster":"Zombiemaster","date":"2017-03-03T19:38:55.850+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Were you in a premade party with the teammate? If a teammate gets an S grade, you need to be in a premade party with them in order to earn a chest.","replies":[{"poster":"BloopyLad","date":"2017-03-04T15:49:26.191+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahhhhh - no i wasn't in a premade party. \nIll see if i get a chest that way then.\nThanks guys xD","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-03T19:57:21.709+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm with Zombiemaster on this!  Per the [hextech crafting](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207884233-Hextech-Crafting-Guide) guide, the teammate actually has to be in a premade party with you to be eligible.  Let me know if that clears things up!","replies":[]}]}
