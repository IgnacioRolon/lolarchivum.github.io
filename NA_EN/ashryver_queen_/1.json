Start with the small things, locate the root of the problems. The biggest complaint at the moment is damage, the roles that exploit the damage spike the most are Assassins. I don't want to win my lane so the 0/3 Zed can come bot and still murder me while missing all of his abilities because {{item:3147}} - which, now that I mention it, why the hell does this thing impact control wards? I don't want to waste 75G on a ward to protect myself from the jungler if assassin #145 can just 1shot it and insta-gain 30 gold while I can't punish him for it.","replies":[{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2019-07-19T10:28:28.811+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Brand and Zyra aren't in bot because they can't hang in mid. If that was the case they would be neither mid nor bot.\n\n They are bot because they do something well there that other champs can't so as well, which is keep the opponents from farming with poke over minions.\n\nIf you just don't want them bot drastically cut their mana or mana regen and brand's W and Zyra's E and Q. However, I like the fact that there are more options to play as supports than just enchanters and tanks, even if I don't use them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ahri Baka","date":"2019-07-19T10:08:29.187+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Zyra and Brand going support is because they can't mid lane for many reasons \n\nLux was just kicked out of bot lane tho","replies":[{"poster":"Ashryver Queen ","date":"2019-07-19T10:10:34.836+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Kitsune Kawaii,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=h296kwOK,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2019-07-19T10:08:29.187+0000)\n>\n> Zyra and Brand going support is because they can't mid lane for many reasons \n> \n> Lux was just kicked out of bot lane tho\n\nI don't mind Lux bot, I've never had an issue with her, could be because I've been maining Lux since season 3 though and know how to play around her - but I can understand that she is very frustrating to deal with, yeah.\nAs much as I dislike admitting it, it takes very little effort to output a lot of damage with Lux and that makes me sad - what I love about Lux is that feeling of perfect precision I get when playing her and land 80% of my skillshots in a game.
