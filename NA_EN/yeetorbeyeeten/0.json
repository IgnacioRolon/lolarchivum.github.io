The skin is unlocked and it says owned, but it's still in my loot and won't go away. I've heard it's a rare skin so I don't really want the chance that it could disappear as even though it's unlocked, I still have the option to reroll it or disenchant it. It would probably only disappear if I clicked on one of those but I have upgraded the free Ashe skin when I started playing in April and that disappeared, along with a 3 shard reroll that turned into Viridan Kayle.\r\n\r\nSo my main issue is, why is this permanent/upgraded skin in my loot still and how do I get it out without losing the skin? The person who replied to my topic in miscellaneous said it wasn't supposed to happen and could have been a result of the server issues.","replies":[{"poster":"YeetOrBeYeeten","date":"2016-05-03T01:35:46.062+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just to clarify all the details to get an answer quicker and easier: \n\nI opened a chest, got the Annie skin (only one, not a duplicate)\nI upgraded the skin with ~2100 orange essence\nI received the skin, which is usable for me in game\nI own Annie\nI have restarted my client multiple times since then\nThe skin says Mythic and has a purple gem under it if that makes a difference.\n\nIt remains in my loot even though it was upgraded. I've upgraded 2 other skins including the free one when you make your account, neither did this and other users told me this was not normal for the skin to remain in loot after permanently upgrading.","replies":[{"poster":"Helmight","date":"2016-05-03T23:30:55.509+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sounds like you got Hextech Annie, mate - in which case you need ten or so gems in order to finish crafting it and unlock it permanently.","replies":[{"poster":"Kasakabe","date":"2016-05-05T14:06:25.049+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's wrong.

It has a purple gem underneath. Is it supposed to unlock differently than other skins? That guy^ said you need 10 gems, I don't have any of those. I opened a chest and it said hextech Annie as a skin shard, I then sold the other shards I had for the orange essence (as the skin cost quite a bit for the upgrade) and permanently upgraded it. But it's still in my loot. I can use the skin and have in many games, but the other skins I've unlocked don't stay in my loot so I was just wondering what was up. I'd appreciate any help, and thanks for the quick response! You guys have pretty good support compared to other companies","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-05-04T23:03:02.602+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Given that the only way to get Hextech Annie is through the Hextech system, it would make sense that it is permanently a part of your Hextech inventory.  To be honest, I haven't heard of this as a bug before, so I will do a little further digging.  However, given the uniqueness of the skin, it may be something that will forever be present there!","replies":[{"poster":"YeetOrBeYeeten","date":"2016-05-05T00:06:14.759+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's what I was worried about :/ obviously I would never, but it remaining in my inventory is just worrying because there's the chance I could accidentally disenchant or reroll it. Plus it's just bothersome to have one odd permanent skin remain while the others disappear. I know it's a very minor gripe and you probably have more important issues to address, but if you find out anything, I'd really appreciate it! If it just remains there because it's unique or something and I have to live with it that's fine lol I just wanted to let you guys know if it was a bug or something so hopefully it can get fixed! Thanks again","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
