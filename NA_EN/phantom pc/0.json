I never really posted on this server before I transferred to the Korean Server during Season 2, but I came back because of a problem that occurred to my aquaintance. When transferring the ID to the Korean Server, unlike the NA server where we just had to enter out desired ID and email accounts, we had to insert our national social security number. I had done this myself on both occasions, so I am very familiar with this.\r\n\r\nHowever the problem occurred while my aquaintance was in the army serving his duties for two years. The transfer to the NA->Korean server was only available for a limited time, so my aquaintance's friend  transferred his NA account to Korea in his stead. As he was still in the army at the time, the original owner of the account (my aquaintance) couldn't do it himself. Since the national social security number in Korea was private information and couldn't be just told to people left and right-\r\n\r\n-His account was transferred to KR with his friend's social security number instead.\r\n\r\nDue to this problem, the two are having problems, so I want to ask if you guys can fix this problem and change the account's social security number settings.\r\n\r\nYou can confirm that it is the original owner by confirming the email of the account or something to help him can't you? {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} \r\n\r\nThe account is on the verge of getting deleted because of the problems these two are facing, so I REALLY want to help these two before their relationship turns out for the worse due to a act of goodwill.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-27T23:22:00.877+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I did a little investigating to see if there's anything I could do for this type of situation and this is what I've been able to figure out. \n\nEssentially, we don't normally do transfers to KR and I'm not sure we have ever allowed accounts to be transferred out of KR. Also, it may not have been the best idea to use someone else's social to get the account transferred, since your friend is now unable to get support on that account he can't verify the social. \n\nIn the long run, I'm not sure that your friend will be able to get that account transferred out of KR. My honest best suggestion would be to have him start a new account, write a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) to us explaining the situation, and we may be able to throw him a bone to help him get back to where his old account was.","replies":[{"poster":"Phantom PC","date":"2017-05-31T09:12:54.836+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for the reply Sir Poro :D\n\nHe doesn't want to transfer the account back to the NA Server, sorry for not being clear. My aquaintance wanted his account to stay on the Korean Server, it's just that his account happened to have changed owners during the transfer due the situation at the time. He want's the account to be registered under his own national sercurity number, not his friend's.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Yummy brAKALI","date":"2017-05-27T23:27:03.731+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You Mean An act of goodwill, not a act it's an act","replies":[]}]}
