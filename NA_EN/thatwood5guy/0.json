I recommend continuing to participate in the match; if you have two afk's I understand why you would want to end the inevitably lost game as soon as possible, but you can just farm passively. If your teammates return you won't be as far behind, and if they don't the enemy can still push for the win faster.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ThatWood5Guy","date":"2017-02-04T20:58:31.350+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"that's the thing. at that point, my jungle was no longer mine and i could not farm passively without feeding. stepping near my turrets with me 7 levels behind would result in an ensuing tower dive and another easy kill for the enemy team. standing on fountain prevented me from feeding. but whatever. Next time i'll just attempt to farm and feed, causing the enemy team to just wait for respawns for easy kill counts.
