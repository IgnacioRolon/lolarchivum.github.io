Most challenger players are ADC mains. In the LCS, ranged AP tops are dominant and the only AD mid that matters is Zed.\n\nThe reason is simple: there is essentially no way to counter itemize for sustained magic damage in the late game. Most AD bruisers cannot actually outdamage tanks late game due to the way itemization and base resistances work while having far inferior utility. The only way to beat APs is to beat them in lane such that they never get to late game (Zed) or to assassinate them before a fight even starts so they have no ability to output their damage (most AD bruisers/assassins). However, late game, they don&#039;t need to really put themselves at risk to deal damage. All they need to do is peel for the carry, self peel with Zhonyas and the rest will take care of itself.\n\nThat is why every AP assassin has been incredibly toxic when strong: Nidalee, Akali, Fizz, LeBlanc, Kassadin, etc. have been incredibly broken before some of their horrendous number nerfs and banned far more than analogous AD assassins like Zed, Talon and Kha&#039;Zix - they are simply way harder to itemize against.\n\nI suggest an anti-AP item that ADCs do not benefit from (to keep them risky, in exchange for literally being the carry class) while benefitting other AD champs who frankly need help at this point. It also fixes the problem of Essence Reaver being trash and only good on 3 champs.\n\nEssence Reaver\nFaerie Charm + Hexdrinker + Brutalizer + 333 gold (3300 total)\n\nUNIQUE ACTIVE - Magical Thirst: Deal magic damage to enemy champion equal to 50% of their total AP. Gain that much mana. Excess mana is stored as a mana shield that absorbs damage (90 second cooldown).\nUNIQUE PASSIVE - Lifeline: Upon taking magic damage that would reduce health below 30%, grants a shield that absorbs 250 magic damage for 5 seconds (90 second cooldown).\n\n+100% base mana regen\n+55 AD\n+10% Cooldown Reduction\n+10 Armor Penetration\n+35 Magic Resist","replies":[{"poster":"Venowolf","date":"2015-04-08T07:46:21.973+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Maw OF Malmowtius is the AD anti magic item...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vicarious117","date":"2015-04-08T09:17:00.863+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So I like the idea of dealing damage based on the enemies AP, would give AD bruisers a way of actually dealing with them late game for a change, especially since they all get Zhonya's as well :P\n\nBut that being said, it being a mana focused item still kind of removes it as an option for MANY of the AD bruisers who would need it.  So I'd suggest keeping the idea of damage based on target's AP, or maybe their current mana or something since when they have low mana they're far less useful already, but focus more on AD and tankiness and remove the mana restoration aspect.\n\nNot too mention this item idea is tailored to handling AP mages and tanks late game, late game when mana pools are far less of an issue for AD bruisers and tanks, so focusing on mana restoration is kind of contradictory.","replies":[{"poster":"BluePolarizer","date":"2015-04-08T09:22:28.936+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's just 5 melee ADs that are manaless who actually matter:\n\n1.

Since late game most mana using ADs are almost always full mana, its essentially a scaling shield that allows you to basically create a ~600 HP difference between you and an AP opponent if you are using mana. It gives mana using ADs a way to almost guarantee favorable trades against an enemy AP in duels.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"DisasterSola","date":"2015-04-08T09:15:08.481+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"... I think that Maw works better. this seems like a ball of stats kind of item. \nI think, instead, making the passive an actual BURN (2~8% of damage dealt is returned as mana, and reduces the enemy champions mana by the same amount).

In particular, Master Yi, Xin Zhao, Jayce, Hecarim, Jax, Irelia and Trundle use this item better than Maw, since they don't need the stat stick of Maw, use mana and benefit from all pieces.
