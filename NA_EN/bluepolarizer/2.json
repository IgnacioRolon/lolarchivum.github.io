Completely turning off stealth with a 75 gold item therefore completely turns off a % of a stealth champ's kit and power with 0 counterplay and no compensation. It isn't 2 equal champions fighting on even ground. It's 100% of a champion fighting 80% of a champion. Stealth isn't something just tacked onto a kit that is the same as a non-stealth champ's.\n\nThe issue was that stealth was just so ***bad*** that Riot had to massively tune stealth champions' numbers based on the assumption that their stealth wouldn't actually work. The goal was to make stealth actually reliable so the numbers can be tuned back down. If you have an issue with the numbers then that can be fixed pretty easily without destroying the champion's entire gameplay identity.\n\nPlopping down a Pink Ward and instantly deleting a stealth champ before they even realize their stealth isn't working anymore has 0 counterplay and has never been nor ever will be good gameplay design. Individual stealth abilities need to have some gameplay for both sides to play around, but at the end of the day a champ has to actually exit stealth to attack and can still be hit by skillshots and AoE even while invisible.\n\nAsking for stealth to involve more interaction is fine. Asking for stealth to revert back to a binary and unreliable state just because you want an \"Easy Mode\" button to deal with it is not.","replies":[{"poster":"TheLazyOne","date":"2017-03-12T13:44:57.064+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Personally I could never accept the logic that an immobile ward has no counterplay.\n   Theoretically (it's more nuanced in practice but such is League) assassins have the luxury of engagement, they have the stealth to choose when and how they approach and they tools to instantly kill you - at least if you're playing something squishier. Yesterday I had a match, I saw Vayne's Tumble effect on the edge of the FoW, I knew I was dead. Last week a half-dead Talon got accidentally knocked on top of my Tristana, his Q+E killed me from full hp before I could knock him away. But that's fine and is brimming with counterplay. \n\nAt least when I could buy a pink I would know when they're coming and the high risk part of their gameplay is actually there when they can walk into the wrong place at the wrong time like everyone else. Plus they have teammates too to clear an area of pinks before a fight is on and generally help them get the kill.","replies":[{"poster":"DrCyanide","date":"2017-03-12T16:10:56.615+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Yesterday I had a match, I saw Vayne's Tumble effect on the edge of the FoW, I knew I was dead. \n\nAnd if it'd been someone of your same skill level playing a Mage instead of an ADC they would have all the information they needed to throw out a skillshot slow or a stun, either hitting Vayne or forcing her to dodge and take a longer path.
