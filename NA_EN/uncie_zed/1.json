I hope that the portal he jumps in looks like the one from the PROJECT teaser on the internet :D \r\n\r\nSPLASH ART:\r\n--&gt; same, I will edit this when it will come on the pbe :D\r\n\r\nTL;DR : AWESOME skin that can be improved with some little changes.\r\n\r\nThank you for your comprehension !\r\n\r\nUncle Zed","replies":[{"poster":"Garbageteammates","date":"2015-08-25T20:57:50.169+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yes please take out the blue and change his camera to a visor an assassin is supposed to be dark and sexy not iron man","replies":[]},{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-08-25T16:21:10.304+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hiya! \n\nMeant to comment on this a couple days ago when we were gathering feedback.
