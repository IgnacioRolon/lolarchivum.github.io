You dont. Theres a tiered system of punishments. You get a 10 game cr, 25 game cr, 14 day ban, then permaban. To get that permaban, all you have to do is break the rules after a 14 day ban.

That's unfortunate, and I'm sorry you had to deal with it. If this misbehavior happened in chat (including emotes or ping) and they don't respond positively to a _single, courteous, constructive request to focus on the game_, your best option is to mute that player. Submit a report after the match. This is equivalent to dealing with a noisy person in a library by asking them to keep it down and then notifying library staff and moving to another area.\n\n_Do not respond with misbehavior of your own!_ If you do that, your teammates may mute and report _you_, and those reports would be valid. This is equivalent to dealing with a noisy person in a library by getting into a shouting match with them. Just because someone else started it doesn't justify you in continuing it. I'm sure you're familiar with the \"s/he started it\" trope, where two children get into an argument or fight and then try to claim innocence of any wrongdoing by claiming that they didn't instigate it. As any parent, teacher, or other supervisor of children will tell you, that excuse doesn't fly. When Dad is trying to drive you to Disneyland and your annoying brother starts making faces at you as he's previously been told not to, you should calmly ask him to stop, and then, if that doesn't work, calmly notify your parents of the problem. Making faces at him or shouting at him has never been a good way to get him to stop, and it makes you just as guilty of that as he.\n\nRiot doesn't care who started it. Someone else's misbehavior does not justify your own.\n\nFrom [Riot's support knowledgebase](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207489286-Instant-Feedback-System-FAQ-):\n\n> * Simply speaking, retaliation is not an acceptable or justifiable behavior. An argument between two players can easily create a negative experience for the rest of the players in the game with you. Regardless of the other player’s actions, this does not justify your own behavior. You alone are responsible for your actions within the game.If you encounter a toxic player like this, the best option is to simply report their behavior and move on.\n> * Reports are a vital piece to the puzzle. If you are not sure of what sort of behavior is reportable take a look at the [Reporting a Player FAQ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752884-Reporting-a-Player)\n\nIf you misbehave but a teammate or opponent does or says something even worse, you should definitely report them after the match, just as someone reported you for your own misbehavior. Yes, that's certainly possible. Reports are not a limited resource. Any time someone believes that another player violated LoL's behavioral standards, they can report that player. Punishments are similarly not limited: if more than one player in a game merits a punishment, they can both get a punishment. This can happen even if the players in question were antagonizing each other. The IFS doesn't need to weigh the severity of all reported players' actions and then \"award\" the \"winner\" with a punishment; it's not a contest.\n\nThink of it like dealing with a noisy person in a library: ask them to keep it down, and then notify library staff and move to another area if that doesn't work. If you get into a shouting match with them, you're just as likely to be removed, even if you weren't shouting _quite_ as loudly as they were. The goal is a quiet library.\n\nThere is nothing in Riot's behavioral rules that excuses toxic chat as long as it's factual. It's technically possible for someone to literally be matched with the worst player on the planet, but there's no reason to spend the match calling them the worst player on the planet. It won't make them better at LoL, it won't make them feel better, and it won't help you win the match. All it will do is make them feel worse, annoy your team, and get you punished for breaking the rules, \"facts\" or not. It's technically true that 2+2=4, but if you announce that fact to your team every four seconds, that's spam and it will annoy them until they mute you, followed by a report and a punishment. It's a true fact, but spamming it is still punishable. Announcing a struggling teammate's score every time they die might be a recitation of fact, but all that does is harass the teammate by calling attention to their poor performance. It won't improve their performance; it might actually exacerbate the problem by tilting them. Scores are factual, but that doesn't make it okay to harass someone.\n\nYou weren't punished for misbehaving in one game. You were punished for misbehaving in _one more_ game, in a consistent pattern of negative behavior that breaks the game's rules. Additionally, the reform card doesn't always show all the logs that led to your punishment: it randomly selects up to several logs. You might see three logs, but you also might see as few as one, even for players whose punishment stems not from a small number of egregious infractions but rather from dozens of instances of mild toxicity. The purpose of the reform card is to tell you how to reform, so it shows you an example of the behavior that prompted your punishment and explains that such behavior is inappropriate and should be avoided if you want to maintain an account in good standing.\n\nUsually, one transgression by itself wouldn't be enough to bring such a punishment to an otherwise clean account, but the IFS works on an escalating punishment system. Breaking a minor rule, like engaging the team in useless arguments, has a minor punishment: a chat restriction. Breaking that same rule over and over again, however, doesn't prompt an endless series of chat restrictions. The severity of the punishment ramps up over time, because the goal is to eliminate the punished player's willingness to break the game's rules. If two chat restrictions don't stop the useless arguments, the system will increase the punishment to a 14-day suspension and deliver a very clear message that the continued rule-breaking is becoming a serious issue and any further instances will result in a permaban. Again, the point is to put a stop to this misbehavior. If a player is more interested in repeatedly breaking the rules than in maintaining access to their account, they'll lose access to their account.\n\nOf course, it's possible to break major rules, like cheating, threatening people, or using chat for hate speech, and skip punishment tiers so that a clean account ends up with a 14-day suspension or even a permaban.\n\nFrom [Riot's support knowledgebase](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207489286-Instant-Feedback-System-FAQ-):\n\n> **PUNISHMENTS GENERALLY FOLLOW A BASIC ESCALATION PATH:**\n> \n> * First Offense: 10 Game Chat Restriction\n> * Second Offense: 25 Game Chat Restriction\n> * Third Offense: Two Week Suspension\n> * Fourth Offense: Permanent Suspension\n> \n> However, it is possible to skip to a Two Week or Permanent suspension based on the severity of the behavior in the game. Excessive negative behavior can result in a Two-Week or Permanent suspension at any time without having a chat restriction on the account.\n\nTheft is defined as \"the action or crime of stealing,\" and stealing is defined as \"taking (another person's property) without permission or legal right and without intending to return it.\" When a player purchases RP, they give money to Riot and Riot increases a number in a database that Riot owns and operates. When that player spends the RP, Riot decreases the aforementioned number and simultaneously makes another change to the account which that player is allowed to access. This change might be a flag indicating that a certain skin can now be selected, or an increase in the number of rune pages customizable from that account. At no point in time does Riot sell, rent, or license any kind of ownership of any of Riot's assets to any player. Players are simply allowed to access the account they create, with their authorized credentials.\n\nThis is no different from accessing any other private entity's services. If you notice that a wall at a friend's house is very plain and you buy them a painting to spruce it up, that painting now belongs to your friend. If your friend forbids you from coming into their house, which could be for no reason, any reason, or very good reason (e.g. that you continually broke clearly-defined rules and ignored all reprimands and requests to change your behavior), you don't get to keep the painting. You also aren't owed the financial value of the painting, nor does helping with the decor grant you any right to keep hanging out at your (former) friend's house.","replies":[]},{"poster":"iron4playa","date":"2019-11-03T16:14:33.143+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"post full log","replies":[]},{"poster":"Eedat","date":"2019-11-02T03:15:50.637+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lets see the full chat log.

Honestly riot is just encouraging toxicity in champ select. The large amounts of autofills begging to role swap every few games. \n\nRagequitting at 5 minutes is also not bannable, because riot cant tell the difference between a ragequit and a real life situation dc, and in my opinion a rage quit is so much more fucking toxic than someone who called someone else a piece of shit for banning their champion to troll them. and yet ragequitting is met with almost no punishment, but if the punishment was harsher people who had real life problems connecting would be negatively impacted too.\n\nThe only time a teamate should ban your champion is if the champion is so fucking broken on meta tier list that the team that picks it first wins, and ur team is not first pick. That is a very rare situation, and banning teammate champions on first pick side should be a bannable offense. Riot system should be able to detect when you ban a teamates champion, as it already gives a warning, i don't see why this couldn't be implemented further (but only on first pick side, as i mentioned before there could be such broken meta that the ban is warranted)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Der Lindwurm","date":"2019-11-02T00:35:12.388+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":6,"body":"If this is banworthy, then at least half of all the people I play with every day should be banned.","replies":[]}]}
