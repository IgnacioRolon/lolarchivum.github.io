I play league for fun, not to listen to people bitch at me for every thing I do that they don't like. Riot realizes that they are losing business to people like that and have decided to kindly escort the people causing them to leave out of their establishment.\n\nIf you don't like it, you can always find another game to play. I would suggest a single player game, so that others don't have to put up with you.","replies":[{"poster":"awholepie","date":"2017-03-06T14:38:46.113+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"I never put my team mates down for having a poor a game, but my choice of vocabulary to describe Rito's mathematics is just too strong of language for the league of snowflakes.","replies":[{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-03-06T17:24:05.901+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"What math in particular do you have issues with?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"EvilDustMan","date":"2017-03-06T11:12:27.588+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can see you are obviously a level headed and reasonable person.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Makior72","date":"2017-03-06T17:51:54.675+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"3 edgy 5 me","replies":[]}]}
