The first time my client crashed I was able to miraculously get back into the game, unfortunately {{champion:133}} was already fed with 30+ farm than me. We lost the game.\r\n\r\nNow, after that incident, I restarted my laptop, restarted the client and hoped that it was not going to happen anymore.\r\nAfter a couple games my client crashed right after champion select. I was not able to return to game even after several tries causing the team to eventually remake and made me lose 18LP. \r\n\r\nI think this is a little bit unfair since it is technically not my fault that the client crashes and bugs out on me.\r\n\r\nIs there a solution or something we can do about this?\r\n\r\nI'm afraid if I join another ranked game I will crash and be demoted.\r\n\r\nThoughts?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-08T19:50:38.018+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sucks to hear that this crashing has been continuous, and I want to help!  Can you clarify what you mean exactly by crash?  When is it happening, and are there any error messages?  Are there bugsplats?  We can't alter game stats, but it's crucial to fix this up and prevent further occurrences.
