I crafted the key and went to unlock the chest. The loot tab froze so i went over to the store tab and when i returned to the loot tab the key and chest were gone. As far as i can tell i have nothing new unlocked. Where did they go? Any clue as to what happened?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-04-13T21:22:14.413+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even if the animation froze, the information should still get to our server and unlock your content.  It looks like you got 150 orange essences and an Arcade Baron icon as a result.  Nice!  Unless you had a connection hiccup, this kind of freeze can happen if you have any third party programs that interact with league.  if that's the case for you, disabling it should fix things up.  I hope that helps!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lew","date":"2017-04-13T03:22:37.258+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've had this happen in the past and it is likely an icon was unlocked from the chest.  If you check your purchase history you should see which icon it was.","replies":[{"poster":"AGoatOnABoat","date":"2017-04-13T03:33:03.995+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"cheers","replies":[]}]}]}
