Sadly we don't have a way to make League download quicker after an uninstall. You could always try using a hardwired connection while it's download, and also I'd suggest [**configuring your DNS settings**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664#wq5) to see if you can get a clearer connection to our servers too. That should at least be able to get the download going a little faster!","replies":[]}]}
