Help!","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello, I am from NA servers and I usually play League of Legends on about 50-70 ping which is fantastic. But the past week or so at around 5:30 PM my ping has increased to about 150 and stays there until about 2:00 AM. I have reset my router countless times, uninstalled the client and reinstalled with no change. It doesn't even change the speed of anything else on my computer but LoL.
