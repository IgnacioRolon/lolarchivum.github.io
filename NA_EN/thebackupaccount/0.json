I was silver 4 and i won my matches and it said i was promoted to SILVER 3. Someone explain please, this doesnt make sense and why does it say promoted.","replies":[{"poster":"Son of Ornn","date":"2017-11-15T22:41:10.258+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well that does look like it's working as intended and promoted properly. Hope I'm not missing something. D:\n\nTo clarify, from Silver 4, your promotion will bring you up to Silver 3. From there, you go to S2, then S1. And then you promote into Gold, and start in Gold 5. In short, the numbers should go down as you Rank up! Does that make sense? :)","replies":[{"poster":"TheBackupAccount","date":"2017-11-20T20:35:44.449+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I see, thanks for your reply.
