The fact that my laptop can go from 300+ fps to 1 fps ( I am not joking I have pictures ) is bullshit. This only happened **in this patch** and they are just saying to update drivers and such. I wish they had the decency to actually put some effort from their part individually and address this issue.","replies":[{"poster":"g0ngy","date":"2017-03-19T20:26:06.683+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same boat except I only start at 120's or so.

I'd like to see if fixing that first will bring that FPS back up. We can try using something like [**MSI Afterburner**](https://www.msi.com/page/afterburner) to manually turn that fan on.\n\nLet me know how that works for you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"g0ngy","date":"2017-03-19T19:46:23.354+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its been something with the patch. There's lots of people (check Reddit) complaining. Riot will say use hextech repair tool and good luck. I've tried it a few times to no avail. Try the tool if not hope it's fixed soon","replies":[]}]}
