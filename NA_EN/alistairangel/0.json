She&#039;s now a character that completely relies on getting her ult to dish anything out. I understand that there are some champs that are like this but most of them have CC or something in their kit to be held over. _BEFORE _ anyone brings up charm That thing can easily be minion blocked or side stepped while other champs have slows or things in previously stated champions who rely on level 6, their kit that ignore minions. I can understand a buff to her W Foxifire but ultimately they nerfed her entire kit to oblivion. She can&#039;t do a whole lot in lane now. Champs like Lux and other mages are going to be more picked now because they can do what Ahri does but better. Also for those saying &quot;Hey it&#039;s like old Ahri now again&quot; There&#039;s a reason she was changed and don&#039;t let the nostalgia door hit you on the @$$ on the way out.","replies":[{"poster":"Ahri Baka","date":"2018-03-08T23:58:13.169+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nah , I like the changes as a One Trick Ahri , perhaps she will be OP and and higher winrates , she has 52% winrate right , imo she is weak atm but idk why 52%\nStill I'm excited for the changes , at least I can finally 100-0 someone when I complete 1-2 items","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-03-09T00:02:20.601+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Hikari Sakata,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Vi6mFPI9,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2018-03-08T23:58:13.169+0000)\n>\n> Nah , I like the changes as a One Trick Ahri , perhaps she will be OP and and higher winrates , she has 52% winrate right , imo she is weak atm but idk why 52%\n> Still I&#x27;m excited for the changes , at least I can finally 100-0 someone when I complete 1-2 items\n\nThe speed on Q is relatively new, it was a poor decision to add in in place of more damage.

That's late game crap. I'm focusing on her early game where she gets outdamaged, outscaled and outranged. Without that speed buff she's essentially USELESS for early game.

A lot of people saw this as too much where as a person who put countless hours into learning Ahri saw this as something that was needed. If they kept that I'd have no problem with recent events just removing that and as squishy as she is seems like too much. I brought up Lux because her Q even if it hits a minion can still cut through and lock down. Her W gives a slow and is AOE. Ahri's only thing is now her Charm which can't cut through minion crowds or it'd be too strong. Her ult is a level 6 and that's fine but it turns her early game into trash and she can be shut down TOO fast if not taken with absolute and EXTREME caution. Other midlane mages don't have this problem. Her range is also something to be desired as most midlane mages have a good extensive range.","replies":[]}]}]}
