I&#039;ll go through the reasons real quick:\r\n\r\n- You gave Viktor the altruistic and idealistic motivations his character deserves. Everything he does is in the name of rescuing humanity from itself and ending problems like war and hunger, even if his methods are very questionable at best sometimes. \r\n- You kept him real. When he made the order to kill Jayce, you noted that he seemed upset to have to kill someone he once considered to be a friend. That opens up great potential for him to go on a bit of an emotional journey and really weigh the consequences of what he&#039;s doing and what he&#039;s doing it for. Perfect window for character development, no matter where he goes after it.\r\n- You turned his Gary Stu nemesis into a less-than-perfect Tony Stark kind of character. It makes their rivalry feel much less one-sided, and it helps the reader focus on the philosophical and ethical differences they have. \r\n\r\nI&#039;d love to know who was responsible for this lore so I can thank them personally. If they want to remain anonymous, that&#039;s cool too. Just know that as someone that loves Viktor, I really appreciate what you&#039;ve done.\r\n\r\n- Zooreka","replies":[{"poster":"Nefas","date":"2016-12-08T04:13:09.258+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"I also liked the Viktor lore. His character is grey - taking actions others might consider wrong that he considers necessary (but perhaps truly unfortunate) for what he believes is the greater good. He's not evil just to be evil. Sometimes it seems like people are too militantly against Viktor having any darkness in what may be lingering after effects of the first set of Jayce lore, which I sympathize with for sure.\n\nHopefully we get some more lore directly from his perspective in a Zaun half of the event. He certainly deserves that (along with a new skin).","replies":[{"poster":"Zooreka","date":"2016-12-08T04:16:29.688+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh, does he need a new skin.
