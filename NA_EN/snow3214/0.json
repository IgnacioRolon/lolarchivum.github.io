My ping is around 30-40, download speed is 1.95, and upload speed is 0.25 if that helps. Throughout most of the game it runs perfectly fine with 30-40 ping, and then BAM, a 500 ping spike that makes \"attempting to reconnect\" pop up, forcing me to leave the game. \r\n\r\nI've tried to reconnect after that multiple times, and each time I am not able to get on. I've had the same issue with starcraft lotv, but not with hearthstone or tf2. I am on wifi and I am not able to use an Ethernet cable so that isn't a solution. I've had this problem for about 6 months now, and I am really hoping someone could help me, thanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Gear Jammer","date":"2016-09-27T04:04:28.088+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sounds like packet losshow far are you from the router also do as targon said and follow those instructions... diagnosing a computer issue is oftem trial and error as many things can cause the same symtoms","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-26T23:05:06.957+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Latency (ping) issues are most often caused by incompatible network settings or routing issues to the server.
