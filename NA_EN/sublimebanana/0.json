I can start game a game and play, but the chat in launcher, during champ select and inviting/being seen by other players does not work.\n\nI have downloaded the hextech repair tool and ran it (elevated) to repatch, then full clean reinstall to no avail.  The issue still persists and from what I can tell I'm the only one I've talked to that is having this problem.\n\nI submitted a bug stating the issue and have not heard back about it.  At a loss on what I can do to fix this issue and any thoughts would be helpful on what I haven't tried already.\n\nThanks,\n\n\nEdit: Pic\nChat Connection Issue https://imgur.com/gallery/HTzhF","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-08-18T22:45:58.863+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Thanks for the report here!  We've seen some reports on this over the last day from a small amount of players, and checking to see if there might be anything going on.
