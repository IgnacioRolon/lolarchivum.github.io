More specifically telling you to be careful while you are in a fight that you have to commit to. The ping is annoying and throws me off my game and i was wondering if there is a way to mute pings since muting a player still shows their pings. Thank you!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-15T22:01:57.093+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Too many pings can certainly be an earful, and there is an option to help with that!  While it's not currently possible to mute a single player's mute, you can reduce ping volume.  The option is available in-game under Sound Options, and an option for ping sound.  There is also a limit to how many times a player can ping in a duration, so it doesn't spam.  Hope that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"SkillerRocker","date":"2016-12-20T16:26:09.530+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What's the reason why you don't let us mute a single player's pings? \nIf that player is repetitively spamming (question mark) pings, it is extremely annoying for one, while it distracts not even you but also the <insert bad name, i.e. idiot> who is spamming them.\n\nI do want to hear the pings of my other team members clearly, so reducing the total ping volume is not a good solution (it diminishes proper communication way too much).\n\nAt least let me lower their ping limit to 4, something more bearable and realistic.","replies":[]}]}]}
