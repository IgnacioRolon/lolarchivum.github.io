If positive, then I'll be glad with the rework, **but if negative I won't even get to shape the rework of my favorite champion**.\n\nI also want to say next time hold these discussions on the forums and not on Reddit. I find it unacceptable that Riot would share something like this and be gathering feedback off it from a source that doesn't involve their own boards.\n\nNow, what I don't like:  \n1. Boomerang dash. Would like it better if I had control over the boomerang effect.  \n2. Skillshot ult that can be blocked and roots you.  \n3. I play ww as a bruiser, but now I'm incentivized to play him AP tank. Why?  \n4. The AoE attack speed was too strong indeed, but the self attack speed didn't have to be scrapped.  \n5. CC-lock new WW in a fight and he's lost all his stacks  \n6. You communicated his rework. You Didn't GATHER IDEAS about new skills beforehand or ASK PLAYERS WHAT THEY LIKED, (esp. us dedicated players)  \n7. If direction is as I believe it is, he has poor itemization options.  \n\nWhat I like:  \n1. Strengths cleared up, weaknessess made more clear.  \n2. His W is more interesting.  \n3.
