The TL:DR is that, in general, we take action against players who use programs that can be used to gain a competitive advantage. Because you don't write the program yourself, the developer could slip some new feature in there that wasn't initially in there, and cause it to violate our [terms of use. ](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/legal/termsofuse)\n\nAs with any program that edits or modifies the League folder, if you choose to make those changes or use a program that does, you do so at your own risk.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions.","replies":[{"poster":"LBmyBB","date":"2016-09-05T00:48:32.609+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im pretty sure that this is just a visual custom skin, and obviously no one else can see it but me.
