The quality is still crappy, like I could record the replay with obs and post it on youtube if you wanna see for yourself.  And the sound isn't as bad, but it is definitely still there.

The quality was better, not as refined in game, but so much better.  The sound was normal.  What's weird is that if I played it with windows the sound would be all weird and viewing it with anything else afterwards would retain the weirdness.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-23T22:40:34.480+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Gotcha, I'm glad to hear things worked the second time around.
