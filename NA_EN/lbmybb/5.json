Instead of asking LeBlanc mains and people who played her either since release or for a very long time, you decide to send a survey to random players? I bet many of them never even played LB or just hate her so much that they will do anything to destroy her even more. Many players don't even understand what LB's problems are and how to fix them but they WILL decide for all of us because they got a survey.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-21T20:24:57.926+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Woaa woa woa, nobody ever said she was being reworked quite yet XD","replies":[{"poster":"pretty hurts","date":"2017-07-21T20:45:20.388+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"We were told she was being worked on but it's going slowly and won't be released till after worlds patch.","replies":[{"poster":"EROTIC RAID BOSS","date":"2017-07-22T02:40:46.513+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"rn it seems like theyre focused on xin Zhao and azir. but don't freak out because they get some feedback from surveys, they get feedback from a lot of sources","replies":[{"poster":"pretty hurts","date":"2017-07-22T14:26:04.636+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"For someone like me who played her since release in 2010 and has been through every nerf, buff or any other change she got during this time it's just annoying and feels unfair.

Don't mean to detract from the thread, but I got a message in-client recently that asked me to take a survey.
