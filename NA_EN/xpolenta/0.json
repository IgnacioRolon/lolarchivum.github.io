We stayed away from the reds at first, since she's got some of that in her base skin. Enough players spoke out, saying they were unhappy with the pink, especially when it came to her fitting cohesively with the Blood Moon skin line. That's when we started taking feedback into discussions, and working to find a color that made sense for the skin line, as well as compromising with what players were saying about the skin.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Cuix","date":"2014-12-05T22:20:48.571+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":5,"body":"Seriously?

As I've pointed out before, the decision was based on both the community being split pretty evenly on if they wanted red or pink for the color scheme, as well as making a skin that was still fitting cohesively with the Blood Moon skin line. \n\nAs far as learning people feeling disappointed, I've seen a surprising amount of feedback that's neutral to positive.

(This seems like a notion Riot frequently and deeply struggles with, so I don't blame you for misunderstanding my point.)\n\n\n> As far as learning people feeling disappointed, I've seen a surprising amount of feedback that's neutral to positive.

However, this is a small biased group, so I'll trust that what you're seeing is more accurate.\n\nPersonally, I preferred the pink but found the red significantly more fitting. The final version doesn't feel very Blood Moon-ish, but it's very pretty and I'm not an Elise player anyway.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zan Vorez","date":"2014-12-06T19:42:34.740+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"How is making a promise NEVER a good idea and why is nobody questioning this statement?

This can be deceiving, because they may not ever actually use the color combo, which would leave a lot of players waiting/hoping for something that'll never come (ie. they found other themes and colors instead).

But that wasn't the actual problem, we've gotten sidetracked on this point when the real problem is making her feel Blood Moon and matching the rest of the skins cohesively.  **This is NOT limited to fooling around with the red/pink**.  The fact of the matter is that she doesn't look Blood Moon, doesn't fit in comparison to the rest of the skins, and THAT's the actual problem that we should be focusing on.  A lot of it has to with the model itself and the character that was chosen (problems with skin looking to much like base, problems with clashing with particles), and the problems with color is a byproduct of that.\n\n**The Mask:** For one many have pointed out how the mask looks more like I'm going to a ballroom/masquerade.  It's the only Blood Moon skin mask that doesn't look like it would cover her whole face, that is not immediately recognizable as white, and that doesn't have horns.  It just doesn't look like a Hannya mask at all (google images Hannya).  Who knows, maybe had the original pink model had a way better mask, people wouldn't have gotten so fixated on it being pink.  After all Kalista isn't red yet we can immediately tell she's Blood Moon.  And there lies the other problem with the model . . .\n\n**The clothing**  . . . it doesn't have a lot of armor, the way shen/thresh/kalista does.  The details get lost with those giant spider legs of hers and her posture - from certain angles it looks like she's wearing a bikini top instead of an oriental style dress.  I'm not saying we need to give her armor, but because she's wearing a dress like Akali, and the details are getting lost, then this is why we need to rely on color to convey the theme of the skin.  Which brings us to  . . .\n\n**Color scheme** As this and the rest of your posts show, the focus is on *\"some people don't like pink, let's change to red, oh people didn't like it, let's go back to pink, oh people are split 50/50 so maybe halfway between red/pink\"*  all the while **COMPLETELY DISREGARDING THE REST OF THE COLORS!**  If you change the the pink to red without considering how that red matches the gold and blue originally chosen to match the pink - then of course you're not going to get 100% approval on the change since it's an incomplete change.  The rest of the colors needed to be changed to match accordingly.  Personally I think the pink/gold/blue looks great.  But it doesn't look Blood Moon!  It's not just that you need more red, you need more white, the gold has too much green hue in it, the blue on the tips doesn't fit in.  As I pointed out, you don't have the luxury of playing with the palette like you did with Kalista because the model doesn't lend itself to it.  Which is why to really convey Blood Moon you would need to focus on red/white/silver-grey-metal the way Akali/Shen do. \n\nTL;DR So please start experimenting with changing the color of her legs etc.  and fixing the mask, and not just playing with variations in pink/red.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JustBoneBrook","date":"2014-12-06T20:43:20.864+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> I'm sorry you're not a fan of the color scheme we chose for Blood Moon Elise. \n> \n> The opinions of if she should be pink or red were actually split pretty 50/50.

This is why I find Armor of the fifth age Taric skin as the worst skin around.  It's also why I have a distaste for Popstar Ahri.\nAt the moment, I see the second version of the skin as the best, the one that was nearly pure red. For the current version, while the spider form is light red (not pink enough for me to dislike it), human form seems... a little... too pinkish.\n\nBut, I'm one guy here.\nThough, I'll probably pick it up, regardless.  Can't deny white hair...\n\nIf you're wondering why I hate the color pink.  You can thank a dev from Artix Entertainment named \"Beleen\".  She would always find a way to add a pink armor/cape/weapon/helmet for each release of something.

It was mentioned that pink vs red appear to be a 50/50 discussion. What I read most out of this is \"I like the pink but the red matches the bloodmoon better\". When I first saw the model I thought \"Wow! This is so nice. ... But why is it pink? :/\" Then it got changed into red and I was very relieved, as colours were way more vibrant now, the red making Elise actually feel BLOOD (!) moonish. \n\nI do agree the latest change being a very nice compromise between the two arguing parties, however I don't feel like this should be the right solution, even when the goal is to satisfy as many as possible.\n\nTo summarise my opinion: I basically like the pink (v1) version, but I definitely prefer the red (v2) version.

(Even though with the model I feel reminded a bit of Victorious Elise)\nBut.\nDoes the splash really have to be that dark and include so much (!) blue?

My main reason (again) for this opinion: the Blood Moon theme. Which in my eyes clearly pictures the red/blood in the foreground, given the white/moon as a contrast. At least it's what I've seen in the other Blood Moon skins so far. I'm totally ok with the splash being dark, but I think Elise probably should be more... Highlighted? No?
