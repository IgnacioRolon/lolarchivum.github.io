When i played a round of lol, the client wont start up again. After clicking \"Victory/Defeat\" the game closes but i suddenly find myself on my desktop, with no trace of any lol client running.\r\nIf this happens, i have to relaunch lol and login in again. I miss out on all the fun in the post game screen, cant report or honor players and cannot watch all those fancy grids and graphs.\r\nI cant reproduce it at will, it just happens sometimes.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-02-04T17:32:51.170+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know you've gone through a few steps which is great, but it's really important to go through each step to rule out possibilities.
