I asked my other teammates if they saw the glitch as well, and they said that when I performed an emote, my character appeared to be &quot;floating&quot;.\r\n\r\nAfter the game was done, I went to go test her other skins in a custom game. I only have Guerrilla and Buccaneer, and so far, those skins (including her classic) don&#039;t seemed to be affected by this bug. Only her Riot Girl skin.\r\n\r\nWhile the glitch isn&#039;t very game breaking, it&#039;s a little distracting to watch. Even if it is a little funny as well. Here are some videos that I posted on my Youtube channel to better explain the bug.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance! ^^\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DT3bc8s9IHA \r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADaaRzVZiP0","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-08-01T03:12:05.726+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hiya! \n\nThanks for the report!
