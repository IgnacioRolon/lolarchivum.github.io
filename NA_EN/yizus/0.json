I have Windows Vista, and this morning i go to log onto league, the client wont open! Riot my PC has more then enough specs to run league of legends, Windows 10 wont download onto my computer, i have put over 50$ into league of legends. Why then do you purposely fuck me over, purposely not allow me to play league of legends? Why do i have to buy a new laptop when my laptop is powerful enough?","replies":[{"poster":"ImAHeroForFun","date":"2016-05-17T19:11:24.705+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lolol... holy crap... this is whats wrong with America.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RiotBok","date":"2016-05-16T22:43:00.056+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you can provide more information about the error you're seeing, we'd be happy to take a look.
