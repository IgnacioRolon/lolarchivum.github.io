It got me thinking a lot about the friendships I developed playing League in college.\n\nCollege is a strange time in everyones life. It’s essentially a social reset where you’re left to build a whole new group of friends. During the weeks leading up to my first day of school, I started playing League with a friend's friend. Since it was the summer, we played a few times a day and really got to know each other. It was about a week before school started that we realized we were going to be attending the same college and would live in the same dormitory.\n\nI missed the official move in date and showed up a few days late after all the freshman orientation activities, so everyone sort of had a leg up on me. Once I met up with him I was introduced to everyone he had already been hanging out with. We all had a common interest in video games, and it wasn’t long until we all played League together for the first time (had to play in the communal laundry room for the best connection). \n\nThe people I met in that first week went on to be my roommates for the next four years. We played in some of the first college tournaments and eventually started a League of Legends club at our school. Even now that we have graduated, we still play League together as much as possible.\n\n**How has League (or other video games) influenced your friendships in school? **","replies":[{"poster":"zoze284","date":"2015-02-18T21:22:48.612+0000","up_votes":38,"down_votes":2,"body":"I had friends then I played League.","replies":[{"poster":"Awes0meEman","date":"2015-02-19T02:48:43.199+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you {{champion:32}} ?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dangerous Man","date":"2015-02-19T01:49:52.051+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://www.memes.at/faces/forever_alone_speaking.gif","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"PoppenKill","date":"2015-02-18T21:29:15.719+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":0,"body":"I didn't have much friends at my college.

I was a little afraid that she was going to pick on me for playing league but to my surprise she smiled and said ME TOO! after class we talked league for about an hour before we got into the rift together back at our dorms. It turns out that she also had a lot of friends at the same college who play league. Now i have a group of friends that i play LoL actively and skype together. It really has changed my college experience. \n\nThank you for an amazing game bringing together awesome people.

That all changed when I came to my college. Someone noticed me browsing the League of Legends subreddit on my laptop and called me out on it. Quickly, I learned that there was an Esports club at the college and I decided to come to a few meetings. At first, it was weird. I'd never been surrounded by so many people who were as in love with games as I was. Not only that but, almost every single one of the people attending the meetings was an avid League player. I quickly fell in love with the idea of the club and started to attend more and more meetings and hung out with all the people there, swiftly making friends. \n\nNow, I'm an officer for the club and help recruit for the club. We've had countless of people join in who were in the same situation as me, not really knowing how to express their love of games in real life. I've made so many friends and it's all because of video games, and specifically League of Legends.

Since there is no item grinding or raid farming those of us who only play once a week can still hone our skills in fair fights where we aren't hopelessly under geared for the situation like we always were in WoW arenas. Following this we even added a few new friends to our friends lists with a couple co-workers and even a kid I used to babysit who was now 18 and playing League with us, coordinating on skype (Which was really, really strange at first considering I babysat him when he was 6. Totally makes me feel old every time he's on the team.)\n\nOverall League has been the game of choice for us filthy casuals because it doesn't interfere with the rest of our lives and allows us to keep in touch as well as foster a new enjoyment for the game. Recently one of my friends even introduced his son to the game and we've been playing twinks with him to help him learn. He still hasn't graduated past struggling against bots, but hey we all have to start somewhere.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jubbinaut","date":"2015-02-19T01:52:59.235+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I survived high school because of video games.

Read on for my sappy story:\n\nI moved to the United States from Bulgaria way back in 2006. I was supposed to be in third grade but the American elementary system was behind what I had already learned and so they placed me in 4th grade (big jump I know). I had a LOT of problems adjusting to the culture. The other kids didn't understand me at all, I couldn't really speak English, and my step brother at the time would make up rumors about me and all the kids started to hate me, or at least dislike me and shun me. Fast forward to middle school, nothing had really improved. I would eat lunch alone, go home and cry to my mom about how I have no friends, and make up stories about having friends when I was with other family members so I didn't have to face my shame. One Halloween I hit a particular low point. I had nobody to go trick-or-treating with and so I went with my mom, alone. I would go up to houses and get candy and nobody would say anything to me except for this one lady, who asked me where all my friends were and why I was alone, and I lied to her and told her they ran up ahead and I'm trying to catch up. I don't know what it was about that experience, but I had a complete break down.\n\nFast forward to sophomore year of high school. Somehow freshman year and the rest of middle school went okay, but it wasn't anything of any importance. My sophomore year I had chemistry class with this one guy, let's call him B, who I guess you could say at the time was \"popular.\" And I got placed in a chemistry group with him and these two other girls. Well, long story short, he heard me talking about League and eventually we got to the point where he asked me if I wanted to play with him and some other guys at school. Of course, I was excited at the simple prospect of having people LOCALLY that I could play with, even if it was just over skype and not at a LAN. \n\nThroughout high school, I envied them because they all played together and got together for LANs and whatnot and I was never invited, even though I played with them nearly every evening. I speculated whether this was because I was the \"weirdo\" at school, or if I was just not close enough to them, etc. But they envied me because I was good at League - maybe not so GREAT, but I was certainly better than all of them. So they would play with me and always tell me how jealous they were and that they wish they could play as well with me. \n\nFast forward to junior year of high school, and it finally happened. Two of the guys, let's call them A and P, invited me to go to Goodwill with them (how sad is it I remember this oh my goodness). I was really excited, etc., and I felt like I finally belonged at LEAST a little bit. From that point on, they all started getting together with me more often, and we would have traditions like playing ultimate frisbee together over the summer at these local tennis courts, and we would get together Monday nights (or whenever it was) to watch every new episode of Walking Dead and eat pizza, etc. And of course, we would play League. Constantly, always together, every night, every day, skipping homework and not doing any after-school clubs/activities so we could play. I remember crying once because I was so happy I had finally found a group of friends that I could enjoy my hobbies with and hang out with, etc.\n\nBut it didn't stop there. By association with them, I suppose, other people started to be more inclined to talk to me too. There were people I had never even DREAMED of speaking to that I became really, really good friends with. I guess you could say I \"rose up the social ladder,\" but that's awfully vain and I never like to think about it that way. In essence, I was really, really happy, and everything at that point in my life was going really well. \n\nAs a result, junior and senior year I had the best experience of my life. Had tons of time just hanging out with my friends, playing League, and doing well in school (of course! haha). My self-confidence shot up, I lost weight, and I started doing better in school. In reality, there could be lots of factors that played into this, but I know the biggest contributor was League, and to this day I am IMMENSELY grateful and happy I found this game. I've been playing almost since it came out, and I have never stopped for more than a few weeks at a time. Thank you, Riot. Thank you, League. Thank you to the world that made all these entities align to make me happy, I am eternally grateful, and will always remember this part of my life for as long as I live. \n\nNow that I'm at college, I don't have a whole lot of time to play League, or well, not nearly as much as I did before. I play a game or three a day, if I get the chance, and I LOVE playing some Azir {{champion:268}}  and some Kalista {{champion:429}}  :) If I'm not trying to advance in rank, I would be playing with my boyfriend who goes to another university about 90 minutes, and it really helps us kind of settle in and focus on destroying summoners on the battlefield, and it's kind of a fun thing to immerse ourselves in and forget the stress and workload of college. \n\nTL;DR: Thank you Riot Games for making such an incredible game and for providing me with the opportunity to connect with other people, and for making such a huge and positive difference/impact in my life. Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, and I love you, and I will continue to support you with my money until the day I'm broke! \n\nCarte Blanche signing off, \n{{champion:17}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fwonk","date":"2015-02-19T21:37:13.837+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was waiting for a ride home after class one night and overheard (more like eavesdropped on) a couple talking about League of Legends.

Almost everyone I've made friends with in college was due to talking about League of Legends or someone noticing my hat.","replies":[]},{"poster":"botty9","date":"2015-02-19T01:23:59.025+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"League made me and my friend closer !D{{champion:157}} ","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bill Stickers","date":"2015-02-19T01:20:00.808+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My best friend and I were thick as thieves in school and card games and league brought us closer together to insanely gay proportions. I don't mean that homophobically, we have gay friends that call us gay. We play league almost every day now spending way to much time together, always helping each other and pulling off crazy plays that happen so organically. It is the equivalent of finishing off eachothers thoughts and sentences; which literally happens sometimes. We have missed tons of skins from gifting each other boxes constantly; seriously Riot, they're OP as fox charms The bromance is so hardcore that without saying a word, we achieved a pentakill with him as Nasus and myself as Braum. Our girlfriends even wonder and worry sometimes it's so bad.\nLoL?\nLots of laughter.\nLots of love.\n\n(I only wish we were that good with our school work lol xD)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Linna Excel","date":"2015-02-19T01:17:06.440+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">It’s essentially a social reset where you’re left to build a whole new group of friends.\n\nMost college friendships end when college does.  The lesson here is to keep in touch with your friends from before college because your new ones are going to move away from you just as you move away from them.\n\nIf you are smart, you'll meet someone who helps you get a job.","replies":[]},{"poster":"alcatrazEscapee","date":"2015-02-19T00:39:05.938+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A lot of people at my school play league, and the fact that I did play league actually helped me bridge the gap between me and those strange video-game addicts over there.\nI (and a few of my specific friends) just love talking about the game, the strategy, the current special game mode, you name it; more than we actually like playing together.","replies":[]}]}
