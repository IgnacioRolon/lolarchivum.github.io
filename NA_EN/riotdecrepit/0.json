In order to get a better idea of who is being affected and how the issue is manifesting, we&#039;re asking for players who began experiencing this issue with the new release to provide the following information (thanks to those who have already provided this info, it helps us out a ton!):\n\n- OSX Version\n- CPU\n- GPU\n- Players who experience this are also reporting issues with the in-game item shop&#039;s textures. If you&#039;re seeing either of these problems, could you clarify whether you&#039;re experiencing shop texture issues, crashes, or both?\n\nAdditionally, if you&#039;ve seen this issue occur specifically in a ranked game with the old HUD, that&#039;d be good to have insight on. Once more I&#039;m very sorry for any trouble that this may cause!\n\n[UPDATE}: We have what we believe to be a fix for both the red textures in the shop and the in-game crashing, so if you're still seeing this issue after updating your client, please let us know and we'll continue to work on getting you back  in the game.

Crashes have happened on the old HUD occasionally, but the main problem has been the notorious freeze screen on death, and EXTREMELY long load times.\n\nThere have been times when I've disconnected, had to reconnect, and have been kicked for being AFK because my load-in time takes so damn long (approx 3-5 minutes for each game, compared to a MAX of one minute that my friends who run the game on PCs sit through). Unrelated, but I've found that I have to keep alt-tabbing into and out of the League of Legends application to have the loading progress. It's really weird, man.\nTo give you an idea on how frequently this happens, I've been LeaverBustered twice now because of this issue.\n\nI know the client's still in beta.

And I'm sure the technical support team is working hard at a fix, but the lack off communication is incredibly infuriating given that this affects such a large portion of the community. There's been no correspondence for over 24 hours from a riot employee on this thread, there's been no discussion of compensation for those that have earned a low priority queue status for their troubles (like myself), and there isn't even a notification in game, or a ranked disabled or anything. Hell, you can disable Darius when he has a small bug, and I'm sure you would've disabled ranked if anyone over level 27 played Darius, but mac users can't even get a notification that if they attempt to play this game, they'll crash, get flamed by their teammates and opponents alike, and receive a low priority queue status.\n\nThough I doubt how much this information really helps given that this seems to be an issue affecting all Macs, here are my specs:\nOSX 10.9.5\nMacbook Pro 2009 15inch\nMemory 4 GB 1067 MHz DDR3\nAnd I am experiencing shop texture problems, and crashes 2 to 4 times a game, occasionally having to restart my computer entirely.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LNC Juanan","date":"2015-07-23T21:08:17.243+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"+1 if u think we are nothing for riot because we are mac users!","replies":[]},{"poster":"A Drowned Fish","date":"2015-07-23T15:31:03.663+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"So since this is going on I haven't played league since the new patch, is it still possible to get the Twisted Fate and/or Graves icon for act I?

But by that time it's like the 4th minute of the game. And before you ask, there's nothing wrong with my connection, I've run tests, I have a low ping and no packet losses and I DID try repairing the client, I even reinstalled the game, didn't work. Rito please...\n\nHere's my specs:\nRunning OSX Yosemite 10.10.3\nMacBook Pro (17-inch, Mid 2009)\nProcessor 2.8 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo\nRAM 8 GB 1067 MHz DDR3\nGraphics NVIDIA GeForce 9600M GT 512 MB","replies":[]},{"poster":"uaKX6ojsNQ","date":"2015-07-24T17:49:23.969+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"THANKS RIOT!!!!! THANK YOU FOR ZE FIX","replies":[]},{"poster":"Artty of Alaska","date":"2015-07-23T18:54:38.867+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"System:\nOSX Yosemite 10.10.4\nMid-2009 MBP 2.66 Ghz Intel Core 2 Duo\n8 GB RAM\nNvidia GeForce 9600M Gt 256 Mb\n\nProblem:\n- Crashes frequently in-game. No discernible pattern or regular frequency. Crashes while playing full-screen causes everything to freeze (ambient audio still plays) and requires manual system reboot. Can't force-quit, CMD-Tab, etc. Crashes while playing windowed mode shut down the game window and bring of the client with the reconnect window displayed, along with a bug-splat. Full functionality of system is restored once game window closes.\n- Red square over item icons in shop. Only exception are the item icons in the recipe section of the shop.\n\nReproduction:\nHaven't tried intentionally reproducing the crash, mostly due to the inconsistency. There seems to be no que or cause. I've played both a normal game and a custom game.\n\nBesides the crashing and red shop windows, gameplay is smooth and responsive.\n\nI can't believe the PBE or internal play tests didn't find this before live release. Is no one at Riot or on PBE playing on Macs? Everything was silky smooth before this update, so what changed? Could the HUD update be responsible?\n\nAnd is there anyone out there on a Mac that ISN'T having this issue?\n\n{{item:3070}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"ohlivia","date":"2015-07-23T17:54:52.521+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"MacBook (mid 2010) OS X Yosesmite 10.10.2\nCPU: 2,4 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo\nGPU: NVIDIA GeForce 320M 256 MB\nAre you experiencing store texture issues, in-game crashes, or both?: Both!\n\nThe shop has a translucent red background, that makes it hard to see the items in the shop (I'm still able to buy them though). ±5 minutes into the game my computer freezes. I can't force the game to quit, move my mouse or anything. I have to restart the entire computer and reconnect to the game. I've tried playing both ARAM and Normals on Summoners, but it's the same on both.","replies":[]}]}
