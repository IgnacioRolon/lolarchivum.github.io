I received a low priority q because I left some games, which I completely agree with and leaving a game is not okay even if you have technical issues. But today while I was waiting for my 20 minutes to be done to get into a match, the lobby for getting into game timed out (60 minute timer). When that happened I finished the leaver timer but because the lobby timed out I had to restart it. Just a small oversight I though would be an easy fix :)","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-28T16:53:19.264+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The LPQ is a great period to work on resolving whatever is causing you to leave games.  It sounds like whatever has been causing you an issue before might still be persisting.  For example, when you enter queue the server needs to group everyone in together but a poor network can cause you to time out or get left behind.  I suggest using our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to fix up whatever is causing this, so you can remain in game and play through those matches.  Let me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]}]}
