Did I really flame that much in this game? The only times I actually flamed (Fiora and Zyra) is because they also flamed me. Yeah ik, shitty excuse. But seriously now... I reported ww.

Since warwick himself kept spamming people to report me. And I really hate the fact that riot focuses more on the toxic part of the community rather than on the troll side.

Riot focuses a lot more on things like hate speech and \"kys\" threats because they are **a lot easier** to pick up on and never really a grey area. \n\nOn the other hand, with \"trollpicking\" or \"inting\", a ton of the instances aren't necessarily trolling or inting. Riot tries their best to defend off meta picks (personally I've played jungle Swain and done fine, not reportable) so when someone picks a character that isn't necessarily the best fit, it's not reportable. It's only reportable in that instance if they INT, which is where I'm getting to next. INTing is running it down lane deliberately to simply feed, racking up scores like 0/22/0 by the end of the game. **The system already automatically detects things like this, and I have seen many instances of people getting banned for this on the spot**. However, doing badly (like 2/14/6) is not INTing because the player is trying. Riot doesn't want to punish a person for being bad at the game, because that would go completely against they're business model as the game makers.\n\nTL;DR Verbal stuff is easy to flag and punish, physical stuff is more of an iffy are sometimes.","replies":[{"poster":"Kąýń","date":"2017-07-06T18:54:43.883+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I actually got banned once for \"intentionally feeding\".
