It came from the heavens themselves onto the heights of Mount Targon, the darkness of the sky replaced with the darkness of its beings, whose eyes gleamed like the stars that once had shone.  All seemed lost.  But it was then that the Solari and Lunari, not yet riven by strife, charged forth from their halls and met the invaders together!\n\nAs legions of terrifying abominations emerged from glowing wounds in a landscape twisted into madness, the defenders strode forward, ranks closed and each aglow with Sun or Moon’s light.  They clashed against the looming darkness, Voidling limbs crashing against their shields and great blows of light battering the shade.  Dauntless, they drove their foe back up the Mountain and into the realm from whence they came.\n\nWe can still see evidence of that battle to this day.  Ancient carvings show Solarian and Lunarian figures standing together against incomprehensible creatures.  Though the Lunari have long ago been exterminated, the example of their forebears outlives them, and the Solari today would do well to heed it should the Void ever come back to Mount Targon.\n\n****\n\nTaliyah hopped off her rock, crossed her arms, and spun about, rising on a column of stone amid the busiest market square in all Shurima.  The sound of churning rock turned the heads of hagglers and merchants alike, who stopped and stared at the stone-weaving girl.\n\n“Hear this!” she cried, “Monsters from between worlds have come to this one.  They mean to _end_ it.”\n\nEyes in the crowd grew wide, and she raised her voice further, “They can hunt any one tribe, defeat any one army, and overrun any one city.  If left alone, they will kill everyone, destroy everything, and turn into _more_ monsters whatever stands in their path.”\n\nChildren clutches their parents’ hands as Taliyah continued, “They have already taken Mount Targon; in just a few months, they will be pounding on the gates of this very city.”\n\nSpreading her arms and regarding one fearful face after another, Taliyah said, “Nomads, Targonians, Shurimans, we must unite.  If we are to live, then every tribe, every army, and every city must come together as one.”\n\n“Legends say that our ancestors faced these monsters—these creatures of the Void—once before.” Taliyah said, the faintest hints of a smile spreading across her face, “The Solari and Lunari joined forces and stopped them at Mount Targon.”\n\n“They lived opposite lives.  They worshipped opposite things.  One day, indeed, they fought until one was wiped out.  But on that day,” said she, raising a finger, “as darkness loomed, the Sun and Moon together cast their light to drive it back!”\n\n“So, as these Voidlings now loom over us,” Taliyah asked, “as before, will you stand against them?”","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hexs Fortune","date":"2018-04-13T00:38:07.567+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Scathlocke,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=K7s5VhUZ,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2018-04-12T21:58:01.285+0000)\n>\n> &quot;That is not dead, which can eternal lie...&quot;\n\nWhat is dead, may never die","replies":[]},{"poster":"UomoAfide","date":"2018-04-12T23:45:49.621+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"And with strange ranked seasons, even Elo may die...\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bomei","date":"2018-04-12T22:22:29.505+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Scathlocke,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=K7s5VhUZ,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2018-04-12T21:58:01.285+0000)\n>\n> &quot;That is not dead, which can eternal lie...&quot;\n\n\"And with strange aeons even death may die.\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"abdollah56273","date":"2018-04-13T19:18:38.062+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's  Lovecraft","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"underscores222","date":"2018-04-13T00:07:42.535+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The void lore confirmed Icathia was under the Shuriman empire at one point (or were threatened by the empire to join or be attacked) and their revolt brought about the destruction of Icathia and opened a rift to the void.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GhaelWinds","date":"2018-04-13T12:19:28.059+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I love Xerath lore but his in game just doesn't seem like it fits.

This Desert Animals fought against the Void in Great Void War and saved the Runeterra. \n\nThe obvious point here is that they're not the only ones capable of that. League doesn't revolve around Shurima. It's a collage of stories with near-unlimited possibilities of world-altering occurences from all over , even by a single individual, not just some dumbasses who fight cuz of their Empire and royal vengeance. Ofcourse Shurima will change the world but you can say that about literally all the regions currently existing, including Bilgewater or Zaun for example, no matter how backwater and meaningless they may seem from afar.\n\nThe Shurima plotline is stuck on Azir vs Xerath right now and neither of them will be mortally dealt with until we have all the lore in place. You're not getting it, simple as that. Just as none of us are getting any meaningful progress in Bilgewater or Targon as the foundations for progress are laid and put on hold.\n\n> Targon is such small faction most of runeterran probably don't even believe they exist.

Targon has sent down 4 aspects as of now and Diana has discovered the Void. Leona is looking for her and it will obviously point to the Void as a greater threat, endangering all of mankind, them with it.\n\nThat's like you saying \"Thor can't have anything to do with Earth because he lives on the other side of the universe on Asgard.\"\n\nAnd then being proven wrong by obvious circumstances.\n\n> Shurima can conquer even Noxus with Sand Soldiers with added human power, and you say me it is not a big conflict. Majestic.\n\nI have no clue as to how you can make that claim considering Noxus' affinity for dark magic and the fact that you don't know it's sheer army size nor what it's comprised of. This fangirling is not even subtle anymore.\n\n> Xerath's goal after defeating Azir is conquering Runeterra but it is lesser conflict than 2 girls' throne fight. \n\nOh good job belittling that, when i don't really care about Sejuani's and Ashe's bickering. They're both tribal leaders, they don't have massive armies backing them. It's Lissandra who is the real threat there, kind of how the White Walkers are. Ashe is fighting for her ideology to bring peace and unite the Freljord, while Sejuani is going for the Noxian ideology of killing all the weak. It's practically subhumanism at it's finest, and there's a literal monster that is worse than her, who wishes to freeze the entire world in ice. Do you think Xerath can match the Watchers? I doubt it.\n\n> Your observation doesn't even know a story called as Bloodline exist. Magnificent.\n\nDo you even speak English? I said based on my observation and you use it in a compeletely broken manner to tie into something absolutely unrelated to the sentence.\n\nBased on my observation on how storytelling works for fuck's sake. There is logically no reason to advance a story that is already developed to an extent that it would rush ahead of other stories, while some haven't even been updated.\n\n> Xerath was about to make the prison actually, but what happened in this case is not known. It was told by Nasus' perspective and he was super injured in this moment. What he only knows after he was saved is, city was completely destroyed.

I haven't read that lore in ages so i'll admit forgetting that, although somewhat justified.\n\n> Freljord was the first retconned faction of lore. Freljord was not the special snowflake of old lore. In old lore, everything was shit.\n\nBut..it was still the most developed faction in the old lore. Like what is your point? Oh, and i don't really care about your opinion on the quality of the old lore.

Because unification makes them more powerfull,  and because people of Shurima would live better as an Empire.

But people of Shurima would likely unite because of the threat of other nations, such as Noxus, and the Void. Plus Azir has basically the biggest army in Shurima  and Nasus, Who is basically a legend and is One of the best commanders in Shurima. Also to One of your previous points about Xerath being no match for the watchers,  keep in mind that Lissandra is not a watcher,  and im pretty confident Xerath could take on ONE watcher, since he is basically a super-ascended. Also the Darkins were defeated by the remaining ascendants after the fall of Shurima.  Guess what Azir and Nasus are.
