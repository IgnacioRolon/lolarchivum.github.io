This way, there is more information the reform system can use to effectively and efficiently deal with negative players. The reporting system takes text from champion select lobby, in-game, and post-game into consideration, so you don't have to worry about that information being left out of the report. \n\nI'm sorry you encountered this negative player, and remember to press the report button for any negative players you encounter in the future! \n\nThanks for your diligence!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dark Morgana","date":"2015-10-28T23:12:52.522+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Fasmodey, \n\nThe best thing you and your team can do is report the negative player at the end of the game. Riot is working on new ways to make sure toxic players like this get punished in chat restrictions. http://riot.com/1OJwJVE This will give you more information and help you understand that your reports on negative behavior are not in vain! \n\n\nKeep up the good work and stay positive. \n\n{{champion:25}} {{summoner:4}} {{item:3157}}","replies":[{"poster":"ValentinPo","date":"2017-07-16T22:19:34.690+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bonjour a vous.
