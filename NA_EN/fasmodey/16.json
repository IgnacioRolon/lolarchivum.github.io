But it doesn&#039;t have to be only one type where 2 individuals love each other in the way that Xayah and Rakan have in their relationship. We have good examples of this, like:\n\n{{champion:103}} x Her lover, which she killed unintentionally\n{{champion:22}} x {{champion:23}} Looks complicated, and we aren&#039;t even sure if it is love or not. But it is complicated.\n{{champion:420}} x {{champion:41}}  They loved and still love each other but they are apart now. It has a unique place in LoL.\n{{champion:55}} x {{champion:86}} They are kinda Xayah and Rakan but seperated by their ideals and countries. Makes them unique.\n\nThen we analyze we see, no champion that loved someone as far as we know in lore is undoubtly evil. Only character I could say evil is Gangplank and even he is nothing compare to our actual evil characters.\n\nAn evil character that has an obsession with only one person in the entire planet is something we lack. Could we have it? I think none of our characters are proper to it. It should be a new character. I wouldn&#039;t like Revenant Mordekaiser to have crush on someone.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Scathlocke","date":"2018-07-02T15:50:25.829+0000","up_votes":75,"down_votes":3,"body":"Vel'Koz loves Teemo.\n\n(That's how you know they're both evil)","replies":[{"poster":"Pale Mask","date":"2018-07-02T16:06:40.525+0000","up_votes":63,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is Vel'Koz engrossed with analyzing Teemo?","replies":[{"poster":"Automated Riven","date":"2018-07-02T16:26:42.563+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why this doesn't have more upvote I don't understand.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rìveń","date":"2018-07-02T19:44:02.316+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You reminded me of this:\n\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/memes/hmqI6Fjd-velkoz-has-become-engrossed-with-anal","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Warlord Rhinark","date":"2018-07-02T16:21:54.589+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Scathlocke,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=mxRE9Z5y,comment-id=000c,timestamp=2018-07-02T15:50:25.829+0000)\n>\n> Vel&#x27;Koz loves Teemo.\n> \n> (That&#x27;s how you know they&#x27;re both evil)\n\nIt's canon now bois.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vhan8765","date":"2018-07-02T16:20:25.538+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can't just drop this on someone without warning! \nI need new trousers now!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"NA Darklarik","date":"2018-07-02T13:46:55.312+0000","up_votes":55,"down_votes":3,"body":"Ummm\n{{champion:142}} {{champion:142}} {{champion:142}} {{champion:142}} {{champion:142}} {{champion:142}} {{champion:142}} {{champion:142}} {{champion:142}} {{champion:142}} {{champion:142}} {{champion:142}} {{champion:142}} {{champion:142}} {{champion:142}} {{champion:142}} {{champion:142}} {{champion:142}} {{champion:142}} {{champion:142}} {{champion:142}} {{champion:142}} {{champion:142}} {{champion:142}} {{champion:142}} {{champion:142}} {{champion:142}} {{champion:142}} {{champion:142}} {{champion:142}} \n\n{{champion:81}} Please save me","replies":[{"poster":"The Soulforged","date":"2018-07-02T16:50:02.805+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"That's not love.","replies":[{"poster":"IcyPepper","date":"2018-07-02T20:46:28.897+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"Whatever you say, Gamora.
