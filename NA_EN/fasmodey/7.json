All other game modes ive played since patch work fine though. The game started fine but then when it would normally load up the game load screen instead the client launcher just says game in progress and then reconnect.\n\nAs far as i know my drivers are up to date. Ill redo the patch once the games over too see if that fixes it. First time having a game continually ask to reconnect without some sort of system error or a bugsplat. Not a big deal for just an Aram but it does suck dissapointing the other people trying to play that game.\n\nNot sure if it matter but i was in the screen editing masteries when the game timer ended.
