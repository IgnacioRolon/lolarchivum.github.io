Actually, even while I&#039;m annoymous he answers a lot of my questions. \n\nBut there is something that I dont understand. This answer is brutal. He literallys say he would fight against both sides. Voidborns and Runeterrans. \n\nThe things are, Void is the biggest threat for Runeterra. If Runeterra falls, you probably have no possible way to clear them from Runeterra again. Even if you could, there wouldn&#039;t be something such as life anymore (except a few Voidborns ofc). There wouldn&#039;t be something to rule, there wouldn&#039;t be something to show your power that highly feeds your ego, which is a perfect pleasure for an arrogant entity like Xerath. Which is what Xerath wants a lot. His literal purpose is getting more and more power + absolute rule. (Ruler of Runeterra)\n\nWhy do I feel like Xerath would make an ally with Runeterrans, at least with such as Noxus, Demacia, Zaun or whatever for a short time? Until they clean the Voidborns? But why would he do that? Most probably because of the things that I said above. Of course totally not with Azir and Nasus, but Xerath is not an entity who could crush anyone he sees. He is not a mindless creature like Rek&#039;Sai. He can talk with you, he can try to use you for his benefits. Examples are followers of Xerath that killed by Nasus.\n\nI just wanna see Xerath in good side for even a short time, even when it is for his benefits. It would be cool and make him totally a grey character, rather than the biggest threat after Void. Really, he is even more dangerous than Shadow Isles in douchebag mode.\n\nSo, what do you think? What would he do in your eyes? What would he become? A total asshole, or a powerful ally? Or goes crazy and figures he can dry out the void energy even while he knows nothing good will come from doing this?","replies":[{"poster":"WAAARGHbobo","date":"2016-05-28T01:16:29.239+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"Keep in mind Xerath will have a character arc, as will Azir, Sivir et al.

Ascension doesn't live in him anymore, it has no mind. Ascension only acts like it has mind when it is in work. While you're about to ascend, your personality (your deep soul or whatever) affects the ritual. Xerath had much more dark side than any other Ascendant, also kept the ritual too far long. That's the reason why he is completely differen than other Ascendants, not because he is keeping his personality in dark side.\n\nIn other say, even if he changed, it would change nothing. \n\nAlso, Guardian of the Sands Xerath has alternative lore. A serious one:\n\n\n_Deep in the sands lies an arcane temple forsaken by a ruined kingdom. Deep in that temple lies an imposing tomb burnished with mystic runes and emerald scarabs. Deep in that tomb lies an ancient being of treacherous power._\n\n_These guys guard the temple next to that one._\n\nToo serious.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Fasmodey","date":"2016-05-28T01:26:03.362+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=WAAARGHbobo,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=0dWJrpAK,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-05-28T01:16:29.239+0000)\n>\n> Keep in mind Xerath will have a character arc, as will Azir, Sivir et al.

And I know a lot fantasy universes...\n\nI'm literally obsessed with his lore, even though his lore changed a lot, he will be always my favourite (at least in LoL). Old or current, it doesn't matter. So, after Shurima Update, I will feel like ''I already ate the topples of pizza, it is turn of crust''.  xD\n\nIt is good to hear that Xerath will have live-action changes though. I believe it is related with Bloodline, isn't it?\n\nI also wanna ask those questions to you that I already edited on the original post.\n\n*So, what do you think? What would he do in your eyes?
