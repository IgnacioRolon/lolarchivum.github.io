Just gets closed.\n\nI will be honest. I had a driver problem today and for 9 hours, add or take, I have worked on it. I'm actually pretty shit at computer so I may fucked up things. And though seems like my primary problem was AMD SATA Controller driver, I wasn't aware of it. For that reason I have updated many drivers. \n\nWhat could be the problem? If it is about drivers (high likely it is), which driver could be the issue? Graphics card driver? I really don't know and I desperately need help, otherwise I may fuck up more.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-21T00:26:51.201+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmmm....it sounds like something may have gone pretty wrong when you were altering those drivers if simply starting League now causes your entire pc to crash.
