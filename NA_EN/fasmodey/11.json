A couple things are holding her back as a champion. \n\nFor starters, the ult range nerf from awhile back is really annoying, but I'd be willing to forgo reverting that in lieu of changing it from a dash to a blink. Dashes can be interrupted by knockups and knockbacks, blinks can't. Staying on the ult, my next change would be to make it so you start with two charges when you level your ult up at 6. I can't tell you how many times I've thought to myself 'yes! I've finally got my ult! I can now stop playing safe and start snowballing!' only to remember that I've only got one charge and that's not nearly enough to kill anyone, so I've gotta wait another minute and a half just to really have my ult. And finally, the E. The damage is alright, but it's still a boring and lackluster ability. I propose tacking on some energy regen or some other added effect to make it better and more exciting.","replies":[{"poster":"AkaIihoIic","date":"2016-02-02T18:15:22.693+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I absolutely agree with you. There are a lot of other champions that can delete you at the right moment they reach lvl 6 (LeBlanc, Diana, Syndra, Zed, Riven, Lux, etc... ) and no need to play those champions perfect for that... It's unfear that u can only snowball with **my lovely Akali** knowing how to play safe and kill in the right time. \n\nMost important thing early-mid game is the double proc, but for that u need at least 2 charges of the ult. So u have to be out of enemy range all the time, losing farm until u reach ur 2nd charge, then bait the enemy's CC, and double proc. Now u have a kill, another charge for killing, and u can push and roam to bot to take 1 or 2 kills or at least 2 assists. Then back, buy, come back to lane and repeat.\n\nWith 1 or 2 ganks of the jg, u can kill ur enemy pre lvl-6 and start snowballing earlier, but not every jungle knows that sadly.\n\nAbout her E, man, looks so out of her kit, it has no synergy with the Q and the R, I just spam it to farm or to last hit champs when Q is on CD and R no charges.\n\nThe energy reg in early with the changes of the Q on the PBE, is awesome. In late u can steal a blue, or just spam Q and R, Q returns Energy and R has no cost.\n\nThe R is a dash and I think it is fear like that, because is not a skillshot, just click and go. It makes u think when u can dash the ADC/MID with no risk to eat all the CC. The changes I would make to the R would be less CD, like Yasuo's E, that would be fear.\n\nThe changes I would make to her Q would be more proyectile speed, its too darn slow. A lot of people say that is helpful for double proc, but its not easy to double proc, and u can use the speed for farming in early, and poke the enemy (almost every mid is ranged). U would still be able to double proc, u would just have to think better.\n\n\n--\n>Kind regards from us. {{champion:134}}{{item:3211}}{{champion:84}}","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"PHoToS999","date":"2016-02-02T09:55:04.363+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:245}} Flashy plays McEkko\n\n{{champion:78}} Destroyer of Worlds","replies":[]},{"poster":"AkaIihoIic","date":"2016-02-02T09:38:01.533+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:84}} FurchiDC's precious ninja.\n{{champion:134}} FurchiDC's lovely dominatrix.\n\nBtw [FurchiDC](https://www.facebook.com/FurchiDECE) is my main account's summoner name, LAS server :3.\n\n--\n>Kind regards from us. {{champion:134}}{{item:3211}}{{champion:84}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheSeltzerBaron","date":"2016-02-02T06:26:37.570+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:223}}  The catfish shark frog\n{{champion:96}}  The void puppy\n{{champion:222}}  The meth addict\n{{champion:17}}  Evil Pikachu\n{{champion:53}} Weird Al Yank a bitch","replies":[]}]}
