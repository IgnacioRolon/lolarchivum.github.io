Call me cheeky, but I had been thinking about it a lot and was just baffled how far off the mark all her skins had felt (except spellthief but the quality/lore tie-in were never that strong). They laughed and showed me what they were working on - I was really excited! It's funny looking back how I entered the interview with a long list of questions about why certain things hadn't been done in LoL and found the answers were, 9 times out of 10, either a) we tried it and it doesn't work for these reasons, b)  we want to do it but it's not a priority for good reasons or c) we are working on it right now!\n\nPart of that surprise is a measure of cautious optimism. For example when embarking on making a whole Star Guardian patch we also have to be mindful that some of Lux's success could be from that feeling of finally having THE skin for Lux and not so much the specific theme itself. It's interesting then to see how it's received on champions like Lulu who fit the theme but aren't so starved for a skin that serves that space. Same with PROJECT; is it really the hypest of hype or would any sci-fi skin on Yasuo have been super popular?
