For the sake of reasonable presentation, I'd imagine super powerful magic entities like Xerath, Nasus, Renekton, Syndra, etc, to be ... I suppose 'dampened', but not meaningfully inhibited. Like fighting a high MR champion before you finished Morello's, or Sorc's+Haunting Guise, if you would. With a bit of effort and time they'll overcome it.\n\nConsider also that Shyvana, a largely magical creature, lives in Demacia without completely killing over from magic negation.\n\nThe main advantage of petricite Demacia is basically it provides a strong shield against 'general' mages and low level magic users. Your token level 1-5 Wizard/Sorcerer/Warlock isn't going to do much, but a level 15-20 is going to go 'lolwut?'.

You could make small deposits of petricite meltdown/explode when overloaded with magic.
