There are only a few who have a Rylai's perma-slow - the DOT crowd (Cass, Malz) and the mega spam crowd (Cass, Eve), with weird ones like Kayle added on because her E is ridiculous. The vast majority of the roster cannot achieve anything close to a perma-slow, and have little use for a permanent slow considering constant application of the slow can burn entire mana pools and for the more bursty character (i.e. the majority of the roster), serves little purpose other than self-peel. I buy it on Syndra when I get a chance and use it only to keep people from chasing me with Qs, which is a pretty healthy use for the investment. Frozen Mallet on the other hand is a genuinely permanent slow, with no concerns such as mana drain, that is bought on a class that INTENDS to do sustained damage as a whole.\n\nRylai's has a few abuse cases on mages who can keep a genuinely permanent slow and have the sustained damage to make use of it, but Frozen Mallet has nothing BUT abuse cases because it's ALWAYS a permanent slow and everyone who buys it has the sustained damage to make use of it.","replies":[{"poster":"Vekkna","date":"2015-08-11T16:09:26.996+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I always want to build Rylai's on {{champion:134}} but I just never seem to get around to it.
