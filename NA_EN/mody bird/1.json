That's an awful idea for her play style.\n\nIf she does get nerfed in a patch soon, then it should have more to do with mana costs. They are pretty low. People are learning how to play against her as well, so next patch seems too soon. I noticed that I don't have as much trouble against her when I face her now as I did a dozen games ago. Some of my friends have only played against her one or two times.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ImSoFull","date":"2015-08-24T05:35:16.429+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"I think higher mana cost and higher cooldowns should do it.

I mean how come they wont at least wait the patch to see how these changes workout. Then they wait not one but two patches to see how fiora pans out. I guess the term \"but LC$BIGPlAY$\" is true, I didn't think so before but there is literally no other reason as champs like Fiora, Xin, and other champs have similar pick and win rates. I mean the hotfix Fiora buff remind me of the time they buffed Nidalee after her rework and didn't give the changes time which led to her being very oppressive to play against for a long time.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"UltÃ®ma","date":"2015-08-24T15:52:30.475+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fiora lover here; I feel as though Fiora, while strong, wouldn't need much to be in a fairly balanced stated.
