Would it not be better that the skin was actually based off the name of the skin? Also the Rakan skin needs some touch ups as most would agree because it looks pathetic in comparison to the other skins that are being released with it. Here you would have the opportunity to make it more focused on light also leading it to go better hand in hand with the name &quot;Cosmic Sun Rakan&quot;.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2017-04-06T17:46:11.619+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"We did toss around the idea of Cosmic Sun and Cosmic Moon, but they aren't Pokémon games, so we opted for something a bit more creative and went with Cosmic Dusk and Cosmic Dawn. \n\n*Seriously, though, we didn't feel that the names sounded as strong, and were a bit too 'to the point'.*","replies":[{"poster":"Ebonmaw Dragon","date":"2017-04-06T18:23:08.974+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot KateyKhaos,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=IgduVyNn,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2017-04-06T17:46:11.619+0000)\n>\n> We did toss around the idea of Cosmic Sun and Cosmic Moon, but they aren&#x27;t Pokémon games\n\nAre you SURE that they arent?\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/mXNYCmw.jpg http://i.imgur.com/y1Y5R3k.jpg","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2017-04-06T19:32:11.913+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh my god, hahaha.","replies":[]},{"poster":"patmax17","date":"2017-04-06T19:46:56.500+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://i.giphy.com/cu5OjF8FxHDSU.gif","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Fishhead734","date":"2017-09-11T18:59:00.269+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot KateyKhaos,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=IgduVyNn,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2017-04-06T17:46:11.619+0000)\n>\n> We did toss around the idea of Cosmic Sun and Cosmic Moon, but they aren&#x27;t Pokémon games, so we opted for something a bit more creative and went with Cosmic Dusk and Cosmic Dawn. \n> \n> *Seriously, though, we didn&#x27;t feel that the names sounded as strong, and were a bit too &#x27;to the point&#x27;.*\n\nI like dusk and dawn far better but I won't buy skins if the dialog for the champ doesn't change it breaks immersion and makes it feel like riots lazy\nBut I love Rakan and Xayah","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Oleandervine","date":"2017-04-05T19:10:27.125+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cosmic Sun and Cosmic Moon don't have the same punch as Cosmic Dusk and Cosmic Dawn.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Blade of Justic","date":"2017-04-06T18:01:30.198+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Now that you mention it, they do kind of remind me of Hou'Yi and Chang'E.\n\nThe Chinese sun and moon god/goddess\n\nhttp://img11.deviantart.net/385c/i/2016/084/4/4/hou_yi_chang_e_by_bluanka-d9wffxc.jpg","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sukishoo","date":"2017-04-05T19:12:14.873+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sun and Moon vs Dusk and Dawn.
