As a zac main, spamming the w key makes it a lot easier and faster to clear the jungle than checking how long until i can cast the spell again, and many other champions have a similar spell on their kit. I&#039;d rather not have a huge headache every time i&#039;m playing one of these champions, so is there any way we could disable that sound, or could it be put back to where it was before? disabling all sounds doesn&#039;t seem like a good option, it helps warn me when an ability is being cast.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Eno","date":"2015-08-04T05:38:33.764+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's turned way down for the upcoming patch - thanks for hanging in there while we're ironing out SFX for the new HUD.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TSE ShadeSlayer","date":"2015-10-25T06:27:50.431+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bump. This is extremely annoying when playing Evelynn. And as was said, many others. It seems like a simple fix to give us the option to remove or lower the sound, so what's the hold up? As a side note I think the best fix for this problem could be to put an on/off button next to where you can choose quick cast for certain abilities and not others. So for instance, with Evelynn i could just take the \"ability not ready yet\" sound off on jusy her \"q\". I'm bumping this every few weeks until we have the option to adjust it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TSE ShadeSlayer","date":"2015-10-25T06:27:21.217+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bump.

Did you guys resolve this issue?  The sound is still extremely loud and pretty much mind numbing on champions like evelynn, where you need to spam in team fights in order to maximize dps. Is there any other option then playing with no sound?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Thresh Outta Fux","date":"2015-08-02T19:45:35.878+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Gonna bump this.
