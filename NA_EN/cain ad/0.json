Being useless early and having to rely on someone else to help you win lane can get annoying but it always paid off when you started getting items. But now with how powerful supports are plus all the new and reworked champs having so much mobility and complex overloaded kits with the ability to unload extreme amounts of damage in a small window . Why is it that ADCs still rely so much on other players while having very basic play pattern. If my role is at the mercy of a support, and dealing with 4 man ganks and dives in lane, and requiring my team to peel for me in fights why isnt adc game impact substantially higher in the later stages. I just think with all the jax,irelia,rengar,etc endlessly diving you in the backlines when i get peels and im able to do damage they should clean house. i recently swapped to top and when i win lane hard or make a nice outplay it just feels better and more impactful. any other adc mains swap to new roles for more rewarding and impactful gameplay ?sorry for the little structure and typos just kind of freeflowed from my phone during lunch.","replies":[{"poster":"Irelia Bot","date":"2019-06-14T21:14:41.968+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"This game has not felt anywhere near as rewarding to play since early to mid season 5.","replies":[]},{"poster":"kda akali","date":"2019-06-14T19:02:16.898+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"adc is very impactful right now. botlane winning or losing can determine the game\n\n> But now with how powerful supports are plus all the new and reworked champs having so much mobility and complex overloaded kits with the ability to unload extreme amounts of damage in a small window\n\nsupports being powerful isn't a bad thing, adc isn't a solo role. the other person should actually have a say in the lane too. the new champions and reworks dont have extreme amounts of damage in a small window \n\n{{champion:350}}: low damage, low mobility\n{{champion:517}}: dps is slower especially after changes, mobility is similar to other skirmishers\n{{champion:518}}: long windup to her burst, e is very easy to dodge, no mobility\n{{champion:555}}: slow telegraphed combo, highest damage dealing ability is very dodge able, mobility simillar/less than other assassins\n{{champion:10}}: very low damage until 16, no mobility\n{{champion:84}}: damage output is slower compared to other assassins, high mobility but its a result of the fact that her burst is less than other assassins\n{{champion:266}}: main damage source is easy to dodge, medium mobility\n{{champion:20}}: low damage, no mobility\n\nsure some of their kits are complex, but that's not really a bad thing\n\n> why isnt adc game impact substantially higher in the later stages\n\nit is, adcs are still the most impactful champions lategame. {{champion:145}} {{champion:67}} {{champion:222}} {{champion:15}} are all extremely good and safe picks","replies":[{"poster":"Cain aD","date":"2019-06-14T19:15:45.350+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"fair points but i also said less rewarding to play. i just dont see a point being at the mercy of others to win my lane anymore because the payoff just isnt there for me anymore. can play a solo lane perform better than my lane opponent and take my lead to impact the other lanes and help invade. adc just feels like it has to jump through too many hoops to get to that point.","replies":[{"poster":"Vustraz","date":"2019-06-14T19:20:58.132+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Support main here, ADC and supports seem to feel the same way toward each other like they are only as good as the other player in the lane and I feel that. What I find helps me with that stress is just queue with a friend playing Jung/top/mid. It sounds strange but hear me out. A top lane friend can TP gank the instant you want them to and mid/jungle can come down to your lane and kill the enemies for you. Plus you can go to their lane and help them if you lanning partner is a bit challnged in the skill department. I find queuing a support/ad duo tends to just make you both tilted. I suggest you try it out because it helped me get outta the hell hole that was bronze.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"CherryBlossomTea","date":"2019-06-15T02:19:04.613+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i disagree!
