I was able to surf the web during this reconnect, so my internet wasn't the issue. \r\nI was carrying my team and got us all of the objectives if you watch the replay. Please, fix your servers and give me my LP gains....","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-12T02:23:58.676+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately, we cannot modify or return LP under any condition. The system was designed this way to prevent abuse of the system.\n\nI wasn't able to find a record of server issues, so I recommend going through our [connection guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to ensure your local settings are compatible with Leauge. If you continue to have issues, we can investigate your route to the server. Let me know the results of those steps!","replies":[]}]}
