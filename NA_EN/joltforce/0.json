Had to restart my computer, and even then for a while the game didnt come back on. \r\n\r\nRight as I am able to reconnect, Lulu reconnects as well, and lo and behold, 2 of our inhibitors are down. Coincidence? I think not.\r\n\r\nNot only did I lose the game, but the amazing LeaverBuster system dished out 5 games of low-priority queue for partaking in &quot;toxic&quot; behavior. Honestly this doesnt make sense to me, if others have the same problem as I do at the very least it shouldn&#039;t be giving penalties and at best it should have been a loss prevented.","replies":[{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2015-04-26T07:43:26.766+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"Have you been having connection problems?
