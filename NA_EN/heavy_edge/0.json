SHi or PD basically comes down to 2 things, 1) Do you have safe wave clear without Shiv? (Mid lane, certain top laners can also be considered for this, example is your mid lane Zed, get Shiv, Orianna, you can go PD) 2) Does your team lack magic damage? If your team is a bit heavy on AD, you may want to go Shiv, it won't add much to make them build a {{item:3102}} but it will add some variety to your teams damage, combined with the fact it can AoE crit, 2.5) Can you afford PD or shiv? This is an odd and not always reliable point, but if you are short the gold for PD, and can afford Shiv, just go shiv, change it out late game if you need to or want to.\n\nI personally have not seen Ghostblade on Vayne, however it comes with the same thought process as twitch, if you are focusing entirely on split pushing and instakilling whoever thinks they can stop you it is a good item. Wouldn't recommend for team fighting though. As  it would remove your defensive item, the full build would be BoRK, Ghostblade, PD, IE, LW and boots, so you technically do more damage but in teamfights you have no ability to survive\n\nShiv and PD is something I believe Gosu does, the reasoning behind it is AS=king for Vayne. Same concept as Ghsotblade though, gives you no defensive item, not something I recommend for anyone learning the champ, because you can and will die very very quickly","replies":[]},{"poster":"A Palmtop Tiger","date":"2015-03-16T18:55:00.275+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Heavy Edge,realm=NA,application-id=WEuoGbmp,discussion-id=tnXnKLo6,comment-id=,timestamp=2015-03-16T18:22:19.811+0000)\n>\n> Can someone explain to me why people go certain item paths with Vayne...\n> Example of builds I see...

Shiv is more useful for split pushing while PD gives more attk speed and crit chance. Oh and also Shiv is easier to build and is cheaper. Personal preference really. Getting 2 attk speed items on Vayne first is pretty standard because of her W passive and her Ult gives inherent AD which makes attk speed more valuable.\n\n3.I dont like this build personally. I find ghostblade not as good on Vayne as compared to other ADCs. I honestly think PD or Shiv is better for her.\n\n4. IE first is a bit unusual now since most Vayne players rush Botrk for dueling potential as well as easier kiting. IE rush however into PD lets you hit for more damage at a certain point.\n\n5. This build is pretty much the same as builds 1+2. You just want a ton of attk speed to kite and get your passive procs. The goal isnt so much as to deal a ton of damage per auto but to deal a ton of damage with your passive. I would only suggest this build is the enemy is not building armor and you find a need to kite certain champions hard.\n\n\n\nRecommend Builds 1 or 2. Also feel free to get the IE b4 the LW if they are not stacking armor if you find yourself not having issues with their frontline.","replies":[]},{"poster":"FHMarshy","date":"2015-03-16T18:29:43.207+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Vayne's W allows her to deal % HP damage every 3rd Auto attack making her Attack speed the prioritized stats to maximize early game. \n\n-> Botrk, PD/Shiv/Ghost Blade\n\nIE/LW are standard DP items that every ADC builds.\n\nShiv deals more Dmg before you get IE. \nPD with the higher chance of Crit would benefit more from IE.
