However I play league way less then I used too, but I just want to talk about a few problems I have with the game and the lame things that have happened and how I just feel like Riot and this game has changed.\n\n\n_Riot_ - Riot is **not an evil** company like how a lot of people make them out to be. But I do think they&#039;re a **stubborn** company.\n  They never do awful things and they&#039;ve never went as low being pay to win or anything that I would really view as greedy.\n**BUT**\nWhen they make a decision they do **not ** care what the community thinks. Here are some examples.\n\n**1.**  The removal of dominion\nRiot removed dominion claiming it was just not worth keeping up anymore, this was a total cop out where what they should of done is just reworked it or made it more appealing, do balance specific changes and make it a good game mode, it was so out dated that it was just dusty.\nWith a yearly income of US**$1.6 billion ** you would think they would have the resources to do this, but I have **never ** in all my years of league ever seen a rioter talk about this, they simply never address the players why they don&#039;t use all that money, because it is just so hard for me to think that they wouldn&#039;t have enough money to do these types of things.\n\n**2.** Only 2 maps\nI just think its crazy that this game only has 2 maps and still makes the money it does, when you think about it, it almost seems like day light robbery. \nIf you look at games like Smite you will see it has an incredible amounts of game modes. Yet it makes **MUCH** less money then league of legends does.\nI don&#039;t know, just imagine if another online multiplayer game came out with only two maps, you probably just wouldn&#039;t bother with it, yet league pulls it off effortlessly \n\n**3.** Removal of seasons\nThis was the lamest thing **EVER!** it seems like the more money Riot made the less they worked, or cared what people even wanted. Everybody loved these seasons, Christmas, Halloween, even an Olympic skin for summoner rift was made. But now, they are simply remnants of the past, lost and forgotten {{champion:111}} .\nRiot said the reason they removed these where because they didn&#039;t have the resources, yet I just wonder how? with the **MASSIVE** $1.6 billion this company makes off **one game** (Any other video game company would be completely jealous of this) , I just cannot understand why this is.\n\n**4.** DYNAMIC QUE\nYes I had to say it, but I won&#039;t really go on about this much because you hear it every day if you go to the boards.\nSimply, riot did not care about what veteran players cared about and will not change their mind and practically don&#039;t acknowledge it.\nPeople are **STILL** asking questions about this but Riot has pulled a famous act of just never replying to any of these concerns, but rather spending their time responding to meme threads and such. They just sometimes genuinely do not care to address players.\n\n**5.** TENCENT\n_ugh_\n\n**6.** Not enough resources\nFor a video game developer making $1.6 billion off one game is insane. So many developers have to pump out games and new content for those games constantly.\nI just feel like riot takes this for granted.\n\n\n\n_Balance_ - Lately I feel like league has been catering to more casual players and making the game less competitive, I&#039;ll also list a few examples here\n\n**1. **Jungle timers\nI hate that you can now just see the enemy buffs timers whenever they want, this took a lot of skill away from jungleing in my opinion, its really self explanatory and if you jungle like me, you will know exactly what I mean. **However** I can see why they did this because a lot of people use stupid third party programs that let them know the exact spawns anyways.\n\n**2.** Range is more powerful then melee\nI know a lot of people are gonna disagree with me here, but I sincerely believe this is an issue. Melee champions are inherently weaker then ranged champions, and this is more true then ever in the late game. There are so many champions that can kite and make melee champions ineffective.\nIt seems the only time melee champions are ever good is when they&#039;re completely busted.\n\nPlaying a melee champ without a gap closer is almost impossible now, there is just way to many kiting mechanics and such that any champ that doesn&#039;t have a gap closer in their kit will just get destroyed against any smart ranged player.\n{{champion:106}} and {{champion:77}} can be strong, but never in lanes unless to directly counter somebody and their only strengths come from their pure ganking power in the jungle. And in the lategame unless very fed will always be outscaled by champions with any reasonable range.\n{{champion:2}}  on the other hand is just notoriously awful\nand {{champion:122}} even with his pull is only good against inexperienced players or for countering a specific champion. This champ is notorious for being bad in professional play and high elo\n\nUNRELATED:  {{champion:77}} I just want to say\n\n**SPIRIT GUARD UDYR SHOULD HAVE BEEN AN UDYR REWORK**\nMaking this an ultimate skin is pretty much forcing players to get this updated model, and riot on purpose will wait as long as they can to visualy update Udyr, and when they do they will PURPOSELY make it not as cool as spirit guard Udyr.\n\n**(3)** Slug balance\nThe balance in league is so so slow, sometimes Riot will just refuse to acknowledge huge problems in the game ( 95% winrate kass, Akali 1v5ing for months on end, Tank Ekko, Tank Fizz ) It will sometimes take them literally **months** to make the simple changes that would put these champions in line. Even when there are literally hundreds of balance suggestions everywhere.\n\n**(4)** Making changes nomatter what\nRiot will be told my hundreds sometimes thousands of people that a certain balance change will totally break something, but Riot will just do it anyways for no apparent reason (TEEMO SHROOMS AFTER PINK WARD REMOVAL NVER FORGET)\n\n\n_LCS_ - Just way too much money is poured into when so much money could be used to give the players much more. I think that League should have the LCS, but they should be less concerned with it.\n\n\nThats my rant","replies":[{"poster":"FastAsHeck","date":"2016-05-26T11:49:02.629+0000","up_votes":51,"down_votes":2,"body":"The only 2 maps thing is kinda mind-blowing...

If you've ever played Smite you will notice that its a much much smaller game that makes much much less money yet still has maybe 5x the content league has.\n\nI wonder where this 1.6 billion dollars goes?

They also have to have servers all over the world to reduce latency, so taxes and rents would vary. You also forgot to factor in redundancy and back up servers. Not to mention the cost of networking and monitoring those servers. These things cost a lot more money than you think.

I&#x27;m afraid the magic is ending and I woulndt like it at all :(\n\nThe 5v5 style of league is its downfall and its strength.\nQue times will always be decent because of it.\n\nYet they will never release great unexplored ideas with such potential like the original 10 vs 10 magma chamber because they are too scared to do anything but stick to the style they took from DOTA of the 3 lane jungle concept.\n\nhttps://i.ytimg.com/vi/-ibk_o4UGGM/maxresdefault.jpg\n\nrip magma chamber concept {{item:3070}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"VentusDragoon","date":"2016-05-27T13:00:47.307+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"1.) You can blame Tencent for a good 80% of this stuff.\n\n2.) There are 3 maps, not two. Yes, HA doesn't have ranked, but it's one of the few places that's generally always \"fun\" like the game should be, instead of frustrating you to the point that you want to cry while the 0/6 Kalista on the enemy team taunts you for losing because her team carried her.\n\n3.) For all the things you named on \"Slug Balance,\" it's more of an overarching problem. Every single one of these problems is caused by Assassins, and honestly I think Riot's going to hold off on anything major with them until they do a class update or something. Assassins with any sort of utility at all (or with any amount of good base damage) will always build tank. However, if you gut their base damages, they may get nerfed so hard that they can't even function normally. (See: S3 Akali to S6 Akali.) The only \"healthy\" assassins are those in game with somewhat limited mobility options and extremely high damages with no resistances. ...So Shaco, pretty much. Kha'zix is another good example. But the problem is, if you make EVERY assassin in the game like that, there's not enough diversity.

Range is more powerful then melee\nI know a lot of people are gonna disagree with me here, but I sincerely believe this is an issue. Melee champions are inherently weaker then ranged champions, and this is more true then ever in the late game. There are so many champions that can kite and make melee champions ineffective.\nIt seems the only time melee champions are ever good is when they're completely busted.\n\nPlaying a melee champ without a gap closer is almost impossible now, there is just way to many kiting mechanics and such that any champ that doesn't have a gap closer in their kit will just get destroyed against any smart ranged player.\nVolibear and Udyr can be strong, but never in lanes unless to directly counter somebody and their only strengths come from their pure ganking power in the jungle. And in the lategame unless very fed will always be outscaled by champions with any reasonable range.\nOlaf on the other hand is just notoriously awful\nand Darius even with his pull is only good against inexperienced players or for countering a specific champion. This champ is notorious for being bad in professional play and high elo.\n\nUNRELATED:  I just want to say Udyr.\n\nRelated, I just want to say Nasus. Darius and Olaf (with recent buffs) shit on Nasus who should be the highest scaling champion in the game. Why? Because they both counter Frozen Heart. Darius does true damage with his ulti, while Olaf's ulti ignored att. speed reduction aura. The latter should make him immune to only to crowd control effects, but somehow the attack speed debuffs became crowd control.

The tank items in this game are way too powerful.  So powerful in fact we have assassins and casters building them out of their insane sustain they provide.  It is not just an AP/AD ratio on abilities problem.  Watch Tank the Leblanc stream.\n\nI tend to agree with you on the maps but they poured too much into the map Summoner's Rift to update the changes to the winter Olympic map and Halloween one.\n\nDynamic Queue needed to happen for the following reasons:\n1.  You had players giving their account information and paying professional players to play their account.\n2.  Solo Queue was NOT really solo queue.  It really pissed me off to hear players on top of paying to play their account were also queuing up with one other professional player to carry that account in a few games to the top.  DUAL queue was allowed in Solo queuing.  It was stupid broken.\n3.  Look around, league takes around 2 minutes to get into a game.  Players are leaving.  And it really is the fact the game is getting out dated.  Yet when you play Urf mode.... games are up in less than 9 seconds.  People are bored of normal slow pace league.\n4.
