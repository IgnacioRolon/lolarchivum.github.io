I wouldn't have my job right now if I hadn't submitted fan-fiction to Games Workshop in like 2010, which ended up with me being published as a writer, then working for them as an editor, and now being here at Riot... :-)\n\nMy advice to you is the same I'd give to anyone. If you want to be a writer, then start writing (and reading!) every day. Read everything you can, fiction and non-fiction, from as many genres and styles as you can. Write anything that you feel inspired to try, and never throw away anything you've written.\n\nLook back at stuff you wrote a week ago, a month ago, whatever. Figure out how to make it better. Re-write it.\n\nWhen you're comfortable with stuff you've written, post it online for comments from other writers and fans. Join writing clubs. Join book clubs. Find your favorite authors, and read everything they've ever published.\n\nIf you decide you'd like to try writing for a living one day, my favorite ever quote/advice about writing comes from Lawrence Kasdan, most famous for his Star Wars work:\n_\"Being a writer is like having homework every night for the rest of your life.\"_\n\nTruth.","replies":[{"poster":"Linna Excel","date":"2018-04-13T17:49:18.452+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Scathlocke,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=qy7yv4GL,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2018-04-12T23:41:01.703+0000)\n>\n>  If you want to be a writer, then _GET AN EDITOR._\n\nFixed it for you.  ;)\n\nFor people getting started an editor just needs to be a second set of eyes.  You don't have to pay a professional or anything like that.  But you do need someone else critiquing you.  Ideally they know the difference between third person limited and third person omniscient, they can tell you that your first sentence or page is weak, they can identify plot holes and pacing issues, etc.  However if all you have is someone who told you that he got bored by the 4th paragraph and stopped reading, that's fine too because you now know your intros are boring.  \n\nGetting better in general requires failing and learning why you failed.  Writers really need that second set of eyes to pick out their failures.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Scathlocke","date":"2018-04-14T05:02:53.031+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is great advice.\n\nIt's also worth getting as many people as you can (whose opinion you trust/value) to read it. Non-writers will give different feedback from writers, League players will have more specific knowledge than non-gamers... and any/all feedback is useful, in that it shows you what a random person WILL think, somewhere out there, even if it was an angle you never, ever would have dreamed of!\n\nBut yes - if you happen to know an editor who owes you a favour or two, rope them in as early as possible ;-)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Blood Magicks","date":"2018-04-13T00:01:33.147+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Scathlocke,\n\nOn the topic of fanfiction rewrites, I've done some solid edits to my contest story, because I really want it to be perfect or at least better than what the word limit allowed it to be.

Narrative Rioters will not generally engage with/read fan-fiction in any official capacity, and certainly won't be able to offer any creative feedback.\n\nI'm not sure about \"can't\" read, but certainly we usually _wouldn't_, unless it was a speculative submission made during an open call for such content (like the recent creative contest) which we were expected to read and assess. But I do think using words like \"steal\" and \"copyright\" gives a rather misleading view of the situation, or anybody's intentions. I don't know where/when the guys talked about fan-fiction, but I imagine they just wanted to keep things simple for everyone involved. :-)","replies":[{"poster":"Dessem","date":"2018-04-14T11:01:00.631+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kinda depressing to think even if we write amazing fanfiction, the writers of the original stuff won't read whatever we write. :(","replies":[]},{"poster":"Battalion","date":"2018-04-14T09:00:49.129+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If we post the story with explicitly stating that we are knowingly and willingly giving full rights to Riot to copy/modify/sell any components of the story and that all characters, based from League of Legends or not, are not our property?
