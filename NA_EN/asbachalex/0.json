For example tristana, janna, xin i blieve were  1350 Be champions.  With shard the upgrade just cost 810 Be. But they are now On Sale for 675 Be. Does this not make you waste the championshard? Wouldn't it be better to have ti with shard even less cost as the normal on sale price (to some equal %) or make it not available/force people to disentchant/activate for 7days/upgrade mastery for the period they are on sale?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-24T03:18:07.118+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Definitely not a trap, as shards are meant to be a way of unlocking champions cheaper than the *normal store price*. If you upgraded a champion that was currently on sale, and you used a shard which cost more than outright buying them, overall it was a decision you made but go ahead and reach out to us in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new). Our billing team might be able to help you out here since you didn't think to check the store first!","replies":[{"poster":"AsbachAlex","date":"2018-01-24T15:30:17.767+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok.
