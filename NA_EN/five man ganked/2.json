It's just something op that was discovered?\n\nDo you know what happened when black cleaver was released?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"SouL1ess","date":"2014-11-29T02:53:44.153+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"> > Because they did not hack....\n> > \n> > It's just something in the game riot didn't think about, and some people discovered.\n> \n> The tiamat glitch dropping games is essentially the same exact thing.\n\nNo, they are entirely two different things.\n\nOne is using an item to provide an advantage that is legitimate within the boundary of the game.\n\nThe other is using an item to cause an error in coding and cause the game to crash. \n\nMaking the game crash is not a part of League of Legends gameplay, just like how Dragon Knight attacking Gem of True Sight on the ground to crash the game for everyone is not a part of DotA gameplay. That is a case of inappropriate coding abuse and has no connection to actual gameplay. \n\nUsing Devourer's enchant and Skirmishers to the best of synergy, while those two items are officially released by Riot (and the players are not liable to use the best winning synergy in a competitive game), is a case of \"abusing\" the best synergy between items and champions. \n\nThe Warwick spamming is, IMO, more comparable to ADCs always building IE. It's their best bet at winning the game, so they do it every game. The influence of such a choice is different, hence why devourer enchant and skirmishers are being nerfed, and warwick reworked.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Droogzy","date":"2014-11-29T01:40:19.535+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I still don't understand while at the least they don't address is more quicker then they are now it's not exactly a secret that this has become incredibly cancerous...being able to effectively one-shot an ADC or APC from full health while not even fed is simply not healthy for the game.\n\nIs it a bug or an exploit? No, but it's about as borderline close to it as it can possibly be.\n\nLeast with Syndra, you can't just click one button and R on a full health person and expect it to kill...Warwick on the other hand, can pretty much do so with two buttons..as a support, its frustrating to watch a Warwick come flying towards your ADC and know there's nothing you can do to stop it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Meep Man","date":"2014-11-29T04:53:46.704+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"How to counter Warwick\n\n{{champion:40}} {{champion:12}} {{champion:9}} {{champion:57}} {{champion:117}} {{champion:80}} {{champion:78}} {{champion:113}} {{champion:98}} {{champion:37}} {{champion:134}} {{champion:44}} {{champion:412}} {{champion:48}} {{champion:4}} {{champion:45}} {{champion:67}} {{champion:161}} {{champion:154}} {{champion:115}} \n\nLearn to Peel","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sukishoo","date":"2014-11-29T02:55:31.297+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I've never heard of an exploit that involves him, I think you cray.","replies":[]}]}
