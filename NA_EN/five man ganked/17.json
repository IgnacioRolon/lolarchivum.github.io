She has %HP true damage, and a low CD dash with an AD steroid for an ult. Champions with this type of kit is usually built to survive to utilize the free damage that is in their kit, so why not Vayne? Vayne's damage with a BotRK stays nearly the same regardless of what you build after that, so why not build her to survive and constantly have Q's up?\r\n\r\nShe has the perfect kit for a ranged bruiser. great mobility, good utility, and free damage in her kit.\r\n\r\n\"but building attack speed and ad does utilize her kit\"... well, not really.\r\n\r\nDo you build Irelia with attack speed? Do you build WW with AP? Do you build Nid glass?","replies":[]}
