Ted will have to essentially play Plat III players in the Gold I promos. He will also have to do this for every other promo series. He is being punished for being a good player.\r\n\r\nOkay, \"so how does this new system work!\" you scream at your monitor.\r\n\r\nWe will take the MMR from the current system, and make it visible... but that is not all! We will rename MMR to ELO and have our shiny rank badges based off this new amazing unit of skill. You typically gain or lose 11 elo per game in a balanced match, true Linear bliss!\r\n\r\nAn example of ranks:\r\nBronze 1200+\r\nSilver 1200-1500\r\nGold 1500-1900\r\nPlatinum 1900-2200\r\nDiamond 2200-2500\r\nMaster 2500+\r\nChallenger (Top 300 ELO)\r\n\r\nWhat could this new system provide?\r\n\r\n* Less stress, due to having no promos\r\n* A more accurate rating, on top of the rank\r\n* You only play people from your current rank\r\n* Your MMR and Rating is locked together\r\n\r\n\"This would never work in a MOBA, that is for chess!\" you shout.\r\nBut it has, and beautifully in the past. League of Legends featured this very system in the height of it's growth in Season 2! Most veteran players (such as myself) prefer this system vastly over the current system.\r\n\r\nWould you like to have an accurate, less stressful, and fair ranking system?\r\nThen let Riot know for Season 5!","replies":[]}
