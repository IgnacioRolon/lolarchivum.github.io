You can check my match history here to account for the games: http://www.lolking.net/summoner/na/60627515#matches\r\n\r\nI did not do anything negative in game, and I did not say anything at all in chat. People are telling me I have just been rebanned for previous games before the initial chat restriction.\r\n\r\nCan I please have the chat logs for both of these restrictions please?\r\n\r\nThank you","replies":[{"poster":"Thats Frosty","date":"2014-11-09T04:16:00.070+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've seen you post this twice now, they do the bans and chat restrictions on a weekly basis. So whatever you got ranked restricted for will not be on your stream, its gonna be something from last week that you did. You're gonna have time to play on the 11th, you're gonna get ranked rewards, suck it up. Others arent getting anything for this season, on top of that, 2 weeks of ban time. Consider yourself lucky","replies":[{"poster":"Five man ganked","date":"2014-11-09T04:22:13.560+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> I've seen you post this twice now, they do the bans and chat restrictions on a weekly basis.
