Homeguard was added in 2012 and the last balancing change to teleport happened in 2014, more than a full year after homeguards were added. The last balance change was made specifically knowing teleport would transfer homeguards and the numbers were fine tuned specifically so it would be balanced in the presence of homeguards.\n\nSo here are the changes to TP since homeguards were released:\n\n-Channel time reduced from 4 to 3.5\n-50 seconds less cdr from cancelling TP\n-60 seconds cdr for TPing to a turret\n\nSo can you tell me which part of these changes were made to \"make up\" for homeguards?\n\nTP overall has been BUFFED since homeguards were released, so what you are saying makes no sense at all.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Old Man Teeto","date":"2015-04-19T19:44:17.455+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Homeguard in general was a \"neat\" idea but bad for the game.\n\nIt's almost *never* used for the situation intended - defending base, and almost always used some high-abuse case (Rammus/Hecarim/Ryze being top three).","replies":[]},{"poster":"arcinex","date":"2015-04-19T18:17:30.503+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I hope it gets nerfed so that homeguard effects stop if you TP.\n\nRight now homeguard + TP on hecarim is complete and utter bullshit.","replies":[]},{"poster":"IziMytTJd7","date":"2015-04-19T20:41:48.781+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well then you have too much faith in Riot's balance team.

There is a reason that tp has a 3 second cast time. The enemy team is meant to have a chance to react. But with homeguards the reaction is meaningless.","replies":[{"poster":"5000000000000000","date":"2015-04-19T20:15:27.212+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Shoot a skillshot where teleport is incoming.
