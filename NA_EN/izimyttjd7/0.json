The absolute percent damage increase, as defined in my original post, peaks (at ~10.7%) when the target has about 120 mr, and then goes down from there.

I'm saying that it has the same exact effect: peel their defenses back. The magnitude is the same as well. Trying to calculate damage versus a tank will always be drastically overpowered when you compare them to the squishy, because... Well. You're comparing a tank to a squishy. \n\nNow, my example was 11.5 hits instead of 13, vs 38.5 hits vs 40. It is true that the fewer hits is more impactful, but you're ignoring the context. Let's use this example, without armor values-\n10 dmg vs 100 hp =  10 hits. -squishy target\n10 dmg vs 300 hp = 30 hits. -tanky target\n30 dmg vs 300 hp = 10 hits (+ 20 dmg, +200 hp)\n30 dmg vs 500 hp = 16.66 hits. (+20 dmg, +200 hp)\nFrom this, we can extrapolate that buying health is WAY more valuable on squishies than tanks, right? That's why buying health on the squishy made him not be any squishier as the game passed, while the tank lost a dramatic amount of hits-to-kill from the same item. This also means that buying damage is purely a tank-busting concept, as squishies can too-easily make it so your damage is useless, right? OF COURSE NOT! I'm taking everything WAY out of context on purpose in this example. \n\n15 pen seems to have less of an effect vs tanks because, well shit, the tank actually has more than 15 mr. It's almost as if, the more tank items someone bought, the more damaging items you need to take them out. A squishy needs less damage to kill them because they bought no tank items, so a small amount of flat pen is enough. It's exactly the same effect, you just need more of it. I'M NOT SAYING FLAT PEN KILLS TANKS, because it's not something you can stack a lot of, but it does EXACTLY the same thing.\n\nIn practice, because percent pen exists, stacking the two IS better than just getting percent, especially versus tanks. This is not a reason to buy a Liandries as a tankbuster item, but it IS good to combine it with void staff if your character can make good use of it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Frius","date":"2017-02-04T20:35:00.849+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:63}} abuser ,permanent burn","replies":[]},{"poster":"KnightsKemplar","date":"2017-02-05T06:27:13.669+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, it's well documented.

Tying the shred to a DoT effect will also ensure that you *don't* get situations where Tank engages with full rotation—>enemies' MR is instantly shredded—>APC one-shots enemy team.\n\nWith this type of design, it'll probably still be a decent pick for DoT mages, but it shouldn't be core on them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Linna Excel","date":"2017-02-05T04:18:21.171+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay at everything, good at nothing, wants you to buy rylai's.\n\n>So in what situation should you buy liandry's?
