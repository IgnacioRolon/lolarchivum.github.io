Many champions have game breaking mechanics. If you wanna remove Akali's true stealth then you should also just remove all these other things to make the game easy. Things being Talon's ability to jump over walls, ASoul's ability to LITTERALLY fly across the map, Tahm's ability to grab an ally against their will and do anything with them, Evelynn's execution AND get away in one button press, Master Yi's stupidity to just have no cooldown on Q and R, Aatrox and Garen to just have \"tons of damage\" no matter how you build them, Neeko's ability to desguise as an ally and actually have an invisible ult, Anivia's egg, Zac's blob, Zilean's ult, Ekko's ult, and many more. THOSE ARE WHAT MAKES THEM UNIQUE. Akali will have NOTHING unique if you remove the true stealth. She will just be another bland champ with a couple dashes and throwing daggers and a little stealth. I'm no Akali main, I barely touch her but I however verse her in lane often and do find frustration versing her BUT THAT'S PART OF THE GAME. Just cuz you have issues with something, doesn't mean it has to be changed. Adapt to it, find a way to make do with what you're given. Avoid Akali. This is a team game and you're giving 4 other people to help you for the next 15+ minutes. No one has to take things on alone. And the ONLY reason Akali mains like Professor Akali wants her reverted is for selfish reasons \"I want people to stop banning her so I can play her again\". They have no issues with the ability itself. These kids need to stop crying about an ablity AND JUST LEARN HOW TO PLAY AGAINST IT. If they decide to quit the game, by all means please do because we don't need that in this game. Tired of people crying \"its broke, fix it\". How 'bout you get good and do something about it yourself. Massive rant but TL:DR, its POINTLESS to remove something that makes a champion unique only because people wanna cry about it.","replies":[{"poster":"Ozzburne","date":"2018-12-20T20:18:47.045+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":5,"body":"use skill shots, hit the skill shots. she takes damage like a piece of paper.
