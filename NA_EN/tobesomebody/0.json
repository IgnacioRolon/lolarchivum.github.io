The 3-unique-hit mechanic for Electrocute and Phase Run is understandable from a design perspective, but it heavily influences the way I try to play or the runes I want to pick now as abilities like Cassiopeia&#039;s fangs or Garen&#039;s spin don&#039;t proc them alone. Grasp&#039;s new health-stack is cool, but it makes me feel more pressure to proc it as often as possible. Weaving in auto attacks is usually a part of gameplay anyway, but now I feel obligated if I take Kleptomancy.\n\nAll of these keystones on top of things like trying to decide which minions are best to dematerialize for this game/champion, desperately trying to stay in range of minions deaths to maximize Overgrowth&#039;s potential, cast my ultimate on cooldown to grab that 15% bonus CDR, sweep every bush in the game to collect every eyeball I can, and dodge/avoid/understand/figure out all of the things the enemy has or is trying to do as well.\n\nI do understand these are just first impressions, and the learning curve is steep for everyone, but thus far I fall heavily to either side of ignoring new runes completely, or focusing more on them than I am the game I&#039;m playing.","replies":[{"poster":"DuskDaUmbreon","date":"2017-11-08T19:36:12.019+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I enjoy having the mini games.

It is multi hit things like karth E or swain R or morg  W that were nerfed.","replies":[{"poster":"ToBeSomebody","date":"2017-11-08T16:33:42.790+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":6,"body":"The wording is pretty clear on the rune, stating they have to be separate abilities/attacks. The fangs and the spin can't proc them alone. For Cass that means weaving in an auto attack despite fangs being faster, or they're already taking damage from miasma as well (all of this assuming you landed a Q)","replies":[{"poster":"Kloqdq","date":"2017-11-08T17:06:52.193+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"The separate abilities/attacks just means stuff like dots or ticks do not proc it. Morgana pool or Cass's poison will not proc electrocute or phase but Twin Fang, Auto-attacks, etc will. The source of damage just needs to be new, not a unique one.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"deadlychuck","date":"2017-11-08T23:42:07.310+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's like WoW talent changes all over again!

It should trigger off of hitting three separate ability casts.\n\nAnways, Comet seems like it would be the better option for her, because you can reduce its cooldown by hitting enemies with abilities, which synergizes extremely well with her machinegun playstyle. (URF Comet Cassio is going to be insane lmao)\n\nGaren's options for damage runes aren't great though, which is kind of sad.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ChefZakarian","date":"2017-11-08T19:58:29.139+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"New runes suck. convoluted mess and like you said every one is like some BS minigame to proc it or meet some condition. I miss just picking basic runes that enhanced my spells or auto and played my champion like a normal person. also get a strong feeling these runes help very specific champions more then others. which is based on the notion of \"more complex\" = \"more niche\" type skill sets.","replies":[]}]}
