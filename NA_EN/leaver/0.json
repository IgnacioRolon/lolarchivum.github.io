In Legend of the Poro King if you accidentally dodge by failing to ban or pick in time you still get a 15 minute timer which seems harsh given that it is an accidental dodge. Also you lose your ARAM rerolls despite them having nothing to do with the mode.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-18T03:46:45.677+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I know it kinda sucks, but you still need to lock in your champ once you've decided in every game mode. ARAM's don't require you to lock in since the champ is chosen for you, but I wouldn't bank on the lobby auto locking me in to personally make sure I avoid any dodges.","replies":[]}]}
