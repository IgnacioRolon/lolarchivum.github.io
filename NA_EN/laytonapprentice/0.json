Bladesnare","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Gameplay+","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pickaxe (875g) + Brawler&#039;s gloves (400g) + Vampiric Scepter (900g) + 525g = Bladesnare (2800g)\r\n\r\n35 attack damage\r\n10% lifesteal\r\n25% crit\r\n\r\nActive: Places a Steadfast Ward. Steadfast Ward has a 3 second arming time. Steadfast Ward has 2 hp. Steadfast Ward can block dashes passing through its area at the cost of 1 hp. Enemies in the Steadfast Ward&#039;s area are grounded. Steadfast ward lasts 12 seconds. (60 second cooldown)\r\n\r\nThe idea is a powerful item that rewards the player for predicting fights and preparing themselves a safe area to kite enemies.  When placed incorrectly it is quickly destroyed or ignored, but when done correctly allows you to keep foes at bay.\r\n\r\n-The base stats are invaluable to marksmen who usually get jumped on early in the fight.\r\n-Requires you to place the ward 3 seconds before getting jumped.\r\n-Placing the ward too soon will allow enemies to wait out the duration.\r\n-Ward can easily be destroyed by anyone with ranged attacks.\r\n-A great item to build when behind (Low Cost of components and combination)!\r\n-Let&#039;s you get some damage out in an extremely tough game where your enemy has heavy mobility.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy not give the item stats for mages/supports/tanks?\r\n-These champions already have kits that are good for locking down enemies. They don&#039;t need more of it. If the item&#039;s base stats allowed anyone to build it, then there would be 4-5 of these wards in a single fight.\r\n-While you could build the item on someone like Tryndamere or Yi, these champions want their targets in melee range and kill them before the 3 second arming time anyways. So the item couldn&#039;t be used to prevent someone&#039;s escape very effectively.\r\n\r\nI personally feel this item would be very useful in solo queue meta, and rewards good players while giving adequate drawbacks that allow the enemy to play around it.\r\n\r\nThis is my reasoning behind the item, but I would love to hear other people&#039;s ideas on what the base stats should be, whether or not this item would be oppressive or extremely invaluable in the current meta, and whether or not it would be highly abusable.","replies":[{"poster":"KnightsKemplar","date":"2018-10-04T03:26:41.388+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Approved!","replies":[]},{"poster":"PandaNator43","date":"2018-10-04T17:31:01.671+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Interesting item. I like the the idea of letting Marksmen be a little more self-sufficient: it sucks to have a team that doesn't know how to peel, or to have champ select losses when your team has no peel and the enemy is full of divers. \n\nGiving the grounded active to a cheap item is really dangerous. Not letting other champs use their abilities creates a lot of unfun, and putting this effect on an item would make it prevalent in a lot of games. Currently the grounded mechanic is really only on Cass, and Poppy (I'm probably forgetting some.), and their ability effects only has a short time, as opposed to a long last ward. \n\nAlso, my assumption is that this \"playmaking\" would look like the the marksman standing still, unreachable by the enemy team, and right clicking on everyone, which I find really uninteresting. Reminds me of the burst ADC meta early this year. \n\nDo you have any ideas to give the marksman some self sufficient peel without directly invalidating other champion abilities?","replies":[{"poster":"Ulanopo","date":"2018-10-04T18:08:59.942+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had many of the same concerns. \n\nI would also add that it might be better for this to be a class-agnostic utility item, as ADCs already occupy a tremendous amount of design space. The opportunity cost for self-peel might have to be an otherwise sub-optimal item.","replies":[{"poster":"PandaNator43","date":"2018-10-04T18:54:20.764+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> ADCs already occupy a tremendous amount of design space\n\nI'm not sure I follow this, can you elaborate? IMO ADCs are the most homogeneous class (although that may not be mutually exclusive with what you are saying).","replies":[{"poster":"Ulanopo","date":"2018-10-04T18:58:23.229+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Perhaps it would be more clear if I said \"ADCs have access to the greatest amount of item design space\", by which I mean that they have the largest spread of item abilities. I assume part of this is to help increase differentiation between auto-attackers, but that ignores all the other things ADCs are doing when not auto-attacking.","replies":[{"poster":"PandaNator43","date":"2018-10-04T19:10:52.387+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yep, that makes more sense :) agreed.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"hsumis1ove","date":"2018-11-04T03:06:35.560+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Looks like a really strong Vayne counter.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2018-10-05T19:14:58.734+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"That mechanic is so strong that an item with it would have to have absolutely garbage numbers (duration, stats, cost, etc.).

This is all disregarding the fact that both life steal and crit on the same item is a little too big. it might have gone unnoticed, but bork bt and L:bloodline are the only direct \"Lifesteal\" Items. yeah there is deaths dance, but thats more of a caster item. immediately off the top of my head, lucian, vayne, jhin, graves, and xayah would hit a huge power spike with just a bladesnare and storm razor. Both cheap. or if they are ahead then a snare and ie.

Or is it a late game pick up? \n\nIf its rushed it would put you at a pretty big disadvantage between picking up spike items.\n\nIf you get it late is it worth getting this over a % Armor pen item or GA?\n\nI dont see a reason to get this at a point where pink wards and sweepers should be more prevelent late game. \n\nIs this for someone who would make a weird build path like bork, this item and then infinity edge?\n\nDecent AD, good lifesteal, and 50% crit. very awkward stats but it is kinda cheap.\n\nOverall the components to this item are easier to pick up and flexible, while the item is cheap... \nHowever, i dont think itll be worth it unless the blade stats are over tuned and at that point the active would be negligable as to why you wanna get this; even with the build path being alright. \n\nLifesteal and crit are separately problematic stats as well so that can also lead to being a problematic item.","replies":[]}]}
