There's no good reason to use it, even if you're trying to tell someone not to use it.\n\nHow is it _unfair_ that you got punished for something _you explicitly knew not to do?_\n\n> And no it is not my ignorance it is yours about what justice is ...\n\nTo start with, you should probably consider toning down a bit. You've insulted others in this thread, and this line (although mine, with or without context, is not much better) is toeing the line of an insult.\n\nBeyond that, I'm not ignorant to what justice is. Your case is an edge one, and like R107 Games said, you should contact Support. _That said_, your combative nature in this thread is giving me less reason to want to help you. You may have been punished wrongfully, but _insulting others won't help you get that punishment reverted._\n\nAnd, yes, this is a case of your ignorance. You specifically stated that you were unaware that the IFS monitors post-game chat (albeit it's been a function for a while now, I think it started around May 2018?). However, being unaware of where the rules extend to, as I've stated, is not an excuse for breaking the rules.\n\n> And how riot love trolls??? Simple if I want to get someone banned I just bait him to use some word and he get ban even he is not toxic but I want to troll ....It is simple as that....Get it now specialist????\n\nHere's the thing; baiting zero-tolerance chat is harder than you make it out to be. Very few people are actually gullible enough to fall for that. And even still, if someone got baited into saying something zero-tolerance, and they reach out to Riot about it, _Riot will generally revert the ban._\n\nAdd to that the fact that Riot also punishes people who try to bait ZT chat or instigate conflict, and I have a hard time seeing the foundation for your claims that \"Riot loves trolls\" as valid.","replies":[{"poster":"Vegito101","date":"2019-01-14T21:38:48.039+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"first .People who blindly fallow rules without questioning logic behind  them are slaves .If some rule is illogical u go and try to make people realize it so that it can be changed...\n Second I said this couple of times here  I did not know that post game chat is monitored,I would not use it if i knew...but that is not a point... \n Third I am not going to beg anyone  for justice   \nFourth I wroth a ticket and they give me blitz bot 5 times regardless what i say...So  I came to conclusion that they have no time or don't care about players...

There's no good reason to say \"kys\" in League. Edge cases like yours are _exceptionally rare_, and 98% of the time (even that might be generous), \"kys\" will only ever be used as an encouragement of self-harm.\n\n> Second I said this couple of times here I did not know that post game chat is monitored,I would not use it if i knew...but that is not a point...\n\n\"A\" point, or \"the\" point? Either way, it's something you should take note of going forward. The IFS scans pre-game, in-game, and post-game chat logs during a review, so, you should take your own advice and not say \"kys\" ever.\n\n> Fourth I wroth a ticket and they give me blitz bot 5 times regardless what i say...So I came to conclusion that they have no time or don't care about players... Which would make me angry ,but for some reason it was what i expected\n\nI don't know much about Riot Support protocols, but I've personally never received Blitzcrank Bot in the few Support Tickets I've made (claiming Riot Girl Tristana/Unchained Alistar notwithstanding). I'm not sure if it's an error in your tickets (how you're approaching it, attitude, etc.) or if there aren't many active Support Agents right now, but, as it stands, Riot Support is still your only avenue for getting the punishment overturned.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"rujitra","date":"2019-01-14T21:01:54.852+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why are you repeating something you know “trigger autobahn siystem”?\n\nYou may be able to get this reduced to a chat restriction if you are nice to support, not demanding, and ask nicely.
