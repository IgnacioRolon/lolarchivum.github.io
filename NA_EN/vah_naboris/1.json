Since i've stopped playing i no longer deal with anger management issues and i've been actively trying out new games many of which i've taken a liking to and started playing on a regular basis. League of legends will always hold a special place in my heart but with all the gameplay changes and the lack of true moderation the game has lost its luster to me and many others. I'm glad you still enjoy the game but i can't deal with the constant harassment from the community anymore nor can i deal with the poor balancing done by the \"Gameplay\" team.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Marshbouy","date":"2018-08-16T01:09:11.365+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"the bardle royale event in Nexus Blitz (new gamemode)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"YuGiHo","date":"2018-08-16T04:07:37.743+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yea this keeps happening to me.  not cool.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Binding Eclipse","date":"2018-08-16T01:40:57.834+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had a game where the center point wasn't even on the map, and an afk on the enemy team got credited with a pentakill when we all died\n\nx)","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-08-16T01:05:56.608+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I got to see a KotH point on top of the enemy nexus earlier.\n\nThey all sat on it and captured it while we took three towers and won.","replies":[]}]}
