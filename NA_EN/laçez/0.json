It is usually againsts your favour due to the mid lane being full of ranged mages. In melee matchups things tend to be better if your not up against a counter, e.g Kassadin. He lacks poke as a result of everything being centred around his passive &amp; he doesn&#039;t have early damage. Engaging on a target is fairly telegraphed since his only gap closer is his E &amp; nothing else, this is usually the way you trade but since he&#039;s melee, in ranged matchups you tend to lose out due to creeps switching aggro, his low base damage not being worth trading for &amp; high mana costs which leave you with little pressure for future trades. The way his trades are set up cause him to be very susceptible to CC, of which he has no form of disengage aside from his R upon hitting 6. Just for comparison I&#039;ll highlight other melee midlane assassins, so you can see what I mean.\r\n{{champion:238}}:  Has W &amp; Q for poke in lane along with his E for slows providing better chances of hitting those Qs.

Good base damage given the poke he has.\r\n{{champion:84}}: Q decent poke, makes up for the lack of damage &amp; the melee midlane dilemma with sustain, W as broken as it is, provides her with pressure &amp; minimises her damage taken in lane while also being used as a pseudo-engage in laning phase for trading. Passive - no cd &amp; hybrid scaling, has two iterations of increased Ms for her &amp; bonus + damage range on her next AA.

In their cases you aren&#039;t required to engage everytime to deal damage or for Akali her shroud is what makes her trading worth it. Even so their engaging is quite versatile &amp; not necessarily telegraphed. For the ones that do engage head on, Talon, Diana &amp; Fizz, their damage is what gives reason for their trades &amp; again on top of that Diana has a shield &amp; Fizz has his E which literally dodges everything in the game (if they opt out using it for the damage). Ekko&#039;s trades play out as I&#039;ve mentioned earlier, sub-par damage, telegraphged, no follow up due to his 5 second cd on his passive or decent form of disengage (of which used to be his slow). Even if you have high cdr your standalone spells have nothing going for them. The Q doesn&#039;t deal damage &amp; even where it does the most damage (winding back to him), it rarely hits. The Same goes for the E but I&#039;m okay with that. In lane you can hear the W being cast so you know he&#039;s going to engage &amp; in a 1v1 scenario you either use it early for the shield or later as a stun which most people can discern where it&#039;ll land. His R can&#039;t be used as an engage tool, unless you&#039;ve just traded &amp; you&#039;re looking to go back in within 4 seconds. Why is that a bad Idea? You&#039;re passive is still on cd, you lose any form of disengage &amp; you lose your heal. In Earlier stages of the game where scaling is low it isn&#039;t worth using because of the lack of follow up if your target isn&#039;t already low. I&#039;ve found it very frustrating being ahead like 6 - 0 but being limited because my passive is my only real source of damage, a lot of the time you can get an opposing laner low, while being fed but have them just last hit stuck to their tower because of the instant pressure you lose having all your damage emphised on your passive, making Ekko unreliable at closing out kills. So you are faced with three choices: \r\n1. Use your Q to push in the wave and force them to not recall, losing quite a lot of mana as a result &amp; leaving you open to ganks.\r\n2. Let them back, push in &amp; roam, if roaming options are available.\r\n3. You dive them &amp; you usually don&#039;t do that unless your ult is up.\r\n\r\nI have performed really well as Ekko but I feel it is mainly due to dumb mistakes on the enemy team allowing that time &amp; time again, I&#039;ve seen with success in him in pro play, which is why I think Riot don&#039;t really want to experiment with him (along with higher priority pending updates). Listen I don&#039;t want Ekko to be broken, I just want more of a reason to feel satisfied while playing him, as in you do well, you feel rewarded. There are tanks that can achieve this without even doing anything. \r\n\r\nI do wanna have a bit of a debate in the comments &amp; further my reasoning on him based on what you all might have to say...","replies":[{"poster":"Infernape","date":"2019-01-14T02:55:01.098+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because most of Ekko's damage comes from items like Lich.

His Q bothers me for offense as its distance is so heavily affected by hitting just 1 champion that even if the enemy team was standing on top of one another you might not hit all of them with it. Anyway Ekko's Fighting style is something I fell in love with a long time ago. With his passive you have the ability to go in and either A kill an Enemy or B do a good chunk of damage and then retreat (tactically of course) and wait for CD and reset on his passive to go in again. He is not someone who you can just stand there attack you have to use that movement speed from the passive and set up for your next move, and that is what makes Ekko so great if you know how to play him. Always setting up for that next move to give you or your team the best advantage to win.","replies":[{"poster":"Laçez","date":"2019-01-16T16:00:00.384+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thing is, that is exactly how I play him & his playstyle is too heavily reliant on his passive to the point where it is his only viable way of closing out kills. It would be cool if they did something where his Q sped up briefly at the point of contact with a champion & maybe wind back faster too only in that instance, otherwise have it function the way it does currently if a champion isn't hit, but it doesn't. I'm sure you've found it that a lot of times your Q doesn't even provide the slow it should because the slow is effective in a field & as such is very hit & miss. Aside from waveclear & for applying stacks of his passive I otherwise find his Q quite useless.\n\nThere was a reason people started playing tank Ekko & that was because as an assassin or skirmisher, he really didn't perform & you could just get more success in playing him as a utility tank because of the slow & his ult. Unlike real skirmishers such as Yasuo, he really doesn't win prolongued fights because his animations are too long & the of the stark focus on his passive being the thing that does damage reliably. You can only really engage in one fashion & that's his E, as you can't do it with your ult in most scenarios & because of his lack of poke, a champion can play safe & feel no presence of pressure from Ekko. I've often thought to myself (because I don't play ranked), that Ekko can only really be played up until a certain point where players begin to play noticeably better, usually diamond & above. At this point players don't allow themselves to make frequent mistakes - positioning, wave control, not warding or pinging, objective priority etc. & also they don't allow themselves to be hit by abilities like Ekko's Q on return or his W, as they retain better attention to their opposing laners. At this point your abilities begin to have greater diminishing value & what he's left with that can really help is his passive which is on a 5 second cd & his ult that you can't initiate or reliably deal damage with.  In the time it takes to react to an engage or being in a fight, having a passive that important on a cd of 5 seconds, paired with a Q & W that don't deal any sort of damage on their own, let alone even hit their target, makes him a pretty bad skirmisher, if that's what people are so content with him being categorised as. A such I've noticed that Ekko only really shines when opponents don't really know what they're doing & give you the upper hand, leading me to believe that skill on Ekko can only take you so far before Ekko as a champion begins to fail the player itself. \n\nI've heard time & time again that Ekko's lack of DPS is in favor of his utility & late game potential, along with surviveability, but it's clear to see that his utility even in wave clear from his Q isn't anything to boast about. He has a shield from his W that takes 3 seconds to activate & if it does stun, then it only does so for 1.75 seconds compared to the 2.25 prior to the nerf. I will say his split push power is definately really good, but that's the only silver lining I've found. His late game doesn't even give me a reason to play him as, in all honesty, it isn't great. In diamond+ his late game WR dips at around 28 minutes and barely climbs up to 50% at 40 minutes, at which point it dips further beyond that point. His win rate only sits at <50 in the time of 12 - 28 minutes. Obviously these are avrerages of all games but, I've noticed that assassins that have far more pressure, damage & early game win rates, perform more consistently, if not better at later stages of the game than Ekko does. This goes for Zed, Fizz, Leblanc,**even ** Talon & Katarina. If Ekko's late game is all the rage about why his lacks in other areas, why is it sub-par to his assassin counterparts who again, have far more success in the earlier stages of the game?
