She went from being a powerhouse to nothing in a few patches. In season 3 Elise used to be able to gank early, snowball her team and get objectives. Now Elise trys to gank a lane, whiffs her tiny hitbox 1 second stun, and walks back into the jungle like no one saw it. The only thing that hasn't really changed about Elise is her clear early game, her spiderlings are amazing for early clear and she takes no damage from jungle monsters if you use her spiderlings right, but like I said before, missing your 1 second stun really makes her harder to do anything with. Even if you do hit your stun, its only 1 second early game and people usually max it last on her. She did get some cooldown buffs but that didn't really balance out anything. Elise can still deal a lot of damage if you build her somewhat AP so thats nothing to worry about, but its just mostly both E ranges on her that got nerfed a little too hard. I used to main Elise in season 3 and now its hard to play her without feeling like I can't do anything all game.\r\n\r\nPlease tell me if you agree/disagree in the comments but this is my thought on Elise and how she stands.  {{champion:60}} \r\n\r\n-Mafia Jinx","replies":[{"poster":"Knight SoIaire ","date":"2015-01-11T14:25:40.205+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":5,"body":"> The nerfs that Riot had made to Elise in patch 4.13 and 4.4 made her really weak\n\nseriously? i didnt notice in the storm of other ppl posting it and EVEN REDS STATING THAT ELISE IS OVERNERFED BECAUSE SHE CAN BECOME A SECOND LEE SIN","replies":[{"poster":"Zahz","date":"2015-01-11T14:32:40.246+0000","up_votes":32,"down_votes":2,"body":"lol wish they had that attitude when it comes to the real lee sin","replies":[{"poster":"OyddAWqJ5r","date":"2015-01-11T21:18:20.981+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot mentality: Noone can be as strong as Lee Sin.

Elise does a flat 8% of current health on Neurotoxin, and 8% missing health on Venomous Bite. Elise's abilities add 3% per *100* AP.\n\nNeurotoxin is great against someone with a shitton of health, but (completely ignoring the ability to cast Sonic Wave and Resonating Strike back to back) Resonating Strike alone will always do more damage than Venomous Bite thanks to the former's scaling. Elise's Q also has a maximum damage limit against monsters, while Lee Sin's does not.\n\n**Gapclosers:** Lee Sin has Resonating Strike, which can be used from an extremely long range (it and Sonic Wave can be cast from further away than *any* of Elise's abilities). If Lee goes in on Resonating Strike, he can E2 and slow his target more than enough to get everything else off. Safeguard works on anything classified as an ally from 700 range, allowing for effective walljumps with wards and quite literally anything your team leaves lying around. He can jump to allied Teemo shrooms.\n\nVenomous Bite (Elise's first gapcloser) has 475 range. That's less than Lucian's attack range. She also has no followup CC unless she immediately swaps back to Human Form for a point-blank Cocoon. Rappel only works on enemy targets. Put simply, Elise can't escape; she only has an in.\n\n**Heals:** Elise's heal? 4 flat + 4% AP per autoattack or Spiderling attack that lasts for three seconds. Along with her Q's equally shit scaling with nothing to make up for it besides her Human!W (which has a 12 second cooldown and isn't exactly the easiest thing to land, so it's just used for scouting more than anything), Elise has more than enough cause to never build AP. Magic penetration is the only thing she has going for her, but her base damage is pretty shit, too.\n\nLee Sin gets a flat 25% lifesteal and spellvamp for four seconds. This adds on to the very common  and recommended build of a Ravenous Hydra, adding an extra 12% lifesteal, and even an extra 20% (57% total in lifesteal if you're keeping up on the math) from a Bloodthirster if you're fed out the ass. Lee Sin can afford to do this because his scaling and innate survivability is amazing as balls.\n\nSpellvamp applies to Smite, meaning Lee can W2 and smite literally any monster or minion at level 18 and get 250 health back in an instant. This is on top of Sonic Wave, Resonating Strike and his ultimate, all of which count as single-target spells and therefore apply full spellvamp.\n\n**CC:** Elise's only CC is in the form of a *non-damaging* skillshot the width of Nidalee's spear that lasts two seconds at max rank. Lee Sin not only has a slow and *true sight* in Tempest, which he can double-cast immediately after going in on Resonating Strike, but his ultimate is a second-long targeted knockback with a 200% bonus AD ratio. If he kicks his target into more enemies, they take the *same damage*. Significantly more play potential can be made from Dragon's Rage as well, compared to Elise's wimpy-as-shit stun.\n\nDue to the massive disparity between their skillsets, even while regarding cooldowns, I can almost guarantee that you're much more likely to get more Lee ults in than you are Elise stuns.\n\n***tl;dr*** Elise is overnerfed shit, through and through, and Lee is overloaded and overpowered.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Abyssphere","date":"2015-01-11T15:42:45.232+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Hagane No Arashi,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=kIFsbdgx,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2015-01-11T14:25:40.205+0000)\n>\n> seriously? i didnt notice in the storm of other ppl posting it and EVEN REDS STATING THAT ELISE IS OVERNERFED BECAUSE SHE CAN BECOME A SECOND LEE SIN\n\nSo Lee Sin is allowed to be Lee Sin but Elise must be unplayable?","replies":[{"poster":"Knight SoIaire ","date":"2015-01-11T15:55:59.096+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":14,"body":"le is already there and he isnt such an offender as elise (elise was doing everything basing on her ites , lee does everything only in lcs) \n\nbesides that lee is prolly getting a rework too","replies":[{"poster":"Direwolfiez","date":"2015-01-11T22:36:22.122+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow, Lee is unplayable?

Without an assassin on your team, squishies on the enemy team would just walk all over you because the junglers got nerfed.\n\nElise right now is on the border of being playable in the Jungle because she can have her spiderlings tank for her. Most pros know that if Riot ends up nerfing the Jungle soon, or buffing Junglers, or adding a second Jungling item to the game (everyone and their dog uses stalker only because none of the other enchants work near as well and they nerfed the crap out of the trailblazer), or doing any number of other things to make junglers' lives easier, Elise has the potential to explode in power.

Rappel also no longer allows Elise to travel outside of the indicated range.\n\nContext: Elise has been a high-value pick in competitive play for some time thanks to the overall strength of her kit. We considered reducing the damage of some of her abilities, but felt like we should target her more frustrating aspects first. Specifically, we wanted to reduce the tankiness of Elise's spiderlings and lower their utility as damage sponges. With these changes we can add a little more counterplay for her opponents, meaning Elise players will need to think more carefully about her Spider Swarm passive.\n\nThe other ability we targeted was the deceptively long range of Rappel. We initially designed Elise's Rappel to allow for some extra travel space outside of her indicated range, but in retrospect this made the skill extremely frustrating to play against. These changes mean the circular visual indicator will more accurately show who Elise is able to descend upon.\n\nSpiderlings\nHealth reduced to 90-260 from 125-550\nArmor increased to 30/50/70/90 from 30 (based on Spider Form rank)\nMagic Resist increased to 50/70/90/110 from 50 (based on Spider Form rank)\nMulti-target damage reduction adjusted to 25% from 10/20/30/40%\nSpiderlings no longer continue taking actions before vanishing once Elise shifts into Human Form\nSpiderlings now group closer together while moving\nVolatile Spiderling\nMovement Speed has been reduced\nRappel\nElise can no longer descend outside of the indicated area\nFixed a bug where Elise could begin casting spells and attacking as soon as she began her descent while she was still untargetable\nSpiderlings will now descend from Rappel slightly after Elise instead of descending at the same time\n\nv4.2\n\nSpiderForm.png R - Spider Form\nCOLLISION SIZE :: Fixed a bug where Elise's spider form size was smaller than intended for gameplay collision purposes.\n\nv4.4 (Lowered damage against monsters, and made several changes to hurt her early game for small buffs late game. Seeing as she is meant to be an early game jungler meant to help her team snowball, this contradicts that they want to emphasize \"Champions having specific strengths and weaknesses.\")\n\n\"Reiterating what was mentioned in the foreword of the patch notes, we like champions that have different strengths and weaknesses at various points in the game, but jungle Elise was an extreme outlier with her super strong spider-of-all-trades early game. This is definitely a nerf, but we'll keep an eye on Elise as she adjusts.\" \nWe lowered Neurotoxin/Venomous Bite's damage versus monsters while making Cocoon's stun shorter at early levels and higher at later levels. We also shortened the cooldown of Rappel and lowered spiderling health at early levels but raised it at higher levels.\n\nNeurotoxin.pngQ - Neurotoxin\nBase Damage: 40/80/120/160/200 ⇒ 40/75/110/145/180\nMaximum % Health Damage vs Monsters: 60/120/180/240/300 ⇒50/75/100/125/150\nVenomousBite.png Q - Venomous Bite\nBase Damage: 60/110/160/210/260 ⇒ 60/100/140/180/220\nMaximum % Health Damage vs Monsters: 60/120/180/240/300 ⇒50/75/100/125/150\nCocoon.png E - Cocoon\nStun Duration: 1.5 seconds ⇒ 1/1.25/1.5/1.75/2 seconds\nRappel.png E - Rappel\nCooldown: 26/24/22/20/18 seconds ⇒ 26/23/20/17/14 seconds\nSpiderForm.png R - Spider Form\nSpiderling Health (Rough Values): 90~260 ⇒ 85~390\nSpiderling Health (Real Values): 90/100/110/120/130/140/150/160/170/180/190/200/210/220/230/240/250/260 ⇒85/95/105/115/125/135/145/160/175/190/210/230/250/275/300/325/355/390\n\nv4.9 (Actually good for Elise, but its a bugfix, not a buff.)\n\nRappel.png E - Rappel\nBugfix: Fixed a bug where the initial cast of Rappel could not be used on wards (Elise no longer needs to cast Rappel twice to descend on a ward)\n\nv4.13\nElise's cocoon got skinnier and her rappel range got shortened\n\n\"Thanks to her strong dueling power, great objective control (both in damage and spiderling tanking), and high utility ganks, Elise's got all the right things to make her a priority pick in competitive play. You'll hear the same for Lee Sin, but when a champion has so many strengths, it's tough to choose the right direction to take them. For now, our focus is less on introducing \"NEW\" meaningful weaknesses for Elise, and more about reducing her consistency and reliability in getting to targets.\"\n\nCocoon.png E - Cocoon\nWIDTH: 70 ⇒ 55\nSPIDER-VISION: Fixed a bug where Cocoon was providing vision longer than the stun duration (now correctly matches it)\nRappel.png E - Rappel\nSOME PREAMBLE: Rappel now calculates its range from the center of Elise to the center of the target ⇒ edge of Elise to the edge of the target (this means Rappel gains about +75 range)\nRANGE: 925 ⇒ 750 (~825 range if using the old targeting calculations)\n\n\nThat's 6 nerfs in a row on Elise (ignoring the bugfix that helped her). That's obscene to how much Riot has dedicated to making a champion weak. Some of nerfs are reasonable, like the neurotoxin and venomous bite changes to make her have more risk/reward mechanics, but this cluster of wanting to destroy a champion's ability to do much is just WTF.\n\nRiot has certainly emphasized Elise's weaknesses, but what the hell are her strengths? She can max cocoon to try to gank early and snowball team like she was originally meant to do, but wait, that makes her ability to fight anyone and clear jungle crap. She can max neurotoxin for better objective control, but that leaves her ganks weak and the new jungle makes her sustain weak. She can max Skittering Frenzy to let her farm jungle really well, but she isn't a late game scaler.","replies":[{"poster":"Tourian","date":"2015-01-12T00:51:49.593+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was aware of all this but seeing them all together makes me want to cry ;_;\nThis is how I translate the last nerf on her \"So we can get away with nerfing lee sin a bit, we're going to destroy Elise and Eve to cover it up.\" Seriously, the last nerf on her was absolutely unnecessary, same goes for eve, who I even admit to hating playing against, but its not fair for her to be useless.

I find the comparisons to Lee Sin somewhat pointless. Elise is a very different kind of champion in my opinion. \n\nBut i would agree, that she has been taken down a notch too far. Elise is a favorite of mine and I play her regularly since last Winter.\nElise can still be very strong, if she has a good start, in other words, early kills. But every fed champion is a threat, simply because he is fed. \n\nIf she has some kind of trouble in the beginning, then thats pretty much it. In my experience it's very hard to get her back on track. Her remaining Mid-Game Power is more or less wasted. And without a good Mid-Game her Late-Game also suffers. \nShe has a great risk to become a good-for-nothing in Late-Game, because everyone else can do everything she can, but better. Of course she still has her cc, which is never bad, but it can be dodged or missfired.\nShe is an off-tank, an off-mage and shes neither a supporter nor an adc.\nHer recommended building-path makes her a tank shredder, but if she has money trouble, she tends to be too squishy to dare get close and try to shred. (Or she builds something tanky and can get close, but will still do little shredding)\n\nYes she has a good gap-close/escape mechanism, but there are enough champions who have a follow up, especially since she is predictable. While most Junglers can jump wherever they want, she can only jump on enemy-targets and jungle-camps. Besides, if you miscaculate, Rappel easily becomes a very good suicide-mechanism. It also has a very long cool-down.\nThere is another problem to Rappel: You directly click your Rappel on someone/thing. Usually this means, she should jump on that object without delay. But if the target leaves her range, while she is \"going up\", she just stays there. Just hanging around...\nAt best it costs valuable time, at worst it kills her, because she can't jump anywhere else and everyone knows where she will go down. \nYou might wonder, why I concentrate my argumentation so much on her Rappel. I always thought that this is her defining skill. This is her niche as THE spider. There is no other skill quite like it.\n\nHer damage is mediocre because she appereantly poses a big risk to the enemy. And she does, but she also poses a big risk to herself, as most assasin-type champions do. But another assasin trademark is high damage. I have to admit this: Offically she is not categorised as Assasin-Type. \nElises main category is Mage. All other Mages are Mid-Laners with the exeption of Vlad. All of those Mid-Laners have a lot of damage and are somewhat squishy.\nElise doesn't fit in with them very well, no matter how I think about it. (Her secondary category is Fighter, which I find odd)\n\nRiot always emphasizes how important it is, that a champion has a clearly defined niche, a strong identity. Well I find Elise has become a bit fuzzy around the edges.
