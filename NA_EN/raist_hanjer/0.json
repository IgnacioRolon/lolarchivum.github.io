It&#039;s not my fault that they leave.\r\nIf it&#039;s my fault, tell me what can i do 4v5 game?\r\nMaybe an idea; you report a person for being afk and they being punished for it, game should give your lp back.\r\n\r\n&quot;Sorry for my bed england&quot; :P","replies":[{"poster":"I am Pacman","date":"2016-11-05T16:12:07.084+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"These threads pop up every couple months.

Who can guarantee that you'll lose and get same amount of lp. I mean 4 times your team has afk, 2 times your enemy. That's not fair at all. Think about vice versa; you gain 2 times free lp. It also not fair.","replies":[]}]}]}
