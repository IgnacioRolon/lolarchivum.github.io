Basically if my teammates unanimously decide to all report me, having reason or not, I&#039;m going to get banned. If I&#039;m with a premade 4 on my team and they decide they don&#039;t like me and want to all report me then I&#039;m getting banned. Regardless of how you act you can still get banned. What if I have 4 toxic members on my team that all want to report me then I&#039;m getting banned even though I&#039;m the non-toxic one. Bans are issued within seconds of the game ending so there is no possible way anyone is looking at it its just the system detecting reports and issuing the ban. I could mute every member of my team, play absolutely normal and they could decide to report me and ill get banned. Please prove me otherwise.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Tantram","date":"2016-03-04T21:05:08.140+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":0,"body":"Each and every report is validated for accuracy.

You wouldn't be punished at all if 10,000 people reported you for a single game and you did nothing wrong.\n\n> I'm getting banned even though I'm the non-toxic one\n\nThe vast majority of players never receive any type of punishment. You have gone through the entire punishment escalation schedule. I would strongly encourage you to look at what you are doing, instead of blaming others.","replies":[{"poster":"Darkslayer85","date":"2016-03-05T00:20:56.430+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":15,"body":"A while back there was a guy who got a 25 game chat restriciton without sayong anything in all three of his games.
