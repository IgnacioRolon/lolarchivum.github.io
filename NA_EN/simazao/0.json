It seems to happen randomly and two of my other friends have had the same issue where the \"Play\" button is unselectable and invitations to games says something along the lines of \"please wait\". I have waited and sometimes after 5 mins or so it goes away, while other times it hasn't gone away at all after waiting for more than 20 minutes. \n\nCouldn't find any helpful comments on this issue beyond the fact I can avoid it by using the old client. Any tips would be appreciated.\n\nEdit: Wanted to mention I don't seem to be having any connection problems, playing games quite well with low ms.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-20T03:56:32.175+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While you may not be having issues connecting to our *game servers*, you may be having issues maintaining a solid connection to our *matchmaking servers*.

My connection is 100% ive gone through the guide and have a great internet speed with no issues on anything else. the play button continously grays out, then lights up once every few minutes.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-21T21:42:21.614+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If the connection guide doesn't fix this for you, then is definitely is a bug with the Client. We've been seeing more reports of this bug, but the behavior is also commonly caused by a poor connection. This is why I first recommend ensuring your connection settings are good before determining if it's actually the bug or not. For the moment, I recommend using the *Legacy Client* (from login) until this has been resolved for good. Since I don't work on the team that works on these solutions, I can't provide an ETA on when that fix will be pushed out.\n\nIf you have any other questions, let me know.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Th√®RedBaron","date":"2017-02-20T04:27:17.119+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think this is the issue, Dozens of others are going through the same thing.
