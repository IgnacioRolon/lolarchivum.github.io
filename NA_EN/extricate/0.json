A &quot;Gank&quot; is a &quot;Gang Kill&quot;.  Gang, Crew, Group, Party..... MULTIPLE People.\r\n\r\nWhat a Gank is NOT.    A gank is NOT a solo effort... It is NOT individual...\r\n\r\nI AM SO TIRED OF PLAYING GAMES WHERE THE ENEMY JUNGLER IS AMAZING, GANKS ALL GAME LONG (2 v 1)... Then when I ask for our jungler to &quot;gank&quot;, they wait until I die or leave lane, then they run in solo immediately after (1 v 1, NOT GANK) and feed my lane.\r\n\r\nAsking for a gank is not me asking &quot;Hey, next time I die or recall, go 1 v 1 the mid laner&quot;. NO, THAT IS NOT WHAT ME ASKING FOR A GANK MEANS.\r\n\r\nJunglers, you need to understand what a gank is or isn&#039;t. I hope this has helped clear up some confusion as there are thousands of junglers out there who for sure 100% do NOT know what &quot;Gank&quot; means.\r\n\r\nThis is a public service announcement for the good of the community.\r\n\r\nTIRED OF YOUR SOLO FEED SHIT. STOP, GET OUT OF MY LANE, DO NOT GO IN 1 v 1 IF MID IS NOT THERE, THAT IS NOT A GANK. DO NOT TAKE MY CS, GANK OR GET THE HELL OUT OF MY LANE.","replies":[{"poster":"coeurloyal","date":"2016-05-05T22:28:13.561+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I question the amount of blame that you put on your jungler because so much of what you're saying is very reliant on the game situation. If you call for a gank while your jungler is in another lane or just came off a gank in a different lane, they can't just automatically be there to help you if you get in trouble. If you want a gank and aren't calling for it well in advance, you're likely not going to get what you want. \n\nAlso, you come off as very patronizing here. I don't know whether that's the case in-game or not, but if you treat your jungler like they're useless they're likely going to skip your lane in favor of those that are communicating well with them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Droogzy","date":"2016-05-05T19:44:23.488+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're going to play with good junglers and you're going to play with bad junglers, likewise, you're going to play against good junglers and you're going to play against bad junglers, take it in stride. I'm sure there are games where you completely stunk as a mid-laner and the opposing mid-laner was amazing, it applies to all lanes. \n\nAnd sorry, if I know I can 1v1 the opponent midlaner, I'm going to, regardless of if my mid-laner is around, if you died before hand, tough luck. If I kill him, that's an up-time of around 60 seconds you as a mid laner can CS in peace/deny CS to them, you're still benefiting from it even if you don't get an assist on the kill. \n\nAnd if the turret is killing minions, I'm going to kill them, its a waste of gold not to. \n\nAnd if you're spamming the assist ping, you bet your ass I'm going to ignore it. Plus, some mid-laners are simply a waste of time to gank, Zed, LB, Ahri, Ezreal, Lissandra (to a lesser extent), are all pointless in trying to gank.

Personally as a jungle main, I will not gank a lane if a lane is too far behind. My time and efforts are best spent trying to get other lanes, lanes that are either even or ahead, even further ahead. It takes too much to bring back a lane that is losing. Also, if a lane is spam pinging for a gank (I don't know if you are or not), I can guarantee that I will refuse to gank that lane. \n\nAlso, I personally HATE any laners that are raging at their own jungler after getting ganked when they are overextended without wards. Again, I do not know if this is you or not. With that being said, I will gank a lane if it is possible. If you're playing a no CC, no gap closer mid laner, and I'm a no CC jungler , it is extremely difficult to gank the likes of a LB, or Ahri, or Zed.\n\nEdit: If none of these apply to you, then yes, your jungler sucks and you need to find a new one.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CR4ZYRONDH4VI","date":"2016-05-05T19:36:39.672+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also they need to give blue buffs.
