Though it might encourage more good scouting behavior, it could also definitely lead to behavior that justified just randomly plopping a Hawkshot over every fight whether or not the vision is even useful. There could then be rules around when a Hawkshot should or shouldn't be worth an assist, but it would probably ultimately be unclear or very rules-heavy.\n\nDespite all that, I agree that it would be nice to get validated for those really good long range hawkshots. One of the reasons I changed the spell to be global a few years ago was to open up plays like this rather than just having Hawkshot simply be a short range gank path denial.","replies":[{"poster":"Cosnirak","date":"2017-10-09T02:19:16.876+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can/does Hawkshot affect vision score?
