We're working on a standardized 'this unit is invulnerable, so don't bother trying to hurt it right now' visual indicator for Taric, Kayle, Zhonya's etc. We've been playtesting it internally including in games like those used for the Ryze spotlight, it's not yet ready for release though (needs to account for special health bars like Jhin/Annie and needs to be coded at release quality rather than just a quicker prototype to prove the idea).","replies":[{"poster":"EROTIC RAID BOSS","date":"2016-07-12T22:34:23.330+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"just wondering, why the outline? rather than, say, turning the red health gold?
