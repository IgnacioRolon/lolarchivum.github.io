It seemed very likely that was the case and I was really hoping, if that is true, that you would share the concepts for each skin on the Boards or Twitter\r\n\r\nI was rooting for Ice Diana 10,000% but very unfortunately it didn&#039;t happen, i was extremely interested in what that would look like, as well as curious for all the others\r\n\r\nIf i&#039;m wrong and no concepts were made until now that the winner was decided, well there wasn&#039;t harm in asking","replies":[{"poster":"Kindlejack","date":"2015-12-24T22:11:22.826+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Aamano,\n\nit's a clever thought but realistically we can't afford to do six full concepts with the intention of only making one of them.

Or something deeper than that?\n\nI wasn't privy to the final decision but we went back and forth with the esports team on a number of points; diversity (top, mid, jungle - yordle, human, giant - cute, cool, spooky), scheduling of other skins we are working on, etc. Most important for us was the confidence in delivering a really awesome skin for either a Fire or Ice thematic - hence no Brand or Anivia. Another way we could have set it up if we really did want to include 'Fire Anivia' as a choice was to have two brackets to vote on, one for Fire and one for Ice which would result in a 'champion' for each team. I'll definitely recommend it for next year's event!","replies":[{"poster":"A Liberal","date":"2015-12-26T22:45:28.650+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is 2015 and we still don't have a fire anivia skin rito plz.\n\n*Holds out for battlecast anivia until death*","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Akenero","date":"2015-12-26T07:21:00.875+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Kindlejack,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=z7sB9dBT,comment-id=000000020000,timestamp=2015-12-25T10:52:35.570+0000)\n>\n> It was a combination of skins team and esports team deciding on champions that met a whole series of criteria.\n\nSo...can we get a fire/ice brand next?","replies":[{"poster":"A Liberal","date":"2015-12-26T22:45:00.090+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't we already have classic/cryocore brand?","replies":[{"poster":"Akenero","date":"2015-12-27T20:39:43.036+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Nevernewyear,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=z7sB9dBT,comment-id=00000002000000010000,timestamp=2015-12-26T22:45:00.090+0000)\n>\n> Don't we already have classic/cryocore brand?\n\nThat was the joke","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Aamano","date":"2015-12-25T03:35:39.050+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"aww\n\nwell\nI greatly appreciate a response","replies":[]},{"poster":"Marlos Boohzer","date":"2015-12-25T03:49:42.465+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":21,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Chespin2013","date":"2015-12-26T07:01:17.138+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"LOL you do know he/she's in the art department right?","replies":[]},{"poster":"LilQuacker","date":"2015-12-29T04:08:47.676+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I dont wanna see the removal of {{champion:57}}","replies":[]}]}]}]}
