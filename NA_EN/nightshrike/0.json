ESPECIALLY the Kassadin and Qiyana buffs. I'm guessing they don't play their own game, or they must be really bad at it if they do.\n\nAnd a teemo nerf in ARAM, lol....really Riot?","replies":[{"poster":"wolvius","date":"2020-02-06T00:57:03.505+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=The Man Rammer,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=QEiL1Zhv,comment-id=000100000000,timestamp=2020-02-05T13:46:49.559+0000)\n>\n\n> \n> And a teemo nerf in ARAM, lol....really Riot?\n\nI know right and more akali buffs, its nearly more mandatory to get oracle for akali than teemo as shes more deathly.\nOnly thing teemo has going for him is peoples stupidity, like lets walk through the turret alley the minions dont walk through......OMG theres a shroom there.\n######Seriously why people not buy oracle when they have a shaco, jhin &amp; a nidalee etc","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Ahri Baka","date":"2020-02-05T22:52:00.697+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"it is freaking random , but includes most of people's champions' pool , of course everyone own MF and Lux , and not everyone own Yorick and Volibear , you gotta get used to it.","replies":[{"poster":"NightShrike","date":"2020-02-06T10:19:24.214+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"See the problem there is, the likelihood of me not receiving MF for over an entire year, regardless of the ARAM only accounts, is so obscenely low, that it cannot possibly have happened for so long.

There is no way, given the way random selection works, that even when presented with the idea of ARAM accounts the odds are even between champions. for example like I mentioned before, I get Syndra all the time, and she is practically a god-tier ARAM champ.
