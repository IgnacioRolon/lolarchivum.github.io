I even voted on the remake I dont know if you can see the post game chat but our jungler was wondering how the vote passed 2-3, also since I did leave base and was top before minions spawns i'd reckon that counts as activity.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-04T16:24:49.295+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since you have specific questions about this match, I recommend reaching out to our specialists in a [support ticket.](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new)\n\nLet me know if you have any issues submitting that ticket.","replies":[{"poster":"kagepaladin","date":"2016-10-05T01:57:03.355+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well i already did before i made this post its been four days no response on either of my tickets.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-05T15:28:01.451+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Whoops, I had forgotten you had already submitted a ticket about the match, my b. \n\nAs for your tickets, there's definitely a bit of a delay in responses at the moment due to a ton of tickets we've had submitted to us recently.
