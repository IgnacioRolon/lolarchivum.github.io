Bro i just had a brand steal so much cs from me cus i went apc veigar instead of an adc. our ryze mid ended the game with 0 kills and like 13 deaths, our autofilled jg decided its best to keep ganking fed lanes instead of us bot lane where we actually still in the game. Used the excuse \"I main mid,\" when he never mentioned being autofilled in champ select. Our top kat? well she fed the teemo to death, dont let her kda trick you. she fed and then got some kills. my brand? 3-14.\r\n\r\nPlease, this keeps happening. WHAT the fuck do i do?? I have been in promos to silver like 4 times now, and only 1 of those times do i remember actually having teams that matched up well. Why am i getting trolls almost always. Why am i getting new iron players facing off against an almost fully loaded silver team? I get it, not that big of a difference in skill. Well wtf. I got infants on my team against toddlers. I fuckin bet the toddlers gonna whoop the infants ass.\r\n\r\nLike where do i go from here?","replies":[{"poster":"Chainman3","date":"2019-11-23T10:06:02.043+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/3210051052/2125522108558048?tab=overview\nhttps://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/3209974660/2125522108558048?tab=overview\n\nYou dont do things like this.","replies":[{"poster":"FioraWillCarry","date":"2019-11-23T14:16:48.545+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yep....I concur.

In fact I just finished a game where my zhao was inting and my nami was the most passive nami in the world. could not support if her life depended on it. (Tristana game)\n\n2. Also, prior to that finished a game with a troll jg as well, Shaco. Literally funniest shit i've seen all my life. my top lane was absolute shit.(Tristana game)\n\n3. Game before that had a sona who was useless, but in that game i did bad too (Varus game)\n\n4. Game before that had Literally a troll supp. Not bad, but a troll. Veigar was taking all my cs had like 1 in 10 minutes in the game. Before you say learn to last hit or some smart ass shit, I would like you to understand a lvl 1-3 twitch with no items deals less aa damage than a veigar's q or w.  (Twitch game)\n\n5. Game before that had a teemo supp, and it worked out fine. He didn't troll. I didn't do that bad, and we won game. (Sivir)\n\n6.

Why didnt you see me and sona were both useless? Or better yet me and sona had a bad game? Why did you label her as useless and yourself as having a bad game? \n\nI feel like you throw around the term \"troll\" and \"inting\" to anyone who is having a bad game.\n\nTake for example these 2 statements:\n\n>Game before that had Literally a troll supp. Not bad, but a troll\n\n>Also, prior to that finished a game with a troll jg as well, Shaco\n\nWhy is one \"literally a troll\" and the other is just a \"troll\".

Useless as in not there in general. Had i know that should wouldve happened, i wouldve picked sivir and just played safe and had her go some other lane.\n\n\nThe two statements, one is Literally a troll because he planned on trolling from the start, no supp item, stealing all cs, and not cooperating about giving me my cs.\n\nsecond statement means the jg was also trolling to some point, but i dont the same amount of evidence. I like how you keep coming after me, but why dont u just watch the games instead of coming at me using the vocab i use. shaco went and fed top lane(illaoi). didnt show up once bot(only ones ahead)\nliterally winning lane, but mumu ganks us 3 times in a row with no reward, but we couldnt push because of this. kept jinx in game through cs. this also basically gave them like the first two drakes. while this all happened shaco was top failing ganks, and continuously going back to the fed illaoi. Now i know what you're going to say. He is bad not a troll. well he started to troll later on in the game. would split push instead of joining team fights and would not appear for 1 drake or baron to contest. the one time he went to infernal. half of us were dead the other half were top lane. he died and they took it.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"IcyShadow11","date":"2019-12-09T00:08:43.339+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"here's another troll lol. \n\nhttps://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=Mast3r+Giggles \nbut amazingly he is also terrible at the game.

You already play veigar. \n\nStaying in bot lane and not climbing is just a self-fulfilling prophecy.   All of your supports are going to be complete garbage if not downright trolls at that Elo.  And even if you get some kills early, you are still going to be behind in xp to solo lanes.   \n\nTop is also dead simple, and you can even play stuff like adc Trist, Quinn, Vayne top, tank Veigar top, Garen (apply face to keyboard), Mordekaiser, and Nasus.   All you have to do top is basically go even (don't die and farm), then show up to team fights and clean up with your level and gold advantage. It really doesn't matter what you play top/mid, just so long as you get the xp, cs,  and don't hard feed it is literally freelo.  But you do you...\n\nJust look at your last four losses and who carried the game for the enemy team:\n\nTop\nMid\nTop\nTop\n\n\nIt isn't so much about being a win condition yourself as taking away 50% of the enemy team's free win condition should they get fed.
