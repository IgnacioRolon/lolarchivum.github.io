Along with my TV and phones and thus I try not to run it all when playing the game, but it doesn't stop it from having packet loss/buffering issues. Also I see you're in NA and most net providers here suck no matter how much you spend.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-11T16:48:08.604+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It looks like your network is having an issue and causing you to have packet loss, or input delays.

There should be a long list of how to fix certain issues you have with league and your comp. Basically I ran the test found out there was an issue with my ISP, called them the next day, found that there was an issue and got it resolved, played tonight with none of this.","replies":[]}]}
