My friends have access to it. When i try to connect with another account, it is not working. I gave my account informations to a friend who had the chat service working, and connecting to my account gave him the same problem that i have. After that he went back on his own account, and he is still unable to connect to chat. Are you aware of this at Riot ? Is there something I can do about it? Don't hesitate if you need more information.\r\n\r\nSphax","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-16T21:19:58.777+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did you recently apply any updates to your OS?  Regardless, this issue is usually caused by a network issue failing to connect to the chat server.  I suggest using our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to help get it fixed up!

I tried reboot my box and my computer it didn't work. Then I played some ARAM (with friends who invited me by entering my nickname in the invite window) and I could reconnect between two games by clicking on the reconnect button. I don't know what it was but it seems to work well now. I'll say if it happens again. See ya !","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Rh√≠n","date":"2016-08-16T21:59:04.395+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also having this issue on EUW","replies":[]}]}
