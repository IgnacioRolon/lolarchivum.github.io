I love this champion but I never know how to build him. I like to go 1 or 2 damage items into tank (sunfire cape, deadmans plate both feel great on him) but for the damage items I&#039;m never sure. Bork always seems good but a lot of people say that&#039;s bad. Black cleaver is pretty logical but it doesn&#039;t feel like it does much and I really like attack speed on him cause you can just tear through anyone with w. The way I play him is largely focused around mini form, with mega just being a cc machine in teamfights with minor aoe burst to help out. Anyway, so I guess I just want to know what I should build on him.","replies":[{"poster":"Serevas","date":"2015-11-08T15:38:59.354+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{item:3071}} {{item:3143}} {{item:3022}} {{item:3156}} {{item:3102}} {{item:3111}} or {{item:3047}} That's the most common items I see picked up for Gnar, I've also seen {{item:3053}} {{item:3742}} included in there as well. You can also opt for {{item:3068}} if you really need the armor, but as a whole it's not that great of an item any longer.","replies":[{"poster":"IronwallJackson","date":"2015-11-08T16:21:49.480+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sunfire is picked up because it lets Gnar transform faster and he wants to be in the absolute middle of a teamfight once he does transform. Also, the passive is at its most effective in that exact spot as well, since it's affecting more enemies.\n\nIt has little to do with how good of an item it is and everything to do with the utility that Gnar gets out of it.\n\nAlso, BorK and Trinity are useful pickups since they're good on mini and mega Gnar respectively.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Slinkyb","date":"2015-11-08T15:48:20.302+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well Gnar is a top lane champion.  Inherently tanky with scaling damage.  It's why you build him that way. If you want to make him more attack speed oriented these would be my suggestions.  Makes him very team oriented later and able to do a lot in teamfights.  If you want to make him more of a ranged attacker get {{item:3078}} and another attack speed item, but don't get rid of {{item:3071}}.  The health+CD+AD+Passive is just too good to pass up on most Top laners.  You might be able to get away with buying TBC and a Trinity Force and one more attack speed item if you get two defensive items after that are armor or magic resist only.  Going half and half would be bad.  Sunfire cape wouldn't be a good idea if you are making a ranged build.  A Dead man's Plate actually fits this build some too.  Also, you could just build him like a ADC.  You would have to give up one or two items for a TBC and Trinity force though.  \n\nItem sets-\n\n1. ADC-Trinity Force, TBC, Infinity Edge, Berserker's Greaves, The Bloodthirster, Statikk Shiv\n2. Top with attack speed- TBC, Trinity Force, Blade of the ruined king, Dead man's Plate, pick two other defense items or pick up one more attack speed item and one more defense item-You can trade the BOTRK out with a Bloodthirster or Statikk Shiv or IE or a Phantom Dancer.  Up to you really.\n3. Same as #2, but you will want 2 defense items instead of 3. So pick up another attack speed item.\n\nI would experiment with #2.  See if having two more defense items hinders your basic attacks too much and try with one more defense item and one more attack speed item and see how that goes.  Just have to test and see for yourself.\n\nHe only has one magic damage attack so I wouldn't be worried about AP, but Trinity force does have a little on it.  \n\nHope this at least helps you to get the thought process going.  Doesn't mean I am right or anything.  This was based on the fact you said you wanted to try attack speed on him.  Otherwise go the other builds that were listed.","replies":[]},{"poster":"fééd l0rd","date":"2015-11-08T15:39:25.593+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Depends how your lane goes. \nI usually pick up those items\n{{item:3022}} / {{item:3153}} \n{{item:3047}} / {{item:3111}} \n{{item:3071}} \n{{item:3742}} / {{item:3143}} \n{{item:3065}} \n{{item:3026}}","replies":[]}]}
