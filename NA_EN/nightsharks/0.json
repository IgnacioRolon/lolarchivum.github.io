Distinctly Asian, yet with definite Western influences. It&#039;s an interesting mix of styles, between the orchestral moments and the Asian percussion/wind moments. \r\n\r\nMy thoughts?\r\nIf I close my eyes, I&#039;m taken to a seemingly peaceful yet ancient landscape, filled with centuries of mysteries and adventures. The thing that stuck out to me the most was the mix of Asian and Western styles, it created a really interesting listening experience. The second half of the piece delved into those mysteries, with layers of magic and mystique waiting to be discovered. The percussion instrumentation peaked my interest as well, with a lot of non-standard instruments being used (even being a percussionist myself, I couldn&#039;t identify all of them!) and there were quite a lot of neat effects between the different cymbals and drums in the back.\r\n\r\nIt&#039;d be neat if you could expand a bit and experiment with different instrumentations and styles more often. I love what was done with the Kindred theme, because it was distinctly unique being a duet instead of breaking out into a full orchestra partway through like Tidecaller. It would be cool to see more of this style, less epic orchestra and more smaller ensembles. This is definitely a step outside of the box, and we&#039;ve been seeing more of these recently (Jhin, anyone?). Riot&#039;s diversity goal doesn&#039;t apply only to gameplay and champions, and this piece definitely shows it.\r\n\r\nNot to say that I don&#039;t enjoy what is already on the table, I bought the Vol 1 album on release day and I really look forward to new musical releases, but a few threads back someone (Ed, I thnk?) asked for criticism as well as the glowing compliments everyone already gives. \r\n\r\nThank you, Riot!","replies":[{"poster":"Ed the Conqueror","date":"2016-01-20T01:03:27.448+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for your comments!
