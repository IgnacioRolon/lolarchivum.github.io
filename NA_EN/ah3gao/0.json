Only the game is frozen.\r\nAny idea how to fix this? So far I tried using vpn, hextech repair tool, restarting my router, re-installing the game, suspending background apps. None seemed to work.\r\nI have a gigabit internet from Comcast (ethernet) and a nice build (Gtx 1070, i5-8400, 16g ddr4 ram, 250g ssd etc).\r\nJust to clarify this is not a fps/ping issue. It&#039;s just random disconnects though internet is working...\r\n\r\nThanks.","replies":[]}
