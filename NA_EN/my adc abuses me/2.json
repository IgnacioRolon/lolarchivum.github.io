That said, I think we'd all appreciate a knowledgeable Rioter (perhaps they know as little as we do and therefore refrain from commenting) telling us more.

The big danger is that other systems, be it goverments, religiions or corporates, adapt that system and further develope it, getting a smarter and way more suptile aproach than china.\n\nEdit:\nAfter further research, it appears that Sesame Credit is not more than a chinse version of FICO-Rating or Shufa. So a raw credit-rating with no political intentions.\n( a good article on this subject: http://qz.com/519737/all-chinese-citizens-now-have-a-score-based-on-how-well-we-live-and-mine-sucks/)\n\nHowever, the chinise goverment is indeed planeing a social credit score for 2020, haveing a competion of serveral credit scores as pilot projects for the governmental credit score, with the most prominent one beeing sesame credit.\nSo while sesam credit atleast for now is a raw credit rateing system, it probably will serv as fundation for a govermental system.\nThere is actually not much known about that govermental system besides the directive.\n\nThe problem is that the directive is very vague, while it does not directly state that data is used as implyed by extracredits, it also does not say thatz it will not.\n\nfrom the directive:\n\n  \n>   ....establishing the idea of an sincerity culture, and carrying forward sincerity and traditional virtues, it uses encouragement to keep trust and constraints against breaking trust as incentive mechanisms, and its objective is raising the honest mentality and credit levels of the entire society.\n>     (....)\n>     Government promotion, joint construction with society. Fully give rein to the organizational, guiding, promoting and demonstration roles of government. The government is responsible for formulating and implementing development plans, completing regulations and standards, fostering and supervising credit service markets\n>     (....)\n>     foster good habits of sincerity and trust-keeping,\n>     (...)\n>     ...and guide toe construction of professional ethics and behavioural norms.\n\nI think the main problem is that in this context, the definition of terms like 'honest mentallity', 'professional ethics' and 'behavioural norms' is not given. Combined with the frequent mention of 'Government promotion', this certainly hints to the possibility that the definitions of 'good habits of sincerity and trust-keeping' and such will be up to the goverment, and while the directive does not push one to interpretations such as the one in extra credits, it certainly does allow for such interpretations, and the though of it isn't far fetched.\n\ni'm still very skeptic towards what happens in china,as they are creating a social credit rateing(and actually serveral credit rateings for everything, includeing rateing systems) with reward/punishment systems, and they use lots of data for that, which gets suppostly provided by alibaba(though this isn't confimed by alibaba) weehboo and so on(though that doesn't really differ much from the western world, only that china is more open about data collection) but it's not as bad as extracredits makes it look like, especially in how far tencent is involved on it.\n\nHowever, the idea of an establishment useing gameification in a similar way as presented by extracredits remains most unsettling.\n\n_Disclaimer: I only did skim the directive and i am by far expert for such things, so take this with a grain of salt and look into the directive your self._\n","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Remlap1223","date":"2015-12-17T02:18:52.020+0000","up_votes":38,"down_votes":1,"body":"HOLY.

So is the Sesame Score.\n\nThe Sybil System is the extreme personification of the Sesame Score.  It models you around what society expects of you, and you get branded a \"latent criminal\" or in this case \"unpatriotic\".  You get your rights taken away from you, and if it's high enough, thrown in prison or executed on the spot.\n\nThe Sybil System was so unbelievably bad that a woman got beaten to death in the street by some dude wearing a helmet that mimicked the Psycho-Pass of the last person he saw, and people literally just stood around and watched.  They had no clue on how to respond to danger, because Sybil had ingrained in the minds of the public that the system was perfect at catching criminals and preserving order, even though a woman literally got beaten to death right in front of them.  To add insult to injury, just before she died, she got a warning from the government, because her Psycho-Pass got cloudy (you know, because I\"m sure you wouldn't be completely stress free if you were being beaten to death).  I'm not even talking about the \"criminally asymptomatic\" assholes that literally could slit someone's throat out in public without registering a single point on their Psycho-Passes.\n\nThis kind of shit really isn't that far off.  Sesame Scores are going to be mandatory in 2020, and while a system that can adequately measure someone's mental health status from just scanning them is something not happening anytime soon, using China's version of Facebook to weed out potential political dissidents before they can spread their message is particularly powerful.  Not to mention, they don't even need to punish them and censor them, because using positive and negative reinforcement, they can use social ostracization to do all the work for you.  Like they said in the video; fear is negative and breeds resentment.  Assassinations and government purges and other means of suppressing the populace build resentment.  But social ostracization is extremely benign and most people would never see it as an attack on their freedoms, just keeping out the undesirables that would harm their perfect society.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Daedalus871","date":"2015-12-17T03:27:57.751+0000","up_votes":28,"down_votes":6,"body":"All hail our Chinese overlords!\n\n(Can I get some free RP now?)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Teslablade","date":"2015-12-17T01:40:28.201+0000","up_votes":20,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/yJYm5T0F-riot-this-needs-to-be-explained-or-addressed-immediately\n\nI had an in-depth post about this earlier.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Unanamu","date":"2015-12-16T22:23:59.342+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":37,"body":"that sesme score is based on the taobao account you created with nothing but an email address and most likely calculated based on the points you accumulated from purchasing, weibo, bank account, qq service are all seperare accounts under control of different companies, not to mention most china internet and telephone service is based on anonymous prepaid method\n\n\nunless china simultanousely dismantles tencent, alibaba, sina and China telecom, china unicom, merge their client data bank into one and force real name registration plus only one per person, developing this new technology of keeping bank accounts private while its purchasing history not, forbid any new start up internet site built with non real name register tracking any offline real money purchase then i dont see how this is a problem","replies":[{"poster":"PhDs Nuts","date":"2015-12-17T01:26:20.776+0000","up_votes":29,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Unanamu,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=FMINwB37,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-12-16T22:23:59.342+0000)\n>\n>snip\n\nThe No-fly List is getting a lot of attention in the US recently.

It may happen at some point that this kind of a system gets implemented in our countries and we should know what the problems are to ensure that doesn't happen. \n\nAs an example, in India Facebook tied up with TRAI(Telecom Regulatory Authority of India) which is basically a government branch that deals with telecommunication and internet, to implement some kind of permit for private telephone companies to ensure some websites get high speeds while others don't, Facebook being one of them. So basically, these telephone companies would charge you additional money for services that allowed internet calling like Skype and Whatsapp or chatting like Hangouts or Telegram for normal or high speeds. If you didn't pay that money, the speeds of these services and websites would be so slow, that you won't be able to use them anyway. (.l.. you Mark Zuckerberg). In gaming terms, if my telephone company gets paid by Blizzard, then I would only have good ping playing WoW. If I decided to play league, I wont be able to, because my speed and ping would be off the charts. At the same time, my neighbor with a telecom company paid by Riot, would have perfect speed for league, but will have problems with WoW or other games.\n\nSo this buncha guys who had a youtube channel called [AIB](https://www.youtube.com/user/allindiabakchod) managed to catch it made a similar video to raise awareness for it and promote the people to take a stand against this stupid ruling called [Save the Internet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfY1NKrzqi0) which was viewed by a HUGE number of people. The people took a stand threatening the government and, being the largest democracy, the government bowed to the pressure and stopped it going any further. \n\nTL; DR: These guys are trying to make you aware how you can be controlled sneakily without having any idea till its too late.

Since the source it based on is a fabricated story. \"open sesame\" will open the door of hidden treasures for \"Ali baba\" (the company name behind it) based on Arabia fairy tales. Isn't it obvious this is at best a marketing stunt?\n\"Sesame Credit System\" is a 3rd party online reputation (called Credit but not really) evaluation and tracking system run within the boundary of services provided by \"Alibaba\", the giant internet company in China equivalent of Amazon+Ebay+Facebook. While this system is based on big data, it takes in user's internet posts, the product you bought, etc into account, then produces a credit score, which is used if you want to apply loan from the same company, all this happens within the boundaries of services provided by one company, Alibaba. So it is not too different from Amazon reputation, or Reddit karma. The difference is the sesame score is cleverly named \"Credit Score\" and it has a range between 0 and 900, to confuse people, especially those who lives in the US\n\"Credit China\" is a government run business complaint/case history tracking system, similar to BBB. It claims it also tracks 900k individuals, or 0.08% of the total population, however these individuals are most likely business representatives. This system does NOT generate a credit score as result. Unlike what the article claimed.\nThe two systems are not linked in any way. So, the foundation of the article is based on a frictional, \"would-be\" story. The article assumes Ali's credit system is the ultimate version of government credit system. It's easy to see that is unlikely and not feasible because government does not have access to the intimate details of buyer-seller relation, among other information. They may attempt to do it in a secret way, somehow. However, will they use secret info in a public credit score? My guess is unlikely.\nYou must realize no matter how big Alibaba is, they still have competitors (in fact, many huge companies as competitors), and China also have anti-monopoly laws. Alibaba's system is not implementable at the State level, because it requires a virtual monopoly of e-commerce, online communication, phone, etc by ONE company. Be it private or state-owned, that is the end of Chinese economy.\nSo even if the government will build a social credit system, it will be likely NOT based on online communications, your message on discussion forums, or buying/selling records. Those are still within each private company's database (like Alibaba). More likely, (and this is just my speculation) the government system is based on record of debt collection, loan, tax etc just like the US credit system today. The difference might be that it will be a government department, not three independent organizations, that keep credit scores. Then, there is the question of if your credit score needs to be accessible by other people. In most countries, you can pay a fee to get to know other people's credit score, for example, as part of background check. How easy/difficult Chinese government will make this process be, I can not predict.","replies":[{"poster":"The Governer","date":"2015-12-17T21:48:59.240+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Seeing this thread makes me realize how oblivious a lot of people are.\n\nThey never question sources or veracity of the video and form judgments merely based on the video instead of asking \"is it true?\".\n\nEven the Youtube comment section has more people questioning sources than this thread.

It means that citizens of India can make as many parties as they like and propose candidates from them for the elections. However China, has a single party system.

If this were applied to the US system, you would only be able to elect a Republican because the Democrat party wont exist.

So unless the candidate is standing as an individual, the presidential candidates will belong to either of these two parties. India on the other hand, has a multiple party system. It means that citizens of India can make as many parties as they like and propose candidates from them for the elections. However China, has a single party system. So the candidates who will stand for presidential elections will be from one party only. If this were applied to the US system, you would only be able to elect a Republican because the Democrat party wont exist. So even though it looks like democracy, its not a true democracy, because even though on face value people get to choose between candidates, the candidates can't exert their free will and in the end the same party will continue to rule China till the end of time and hence the communism stays.\n> \n> TL; DR: Its amazingly different from the US because you actually get a choice to vote for someone who doesn't have to follow a specific party ideal. So if such a system were going to be applied by a party to the country, it would fall hard in the next elections and probably wouldn't get elected till the people forgot about the incident. In China, the party has nothing to fear. Even if the people don't like their ideals they have no choice but to elect someone of the same party because, no other parties are allowed. Admittedly in the US, you don't exactly get a HUGE range of choice, but still its better than being a farce democracy where you have no rights to say and type whatever the hell you want about the government or the president and get away scott free.\n\nLook beyond the surface. And plus, don't fool yourself into thinking the US has any democracy. That's long gone after Citizen's United. And while you're busy going crazy over some celebrity scandal, some politician scandal, or Donald Trump, your friendly Congress will be signing into law bills that benefit few and harm many. And simultaneously while you're listening to CNN and Fox spew \"the truth\" the President will be able to have any American assassinated, and is allowed to send troops to fight without actually declaring war.\n\nAnd if you really think invading other countries and killing *the people* who aren't interested in what we call democracy is democratic, then you're blind. America used to be great. America used to be all about its own people. The America of today is not a democracy, but an empire.","replies":[{"poster":"Sid88","date":"2015-12-17T11:25:30.960+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"Well I although I've heard this from Americans, that a lot of them think their democracy doesn't exist.

So if George Bush Jr. decided to invade other countries, you gotta understand that the guy got elected. I mean there was another candidate who probably didn't wanna do it. You had a choice. The people of China don't get that choice. Which is why its much worse out there. \n\nSee you're talking about how your democracy is flawed and their signing bills that harm the people. That its not a democracy anymore but an empire. In China you might get arrested for that, and thrown in jail for being a traitor or worse. It wouldn't matter to them whether you're right or wrong. In the US you have the freedom to stand in the election. You can be a President if you worked for it. If a majority of the people support you, you'll get elected. I mean. YOU can do that as a citizen of the US. No one can actually stop you from doing it! If you don't wanna join a party and get party funding, you can step up as an individual candidate. \n\nFor example, in our country, the current Prime Minister (equivalent to an American President) started his life as someone who worked on the streets selling tea. Just because his thoughts matched those of the people of this country he got elected and now is doing whatever the hell he wants with 0 opposition, because this man won with a mandate that absolutely no one ever has in the history of the world. We had a choice, and we made ours. You have a similar choice now. People of China -> No Choice.\n\nBut one thing everyone must understand is that in any and all places, the people are responsible for how their country behaves.

After visiting a lot of other countries over the past few years I have never met a warm and friendly bunch as the Americans! (don't even get me started on Europe! ugh EU is BAD!) So you can imagine how hard it is for me to actually believe that America isn't great anymore. Sure you're not the financial leader of the world!

America *was* after all, the one to rebuild Europe after the World Wars. You're correct when you say that there are some really friendly people here, but I have to say that there is a lot of propaganda here as well as the entertainment industry which controls the populace. The population thinks they're happy and great (usually), while we're in the process of having things happen that shake the bounds of democracy. The USA is no democracy, it is an oligarchy and an aristocracy. I'm willing to bet that India also has elements of the same. This model of democracy that was force fed to the world is flawed because it can easily be manipulated by a few for their own personal gain. \n\nAm I saying China isn't horrible? No, they are. I'm just saying many of the exemplary \"democracies\" of the world are not really kuch better.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"AMYS GRAVE","date":"2015-12-18T19:00:10.027+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would really love to see an official riot stance about this.
