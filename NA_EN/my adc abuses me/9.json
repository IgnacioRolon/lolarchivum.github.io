I'm a persuasive speaker. So I came at her with all the overwhelming evidence. Piles on piles.\r\n\r\nBut it was useless. She is home schooled and has zero interest in going to college, and has very little education to go by. She has difficulty even reading apparently. I ended up finding out she thinks the moon gives off its own light and that we never went to space and all this.\r\n\r\nI spent over a month trying to convince her from every viewpoint imaginable but all I ever got in response was, \"Those are just words that don't mean anything\" or \"I've heard all that before and it's lies\" until I couldn't take it anymore and ended it on a really sour note.\r\n\r\nSo be glad that even if you don't attract many people, at least you don't exclusively attract nut jobs like I do.","replies":[]}
