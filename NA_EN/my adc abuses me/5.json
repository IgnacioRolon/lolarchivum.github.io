When we investigated pre- and post-game chat, the question we asked was: \"What is the incremental value we would get by adding this feature? Would we identify more toxic players, and if so, how many more?\" It turns out that many players who are toxic in pre- and post-game chat are also toxic in-game, and tend to be caught by the Tribunal. However, **Riot does have access to the logs--they just aren't hooked up to the Tribunal system.** Given the choice, should the player behavior team work on Champ Select issues, or work on pre- and post-game chat? The answer is pretty clear.\n>\nIn saying this, as you might have heard from other player behavior members, we have been shifting away from feature development on punishment systems. Like I mentioned in the GDC talk linked earlier in this thread, we're focusing much of our development on making the game more enjoyable for neutral and sportsmanlike players instead of focusing on the toxic players.\n\nPlease upvote for the time I spent looking for this, instead of downvoting for being skeptical.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Knight SoIaire ","date":"2015-07-12T13:13:02.001+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"smart toxic players ? \n\nthose use all the tools they have to get their fun \n\n\nrule first of smart trolling ... use your champion for the bad stuff ... preferably bard's ultimate or tahm kench's w \n\nrule 2 every time you succed in trolling and causing damage to your team use chat \"sorry mate ... that was a mistake\"\n\nrule 3  do it in such a way that your teammates will have to become aware of your trolling and their lack of power to stop you becuase officialy you are just a player who has a bad game ... realy nice and healthy player ... a teamworking friendly player\n\nand whatever they throw at you ... you are just a bad player who made some bad decisions ... they cant punish you for not playing too good ","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"FatesDefiler","date":"2015-07-12T03:04:29.502+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":4,"body":"was playing aram against a ryze, fiddles, karthus, thresh, and teemo.  i was laughing pretty hard at how badly we were being abused.  i typed into team chat, mostly to console my teammates during the process of this horrific whooping we were recieving:\n\n'wow, they pretty much have the perfect aram team'.\n\nmy ally urgot replies:\n\n'quit complaining, their team isn't that great'\n\nI replied:\n\n'not complaining, they have a few of the highest dps champs in the game, plus teemo'.\n\nafter the game when we get to the lobby he says:\n\n'qq more bbygirl'\n\nand I see the notification that i've just been reported pop up on my screen.  what choice do I have at that point but to report him back?  i'm honestly afraid to play this game pvp anymore.  i get this kind of people about every other game and they usually choose me as their target and I've got the ban counts to prove it.

What would help our peace of mind even more is if we got a pop up that says \"you got someone banned!  \"  or \"you got someone chat restricted\". This would not only give people peace of mind that the serious cases of harassment are punished, it would dissuade people from reporting for stupid things.\n\n If someone reported their team mates for things like   \"this noob he doesn't even know how to play tahm kench what a noob god damn\"  they would get no recognition from rito. This way some people will stop being so toxic, or at least not send as many dumb reports.","replies":[{"poster":"Daxterr","date":"2015-07-12T14:46:07.733+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"In fact I bet that's what happened to the lore.

The automatic system cannot distinguish between false and true reports. That's why after getting a false report, there is still a popup saying \"you got reported\" and warning you to not be toxic. The automatic system will still chat restrict you for being \"Toxic\" even with these false reports.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ratchet Fortune","date":"2015-07-12T11:30:05.776+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"came here to say I love your name \n\nlol","replies":[]}]}
