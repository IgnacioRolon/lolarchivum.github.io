I would like to extend my experience with Riot games, so I was wondering if I could possibly get a job to work for you guys. To me this would be so cool if joined the team, and I'm thrilled to see what you have to say, or if theirs any opportunities for me. Looking forward to your reply :)","replies":[{"poster":"Bouncing  Weapon","date":"2015-06-01T03:09:14.722+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://www.riotgames.com/careers I believe you are looking for this page","replies":[]},{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-06-01T03:19:57.777+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"As Bouncing Weapon mentioned - [The Careers Page](http://www.riotgames.com/careers) is a great place to start! It lists current available positions, as well as the kinds of tasks you'd be doing in each discipline. I'd also suggest checking out [this LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/grp/home?gid=3544410)! Many Rioters hang out here, as well as others looking for more info on Riot in regards to the job aspect. :]","replies":[{"poster":"Blazeyice","date":"2015-06-01T03:28:40.328+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I looked at that already and I looked at the different kinds of jobs, but I'm not sure if I needed a degree or some sort of skill to hold that position and I'm not certain about the jobs because they don't have the description of the selected jobs","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-06-01T17:07:10.853+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm currently in QA, which is a good place to start in a lot of cases. What do you have interest in? What part of League of Legends do you particularly enjoy and would like to help make even better? What kinds of things are you interested in now - art, talking to people, finance? Think about the kinds of things you like in general, and then we can think about how to apply them to a specific discipline. \n\nAs Valkyrie Witch mentioned, many jobs don't require one specific degree. For example, I'm a Content QA Analyst on the Skin Team, and I majored in Graphic Design. \n\nOnce you find out what you'd like to do (animation, visual effects, community, etc), you'll need to learn the skills associated with said job; the programs used, techniques, processes, etc. Experience is also a plus in many cases. Since you're 16, there's still a lot of room for grabbing an internship that could help you gain experience and a solid skill set. :]","replies":[{"poster":"Blazeyice","date":"2015-06-05T01:02:53.140+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For me I have a huge interest in art,  it would be awesome to like make skins for champions and give ideas, and maybe create champions long with making the community a better place and make the League of Legends experience better with intense and fun game modes. I also like visual effects for everything from pictures to editing videos and I see that also in the game, which is another of my interests. Ill go to the career page to explore the careers and information about it, sorry for late reply I've been having finals at school and I needed to study.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-06-09T17:17:31.146+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"No worries at all, I've actually been busy the last few days, too. :] \n\nSeems like you've got a lot of different routes you could take. \n\nIf you like coming up with new skins, might I suggest working towards a concept artist - drawing ideas for new skins. If drawing isn't your strong suit, you could always work as a particle artist on skins or champion teams. \n\nIf you're more into creating champions, you can practice making kits for a champion (and you could always tie in concept art to come up with a visual of what your champion could look like,)\n\nWe also have a team who works on creating new game modes! You could create a doc that explains how the game mode would work, if stats would be changed, and you could note if various champions could potentially be OP on the mode.\n\nIf you have any questions about this kind of stuff, please feel free to reach out!","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2015-06-01T03:59:17.936+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The best part about (free) applications is that it doesn't hurt to try.\n\nWhich jobs are you interested in? See who currently holds positions in that job and check out their LinkedIn pages, do specific google searches on the job, and maybe contact them on their public social media pages and ask what they had or would suggest.\n\nLast job thread I read, the Rioter said there was no prerequisite degree for their particular position, but suggested experience/degrees that would go a long way for it.","replies":[{"poster":"Blazeyice","date":"2015-06-01T04:10:16.261+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah that's true, I'm really cant decided what job i'm interested for cause there all awesome and I wouldn't mind doing any other one.
