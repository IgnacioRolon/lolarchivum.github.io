I appreciate that it is free, and I love the game but, it isn't as fun when it doesn't work correctly.\n\nIf you restore default it takes off fps cap (which I want because I don't like frying my computer to play league at max settings) and it shuts off anti-aliasing (which I want because it makes your frame rate changes smooth and unnoticeable instead of fluctuating and unplayable even at 120 fps when it drops to 60 fps it fucks you out of so many frames at once you miss the whole first half of a team fight) but, it will give you better fps when no one is casting spells.
