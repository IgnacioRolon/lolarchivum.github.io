Didn't know where to place this correctly.)\n\nSo, I went through my boyfriends closet because we are moving. So we needed to sort out what we're keeping vs. what we're just tossing away. I bumped into an old PC of his, still has windows XP on it, and is old as dirt. I decided to blow the dust off the old hag, and show it to him. He was very surprised because he forgot the PC was in his closet at all anymore, and that it was in one piece. He told me,\"Hey, if you get that PC to work, maybe we can finally play League of Legends with each other again.\" (He BADLY wants to play League with me again. We met each other two years ago online... - ON LEAGUE. We started online dating, and ended up moving in together. Been with each other ever since. But also haven't made or saved enough money to buy a PC for myself so we can play again (sadface)  - So we haven't played League together in two years. And it pains us very much as we can't find any GOOD games to play with each other.)  Anyway, I got the PC to work and saw it already had League of Legends on it. I was surprised and said,\"Well, then!\" pretty loud which made him look at the screen, and said,\"OMG!!!\" I had the client up from the version of League that was already on there. We were both dying of laughter because...(Screenshot provided, so refer to that sexy thang.) \n\nI ended up saying,\"OHHHOOOO MY GOD ITS LIKE A DISCOVERY!\" -More laughter- \"IT'S LIKE A FOSSIL!\"\n\nSadly enough, League is too OP now to play on said Windows XP Grandma computer. The discovery was quite a sight to behold, though.","replies":[{"poster":"Carnival Knights","date":"2014-10-13T17:04:49.630+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":0,"body":"IT BELONGS IN A MUSEUM","replies":[{"poster":"Trick1F","date":"2014-10-13T18:00:48.061+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"> IT BELONGS IN A MUSEUM\n\nClever girl.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Smoofy","date":"2014-10-14T18:16:50.134+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, it does.

(I know..lol) I screenshotted a lot of my milestones in the game. I quit playing for years after I accomplished too much to be bored in the game and over time just grew out of it. After maybe 4 years, I found old screenshots of the game, etc. And man...Have the graphics and gameplay changed. Couldn't get back into the game though. It was too new and I had no idea what was going on anymore. So it's just a game I have an inactive account on now. Plus, League is my addiction now.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"OuttaControl56","date":"2014-10-12T16:53:33.293+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Beautiful.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rydil","date":"2014-10-12T15:53:57.558+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"GG, screenshot broke :|","replies":[{"poster":"Smoofy","date":"2014-10-14T18:37:00.586+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It seems to be working fine for me still.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Zeliwin","date":"2014-10-13T23:25:04.387+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"You know,\n   My video card in my computer died (ATI Radeon 6950) and I was surprised to see that my integrated video card on my 60$ Motherboard plays this game at 40fps (low settings) So your excuse of not being able to save enough money for a computer seems like it ploy trying to get sympathy donations! \n\nGo get AMD 980 Black Edition processor, with 4 gigs ram, and a cheap mobo for 60/80$ and a cheap case.

His friend gave him that PC about 4-5 years ago. (I THINK) He couldn't really give me a time frame, but he said it was when he hung out with a certain childhood friend of his. And his friend ended up giving him the PC when he got a new one. So it was already pre-owned by his friend for who knows how long, and then it was owned by my boyfriend. So I guess it just got tired of living lol.\n\nI can assure you, I want no 'sympathy donations' or pity. I wrote this post for the reason of the client and it's ancient age. It was both amazing, and surprising to see the client of a game I love dearly to exist in such a state on an old PC. I was blown away. (Idk, it  just seems awesome to me lol.)\n\nIn time, I will be able to just buy a new PC. I don't feel buying new hardware for such an old PC would be worthwhile. I've done it before and it ends up with me spending more money on fixing it that the amount becomes so close to just buying a new one in general. I appreciate the advice though, and thank you.","replies":[]}]}]}
