I think her not being able to speak is fine, but her problem currently is that because she is so in-human in both appearance and personality, she feels more like a glorified jungle monster rather than a champion. Because of this, I think her lore really need to be in first person (just like Vel'Koz and Sion). If you do the same to her as you did to Gnar's and Kalista's lores, she won't be anything else than mindless beast (which is *not* what voidborn are meant to be btw.)

It might make sense if there were any reason why the audience needed to be told that Rek'Sai is a big scary monster who eats people, but that's already quite well established.

For example:  \n\n- The rachni from mass effect are initially perceived as mindless monsters, but then you learn that they are actually very intelligent sentient creatures who communicate by songs.\n\n- The darkspawn from Dragon Age are initially presented as unknown mindless plagues, but their origin turns out to be far more messed up.  Throw in the awakening DLC plot in there for and extra good story time.\n\n- The zerg overmind is/was a very charismatic personality; without it, the race would simply not be as interesting\n\n- The witches in the Madoka anime\n\n- Song of Saya visual novel\n\n\nOf course, it depends on the context.  In some cases, details can ruin the experience (Reapers explanation in ME3)\n\n\n\nRek'Sai is a nonspeaking monster champ placed into a setting that currently doesn't exist because Riot deleted the old lore and didn't make the new one yet.
