Why isn't anyone discussing it? Why it's always a matter of how much skin female characters show? Why can guys be represented as muscled and shirtless but female wearing miniskirts are deemed \"strippers\"? Why should the profession of stripper be used as a denigrative term? Can't strippers be human being like all the rest and have a human dimension which goes beyond the act of stripping they perform at work?\nBesides, scantily clad women equating to \"strippers\" or to sexualized objects or to \"whores\" is pretty primitive and goes back to the chauvinist conception that women who dress like that are no good. Can't a woman choose how much of her body show, in which manner and what it does mean for her? Are miniskirts and cleavage showing dresses only a sign of low moral or the will to play the sexual object part? Can't a dignified and proud woman just dress however she pleases and maybe feel good about it, because she thinks she really looks beautiful that way, without having to think about people pointing her as an object?\n\nI'm a man and if I were a handsome muscled one I would have no problem showing it (not going shirtless though, we're not in a movie and scantily clad women don't do that either), but would that mean I would be a male stripper? Would that mean that I'm bending myself to the image of men the media feed us and just being an eye-candy for women?\n\nHow a person dresses and presents her-/him-self has obviously a lot of repercussions in the interactions with those surrounding said person, but it should be kept in mind that looks are not a sign of moral fibre and people should be free to express themselves with their looks as a mean of self-discovery and self-satisfaction too.","replies":[{"poster":"cshakes","date":"2014-11-20T14:44:25.569+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, [firstly](http://septembriseur.tumblr.com/post/94553353969/wow-ok-i-had-kind-of-conceptualized-that-joss), what women find attractive in men is not what men think women find attractive in men.

Citing the link you provided, it is true that Hugh Jackman bulging-veined is a sight liked by men, while a women's magazine had him rather donning a sweater and smiling, but that doesn't mean that no woman likes muscles.\nI think that the skinny, \"feminine\" type of guy a la Loki is actually more popular nowadays (especially in eastern countries), but this doesn't invalidate the fact that male characters in League have primarily two body types, muscled and skinny, and that male bodies are being objectified in advertisement just as female ones. We could argue all day whether advertisers are doing it right by understanding what women want or are just enforcing their stereotypes on society, but anyway we end at the same point: if women actually like what advertisers do, they'll keep doing it and there will be a positive feedback which will amplify the effect, if they don't and advertisers keep enforcing stereotypes there's the serious possibility for those stereotypes to be forced to become true and we're back to case A.\nI read an article some time ago explaining of a certain beer brand in the USA which through marketing imposed the view that beer should be drunk ice cold and that their beer was better because served that way. Their beer wasn't superior in taste, but serving it ice cold masks the taste and people were led into thinking ice cold is the way to drink beer and that other beers were worse because they drank them at a superior temperature, which didn't mask the taste. It doesn't matter that the other brand probably tastes worse at the same temperature, because they're the ones serving it ice-cold. You can find it [here](http://www.polygon.com/features/2013/12/2/5143856/no-girls-allowed), just ctrl+f for the beer part.

Art from different artists is obviously varied when it comes to her, but her base splash art doesn't ring any \"she's a cutie\" alarms, at least to my eyes. The first thing one notices about her is not beauty imho and I think it's probable that some men could deem her as not being beautiful at all.\nI think that champions being somewhat good-looking has deeper roots and kind of descends from the ancient concept of *καλὸς καὶ ἀγαθός* (good and handsome; second time I get to cite it on the boards xD) and classical heroes being beautiful too. There's a whole lot of cultural bias towards deformations, deviations from the norm and ugly aspects which is not a matter of sexism and indeed applies to males too.\nFor instance, orcs are your typical example of moral evil transpiring from ugly appearance. Their ugliness is a depiction of their immorality and ferality in most standard settings. Of course narrative has progressed a lot since the times when this was a strict norm and we have things such as Warcraft, where Orcs get a much more modern depiction and aren't necessarily the bad guys.\nI'd say that over the course of time we've just got to a point where main characters are generally good looking, save for those characters who have as a feature the fact of being an exception. That's because they're meant to be showcased and this is the easiest way to strike the audience and have them focus on those characters. But this isn't a matter of sexism, it applies to both sexes and to products catered for females as well.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Final GirI","date":"2014-11-19T01:14:26.061+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":3,"body":"I like the sexualization.

Piltover's forces could have a relaxed, almost plain-clothes look, especially in off-duty attire. Nowhere does it state that Caitlyn and Vi's base skins are their uniforms, it could be their favorite outfit they wear. Captain Voli and Constable Trundle are their look if they were on the force. Not Piltover's, but the American-styled police.","replies":[{"poster":"Plus50g","date":"2014-11-19T02:03:48.653+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"There classic skins are what there, cannon police suits in the world, or that would be my guess at least.

This is a fact...to not understand it, means you are literally an infant, mentally.","replies":[]},{"poster":"5G8Nri0B54","date":"2014-11-19T08:28:58.721+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"Because as we all know...people stop thinking about sex once they become adults!

I didn't buy the cait cop skin because I thought she was hot I bought it because I liked the way it looked. And it just so happened to be a stripper-cop. It doesn't fancy me an e-boner. Who really cares. We have champions like leona, strong, powerful, isn't sexually revealing in any way. And then we have vi a strong independent white piltoverian who doesn't need no man and she gets a sexualized skin and all of a sudden people treat it like its an epidemic. Its not an epidemic, its not a big deal I'm sick of these kinds of threads that come up every week.","replies":[]}]}
