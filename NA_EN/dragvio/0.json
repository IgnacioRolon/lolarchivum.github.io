Such as clicking ok i have to hover my mouse over very high\n\nCan anyone help me? This started after the windows update today i tried going back to a previous build but its still not working i do not know what fucked it up\n\n\nI have tried changing the sizes from the right click on desktop but it doesn't do anything","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-10T16:54:51.787+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did you recently update windows?
