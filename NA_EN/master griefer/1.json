I think you see different amounts based on ranking and maybe even region, so I don't doubt they are telling the truth, and good for them that they don't have to put up with the sheer volume of toxicity that some do. However, to discount people experiences just because yours is different is closed-minded and doesn't help anyone, that goes for both sides of the argument.","replies":[{"poster":"hyperion3182","date":"2020-02-18T07:18:12.612+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree there must be difference depending Region, ranks. Im saying our brains are wired to remember bad events more, hence exaggerating number and intensity of incident. Im also very confident that the ones whining the most about toxicity are toxic themselves. Of course if you are toxic you re gonna encounter more incidents than a neutral/positive player. Simply because you re gonna trigger/aggravate situations where nothing more than a \"?\" ping would have happened.\n\nWould you agree to tell us more about your different accounts and history on them? Lvl41 but I bet you are not discovering the game in 2020. Would you agree to share your last 100 chat logs? Anyone can request them via a GDPR ticket. Would you agree to make a sincere spreadsheet about all the incidents you will witness in 2020. I say \"witness\", not \"fuel\" nor \"start\".","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"hyperion3182","date":"2020-02-17T10:06:51.628+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"You have usually three types of whining around here:\n\n1/ Toxic players (usually with bans and permabanned smurfs) who are criticizing the Community or the systems without realizing they are part of the problem and not innocent witnesses. \n\n2/ Neutral players who are not breaking any rules but are completely exaggerating their issue when they post here. They have one or a few painful games and immediately \"omg worse season ever, trolls everywhere\". Confirmation bias. A few posts here or on Reddit do not represent the reality.\n\nI played 100 ARAMs and 50 ARURF recently. Thats 600 players in my team. I had to mute one griefer, I saw one \"braindead\", one \"r%%%%%\", one \"stfu\", one feeder, 5 rage quitters (compensated by AFKs in the opposing team). Thats 10 unpleasant guys out of 600. Not tragic. I invite each and everyone to do some calculation over the course of a Season.\n\nIf you dont believe me, would you believe Coca Cola, Kia, Red Bull, State Farm, American Express, even Luis Vuitton? Do you really believe they would associate their brand with a \"horrible\" Community and a company that doesnt know what they are doing? How about Rockets and Golden State or Schalke or Airbus? Would they invest? For one useless real toxic player, they know there are X times more casual players, fans, cosplayers, attendees, consumers, streamers etc.\n\n3/ Matchmaking whiners who have no idea how it works and never spent a second googling or calmly analyzing their own actions. Cognitive dissonance.\n\nSo, yeah, when somebody whines here, its about them. We provide tips and explanations.\n\n\"EASILY implement\". Yeah but no. Anyone posting \"ideas\" here havent thought about all the complexities and ripple effects of every decision, just how it would help them to get a few more LP once in a while. If there was a magical recipe to reach a perfect system, somebody would have already found it and spread in the gaming industry. If someone has a wonderful idea, so good that it would make millions for a game company, they re not on the Boards, they re already hired.","replies":[{"poster":"GatekeeperTDS","date":"2020-02-17T12:58:51.641+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"I like you.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Tele II","date":"2020-02-17T22:34:10.270+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Lol \"Riot apologists\" ...yall get so weird with your video games.","replies":[{"poster":"Aneirin","date":"2020-02-17T22:37:47.302+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Tele II,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=MQoVnqcL,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2020-02-17T22:34:10.270+0000)\n>\n> Lol \"Riot apologists\" ...yall get so weird with your video games.\n\nIt's the old \"Everyone disagrees with me... they all must be wrong\"","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"omgitsgb","date":"2020-02-18T05:59:15.355+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had someone int and troll a game recently, he  started to run it down mid, died 8 times, went afk, and then we started winning the game.
