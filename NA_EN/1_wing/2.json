Especially new conversation. Take this Azir thing:  I can see that Azir is unavailable because of a bug. However, if I want to find out if there is an update to that. . it's very difficult, because only a few comments which were posted early on and then upvoted, will be easy to find. Would new information be in an entirely new post? I don't even know where to look to find information about the game anymore.\n\nAdditionally, I feel that If, say, three people say no to a post, then the likely hood of more people looking at it declines. It's already somewhat rare for people to see posts that are anything less than very popular. I don't know what a better answer is, but I feel it's a bad choice to allow potential topics to go undiscussed because the topic is not generally very popular.","replies":[{"poster":"Kowlin","date":"2014-09-18T12:08:04.733+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel like Riot should not chase the Reddit style of forums. (I lost the official term) I'm fine with upvotting topics since that can be adjusted by changing the filters. But I don't like comment upvoting, from what I seen. This isn't an environment Reddit runs under. People will downvote good points based upon personal opinion, And I feel that this will become a problem later down the line when an unpopular opinion will get downvoted to the ground.","replies":[]},{"poster":"1 Wing","date":"2014-09-17T15:40:10.004+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yah, sure, but you have to do that all the time, so only certain people are likely to see any message I write.","replies":[{"poster":"Lumus Avatar","date":"2014-09-17T20:17:45.113+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't find that to be true.
