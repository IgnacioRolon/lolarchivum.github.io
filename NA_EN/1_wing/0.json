I was last pick, and just a little before my pick, I got a message that there was a connection error. I was disappointed that I would lose  a game for a dropped connection. Then I noticed the chat box was still updating with new message. Strangly, nothing else on my system said their was a failed connection, yet the game was unable to reconnect--though the chat was still functioning--until the final second of the countdown, when my system actually crashed [blue screen; windows XP]\r\n\r\nJust thought I would post it here :)","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2013-09-27T22:39:36.463+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey KillerStriker!\n\nI read your issue, and found it incredibly odd.  It is not uncommon for someone with an unstable connection to have issues in Champion Selection, but it is another thing entirely to have a Blue Screen at the end of it.  This strongly indicates that there is a severe corruption with your computer configuration (whether it is your OS, your harddrive, etc, etc).  Because of this, I strongly recommend that you submit a ticket to Player Support regarding this Blue Screen issue, which you can do so here:\n\nhttps://support.leagueoflegends.com/tickets/new\n\nIf you do submit a ticket, make sure that you also provide the following latest and most up to date information:\n\n1) Dxdiag information: http://support.leagueoflegends.com/entries/20100477-obtaining-a-direct-x-diagnostic-or-dxdiag\n\n2) Network Analysis: http://support.leagueoflegends.com/entries/20103436-obtaining-a-network-analysis\n\n3) NetworkInfo Log: http://support.leagueoflegends.com/entries/20132863-obtaining-a-networkinfo-log\n\n4) Process List: http://support.leagueoflegends.com/entries/20132988-obtaining-a-process-list","replies":[]}]}
