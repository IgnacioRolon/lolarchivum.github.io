Because of that, I've played a lot of games with one account.\n\nI think, the matchmaking system, sees \"this player has played many, many games: therefore, they must be very skilled. . .\" the problem is, there's a lot of smurfs, with less total games, but more honest experience, and those smurfs don't get analyzed as being the same level as me, even though they're stronger than me. There's a lot of smurfs out there! Many of my friends, have three to five accounts!\n\nSo matchmaking has a really tough time with this: numerically, I look really strong, but many people who have worse statistics, are easily stronger than me, because their numbers are spread over several accounts instead of just one.\n\nBecause so many players smurf, I'm the odd man out for not smurfing: The system expects, most players aren't smurfs, and I think, maybe most players, do smurf now a days.\n\nThat means the game, loads me into a team that mathematically looks balanced [because I, as a rare non-smurfer, have so many games played], but really: I'm not as good as many accounts that have half as much playtime!\n\nSo I feel like, matchmaking is tilted, to always give me the . . suckier team!!\n\nMany good players smurf: so their strength for matchmaking becomes kind of hidden. It's fine when there's only a few smurfs. . but I really think there's starting to be A LOT of smurfs now.\n\n\nInstead of, 20,000 players with 5000 games each, the systems sees just 100 players with 5000 games, so it assumes those 100 players are terribly OP players, when really it's because 19,900 players are hiding their statistics behind multiple accounts.\n\n\nI really feel that I, as an honest player, get the worst part of this game. . . Is this true? Is this how matchmaking operates? Because I really feel, like I get the inferior team, way more than 50% of the time. And I know, a tonne of players smurf.

Once you start ranked, the amount of smurfs drop off dramatically.  Because of that, it really really sucks for new players just trying to learn the game.  If riot made it easier for people to get level 30 accounts (say, by allowing anyone with a level 30 account to make a level 20 account instantly), it would help new players dramatically by allowing them to play with other new players instead of tons of smurfs.","replies":[{"poster":"BananaJannana","date":"2016-07-28T13:39:01.903+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is the best idea I've ever heard regarding smurfs.

In order to enter Prime matchmaking, all players must link a phone number to their account and verify that the number is theirs by entering a code (which would have been sent to their phone) into a verification page on a Riot website. Because the vast majority of people only have one phone number, they can link that to their account and won't have any problems. For smurfs, it becomes highly difficult to have more than one account without having another phone at their disposal. If someone wants to change accounts then Riot can implement a system whereby the player can switch the phone number, essentially so that they may only have one active account at any given time. This strategy is used in Google accounts to prevent people creating several alternate profiles. This won't 100% eradicate smurfing, but it will hugely cut down on the number of people doing it. \n\nTL;DR Ask for players' phone numbers: Most people have one phone number, One phone number = One account; therefore many fewer smurfs.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DiamondLeonis","date":"2016-07-28T12:51:25.366+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Smurfing has become a problem because of the ban system, a lot of people get banned for stupid reasons and no appeals, means that they have to start all over again with smurfs.
