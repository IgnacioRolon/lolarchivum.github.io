Game worked as usual. Turn off pc, turn it back on hours later and suddenly everything is slow. The lobby takes forever to load, champion select animations are literally freezing the screen, and in game I get around the 5-20 fps depending on how much is on the screen. I normally lag a bit but this is just unplayable. Any ideas?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-12T23:15:54.025+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's possible that your game assets have become corrupted.
