Secondly, Jayce's E is on a 16 second cooldown until Jayce's start leveling it, which they dont do until about lvl 14.  If a Camille uses her E (Hookshot) to engage the Jayce, shes really screwing herself over that trade unless shes going in to ult. Camille should be engaging head first, then she uses E after Jayce uses his E. \n\nAlso Jayce isnt a \"Big Play\" champion. He plays pretty bleh now due to no armor runes, Dorans Shield, heals, Resolve, and Corruption Potion + Time Warp abusers. Thats why Jayce is so bad in the top lane now is because when he goes to harass, he takes minion aggro and takes more damage than before. While the enemy that has dorans shield and or resolve basically negates any damage he deals with his autos compared to before. Junglers that gank Jayce is almost a guarantee win as well due to Jayce's lack of cc, squishyness, and mobility. \n\n>Honestly riot has overly incentived cowardice\n\nAlmost every champion in Season 8 is cowardly at the moment, so I dont understand what youre coming at here. In a season where people can get 100-0 at level 4, no wonder they play cowardly. Look at Sion, is behind and cant kill? Just ult away and youre good. Jax and behind? Just hop to a minion behind you and helicopter out. Jax and fed? Just hop to the enemy helicopter and 3 autos he dead. Wu and behind? Dash away with invisibility. Akali and behind? Shroud going invisible and wait for your jungler to come.

My Q late game has about a 9 second cooldown with cdr and goes down to about 6.50 seconds if i attack an enemy within 0.25 seconds of exiting stealth, again, oracles reveals me and Ignite gives true sight, turrets give true sight, lee sin gives true sight and many other champs have true sight too. The only other escape I can think of is my clone slowing the enemy with my E passive while I run for my life, or my clone dies and leaves boxes behind which fear the enemy if they continue to chase me. But you were missing the point of the comment I made, I have to use my escape tools to get into melee range which is already bravery, and try to kill them and proceed to run, because it's all I have left when I finish my combo, I would have to run for a full 6.50 seconds without dying or being cc'd till I can Q away to safety.","replies":[{"poster":"rtbf225618241","date":"2018-10-31T00:59:21.847+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes because everyone has to pour time and money into building tools that disable other options for counterplay completely just to counter some champion's base ability.

He has no keystones that are inherently good on him.\n\n2. Almost all of his poke, which is not only his major strength but also the only thing he has going for him, can be negated by the enemy laner taking Doran's Shield + Second Wind.\n\n3. Said poke can also be blocked by minions and costs a lot of mana if Jayce keeps spamming it.\n\n4. He barely has a passive.\n\n5. His dash requires a target, meaning he can't jump walls with it.\n\n6. His Hammer W barely does anything beyond a passive mana restore.\n\n7. Incredibly high cooldowns for someone that's supposed to consistently poke down the enemy.\n\n8. Once a Bruiser or Juggernaut gets into melee range he's done for as he has no defensive spells beyond a knockback.\n\n9. He barely has item customization as he doesn't synergize with a lot of items and is almost always relegated to build Armor Pen for his poke to deal any damage.\n\n10. Said focus on Armor Pen leaves him incredibly squishy and it's almost suicide to go into Hammer mode in a teamfight.\n\nNow what does Camille have going for her?\n\n1. At least four Keystones that are good on her (Press the Attack, Conqueror, Electrocute and Arcane Comet).\n\n2. **A free 20% maximum health shield on engage** that chooses exactly what shield would benefit her the most in that situation.\n\n3. Not one, but **TWO Auto Attack resets** that give bonus range, free movement speed and the second one **deals double the amount of damage and 40 - 100% of it is converted into TRUE DAMAGE.**\n\n4. AOE that cannot be blocked by minions, heals her, slows the enemy, and deals **percentage maximum health physical damage.**\n\n5. **TWO DASHES,** the first one having a range of 800 units and doesn't require a target, and the second one having the same range towards enemy champions, **stuns the first target hit, and grants her an Attack Speed steroid.**\n\n6. An ult that gives her **untargetability** as well as being one of if not the best lockdown tool in the game, as it creates **impassable terrain** that cannot be exit. Did I mention it also gives Camille's basic attacks **percentage health magic damage?**\n\n7. Incredible item customization. She synergizes extremely well with Trinity Force and it is her core item. She can build a wide variety of both offensive and defensive items, since he's going to deal a truckload of damage either way with her true damage as well as two different sources of percentage health damage.\n\n8. Said flexible item customization along with her free passive shield gives her incredible survivability and she almost becomes a pseudo-Tank with how hard she can be to kill.\n\n9. Literally her only counterplay is \"Just CC her\".\n\nBut sure, let's meme about how unfair Jayce is with his negligible poke and only 2/3rds of his kit **actually doing something noticeable.**","replies":[{"poster":"JAAAAAAAAAAAAYCE","date":"2018-10-29T09:24:06.153+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"You knew a lot more about Jayce than I thought you would.

(3 + 2% of missing health over 5 seconds).\n\nMissing health in this case is 200, and 4% of that is 8.\n\nThat means, in total over 10 seconds, you would've regenerated 64 health over 10 seconds, over a quarter of the damage he just dealt.\n\nChug a health potion (150 HP) and you've now healed for OVER the damage he dealt.\n\nAnd by the way, no Jayce E + Q deals 40% HP in the laning phase.\n\n> His Q alone does *way* more than what you&#x27;ll recover from those two.\n\nSure, if you have no Armor.\n\n> Even throwing {{item:3211}} and {{item:3065}} on top of that isn&#x27;t going to give you *close* to half his Q&#x27;s damage.\n\nYou'd probably be better off buying Armor to reduce the initial damage anyway.\n\n> \n> Sure, you can evade it, but it&#x27;s fast as fuck with minimal warning and huge range (EQ, that is, not just Q),\n\nOh, you mean like Camille E?\n\n> so it&#x27;s really just a matter of time before he hits you with it and takes a huge chunk of your health away.\n\nAnd that's basically his only strength.\n\nHe takes a chunk of your health and then nothing else.\n\nHe's probably not going to kill you unless you walk into him or you are alone.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"hält die fresse","date":"2018-10-30T04:35:20.312+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i dont think you understand this post","replies":[{"poster":"Warlord Rhinark","date":"2018-10-30T07:06:54.036+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=hält die fresse,realm=NA,application-id=Ir7ZrJjF,discussion-id=YhEnjbpj,comment-id=00020002,timestamp=2018-10-30T04:35:20.312+0000)\n>\n> i dont think you understand this post\n\nA meme is supposed to be funny.\n\nThis is not funny.","replies":[{"poster":"hält die fresse","date":"2018-10-30T22:32:49.587+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you seem to be in the minority","replies":[{"poster":"Warlord Rhinark","date":"2018-10-31T07:24:03.796+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=hält die fresse,realm=NA,application-id=Ir7ZrJjF,discussion-id=YhEnjbpj,comment-id=0002000200000000,timestamp=2018-10-30T22:32:49.587+0000)\n>\n> you seem to be in the minority\n\nI'd hazard a guess and say that the people here don't find it funny, they just like to hate on Jayce.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Vlada Cut","date":"2018-10-30T13:49:08.897+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Warlord Rhinark,realm=EUW,application-id=Ir7ZrJjF,discussion-id=YhEnjbpj,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2018-10-28T20:12:04.969+0000)\n>\n> Jayce is a billion times better than Camille.\n\nLOL what a joke.\nCamille is better designed gameplay and lorewise.
