If you are a coach and you are creating a ban strategy for facing 2 teams, one with a bronze 4 mid and on with a challenger mid. Both of them play Ryze consistently, but there are clear differences in skill between the two players. Are you going to want the challenger on Ryze? No. Will you really care if the bronze gets ryze?
