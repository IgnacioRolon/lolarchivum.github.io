And there&#039;s a good reason why people don&#039;t want it. Some are riot&#039;s issue. Some aren&#039;t. I&#039;ll be discussing most of the issues support players have.\n\n- ADC\n\nAs a support, you&#039;re heavily reliant on your ADC for your laning phase. But there are times where your adc is trash and it really turns into a 1v2 lane. ADCs can sometimes be a bit too spoil and always expect their supports to die for them and all that stuff. When the supports do peel. The ADC doesn&#039;t say anything. When the support doesn&#039;t peel well for decent purposes (e.g. mana, ultimate cooldown, summoner spell cooldown, item cooldown) the ADC flames. Your team pays attention to the ADC and not you (the support) for helping them and thinking you did nothing.\n\n- Laning Phase\n\nMost supports, with a small exception of Shen. Has weak early laning phase because of mana. The only way to fix that, is either A) Biscuit delivery rune from inspiration, or B) get mana items. The biscuit delivery is very helpful but doesn&#039;t give you enough of those. And the second one requires gold. Most support players will take last chapter or Tear. But it requires gold. And your gold income items don&#039;t give you all that much. But since your ADC will flame most of the time for taking their cs no matter how trash they are. This could be an issue. ADCs just have to spend their resources for poking. while the support has to spend resources on poking AND healing/shielding. \n\n-Riot&#039;s Problem\n\nWith the removal of ultimate hat, which sorcery is a common primary rune for supports mostly due to summon aery. Ultimate reliant supports like Soraka, Lux, Karma, Jana, Sona, Thresh and many more are taken a hard hit. Ultimate hat was a prefered option for supports looking for a late game buff with their ultimate from 120 seconds to less than 60 that can help greatly in 1v1 (Lux and Thresh), or in laning phase (Karma), and most importantly, in Team Fights (Janna, Sona, Karma, Soraka, etc). And while the replaced rune, Nimbus Cloak can be effective on Rakan. That&#039;s pretty much it. The only other ultimate cooldown is presence of mind. But the only support that can wield its precision rune tree is lux. The other one that could be a tiny bit better is to reduce gold income items from 350 to 250. That means there&#039;s 250 left and supports can buy a full total of 5 potions instead of 3. Also, please buff gold generation items, they really do sort of suck.","replies":[{"poster":"Bottom Laner","date":"2018-06-03T06:03:50.288+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I play both ADC and support and completely disagree with this.

They cost way too much mana for its value. Heck, I think a maxed out Fiora Q cost the same than a  Rakan tier 1 q. But you gotta respect grand entrance though. The other weakness for Rakan is simply banning Xayah. Although played with Miss Fortune. It is still quite uncommon for a Rakan player to play without Xayah primarily because of his E.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
