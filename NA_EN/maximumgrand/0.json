Every time I restart my PC (and sometimes the client) it does this weird thing where anytime I get to champion selection in any game mode the client displays a solid black screen with the current version on the top left of the page and the friend list icons at the bottom right. I can't interact with anything, and eventually it times out and sends me back to the home page of the client for not picking a champ. It also does this with draft pick, except the black screen is where I would select my two roles. Every time I've been able to fix it by using the Hextech Repair Tool that I downloaded from the main website and having it force a repatch, but I've had to do this at least once literally every day this week. I don't know what the problem is, and the Alt+enter thing doesn't do anything about this since I'm not in ful lscreen during champion selection.\r\n\r\nAgain, I can temporarily fix it by just running the Hextech Repair Tool but I'm honestly getting annoyed at having to sit and wait for 20 minutes every day to repatch it. I have the logs from the repair tool.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-17T19:12:34.793+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Black screens like that occur when you fail to download assets, meaning your network might be losing connection or holding steady.
