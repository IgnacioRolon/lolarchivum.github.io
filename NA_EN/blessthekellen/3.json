It's really starting to grow on my nerves since no sound is really a pretty big disadvantage since you can't hear pings and ability sounds.\n\nEdit: Around 15-20 minutes in it starts","replies":[{"poster":"Çhåryzård","date":"2016-04-16T16:15:44.090+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Strangerrr8,realm=NA,application-id=LqLKtMpN,discussion-id=rmwILoEu,comment-id=00000001,timestamp=2016-04-16T15:26:19.814+0000)\n>\n> The bug is that when playing league on a Mac with sound on, around 15-20 minutes in teamfights and skirmishes the fps drops to 3~5.

I'll compare it to someone who lost their voice. See what I mean?

In fact, over the weekend I linked to [the latest update](http://boards.euw.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-reports-eu/jT9W0Jc1-16-04-16-update-on-mac-performance-issue) - \n\n*While it may not impact you directly, I just wanted to give an update on where we're at with this one. Right now, we've deployed a potential fix to PBE and early indicators are positive - but we need to get more feedback to confirm if this has returned performance back to previous levels.*\n\n*If you have a PBE account, it'd be awesome if you could test a game or two on there to see if your performance is any better and provide feedback. For now, we're targeting this to be released with 6.8 - this is assuming the fix is indeed improving performance, and also that there are no adverse affects/impact from this fix. Feedback for those of you with a PBE account can either be provided here, or directly on the PBE boards themselves.*\n\n*Thanks for your patience on this one - we'll hopefully have you guys up and running at full performance (with audio!) with this fix.*\n\n**TL;DR, we're looking to get this in for patch 6.8.**\n\nAlso, I apologize for the bit of silence - I was OOO for a family emergency last week, and didn't have consistent access to the boards.

(Testing on PBE is better than testing in-house 'cause it's a cooked build, and more similar to what we would push to live) Based on that, we were fairly confident that this issue would be resolved.\n\nHowever, that doesn't appear to be the case. (Obviously.)\n\nFrom what I understand, we will be making a post in Help & Support soon, looking for more information from you guys to help us figure out what the heck is going on.
