So after the bug was fixed the work done on PBE and now live seems to have done a pretty good job at getting rid of the major fps issues. I was once on Very low with about 40 frames but now I can play high-very high again with 60-70 frames. The weird non-ping related/non-frame related stuttering is at a minimal and frames drops are also not as bad but could still use a bit of improvement. The one big issue, however, is that frames tend to slowly drop during the course of the game, if the game lasts longer than 35-40 minutes they tend to be down in the ~20 range. This happens no matter what setting I have the game. I was thinking it could be a memory leak? I don't know but thanks for looking into the issues with mac users.\n\n Mid-2013 Macbook Air\nOSX: 10.11.4 El Capitan\nGPU: Intel HD 5000 1536 MB\nCPU: 1.3GHz Intel core i5\nRAM: 4GB 1600 MHz","replies":[]},{"poster":"blessthekellen","date":"2016-04-22T02:46:36.406+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have two systems with this problem so here at the specs as follows:\n\nMid 2009 Macbook Pro\nOSX Version 10.11.4 El Capitan\n2.26 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo\n8GB Ram \nNVIDIA GeForce 9400M 256 MB\n\n\nLate 2012 Mac Mini\nOSX Yosemite\nI5 2.5Ghz Core 2 Duo\n8GB Ram\nHD Graphics 4000 1500MB\n\n\nI played 3 games since the update on the Macbook Pro and 3 on the Mac mini.

I encounter this bug consistently in the mid-late game when there are team fights going on anywhere on the rift consisting of 4 players or more. When the error occurs, the minion movement and animation stops, and all champion ability animations stop. However, I can still move my champion around the rift, and see my health go up and down, I can also cast abilities, but there are no visual indications of the casting. My champion moves, and the mana goes away, but theres no visual indication that the ability was cast. Likewise, I can place wards, but the ward never leaves my inventory, despite illuminating the surrounding fog of war. Once the team fight stops, my game jumps over the action that occurred during the latency/lag/bug and my game begins to respond again, with animations and sounds restored.\n\nThis error does not occur during the laning phase when last hitting minions with only one or two other champions on screen besides myself. Based on this performance, the bug seems to be related to when many champion abilities are cast at once. This bug began in patch 6.6 for me, and I had never encountered this bug before between patches 5.20 and 6.6.\n\nHope this helps, thank you for the hard work you guys are doing. I appreciate it.

The major problem now is that there is lag/bug that happens periodically where the ping and framerate does not drop, the game just ceases to respond to player movement or buttons while everything else seems to be running normally. Please continue to work on these bug issues for Mac users, Riot. Thanks.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BADxW0LF","date":"2016-04-20T18:29:09.509+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":8,"body":"> We have been constantly asking for updates\n\nAnd that's everyone's freakin problem!  Do you realize how many effing posts there are regarding this?  All of you just flood the boards instead of giving one post a crap ton of upvotes.  If it were me, I would ignore all of you and reply to just ONE thread.  I don't know how Katey does it, but she seems to have the patience to not be annoyed by how many whiny babies we have here.  Very few of you act like adults and it is depressing.  \n\nIn my opinion, all of you just want the \"achievement\" of having a Rioter comment on your post.  You don't get anything for it!  No RP/IP/LP...nothing!  \n\nSeriously, none of you seem to read the Red Tracker.  Easiest place to find answers from Rioters is there!  They have responded to this issue days ago.  Learn to research.","replies":[{"poster":"blessthekellen","date":"2016-04-20T18:35:33.473+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"What works better in a protest or rally. One gigantic sign.
