As for picking a better champ to lane against Kat, a large part of the community still plays blind picks and/or teambuilder, meaning they aren't always going to pick a champ to lane against Kat.  Any IN GAME advice can just be countered by a slightly better team.\n\nThe problem is in Kat's kit.  She's  very powerful with a lower skill cap compared to all the other AP assassins.  Her ult is very easy to use, unless you specifically save whatever CC you MIGHT have for her, but even that isn't a promise, since getting any kills or assists get's her her ult back in a hurry.  A smart player knows she will pretty much always be focused, so won't initiate until it's safe to sweep.\n\nThe problem though, is that if you take any part of her kit away, you ruin Kat (community uproar) and make her unplayable.  Compared to the other AP assassins, she has no real defensive abilities other than Shunpo, which IS fairly powerful as a counter to initiation.  Her kit is ALL damage output and her passive is about getting that damage output off CD.  Nerfing her early game can totally ruin her late game by making her under fed, since, as a melee champ, she has trouble farming against ranged champions unless she can keep them in check, which for her is to keep them in kill range.  Nerfing her late game means she HAS to feed or basically be useless late game.\n\nI don't know how to balance it, or make her better, and to claim to just remove her is not ever going to happen.  So, idk, learn to play Kat well enough that you know how to beat her with anybody.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"LadyRenly","date":"2015-03-25T18:27:19.997+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't even play Katarina, and I hate the tryhards who use her all day, but nah. She is not \"a cancer\". She's really not hard to lane against, even moreso now. She is trash tier compared to Urgot or Leblanc or even Morgana. She's strong, but she has many weaknesses to counterbalance it, it's completely fair. All it is is a matter of bullying her, backing off so she doesn't shunpo your minion, and denying her kills, and call MIA when she disappears(she'll give up on you and want to snowball desperately and go to a different lane)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Korkalek","date":"2015-03-25T16:59:10.589+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"At low Elo she's not a problem either.

So irritating to keep her down early and still watch her get a catch here or there and turn into a monstrosity. \n\nHad the best luck with Annie vs Kat just to counter explode her when she tried to go in.\n\nAlso you have a point about the simplicity of playing Kat. I haven't played Kat in probably 5-6 months and I bet I could pick her into whatever in solo Q and carry my nuts off.","replies":[]},{"poster":"hubisoon","date":"2015-03-25T14:30:49.646+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well i wanted to add that people whine about how riven is op which isnt true becouse shes 1.
