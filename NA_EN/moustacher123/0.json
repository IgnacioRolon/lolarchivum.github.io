This could be a combination of reasons, like a security setting preventing files from being used properly, or even bad settings/drivers.  Mae sure your OS is up to date, and try the steps in our [permissions](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) guide to make sure league has access to be read properly.
