So I figured I would start a bit differently, that is, to show how I personally understand Mordekaiser&#039;s theme and character, as well as what kind of champion I would prefer to see him become. That way, since a Morde rework is likely somewhere in the future (SoonTM), a rioter could look at this and at least get an decent idea of what some people in the community think of **The Master of Metal**\r\n\r\nTo me, Morde is, in essence, darkness, death, and destruction while there&rsquo;s death(or power) metal playing in the background as if his whole being is that of some epic, powerful montage. He&rsquo;s crazy powerful and crazy hard to outright kill, thus one has to be smart in deciding how to approach him. Morde *wants* you to fight him, he wants your *entire team* to try and fight him, and he wants to laugh in your face as he takes 3 of your teammates to the grave and walks away in slow motion. To me, Morde is basically a Sion who decided to ignore the path of CC and go for raw damage, smashing people into the ground and conquering their souls.\r\n\r\nDespite all his strength, Morde has glaringly obvious weaknesses: he has no CC to lock people in place or even slow them down so he can obliterate them, and he has no means of closing the gap or escaping should he need to. I think being the only champion with no mobility or CC is essential to his character and playstyle, and I would hate to see that about him changed. That being said, it is almost always a better idea to attempt to turn a fight around, even when outnumbered/outmatched, than it is to run because you aren&rsquo;t going to get very far.\r\n\r\nGiven that, here&rsquo;s a proposed rework I threw together. There are no numbers, as numbers are not the issue; the important thing is that the basics of his kit and playstyle are understood.\r\n_________\r\n**Passive &ndash;** Mordekaiser converts a percentage of the magic damage he deals into a shield (less effective for minions and monsters) that decays over time. Mordekaiser can overcharge his shield, healing him based on a percentage any &ldquo;extra&rdquo; damage dealt.\r\n_________\r\n**Q &ndash;** Mordekaiser is slowed while charging. Mordekaiser smashes his mace onto the ground, dealing flat damage to all enemies hit in a large area.  Mordekaiser deals additional damage and percent current/total/missing health damage based on how long it was charged.\r\n_________\r\n**W &ndash; Passive:** Mordekaiser gains bonus Armor, scaling with his ability power. Killing an enemy champion increases this by a flat amount.\r\n**Active:** Mordekaiser gets a spell shield for a short duration, blocking the next enemy spell that hits him. If Mordekaiser successfully blocks a spell, Mordekaiser sends a blast of metal to the enemy whose spell was blocked, dealing damage over the next several seconds and shredding their magic resist of that champion and nearby enemy champions over the duration.\r\n_________\r\n**E &ndash;** Mordekaiser sends out a wave of metal and darkness, dealing damage and marking all champions hit for several seconds. Hitting a marked enemy with a basic attack or Q will consume the mark, reducing Mordekaiser&rsquo;s cooldowns by a small amount.\r\n_________\r\n**R &ndash; Passive:** Mordekaiser feeds off of pain, gaining increased ability power every time he takes damage from an enemy champion, to a cap.\r\n**Active:** Mordekaiser curses an enemy champion, draining a percentage of their health over the next several seconds. If the target dies while afflicted, Mordekaiser gains control of the enemy&rsquo;s soul for the next several seconds, giving it increased damage based on Mordekaiser&rsquo;s ability power.","replies":[{"poster":"Venowolf","date":"2015-05-02T01:29:48.863+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mordeaiser = lack mobiity and no cc.","replies":[]},{"poster":"junglerboy16","date":"2015-05-01T21:53:24.932+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The passive change seems counter intuitive. The whole point of his shield is that it converts the health cost into damage and effective health. Having it actually restore health to him completely defeats the purpose of his passive's interaction with health costs to begin with. His current passive is already strong and well balanced.\n\nQ feels like a clone of Sion's Q, and as such feels really unoriginal. I do like the idea of charging an ability for bonus % HP damage, but I don't think it should be an AoE ground targeted nuke like this, because it is too similar to an already existing ability.\n\nI just don't like W at all. If you are trying to make him a bruiser, this feels totally out of place since it would make enemies target someone else. If you are making him a mage still, this is far inferior to his current W's AoE damage and shield generation.\n\nE feels incredibly archaic, like a lot of abilities from back in season 1 and 2, and I don't think this kind of flat CD reduction fits thematically or gameplay-wise in his kit.\n\nHis current R already got fixed to be in a reasonable spot, and this change muddies that all over again...","replies":[{"poster":"F1eshandB1ood","date":"2015-05-01T22:33:43.428+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">The passive change seems counter intuitive.

Having it actually restore health to him completely defeats the purpose of his passive's interaction with health costs to begin with. His current passive is already strong and well balanced.\n\nThe only reason Morde's passive isn't completely broken is because 1) It's gated entirely by his cooldowns, no cooldowns = no shield and 2) the fact that he has to hard shove any lane that he is in or be in the middle of a trade to get the shield to begin with. People complain about Morde not having a means of self sustain outside of the somewhat long cooldown on his ult despite having health costs (in fact Morde is the only champion in the game that has no way to account for health costs in his basic kit except for his ult)\n\nWhat this does is give him access to that sustain, but in order to get it, he has to shove the lane even harder and fight more, meaning he can't just heal all over the place with no consequences. Not only that, but it forces those that he is laning against to actually try and fight him in order to prevent him from healing (more interaction in lane). Plus, it always annoyed me how in teamfights i could deal quite a bit of damage to several enemy champs but all of that \"extra\" damage go to waste, so to speak, since my shield was immediately stocked, this change would give him a little room in that regard.\n\n> Q feels like a clone of Sion's Q, and as such feels really unoriginal. I do like the idea of charging an ability for bonus % HP damage, but I don't think it should be an AoE ground targeted nuke like this, because it is too similar to an already existing ability.\n\nI can understand where you are coming from regarding his Q looking kind of like a clone, if there's a better way to have this fit in themetically, then I'm all for it.\n\n>  I just don't like W at all. If you are trying to make him a bruiser, this feels totally out of place since it would make enemies target someone else. If you are making him a mage still, this is far inferior to his current W's AoE damage and shield generation.\n\nPersonally, I do like Morde as a bruiser-ish champion. I feel \"being tanky by building damage\" is a huge part of his playstyle, and if he's built glass cannon mage, there's not much way that can be done and still have him be balanced (remember the Diana glory days? building straight damage and then 2-shotting half the enemy team is no fun, especially since no one could kill you with that shield). I personally want Morde to be tanky; I don't want him to 2 shot people and survive a hit or two, I want him to hit hard and be almost unkillable. But that may just be my take on him. The spell shield would be just like Nocturne's or Sivir's, last just long enough for you to have to time it properly, and can mitigate some CC to charge your Q. If anything, that would cause *even more* people to focus you in order to prevent that nuke from going off.\n\n> E feels incredibly archaic, like a lot of abilities from back in season 1 and 2, and I don't think this kind of flat CD reduction fits thematically or gameplay-wise in his kit.\n\nI kind of wanted e to be less of a \"press a button, deal damage\" spell. As stated earlier, Morde's defensive capabilities are gated almost entirely by his cooldowns, so for a while he just kind of sits in a fight and pokes people with his stick until his cooldowns come back up or he dies from a lack of shield. I wanted some form of cooldown reduction put into his kit (that isn't necessarily a reset) that allows him to *keep fighting* as long as he is in combat. The result you see is what I came up with. If there is a better way to implement that, I'm all ears.\n\n> His current R already got fixed to be in a reasonable spot, and this change muddies that all over again...\n\nIt's true the recent changes to Morde's ult certainly were kind to him (and not broken against opponents) but at the same time I feel Rito puts waaaaaay too much emphasis on Morde's ult. His ult should be used to either get some sustain in a fight and/or to get the ghost, but at the same time the majority of Morde's power should not be loaded into that one skill. I don't want Morde to just sit around in a fight waiting for someone to get low so he can ult and have that be all he's good for. I would rather them nerf his ult and buff other areas of his kit.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Meserion","date":"2015-05-01T20:50:19.975+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"looks pretty cool actually, but I don't think he should get free armor from his W, one of his big weaknesses has always been physical damage dealers and this change would make him very tanky in that area while still doing a lot of damage.\n\nAs a suggestion maybe his Q instead applies a 2 second AoE slow of like 30% at the location where Morde slams down. That would give him some CC that I feel he desperately needs.","replies":[]}]}
