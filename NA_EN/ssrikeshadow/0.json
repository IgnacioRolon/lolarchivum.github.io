At minimum you would need to play 138 custom games to lvl 6 to even try all the abilities and that doesn&#039;t account for scaling which varies greatly from champion to champion nor does it account for the fact that you would have to own all or nearly all 138.\n\nFor instance, if don't know Zyra, then you don't know to crush her plant seeds. If you don't know Rammus, then you don't know how much damage he returns to an ADC that hits him - I've seen numerous ADCs kill themselves hitting him.\n\nCompare that to a classic game that is considered very complex - Chess. Chess has 6 different pieces and each with much less complexity than any single champion in League of Legends. Yet Chess is very very difficult to master.\n\nI will admit that the 5 bans (from 3 before) does help, but only if you know which champions to ban. However, autofill counters those 5 bans very heavily.","replies":[{"poster":"Kaìju","date":"2017-09-11T21:29:57.352+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's almost like League isn't a casual game for casual gamers.","replies":[{"poster":"SSrikeShadow","date":"2017-09-11T22:24:51.030+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"That is true lol.

League was made to be complex because PC gaming is more of a hardcore audience. No casual gamer would pay to build a gaming rig, it's why the PC Master Race idea exists. But with League gaining popularity and it's ease of play on a toaster it was only a matter of time before more casuals entered. I play with kids playing Team Death Match.

A champion will always _play_ the same way; items, on the other hand, bog down with a lot of reading and sifting to the point that people are now ignoring it because there's just too much nerd shit to pull through for them, I guess.\n\nLeague has a lot of problems, though, and roster size is more a symptom than a problem. We could engage this discussion, but it'd be pretty windy. The short of it is that the bigger problem is how some older concepts are completely anachronistic (Udyr is my red flag here), where they're almost from a different game they're so absurdly juxtaposed in the meta. Combined with having to constantly re-look everything when changing one thing, there's a lot that League could serve to trim to make that 130+ roster blend together a lot less.","replies":[{"poster":"SSrikeShadow","date":"2017-09-11T23:38:47.228+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah the items are something else entirely add runes and masteries to round out the complexity and it's insane.

Improvement is glacial speed. I tried playing every champ once in bots A-Z and it took me 3 days just to get down to Galio.","replies":[]}]}
