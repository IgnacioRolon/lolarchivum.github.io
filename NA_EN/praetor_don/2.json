Their game uses a free-to-play model, supported by microtransactions rather than ads or boxed copy sales.\n\n>In 2008, Riot Games obtained initial funding of US$7 million provided by venture capital firms Benchmark Capital and FirstMark Capital.[10] In a second round of funding in 2009, the company raised $8 million from Benchmark, FirstMark, and Chinese technology giant Tencent Holdings.[11][12] In early 2011, Tencent Holdings bought out a majority stake in Riot Games.[13] Tencent later reported the deal was for $231,465,000 in an interim report.[14]\n\n\nI said they were funded by the Chinese... by a significant amount, which lead to a complete takeover.  Although the details of the deal is not public of course it is clear that it was conditional funding.  Once LOL took off as a game they bought out the rest of the stake.\n\nAs you can see in the second round of funding they received a significant source from China.  It was not a majority state alas a significant minority stake.  Because the company is owned by many parties that leads to a plurality or otherwise effect.  So although they did not have outright control, they had enough private control to dicate future of company.\n\nIn the end, because China was involved early; as my premise had stated previously, had NA region not have materialized (nobody in USA played LOL) but yet KOrea and others did the game would have simply moved overseas.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Lugg","date":"2015-10-13T21:46:21.631+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"All the regions have gotten closer this year to being on Korea's level.
