I had a nice team, they played way better than them, thier top sucked hard, then the match started going like this: Kog walks with Lulu behind, she spams abilities on him, Kog wins everything.\nLiterally a joke of a match ruined by this.\nAnd kog had the pug skin, which made it even more cancerous.\n\nIt's broken, needs a fix, this is what i'm saying.","replies":[{"poster":"Warios","date":"2018-02-03T01:45:38.432+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=carcaroff,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=7O9LYEUA,comment-id=0000000000000000,timestamp=2018-02-03T01:06:14.297+0000)\n>\n> Kog + Lulu...it&#x27;s broken, i saw it before and now happened again, so it&#x27;s definitely a thing.

Is a factor in the games outcome as well, lulu with a 70% win rate, running a streak as well.\n\nBTW, what champs did you ban if you hate Kog/Lulu so much?","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
