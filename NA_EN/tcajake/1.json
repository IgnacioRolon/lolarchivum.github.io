The issue is that The side buttons on my Steel Series Rival are not working within League anymore, and haven't been since the recent windows update.  The only solution I have found is to roll back my windows to a previous version.  There are people with many different models of mouses having these same issues posting on the old post.  I am starting this thread to get some eyes on the issue I have submitted a ticket and will update if I find a better solution.  If anyone knows of a better way to fix it please let me know.\n\n\n***UPDATE***\nthey told me to use the hextech repair tool and closed my ticket..... just reopened it hopefully this time I get a better response.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-05T22:36:55.404+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have heard from a good number of players that the Windows Creator Update had been preventing them from using the side mouse buttons for awhile now. Typically, reverting the Windows version has fixed it so it seems like it's an issue centered around the update. Honestly, your ticket might be your best bet, since those tech guys know an awful lot more than I do tbh.","replies":[{"poster":"TCAJake","date":"2017-06-06T03:16:03.736+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thanks, I just was trying to get some more eyes on the issue with this post mainly as well as see if anyone else has a solution.","replies":[]}]}]}
