But witnessing his gameplay he is doesn`t act like one. More like a rugby player tbh. Don`t get me wrong, I already know riot mentioned that he is considered as a beefy ninja but still, they should have made him a bit more convincing that he is a ninja since there is nothing worth mentioning on his kit that is ninjalike( Ninjalike = Shuriken, Clone jutsus that turns into wood logs, Mimics walls for stealth,  etc). Even his quotes doesn`t make sense with how he functions.( \"You are already dead, you just havent caught up yet\")......this quote would suit more to zed because of his ult if you ask me. I want to immerse as one if i want to play one..... but man its more like im playing football with this champ instead. Image ruined.\r\n\r\nOh and just to let you guys know, I am aware that there are most of you who likes the current Shen and I respect that. This is just me sharing my honest opinions of how could a ninja be like since I am into those kinds of stuff. If there is something in my text that you might found offensive or not exactly correct then i truly apologize for that. And with all that, have a nice day.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-08-18T21:42:52.782+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ninjas dont have to be narutards.","replies":[{"poster":"Terumie","date":"2018-08-18T21:51:23.579+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MagicFlyingLlama,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=rI3bZQaN,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2018-08-18T21:42:52.782+0000)\n>\n> Ninjas dont have to be narutards.\n\nOf course they dont, surely we would acknowledge a ninja that would expose itself on the frontline,taunting the crowd and just get beaten up by them on purpose instead......idk anymore.{{sticker:zombie-nunu-bummed}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Crimson Zeppelin","date":"2018-08-19T02:50:12.614+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Traditionally, ninjas were mostly samurai on certain missions.

Bushido was a code of honor made up after the warring ages when the Tokugawa shogunate took over. And was much more talked about in the Meiji era after the samurai class was disbanded. As a moral guidance for finesse.\nSamurai's hired mercenaries from other clans. All your other statements of stealth missions with hooded men are fantasy. And there is no such thing as \"Ninja temples\". Those are fortified monasteries for warrior monks during the age of religious strife where they nearly had the same political power as samurais.\n\nThis is the most famous \"Ninja\". Hattri Hanzo.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hattori_Hanz%C5%8D\n\nHe is clearly stated as a samurai warrior that fought with the shogun with many occasions out in the open as bodyguard.

His ultimate might be the most naruto-y ability as he channels a short period, presumably using a ninjutsu of some sort, to instantly travel to a location. Since he is Ionian instead of Asian it is logical to assume they would develope different ways and shapes to forge a blade. This is possible because they and the societies in Runeterra may hace developed differently from us on Earth, though therere many similarities. Perhaps it is the Ionians that created scimitar like weapons since there is no mention of any civilization that resembles the middle east (I am excluding skins such as sultan gangplank or tryndamere since skins exist in a reality of their own, I am mainly focusing on the reality that “default” skins reside in as that is what,the game mainly takes place in).","replies":[{"poster":"ExcaliberSlayer","date":"2019-01-13T17:23:09.488+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mhmm I agree with this statement.
