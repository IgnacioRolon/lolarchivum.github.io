Thing is though, I thought it was the PBE and I was really excited. I've looked up how to get access but I can't find anything, nor can I find anything on if the PBE is actually integrated into the Alpha Client.

The alpha client is the entirely new client that is in testing that will tie to your actual account. The PBE system is an entirely separate server that receives balance and some content releases for testing before they hit the live servers. If you haven't applied for PBE access yet, you can do so [here.](https://pbesignup.euw.leagueoflegends.com/en/pbe)\n\nLet me know if you have any additional questions.","replies":[{"poster":"Cheekynorth","date":"2016-07-28T17:40:32.603+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Whenever I click on that link and then try to sign up for it, it sends me to an error page.
