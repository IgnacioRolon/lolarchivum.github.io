She does not interact with you in lane at all, because she doesn't need to. She just needs to know how to safely shove.\n\nOnce she gets her W, there are times when not only is she uninteractive because she's afk shoving, but she's also uninteractive because you can't go up to the creeps or she'll hard outtrade you.\n\nOnce she hits 6, she has the potential to 100-0 you. A lot of assassins do as well. But here's the thing.\n\n-Assassins generally pay for it by being melee, easy to poke down, or by being susceptible to jungle ganks\n-Assassins have significantly lower uptime on their all in windows. Fizz all in, while shorter relative to all other champions, still is on a ~90 second CD because he's reliant on his ultimate. Zoe's relies on a good summoner spell and her R to reposition. That's pretty ubiquitous for an all in.\n-Zoe can attack you from all sorts of angles due to her E's wall range, and R.\n-Zoe can do this, safely, every 12-15 seconds, even if it doesn't go smoothly.\n\nAgainst most champions, the idea is you need to do one of the above.\n-Out-roam\n-Out wave-control\n-Out-trade\n-Out-poke\n\nThe champion throws away all logic of wave control in half+ of her matchups, out-pokes you, has those pokes turn into all ins that are stronger than most poke mages' all ins, and can out-roam you because you're forced to take safe routes to not get hit by her all in/bubble on your way there, what are you supposed to do? Dopa recognized it. Most casters and players in the pro scene recognize it.

It's as if someone was only interested in gaming the champion creation process and making a champ as broken as possible while pretending the design makes rational sense (but ofc as stated, those reasoning can be observed as highly contrived and cynical), than actually produce a champ that makes gameplay sense.\n\nZoe is the biggest design failure League of Legends can possibly make, with no contest, because she embodies basically everything that shouldn't exist in a League champ all on herself. Champs like Zoe should not have existed. The kit is so much of a problem even as an idea, the fact her kit even made past the drawing board is something Riot's design team should be ashamed about.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Psyrix","date":"2019-01-20T14:44:20.110+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Zoe doesn’t need nerfs, nor do I think they are actually gonna go through (cuz they were removed afaik), however ur way of reasoning this is and and explaining to the community absolutely incorrect and provocative/instigating.  \n\nZoe is pretty balanced rn, however being hit by e doesn’t mean u deserve to die, it means Zoe deserves the right to try and offload all her damage onto you, with there still being ways for u to work around it.
