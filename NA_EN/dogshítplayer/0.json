Since patch 6.9 myself and many other users are experiencing frequent lag spikes in game of up to 200-500. Even my use on this website is affected by lag issues but I am not having difficulty on any other web or game service. The game isn't playable right now for me. I have confidence that Riot will fix it, but many people are posting about it in threads right now and I haven't seen any notice put out that they are aware its a serious issue affecting this many people. I would really like to.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Draginath","date":"2016-05-06T02:08:22.421+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This happens to me to.

Make sure to complete all of the steps in our [Connection Issues Article](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues).
