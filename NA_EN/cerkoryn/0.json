I must be doing something wrong because it doesn&#039;t seem to work for me.  Here&#039;s what I am trying to do in lane:\r\n\r\n1.  Put E on their ADC and then 2 AAs. (2 stacks on E)\r\n2.  Rocket Jump on top and slightly behind their ADC. (3 Stacks on E)\r\n3.  R them back toward my tower/teammates. (4th stack on E and detonation)\r\n\r\nWhat I am expecting at this point is to get a reset on my W so that I can hop back to safety/onto their exposed ADC, pick up the kill, get another reset, and then hop again to wherever I need, but I don&#039;t seem to be getting the reset after my E detonates.  Am I doing something wrong?","replies":[{"poster":"IronwallJackson","date":"2015-11-25T04:46:51.245+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you sure you're getting the detonate at full stacks? I've been grinding out games with Trist this past week and haven't had any issues with her W reset.\n\nAlso, how do you feel about her W resets being a thing? I think I preferred the way her W and E used to lower each other's cooldowns instead of the preseason change, but I don't know.","replies":[{"poster":"Cerkoryn","date":"2015-11-25T05:26:24.847+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well as long as the W and R each count as a stack, it should be full stacks.  Maybe I'm just barely missing the hitbox for my W by jumping too far behind?  It still detonates when I hit the R though.\n\nI like the new W resets, makes her a top tier ADC but requires a high level of mastery.  Better than Sivir and Jinx last season who were OP at any ELO even if you were mediocre with them.","replies":[]}]}]}
