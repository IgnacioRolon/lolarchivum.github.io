The IP system has been changed about a week ago and is now replaced with Blue Essence. I played only a few co-op rounds ever and got myself to have about 700 IP which has been converted to Blue Essence it seems. \nNow as I play again I'm not earning any Blue Essence. I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do to unlock new characters, I'm not quite ready for playing actual matches and was planning on grinding out to buy a character or 2 with IP but now that I'm not getting my game win IP / Blue Essence I have no way of getting champs. I have yet to get even a single Blue Essence\n\nIs there something specific I should be doing? I don't have $ to put into this game - its free - that's why I started playing it\n\nTL:DR;\nIt's hard to get new champions as a new player when the system involves getting Mastery with champions to get new ones but you don't have BE to get them to begin with. What do I do?","replies":[{"poster":"JelQQING","date":"2017-11-14T01:37:00.733+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"earning IP was already slow, new players dont have champs to earn mastery chests with","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-14T02:10:01.705+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Not at first, but you can easily buy some of the cheaper champs after only 1 level up. Not all of the rewards are going to come quickly.

It seems I'm just going to have to put a lot of effort into it to just get over a sort of 'bridge' and when I do it may or may not be easier.\n\nOnly downside I see is it makes it completely impossible for filthy casuals like myself who want to play co-op over pvp but that's something I'll just have to get across when I feel I'm ready I guess.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-13T22:29:42.906+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":10,"body":"So no you don't get blue essence after every match now, but that's because there are already other ways of getting it. First up, you can still get chests for free by earning mastery chests with champions and getting capsules and such on levelups. On top of this, you now get capsules with champion shards each time you levelup, and there's no maximum level now!\n\nIt feels a lot slower, but looking at all of the [**posts from Rioters like Cactopus**](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/hAaYMrEs-leveling-and-rewards-early-impressions-and-adjustments) can put things into perspective. Over time, the system should actually be giving out *more* rewards, but this is over time not all at once.\n\nOne more thing that's being changed shortly is the First Win of the Day bonus, Cactopus mentions here....\n\n> \"Because we got some early feedback that players don't want to feel punished for being high-leveled, we're going to go ahead and tweak the leveling curve to make high-level grinding easier. In the chart below you can see the leveling curve as it exists today (represented by the blue line) as well as what it'll look like after we change the system (represented by the orange line)—this change should ship during patch 7.23.\"\n\nFeel free to hop back in and ask more questions, but if you have feedback about the new systems please submit it over there on Cactopus's post so the Devs can see and take that into account.","replies":[{"poster":"ItsMaddoga","date":"2017-11-13T22:33:02.464+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh Okay I see it helps higher level players get back in a groove.

There are a lot of 450 and 1350 champions that are fun and powerful and you can afford like ten of them for the price of a max price 6300 champ.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-14T02:08:07.381+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"Also, keep in mind that you don't actually have to \"buy\" champions from the store at all. If you have a champion shard of someone you know you want, you can use that to unlock the champ permanently by spending some BE. It won't be as much as buying them from the store since you have their shard!","replies":[]}]}]}]}
