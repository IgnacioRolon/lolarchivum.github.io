Her robes were breathtakingly beautiful, the deep near-magenta reds and intricately-detailed gold patterns were simply stunning and the violet, I can't emphasize how amazingly gorgeous the violet was.  The gentle blue into lovely gold of her hair suited her perfectly and her golden Etwahl tied it all together.  An aesthetic masterpiece.  I feel a sad pain that I don't get to see it anymore, not just because Sona is now unplayable, but also because it's just not there anymore.\n\nDon't get me wrong, the new version looks okay in its own right, but it's comparably a weak knock-off.  The colors of her robes are a bit bright and the magical violet is completely lost.  Her hair has become a dull pastel and somehow looks greenish, like they lazily added yellow on top of the blue.  The Etwahl looks like a yellow plastic children's toy.  I wish they would've put half the effort into her character models as they wasted on visual FX just so she looks like she's doing something, even though she's not.  So I guess I just don't care anymore, I guess I'll just say something slutty like Kitty Kat or Bunny Riv.  Blood Moon Akali looks nice too.\n\nAs for splash-arts, that's not as clear.  There are a lot of nice ones, but no singular one that stands out like the old Silent Night used to for in-game.  Dryad Soraka is lovely, I'm partial to Pool Party Leona and Chinese Pharaoh Nidalee is very nice too.  The actual list is a lot longer and those might not even be my top three.  I guess that goes to show they have multiple talented artists working on them and each one shows off their unique style.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheProAndrew","date":"2014-08-13T07:15:27.462+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"metal gear yasuo","replies":[]}]}
