And you can't simply give the excuse to buy new runes since they are costly for many players. Either the lethality of runes will have to be significantly buffed or the early armor of jungle creeps will have to be nerfed.","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2016-10-19T18:35:14.827+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"We'll be tuning both individual champs and jungle camps as needed to account for larger systemic changes like this.","replies":[{"poster":"Shadow Hazard","date":"2016-10-19T19:56:11.381+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thats good to hear. Similar related note on junglers effected by the mastery change why not give warelords spellvamp also andthe ability to work on jungle monsters also or even look at doing a full keystone pass in a way that it can be effective on junglers also. Fervor, grasp, and DFG could be modified to work in the jungle but with reduced effectiveness against monsters. I think this could be the best change that would be a benefit to all the junglers without needing to tune anything else from the changes to smite buff removal + APen change + SoTA removal\n\nOn a non related note, I hope the team considers more ways to make sure you have a proper difference on more AD  vs more APen/lethality idea in a similar way that you are doing with the updated duskblade by giving unique effects scaling off of lethality.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sonic√êeHedgedawg","date":"2016-10-19T19:45:48.654+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Does lethality have an effect on minions and monsters?
