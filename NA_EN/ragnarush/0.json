I understand this is all going to probably fall by the wayside, but I&#039;m saying it regardless because if people do not talk about possible issues, they will never get fixed. My problem Riven is that she seems to be a champ who has just too many different traits in her kit. While most champions are a fun bundle of mixed traits  that vary based on their damage, range, forms of crowd control, move speed, dashes, shields, heals and etc, Riven owns far more of these traits than the average champion. To be specific, she has: four dashes, a shield that scales on attack damage, an area of effect stun, an area of effect knock up, high damage (approximately 600 ad during the late game phase if built correctly and using abilities), the ability to have extremely low cool-downs on her skills, and a decently ranged ultimate. On top of all that, its also possible to basically cheat the game by using certain techniques to cancel out her skill animations, causing her to cast abilities without them being telegraphed that makes it harder for even skilled players to react in time and appropriately. Personally, I feel like this should be grossly unacceptable for Riot to let a champion that has so much power behind them to roam around for players to abuse. It just seems extremely unfair. I understand the claim that Riven is just a &quot;skill based champion,&quot; but I do not find that a champion that can be glitched to show no telegraphs for abilities should be considered &quot;skillful.&quot; that is simply abusing an exploit and using a cheap excuse to Riven overpowered. I just hope that someone in the Riot team that helps manages champion balances is able to read this and, at the very least, take this plea to fix Riven into consideration.","replies":[]}
