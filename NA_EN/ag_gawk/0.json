I can type in the chat when i have the glitch i just can't use abilities. In order to fix it i have to completely log out of league, log back in and rejoin the game. Sometimes the people in the game have already remade it so i get leaver buster over this. Does anyone know how to fix it?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-12-07T23:55:35.458+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There might be some corruption with your settings that's failing to respond to your inputs.
