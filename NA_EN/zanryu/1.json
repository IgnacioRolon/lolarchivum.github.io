However only Shyvana's basic attacks are affected by this debuff. Can be include Shyvana's name into the tooltip to add the Clarity to this. Otherwise people, me included, would think that allied basic attacks will also deal the bonus damage.\r\n\r\nZanryu","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2014-09-01T01:07:26.730+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good catch, we'll fix that.","replies":[{"poster":"Tortferngatr","date":"2014-09-02T22:07:57.544+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Good catch, we'll fix that.\n\nHmm.
