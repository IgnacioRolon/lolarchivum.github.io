His father provided him the very best teachers who have trained him for years so he could achieve perfect practice in swordsmanship. At the age of 14 he joined the Blue Lotus Order. It's main goal was to help the people most in need and protect the citizens from dangers that could wait for them during their travel. Two years later, when Noxus forces invaded Ionia, the members of the Order came all the way along to help Ionians defend their land. All of them died except for Alen nad his master, Alrond. They both decided to fulfill the will of fallen friends and the Order founder and find the legendary Blade of Blue Lotus named Neela. After weeks of searching, they finally made it to the place it was hidden. They gained the sword but soon ancient guardians appeared and Alrond died, buying time for Alen to escape. After that he made a choice to continue the life he lived until now, using his two swords to help the people living on the land stained with his friends' blood that was soon to become his new home.\n\n\n**ALEN\nTHE BLUE LOTUS SWORDSMAN**\n\n\t\t                                            **Stats** \nHealth:\t              542–2020\t\t                 Attack Damage:\t      68–124.1\nHealth Regen.:     8–18.5                                       Attack Speed:\t      0.67  (+ 0 – 53.6%)\nMana:                   410–1140                                  Armor:\t                      34–92.6\nMana Regen.:      10.5–22.5                                  Magic Resistance:     32.1–53.4\nRange:\t              150\t\t                                 Movement Speed:     345\n\n\n**PASSIVE – COMBINED BLADES ART**\nAuto attacks variably deals magical and physical damage to enemies.\nEvery 5 auto attacks Alen performs double cut dealing both magical and physical damage.\n\n**Q – HORIZONTAL LEAP**\n**COOLDOWN:** 14/12/10/8/6\n**COST:** 50/55/60/65/70 MANA\n**TARGET RANGE:** 500\n\n**ACTIVE:** Alen dashes in the target direction then stabs an enemy if one is present in the range \nof auto attack.

And again - sorry that it is in anime style but it is the easiest style for draw to me. And unfortunealy i don't know how to make a 3D model, so i won't xd\nhttps://ibb.co/8m3t2M1\n\nIt's the first time i try to make something as complex as this, so well... idk if it looks good xD Let me know what you think anyway :P","replies":[{"poster":"Mr Voidling","date":"2019-05-10T22:56:55.918+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Outside of disliking any spelling aside from \"Allen\" (Alen, Alan, Allan, Allin), he seems pretty linear in his gameplay.\nPassive makes it so enemies need to build Health in order to counter your damage, as Armor or Magic resist leaves the other damage type open, which isn't too bad.\nHis Q is basically Fiora Q copied to a T. Just insanely longer range.\nW is very strange in the way you say it works. Basically if it HITS an enemy you have to wait 4 seconds to recast it? At max rank with 45% CDR it has a cooldown of 2.2 seconds, so hitting an enemy... makes it have a longer cooldown? Or is it supposed to be within 4 seconds instead of after?\nE is just a buff to his other skills, and a passive shield.\nR is his only interesting skill.\nHe also has insane movement speed, paired with incredibly high base AD, so early game he would be pretty powerful...","replies":[{"poster":"Kokos337","date":"2019-05-10T23:26:08.499+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It was supposed to work like Aatrox's Q but with 2 strikes with 4 seconds delay between them (with no modificators) and if u hit both then you have reduced cooldown. But as i look at it right now, it doesn't make much sense so I think I will change it? And btw i don't think it has insane movement speed, Fiora's movement speed is 345 and Alen's is 350 for comparison","replies":[{"poster":"Mr Voidling","date":"2019-05-11T00:45:03.927+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well that's 5 more with a +100 on the Q, so the stick potential is pretty high. Only thing that stops is the fact he can't block CC. CC in general might shut him down pretty hard.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-05-10T22:57:42.628+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Full name: Tihm Alen\nMotto: \"MORE POWER! _grunts_\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mavëríck","date":"2019-05-10T22:42:53.591+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"8/10 would play","replies":[{"poster":"Kokos337","date":"2019-05-10T22:50:19.739+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks :D","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TheKiller5510","date":"2019-05-11T22:04:05.570+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So his ratios are like pre-rework sion?","replies":[{"poster":"Kokos337","date":"2019-05-11T22:27:22.312+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Idk about his pre-work ratios so I can't answer lol","replies":[{"poster":"TheKiller5510","date":"2019-05-12T14:57:28.503+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i meant that 2 abilities were ap and 2 ad :P","replies":[{"poster":"Kokos337","date":"2019-05-12T18:12:47.883+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh, ok.
