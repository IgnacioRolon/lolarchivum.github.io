I will helpfully clear things up for you.\r\n\r\nYou seem to be under the impression that League is like just hanging out with just your friends in real life and you get to act as stupid and crass as you are with them.\r\n\r\nIf you want to play only with your friends in custom games where you get to act all you want like that, then feel free to use league for that.\r\n\r\nHowever, when you queue up with anyone that is not your friends, your behavior needs to adjust for this. If you go into a restaurant, start throwing slurs, behaving derogatory and acting in a hostile way you are ruining everyone else's experience in the restaurant. You will also get promptly kicked out for behaving in such a manner.\r\n\r\nWhen you queue up for ranked, it takes it even a step further. As you are no longer playing a casual game and are playing a competitive game. A proper example is going to work for a professional business. Your actions are held to an even higher standard and more is expected out of you while you hold a professional attitude. \r\n\r\nNow it is unreasonable that you are expected to excel immediately when you enter into the world. It takes time to grow and adjust as you move along. Just like it is unreasonable for you to hold others to that standard when they first enter. But most professional businesses will give you plenty of slack, especially in the beginning as long as you hold a positive attitude. Of course, the more time spent with no improvement whatsoever will lessen that slack. But many places will rather keep a worker with a good work ethic and attitude than a skilled one with nasty behavior.\r\n\r\nBut many have a zero tolerance for work place hostility, sexual harassment, harassment, and equal opportunity violations and even the slightest discretion will get you in trouble, possibly suspended, or even just fired.\r\n\r\nIf you are able to understand things like these and enact it, you will not only see less to no punishment but you will find the game to be more enjoyable because the nasty atmosphere that followed you around due to your creation will have disappeared.","replies":[]}
