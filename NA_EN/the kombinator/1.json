Now what stirs someone up is extremely subjective. What if i'm stirred up from stuff, that says, that Pyke is OP, or should be nerfed, because i like it. Should i report every thread about those?\n\nWe will see, if the mods. can give an answer, that change the can't apply on everything part.

I could certainly be wrong (as can sometimes be the case with broad-strokes rules), but I'm fairly confident in my reading of it.\n\n> Also \"posts specifically made to stir up\". Now what stirs someone up is extremely subjective. What if i'm stirred up from stuff, that says, that Pyke is OP, or should be nerfed, because i like it. Should i report every thread about those?\n\nWhat I mean is posts obviously designed to cause strife. Like saying \"People who like [insert subject here] are wrong and should feel bad\", etc. - posts written specifically to get any group of people agitated and jumping to defend whatever it is you're agitating them about.\n\nIf someone's calling for Pyke nerfs, you can report them, but if they're not otherwise breaking the rules, it's not going to matter. Calling for nerfs or pointing out that a Champion is overpowered isn't against the rules, as long as there's a reasonable degree of effort put into the post.\n\n> We will see, if the mods. can give an answer, that change the can't apply on everything part. Right now your explanation still makes it applicable on everything.\n\nWhen you try to be as extremely literal as you can about it, sure. But you're just not looking through the right lens.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-09-04T23:14:57.558+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Semantics dont tend to hold up well unless it is in federal court.","replies":[{"poster":"The Kombinator","date":"2019-09-04T23:18:36.862+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":6,"body":"Well making a rule, that conversations are against a rule on a forum which was designed for conversations is just silly.
