Not a troll build, but certainly off-meta.\n\nOr you want to learn a new role, or champ.\n\nQuestion is: Where to do it?\n\nCoop: Beside the fact, that AI does not give nearly as much challenge as players. Certain roles are not guaranteed. Especially true for jungler. One or two mach maybe so you figure out how your champion works. A few more for junglers so you can learn proper jungle cleaning.\n\nBlind pick: Chance of getting the role you want is quite low in case of popular roles. So it may, or may not work. If blind pick were role choosing style like Draft, then i would say go for it. In fact it would be even better than draft as no bans, and enemy can't pick your champion either.\n\nDraft pick: This is what remains. Unless your role is not popular. Like Support for some reason. At least i get that like 99,9% of my games as main.\n\nRanked: If you don't know why you shouldn't do such here, then either learn about the game first, or get some common sense. In short. Ranked is for the win.\n\nIf Blind pick had role selection, then we could say, that Draft is about the final preparation for ranked. And not trying out stuff, or learning game mode.","replies":[{"poster":"True Garen","date":"2019-09-09T00:02:12.231+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not only should blind pick NOT have role selection, but just because a played selected a champion, should NOT prevent another player from selecting the same champion...","replies":[{"poster":"The Kombinator","date":"2019-09-09T07:15:10.727+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=True Garen,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=ZbepEF2W,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2019-09-09T00:02:12.231+0000)\n>\n> Not only should blind pick NOT have role selection, but just because a played selected a champion, should NOT prevent another player from selecting the same champion...\n\nStill no role guarantee.

So no 5 adc style. Though that would be a new reason for flame. \"damn matchmaking made an impossible team again\" It would be partly a role selection too. When you choose a champion you would hidden choose a number of roles that champion can go. For example Soraka would be support only, but Vayne would be bot/top. Yasuo would be any except jungler.","replies":[]}]}]}
