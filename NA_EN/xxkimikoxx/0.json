I noticed when I installed the game it crashed my wifi connection. Now my wifi keeps cutting out and then reconnecting anywhere between 1 minute to 3 minutes at time. The game is is not even open on my computer right now. I unchecked peer to peer review, restarted my computer and my modem but it's still cutting out. I know it's not my laptop because my cellphone is also losing its connection. Everything was fine until I installed the game is anyone else having this problem?","replies":[{"poster":"Whirly","date":"2017-02-21T15:39:16.410+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Having the same problem","replies":[]},{"poster":"Commander Doug","date":"2017-02-21T02:59:37.777+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am having the same problem. keeps freezing my internet.

I strongly recommend reaching out to your ISP's technical support team so they can assist you with troubleshooting your equipment.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DVVN","date":"2017-02-19T22:42:16.721+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Its your problem. Riot doesn't give a fuck about latency issues. They always say it is something on their end. Yet the only application that ever lags is their shitty fucking game that they get away with running out of shitty servers, because profit margin.","replies":[]}]}
