I have treated the game like you would any other hobby, casually and with friends. I have one chat restriction on my account record, but that was because I was repeating what someone was saying to me in an ironic way LiKE tHIs (insert spongebob meme here), and may have repeated him calling me the R-word. Way to go, Cody.\r\n\r\nNow as for the ban on my account, it was stated to me in my report  that I was banned for using third party programs, though I have never downloaded anything to affect my gameplay in the entire four years I have been playing. The last game I played on my account was the Urf Warwick game, where I went 13/9/7. As you'll notice from my match history, there are three ARAM games after that one. I did not play these games\r\n\r\nI have never given out my LoL password to anyone. \r\n\r\nI believe that I may have been hacked, and this would make sense, seeing as how the games are ARAM games and that gamemode is used a lot with bots and what not for leveling accounts (even though my account is level 192ish). I am unsure as to what happened, but would gladly like some advice from anyone in the community if they have any. I have spent roughly $3,000 on this account, and really don't want to lose it over something like this. I have already thrown in a support ticket to Riot and am waiting on a response from them hopefully sometime soon. {{summoner:50}}","replies":[{"poster":"FancyBirdNA","date":"2019-11-01T06:49:26.281+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"My account has been saved! thank you all so much","replies":[]},{"poster":"Aliquid","date":"2019-11-01T05:20:36.124+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"All you can do is wait sadly!
