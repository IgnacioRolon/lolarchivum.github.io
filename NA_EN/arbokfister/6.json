Normal or Ranked are meaningless terms out of the videogame. A videogame is something we play just for fun, but it is something absolutely non important in terms of life. The fact that we have learned to consider that some mode of game that gives you certain kind of points as \"more important\" than others is something artificial.\nAt the end it is just another game mode of a videogame.

If you want to have a full picture, that's up to you. I am not judging the OP nor what he did because I have no evidence. And I don't really care. We are here seeing a series of incredibly offensive comments made by someone. I'm sorry if I don't give a shit about what other players might have said first. If they said things just as bad as that, then they'll have to be punished as well.\nDemagogy. Pure and simple. Comparing saving a city with online harassment of a guy who said to others to kill themselves and a sequence of slurs.\n\"But maybe he was saving the world! You don't know that!\"\nThat's your comment. And that's demagogy. \nFor the purposes of this community and this game, I don't care about the personal circumstances of the person that put those messages. That's not up for Riot to solve. Not for us. What we can do, is to keep that people away from this game. Don't bring your demagogy trying to compare a depressed person enjoying a game with an online harasser trying to make life miserable for others in a game. \nNo, the second one lost the right to enjoy the game. And that is not hypocrisy. That is just fair. \n\nStop defending this behavior. Stop saying \"but what if.\" Stop pretending that there could be things we are missing from our limited perspective of the issue. \nNobody killed anybody in self defense because their life was threatened and could only use the last resource of lethal force. \nNo. There was a series of unacceptable comments.

In fact, he is actively creating a hostile environment for his team. I would be surprised to find someone who would find this behavior acceptable or tolerable.

Lets address this issue and start taking step to eradicate these online harassers from places like this one.","replies":[{"poster":"WhiteGuyWannaBe","date":"2015-05-19T06:19:34.634+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is possible you are reading more into my reply then is actually there or it is possible you just have a unrealistic view of the world in general.  I am certainly for taking measures to improve safety for all users under all circumstances (providing there is some regard for individual freedom) but unless people enjoy being victimized they should either avoid the risky circumstances or better prepare themselves for such encounters.  They also owe it to others to raise awareness of the situation and everyone else should work to improve the situation, but if something poses a significant threat, the first logical step is to isolate one from the threat.\n\nAs for the assertions that similar behavior is found everywhere on the internet, there is certainly some truth to that, but League and other massively popular games tend to be cesspools of sociopathic behavior, far worse then most other games or sites.  If someone actually has a mental condition which would make it risky for them to play league there is an incredible array of other option for them to use until said problems are dealt with, if that ever happens.  \n\nSorry for not responding sooner, but I've been quite busy lately, I would love to discuss this further as this disagreement seems to be largely related to personal responsibility and agency vs what might be termed social responsibility, but unfortunately I will be away from the internet for the next few months.  Feel free to respond for the benefit of any other readers, but by the time I get back this thread is going to be long since buried.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"NeoJusteBelmont","date":"2015-05-17T02:39:14.484+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=OkamotoSenpai,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=nGtAmz6P,comment-id=0009000000000000,timestamp=2015-05-16T23:56:12.094+0000)\n>\n> I am 34 and been on the internet since the first dial ups came out.

I think Riot needs to plant this to the players' mind: If they are not capable of acting decent, then they are lower than trash and deserves to be humiliated like hell. Don't just give penalties like bans or such, but instead let them play... and let everyone else knows that this guy is toxic and a laughing stock, like putting a 'kick me' sign on their butt. Allies or enemies do so. Just make their playing experience HORRIBLE. That is the kind of punishment I think would hit right on spot....\n\nAnd yeah, I prefer to play with feeders than toxic people.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Sythriel Draken","date":"2015-05-16T23:09:17.727+0000","up_votes":21,"down_votes":2,"body":"What's worse is Riot won't do anything to this guy...","replies":[{"poster":"Chromatic Eagle","date":"2015-05-17T18:39:57.635+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You sure?

Didn't even bother with stacking his Q.\n\nSo even though I had just ganked for him and both mid and bot needed help (cause every lane always needs loads of help in this ridiculous silver ELO), he then spam pinged on top of me and said I HAD to gank for him again.  I calmly explained to him that all he had to do was farm and build MR and that I had to gank the other lanes.  Bot lane was after all already flaming me as well, cause welcome to silver\n\n\"Just getting your second buff and recalling after a successful gank top side?  YOU SHOULD HAVE GANKED BOT TWICE ALREADY! HERPY DERPA DERP!\"\n\nAnyway, instead of doing the normal thing and playing safe, warding, and waiting for me to make the rounds of winning every single lane for my team on my own, he then says the typical \"if you don't gank in 2 mins I'm afk feeding at 20.\"  My Zed was luckily the only other mature one on the team and tried to back me up, but by doing so Nasus flamed him for a bit as well until Zed gave up and muted the kid.  So, I go to gank bot and we get one kill and then a dragon, Zed even managed to force the enemy Talon off the tower so we head mid to force it down quickly.  Meanwhile top Nasus over extends chasing Vlad past the minion waves for no reason and Olaf shoes up, then instead of flashing out and running from the lvl 5 Olaf he tries to 1v2 them since he was lvl 6.  He dies and preceeds to rage up a storm like I have not seen in a very long time, all directed at me personally and how I'm an awful jungler and he was for sure just going to troll and feed now, all cause I wasn't there for the counter gank... and got a kill, dragon, and tower with my team instead....\n\nHe then continued to do this for a few more minutes, just none stop harassing, it was so bad bot lane even shut up and stopped harassing me, cause I was doing perfectly fine and they didn't have much reason too anymore and Nasus was dong so anyway.  I then muted him, told him I would, and I guess after finally realizing I wasn't just saying it he started to feed on purpose cause \"my jungler was completely useless!\"  As he put in the end game chat.\n\nSo I feel your pain, and only the enemy Vlad stuck around to report him with me, even my own team all left instantaneously, so I doubt that childish Nasus will get enough reports to warrant a look, at least not that match, so for now he's prob going to get away with it.\n\nPeople are just generally pathetic, and for some reason this game brings out the most pathetic side a person can muster.  No idea why, but it's all too common and not nearly punished enough.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Maratsune","date":"2015-05-17T05:11:55.700+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Ugh.
