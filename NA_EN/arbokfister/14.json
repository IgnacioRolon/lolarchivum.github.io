The only thing I wish that they would do to Yasuo is give him 320 movement speed and allow his passive to give him bonus MS like it did at release. \n\nBesides, Yasuo is pretty balanced compared to other mana-less champions. His attacks aren't crazy and his late game is usually his best. \n\nThe only thing I'm unhappy about is that Udyr has no compensation for all his close range.

Not being good enough to see those matchups, and not watching LCS means this is somewhat speculation.

Black Cleaver, Last Whisper, and Manamune being your only hard damage items, allows you to build an Iceborn Gauntlet, Banshee's Veil, and whichever boots you please in order to be nearly as tanky as the tanks on the enemy team, while shredding their tankiness, and reducing everyone's damage. If you need sustain, you can swap Manamune for an Essence Reaver, and Last Whisper for a BT. Or you can buy a Gunblade instead of Last Whisper,and keep the rest. Also, since all his damage is physical, it will all proc the Elixer of Wrath's damage return, which helps tremendously.\n\nThe only thing I think that really hard-counters him is silences, and hard engage CC comps. You can soft counter him with anything if you play it right, but the hard counters are the only thing I see in my low ELO on a regular basis.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
