But in all seriousness, I was chat banned for 8 games back in March. I know this was a long time ago but it&#039;s still relevant since there isn&#039;t a Tribunal still.  I haven&#039;t had any ban on my account in a long ass time. I even got the free skin for being a good member of the community last year around Christmas (Nunubot).  I can&#039;t even remember even getting any of those pop ups that happen after the game saying you were reported for X behavior.\r\n\r\nI tried to get to the bottom of it by submitting a ticket and what follows are the emails back and forth.  My first email to them was on March 11th and the last one I received from Riot regarding my inquiry was on April 9th. Talk about an expedient process. \r\n\r\nAll I wanted was to find out what on earth I did to receive a ban.  What I got can be summed up with, &quot;You were toxic. Don&#039;t be toxic&quot;  Brilliant.  \r\n\r\nTheir response when I asked what I did wrong so I can correct my behavior (The first email for the second jpg)  actually pissed me off a little because it came off as &quot;too bad, deal with it, move along now&quot; when I nicely asked what I did wrong so I can fix my mistakes.  \r\n\r\nThe entire process is fairly frustrating because they handed out a punishment and told me to stop being toxic but they didn&#039;t explain really how I was being toxic, wouldn&#039;t give me chat logs to show me the context of my toxic behavior, wouldn&#039;t tell me the kind of reports I got and almost took an entire month to get what little info I could out of them.  \r\n\r\nA+ Riot A+","replies":[{"poster":"NemeBro","date":"2015-06-14T20:36:25.184+0000","up_votes":22,"down_votes":1,"body":"Why are you calling people sluts in-game?","replies":[{"poster":"arbokfister","date":"2015-06-14T20:42:36.249+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":14,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=NemeBro,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=EzcNiVVc,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2015-06-14T20:36:25.184+0000)\n>\n> Why are you calling people sluts in-game?\n\nIt doesn't matter what I say if they don't provide the chat logs to show the context of what I'm saying","replies":[{"poster":"Ghiefelstein","date":"2015-06-14T21:15:48.492+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":2,"body":"Words like 'slut' and 'a fucking jugalo' will almost be interpreted negatively by other players, no matter the context.
