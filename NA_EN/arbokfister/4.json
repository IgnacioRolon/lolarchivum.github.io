The game isn't just the laning phase. If you have a poor matchup, just acknowledge the loss and make plans accordingly.\n\nFor example, I had a lvl 28 friend playing maokai top against a lvl 30 kalista. He was doomed from the start. But because he listened to my advice, he turned a guaranteed loss lane into a victory for the team. I told him he **will** lose his lane. I told him to simply accept that fact and focus on damage control. Focus on farming as much as he could safely acquire and build armor. He lost his tower early (between 8 and 15 min) but once he got a warden's mail and a catalyst,  he could actually 1v1 the kalista. \n\nDamage control is an important skill that not a lot of players bother to learn properly. I've seen far too many ppl focus on winning lane to the detriment of the team. Being 20-40 cs below your lane opponent at 20 mins does not mean you insta lose the game. But being 0/5 with 40 less cs is a death sentence to your team.\n\nBut with the recent surge of mobility focus riot's been giving us; everyone is focused on \"out playing\" their lane opponent and trying to \"win\" lane instead of focusing on farm and securing objectives.\n\nI can't tell you how painful it is for me to be mid lane happily out farming my lane opponent by 12 cs only to hear \"an ally has been slain\" coming from the bot lane every 1-2 mins or so.

There is also the Diffusal Blade, which removes debuffs from your hero.\n\nLeague went a different route.  For most champions, Tenacity is the only CC reduction they will ever get.  In high level or organized team play, the support might buy Mikael's if they have the money and the team needs it.  And there is Banshee's, which blocks one spell no matter what it does.\n\nThey are different games with different methods.  What DotA does not have, however, is a special form of CC that is impervious to all defenses and actions.  And you can't even say the counterplay to knock-ups is not to get hit, because they aren't all skillshots.  If they were restricted to being skillshots, that would be a reasonable justification for making them uncounterable once you got hit.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"manbearswine","date":"2015-03-05T13:33:36.375+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=LeeDark,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=EpV60VQr,comment-id=0006,timestamp=2015-03-05T05:44:17.934+0000)\n>\n> Because mobility inherently has counterplay!
