Maybe calculate our damage, give us the gold in game if we deal 50% damage or greater. RG's server should record our total damage to towers, and +1 our \"towers destroyed\" counter once we achieve an equivalent/total damage of one tower's full health. Example: if a tower has 100 hp, and we dealt 50 or more damage to that tower, then we get the gold for that tower [tower must be destroyed within \"n\" seconds to claim gold]. Let's assume we get 250 hp in tower damage total for that game. This should translate to +2 towers destroyed for that game. If we play another game, and claim another 250 hp in tower damage, then by the end of that game, we should have a +5 towers destroyed. This would be a fair way of balancing the rules regarding towers destroyed, imho.","replies":[]}]}
