But when she does use her q on you be immediately ready to shunpu either her directly if she is max range or a minion opposite side of where she will jump to. She will usually press Q then try and W.

That said, Morde vs. LeBlanc, assuming equal skill, is a pretty bland lane.

If you can keep behind minion waves, it becomes much harder for her to harass you.  Casting your shield on a minion for maximum shield gen, and then spamming E and Q, makes sure that you stay at full shield as much as possible.  If you leave yourself open, she will snare and burst you.  It also depends on how fast Morde gets his {{item:3145}}, at which point his laning becomes much easier.","replies":[{"poster":"Raid Boss Morde","date":"2015-04-30T01:26:37.243+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can't rely on spamming E in lane though, at least since his Health regen nerfs.

I prefer starting spellthief on Soraka as it allows me to get 1 health and 2 mana pots + gold for poking (as a small compensation for lack of farm) and mana regen. \n\nAnyway, anything can work if you will hug tower and dont let her kill you but the problem is that is shes not stupid she will roam -> you cant follow her, she will oneshot you in any bush, you cant push -> she will oneshot you once she go back. And she will take kills on other lanes.

Diana looks as best pick overally, LB cant oneshot her, while Diana can oneshot her, push better and can roam as well as her. Heimer will be pushing all the time and she wont be able to kill him solo, ganks are usually at least 1 kill for Heimer and when he get Zhonya its hard to gank him at all.
