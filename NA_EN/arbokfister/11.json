Just legitimate inquiry.\r\n\r\nI often see heavy people dating other heavy people and I wonder why that is. Are they actually sexually attracted to them or is it because they don't think they could get a skinnier gf/bf? Is physical appearance not as important to them because they aren't as attractive themselves? I get that personality is more important than appearance but you have to be, at least on some level, attracted to someone to date them.\r\n\r\nWhat's the deal, gd?","replies":[]}
