Vel'koz actually does quite well against assassins up until they reach the point where they can 100-0 him before he has a chance to retaliate.  Talon reaches this point faster than any other assassin and I've always considered him the hardest matchup as well. In contrast, champions like Zed, Akali, and Yasuo don't reach their 100-0 potential until far, far later in the game, and you should have a Zhonyas by that point. Akali in particular is an extremely easy matchup for Vel'koz, even before they nerfed her.
