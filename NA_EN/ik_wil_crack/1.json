Since all actions displayed in the match are interpreted from data inside the packets you and the other players send to the server, if there are losses or delays in these packets hitting your PC, it can cause delays in what you see. I suggest taking a look at our [connection guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) for a list of steps that should resolve this.\n\nLet me know if these issues persist.","replies":[]}]}
