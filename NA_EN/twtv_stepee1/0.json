My ping suddenly spikes from 32 to 39-50 and my champion gets stuck on the screen for a few seconds this happens 4 to 5 times in the entire game. The weird thing is i can see everything else working just fine as in other players fighting and there is no real lag where everything is moving slowly or something its just that my champion gets stuck and can't use any abilities. I would highly appreciate some help on this matter.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-02T22:43:44.022+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmmm it almost sounds like you might be dealing with some packet loss troubles.
