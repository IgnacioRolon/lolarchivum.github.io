(General ping issues as well) (Everything is breaking aaahhh)","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've recently been having issues with my ping, where it would rise into the thousands about 5-10 minutes in, and then stay there. I've found that connecting using Windscribe VPN fixes the ping issue. However, I'm using the free version of Windscribe and wanted to switch to a vpn w/o a data limit, so I connected to an OpenVPN server from [VpnBook](https://www.vpnbook.com/freevpn). I can connect to other websites perfectly fine, but not to the login servers.\n\nNow, I've been unable to login entirely unless I'm using Windscribe.\n\nI have no idea what's going on, or whether any of these issues are connected.\n\nPlease help\n\n\n\nAs a side note, I do not have access to the router's admin interface. \n\n\nEdit: Grrr ok so I found [this](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664#wq9) saying that I shouldn't be using a vpn to connect. However, there was also [this](http://forums.euw.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=1184088) post describing how to connect using a pptp vpn. Alas, the firewall blocks my attempt to connect to pptp servers, and I don't know how to circumvent that.","replies":[{"poster":"BayesianBacon","date":"2017-10-10T01:41:23.744+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok imma wait a day and see if this was a problem on riot's side, what w/ that post that just went up about login issues and all","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-10T03:19:37.359+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeeeep we were indeed having some slight login issues a bit earlier on. Let me know if you're able to get signed in now or not!\n\nWe also had some weird issue with the error messages being confused. Some players were getting a connection error when it was actually an incorrect password. Go ahead and hit up our account agents to make sure your password is still working and hasn't been changed.","replies":[]}]}]}
