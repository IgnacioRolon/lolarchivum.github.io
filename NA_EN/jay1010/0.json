I am able to accept and choose the champion I desire, but when the game loads, it is stuck on 0% and my whole computer freezes which causes me to restart my PC. This happens randomly. Sometimes, I am able to play the game but sometimes when I try to play another one right after, the game would freeze. This has caused me a 20 minute ban 2 times already and I am getting tired of it. Any solutions? Please help.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-20T17:00:13.495+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you on Windows 10?  This could be caused by the [Xbox Game Bar](http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8637-game-bar-turn-off-windows-10-a.html) which has been known to cause freezing like this, but disabling it could help.  Otherwise, run through the steps in our [game crash](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes+) guide as a driver or hardware problem could also be the culprit here.","replies":[]}]}
