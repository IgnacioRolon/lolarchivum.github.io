I&#039;m going to try and break this down into 3 parts as the title suggests. First I want to discuss the pros then what I consider to be negatives and lastly what is just inherently toxic about it and needs to just be outright changed for DQ and ranked in general.\n\nDQ the good.\n\n1. It bought the new draft system which is Team builder lite. Yes you dont always get the primary role and fill is usually support but thats actually a reflection of the player base and not the system. I&#039;ll explain that in the broken section.\n\n2. I actually get to focus on the game with DQ. I don&#039;t have to come in there ready to be the only and primary carry and only I will be what wins us this game because in theory I picked at least some of my team mates.\n\n3. I have to worry about trolls less. The theory that we get equal amounts of trolls over time is absurd ultimately. Only because at the end of the day you dont get a troll shield after playing with one. I&#039;ve gone weeks with no trolls in my games and then had a troll every game in a day. Its truly random. It&#039;s not like pooping where someone might not poop today and so the body compensates the next day.\n\n4. I get to know that my team has a way decreased AFK rate. I picked theser people and I&#039;m not going to pick people who AFK often if ever because well, that&#039;s dumb AF.\n\n5. There is already team synergy built and that means there should be less tilting and arguing if one teamfight or trade goes wrong. And usually if the person dies for you its easier to immediately know they were trying to make sure you lived.\n\n6. League is technically a team game so I feel that the players who can actually win a lot with a consistent team are just people that are probably good players and were held back slightly by the randomness of the solo queue before.\n\n7. It gets rid of the &quot;I&#039;m better than my elo complex.&quot; Some of you might argue this one but the reality is if you are really good and feel like your teams are hurting you and hindering your climb you can at any point in your climb pull a season 4 Froggen build your own team and see how far you can actually go when the randomness is eliminated from your teams. This is a bit harder at low elo cuz smurfing can still be a thing but in general this should hold true.\n\n8. Also, you should not get banned out by your own teammates less because they know what you play and should be able to pick it for you. Also, they should be able to talk you out of doing stupid things as an extra elo shield.\n\nDQ The bad\n\n1.  Premade toxicity is real. Do I think it is at least mildly exaggerated on the boards? You bet your sweet bippy but I also pair with Elephant and Jikky a lot so we aren&#039;t running around ripping people new assholes and thus my being in a premade experience is not the random toxic premades that GD encounters. And I can think of one time I got flamed by a 4 man claiming I was feeding when I was on my fourth death and the bot lane was on their 12th on the way to 14.\n\n2. The pairing allowed is far too elastic. They first though that by just not letting gold and bronze join up. Eh Wrong. Because SV is basically B1 and when you play against a team as a band of silvers that has 2 G1/2 players an SV and some like S2 players on it the match tends to be really stompy in their favor when your whole team is mid silver and are basically guaranteed to be outperformed in 2 roles. I&#039;ve also actually had people message me even when I was s3 asking if I wanted to duo with them so they can get an easy promo series to plat.\n\n3. 4 mans&#039;s are kind of a bad thing just because it means you need to find a person thats going to fill one spot and that spot is hopefully not support seeing as bot lane should have synergy but in general it is affecting queue times. And 4 mans are the most prone to bullying which is tied in with my first DQB point.\n\n4. It seems like Riot is not making sure that premades always play against premades of the same size making sure that matches are as balanced as possible. This is also partially harmed by the really elastic matchmaking. But in general if my team just runs an Ori Jarvan comp because we know we cna get our synergy up then of course we are going to stomp on a team of five solos and thats no bueno and not really an accurate indicator of either of our skills out side of the fact that they always could have shit all over us in the lane matchups.\n\n5. Queue times can be pretty absurd whether you are solo or even 3 man at times or even duo they can be pretty crazy. And Riot can actually do something about this its just not a fun for them solution.\n\n\nRanked in general issues.\n\n1. Smurfs. Most of you are jerks. I get you want to play this game and have fun but you are legit ruining the experience for other players. It isn&#039;t we dont like a challenge. Its that we like to have a leigt shot. So when I&#039;m laning against you mid and we come out even in trades etc then we both get something out of it. You get the challenge of a player not just keeling over which should be more fun and I get to figure out how to play around an opponent more skilled than me and in general figure out how to play from slightly behind etc. However, a lot of you are duoing with people and then your duo buddy hard camps the lane which yes the point of the game is to win but thats just a dick move. You&#039;re supposed to be better than us so show it by one v five stomping us. Dont go out of your way to totally ruin someone else&#039;s play and act like its anything to be proud of. The only fix to this one is on the community though. Either we stop ruining the game for our fellow players or we dont. Even when I level my lower level account I try to be encouraging and say I&#039;m leveling an account and if you want post match advice I will give it.\n\n2. It takes too long to pay off. We have to put in work for a whole season for a border and maybe a skin. This isn&#039;t an issue completely in of itself. However, it does turn October into the gold rush and the early season into a shit storm. Ranked is most balanced in summer and then it goes to hell in fall and sucks almost all fall and Spring. If there were some kind of mile stone rewards you could get during the season it would probably smooth out the play rate and help you guys retain players and make you more money so really we all win. I put off climbing to silver last season until the end and just got it and checked out mostly because I had 3 AFK players in a row the first 3 games of my series to silver admittedly but still.\n\n3. Queue times are destroyed and Riot could fix this by doing what the second one says. Make there a reward besides just getting the border for playing ranked. More specifically make playing roles an unlockable in game feature. Whether it become flares or just icons something. Role mastery would be a nice incentive in general for people to at least play support for unlocking everything the game has to offer especially if it is ranked exclusive. It would have to take more games than champion five mastery obviously as roles are more than a couple matchups for a certain character but this would help. This also would open more mind games up with the flair for &quot;oh snap he&#039;s a rank 5  mid laner lets see if i can knock him down for spamming that flare,&quot; moments. Also something that was in team builder that you should just bring back is the ability to see what roles are needed most for ranked. Then actually offer something for the people doing it that game. Whether it be an IP boost or increased odds in the hextech key drop rate regardless reward people for being team players and the game will have a healthier dynamic.\n\n4. Solo queue MIA. This will probably be people&#039;s favorite comment. Solo queue is missing and was said to be coming. Do I think it is needed? Nope, but I think neither one truly reflects your skills as a player. I&#039;ve crushed people divisions ahead of me and lost lane to people way below. The reality is that the right mistakes can destroy your elo. Go check my lolking and look at season 3. I finished season 3 in bronze 3 but got placed in B5 and had to bust balls to climb to silver. Look at the graveyard size. IN fact here you go.  http://www.lolking.net/summoner/na/40524675#ranked-stats\n\nLook at that Tryndamere game at the bottom I earned that shit. But those were my choices. To that same token in solo Queue theres a lot of Season 3 me&#039;s still playing this game and they will tank your elo for you because &quot;eh this champs OP so I will try to play it and first time.&quot;\n\nSolo queue and DQ are almost guaranteed to have bad queue times if both come into existence. With that being said if people want to play ranked alone when they dont have all their friends I think thats fine. Granted I feel that most people just dont want to solo into double duos and four mans. Solo queue should be able to have the same rewards during the season that I mentioned earlier. Tell us what needs to be queued give IP essence whatever so that we can feel good picking a less desired role on our own end.\n\n5. Resets. These need to be less aggressive. This was already kind of rough in solo queue before but Dynamic Queue has blown this out of the water. A plat solo player can get paired with an actual team of 4 silvers and then play against a solo gold dude and some faux silvers because you reset some other plats from last season all the way down to silver and they haven&#039;t played as much ranked yet so they still look silver to your match maker and now they are holding this plat from last season back and crapping on a team of silvers just because. And the former plats earned their rank last season and while yes they should earn it back the reality is that in the meantime they are destroying the climb of others not to be spiteful like smurfs but because you aren&#039;t even giving them the choice. I doubt plats want to play with us silvers and I don&#039;t want to play against them yet at least not in ranked.\n\n6. Elasticity of parties. Time to make this tighter. You guys made high elo way stricter because of Diamond 3 players ruining master games. Well bronze 5 players ruin Silver 1 games. I mean shit, I recently duod with my friend that was silver last season and the gap between me in silver 3 to their Bronze 3 mid was actually kind of scary. Like the whole game I was just outplaying him and it was weird because he didn&#039;t deserve that. AT this point I would say the host of a ranked game should be at most able to invite someone 3 tiers above or below them and thats it. That way if  a Silver 1 wants to invite an S3/4 friend they can but the skill gap wont become so wide as it would with a bronze player on the team. Matches should actually come down to people with as close as MMR as possible with as little correction as possible by the system. People might not like that but then I think people need to have more consistent pairings and if you&#039;re good people will add you, this is especially true in low elo. People add have added me numerous times after dragging their sorry bodies across the finish line to victory. Doesn&#039;t mean I actually play with them though lol. I have found people that I enjoyed and played with for a while but the reality is DQ is probably going to sift out the real trash and bads and eventually solo queue will probably be littered with the &quot;bads&quot; of their elo because no one wants to play with them. That will happen for sure in low elo at least.\n\nI&#039;m not saying this is perfect. I&#039;m not saying no Riot shouldn't do this or that. This is just my observation of DQ and what has happened based on my own performances and experiences with the system while playing solo and in queue and these all seem like pros cons and potential fixes to queue times and in general better ranked experience. I am expecting to be downvoted for not saying I just hate DQ but I am really just hoping to have a discussion about what you disagree or agree with as issues or results based on current trends that you observe.\n\n*EDIT* for some reason points 5 and 6 are numbered one and two on the final print but not in the actual typed body.","replies":[]}
