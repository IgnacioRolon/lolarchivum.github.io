I&#039;m not proud of it. In fact the act disgusts me. The first time was a prototype but this time was different. I duo&#039;d with my friend that was silver last season and she got bronze from reset. I knew the game would be rough. So I needed something strong and that I already have experience on. With over 40K Ekko points he seemed like the logical choice. But AP jungle Ekko is broken and shorts our team a tank. So I did the horrendous act. I played Tankko. And for that, I apologize my GD brethren. I just hope you can forgive me.","replies":[]}
