A lot of people only get to play support when it is their secondary roles so I&#039;m curious if we get a big enough sample in a survey/poll if we can see what the ratio is. If we end up with roughly a 20% split across all roles then we know something is wrong but if we end up with slants in certain ones like lower ADC and support but more solo lane and jg then we might see part of the problem. I know adc seems really easy to get lately too.","replies":[]}
