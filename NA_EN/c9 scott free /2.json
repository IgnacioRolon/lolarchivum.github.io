I might still be able to play Nocturne as a carry but with how much damage I was eating as Kha and the extra delay on getting spikes off of cd I don't have the sustain to clear the jungle. You won. If I get some lucky matchups I may still play him in mid. I don't play this game to rage. I want to have fun. Jungling as kha was fun. It isn't anymore it is just a really depressing early game where you are almost dead the entire time and need leashes but you guys said you were planning on pushing buffs back so we are pretty much screwed and all have to start red on carries etc. We get it. Be a second support again like in season 3. Season 4 was the best out of the 3 seasons I have played to be a jungler. Just saying it isn't too late.","replies":[{"poster":"bumbertyr","date":"2014-11-20T09:03:23.522+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"riot hates rengar and khazix. fact of life.","replies":[{"poster":"Feathermane","date":"2014-11-20T11:26:09.626+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Like any sane person would.

I mean the nurfs are not super big ones but small things can pile up to big problems fast. They seem to be very keen on taking things away and not giving anything in return at all. I mean at least give it the ability to heal just a tiny bit more to make up for the increased cool downs. Then again Riot is a bit narrow sighted at times and lets some things slide while other (like shyvana for example) get tons of small nurfs that add up over time. Yeeeeet adcs seem to never get hurt by the give and take rule. how odd.","replies":[{"poster":"C9 Scott Free ","date":"2014-11-20T06:56:37.348+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have noticed. Kha will still have a solid late game if he can get there. They should have increased the gold of jungle camps or at least not raised their damage so much.

Granted sustain and tank junglers were hurt the least but you can still jungle carry junglers like kha'zix and rengar. I believe nightblue set rengar as a high tier jungler during his stream.\nThat said you need to gank more and rely less on farming and your start route is most likely either:\n1. golems (strong leash) - red - chickens then backing and straight to blue\n2. Golems (strong leash) - red - blue and then back to heal.\nAfter this you have upgraded your jungle item for the AoE smite and you should be fine.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Podge","date":"2014-11-20T07:30:48.154+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Key term there is \"if he can get there.\"","replies":[]}]}]}]}
