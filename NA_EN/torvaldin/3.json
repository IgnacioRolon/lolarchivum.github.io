So I picked Mordekaiser. I thought, man, he'd look cool with a similar theme as Poject: Yasuo. So thats how this came about, hope you enjoy.\n\nEDIT: I felt like expanding this skin idea to more than just a splash art. This is my first time I've ever drawn something like this though, so it isn't that amazing. Regardless, I hope you like it.","replies":[{"poster":"lDontLiftIcarry","date":"2015-01-09T14:40:10.026+0000","up_votes":35,"down_votes":1,"body":"as long as its laugh is a monotone\nHue\nHue\nHue\nHue\nHue\nthat never ends.\nEven after the animation ends.\nFor the rest of the match,.\nAnd it can be heard by all players\nAnd then even after the game ends\nAnd even after you close the game\nAnd even after you turn off your computer\nAnd even after you turn off the speakers\nAnd even after you leave your room\nAnd even in your bathroom\nRight\nIn\nYour\nEar.","replies":[{"poster":"Bhudanaboy","date":"2015-01-09T20:25:54.573+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"im sad that not everyone is gunna get to read this :< 10/10 would laugh again","replies":[{"poster":"lDontLiftIcarry","date":"2015-01-10T03:45:35.617+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you, kind sir.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Electro522","date":"2015-01-09T18:39:34.625+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"So, I don't understand.
