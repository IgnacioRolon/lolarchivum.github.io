So they do care when they make a mistake, and having the internet pile on in an overblown way (because of course that's what the internet does) can make the people that work there feel like shit.  \n\nTrust me, you don't want the passionate people leaving a gaming company.

They are building their own internet to try and shave 20ms off pings, that's insane. \n\nI used to feel the same way about Blizzard, but I just don't see that anymore.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Prozzak","date":"2016-04-02T15:45:46.268+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":2,"body":"They didn't fuck up.
