So your client forced an update on me at about 1:47am or so. This is usually fine, but not mid-game fam. My client crashed mid-normal game, and all I had open was gmail on firefox. League black screened but did play sounds properly as if I was still in game. Even though I tried to alt-f4 out, I could not, and pressing escape repeatedly did seem to work as if i was still in the game (the menu pop up sound played every second press). When I tried ctrl-alt-del to get to task manager, I could open it, but I was still black screened. pressing the windows button showed me the appopriate start screen, and hovering over my applications still showed the window contents, except for the league client and the league in-game client. I decided to restart my computer because I couldn't actually get league to shutdown.\r\n\r\nOn restart, the league client asked for administrator privileges from command prompt, but had also warned me that it would do so. The in-game client then \"updated\" after allowing it through. I sent in a support ticket, but it seems rather odd for you to have made the mistake to send out any sort of updates pre-3am. I feel like this was a hack that targeted me because I was playing at this hour.\r\n\r\nIs there a history of things like this happening to the client? Should I remove league and re-install it?\r\n\r\n\r\nside-note: I had a history of leaving back in season 5 - early 6, this is like the second game since October 2016 I've been disconnected or left from. (yeah I do believe I left a game around 3 weeks ago because I was getting flamed heavy, only time I've left a game since I moved out last october). Anyway, I got put into 5 low priority queues because of this Snafu. I know y'all don't undo automated leaverbuster decisions, but I'm pretty tilted I ended up getting shafted for a normal game I was doing well in before things went south. pls send halp.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-27T18:07:51.669+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry this is happening to you.  :(  The black screen with in-game sound usually happens with driver or hardware failure that can't render the game correctly.
