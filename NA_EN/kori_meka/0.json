For every game!","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But seriously, this has only increased in frequency as of late for me. The ironic part is that, in spite of my apparent inability to play LoL, my brother - whose computer sits a mere 20 feet away from mine - has no issues connecting at all. What can I do to somehow fix these connection issues?\n\nEDIT: I'm using NETGear while my brother uses his laptop on the WiFi, and I never AFK'd beyond League disconnecting itself. I've been stuck with 20 minute queues since then, and only because of League refusing to connect. Though other devices are connected to the router, they're not enough to cause any connection issues according to my .bat file's and Haste's respective tests.\n\nPlus, I should have added this to the original posting: the DC's are caused by an **error** that says I have been disconnected, and to try again. It gives a *retry* and a *cancel* option in the prompt, but regardless of what I do by the time I reconnect the game has been remade and I'm given more queue time.","replies":[{"poster":"Son of Ornn","date":"2018-01-05T02:23:58.195+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We noticed you replied to Kokua and said you had an antivirus software scanning but did not think that it was the cause given the frequency. From experience, we can say that's a hole a LOT of players fall into. Underestimate your AV or firewall's ability to interrupt you at your own peril, especially if your brother doesn't have it on his system for instance.\n\nLet's try troubleshooting to make sure it's not the cause to start. [**Follow the steps in our guide over here**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues#wq3) if you haven't yet to ensure that isn't interfering. Test the results by opening a couple Customs and tinkering in them for a bit, and let me know if you encounter the problem again. :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kokua","date":"2018-01-03T07:05:50.675+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not for every game, it's for a small number of your following games after punishment. And it only occurs when you show a frequent pattern of leaving / disconnecting behavior.\n\nIf you're having connection issues and he isn't, then you might want to provide more information. Is his computer different than yours, or are they the same? Are either of you on wifi, or are you both hard lined? Do you have any other devices connected at the same time? Are there any downloads or virus scans going on either from your computer, his, or any other device when these disconnections occur? Do you have anything running in the background while you're playing? Are your disconnections caused by errors, bug splats, shutdowns, power loss, forced restarts, poor connection, or what?","replies":[{"poster":"Kori Meka","date":"2018-01-03T22:56:25.659+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the response, I edited the original post with most of the info you requested.\n\nAfter examining my Task Manager while connecting to the practice tool, I found that a potential cause may be an antivirus software conducting scans while I attempt to connect. However the disconnects are far too frequent and persistent for this to be the sole cause. Regardless, I will try to connect more without any virus scans running in the background to see how often the game DC's on a larger scale.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Asterfix","date":"2018-01-03T19:01:55.580+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My guess is that you're connected to the wifi and your brother has the ethernet cable.","replies":[{"poster":"Kori Meka","date":"2018-01-03T23:02:51.956+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have NETGear, and my brother is using his laptop on the WiFi.","replies":[]}]}]}
