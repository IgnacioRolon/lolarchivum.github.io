I don&#039;t even care that I win 50% of my games against him. Even when I win its NOT FUN. Hi whole kit is cancer. His passive is the most overloaded pile of shit I&#039;ve ever seen in my life. 2x CRITS??? A SHIELD???. OH and 2 knockups???? one on a dash the other on a long range tornado. A wind wall that blocks anything it touches from any direction. His 30 second ult. His 1 million dashes.\r\nHe buys literally a fucking Zeal and does assloads of damage, its disgusting.\r\n\r\nBut people make their excuses: \r\n&quot;Avoid lanes with minions hurdurr&quot; You mean lets win the game in Jungle?  Not with towers and the nexus? You mean avoid 1/3 of the map?? Skarner gets 4 spires where he&#039;s strong but a champion that&#039;s strong around lanes and minions is balanced??\r\n&quot;Use CC&quot; This applies to any champ in the game, literally no clue why people say this shit\r\n&quot;Get good and get out of your lower elo&quot; I don&#039;t have 40 hours a day to play this game like you neckbearded nerds.\r\n&quot;Just get him behind, he&#039;s useless behind&quot; And watch him stay behind for a whopping 5 minutes until he reaches his late game 2 item powerspike and punish even the slightest bit of team mis-coordination.\r\n\r\nYeah but I guess the fact that he&#039;s banned almost every single game in lower elos doesn&#039;t speak to how displeased the community is with playing with this fuck. Low elo is &gt;50% of the player base.\r\n\r\nIf any champ needs a rework it&#039;s this shit.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-05-04T21:46:32.162+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"He needs a rework badly, but it will inevitably need to make him stronger in exchange for reliability.\n\nHis issue now is he has zero window-of-opportunity/outplay potential (he 'outplays' by pressing a button, zero skill, zero timing, totally based on matchup). He is either always oppressive or always useless.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Yaśuo Main","date":"2018-05-04T21:24:36.533+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Zed genius","date":"2018-05-04T22:25:40.844+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"hey don't even try to say more on this post, when you have a champion in your name and you try and defend them in a said champion hate post you gonna get lynched by boards trust me","replies":[{"poster":"Yaśuo Main","date":"2018-05-05T01:28:11.289+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"yeah ive seen how that goes with zed posts LOL","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Zallamance","date":"2018-05-04T21:36:25.229+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Judging by your name, gonna assume you play a lot of Yasuo.
