Now I realize there are even more trolls on plat than there were in gold. In the last 4 games, I've had at least 1 player who chooses a role or champion that they have 3 or less games on. This should be considered griefing or intentional feeding. I just got chat banned and I wasn't even being verbally abusive. I did, however, vent about being tired of people trolling every other game as some people want to enjoy their experience and win. Why is it that Riot cares more about banning people for bad words (when there's an easy solution - the mute button) rather than banning those who are actrually ruining the ranked experience for players?","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-07-03T10:14:12.005+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"So... you think that just because someone chose the champion they wanted to play rather than the champion you wanted them to play, they were trolling?

It could be a playstyle choice, it could be a choice made my someone who doesn't understand situational weaknesses well enough.

It's workable, but definitively increases my chances of losing. Just like picking a champ I have little to no mastery on (pyke). I wouldn't count it as trolling, but it would be intentionally handicapping. I know it's handicapping because I have an absurd amount of experience on koz, but a medium experience player may consider it, and I think them building it shouldn't be bannable (like picking a champ with low mastery) but should be a learning experience for them when they get destroyed for it.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"overrz9000","date":"2019-07-03T17:24:36.417+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I 100% understand your pain. As someone who played two to about three years ago in high plat and finally comes back and gets placed in bronze 5 i 100% understand your pain now. Also, I main adc. I have dealt with so many people feeding, leaving, trolling, and just downright not listening to calls it makes the climb unbearable. That's why i've decided to not play anymore. Unless you play a hyper carry mid or top it's really hard to influence the game. For example, out of my last 100 games coming back, I would say about 30-40% of the games had a clear troll in them or intentional feeder. I don't mean by the end of the game someone had 10 deaths but literally by the 8-minute mark a top or mid had 5 deaths. Granted I've been climbing steadily its just the amount of games i have to play is ungodly. To reach even what I think is the average skill level of gold I'll easily have to play around 200 more games at my current ranking progress. Which mean I would basically have to live on this game and it makes it demoralizing. Also, it's tedious when you have the trolls and they just never get banned. That's just the sad state of games like this though and I'm not sure how you fix it. When it comes to someone doing unconventional builds I understand my last game had ad ekko and you can go ahead and bet he gave up 6 kills within 9 mins. lol But, there really isn't much you can do about it. BNot sure there is really anything riot can do about it either. ","replies":[{"poster":"Life Is A Toilet","date":"2019-07-08T13:39:10.297+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I hear ya man. It's awful. I seriously don't mind losing games. I just want it to be a decent game. But this season is horrible. Every game is incredibly one-sided and 90% of the time the winner is determined in the first 10 minutes of game. It's turned into a big game of ARAM.","replies":[]}]}]}
