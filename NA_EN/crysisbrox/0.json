HEAR ME OUT though. The game that got me permabanned someone from my own team had went AFK. On top of that 4v5, enemy team was absolutely trolling us basically showing off that they are winning a 4v5. It was incredibly tilting and I couldn't help but be upset. It was the third AFK in ranked that week I believe. My memory is a bit shady on it as it happened a while ago but I do remember being very upset that people can troll us for losing a 4v5. Things got out of hand but the enemy team was ALSO toxic yet i'm permabanned. I was wondering if there is a way to get the ban lifted and have my chat perma disabled as I have zero interest in the toxicity.","replies":[{"poster":"Arcade Lulu","date":"2020-01-08T20:45:10.742+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"Nope\nOn your 14 day ban reform card it CLEARLY said that the next offense would lead to a permanent suspension","replies":[{"poster":"ACriticalThinker","date":"2020-01-08T21:07:28.461+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Arcade Lulu,realm=EUNE,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=fP6tBk1Y,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2020-01-08T20:45:10.742+0000)\n>\n> Nope\n> On your 14 day ban reform card it CLEARLY said that the next offense would lead to a permanent suspension\n\nhow many 14 day bans can you get before a perma?

Are you sure? Arent our emotions a bit impulsive in nature? Perhaps starting in the subconscious? I would say its more feasible to control your actions, than emotions. Thats a very human thing. How do you just control it like that? You make it sound like it was his choice to be upset. I dont think human emotions work that way. You can still control your actions in an upset state of mind, but I dont think one can prevent themselves from feeling upset in the first place.
