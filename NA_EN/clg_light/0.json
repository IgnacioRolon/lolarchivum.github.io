So, whenever I have got a skin shard I sell them for orange essence. But I recently got a poppy skin. Since I already own the champion, the skin was activated automatically. I cannot sell that for orange essence. Is there anyway I am able to do that?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-18T21:50:38.092+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The Lollipoppy skin you got was permanent because you rerolled 3 skin shards. This is normal and worked correctly. Rerolled skin shards are automatically redeemed and added to your collection.","replies":[]}]}
