Quite better then the old one and that never had a issue with the graphics. I read a few forums and they generally said that the windows 10 game bar should be disabled as soon as I did that I tried playing a game and it worked fine during but after the game any time I try to type any where else it crashes what ever program I try to type into. Google chrome, and even when I use the search bar on my own computer to look up files. I figured maybe I would uninstall and re-install the game and maybe that would work, how ever it didn't. It actually made it worse. Now when I play a game and I type in the game it freezes my game for 3-5 seconds no matter what I do. The game now in unplayable and I would like to continue playing. If any one has any advice or can help me I would greatly appreciate it.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-12-14T19:24:43.094+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Disabling the game bar was a good step, I'm curious if it somehow came back on if you recently updated your OS.  Definitely check again!  Otherwise when you get these new crashes, are you getting any errors or is it just a total freeze?  I'm also curious if we're reading the symptoms incorrectly- run a [log reader](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743-Connection-Troubleshooting-Log-Reader) on these matches as well to see if you might be experiencing packet loss which can sometimes look like that.

I still do not know the cause. I have how ever only tried training games so I don't know if playing in a different game effects if differently. As to my processor it runs about 1.8% of it after the game and doesn't change when my browser crashes.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zaric","date":"2017-12-14T21:26:46.752+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I recently re-checked that it was all disabled and it was still. I am going to play another game and screen shot my performance of my cpu after the game and what happens when I try to type in browser.","replies":[]}]}]}
