It is very possible your post was reported and seen first and thus, moderated. If the others were not reported they might not have been seen at that exact moment and therefore would not have been removed.\n\nWe urge you if you see posts that violate the Universal Rules or sub-board rules, please report them so we can more actively see and act upon them. If you are recruiting for your Organization, the best place to do that is [here](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/organizations).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Imperial Pandaa","date":"2018-12-01T18:32:52.615+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"There should have been some explaination in the alert you got when it was deleted.\n\nBest I can suggest is yours was reported and maybe had something extra in it that others didn't.","replies":[]},{"poster":"xRadiant","date":"2018-12-01T18:24:03.783+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":7,"body":"Cmon Jikker respond as to why only my posts are being deleted?","replies":[{"poster":"Jikker","date":"2018-12-03T01:42:21.853+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't frequent Esports, but your threads were reported and as Eva stated, we are volunteers so often we deal with reported threads and comments before we start actively browsing.  We can't be everywhere at once which is why we rely on people like you to report threads that are in the wrong section or violate the rules.\n\nThe removed threads were removed simply because they were in the wrong sub-board so it's not an offense against you or your account.  Feel free to repost your recruitment threads in the correct sub-board.\n\nIf you see some other offending threads or threads that do not follow a sub-board guidelines, by all means report them under incorrect board and we'll handle it!\n\nEDIT: Did a little cleaning in Esports.

Also, they work on a **queue** of reported items. If the others have not been reported, they don't enter the queue. They cannot possibly read every single thread, so it is left to the community to notify them of improper posts.\n\nYours was likely deleted by virtue of being reported, while the others may have not been. It is also entirely possible that yours was first in the moderation queue, and the others simply have not been addressed yet.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"xRadiant","date":"2018-12-01T18:19:37.882+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":8,"body":"Literally if youre gonna delete mine you better delete EVERYONE ELSES I SEE AT LEAST 8 ON THE FRONT PAGE ALONE","replies":[]}]}
