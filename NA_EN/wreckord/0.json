It can't negatively impact anything, only get you a smoother connection. It's not always going to be a guaranteed fix like any other tech troubleshooting, but knowing that one thing didn't help let's us know the direction we need to move in. One step will never be the final solution. Make sure you went through the port forwarding steps as well as the others listed in that guide if you haven't yet.\n\nIf those steps still don't help, go ahead and reach out to our techs in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) so they can look through some of your","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Wreckord","date":"2017-11-15T23:13:18.407+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I did what you said but its still not working....Im afraid it's not a connection problem but rather a game crash.

The reconnect button pops up, but for some reason, it's hidden behind the loading screen. This is why spamming enter works, eventually that enter spam will hit reconnect and force the client to start connecting again.","replies":[{"poster":"xevi","date":"2017-11-16T07:08:15.167+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I guess it doesn't work for me since I set the in-game League to override some Mac system commands (so I can cmd + q to level an ability instead of quitting the game). It's the only option where you have to be in-game to change it (can't find from settings > in-game).\n\nEdit: So I was right about the Mac system re-bind being an option only available in-game. I uninstalled the client and re-installed which reset the Mac system re-bind and spamming enter now works.
