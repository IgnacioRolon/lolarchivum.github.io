Mine was submitted 2 days ago and I haven't gotten a single response. Something like this happened before to me as well... I made a discussion similar to this one and they said that my ticket was accidentally put into the wrong category or something? That might not be the case this time, but I'm just curious as to how long this takes. Thanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-31T22:23:54.070+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It really depends on the type of ticket, but response times are a bit longer than normal right now due to a large number of tickets submitted recently.
