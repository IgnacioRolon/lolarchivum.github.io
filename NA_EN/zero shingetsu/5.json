People seem to really idolize pros in League. So the question is... Why the arrogance? I don&#039;t follow League&#039;s pro scene all that closely, so I could be wrong. But I know that I&#039;ve never had an opponent at the pro level rub it in when I lose. I&#039;ve never done it either, and I&#039;ve never felt a reason to. When the game is over, win or lose, you bow, congratulate eachother, and carry on. You&#039;d think if people were looking to go pro, they&#039;d look at how pros behave and seek to at least attempt to emulate it.\r\n\r\n&quot;gg ez&quot; is one of the things that irks me the most about NA, because it&#039;s not really reportable, it&#039;s just really rotten sportsmanship. In Houkou to Iou, if a pro acted like so many aspiring Challengers in League act after a match? They&#039;d be singled out by their peers in every kessen until they no longer wanted to play. We don&#039;t take kindly to pointless arrogance, and I wish League&#039;s lower-tier players would start feeling the same way. It&#039;s just _better_ for the game, and it&#039;s better for the players who do it too. My family has a saying: &quot;Hokoru tori wa sakana o ushinau.&quot; A bird who boasts loses his fish.","replies":[{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2017-08-29T01:39:59.553+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"cos faker is all, faker is life.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BigBellBrute","date":"2017-08-29T01:07:52.019+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1.

My game doesn't police behavior that doesn't directly breach terms of service, but we're still much better behaved... Maybe _this_ is partially why you see so much toxicity in League. League's pros should present a better image...","replies":[{"poster":"Takazaki","date":"2017-08-29T02:42:52.566+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"no this is not why leauge is toxic.\n\n**its human nature**\n\ntrick2g\ntyler1\ndoctordisrespect\nbizzaroflames ( although really chill IRL )\nchudat\nleffen\n\n\npeople like toxic behavior to an extent","replies":[{"poster":"Zero Shingetsu","date":"2017-08-29T02:53:17.948+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Takazaki,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=u8E1OALJ,comment-id=000200000000,timestamp=2017-08-29T02:42:52.566+0000)\n>\n> no this is not why leauge is toxic.\n> \n> **its human nature**\n> \n> trick2g\n> tyler1\n> doctordisrespect\n> bizzaroflames ( although really chill IRL )\n> chudat\n> leffen\n> \n> \n> people like toxic behavior to an extent\n\nI've... never heard of any of these people. Guess it's just a difference of cultures. I'm always careful to be calm and respectful in my streams, because I know others who play my game are apt to follow my behavior. At the very least, I'm representing my team and my family, and I feel a natural need to conduct myself well. It just kind of comes naturally where I'm from, I guess...","replies":[{"poster":"Takazaki","date":"2017-08-29T07:00:27.233+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the smash players its understandable not to have heard of them\n\nbut trick2g is a huge streamer/streaming group\n\nand tyler1 is a meme, the fact you havent seen him even in memes is astounding.","replies":[{"poster":"Zero Shingetsu","date":"2017-08-29T07:02:34.877+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Takazaki,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=u8E1OALJ,comment-id=00020000000000000000,timestamp=2017-08-29T07:00:27.233+0000)\n>\n> the smash players its understandable not to have heard of them\n> \n> but trick2g is a huge streamer/streaming group\n> \n> and tyler1 is a meme, the fact you havent seen him even in memes is astounding.\n\nHaha, I don't really pay attention to NA streamers.
