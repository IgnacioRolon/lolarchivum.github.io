No idea what it going on. \nFiles sowing issues are located in the user appdata and riot game files. Every fix i have tried to get this issue to stop has failed except disable my graphics card then i do not get bugsplat. But of course as any gamer would know shit graphics and the game is no longer smooth and it blows the size of everything up. I've been through the riot troubleshooting and even searched the interwebs with no luck. Now i also play Fallout, Diablo 3, and other games that require good graphics cards. And on all  of them games I never have an issue even at max settings and even with overclocking but just for league will i have issues. If anyone has a possible fix other than everything listed at (https://support.riotgames.com/hc/articles/201761974) I've tried up dating graphics card software even uninstalling it completely and installing the software from the original disk to updating everything possible and turning off the xbox dvr recording as i found that to be a possible fix for issues going on. Also I've uninstalled LOL and Reinstalled the old client in hopes that would fix my issues and still no go.

I tried to put it in windowed mode and that didn't fix it and now after i uninstalled the game and reinstalled then completely removed my graphics card and erased everything from it and then put the card back in and reinstalled the software from the disk now it is working in windowed mode. So i guess im now one of the affected players that are stuck on windowed mode until a fix is found.","replies":[]}]}]}
