It honestly sounds like there is an issue maintaining a consistent connection with our PvP.net Servers (the client) for a few minutes.  However, it might indicate a corruption with your installation as well.  Given this is much easier to troubleshoot, have you attempted to perform a [clean re-install of League of Legends](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202539040) to see if this helps to resolve it?\n\nLet me know if you are still experiencing any issues!","replies":[]}]}
