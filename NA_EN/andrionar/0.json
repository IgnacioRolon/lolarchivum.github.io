Unclear whether that’ll mean some degree of rework or just significant balance changes.*\" http://www.newsoflegends.com/index.php/tag/ryze/\n\nIt&#039;s hilarious that poor Twisted fate probably mistakenly came in to Ryze flash range and was unable to get out of snares while until dead, becouse Ryze wasn't even ahead.\nWhat&#039;s the counter play to this?\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9s3917_ztE\n\n**Obviously, Riot a little bit overdid with recent nerfs to Ryze, becouse they were unable to find a proper fix for him at the moment**, but I rather see him unplayable then in the same state as he was in LCS. Ryze is hard - impossible to balance, becouse every try so far have failed and probably requires a Sion level rework.\n\nA lot of Ryze players while trying to prove that he was balanced before these brutal nerfs, are trying to excuse him by using incorrect arguments.\n\n\"*He had an average - low win rate*\". An average win rate doesn&#039;t mean that champions is balanced, especialy then talking about certain champions like Ryze with hes state before the nerfs.\n\nRyze was insane in SoloQ if mastered. At level 6 as Darius, Nasus or any other tank/fighter, even with  90+ MR I got wrecked while playing against decent-good Ryze players with nearly any meele champion. Starting from level 6 I got one shoted everytime I was in Ryze range.\n\nI remember one game. I was ahead while playing nasus, I had Spectre&#039;s cowl, Mercury threads and KindleGem and a full Health. Enemie Ryze roamed me from mid, being barely one level ahead, while having 2 kills. After pushing the wave, he dived me under my tower. I hardly had enought time to flash out off hes endless cc's, but he fallowed me with hes own flash afterwards for a finish combo. **Does it even sound balanced**?\n\n**Edited:**\nfor people who think that Diana and Malzahar are healthy becouse they're immobile. I will tell you what Riot said about them 3-8 months ago in some of theyr posts. Gonna repost them later if I'll be able to find.\n\nAccording to Riot, Diana isn't well balanced champion, becouse if ahead, she can burst enemie team in a matter of seconds, if she's not ahead, she feels to weak, becouse she has to get in to people faces, but will get focused and killed before being able to make a noticable impact.\n\nAccording to Riot, Malzahar isn't very exciting to play and doesn't feel fun to play against eather, becouse of hes frustrating kit.\n\n**Sorry, for not being clearer and not being able to remember everything, but as I said, I gonna edit my post agen if I'll find these specific Rito posts about diana and Malza.**","replies":[{"poster":"Zero Skill Tank","date":"2016-02-14T20:31:35.567+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":4,"body":"The problem was not that he could flash-combo TF, because many, many champs could do that.\n\nThe problem was that he was able to do the same to tanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Hayaishi2","date":"2016-02-14T20:34:43.623+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=BigBadBadger,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=v5tVtUqv,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-02-14T20:31:35.567+0000)\n>\n> The problem was not that he could flash-combo TF, because many, many champs could do that.\n> \n> The problem was that he was able to do the same to tanks.\n\nHe is not even fed and he dropped TF in 3 seconds flat while perma ccing him.

Imo it should be his ultimate. You ever wonder why Ryze with passive on is 10x better than Ryze with ult on?

Ryze needs some work.  Landing 1 skill-shot should not instantly decide the outcome of a fight, yet Ryze's followup chain combo pretty much ensures that you die while cc-locked if he is even slightly ahead.  I don't know that Ryze is more toxic than some other champs though, like Riven/Ahri, who can also kill you after landing one CC but don't even need to flash in order to gapclose...\n\nI think Ryze is in the same category as Annie.  They might be a bit toxic/binary, but not quite as oppressive as certain other champions.  As for Malzahar, I don't think he's even really a problem considering he is immobile and suppresses himself in teamfights while being simple to counterbuild during laning.  I think Malzahar is less frustrating/problematic than a lot of common mid laners ({{champion:238}} {{champion:103}}).

He's useless except for those 6-8 seconds hes in his passive.  You cant lose to a ryze who just hits you with Q's and tries to go in for a 3 move combo.  He has clear counter play.  Stay away from him while his passive is up. Oh you got flashed on? React faster and flash away.  Hes 2/3 point and click, so he HAS to be in range to do anything. Stay out of range and your fine. As soon as his passive goes down? Blow him up? Cant blow him up? Hard push him to tower and roam.  Im just tired of people bitching because they die to ryze when they put themselves in the literal worst position to fight him.\n\nHe probably needed some number tweaks on abilities, but to cap his passive at 5 is just absurd.
