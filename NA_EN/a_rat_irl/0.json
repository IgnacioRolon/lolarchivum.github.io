I haven't done anything to my computer, or the client. I installed the beta, but it was working properly until today. I was playing early and logged off to go to school. Then at night, when I tried to login the mention problem happened. Tried to repair, and did nothing. Tried also to download the game again, but the page fails to load when I try to start the download of the installer. Will appreciate any kind of help on the matter, and would like to know if it's happening to anyone else.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-24T05:31:08.512+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We experienced some service outage problems yesterday around the time you posted this, that have been resolved by now.
