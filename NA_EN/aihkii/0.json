I searched online for a while and in reply to a forum post I found mention of level 2 being the minimum to join a club, but that doesn't seem to be the only requirement. I'm guessing the account also needs to have existed for a couple days or a week or something.? \r\n\r\nIt's not that big of a deal, but I do think this should be mentioned somewhere clearly. I searched all over and only found one single mention of the level 2 requirement, and nothing about the account age requirement if there is one. I think the [Guide to Clubs](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207994746-Guide-to-Clubs) post on the Riot Support site should mention this info, since it doesn't even mention that new accounts can't join clubs. In any case, I just feel this information should be made clear somewhere.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nAihkii","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-07-25T18:20:22.172+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Thanks for the feedback here!  It's insight we've received previously and looking into updating the article already.  Just for some reassurance, though, it does look like you need to be at least level 2 to create a club, but level 1 to join.  Account's age should not matter.  Hope that  helps clears things up!","replies":[{"poster":"Aihkii","date":"2017-09-07T18:37:40.123+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I only just realized this actually got a reply a month later.. whoops. But I will say there definitely was some kind of cutoff. I wasn't able to invite either level 1 account. It was something like 3 days before I could invite either account, by which time they were both level 2, but I couldn't invite immediately upon reaching level 2, so the ~3 day gap seems to be the relevant part.","replies":[{"poster":"jessipoop","date":"2018-01-16T05:48:55.577+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"im level 8 and still cant join club SOOOO CONFUSEDDD","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"m12lrvRvsB","date":"2018-01-21T01:17:40.706+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"even after this i still can not invite some of my friends it says they are new to the game even after you said account's age should not matter","replies":[]},{"poster":"CommanderComment","date":"2018-03-07T22:54:24.383+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://i.imgur.com/xtW6EXC.png?1\n\nfrom the client when trying to invite","replies":[{"poster":"Flooof","date":"2018-03-12T01:53:33.422+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=CommanderComment,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=h9J60xGo,comment-id=00000002,timestamp=2018-03-07T22:54:24.383+0000)\n>\n> https://i.imgur.com/xtW6EXC.png?1\n> \n> from the client when trying to invite\n\nGetting this too when trying to invite my level 9 friend.
