VEIGAR.","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":3,"down_votes":14,"body":"Veigar.\n\nAll you gotta do is just press QWER and you instantly get a kill. There are so many games that we were close to winning but the Veigar just got free kills and just stacked up on AP and murdered our whole team. She is not anywhere CLOSE to being balanced. I am suggesting some changes for her.\n\n**Passive: Hitting enemies with your abilities no longer adds stacks of Phenomenal Evil.**\n\nIt is almost too easy to hit enemies with your abilities, whether it be your long range double hitting Q, your massive E and then a W as a follow up, or just simply hitting R. Do you really think you should be getting free AP off of this?\n\n**W: Remove CDR that scales with Phenomenal Evil stacks.**\nW becomes way too spammy in mid/late game, and you don't even have to worry about missing because it has a super low cooldown.\n\n**E: Larger radius, Wall duration decreased to 2 seconds, Being caught in the wall stuns you for the remaining duration.**\nA larger radius would be both a buff and a nerf, as Veigar has more range to cast her E but this also gives any trapped people more room to actually dodge her abilities. The wall duration is also way too long and gives her and her team enough time to follow up and deal massive damage. The last one is both a  buff and nerf as being hit by the wall immediately gives more stun duration, but you can't be stunned as long if you walk out of it after.\n\n**R: Decreased damage, ~~remove the annoying laugh when R kills an enemy.~~**\nPretty self-explanatory. She just does too much damage. Maybe decrease the initial damage but just increase the executing damage, so you can't just press R to kill everyone.\n\nThese nerfs might be too much, you can argue. Maybe seeing SOME of these would be great. It would really improve the quality of my games because I am sick and tired of playing against her.","replies":[{"poster":"MankeyMadness","date":"2019-03-05T00:01:20.628+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"DUDE THIS BURST MAGE BURSTED ME.

The other thing is the space inside his cage. It is more than enough to dodge the spells he throws as his W does not have such a huge radius.\n\nAnother thing about Veigar is his lack of mobility. His only hope to survive is either getting the enemies stunned by his E or by trying to burst them before they do. This make champions such as {{champion:38}} {{champion:238}} {{champion:55}} hard to deal with in lane and later on in the game due to their mobility and ability to bypass the stun cage easily. Also anything with good CC, ranged or not is a pain for Veigar to deal with. \n\nAll in all Veigar is a good champion but he is not really that impossible to win. Anything outside his range or right next to him is able to kill him. Also one last tip, using Zhonya's/stopwatch or anything that makes the champion untargetable (Yi Q, Vlad pool etc.) after Veig has pressed R, is able to cancel his ult and put it on cooldown.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ANearMiss","date":"2019-06-25T02:21:47.146+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Veigar is male first off, secondly, I quit reading after that.","replies":[]},{"poster":"QmegaSquadVeigar","date":"2019-03-05T09:50:20.477+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"xd, Imagine complaining about one of the most telegraphed champion with clear counterplay that barely does anything in the first 12 minutes of the game if you aren't a terrible plat Zed who can't dodge Veigar's abilities and walks into the stun taking minion aggro and dying at lvl 4.
