Team lost without me, i got past it. However I got 5 games in low priority. I was on the 4th game of low priority when the black screen happened again, in ranked. Now i have 5 more. I am not leaving these games on purpose, i am getting black screened. Fix your game, this isn't my fault. My resolution of the cfg file is the same as my computer as well. I tried everything I could think of. I am going to get banned from this crap eventually or I won't be able to play at all. The black screen is random so  I just cant play the game ever. I wait 20 minutes in low priority q for a black screen and another 5 games of low priority q. This is dumb and I dont deserve these restrictions.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-16T03:34:48.926+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Most of the time those black screens are caused by some kind of weird software or driver interaction. Essentially your pc is having a hard time figuring out how to display League's graphics. My first suggestion is: if you keep getting these black screen errors I would try focusing on fixing this issue before queueing up for any more PVP matches, otherwise you are putting yourself at risk of getting more penalties.\n\nA good first place to start troubleshooting these black screens is with this handy [**FPS guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting). Go through each step there, making sure to update drivers and such along the way, and test those changes in a custom or practice game first to make sure you'll be able to load the match.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Flayboi Mansion","date":"2017-05-16T02:07:49.877+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"HELP ME","replies":[]}]}
