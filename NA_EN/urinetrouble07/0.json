Not to mention more than 60% of these champs are 4800 or 6300.  You can wait on shards for sure but we all know that the odds are forever not in your favor.  In my last glorious capsule, i got Yi Alistar and Lissandra.  Now you might say well you got a 4800 BE champ ?  But i have no interest to play this champ and if I sell these now then its going to take even longer to get these champs for a decent amount of BE.  Most basic champion capsules will give you the basic champions and if you're lucky its going to be a 3150 champ.  Can we please have our freedom back instead of being shit on by Rito and told what champs we should play.","replies":[]}
