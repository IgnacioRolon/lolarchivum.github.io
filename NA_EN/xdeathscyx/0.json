One of Nasus's primary weaknesses is closing on his targets, so if he's on attacking damage/squishy champs that means the enemy team is likely not playing correctly against you, and that's all the buff you need. Giving him almost 50% armor shred on his E would just make him good at everything, which I really don't feel he needs anymore after his changes several months ago.","replies":[{"poster":"Thryale","date":"2017-10-20T06:33:02.720+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"what changes did he get those months ago, if you don't mind my asking?

I find that odd seeing how Lol has changed so much over the years; I find Twisted a bit out dated. Think about it his stun is literally his everything and more and more champs are coming with means of avoiding it, even with at max cdr you can get it down to 3 secs but a lot can happen in 3 secs and he literally offers nothing but dmg while it's down.\n\nSurely he can get some love if you compare other champs to him they are allowed a lot more.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Kirius Dark","date":"2017-10-19T19:38:27.338+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think you're onto something.
