If I create my own game and keep leaving and making a new one, eventually ill join and my ms will be constant at 39ms. which is what I normally get. But as soon as I join a new game it will jump right back to 300+. I don't understand this because when it is at 39ms it will stay that way throughout the whole match but then the next game jumps up. I've already had 3 tech guys from time warner come out and check everything. Im on my third modem. None of them were able to figure out what was wrong.\r\n\r\nNotes: Yes i am hardwired into the modem with cat6 cable. I normally have around 432 mbps download speed.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-05T02:56:12.400+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Downlink speeds (432Mbps) rarely impact the latency you'll see between you and a server. This is because the two are almost entirely unrelated. Downlink speed helps determine at which (data) rate you can receive data from a server, while latency determines the measurable time it takes for a packet to hit a server and then come back to your PC. Latency (ping) issues are by far the most common issue we see from players, and they're most often caused by an issue along network routing or by a local network configuration that doesn't play well with League. In order to troubleshoot this further, we'll need to ensure your local network settings are in good standing by having you work through our [**connection guide.**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues)\n\nPlease let me know if you continue to see high latency in-game after taking those steps.","replies":[{"poster":"Curry245","date":"2017-01-09T03:24:55.389+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I tried all of this.

If your router/modem were provided by your ISP, you may want to reach out to them regarding any available firmware updates or factory resetting and reconfiguring your home network equipment. The rest of your route shows consistently high latency which could be caused by a bad modem/router as well.
