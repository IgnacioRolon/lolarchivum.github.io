Furthermore, without them posted, we can't tell if you are being honest about how toxic you really were. If the ban was given due to poor behaviour, Riot has mentioned many times in the past that they would prefer you spend your money elsewhere, and not make a new account.\n\nIf you didn't get chat logs (your reform card), check you email. It is also possible that you may have been banned for an entirely different reason than poor behaviour. In which case I would recommend contacting [player support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) to get more information.\n\nIf it was a behavioural ban and you don't want to provide your chat logs to us on these boards and want to appeal the ban privately, and don't want public criticism you should still open a [player support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).\n\nI hope your future games go well, and I hope if the ban was for a different reason, or if it was a mistake, that you can play again soon.","replies":[]}]}
