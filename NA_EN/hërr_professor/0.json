Yasuo afk'd since the begining, but we suspected he would come back after checking his op.gg. I mean, who wouldn't want to play with a 92% winrate Yasuo? Unlucky for us, he never showed up. Please, can I get my 17 LP back?

That system is in place to help prevent these kinds of things from happening.\n\nThese aren't cases for loss prevented, it gets turned on when the servers experience region-wide issues where an entire region is impacted.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chermorg","date":"2018-01-29T16:19:17.279+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Loss prevented is only enabled in cases of large scale issues with Riot servers or a major ISP/node in the networking. Loss prevented is not designed for, and is in fact explicitly not used for, cases where a player is AFK. Your choice to remake or not was made - and that is your choice. You sadly must now live with the result of choosing not to remake and play out the game with an AFK.","replies":[]}]}
