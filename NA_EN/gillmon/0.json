I have had this problem for a month or two now, I have played league for a little under a year. Durring this time my ping has remained a stable 120-160 depending on the time of day.

The traceroute you provided is good, but I recommend downloading [WinMTR ](http://winmtr.net/winmtr-v0-92-now-available/)so we can get a better view of where exactly your connection is going.  I also recommend using our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to rule out any possibilities of local issues as well.  I'd like to help as much as I can, but also keep in mind that you do have that physical distance that could cause issues as well.  Let me know if you have any questions and hit me up with those logs!","replies":[]}]}
