This means I can't play nor spectate anyone's game. A problem may be my internet connection, but I don't think that's it, since it's been going on fro 2 days, and I haven't had problems patching anything else before. I tried literally everything: Restarting computer, restarting the client, and even reinstalling the game. Nothing seems to work. I'm getting really frustrated at this point. The play button freezes at zero percent and doesn't move from there. When you hover over it it just says scanning: Files scanned: 1 or 2 and releasemanifest. Please help. I'm getting tired of writing walls of text.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-03T01:05:01.313+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think we can get that patch working again pretty easily if you're getting stuck below 30% on the patcher.
