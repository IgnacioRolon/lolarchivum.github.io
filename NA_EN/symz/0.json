I looked at the logs, which i will post, and riot&#039;s &quot;Reason for punishment&quot; is a game where I had an udyr who was doing nothing but flaming his team and feeding, and me and him argued in chat until I muted him because I was bored and waiting for 20 mins so we could ff, since he fed a kha and there was no way we were coming back from that. Not to mention it was during the april fools thing, so I dont even see how I got enough reports for it to be noticed, considering none of the enemy team reported anyone, obviously. Other game was one of my &quot;friends&quot; talking shit to me and me talking shit to him. We were having a one on one conversation that did not involve either one of us being toxic to anyone aside from eachother, so I dont see how that&#039;s a valid reason to chat restrict me lol. Last one was a recent one, I had a darius flaming me and accusing me of flaming our jg, when all I said was &quot;I havent seen yi in my lane yet&quot;, as you will see in the chat logs. Yes, I did flame the darius eventually after I got tired of watching him flame me for no reason at all, and yes I should have muted him and not done anything other than that. But, I dont see how the other two games can be counted as &quot;Bad behavior&quot;? The udyr that apparently ended up reporting me was reported by everyone on my team, and I didnt get a notification of him receiving any punishment, so why am I receiving punishment for that when he was literally the only person who reported me, and he only reported me because he was being toxic in any way he could lol. I just fail to understand the reason behind the chat restriction, and I wouldnt care about the chat restriction, but I&#039;m pretty sure that counts towards my overall record for bad behavior, which can eventually lead to a ban, and I lose my chances to get loot boxes and keys, etc. I dont see how this is justifiable in this situation. Please reconsider.

a man who works married to a woman who takes care of the home and children that were expected to grow up and do the same.\n\nso lets say someone was born at the end of that era (as many of the older generation were). they have the option of either growing up to carry on the tradition or forsake the tradition to start a new one. in the 60s many many people set out to create a new tradtion that promoted drug abuse, sexual experimentation, and anarchy - those people had children sometime around the 70's and early 80's and their children grew up without tradition - or in other words without a purpose or goal - because the idea of anarchy is very radical in and of itself. the children born in the 70's experienced the failures of the government pretty much daily and were encouraged by the ideas of their parents to carry on the tradition of anarchy, drug abuse, and sexual experimentation. that generation would have children in the 90s and early 2000's with constant looming thoughts about the end of the world coming up, the military no longer drafted soldiers so the realities of war were lost on many, and internet was created so many many many chances for propaganda started springing up.\n\nthe children that passed on the older traditions to the next generation quickly became lost among the ones that passed on the new traditions simply because drugs are addicting, sex is instinctual, and the idea of no laws sounds great in theory, but when put to practice is a complete nightmare. who doesnt want to be their own boss?\n\nso after 2 generations of welfare for the many people who refused to carry on tradition the government has simply ran out of money to give and all of those families that strayed from tradition no longer have any means to support themselves because they didnt pass down skills and knowledge to the next generation because quite frankly they didnt have any to pass down in the first place.\n\nmany of the children of the 90's and 2000's grew up poor and in broken homes with parents who knew very little about what it meant to be successful being told they're inferior and they're wrong and if they want something they should work for it - which is ironic coming from people who did not. so those children did work and learned and honestly most of that generation started to surpass their elders thanks to the internet, but then they stumbled across the propaganda and the ideas of the failed tradition and started to berate their elders for the mistakes they made and blaming others became a habit.\n\nso skip forward 20 years and you have people unwilling to accept advice from others and constantly blaming others for their own faults because it has become tradition. to work hard and you'll be rich - which is complete bull. you can slave away your entire life and it wont matter. and its not because corporations are greedy, but because our traditions are completely flawed. and people are starting to realize that now and because of that many are starting to give up, lose hope, or become completely berserk and striking out against others.\n\nnow lets go back to those that DID pass down the traditions from the 50's - their families are still successful. they took the knowledge of their elders and had it crammed down their throats until they were able to succeed and filled the void left by those who turned away from tradition. the children that were born in the 70's became business owners and expanded upon their own knowledge by getting into college. their children were born in the 90's and are the rich entitled kids who we see from time to time driving around in their parents cars - their parents angry at the world for how much they had to work just to end up middle class when the other members of their generation were allowed to get by on government funds.\n\nso the whole \"entitled\" thing is more or less just a backlash of breaking away from tradition.  women and men no longer know how to approach each other so there's a major loss of identity and of course it's causing the ripple effect we see now-a-days.\n\nin other words yes children are taught to be this way. only those with certification should be allowed an opinion and anyone else is just an annoyance that doesnt deserve the right to exist. you see it everywhere. employment, debates, community settings, schools, etc. and it's justified by the idea that there are too many people in the world.\n\nsad isnt it?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2017-04-03T21:05:44.707+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That is understood, but these discussions are for the community's benefit rather than just the OP, so even if the OP doesn't learn anything there are others who will read this that will.","replies":[{"poster":"BLACK REALM GOD","date":"2017-04-04T04:43:26.789+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"i mean i get that, but it doesnt affect a majority of the playerbase. only a few players like you and me and bonobo even scour the behavior boards looking in on discussions.\n\ni dont want to call it wasted effort because it's not, but it's not the most efficient way to reach the community.\n\nthere has to be a better way.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"GodKing Thumper","date":"2017-04-06T23:39:42.612+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I don't understand why behavior like the OP's isn't escalated to a permaban manually.
