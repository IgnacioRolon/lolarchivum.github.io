We are promised a lot and therefore our expectations are constantly rising - and that is even moreso given the vast amount of time since the retcon (10 months) to fix things.\r\n\r\nTech issues. Shorter Bios. Promises.\r\n\r\nSo this is what&#039;s going to happen:\r\n\r\n&quot;_The greater the anticipation, the greater the disappointment_&quot;\r\n\r\nI think League prides itself on producing not a living, breathing world, but a spectacle world. It&#039;s trying it&#039;s damn hardest to look cool to catch that momentary interest before fading away. Then it expects to be given props for doing that.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m going to go off on some education/social theory now regarding why League Lore is so inadequate.\r\n\r\nLook, there are three forms of engagement:\r\n**Behavioral engagement -** People do this everyday out of force of habit\r\n[e.g. Someone who goes to work and flips burgers. It&#039;s not the strongest form of engagement but it&#039;s still engagement. Other examples include putting the toilet down and etc - essentially force of habits that become almost second nature]\r\n\r\nThis is the sort of engagement most of the Board actually engages in. We sign on to play League for the first-win of the day bonus. We log onto the boards to check stuff out/up or downvote/check reddit/comment/post/etc...\r\n\r\n**Emotional engagement **- Something new stimulates a response\r\n[e.g. There&#039;s a fire or a burglary happens or someone buys a new car or something EXPLODES. It stimulates the effect of either fear or happiness - some emotional response - and that makes people want to know more about it]\r\n\r\nThis is clearly the form of engagement the narrative team wants and is also poorly implemented. Emotional engagement is actually the weakest over time as it cannot sustain itself (usually once it&#039;s out of sight, it&#039;s forgotten). Yet the Narrative and marketing departments repeatedly focus on this, but with several months in between these bursts of activity - it&#039;s not enough to keep players interested and certainly not entertained or happy.\r\n\r\n**Cognitive engagement** - It&#039;s so interesting that people FEEL compelled to seek more knowledge of it.\r\n[e.g. A riddle or a logic puzzles a student so they continue to think about. A difficult game or challenge occurs and people seek more knowledge of it. Think of how much theorycrafting people do for games like EVE, Starcraft, Diablo, and etc... there&#039;s clearly a force of interest that sustains itself much more greatly than either behavioral or emotional does. People will be ACTIVELY thinking of new ideas instead of consuming them and accepting them - asking themselves how this change will affect them. This is the kind of stuff you see in the SurrenderAt20 PBE updates where people are theorycrafting and discussing balance changes.]\r\n\r\nThis is the strongest form of engagement and certainly the one Riot should be aiming for as it produces the best longevity of any series. Warhammer especially is filled with it because as detailed as the world is - there&#039;s still so much mystery and open ended unknowns to the several running plotpoints. Granted the fans may disagree on several key detail points - but this only shows how much stronger the engagement and thus connection to the game is.\r\n\r\n**And that&#039;s why the Narrative team will fail: **_they focus too much on emotional engagement rather than cognitive engagement._\r\n\r\nWe&#039;re going to get another spectacle burst. Bilgewater happens but nothing substantial gets added. There&#039;s no new information - nothing to theorycraft on - just nothing. Oh hey we added some flavor text. Oh hey we have a new map and a few paragraphs of bio. \r\n\r\nThat&#039;s not enough.\r\n\r\nThere&#039;s no where near enough. Because those who are cognitively engaged will exhaust all of that in an afternoon before going &#039;well, what now? I&#039;m done and there&#039;s not enough here to actually answer the questions I have... if I have any.&#039; \r\n\r\nI am confident that whatever lore the Narrative throws out at Bilgewater is going to look great, cool, awesome, and shallow as crap. There&#039;s no depth. There&#039;s no mystery. What the hell does the word Buhru or whatever mean to me IF I DON&#039;T HAVE A GODDAMN MAP? What&#039;s the point of all these pirate captain-kings and outlaws and bandits if I don&#039;t even know what Bilgewater looks like? MUCH LESS WHERE IT IS ON THE MAP. How am I suppose to go beyond the crappy trope-ladened-fest that it&#039;s a pirate cove den (done repeatedly to death by other franchises) and ask myself: Hm, how is this different from any other generic fantasy franchise?\r\n\r\nIt looks cooler? Thanks to the Art team.\r\n\r\nBut does it tell a better story? Does it make me want to know more about the world? Can I find the answers I&#039;m looking for in text, audio interactions, or flavor text and not have to be spoonfed in imprompto AMAs by the narrative team members?\r\n\r\nYeah. When most of our current lore understanding comes from random Riot red posts popping up now and then - that&#039;s a bad sign.\r\n\r\nIt&#039;s going to take months of consistent lore releases, reversals, and some serious output by Narrative to reverse this. Otherwise, once again:\r\n\r\n&quot;The greater the anticipation, the greater the disappointment.&quot;\r\n\r\ntl:dr - Bilgewater will entertain us for a day then we will go back to feeling empty and hollow after our lore-drug fix.","replies":[{"poster":"Variks the Loyal","date":"2015-07-12T00:45:51.490+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":0,"body":"They really need to find an avenue for storytelling.\n\nThey could go the normal way - Novels, comics, short stories, etc...\n\nThey could also go out of the box - Animated shorts, or an animated series, an in-game story/career mode...\n\nThere's so much potential. I think they're too worried about trying to discover a new way to deliver narrative that no one's done before, and they either haven't found it or have just fallen flat in trying. I don't care if they start putting out comics - That's a tried and true method that lots of franchises use, and could make us lore fans really happy. But they can't deliver a good narrative through, for example, champion specific shopkeeper quotes, or on item flavor text. Those are tastes, and like {{champion:223}} says, \"I DEMAND AN ENTREE!\"","replies":[{"poster":"Xulsigae","date":"2015-07-12T00:55:48.799+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"They also aren't very easy to pay attention to in a fast paced game. It works for MMOs and RPGs where reading text or listening to quotes is easy to do because one isn't being rushed. A quote in League is all well and good but often requires one to taunt in the middle of a fight where it will probably be muffled by all the other spells and such being cast and get you killed for doing a taunt in the middle of battle. Also one has to know to taunt someone specifically, at which point you would have to read the quote before hand thereby rendering the in game interaction moot.","replies":[{"poster":"Darrosh Jewfist","date":"2015-07-12T01:19:14.335+0000","up_votes":26,"down_votes":2,"body":"Yeah, the idea that you need to TAUNT an enemy within range to get basically an Easter Egg interaction is cool - but it shouldn't be the main driving force of lore delivery. I mean, is Riot promoting poor gameplay option (taunting an enemy within range and leaving you open to harass and within LoS) vs. getting to hear these interactions?\n\nThere are so many better ways to deliver on this.\n\nWhy don't they try...\n\n- Unique Fountain/Game start quotes. Like if Ashe and Sejuani are on opposite teams Ashe goes \"i got dibs on the pig\" or Sejuani says \"I'm going to break that Archer's pretty little neck.\"\n- If an enemy successfully ults/uses a certain move on another champion. For example, if Gangplank successfully ults an MF he can taunt \"Haha! Prepare to be boarded!\" And if she stays during the entire duration he'll keep on taunting, \"How do you like MY rain, Fortune!?\"\n- Interactions just for attacking certain enemies. For example: Lucian and Thresh can be expected to be pretty common lane opponents. So if Lucian keeps shooting at Thresh he can say \"That was for Sena!\" and if Thresh hits back he can say \"Your wife says 'saaaaveee meeee!'\n\nAll of this, not only is so much easier to trigger than taunting an enemy but also makes the action feel so much natural and alive. Imagine if Demacian heroes just managed to score a kill together with Lux taking the kill but Garen got the assist. Lux might say 'Score one for me!' and Garen goes 'Don't you mean score one for us?'\n\nJust... simple, interactions BUILT during the course of expected and natural gameplay. That way, instead of people who may not check up on specific interactions and spend each and every game taunting enemies - these interactions occur naturally over time.\n\nFor example, if these sort of interactions were in placed - a dedicated Garen player might soon realize he has a boatload of unique interactions. This might encourage him to main another character he likes to see if he has other interactions (for example if he likes Jarvan and Jarvan has a unique interaction just for ulting a Darius and say 'GET DUNK'D!)\n\n;_; so much potential","replies":[{"poster":"BetaDude40","date":"2015-07-12T06:08:42.692+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":2,"body":"I read all of those quotes in the characters' voices. :D\n\nI would think that the methods they have for showing us lore is immense, and that the writers on the lore team are well-experienced in writing. I would think that they, of all people, would know where to take the lore and how to shape it.\n\nBut honestly, over the past 10 months, I have no reason to listen to them. I've enlisted in Factions (make this shameless advertisement \\#5537635463...), and as far as my head-canon will care, their words mean nothing to me anymore. At the retcon announcement, I was devastated, but I had a feeling that they could direct the lore to even better content. I trusted them, and I made a mistake in doing so.\n\nI mean, hell, if they claim they can't make new lore because they don't know how to edit a .txt file (I still think the \"technical issue\" excuse is beyond bullshit at this point), then how can we trust them to treat Runeterra like anything other than a marketing ploy that funnels people in with cool visuals and takes them to the LCS? Obviously, gameplay is way more important than lore, but giving meaning and purpose as well as an understanding of a character's personality and experiences can keep people engaged in League.\n\nI know this might receive downvotes just because of the seemingly natural hatred towards him, but I would not be playing this game today if it weren't for Teemo. When I was being consistently abused by people in my level 20-30 climb, I felt compelled to press the uninstall button and never play this game again. What made me come back was Teemo. Something about how he has a cute exterior and an extremely dark, sociopathic desire for killing is an interesting character design, and of any champion in the game that I like, Teemo is very far up there (behind {{champion:161}}, of course). Lore and character personalities can keep players engaged, because they don't want to let go of them. I honestly feel like Teemo is attached to me in some way (I'm still not sure if this is a good thing...), and he is something I couldn't forget about.\n\nAll in all, I've probably just been rambling and I need to go to sleep. The potential for storytelling and the purpose behind it is overwhelming, but the lore we get is so disgusting and empty that I think the \"big thing\" they have by the end of this month will just be another flop. I wish I could trust them, but I'm afraid that bond between me and the official story is completely lost now, as I dive deeper into the realms of fanfiction and head-canon.","replies":[{"poster":"Sneak Dog","date":"2015-07-12T13:07:55.278+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":">I would think that the methods they have for showing us lore is immense, and that the writers on the lore team are well-experienced in writing.

I think Riots writers are entirely inexperienced in writing lore for videogames, treating it as writing a book about over one-hundred characters.\n\nElse they would've actually used the game to bring lore. They wouldn't have disconnected the stories they tell and the game. They did, either because they weren't up to the challenge or think this is a better way of doing lore.\n\nI'm fine with that though, I like books.

For example, I think (again, no quoting :P) that one of the main producers of Avatar: The Last Airbender might be on the lore team. To be honest, I don't have a spreadsheet or something with whoever is working on the lore team, I just heard that somewhere before. I'd imagine other similar writers are also onboard, with whoever that Warhammer 40k guy was that joined recently (I haven't played any of the Warhammer games. Something tells me I need to). What is puzzling is why are all of these experienced writers have such a hard time with the lore?\n\nI don't think we'll ever truly know the problem, especially with the lore team's complete disconnection to the community. All we know is that it has been 10 months since the retcon announcement, and all we've gotten are 3 poorly executed lore events (I'm counting Freljord, as well as Shurima and Shadow Isles. The first one just kind of faded to obscurity, and we never got to hear of an outcome, while they also retcon Trundle completely. Shurima was entirely done to shoehorn Azir into the game somehow, but in the process almost every champion we knew that was or was not quite associated with Shurima was changed completely (hello Skarner). The Shadow Isles thing is probably the lesser of the three evils, but it really isn't all that better. It literally told us nothing other than \"vengeance spear, betch\", unless you're willing to dig 500 miles into the forum to find that Kalista story again)\n\nI'll be nice for once. I'll give them some time. But if we reach the official 1-year Anniversary of the retcon, without so much of a smidgen of something good, then it's official that the writers are completely incompetent at their job, that the retcon completely failed (as if that's not apparent enough), and that Riot may have lost a large playerbase that did actually care, unlike the lore team.","replies":[{"poster":"Sneak Dog","date":"2015-07-12T16:02:13.931+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"A bookwriter doesn't necessarily make a good moviewriter. \nRiot tells good stories, but they explicitly abandoned the idea of writing videogame lore.\n\nI've already stopped caring about the new lore.

Even when we have heard \"we at Riot know we are not doing a good job of communicating\" (over a year ago), people didn't trust that statement. And their distrust has been proven. It's not that you coming on here saying \"I understand\" that is the problem. It's the fact that even though we are told over and over that Riot wishes to communicate more, we end up getting less. What drives people to attack your statements has more to do with the fact that nothing has happened.\n\nYou are in a catch 22. If you don't answer, then it proves even more to the boards that Riot doesn't care. If you do with a simple \"I don't know but I'm hopeful\", then there is massive eye rolls for seeing such a statement for close to two years now.\n\n> \n> I _want_ to start threads and discussions on all sorts of things - I want to talk about Ionia and pick all your brains on the intricacies of that complicated nation!
