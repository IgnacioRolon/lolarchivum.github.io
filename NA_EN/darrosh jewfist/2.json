That means the Winter&#039;s Claw Tribe doesn&#039;t farm and it appears to simply recruit warriors from the villages it visits.\r\n\r\nThey also basically live in an Arctic/Tundra environment.\r\n\r\nAfter doing my best to research, the only northern/arctic culture I&#039;ve found that subsists on a hunter-gatherer culture are the Inuits who, in their peak, numbered some 100,000 - man, woman, and child. And that&#039;s an area basically spanning from Alaska to Greenland. Their numbers have grown thanks to the advent of supplies and prepackaged food, but the current number of hunter-gatherers has dwindled quite a bit.\r\n\r\nBut the thing is, Inuit-Inuit conflicts are very rare. Partly because of their cultural background which is much more communal oriented but also because they&#039;re basically scattered across such a wide area since they can&#039;t all hunt in the same area or else they&#039;d over-hunt and starve themselves.\r\n\r\nSo it&#039;s like... Sejuani, _what are you doing_?\r\n\r\nI just find it extremely hard to believe Sejuani even knows what she&#039;s doing. She has no sustainable supply of food other than raids. Her income and supplies comes from what she seizes. And she has no plan to actually settle down and cultivate a civilization due to her aversion to agriculture. Like, how do the Winter&#039;s Claw even survive without agriculture and I guess the short answer is that they don&#039;t since Sejuani&#039;s the sole sibling to survive into adulthood.\r\n\r\nIt just seems suicidal. Even if by some miracle she manages to beat out the Avarosan or the Frostguard, Demacia and Noxus will go &#039;lol, no more food for u&#039; and will steamroll them. \r\n\r\ntl:dr - closest example to Winter&#039;s Claw are the Inuits and the Inuits don&#039;t have the manpower or food to wage war so why is the Winter&#039;s Claw going on this suicidal war?","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2015-06-22T00:48:54.314+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":1,"body":"Interesting!\n\nSo, to me, it seems that the Winter's Claw tribe is somewhat parasitic in nature.  We know they do not 'sow seeds and till the earth' and that Sejuani A) compares her tribe to a wolf, and B) she rides a bloody great big boar.  Neither a wolf or a boar is a herbivore in nature, and (while the wolf would prefer meat exclusively) they are both omnivores - they'll eat whatever they can get.\n\nHere's a list of possible food sources that don't stretch the imagination toooooo much, I hope:\n\n* Reindeer/Caribou (or equivalent)\n * Meat (raw, boiled, roasted, smoked, dried, salted, lye-rotted)\n * Partially digested lichen (from reindeer stomachs)\n * Blood (consumed fresh or used in soup, sausage, or a sort of 'tofu')\n * Milk (raw, fermented, cheese, dried, butter, yogurt)\n * Bones (stock, marrow)\n* Whale/Seal/Walrus (or equivalent)\n * Meat (as above)\n * Blubber\n * Skin\n* Laver/Irish Moss/other seaweeds\n* Birds\n * Meat\n * Eggs\n * Bones (stock)\n* Fish\n * Meat (as above, also fermented)\n * Bones (stock)\n* Polar Bear\n * Meat (as above)\n\nThen, maybe they have herd animals (even if they don't sow seeds) and we can expect there to be lichen (for the reindeer) but any other thin patches of grasses or root vegetables would support these as long as they were highly mobile:\n\n* Goat\n * Meat (as above)\n * Milk (as above)\n * Bones\n* Boar\n * Meat\n * Bones\n\nThen lastly the two assumptions are that Sejuani's tribe TAKE what they want from the border villages (much in the way the Wildlings in Game of Thrones do) and then we have the added wildcard of there being legitimate Seers and other magic users who could help identify other food sources and/or mitigate hunger.\n\n_(Standard disclaimer - I'm only as well informed as any player here - I don't have secret Riot narrative team knowledge on this, as I am not part of that team.)_","replies":[{"poster":"Sneak Dog","date":"2015-06-22T00:55:07.833+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":0,"body":">Polar Bear\n\n >   Meat (as above)\n\n{{champion:106}} Ursine disapproves","replies":[]},{"poster":"ElJanitorFrank","date":"2015-06-22T03:50:15.429+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't forget the...well...\n\nthe {{summoner:31}} .\n\nI know, I know, hang me if you must, but a N*gga gotta eat.","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2015-06-22T04:50:41.570+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ElJanitorFrank,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=QW8bwE2g,comment-id=00050002,timestamp=2015-06-22T03:50:15.429+0000)\n>\n> Don't forget the...well...\n> \n> the {{summoner:31}} .\n> \n> I know, I know, hang me if you must, but a N*gga gotta eat.\n\nOh you're quite right.

Now, the 9-snax poro looks to be almost half as big as Sejuani's giant boar, which I imagine makes for some good eatin' - especially if to get it to that size, all you need to do are feed it 9 Avarosan game hen meat biscuits.\n\nAnd then, of course, there's the poro King...","replies":[{"poster":"Solideus","date":"2015-06-22T15:38:56.822+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"In many ways Poros don't seem...natural.

I'm suggesting that if you raid an Avarosan village or 12, you can butcher their hens and turn them into easy to transport poro snax.

If I recall properly (I read about this a long time ago), some of them herd wild reindeer, but the herds are treated as more of a natural resource to be tracked and protected rather than a case of developed animal husbandry.  From what I know about them, they do occasionally have inter-tribal skirmishes but never on a very large scale due to small population sizes and isolation even between their own tribes.  \n\nAh, found a Wikipedia page on one (Evenks) of the North-East Siberian native groups:\n\"Traditionally they were a mixture of pastoralists and hunter-gatherers—they relied on their domesticated reindeer for milk and transport and hunted other large game for meat (Vasilevich, 620-1).\"\n\n\"The traditional Evenki economy was a mix of pastoralism (of horses or reindeer), fishing, and hunting. The Evenki who lived near the Okhotsk Sea hunted seal, but for most of the taiga-dwellers, elk, wild reindeer, and fowl were the most important game animals. Other animals included “roe deer, bear, wolverine, lynx, wolf, Siberian marmot, fox, and sable” (Vasilevich, 626). Trapping did not become important until the imposition of the fur tax by the tsarist government.\"\n\nI don't see any references to their warfare, but I recall seeing a picture of their battle equipment a while back - which was composed of mostly padded clothing and a large triangular wooden/leather \"shield\" piece across the shoulders.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Matezoide","date":"2015-06-24T03:56:43.168+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sejuani is just a crappy leader with no plans for the future.
