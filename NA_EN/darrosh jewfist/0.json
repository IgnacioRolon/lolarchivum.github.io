The price isn't so bad in the 5 dollar range with 4 issues (20 dollars total) and I wanted to support it and see it. The actual comic itself is about 22-ish pages with the rest being sketches, glossary. Oh and thank god for a glossary, holy crap. We have definitions now and new terms.\n\n**Synopsis:**\nAshe's tribe is weak and poor after years of leadership by her insane/delusional mom, Grena, who thinks she can find the Throne of Avarosa (which is treated like a children's fairy tale and filled with riches). They introduced some new characters besides Grena.\n\n**Aunt Helnr**, who challenges Ashe's mom for leadership and loses but survives. She leads the Hearthbound (or warmbloods) who are the normies. Iceborn are part-genetic, part-trained, and become iceborn when they win a game of super-cold-potato with some true ice.\n\n**Maalcrom**, a frost-priest who Ashe might have a thing for. Frost-priests are healers but also implied spy agents of Lissandra?\n\n**Yrael**, Ashe's maybe father (because warmothers practice polygamy so who knows who Ashe's real father is?). He's oathbound and bloodsworn which are pretty much the same thing. He's typical cool old guy who has a fanatical loyalty to Grena.\n\nAfter some introductions, Ashe's mom decides to raid a village only to end up getting ambushed themselves. Ashe's mom realizes she dun goof'd and tells Ashe to run. Then the issue ends with NEXT ISSUE: DRAKLORN (Draklorn are Lissandra's cult inquisition).\n\n**My Thoughts**\nI really liked it. One major nitpick I have with a lot of League of Legends short stories is that they tend to be extremely adjective heavy. Comics are neat in that pictures convey a lot more of the story then dialogue alone and saves a boatload on word count. The dialogue itself is well written, mostly because Ashe's internal narration to explain context/definitions/etc... helped trim it so it was much more focused. I liked how everything felt natural and despite the short page count, there was a lot shoved into it (like the oathfathers agree'ing to give up their last rations to Ashe because she's their daughter and they're all joking/smiling about it - either they're trying to not make her feel bad/guilty or they're glad to see their kid eat). I felt it was much better executed in a visual medium than it would in text like...\n\n>My oathfathers handed me a bowl of disgusting gruel. We had been marching for 6 days and nights. We were burning our last portion of firewood. They sat around it, staring at the crackling embers full of smiles. When that old-guy that may or may not be my step dad told me it was the last of our food, I spilled some on accident. I felt really bad. Hey, is my mother still insane? Yes. Yes she is.\n\nThe art is divine. 5/5 stars full stop.\n\n**Predictions**\nI think the story is heading in a pretty neat direction as an elaborated Ashe origin. I imagine the next issue will show Ashe's mom dying (as per the Universe bio on Ashe so.... spoilers for a spoiler?) and the other issues will eventually have her either finding Avarosa's Throne or making up a fake one like Swain implied. I wouldn't be surprised if Ashe has survivor's guilt because it seems like she's going to abandon her mom to get out of the ambush.\n\nI feel this is a very strong direction for League to take with regards to expanding its lore. \n\n**Bonus here are the glossary terms (please don't ban me Riot, I'll remove this part if asked)**\n\n* Warmother - The military leader of a Freljordian Tribe or clan, always a woman and usually an iceborn. She decides when to fight, who to fight, and who will die.\n\n* Iceborn - A person born with the ancestral ice magic of the Freljord, possessing greater stamina, strength, and resistance to cold than most humans. Iceborn have the potential to use ice magic and wield true ice. A person is not typically called an iceborn until they have proven their ability to wield true ice and have been \"named\" following a duel or battle. Until then, they are often described as the daughter or son of an iceborn.\n\n* True Ice - Innately magical ice that enhances ice magic. It is colder than any other known substance and lethal for any but the strongest iceborn to touch.\n\n* Bloodsworn - The sworn \"husbands\" of a warmother, usually the toughest warriors in the tribe. Their loyalty is to her and her children above all else.\n\n* Oathfather - Interchangeably describes a father or step-father, roles Freljordians do not typically distinguish between. Any man who has sworn his life to protect a mother and her children is considered an oathfather.\n\n* Ice Children - A mountain tribe with a long standing rivalry against Ashe's tribe.\n\n* Hearthbound - Human inhabitants of the Freljord, unable to survive the same extremes as the iceborn, they take up the majority of the population, the term is sometimes used by iceborn as a slur or insult.\n\n* Warmblood - A casual term used by iceborn to describe normal humans. It is synonymous with hearthbound, but has no negative connotation.\n\n* Frost Priest - A healer and follower of Lissandra who serves and monitors the tribes on her behalf.\n\n* Draklorn - High-ranking Frost Priests, often assigned to regional villages as sources of social and religious authority.\n\n* Vedmah - A freljordian oracle or with who divines through magical means\n\n* Elnuk - shaggy buffalo-like creature with long curved tusks, used ofr riding, cattle, and as currency by many tribes.\n\nAlso quick question - Does anyone know what the hell IS the name of Ashe's tribe? I don't think it's mentioned unless it's still Avarosan, which I thought was the name of the tribe after Ashe renames them.","replies":[{"poster":"WAAARGHbobo","date":"2018-12-19T16:59:37.703+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Vedmah - A freljordian oracle or _**witch**_ who divines through magical means.    Somehow a typo sneaked thru on comixology.   \"witch\" not \"with.\"   \nA lot of thought was given to not overwhelming the reader with a bunch of in-world terms, but instead slowly introducing them organically.    So each issue will expand the glossary as terms, places, and concepts are added.   \n\n\nRe: Oathfather vs Bloodsword.     Difference is between \"father\" and \"husband.\"    I.e. Grena's Bloodsword, are Ashe's Oathfathers.","replies":[{"poster":"Darrosh Jewfist","date":"2018-12-19T17:13:11.105+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I felt the terms in the comic were introduced very organically. None felt really forced and the slow trickle of worldbuilding as it becomes relevant with scenes to connect them made the terms stick much more strongly than they do in a lot of short stories were they're just thrown in (like sump snipe or drakehounds or the myriad of terms that aren't followed up). Each new term was relevant to the world immediately instead of thrown away to fluff up the world and it made the comic so much more enjoyable.\n\nAnother thing I feel works greatly in this comic's favor compared to some of the previous comics is that there's a stronger plot. Ashe wants something and there are forces stopping her. Other comics, like Darius/Nami/Ziggs and Jinx is that they just sort of... told something happened. The art is great in all of them but the story they were telling wasn't as focused as this is. \n\nThis comic has given me hope that League's lore can be great, or at least as popular as it was in the pre-Retcon days.\n\n**EDIT QUESTION:** What is the name of Ashe's tribe in the comic?

Most of our marriage customs are about transfer of property.  But in the freljord marriage is based on complicated family obligations-- particularly protecting children from the harsh environment.  and the hopes of having more magically gifted children.  It's also polygamous society with very distinct gender roles which is thus reflected in it culture and language. \n  \n_**Oathbound**_ is someone held by an oath they have publicly given.   This can cover a wide swath of oaths, from promising loyalty, to swearing revenge, etc...  Basically you are publicly stating honoring this oath is more important than my own life. \n\n_**Bloodsworn**_ is a husband.   It is an oath to protect and value (above your own life) another person and their children.  It is used exclusively for members of the opposite sex-- and generally is only used to describe husbands-- i.e. men.  So making a child with someone not bloodsworn to you is a huge taboo.   Though it is not uncommon for Bloodsworn to have purely non-sexual relationships with the person they are oathbound to, effectively it is the \"right\" to mate with someone and a statement that this person's lineage is worthy and important to the tribe. \n \nA man becomes a Bloodsworn by giving an oath to a woman (to protect her and more importantly her children)  so it is a particular type of Oathbound promise.   Note: a man could effectively be bloodsworn to more than one women.  It's common for a warmother to take a man as bloodsworn who is already bloodsworn to another woman (or women)-- usually by also adopting the other woman as a Bloodkin. (And thus also adopting the couples previous children as her own).    Indirectly a man bloodsworn to a tribe's warmother-- becomes much more desirable to other women-- as because a relationship with him now means a direct political connection to the tribe's leader-- for yourself and your children.\n\n**_Bloodkin_** is a similar term to bloodsworn and has a similar meaning but it is for members of the same sex.  (Generally it is only used between women --but men might also describe other men as bloodkin.)  Bloodkin are oathbound to protect each other and each other's children in the same manner as Bloodsworn but it also assumes 1. that you are taking this person a retainer and 2. you will assign them some sort of command duties.  Generally it implies sister-hood.  \n\n_**Oathfather**_ is a similar term to Bloodsworn-- but from the perspective of a child vs wife, and implies that relationship and responsibilities.    i.e. Grena's Bloodsworn is Ashe's Oathfather.","replies":[{"poster":"Nylisa","date":"2018-12-19T20:33:28.855+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":" That.... is a heavy chunk of information right there.thank you. \n\nThis however raises one more question for me, can a bloodsworn/bloodkin be choosen by Warmother purely for platonic and romantic reasons or this has to be in interest of the tribe and protection? \n\ni'm gonna pin this answer to my bookmarks cause its gonna come up a lot in the future!

(You are actually pledging your life and it is likely in the harsh freljord this can/will get you killed at some point.)   \n\nFor a normal person in the Freljord, the choice is probably just about love and opportunity.  (A man might give an oath to one woman when he was young and in love-- and then late he gives an oath to a Warmother or powerful Scarthane later-- because that \"marriage\" will elevate his children and wife to a position that is more secure and protected.)  \n\nFor a warmother, it would be foolish to take an oath from someone simply because you love them-- which is why most bloodsworn are the best warriors in the tribe.  And why the term is used generically to describe them rather than regular joes who got married.  (i.e. if I say \"he is a bloodsworn\"  I am implying that he is the bloodsworn of the warmother and one of the best warriors in the tribe.  If he is not from that rare group, a freljordian would instead say. \"He oathbound to Vauna\" -or- \"He is the bloodsworn of Battlemaiden Vauna.\"  (The second example clarifies to the listener, he is a bloodsworn but to someone below the Warmother in rank.)","replies":[{"poster":"Chromatic Eagle","date":"2018-12-19T22:57:36.011+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What's a Scarthane?","replies":[{"poster":"WAAARGHbobo","date":"2018-12-19T23:18:24.451+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"A proven war leader.

Wow, really turning up the heat in regards to the lore. Just responding to Darrosh, some things I want to add/comment on regarding thoughts on lore:\n\nOverall Thoughts: They story reminds me a bit of Banner Saga, since they both heavily pull from Norse mythos, it seems like the approach here. Nothing else to add really, its neat. \n\n* Maalcrom: I think he's her cousin, actually. When Yrael was talking to her before they left, he mentioned that it wasn't her cousing destiny to lead, but hers. The only person we can think to reference is Maalcrom, since...I mean...there are only like...less than 5 named people. He has to be one of them. \n\n* Yrael: totally ashes baby daddy. It seems like warmothers are like jarls/warlords. It wouldn't be out of the realm of imagination for someone as powerful as her to have male consorts, like a khan or something. And, it does say outright that he's her father during the \"Thrice honored and thrice blessed..\" part. She had siblings too, but they didn't make it. \n\nIce-children: I think, just supposition, that this is Sejuani's clan? I mean, they are riding monster things with sharp horns, and when they spring the ambush it kinda looks like one of Sej's skin sets. \n\nOathfather: I agree with ya, but want to add, that an oathfather is a consort :D! They might actually be your oathfather and biological father (like Yrael to Ashe) at the same time :O! \n\nBloodsworn: I think these aren't husbands, but just warriors. This is common in warring bands (vikings, plains riders, etc.) and all seem to be Iceborn. Some could also be consorts to the leader, if they are oathfathers, but it seems not all oathfathers=warrior/bloodsworn.\n\nThe rest was just filler until they start developing the story more. I like the ideas they introduced, though. Of the Khan's Plateau (could that means a plains people, maybe Thalia's peeps Her garbs would match) They threw in Lissandra, cults and some other stuff which seems neat.","replies":[]}]}
