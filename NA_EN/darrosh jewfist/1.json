I can dig that. But -uh- vengeance for what? Oh, she&#039;s an aglamation of countless spirits with their own personal vendettas? Guess she&#039;s just mad all the time...\n{{champion:150}} - cute little Freljord yordle who wakes up. What the hell does he want? Food? Okay sure... that&#039;s it? Boring.\n{{champion:421}} - maybe Rek&#039;Sai gets a pass because she&#039;s a beast but I don&#039;t really feel any sympathy for a animal who&#039;s territorial - is she protecting her young? Her young who, far from being defenseless, are being hunted to participate in gladiatorial duels? I&#039;m not saying that non-speaking beasts can&#039;t convey a lot of sympathy and emotion (POKEMON DOES IT!) but the way it was approached here makes it hard to feel any sort of relation to Rek&#039;Sai other than &#039;wuuuagh! I&#039;m big and bad!&#039;\n{{champion:245}} - His friend dies and somehow he has a lot of Zaun pride? I&#039;m not really WHAT his motivation is other than to protect his friend&#039;s grave - which is a relatively weak motivation. Does he want to rid the world of bad people? Spread Zaun ideological to the four corners of Runeterra?\nHell if I know. I don&#039;t know the guy and he seems he could be pretty relatable.\n{{champion:223}} - Tahm is actually the most clear in his motivation: he wants to eat. I can get behind that. Apparently he&#039;s getting more lore incoming with the Bilgewater update so we&#039;ll see if this motivation evolves into something more than making the best out of a buffet ticket.\n\nYou know, when the Narrative&#039;s former lead says this:\n\n>\"Plot is highly overrated. Users don&#039;t remember plot; what they do remember is they remember characters. Focus on the things that they will retain, that are going to be most important to them in the long-run. Focus on character.\" - Tom Abernathy.\n\nThere&#039;s an expectations that even if the story you might want to tell is bland/or hell, in this case UTTERLY NONEXISTENT - then at the very least the character motivations should be fleshed out right? That these characters aren&#039;t defined by their appearances or gimmicks or tropes but rather the struggles they carry, the emotion that can be easily related to the viewer in a compelling fashion?","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2015-07-15T16:19:09.108+0000","up_votes":35,"down_votes":5,"body":"I actually found Tahm Kench to be an interesting window into the motivations of many of the other champions - he is, after all, looking to trade for their deepest desires.

Hopefully the Bildgewater event changes that then we'll be a step in the right direction.

You can certainly use her in stories and build upon her as a legend, but until you move beyond that aspect of her and delve into the past to explore her former life and place in the fall of the Isles you really haven't got a whole lot to go on. At present she's an interesting piece of the world but not terribly interesting in her own right.\n\nWhen a character is introduced with the same story in three different mediums (bio, short story and cinematic) it really gives the impression that there isn't much more to say about them than \"Kalista is a vengeful spirit who can be summoned to hunt traitors at the cost of your soul,\" and that was profoundly disappointing after so much of the discussion before her release had revolved around her past in the Isles. She really needs a chapter two to make her more than just a force of nature, particularly considering just how much scope there is to tell a very interesting story with her and the other denizens of the Shadow Isles.","replies":[{"poster":"Doctor Ivellius","date":"2015-07-15T20:06:07.986+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even better, the short story and the video show two different ways of summoning her--one through a ritual, one through just asking for vengeance as your life expires.

In many stories with Gods and such, the best ones are those with human characteristics. The gods in pantheons (Greek, Roman, Warhammer 40K, Japan, The Sillmarillion etc) tend to be reflections of human (and others) feelings and concerns. They have their own dramas and such. Beings like Bard and (from a purely narrative perspective without any religious commentary) the Judeo-Christian-Islamic God are boring because we can't understand them. They work in mysterious ways and are aloof from motives and therefore do whatever the author wants without reference to rules. \n\nAs an example of how to do it better: In the comics Sandman and Lucifer (two my favourites) the God and Devil (and Death and lord of dreams) of the DC universe were anthropomorphized and given desires, conflicts and limitations on their powers. This made them far more interesting than 'God is good and such, the Devil is bad and such.' They had arcs and changed and could communicate in means we could understand (not just in lovely sounding notes). Even though it wasn't Biblically accurate, they were much better as members of a story than their staid versions of before. Even within the Abrahamic texts (again, from a pure story perspective) people like Moses, Jesus and Mohammed are far more interesting to read about because we can identify with them better than a distant and mysterious deity. Phew. Sorry about the wall of text.","replies":[{"poster":"Legacy of Xion","date":"2015-07-16T02:26:17.535+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You.

(Which is why I don't agree with Riot's decisions regarding Retcon, etc.) _Character development!_ All of the other champs you mentioned, even if we don't understand them, want _something._ Once they acquire it, a good author isn't going to say \"And now they have the McGuffin, and everyone lived happily ever after the end.\" That's a children's bedtime story ending, not literature. A good author is going to explore the consequences of acquiring the McGuffin, why it isn't what they thought it was, or why it doesn't solve their problems, or why it's everything they ever wanted but now sitting on their ass at work browsing boards all the time isn't actually fulfilling in any way shape or form. (Goddamn I'm bored today.)\nThe story ends when the author ends it. Until then, there will always be conflict. Hell, even after the story ends there will be conflict, that's where sequels _came_ from. But saying the story ends when they get what they want is just laziness on the author's part. \nCase in point - Old Trundle. He was at the league, he had decided he wasn't going to help his people anymore, he was in it for him. End of story, right? Wrong. He's still at the institute. Why? He's happy, isn't he? Fulfilled, smacking things with a club, fighting 'round the world? Ok. So he'll never have an existential crisis? Never decide he wants to try Poro steak? Never do anything ever again, even at the speed of Riot Lore? He'll never meet Lissandra at the League and decide \"Hey, maybe here's someone who can sympathize, maybe I'll talk to her, move to the freljord on my own **instead of suddenly having been there all along**?\"\nAuthors have creative freedom, with only two limits - what they can justify without breaking suspension of disbelief, and what they can express through language. Saying \"it was too hard.\" is a crock.","replies":[{"poster":"GreenLore","date":"2015-07-15T18:54:55.381+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Yeah,there are ways to create new and different conflicts,but they can be hard to pull off,if the character has been defined by this one conflict for years.\n\nNot to mention that some things the champions seek would remove an essential part of their characters(or other characters if they want to kill them).\nI mean what if ahri finally becomes human?It would be confusing if suddenly theres a hole bunch of stories about human ahri.\nWhat about Xerath once he is free?That would shake up too many things to keep that change.\nWhat if Malzahar manages to end the world by leading the void into runeterra?Thats pretty much game over for 90% of all champions.\n\nI think some goals are too much of an endgame to be ever archieved without being the final chapter for a character(in some cases it is rather unlikely that they'll ever achieve their goal at all).\n\nOverall I agree that their stories don't have to end once they achieve their goal,but their primary story arc definetly ends there(unless there is some sort of problem once they aquire said mcguffin),which requires setting up a completely new story,so it is more difficult to work with a story like that in the long run.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"NorthernDruid","date":"2015-07-16T02:22:35.160+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I feel like the biggest problem with the new upcoming game-unrelated stories, is that there's nothing to be motivated for in the setting.\n\nIf there even is a setting.\n\nNot even for the characters but for the players. There's no setting to be motivated for, no continous story, nothing to drive a narrative forward on the continental scale that they need to replace (should've replaced ASAP back when they were announcing the upcoming replacement which is still nowhere to be seen).\n\nSo Ekko lost his friend, boo hoo, that story seemed interesting while all we had to go on was the video but then all the interesting bits got disproven and Ekko was revealed to be a really cool character with no plot, and so no motivation to follow him.\n\nBard... is... cool. A really great character wasted on a seting which isn't centered around him and with no ongoing narrative to interact with.\n\nKalista at least has hints as to her backstory and deep setting ties. It would be great if there was anything more than that but at least she's got ties to something and it's clear that even though she's this multisouled creature thing spirit, she has a moral of some kind, she has sentience, identity and some form of agenda, even if that agenda is on hold until something relevant happens.\n\nRek'Sai is uninteresting in much the same way Bard is because she's just... not someone you can get any amount of insight into. She's a land shark, and that's it. And I hope they drag their feet a loooong time before morphing Skarner into the same kind of creature. She's a non-character, as far as I can tell, and non-characters don't make for good stories.\n\nAs for Tahm... I like Tahm, he's got a story, even if it's just the one. You can tell what he's about and how he goes about it. He's got a personality, an agenda (even if we have no clear indication to what), and he has a story. Not just the one story they told about him. He's got a story because he's a predator, and not just a random land shark who eats desert people, he's a hunter, a social hunter, and you don't really see that kind of character a lot. You can really see him offer up a bargain to another Champion and try and trick them into it. Just think about Ezreal for instance, Ezreal is fine with using what is essentially a cursed item as long as the power is worth the tradeoff of being randomly enlisted to fight on the Fields of Justice, imagine what Two-coats can bargain out of him. \n\nThere's plenty of those hidden depths Tahm can dig out of other champions, because desires, greed and gluttony is something very basic that you rarely find anyone without.\n\nAnd I think that's really what makes a great character. It's not just about being an awesome concept, it's not about being so good you can survive without a strong plot, it's about not needing a plot because what you bring out in contact with other characters is bound to be a decent plot in itself. And when two characters meet who both bring out a decent plot in each other, you've got a good plot. And then, when those characters synch up well in what they bring out of each other, you've got a great plot. And when you also have that backed up a by a compelling story around it all, a setting if you will, then you've got a great story.\n\nBut no matter how cool the setting, no matter how cool the characters, it's not a worthwhile story if the characters never meet and interact, if the world doesn't move the characters and the characters doesn't move the world, then it's not a story, it's a pretty picture. And pictures can be pretty, and they can even be used to tell stories, but they aren't stories in and of themselves.\n\nIf Riot wants to really tell stories, they need to show us what happens when all these charcters interact. And they need to make room for that interaction, 'cause they removed the driving factor in making interactions happen in their setting, and then left it there.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Narog","date":"2015-07-15T21:09:59.313+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"MAny of the resent champions are one dimensional have one emotion and some dont have any personality , they look like NPCs that you shoot or like a Seller .","replies":[]},{"poster":"CaptainMårvelous","date":"2015-07-15T20:10:11.642+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'll disagree and/or agree with some of these!\n\n{{champion:432}} - Pretty clear motivation. He is in charge of cosmic balance...but what does cosmic balance entail? See, I think that's where things fell apart. We saw Bard grab an orb and put it on the mountain but nothing else. The best thing one could do with bard's character is place him in morally ambiguous situations and show that what he's doing is for the good of all, NOT the good or perhaps even morally right thing.\n\n{{champion:201}} - Totally agree. Although he always struck me as a larger-than-life hero in fairy tales who's motivation is \"Hey I'm the hero so I gotta do the right thing\"\n\n{{champion:429}} - \"We are legion. We are vengeance\". To be honest I feel Kalista works better as a concept/god-level force than an actual character. She's vengeance incarnate. You can't really put a face to it.

Needs emphasis.\n\n{{champion:421}} - Think you kinda nailed the concept. She's a monster. Her goals are eat/hunt/mate/kill. I find her more like a shark: You don't usually feel sympathy for sharks, you see them as awe-inspiring and terror.\n\n{{champion:245}} - Here is where I'ma go 100% against you, because I feel Ekko has a total motive and the one you transcribed to him doesn't do justice. Simply put, Ekko wants to be proud of Zaun. He wants his city to be a shining beacon of technology and progress like Piltover is. The problem is that Piltover looks down on him so much (Giving him ire) while Zaun itself is corrupt and a mess. The culmination on why Ekko has no clear goal on what to do is that he's young. He's 14-18 and has no clue how to make Zaun better. He lashes out at others because he doesn't know what to do. \n\n  Furthermore, Ekko's unclear path where to go frustrates him. He sees his friend die...what now? All he can do is enact revenge. Nothing gets done and Ekko feels helpless because he's forced to go back, fix his invention and try to find a place to go from there. At his core, Ekko is the man who wants to do good but does not know where to go. Whether he'll fall to the wayside and side with the wrong crowd (Jinx) or if he'll find a rightous path where he can make Zaun the shining utopia he KNOWS it can be is where the character can evolve. The groundwork is there, we just need to see where it'll go.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Teemoto","date":"2015-07-16T04:58:24.106+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"rammus: ok","replies":[]},{"poster":"Centuros","date":"2015-07-15T23:33:01.032+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Ekko wants to reform Zaun, get rid of the Bad Things that happen there.\nHe... just isn't quite sure how yet, since he's only a kid.
