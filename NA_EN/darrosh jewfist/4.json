I have some bad news for you in that such a thing as mighty as a 'capital' was wiped from knowledge of the Shuriman people, when the empire fell.

It occupies the South of the desert 'empire' reaching from the endless mountain range, almost half way to where the city Shurima was (and they say, is again).  Coming from the Freljord as you are, I would say that should you find yourself on a parallel with that place - venture no further South.  It is weeks of the most hateful travel.\n\nSorry it is not happier news - there are still amazing prizes to be gathered for the courageous (and well prepared) merchant traveler in the stalls (and under the cloaks) of this brutal land.

This, I believe, was a stylistic choice that [many ancient people used](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylonian_Map_of_the_World) - long before realistic maps and realistic scales were used.  As such, the map is at least slightly symbolic.\n\nNote too, the symbols around the edges.  On the left, what looks like the sun is drawn behind a mountain.  At the top of the picture, another sun is drawn - this time, above the mountain range.  Our image is missing what might have been shown on the right, but I have it on quite good authority that there would be another sun picture there.  It would probably have been drawn behind another mountain or range of hills.\n\nIn Shurima, as any visitor knows, the sun rises in the East, sweeps high across the sky on the North side, and then sets in the West.  If we take these symbols to represent dawn, noon, and the missing setting sun, then the drawing is orientated with North at the top.\n\nI hope that helps with the beginnings of your studies.

Unfortunately, I don't have any information about Summoners (except for the publically known fact that there are no longer Summoners) - I'm not part of the lore or narrative team.  I am here because I helped make the Shurima map for the Rek'Sai teaser site, and they say I'm allowed to answer questions on it.  Bigger questions - I'm as in the dark as you are, most likely!\n> \n> Sorry again.  I don't even usually work directly on League!\n\nThanks! No problem, I just wondered why; good to know I wasn't skipped over on purpose xD.\n\nJeddy017's comment above (chronological view please hehe) actually speaks to the contrary (which' what I meant to allude to)...\n\n**Summoners do exist still, it's just not widely known (popularly).**\n\nHaha, you can see this in the fact you didn't even know xD (just poking good-natured fun at you :P).\n\n**So do you think you'd wanna speak to Narrative & ask them to give us a teaser as to their current or new dominion/realm of existence in (or outside, ho ho!) Runeterra???**\n\nAlso (sorry to derail a little here but Quinn fans are especially desperate for communication/help), if you speak to IronStylus (or could, please!), do you think you could please ask him to visit by at *this thread*:\n\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/p0vFP3c2-ironstylus-regarding-quinn\n\nOr someone more appropriate to the requests/questions if not him :)\n\n**I would love you forever! I'm completely disheartened... I've fought so hard for two years for *this and more* with virtually nothing to show.**\n\nThank you so much for any consideration!\n\nP.S. Aside-tangent... I wonder if a lot of players feel neglected by Red's as a result of \"Discussion-View Syndrome.\" Not saying I do, you found me after all & I'm happy for it :). But you know about all these threads hating on the new Forums (please nobody derail this thread with talk of that, this' merely an aside I want left behind)... I almost feel like Rioter's should use Chronological View as a standard when looking to respond in discussion threads. I feel like people may feel 'burnt' often as they get accidentally bypassed due to the comment-sorting, *that* may alleviate this *syndrome* I just invented. What do you think? I think it'd be good for community health/PR if I'm understanding the system right. It's just my impression that commenter's get incidentally skipped quite often & it can be hurtful/negative for the community. /tangent-over #thankyouforlistening\n","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2015-03-08T01:17:27.591+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, Eyrgos!\n\nYeah - see, this is why I try to keep out of discussions on the other lore elements.  \n{{item:3070}} \n\nI honestly don't know what I'm talking about, and in the instance where someone from Narrative says something that what I say doesn't agree with (or even doesn't imply the same thing) you should *absolutely ignore every word from my keyboard*.

I really don't think you can comprehend the gravitas of just how much this means to me.\n\nMy only worry (and you may want to forward this to old Styly too as it appears urgently important he know it, given his intentions to move forward it sounds like) is that they've already cooked up a concept without speaking to us... now, I trust IronStylus as a designer, but because of the way Quinn's been handled historically & my perception of a 'damaged relationship' between Riot & Quinn fans, which needs mending in my opinion... I think it might be best if they officially seek us out for feedback/thoughts first (before running with their idea). If anything, I think that would be a huge step in creating 'healing' with regards to the strained relationship. That'll be moot though so long as they're flexible with regards to making major adjustments to the design if fans are widely displeased. I just think involving us may make for a solid 'olive branch', if you will. Food for thought, something worth his consideration if you think you'd wanna forward this last point on my behalf.\n\nYou've already gone above & beyond, I appreciate you so much. It's no bother if you don't wish to do this last little thing; you've already done something incredible for us which you really shouldn't have (nor of this thread, sorry again to all about the derail; it ends here, whether replied to or not. Promise.).\n\nAs promised above, I'll let this communication die here & await IronStylus' next move. Love you long time (saving forever-love for the fam), I'll never forget this :)\n\nSincerely,\n\nEyrgos\n\nP.S. if you do happen to reach out to him once more (humbly), please do be sure to extend my personal thanks for the potential 'bumping up the list' of Quinn's visual changes.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ULTRAF0RCE","date":"2015-03-08T01:51:53.923+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"the problem with chronological view is that it is near impossible for people not used to these forums to know who is responding to who in them(main reason I avoid GD) also by seeing what comments are actually creating discussion inside the thread easier it makes it more simple for the players from Riot to decide which question they will answer, since if you notice with the exceptions on the light hearted threads most red responses are easy to tell apart partially because you can tell they have been worked on in a way to try and give a clear explanation to whatever it is they are discussing.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Motajo","date":"2015-03-08T05:23:32.433+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Bioluminescence,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=LxEbBEWH,comment-id=000b0000,timestamp=2015-03-08T00:08:05.501+0000)**EDIT** - As Jeddy017 pointed out, and Eyrgos confirmed - I do not know what I'm talking about.  This is the Jaredan quote that's important here:\n\nEven if Summoners are technically still a part of Runeterra, doesn't changing them render the point moot?\n\nI mean, since they're getting changed, they clearly won't fill the same purposes they did before the Great Retcon.
