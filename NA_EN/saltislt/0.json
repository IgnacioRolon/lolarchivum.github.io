Those other games mattered more, and in this case the system just may have caught you one game sooner than it would have otherwise. There's not some \"special number\" of toxic games you get -- it's just how long it takes the system to confirm your behavior.\n\nSo the ban isn't for playing a champ for the 1st time -- it's for accumulating a percentage of valid games reported that you were RIGHT on the tipping point of a ban, and then that last report making the system recheck your account's standing. You were banned entirely for your other behavior.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"This Is Your Dad","date":"2017-06-02T19:38:43.750+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Was it this game or the other game before this that triggered the ban?

My intention was to play Ivern because I didn't believe Nunu will carry us therefore I would try out new champ (which I was 100% correct), not because i wanted to lose.  Look, I am leveling this account, ok ? Why would i try to lose intentionally. This even wouldn't make sense.\nNote: Before the game never accused, flamed or otherwise made nunu to think i have something against him.
