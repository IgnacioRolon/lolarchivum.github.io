With the volume of toxic players and AFK&#039;s it is unfair to leave promotions entirely to game wins and not consider the skill level of individual players.","replies":[{"poster":"Nea104","date":"2017-09-10T02:13:58.025+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=KiloEightFour,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Rllt6NaL,comment-id=,timestamp=2017-09-03T06:21:23.536+0000)\n>\n> I feel like whatever penalties LoL uses to punish people for AFK, Toxic Reports etc is not effective because the amount of people going AFK, Trolling, Grieving etc seems to be much higher on LoL than competitor MOBA&amp;#039;s.\n>\n\nI agree.
