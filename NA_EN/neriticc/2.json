Notice how I said strong and not broken, because it just deals max hp damage and gives some movement speed, that’s it. But because it is hard to proc the passive that’s the problem.\r\n\r\nHis Q deals pretty much 0 damage in the late game with a ridiculously long CD at all stages of the game.\r\n\r\nHis W is fair enough. Shielding + heal similar to Tahm Kench.\r\n\r\nHis E is like a shit version of Darius E. Darius E will pull targets hit. Morde’s E does whatever is feels like.\r\n\r\nHis R can just be countered by a QSS costing 1300g and since he is a magic damage dealer, QSS is even better against Morde.\r\n\r\nIf Morde didn’t have his passive, this champion would be a laughing joke.","replies":[{"poster":"Chembaron Yamada","date":"2019-06-24T16:22:43.866+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mordekaiser's passive is hard to proc?

With CDR, you can bring this even down to 2.4 seconds.
