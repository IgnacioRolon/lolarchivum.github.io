In my opinion, Vayne is 3x more broken than Kai’sa is. At least Kai’sa has no CC and needs items for stealth, meanwhile balanced champ Vayne gets this for free at level 6. At least Kai’sa passive deals magic damage instead of true damage.","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-11-13T10:28:20.239+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Vayne has CC, Kai'Sa has poke.
