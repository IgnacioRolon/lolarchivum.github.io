The legacy and updated clients use the same files, so if it won't work on one then it likely will be the same for the other.  In this case you may need a [reinstall ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202539040-Reinstalling-League-of-Legends)without upgrading, until a resolution is found.","replies":[{"poster":"PinkWardMyShroud","date":"2016-11-22T21:41:49.823+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Omfggggg!!
