I think that was changed a while ago, though!  I just tested this out with a friend, and everything looks fine.  He was still in my friends list!  If you are able to reproduce this, let our QA team know about it on the [Bug Boards](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report)!  Thanks for the heads up.","replies":[{"poster":"Valiseer","date":"2016-10-15T23:10:43.215+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It was through a full game on summoners rift.
