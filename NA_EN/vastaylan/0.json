I usually keep the basic one because I find there to be often not enough wards placed on the map but I know my team is at a disadvantage if we dont have a sweeper or farsight can you give me advice on this?\r\nAnd I tend to like Assasins or Bruisers and im attracted to melee hyper carrys if you have any recommendations let me know please.\r\nAnyways I just figured I would give a quick rundown can I get some advice before I hop into ranked?","replies":[{"poster":"AfterTheFall","date":"2017-06-26T14:12:05.683+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pick two roles and try to stick to them. Be able to play at least 2 champs in EVERY role at a decent level incase of autofill. Play with a small champion pool and get good with them. Trinket depends on the game. If the enemy team has traps or invisible champs then get a sweeper. Adc's and mages are best with a blue orb so they dont have to face-check bushes. Assassins are best with a sweeper so you can clear any enemy vision on your way to gank. That way they dont see you coming. When it comes to map awareness, its huge. You HAVE to know whats going on around the map, so you know how to react to it. Ranked is a whole different ball game. You'll learn what i mean pretty quick off the bat. DO NOT die 3+ times during laning phase. There is absolutely no excuse for that. If you die once or twice then play safe and farm under tower to gain xp. Ppl have really tough time understanding that concept. Playing safe is something very few ppl understand. If you can grasp how to do it and when you need to, you have a leg up on everyone.","replies":[{"poster":"Vastaylan","date":"2017-06-26T14:15:49.032+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for your advice","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Mysticman89","date":"2017-06-26T14:10:00.046+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't be discouraged if it starts off rough. It's always a somewhat sobering experience when you first ranked, since people tend to think they're at least 'ok' even if they're not great, and then end up somewhere in bronze and get either frustrated with themselves and conclude they weren't ready, or more often frustrated with their teammates and don't actually improve.\n\nRanked probably is the best place to improve your skills (not to learn champs, but more broadly improve), since people tend to play off-role in norms or unfamiliar champs, and in general not necessarily try as hard. Ranked by contrast people are usually all on their best champs and best roles and are keen to win, so it can be a rough transition. Keep at it though, and you'll climb up from wherever you might land at first, the key is to not get discouraged and always focus on looking for things you could have done differently.","replies":[{"poster":"Vastaylan","date":"2017-06-26T14:17:22.809+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for the advice","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Fuh Queue","date":"2017-06-26T13:37:33.567+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Make sure you sacrifice a goat and prepare the blood of a virgin before clicking to queue.","replies":[{"poster":"Vastaylan","date":"2017-06-26T13:42:36.320+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"~~Already have the goat ready~~","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"I am Pacman","date":"2017-06-26T18:10:32.779+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Make sure your team has a bunch of different trinkets.  Typically blue on adc/mid, green on top/mid, red on sup/jungle.  This doesn't always apply and if your team is bad and forgets to change then I'd reccomend picking up their slack and upgrading to whatever trinket is needed.  Also look up some good warding guides.  Good warding and vision denial is pretty objective so its an easier thing to learn and pick up.\n\nOverall try and be mindful of what you are doing.  Make decisions and even minute movements (which side of the lane you are standing on for example) conscientiously and above all know WHY you are doing that.  Read plenty of guides covering everything, how to freeze waves, zones of control, rotations, how to splitpush without getting caught etc.   Slowly try and apply things you remember to your current game at hand until you can confidently say why you are farming the side lane, why you engaged, why you dove, why you decided to back now, why you went for that cs.\n\nDon't tilt.  This may sound stupid and hard to do but tilt decides games in low elo.  Tilting the enemy early practically guarantees a win and tilting yourself a loss.  Its hard and you will tilt but again try and be mindful about it and recognize when it starts to impact your gameplay.  \n\nGood luck","replies":[{"poster":"Vastaylan","date":"2017-06-26T18:22:58.172+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"About the trinkets considering I havent touched ranked I get like the weirdest queues especially the people I duo with being super high elo like masters every once and a while but I go against super high but if there isnt a duo thats super high elo it can range from bronze to plat on who I play with but I still see noone but the support ever change their ward","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"OceanicEyes","date":"2017-06-26T15:46:31.531+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How's your csing? CS is very important, especially when you end up in a lane where you can't kill your enemy laner. In lane, depending on the champ you're playing, it's perfectly okay to not win lane as long as you go even (similar score, keeping up in CS, keeping deaths down as much as possible). Even in bad matchups it's better to be behind in farm and play safe (freezing lane near your side, getting an early defensive component) than to snowball your enemy laner. \n\nTo further get into laning, be careful with how hard you push. Unless you can 1v2 (most champs who can need post level 6 to do this), pushing hard into the enemy tower can be suicide. If, however you have good vision and know you can escape, pushing some champions into their tower can be a great idea. \n\nIf people get toxic, you can either try to calm them down, or simply mute. Don't need to feel bad about muting if the player seriously deserves it. You'll get teams that can get way too heated in games, and you just have to shrug it off and keep playing. You will get some really cool players too though. So that helps balance it out.\n\nFor ranked I like to have at least a duo partner, that way you'll have one player on the team you can trust and rely on. \n\nAnd finally don't get discouraged if you find yourself placed low. My first season I was placed Bronze 4. Every season after that I've climbed up to Plat. Virtually every new player starts low. \n\nGood luck in ranked!","replies":[{"poster":"Vastaylan","date":"2017-06-26T17:30:41.601+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well my cs really varies but if its on an ad champion rather than a mage I usually would have somewhere around 80 cs around 10 minutes but I dont know if thats to good and I have searched up guides on wave management but I still have no idea on how to set up a freeze if you have any advice for that thanks for your tips!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Micbran","date":"2017-06-26T16:03:30.558+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Remember this: Ranked isn't for fun.","replies":[]},{"poster":"No More Coal","date":"2017-06-26T14:00:49.363+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"always ban yasuo,,,,,, Why you ask?\n\n- Yasuo's on your team sucks cock\n\n- Yasuo's on enemy teams gets penta kills","replies":[{"poster":"Vastaylan","date":"2017-06-26T14:16:55.924+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I dont wanna get into a debate but I think Yasuo's fine just really oppressive but I think his W is the only issue he has and I think that might need a mini-rework","replies":[]}]}]}
