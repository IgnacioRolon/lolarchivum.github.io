The actual quote is:\n\n\"Hey, this is a good question, but we actually very intentionally did not include any sort of progress indicator for Honor levels. Here are a few reasons why:\n\n1. We didn't want to anchor people on the \"grind\" to honor levels.

We wanted to have a few discrete levels in Honor, since bloating the number would make each feel less meaningful.

How can you equalize a common player who can get a few good games a day to someone who can get 20 good games a day? This is basically the same as asking if a player who can play more games a day than you will get levels faster.\n\n\nYou don't even have to get honored a single game during an entire season and you'd still level up eventually, albeit a lot slower than a honored player would. As long as you're not getting punished by the instant feedback system, your honor levels won't drop under any circumstances and you'd at least be at a neutral level, where the usual key frag drops aren't impacted. So you're entitled to 100% of the loot and everything above level 2 is a bonus you're getting.\n\nIt doesn't really matter how close to a level up you are.\nThe system isn't something you should \"grind\" for anyway. Being honor should be a privilege, not your right. Which means that it's up to your teammates to judge what kind of potential you had in a given game and if they want to honor you or not.

I play TT a lot so I normally get an honor or two (It's a lot easier when there are only 3 team members) and I have no idea if I have actually gone anywhere. Hell the keys I get is so small in number I wonder if I am even getting rewarded for all the work I put towards not being human garbage. \n\nI just want to know if my honors mean anything. I don't even care if I get honored at this point. I have no reason to care because the system doesn't give me any reason to care. By the time I would reach honor level 3, just like everyone else, the actual feeling of reaching that point will just be, \"That it...?\"\n\nThe old system was not any better all be it, which is the problem.

Which meant you either had to be insanely good at league and win most of your games (therefore playing less games overall) or had to grind a lot of games and win at least 50% of them to see if a drop happens.\n\nIn any case, in the earlier system, key drops were all focused on the first few drops and they were frequent, with less and less drops as the time went on. I myself managed to get 9 frags a month, and that was around 40 wins (with a 50% win rate, that's 80 games overall). This really wasn't feasible for people who had less time than me to play League and this new system doesn't even require you to win. Just play games and drops are smoothed out across the month. \n\nGetting to higher Honor levels is really irrelevant by the number itself.\nThere are better rewards and flair when you go higher but overall, people are in it for the loot. Being neutral (level 2) means exactly the same rewards as before (12 frags a month) and level 3 and higher means loading screen flair from the honor you received and a chance to drop Honor Capsules (2 key frags guaranteed as drops or 2 skins - WW and Twitch). Loading screen flair you get when you get honored by 3 people at least in the previous game and you get to keep them for exactly one game. Higher levels means more flashier flair (loading screen borders).\n\n#That's all honor is for.\nThe side benefit of the system are the rewards. The main benefit of the system is that we all know you're not a dick. The problem i'm seeing here is that a lot of people just want to minmax the system and want to know their progress and this is the most irrelevant when it comes to sportsmanlike behavior. Consistency of the behavior is relevant, your honor level is not. Higher honor levels mean that you are a good player across many, many games and since higher honor levels take a long time to reach, it also means that you're consistent. Your XP bar for honor levels does not play any relevant role in this system.","replies":[{"poster":"Kloqdq","date":"2017-07-18T14:33:52.379+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Then in that way the system fails because it doesn't meet that desired goal. Really I would rather just get flairs if I get a handful of honors and skip the stupid levels. The levels are what is making this system feel terrible. \n\nIf the system worked like, if you get honored you will get a loading screen banner, similar to the current system. As you get more honors and you get more banners, your banners will get grander, just like the level 4-5 banners. The higher you overall banner level the more likely you are to get the capsules. Then at the end of the season depending on your overall performance on honor, you got max level a handful of times. You will be rewarded. \n\nThe system is then consistently acknowledging your efforts to be a better player, while also not gating you to your sick rewards. You will see that banner, gain bigger and better banners are you level up and over time as you get higher rewards, you may get those rewards.\n\nThe idea is the same at the core but it removes the most annoying elements of both the new AND old system. Having it be super rare and unknown makes it forgettable. Having it be gated and grind-y is just painful to play with. The system I suggested would make it easier to get the banner overall, but having you need to be consistent, and rewarding you quicker for being consistent. And as you go up, you have a better chance to get rewarded with something cool. \n\nI just hate having to look at that honor level 2, and think how I get all these honors, and it doesn't matter. By the time I get level 3, I will have stopped caring all together. Just like the old system.

This takes time to accumulate and level up so it's obvious that for putting the time and effort into being a good player, will get you rewarded in the end.\n\nAnd yet, you want partial rewards now, without the need to verify if you're sportsmanlike or not? What point of an Honor system would again be if you'd be getting immediate rewards? One good game on your side doesn't mean you're a decent player that won't flame people. That would only influence people into begging for honors or honoring others that don't deserve them, just for the borders. The same way premades were doing it before. There was no point in ribbons as they never indicated why they were for. They were just spammed on top of people in order to get them, in the majority through ARAM games.\n\nSecondly, everything you do in League (or any game for that matter) is a grind. You're grinding IP for champions, for chests, for keys, for account level, for champion levels, for champion mastery, for your own skill level... \"Grinding\" is nothing more than investing time and effort into getting what you want and need. If you need ribbons, the path to them is pretty clear:\n\n#Be a sportsmanlike player.\nAnd since it takes quite a while to get to those, you can't fake your shit and grab fast honors and get borders that way. Getting Honor isn't a grind and Riot made sure your progress isn't noted anywhere because they didn't want to encourage minmax behavior of \"i have this much to get honored to the next honor level\". The fact that you don't know how long you have will make you either get your shit straight and dedicate yourself to being a good player or you'll quit faking it and won't get to higher levels by pretending you're good.\n\nHonor isn't something an honorable player needs to pay attention to. It comes naturally. Your Honor XP doesn't indicate whether you're a decent player or not, just like your account level doesn't indicate whether you're a skilled player or not. Getting to higher Honor levels isn't a milestone you need to mark on your calendar, it's an attitude adjustment that people need to work on their own. Riot said they're going to put honor counters in the future but won't be adding an Honor XP bar to indicate your honor levels.\n\nAs it stands, i agree that Honor is rather a hidden system that doesn't really indicate anything about you so i would like to get at least honor counters, which we had before.\nThat way, it would indicate on your profile that you're a player that is getting honored but for the rest of \"transparency of Honor leveling\", it's not going to happen.\n\n>I just hate having to look at that honor level 2, and think how I get all these honors, and it doesn't matter.

But you don't see that.\nAnd you shouldn't care about the Honor system just because you want loot. The point is to be(come) a sportsmanlike player and if you aren't that guy, you aren't supposed to leech off it. It's not supposed to be a burden or pressure to get honored or to give honors and you won't forget about it because at the end of each game, you're asked to honor someone or skip the ceremony altogether.\n\nYou can't turn this off so you're stuck having to look at that screen for a long time, which always reminds you that it is there. Whether you want to use it or not, that's your own thing. And there will be times where you'd honor people (even if they are rare occasions) and the system is for that.

You can still skip it and in fact a lot of people will skip honoring. You don't have to honor nor do most people want to. Hell most games it's just a guessing game of who to honor because maybe everyone is good.\n\nMY idea isn't just giving you things for free. You can beg to be honor but no one has to honor you. You need to play a good amount of games to actually get rewarded still but it removes a lot of the \"honor level\" stuff. THE MAIN ISSUE HERE.\n\nHonor level is the problem. Having levels that you can visible stare at is just a pain and not seeing it go up is annoying. I am not the only one that feels this way. I could care less about the loot. I just want to see that number go up at this point. IF you have level 1-100 with no rewards but you went up quicker than it would probably be better then this mess.

You are actively waiting and thinking about not the rewards, but your level going up. If this system was put into place, but the only change was the honor level was removed and it was all behind the scene stuff, this would be a great system. \n\nWhen your boss offers to buy you lunch you are happy for it and it feels good because you didn't expect that.

It isn't showed down your throat. The fact that you can skip it means that you can honor people if you feel like it or not if you don't. If it was shoved down your throat, there wouldn't be an option to skip it nor would there be a timer. You'd be sitting there for an eternity if you didn't want to honor anyone.

Higher tier rewards warrant higher level of Honor. It seems to me like you want to have your cake and eating it as well.\n\nYou want every drop to be random (a surprise) without the BS with levels. Your idea isn't good as this would mean any player (sportsmanlike or not) can just get lucky and draw lucky loot. The point of the system is to reward sportsmanlike players and this is what level 3 and above do. The first level up means that, across half a season, you had showed that you are truly honorable for a longer period of time. _** That's the point of the system.**_ To differentiate between players who kept their honorable status for long periods of time and make sure that the path to sportsmanlike behavior isn't easily faked by pretending to be nice for a time or just getting lucky and getting higher tier loot and being a total dick.\n\nYour progress towards a higher level is irrelevant as this would reinforce bad behavior Riot is trying to avoid - honor shouldn't be ground by brute force. It should be a background system that tracks your honorable status and it shouldn't bother you. There are other ways of showing some kind of a progression and that doesn't imply only implementing an EXP bar to track your progress as your only means to do so.

So you can't get away with not having some sort of an indicator that requires time to definitely prove that (experience or a timer). None of your proposed solutions address this problem. What you are gunning for is really equality between players and the truth is that not every player is a sportsmanlike player. Number of honors shouldn't matter for rewards as this would only force people to honor others that might not deserve them. Honor should be an opt-in experience, not something Riot forces people to give and get in order to get better rewards.\n\n Having random loot fall into your lap is still bad design as then the chances would have to be rather small and some players might get them immediately, some players might not get them in years.

The way you honor is the same. All I suggest is speed up the process and have those banners unlock and upgrade after a good number of honors.

In fact, it will destroy the point of the system if you add a meter.\n\nThis system really is just a carrot on a stick, let us be real. The point of having carrots on a stick is that the horse is chasing after the carrot, not knowing when it will fall into its mouth, so it will try its hardest to obtain it, no matter how many steps it will take. This is what Riot is aiming for, if you do not know how much you have to behave, it will encourage players to behave at their best all the time.\n\nIf you give it a meter, it will form a routine. Now the horse will demand carrots based on how many steps they've taken on a fixed rate. This totally destroys the point of the system, because people are no longer forced to behave at their best, but how much they have to behave, and how much they can misbehave before facing consequences.\n\nDo you seriously think that is going to be a good idea, Riot? I do not think so.\n\nIn fact, this system is just there to reward those who can at least behave like a decent human being, there is literally 0 drawback and only climbs if you don't troll every game. Do you believe those who ask for tangible and fast rewards, and planning grinding to get rewarded for something as simple as being decent, as well as using the meter to keep an eye on just how \"good\" they have to be, are deserving of those honour rewards in the first place? This new system really doesn't change anything from the past, mind you, as long as you don't get punished for being a prick anyway, so why are some of us so desperate to level and plan the grind for it?\n\nSome people will always use the reasoning that people are more likely to output if they know how much they need to, arguing for the existence of the honour meter. But here's the kicker, that only applies if the whatever system in question is a grind. Honour system is never meant to be a grind like IP to buy champs or something. That's why that reasoning is false. The premise of the system is that \"you might get rewarded if you never get banned\", it really is never meant to be a grind. And I also do think some of that percentage-ish algorithm from the previous Honour system is also used in the current one because I'm sure I heard or read that somewhere it was said that beyond raw numbers, rate is also used as part of the calculation or something, in order to prevent people just grind it out with the number of games played or that people can't get it because they don't play as much or something (which I hope is true).\n\nDo not just listen to the whim of some of us on the community, go through it and have a think about it yourself.\n\n................\n\nTL;DR Adding a meter destroys the point and the design of the system on various levels.

In fact, it's part of why I oppose the introduction of honour meters. Because meters gives the player how much they have to behave, so they can work out how much they can be toxic too. That's why if fake nice is better than toxic, imo you will oppose the honour meter, as without knowing how much one has to behave, it forces them to behave at their finest.\n\nYou're probably talking about the scenario where \"people get bored because of no progress so they troll\", but then again, wouldn't this also happen if they know they're climbing too slow even with the meter in place? In other words, it falls onto Riot to design a reasonable climbing mechanism and other calculations within the system, and it really doesn't matter whether or not it is visible to the players in this scenario.\n\nAnd for the other arguments I've put out, I believe not having meters strongly outweighs the benefits of having one, and it also doesn't validate the purpose of the system.","replies":[{"poster":"Vastaylan","date":"2017-07-18T10:26:41.839+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Listen if they fit in time to troll eventually they're going to get banned being reported once might not get you in trouble right away but that's because they want you to reform but it will not be tolerated forever every report on you that's correct stack's up until they believe you're not reformed and then you receive the punishment.

There are most likely built in cooldowns like chests and keys, where it just straight up doesn't give you shit after playing x games a day/getting x honors a day.\n\nThe \"don't want a grind\" thing is what made it clear to me. Games are built on grinding, and gaming companies embrace the idea of grinding to keep you playing. If there is something to grind for, but you actually get penalized for grinding the grind too quickly, then shit gets sideways with the player base. Legitimate grinds are always out there in the open for you to chase, like grinding ip, grind XP, grinding Mastery levels, etc. We know what they are, how they work, and that there is actually a carrot on the stick. Honor is the opposite, and for all we know, it's just a stick. \n\nAnytime you offer a player base rewards for doing this much of 'x', it's a grind any way you look at it.
