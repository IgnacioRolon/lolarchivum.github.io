Every match starts to spiral down the dark path of horrible people berating each other over easy mistakes. It takes the rest of the team down and really starts to make me wonder what happened to this game. After 45 minutes at times of waiting in Que, people judge a game after 5 minutes and go AFK to the sacrifice of 4 other people. Not only do you get smeared by the other team, you get in trouble if you leave the game. Why would i sit there and get stomped because someone is pouting in a corner?\r\nThe expanse of trolls has been created by the punishment system. Your account is a large investment. By punishing players that, quite frankly, have had enough of the crap they read and are just trying to have fun by losing their account gives them nothing to lose and will invest nothing into a new one. This is not only a bad cycle of toxicity, but its just bad business. I really do like your game, but with such an automatic blanket ban system, you are driving away quality players and turning them into the thing you do not want the most. I have tried to research what exactly happens when you report anything, but I doubt anything does happen because there is no response. I don&#039;t report often, but the racist, sexist and gay bashing that I read will set me off. I will say something. It is not fair that 9 other people have to read that crap with no defense. There has to be a better way than making people sit on their hands while the general trolls get free reign within your game. I would gladly pay a monthly subscription to be on a separate server just to cut down on the sheer mass of crap that involves most matches. Thanks for reading.","replies":[{"poster":"Damagefox","date":"2016-12-07T01:01:39.919+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its because No one cares about the TEAM anymore, Just thier own kills.\nits not about TEAM CARRY, but who can be the \"most op solo carry\"\nNo one is willing to look beyond thier own KDA, every player thinks they are the \"best player ever\" and throw a fit when they are proven wrong. \nI AM a support. But if my adc flips out at me and goes on about how pro they are, how they \"dont need a useless support\" I am happy to give them thier wish and go help the OTHER LANES. \nThen after adc goes 0/5 because they had no one to keep the enemy off them, to help leash, to help let them farm in piece. They flip out and try and bully support back in line \"Report my support, abandoning lane, left the adc\" \n\nPeople dont want to work as a team, they just want the 4 other players on the team as WITNESSES to their Personal glory. 4 other witnesses while the player pats themselves on the back and says \"How great am I?!\"\n\nThey think they are platinum, but even in bronze they still expect everyone else at the level THEY are at \"Well I shouldnt be bronze, I am a diamond level player\" so even in bronze, they expect everyone to play at a diamond level or \"ur trash, ur noob\"\nI had a lucian who ran in to an enemy draven, I peel draven off him, Draven comes after ME...\nand after Lucian attacks draven with ONLY autos (while draven is ripping chunks out of me, finally killing me)\nAfter draven kills me, I see \"OMG U Noob support, I almost had him, why did you have to die?!\" (yeah as If I had a choice whether or not I wanted to die while Lucian is tickling draven with basics) \nand then he spends the entire game flaming me, telling me how much of an idiot/noob/F#$%in Moron I am over something I had no say in. \n\nSo again, about time to retire the \"summoners code\" considering no one cares about it anymore and the ones that do are laughed right off the system\nIts no longer about winning as a team\nBut who has most kills \nand\n1v1 me bruh\n\nThat is what league has become.","replies":[]},{"poster":"fumiefan","date":"2016-12-07T05:16:28.806+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You are correct.\n\nLeague players aren't some manic assholes are or anything like that. \n\nCompetitive people just get put with teammates or get in stuck in games that they feel they can't win, and since the only way out is to end the game or take a penalty, people feel helpless. You get to the point where you know there is nothing you can do and the easiest way to get rid of the feeling is to start dumping on someone.  You can't even just sit at base and wait it out because then you get leaverbustered anyway.\n\nI just had a game where it was 39-9 at 20 mins. Our team said no on the surrender. Our Ivern just flat out left because he didn't want to flame or sit through the whooping. I didn't blame him and I actually honored him, because it was little more than punishment at that point. I managed to refrain from flaming but believe me, at that score, it took every fiber in me to do so. I even wanted to AFK myself but couldn't because I did that the other day in a similar situation.\n\nAlso totally agree that banning an account is not enough of a threat. Anyone who has been banned before invests as a little as money as possible into the next account. It's a big deal to ban an account with $500 on it. It's nothing to ban an account with $20 on it. Getting banned is no threat to anyone who doesn't spend money on this game.\n\nIt's really frustrating though that League seems to have very little interest in fixing this system though, when it's clear there is a problem.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mister Punches","date":"2016-12-07T01:16:12.112+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There seems to be an inverse trend concerning player population and attitude when it comes to league: As player population goes up, general attitude of the community goes down/becomes more toxic.

I keep telling people.\nThe players on this game seem to forget a moba is a -TEAM- Based game\nBut Like Call of duty, the players just want to focus on treating it like it is a \"Call of duty Free for all\" style match.\nTeamwork doesnt matter, Objectives are often completely ignored. The only time anyone actually goes for dragon is after the the enemy takes it. I have seen people who will get the message \"Enemy team has slain the X drake\" and then 10 seconds later ping dragon asking for assistance \"help me take dragon\"\n\nPeople dont want to play as a team, they just want to compete with thier teammates to see who can have the most kills. Why do you think people get such a bug up thier butt about any percieved \"KS\"\nThey arent thinking \"Hey, enemy is dead, lets push\"\nthey are thinking \"I claimed that kill for MYSELF, You took it from ME. You stole what was Mine!\" And so they will throw a complete tantrum. They dont care about winning, they care more about thier kda, to be able to say \"I have more kills, so I am better than you!. ur just trash/noob\"\n\nSo yeah, There is a reason I hate call of duty players, they infect other team based games and turn them into just  withered husks of good games, \nall so one spoiled brat on the team can puff out thier chest, toss thier nose in the air and say \"see, Look how much better I am than You\"\nThese players dont want teammates, they want witnesses to thier own narcissism/vanity (The \"Look how awesome I AM\" mentality","replies":[{"poster":"Mister Punches","date":"2016-12-07T02:33:26.624+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was a Call of Duty player back before I found out about League, and I left the Call of Duty community because they were extremely toxic, to the point where death threats and belittling someone for not having 'x', or not doing something correctly was commonplace. I joined the Call of Duty community while I was a Freshman in high school (So, around Call of Duty 2) because I wanted to leave an older toxic gaming community, and it wasn't that bad. Then, when Modern Warfare came around, the toxic part of the community reared its ugly head in full force, which by the time Modern Warfare 2 came out, I ditched the Call of Duty franchise and community altogether.\n\nThe same exact trend is also happening right now for League. I joined League because I wanted to escape the toxic community of Call of Duty, and at first, the League community wasn't that bad. Skip forward a couple of years, and the toxic part of the community reared its ugly head in full force, exactly like Call of Duty. The age demographic of each community is extremely similar as well when comparing the two games together, which explains a lot, actually (The majority age demographic of Call of Duty is between the ages of 10-17, while for League, the majority demographic [at least, self-reported, which has some bias, but it's something to work off] is around 12-17).","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-12-06T20:57:45.268+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Welcome to preseason, it is always like this.
