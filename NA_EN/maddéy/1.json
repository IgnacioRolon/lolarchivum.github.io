It says that the client had restored to the older version for whatever reason. It's hard to express how frustrated I am, can I fix it anyhow?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-22T21:29:53.957+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since you were disconnected from that game, I want to make sure we troubleshoot that first.
