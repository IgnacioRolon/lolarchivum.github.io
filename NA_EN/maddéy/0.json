It happens when Im about to die, I believe it sometimes happen when i place my first trinket (ward). Someone might know what is causing it, and maybe I can find a way to get rid of it? I cant count how many times I have died being unable to heal or flash, it's so annoying. I can run the game at 60fps at max settings throughout it's whole length, so it's even weirder in that aspect.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-15T16:10:24.969+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's possible that a bad game file or outdated driver could be failing to render specific moments in-game, and causing a drop in your frames.
