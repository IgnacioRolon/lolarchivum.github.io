Fun as hell, but unhealthy. \n\nGameplay wise she still feels similar to me, and matches my playstyle so I didn't have to many qualms with her new kit.

It sucks that you aren't happy with the rework but Riot can't please everyone.

Any long ranged mage has a massive advantage pre 6, and even afterwards her ult has such a high cooldown compared to before that you can&#x27;t just carelessly engage with it.\n\nJust because Akali isn't at the level of Zoe, who has the most broken launch/release League has ever seen and probably will ever see until the end of time as well as having the most unbalanceable kit ever imagined, doesn't mean Akali has no issues of her own.\n\nYou ask how come Akali has <50% win rate, I ask why is she basically pick/ban in tournaments? Because it sure as hell isn't because of the same reasons like Urgot who is only picked to autowin top lane and that's literally the end of his job, but because of the ridiculous presence she brings until late game which pro matches rarely ever reach.\n\nJust because solo queue is usually far more of a slug-fest than pro matches ever will be and that most people haven't figured her out yet due to her being not anywhere as upfront and blatantly broken as some other champs, it doesn't mean her kit doesn't pose obvious problems at a fundamental level.\n\nI mean, Ryze has stupidly bad solo queue stats too (far worse than Akali), but he's still broken as shit and a long time favourite at tournaments because of his ulti that Riot refuses to change and some other stuff like his ever problematic W and mana scaling (the former has more or less be solved to some extent, but certainly not he latter). The same or similar instances can also apply to, and I am pretty darn sure that is also the case for, Akali.","replies":[{"poster":"ZaFishbone","date":"2018-09-21T11:03:38.596+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SEKAI,realm=OCE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Lw7Htw5N,comment-id=00020000000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2018-09-21T08:46:22.316+0000)\n>\n> Just because Akali isn&#x27;t at the level of Zoe, who has the most broken launch/release League has ever seen and probably will ever see until the end of time as well as having the most unbalanceable kit ever imagined, doesn&#x27;t mean Akali has no issues of her own.\n> \n> You ask how come Akali has &lt;50% win rate, I ask why is she basically pick/ban in tournaments?

Nobody asks for nerfs for Ez, Braum, and ppl cry about the nerfs to Senju. And these are some of the best tournament champs. So why only Akali? There are always going to be champs who are good in tournaments. Doesn't mean they are broken. You can't have perfect balance. And champs who are good in pro aren't necessarily the best by a wide margin. They are often just good enough to be competitive.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Academy Kayn","date":"2018-09-21T11:45:12.902+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Because with out it, her shroud becomes a completely defensive ability, when it should be used equally for it's offensive aspects and it's defense.
