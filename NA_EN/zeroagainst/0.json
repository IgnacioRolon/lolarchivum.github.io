In this case Nami has a skill cap on her utility skills, a skill shot that's very rewarding if she hits it, a heal that can do more damage or more healing depending on how she uses it, and an ultimate that can disengage divers while buffing her allies simultaneously. She's also very squishy and very easy to single out. Not sure where the OP part fits in.","replies":[]},{"poster":"hOrnn","date":"2018-08-12T10:56:28.851+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"your getting downvoted because being good at nami takes time and effort, you go try landing those Q's and hitting the vast majority of them, even with her E, its not so easy, shes also very squishy, yah got rekt git over it.","replies":[{"poster":"Lichformed","date":"2018-08-12T16:34:13.930+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nami is my support pocket pick for autofills, she's ridiculously easy.\nThough the last time I played her was S6 or S7 start so I don't know if they have nerfed her ranges to make it harder.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ZeroAgainst","date":"2018-08-12T15:30:40.566+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=DancesWithFreelo,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=YEAkmNaZ,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2018-08-12T10:56:28.851+0000)\n>\n> your getting downvoted because being good at nami takes time and effort, you go try landing those Q&#x27;s and hitting the vast majority of them, even with her E, its not so easy, shes also very squishy, yah got rekt git over it.\n\nfunny same thing said about janna lmao","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Evangele","date":"2018-08-12T09:45:52.628+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"https://media.giphy.com/media/oCdScruZnEHfy/giphy.gif","replies":[]},{"poster":"yangus Beef","date":"2018-08-12T12:40:46.865+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"idk dude I've been waiting for three years for Nami nerfs. They need to decrease the damage on her heal and increase the cd on her bubble. If you see Nami w/ {{champion:202}} {{champion:133}} or {{champion:119}} might as well dodge because the lane is pretty much unwinnable. Nami has literally ONE bad matchup in the entire game and it's... blitzcrank, a champion that barely sees play.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Warlord Rhinark","date":"2018-08-12T09:43:44.669+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"*Incoming triggered Kythers*","replies":[]},{"poster":"Arcade Lulu","date":"2018-08-12T10:50:42.757+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"welp, somebody's mad\n{{sticker:sg-lulu}}","replies":[]}]}
