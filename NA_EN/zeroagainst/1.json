So no he hardly needs those extra stats, Pykes whole issue is he feel about as unfair as a CertT champion with the amount of stuff he gets to compensate for what would be weaknesses. Last time i checked Assassin are not really meant to be able to completely lock down and self peel themselves while having a huge sustain but because they has the excuse that he is a support, they can cover all those bases without issue.

Darius also can't execute multiple people at once. Also darius ult isn't instant and is never out of nowhere cause u need to get stacked first while pyke's is near instant and from a bush. Also you can be damaged by pyke r multiple times. If you and ur supp gets hit and ur supp dies, you'll take the damage from the ult and then get ulted again. Also pyke can chain his ults very quickly without any other gimmicks which makes his cleanup very strong. Also Darius actually needs to kill you to reset while Pyke's resets if anyone dies in the cross. Also Darius, being a bruiser has a harder time getting on key targets while pyke has a cc dash and a stealth. Also. Do you see how many also's.

And the fact that his ult is a skillshot?","replies":[{"poster":"Deνiruchi","date":"2019-07-13T20:35:50.716+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I hate Cho, but he at least has to walk up to you to eat you, and it's a single target without resets. Urgot's skillshot can be body blocked and doesn't scale with damage, the treshhold will always be the same (25%). No other champion with executes or high true damage ulties have Pyke's amount of mobility and regen and resets (except Darius who resets ults but still has to walk up to every single target).","replies":[{"poster":"Wolfeur","date":"2019-07-13T23:02:46.211+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"I mean, we have to put things in perspective, too:\n\nUrgot: fairly tanky (juggernaut), ult is a massively ranged linear skillshot, slows, deals %HP pure damage (the thing we're supposed to be against, remember?), and AoE fear afterwards.\n\nCho: very tanky, ult is point-and-click true damage, gives permanent and indefinitely-stacking health, which amplifies subsequent damage.\n\nDarius: fairly tanky (juggernaut), ult is point-in-click true damage, scales with passive stacks, activates passive, resets on kill.\n\nPyke: overly squishy (can't build HP), ult is an X-shaped skillshot (easy to miss or dodge), deals physical damage if not executing, makes you blink to melee range on hit (potentially killing you in the process).\n\nYou see, it's easy to just portray things a certain way. Pyke's ult has pros, and it has cons. Pyke is an assassin, the ult threshold is a fixed amount to kill squishies, while Urgot's is a %HP amount because he's a tank killer. Pyke's is ranged because he needs to be able to leave melee afterwards, while Darius has sustain mechanics for fighting at close range, and Cho has CC to reach his opponent. Pyke's give more gold because he's an assassin with a support's income and he needs to execute to be functional.\n\nAn advice: if you think you'll be ulted by Pyke, move up/down/left/right. His ult's shape is diagonal; moving in the cardinal directions will make you leave the hitbox fairly quickly.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Jennifer420","date":"2019-07-13T20:17:30.497+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"cho doesnt have to stack. it just does more damage with stacks (and he has to go meele range)","replies":[]},{"poster":"NA Darklarik","date":"2019-07-13T05:14:46.330+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Pyke, Darius and Chogath have very different power managed throwout their kit, of course their executes are going to be different. \n\nWithout his R Pyke is slippery but otherwise absurdly weak by assassin standards or melee support standards.\n\nDarius is strong all around even without his ult and Chogath is a moving CC machine that can 1k True damage demolish you, not to mention he can also steal objectives with it.\n\nDont compare the power placed into one aspect of Pykes kit to another champion's without looking at the rest of his abilities genius.","replies":[]}]}
