This game nets like a billion a year so its hardly FREE!) I realize that all riot cares about is the money it can make from the pro portion of this game, but seriously!!!  ALL of your new game modes suck.  Especially this Nexus Siege crap.  Riot you are beyond lazy.  Why cant you stop coming up with endless hours of worthless lore about BS.  Who cares about videos showing sad mummies and retelling a crap story about some crazy flat chested nut bag?  You should be making sure the game play in ALL of your game modes are as smooth as silk before you make a single nonsense video or story.  Polish your game already.  I get that ARAM is always going to be unfair as hell, but there is no reason the rotating weekend games shouldn&#039;t be.  I know you can handle this cause if you can code this game and those modes, you can (with a little extra time spent on important stuff) code it in so that characters stats and abilities adjust according to game modes.  Putting in a cheap ass 6 ban thing is lazy and sloppy.  BALANCE THE GAME MODES AND STOP BRING OUT NONSENSE!!!!","replies":[]}
