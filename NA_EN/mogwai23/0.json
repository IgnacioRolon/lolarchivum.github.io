The simple fact that riot is doing absolutely nothing about it proves that to them each skin is worth 0 dollars, but charge you and I 20 to 100 dollars per.  That to me is beyond fucked up.  Especially when the boards are swarming with people upset about current pricing and the direction the skins and add-ons are taking.  Its a slap to our faces.  To make such a huge mistake and not respond to the masses as soon as possible is like spitting in our faces.  If your mad you have a right to be.  (For those who hope on the boards and flame the first post they see or havent been paying attention I am referring to the free skins that LOL let out.)   Even though it was plainly obvious since its all over the boards.  ","replies":[]}
