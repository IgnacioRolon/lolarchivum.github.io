At the moment, we're looking into some issues where mouse buttons 3-5 aren't being recognized by League after certain Windows Creator updates. We might be able to get those buttons working again with the method Elduris mentioned, but let's try resetting your config files first to see if that helps.\n\n- Log into the game client\n- Navigate to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config\n- Delete the file  named **game.cfg** and **persistedsettings.json**\n- Go into a custom game and verify that settings have saved properly. \n- Leave game to sync settings\n\nHit me back and let me know if either of those suggestions worked!","replies":[{"poster":"PAL Falco","date":"2017-04-24T22:47:06.075+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im 100% sure its because of the Windows Creator Update I installed some days ago.\nYour Solution didnt quite work + reinstalling the drivers + software didnt work. ima try elduris solution later that day.\ngrt","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-24T23:02:55.428+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahhhhhh knowing that you're running the Creators update changes things a bit. We've seen a number of reports about keybinds not working on the Creators updates since they are still in beta.

I have a Logitech G502 and the few buttons on it seem to be recognized fine. But if you have one with more than a few, make sure you've downloaded the drivers and external software for the mouse, then try again.\n\nEDIT: I found this [really old post about keybindings](http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=1341075&page=1#post15644321). It is really old and there were probably a lot of changes made, but it's something to look at.","replies":[]}]}
