Easy to learn burst combos, good itemization, reliable escapes, early lane harass and post-6 dominance, scaling AD due to his W and relatively decent defense stats.\r\n\r\nCompared to other assassins, he just has a lot going for him. Yeah, you can cleanse deathmark but his burst will get you low enough for an ignite and a passive proc to take you down unless you're sorta tanky. Also most people won't buy mercurial or sash before their core items.\r\n\r\nYeah, like all assassins, bad players will be bad with him. He isn't like WW or Udyr, but mediocre players with mediocre mechanics while still knowing his burst combo can still do very well with him compared to other assassins such as Talon, LeBlanc and Rengar.\r\n\r\nTalon has to go all-in otherwise he's dead, same with Rengar.\r\n\r\n LeBlanc has bad clear which means you can shove lane into tower and cause her to miss CS or force her to use spells which means less mana while Zed is energy-based and has good clear and CS ability due to his passive. \r\n\r\nAkali gets heavily countered by pinks or sweepers (even though that's sort of an unhealthy counterplay mechanic) and her pre-6 threat level is quite low.\r\n\r\n Kha Zix gets mana starved easily and is very easy to poke down. \r\n\r\nYasuo is a skill matchup in Zed's favour since Zed has safer pokes and all-ins. \r\n\r\nLissandra is the only real counter but she counters all mobility champs. \r\n\r\nAhri has to land a skillshot charm that doesn't pass through minions unlike Zed's shurikens plus she gets blown up easily by Zed.\r\n\r\nTF isn't very useful till mid and late game and even then needs CS for items and gets blown up easily even then.\r\n\r\nDon't get me wrong, this isn't a rant thread. I don't have a lot of problems playing against Zed since I know how he works and I only ever bother playing Yasuo and Lissandra mid but compared to other assassins, he just has too much going on. Yeah, maybe he falls off late game but all he really needs to do is run to the backline and kill the two damage dealers while your adc and fighters deal with the frontline which all Assassins should be doing but Zed can do it better, faster and with reliable escapes.\r\n\r\nI love playing Zed though, the only ninja that really feels like a ninja.","replies":[{"poster":"Long Dong Wukong","date":"2014-11-30T03:01:39.739+0000","up_votes":23,"down_votes":3,"body":"Fizz","replies":[{"poster":"Brenticus12","date":"2014-11-30T03:29:30.570+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":9,"body":"Fizz is also a big problem but his escapes are not as diverse and reliable as Zed's.\nFizz doesn't have good poke unless you let him run upto you, it's easy to juke his troll pole, baiting it out and making it hard for him to escape and his ult is a skillshot even though it has a weird hitbox that I'm pretty annoyed about.\n\nOverall, Fizz is annoying but imo not as bad as Zed since Zed has all that Fizz has but more.","replies":[{"poster":"Llanite","date":"2014-11-30T07:48:50.766+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"Pretty much this. \n\nYou can starve a Fizz/Lb/Kass/Akali with a good pusher and/or having jungler camp the lane.

Essentially, Zed can afford to be a total moron FAR too often for an assassin, which are supposed to \"strike when the time is right - no sooner, no later\" according to Riot. Well let me tell you, Zed sure as hell can afford to not strike when the time is right. \n\nSecond, Zed has a lot of safety involved in his kit even when you ignore the above. If Zed finds that laning is difficult, he can just safely farm and then scale up later anyway. It's absolutely insane that an assassin has such strong wave clear as early in the game as Zed does.\n\nAnd THEN we take into account the fact that Zed runs on energy, which means infinite poke and wave clear in lane. In my opinion, it is an inherently idiotic notion for an assassin to have access to essentially infinite ranged harass that is only limited by cooldowns, which also goes over minions for good measure. Aren't assassins supposed to be risky?  If most other assassins miss with spells, they just chunked their own mana bar and didn't get much out of it. If Zed misses, the consequence is...well, damn, I have to try again later.\n\nSeriously.

If Akali and Fizz are losing lane for whatever reason, they do not have the option to simply waveclear from a distance and scale up with farm anyway. Fizz also suffers from the poor design choice of having an engage and an escape that are not gated by anything outside of resource cost. Fizz also has the problem of his trollpole being on a pretty short cooldown given how strong the ability is in general.\n\nFor example, compare Fizz and Zed to Kha'Zix or Kat. Kha'Zix and Kat both have an all-in that is also an escape, but they can not use it as both unless they kill the target. Zed and Fizz do not share this limitation and can all-in and then escape whenever they want, although Zed is arguably worse in that department because he does not sacrifice any damage to do so.\n\nI would argue that Akali's ONLY issue in terms of basic design is that she has too many dashes, and her dashes have too much range. Outside of that particular issue, I would say Akali's kit is pretty well designed and thus is pretty easy to fix in terms of balance. It confuses me as to why Riot hasn't done so. But Akali DOES operate on high risk high reward because if she all-ins and doesn't get a kill, she is denied ult charges and the enemy team can just drop a pink and then murder her with few problems. The only issue is that it's very hard to deny her that kill, because of the nature of her dashes.\n\nKassadin is hardly an assassin anymore and is more of an AP bruiser that happens to have stupid mobility these days. But his problems are similar to Zed and Fizz - he can all in with little risk because his ultimate will be back up by the time zhonya's runs out.\n\nIgnoring all that, bringing up other assassins doesn't mean that Zed is suddenly well designed. If every other assassin in the game were poorly designed, that doesn't mean that it's suddenly ok for future assassins to be poorly designed as well.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"The Jubbinator","date":"2014-11-30T04:30:43.422+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":3,"body":"As someone who also loves watching Zed plays I'd disagree on some of those things. His laning is definitely good but if he uses his shadow in lane to poke your jungler should learn to go in while it's on an 18 second cooldown. In teamfights if he doesn't use his shadows effectively when he ults someone he can easily be cc'd. Generally I see that Zed's can have a problem with teams that group tightly and protect their squishies in fights. Also, if a Zed doesn't get fed early, it's really hard for him to kill people without items from kills. Pay attention to Zed's changes that have been made within the past year. November of season 3 they changed his ult shadow to what it is now and his w travels slower. The only people complaining about him during that time were ragers that had just lost a game to a fed Zed or something. Then patch 4.14 came out where the only changes to him were placing him behind ulted targets and ignoring unit collision when he ulted.
