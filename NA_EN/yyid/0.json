I feel bad on this mistake because if i have bought those two, then I could've wasted my money.\r\nPlease don't make any mistakes like me not only for me, but for everyone else.\r\nGo into my account and check it. Thank you.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-22T23:33:09.116+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeeeeaaaaa none of those skins cost that much originally. I'm guessing that you don't own Shen or Olaf yet, and those prices are the reduced price of the skin + the price of the champion. If you buy one of those, it will unlock the champion and skin at once.","replies":[{"poster":"LianPlayz","date":"2017-05-22T23:40:10.897+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Still need help with my issue and my ticket.

I see your ticket, but it looks like the billing team is just a liiiiiiiittle bit backed up at the moment. I'm going to have someone grab your ticket shortly, but in the meantime make sure that you're entering the entire code in the pre-paid card section **including the REP-US part**. \n\nIf that's not working still, we should be able to get it cleared up in your ticket, but you can also contact amazon in the meantime to see if they can get the code fixed too! I like to give as many options as possible ^_^!\n\nhttps://i.gyazo.com/8e4026bc206f219a9305d20e2de9ff87.png","replies":[{"poster":"LianPlayz","date":"2017-05-23T23:20:17.499+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Freaking thanks man!
