My spells also had weird delays like whenever I pressed E Ekko would just stand there. Like, the animations will just stall randomly.  The problem only worsened as I couldn't even move my camera at all. At that point, I had to lock my camera, which only seemed to respond when locked at that point. Afterward, when I hit lvl 18 I couldn't put points into any skills.  Anyway, I was somehow able to finish the first phase of the fight with a decent K/D/A, so I decided to just deal with it. When it came time for the second phase of the match I could only move the camera up and down. So once again, I locked my camera. This time I couldn't buy items either or place points into my desired spell. Instead, I would put points into W even when I would repeatedly click on Q. I couldn't even leave the platform, so I just rage quit and came here. I recorded what was going on though.\n\nAccording to the log reader I'm not having packet loss either.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-01T04:25:10.707+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmmm what you're describing typically sounds like packet loss, but since you've already used our log reader we can rule that possibility out! This might have something to do with your config files. Let's try resetting your config files to see if that get everything back to normal. \n\n- Log into the game client.\n- Navigate to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config\n- Delete the file  named **game.cfg** and **persistedsettings.json**\n- Go into a custom game and verify that settings have saved properly.  \n- Leave game to sync settings.\n\nLet me know if your camera starts working normally again after resetting those files!","replies":[{"poster":"Calintz6565","date":"2017-04-01T08:31:27.651+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you so much.
