There is even delay some times when i hit the creeps, but my connection still stays at 30-40 ms so its not my connection. I dont know if someone is trying to ddos the servers while playing, or that someone is using scripts that could cause the servers to lag for other players??","replies":[{"poster":"wiskyboy","date":"2016-09-02T08:26:15.261+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok thanks i think you gave me the information i needed","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-30T16:53:37.746+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you may be experiencing packet loss or high packet buffering.
