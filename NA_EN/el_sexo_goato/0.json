CC tanks just completely outclass all other junglers. I think we should consider, instead of just nerfing cinderhulk into the ground like they&#039;ll probably end up doing, the warrior enchant getting some sort of scaling. It currently is only good on assassin junglers like Kha Zix and Rengar (if you are one of those people who build full-AD rengo). It&#039;s okay on bruisers like Rek&#039;Sai and Vi, but cinderhulk is just generally better especially since Black Cleaver offers all the things warrior does, plus health.\n\n I like the idea of it getting some version of Atma&#039;s passive so bruisers could get maybe one other damage item and then build defense. There would obviously be some problems with that like the fact that it would hardly benefit assassin&#039;s at all, but that isn&#039;t so bad. The biggest issue with this is that it could become cancerous for top lane, where every other person brings tp/smite. I&#039;m no expert on the numbers in LoL or balance in general, so obviously this scenario could turn into a balance nightmare. However, I think buffing the other jungle items slightly while nerfing cinderhulk a wee bit is a better path than simply nerfing cinderhulk into oblivion. \n\nOn a side note, you could also remove devourer, since it is useless on 99% of junglers and any that can build it benefit just as much from warrior, with the exception of warwick of course, but f**k warwicks, you can build cinderhulk. (and the item is cancer on warwick, considering when I build it, I can easily get up to over 100 magic damage per hit, even without simply power farming)\n\nEdit: It would also be interesting that maybe instead you combine devourer into warrior and magus so instead of doing bonus on hit damage per large monster killed, you gain a stack per monster kill and at some number of stacks you get a point of bonus AD/AP (or something like that). You gain some number of stacks per champion kill. It takes more stacks as you gain a larger and larger bonus (acting sort of like how Thresh's passive used to work). This would psuedo-cap the bonus so the jungle doesn't just turn into a farm fest while offering some kind of late game scaling to Magus and Warrior.","replies":[{"poster":"ProfDrDeath","date":"2015-06-04T15:43:12.478+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Interesting thought. I am just not sure if I like the idea of reintroducing Atma's passive to League, but Warrior definitely needs something unique.\n\nFor Devourer, I am not sure at all if the limitless scaling nature of that item needs to exist. At this point, I think it would be better if that item would be changed to something more like old Wriggles. And by that, I mean S2 Wriggles that gave you real Lifesteal, not S4 Wriggles.","replies":[{"poster":"El Sexo Goato","date":"2015-06-08T20:57:06.760+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Limitless scaling is a bit ridiculous. But it would offer some sort of end-game power for bruisers who want warrior. 10 armor pen just doesn't scale as well as +25% bonus health, especially with the prevalence of tanks who can stack 200+ armor.\n\n Giving it % armor pen wouldn't really work either. It would make it scale into late game better, but then you exacerbate the problem of stacking Black Cleaver, Warrior, Last Whisper and Youmuu's, which is already a very potent combo. \n\nWhat, in your opinion, was the problem with Atma's before? I hardly ever saw it being built, simply because crit + armor + ad scaling off health isn't the most useful of combos for most champs. And even if someone built it and just stacked health, they'd only end up with like 90 bonus ad IF they could get 6000 health. That is barely more than Bloodthirster or IE, which only take up one slot. So it definitely wasn't the most powerful item.\n\nI also just really wanted to highlight the need for warrior to get something to increase its usefulness. I don't really care one way or another if Atma's gets reintroduced.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Android Cowboy","date":"2015-06-04T17:13:53.124+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Keep your stinking hands off my DEVOURER, you damned dirty RITO.\n\nSeriously, though, I run VI/Darius/Volibear with devourer and usually the other champ isn't expecting to get dropped so fast in duels :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"PÃ¦an","date":"2015-06-04T15:44:14.917+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You ever see shaclone play AD bruiser or tank shaco?\nHE has a game where he hits 5000 hp, is extremely tanky from resists, and still out damages an ADC in a 1v1.","replies":[]}]}
