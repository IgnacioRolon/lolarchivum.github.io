When the servers moved to chicago it made it a lot harder as my ping increased to around 230, but I've started to get used to that. Now it has increased again after the most recent patch to about 260 and it's getting too hard to deal with at this point.\r\n\r\nAnyone else getting this? Any solutions?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-13T05:58:30.459+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Due to your physical distance from the NA servers, there will be limitations to the latencies you can achieve. I know this because I play with a lot of my friends in Australia on the OCE servers and I get about 200ish in latency, regardless of what configurations I try from my end. The best thing you can do is ensure your local network settings are configured properly for League, according to our [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues).\n\nIf you have any further questions, let me know.","replies":[{"poster":"Norak","date":"2017-02-20T11:42:45.027+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been able to deal with 220 ping to a degree but 260 ping is making it really hard, and seeing has I had 220 ping just a few weeks ago there might be some way to get it back again.\n\nIs there any known reason why my ping would have spiked from 220~ to 255~ after the most recent patch?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-21T21:46:34.684+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Any number of routing or configuration changes by your ISP or the partners they work with in order to route your connection to our servers could have caused the latency change. In order to see what your network route looks like, we'll need to run a traceroute logs with [**WinMTR**](http://winmtr.net/). After loading up the application, simply plug **104.160.131.1** into the host field and start the trace. After 5 minutes has gone by, export the results as text and paste them in a reply.\n\nLet me know if you run into any issues with this.","replies":[{"poster":"Norak","date":"2017-02-22T11:28:12.674+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry for the format, I assume if you copy and paste it into a notepad it will go back to normal though.\n\nIf I were to take an uneducated guess I'd say the issue would be with i-52.tlot-core02.bx.telstraglobal.net, which is part of Telstra's network (an Australian ISP).

Your latency continues to rise as your connection is handed off to Zayo infrastructure as it reaches the States. I strongly recommend reaching out to your ISP's tier 2 support team so they can launch an investigation. \n\nLet me know if you have any other questions.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Norak","date":"2017-02-22T11:25:02.395+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n\n|                                      WinMTR statistics                                   |\n\n|                       Host              -   %  | Sent | Recv | Best | Avrg | Wrst | Last |\n\n|------------------------------------------------|------|------|------|------|------|------|\n\n|                             192.168.0.1 -    0 |  391 |  391 |    0 |    0 |    5 |    0 |\n\n|                   No response from host -  100 |   78 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |\n\n|      CPE-58-160-248-1.wa.bigpond.net.au -    0 |  391 |  391 |   10 |   14 |   28 |   14 |\n\n|bundle-ether4.win-edge901.melbourne.telstra.net -    0 |  391 |  391 |   10 |   15 |   31 |   14 |\n\n|bundle-ether11.win-core10.melbourne.telstra.net -    0 |  391 |  391 |   11 |   16 |   32 |   17 |\n\n|bundle-ether12.ken-core10.sydney.telstra.net -    0 |  391 |  391 |   22 |   26 |   49 |   29 |\n\n|bundle-ether1.pad-gw11.sydney.telstra.net -    0 |  391 |  391 |   22 |   27 |   49 |   25 |\n\n|bundle-ether1.sydp-core04.sydney.reach.com -    0 |  391 |  391 |   22 |   27 |   48 |   25 |\n\n|   i-52.tlot-core02.bx.telstraglobal.net -    0 |  391 |  391 |  199 |  203 |  217 |  199 |\n\n|   i-0-5-0-3.eqla01.bi.telstraglobal.net -    0 |  391 |  391 |  168 |  173 |  191 |  174 |\n\n|   zayo-peer.eqla01.pr.telstraglobal.net -    0 |  391 |  391 |  167 |  172 |  202 |  173 |\n\n|                   No response from host -  100 |   78 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |\n\n|          ae0.cr2.lax112.us.zip.zayo.com -    0 |  391 |  391 |  198 |  202 |  227 |  202 |\n\n|         ae16.er2.lax112.us.zip.zayo.com -    0 |  391 |  391 |  200 |  207 |  270 |  206 |\n\n|64.125.170.174.IPYX-089814-750.zip.zayo.com -    0 |  391 |  391 |  226 |  230 |  268 |  251 |\n\n|                          104.160.133.35 -    0 |  391 |  391 |  225 |  231 |  258 |  235 |\n\n|                         104.160.159.100 -    0 |  391 |  391 |  251 |  255 |  274 |  252 |\n\n|          ae34-br01.chi01.riotdirect.net -    0 |  391 |  391 |  252 |  256 |  273 |  254 |\n\n|                           104.160.131.1 -    0 |  391 |  391 |  256 |  260 |  277 |  262 |\n\n|________________________________________________|______|______|______|______|______|______|\n\n   WinMTR v0.92 GPL V2 by Appnor MSP - Fully Managed Hosting & Cloud Provider","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
