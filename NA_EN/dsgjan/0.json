Last game I got a **bugsplat **error and yea of course I got the Leaver buster... This is the thing that I hate the most and I think that that is why people are loosing joy when playing this game. And yea leaver buster has 20 min of waiting time for 5 games... I think this is crazy and on the other  end you shouldn't give leaver buster to people who got some kind of error and they are not responsible for it. \nTy for taking your time to read this.","replies":[{"poster":"Bazerka","date":"2018-06-12T17:22:55.877+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":1,"body":"Dang :( sorry you had to experience this. I've certainly gotten my fair share of \"wtf\"s before. Thats a good idea (I dunno how tricky it would be, but good idea) to see if its possible to detect a fail / crash state in the game and make you immune to Leaver buster. I imagine one would need to figure out how to avoid people trying to spoof the system to simply que dodge when they want to punish their team or something.

You'd need to get to a state where you can even try to detect the failure before you need to worry about people spoofing it. \n\nIt is a real problem that the Leaver penalty hits you when you've done nothing wrong, I posted yesterday about a game where I locked in (sound effect played and everything) and it didn't take. I could still switch champions but the option to lock in didn't come back and the count down expired as if I afked the lobby and I got the leaver penalty. \n\nI'm all for the leaver buster system because I believe routing people out of the game who consistently ruin the experience for others by quitting early is  an attempt to improve or at least maintain the health of the game. However, while doing so you guys really need to look inward and find a way to make sure your failures (bugsplats and other various failures are errors in your code) are not being heaped punitively on the player. Thanks for looking into it and passing it along.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"tiny bubby","date":"2018-06-13T19:16:36.960+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"same thing for me, last patch had the same problem. I either fail at loading screen and get bugsplatted or get bugsplatted at 0%. I just tried playing 3 games after this patch and it happened to two of the games, got leaver bustered and now I have low priority queue. debating on quitting since this just happened last patch too and it wasn't resolved, instead, riot blames my connection.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Aminumbra","date":"2018-06-13T18:02:08.054+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll add something else. It is a 3 or 4 months old anecdot, but I guess this is still how it works now.\nSo, during a ranked game, my PC just crashed. A shutdown, for \"no reason\" ( may be the heat, I don't know ).\nI spent may be 10 minutes to reconnect, because it is quite slow to boot again, and the reconnexion didn't work at first, etc.\nBut, because I was destroying my opponent, and as my team was doing well, they were still totally fine in 4v5 during this time.\nI finally managed to reconnect, after several tries, and we quickly ended the game as I was still \"OK\" in the game, due to the massivev advantage I had before my crash.\nAaaaand I lost 18LP.\nBasically, if you have a PC problem, try your hardest to win a game, finally come back and end the game because you were so ahead of your opponent that 10 minutes still didn't allow him to catch you up, Riot doesn't give a fuck and will still make you lose 18 LP.\nIt didn't happen since this day, but now, make sure that next time my PC crash, I'll let it cool down, and I won't bother reconnecting. Why would I, if the result is the same ? Sympathy for my teammates ? Well, so bad, this is a team game where you're not choosing your team, next game they might be against me, a good strategy could be to tilt them beforehand.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Catastrophic","date":"2018-06-13T17:45:30.064+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thing is, it's probably not that difficult to force a bugsplat in league, so people would abuse that.
