More than ever now it is boring and dull until late.  Once it is late, there is no coming back. One team fights, they win, and then use these stupid death timers to simply put the other team into a hole that they can&#039;t claw back from.  You have your shoutcasters screaming at the end of the matches, but screaming about something doesn&#039;t make it exciting.  Having a team fight at their nexus isn&#039;t exciting, it&#039;s boring.  Because win or lose, they&#039;re done.  They&#039;re not going to win, even if they win that particular holding action.\r\n\r\nEssentially games are boring and decided at one fight.  The games aren&#039;t even shorter by all that much like you planned.  You&#039;ve given up excitement and multiple fights in the game for an extra what?  Two minutes or three minutes of game shortening?\r\n\r\nJesus, Jatt JUST admitted as much when he said that the C9 vs. TSM game was &quot;about 25 minutes of stuff that isn&#039;t fun to analyze and 4 minutes of stuff that is.&quot;\r\n\r\nTHAT is what you want for your game?  Long periods of boredom with one brief spat of &#039;excitement&#039; and you think that will draw in new viewers?\r\n\r\nGet it together.  This is the only season thus far that I&#039;m actually feeling my enthusiasm for watching diminish rather than grow.  Each week I get to see at least three of the five games be utterly boring.  Usually more than that.","replies":[{"poster":"PogChampEleGiggl","date":"2016-01-30T21:45:34.078+0000","up_votes":68,"down_votes":1,"body":"I thought raising the death timer was the most retarded idea ever, +1","replies":[{"poster":"IceKingChernobog","date":"2016-01-31T00:10:29.966+0000","up_votes":37,"down_votes":1,"body":"that and completely nerfing vision","replies":[{"poster":"A Miss Fortune","date":"2016-01-31T04:41:41.656+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't even understand why they thought vision was a problem.

Just passive-aggressive clearing.\n\nThis was a step in the right direction, but Riot goes to extremes way too often before settling in a middle-ground - they should have had the vision trinkets be more bloody useful so that the game became less about wards-wards-wards-wards-wards and more about, \"Okay, so we have a limited amount of wards.  We need to plan out where we want this coverage and how we're going to go about doing it.\" Do you want dragon covered with wards or baron covered with wards? Do you want to split them down the middle and risk having spots uncovered? The old way was one team dominated, had total coverage, and leaving the base became impossible - the new way is nobody has coverage, everybody's confused where anyone is, the entire game's a joke, and fuck this shit I quit. The way it should be is we have our target objected warded out, we have some defensive wards in case something happens, and we're set to go.\n\nThen they push down a tower and dragon.\n\nThen they hear baron die.\n\nThen they go, \"Fuck we misplayed our wards, we need to plan better next time.\"\n\nInstead of it being, \"Fuck we have no wards at all because it's an entire fucking minute before I can even get another one and clearing trinkets last for 12 seconds.

Win a 4v4 dragon fight 4-0? You'll probably get dragon and 1 outer turret. \n\nThen it comes to late game. The turret count can be 7-0 in favor of your team, but the enemy team either gets a catch or a good outplay or outscaled or who knows. Whatever happened, they get even a mere 4-2 teamfight win (so they have 3 alive, you have 1) and can easily push down mid outer, inner, and inhibitor turrets. If they aced you with even only 1 or 2 people alive they can often take an inhibitor as well. If the game's past 50 minutes? You can literally go from having not lost a single turret to watching your nexus explode on your only death of the entire game. Not a fan of that at all, and I've had it happen to me. \n\nLet me get a real **map** advantage from plays in the early game. Don't just make my champion stronger so I can stomp my lane opponent - that's not fun for the opponent at all. \n\nReduce kill gold slightly, reduce kill xp significantly, increase death timers in the early game slightly (say 15-20 seconds), increase death timers in the mid game (say 25-30 seconds), and decrease death timers in the late game (cap them at around 40 seconds...).","replies":[{"poster":"NichtHurz","date":"2016-02-01T07:11:41.258+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think it's okay that a team can just push from the outer turret to the Nexus if the enemy team still failed at finishing the game at minute 50.

The punishment possible for losing a teamfight around minute 35 is just way too much.","replies":[{"poster":"ValyrianBlade","date":"2016-02-01T23:55:19.004+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with most of this.\n\nThe reason I don't like one ace ending the game at the post 50-minute mark (especially if it's a 5-4 ace) is that a team which has been consistently outplayed the entire match can win with one good decision / outplay / catch going in their favor. \n\nI wouldn't mind at all if mid inner turret was already down and they only had to take the inhibitor turret onwards after the ace, that would mean the team has at least taken some objectives (and therefore made some good plays already) prior to the won teamfight.\n\nI've had a handful of games where my team will be consistently and slowly building a lead. We're talking really close games where the gold lead graph is steadily climbing in our favor at a constant rate and only around 3-4k by the 50 minute mark. We've made maybe 4 or 5 strategic outplays to the enemy team's 0. We've taken all 6 lane turrets, and often 2 or 3 inhibitor turrets and even an inhibitor and sometimes even nexus turrets, and meanwhile the enemy team has either 0 turrets or possibly top/bot outer turret (often only 1 of them). Then one person makes one mistake, or the enemy team makes a sick outplay in a teamfight, or anything along those lines, and we get aced and literally watch as 5 turrets, an inhibitor, and a nexus are all destroyed while we're dead. \n\nI don't think any one mistake should be worth 7 objectives at any time in the game. 3 is more than acceptable, 4 is a tough pill I can swallow, 5 or 6 is starting to get really unreasonable, but 7 is just outright ludicrous. I mean, a 5-0 ace? Sure, they should definitely be able to take everything because that's a huge outplay. If it was a close teamfight that resulted in the winner taking 3 or 4 casualties though, I think it's pretty unfair.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"The Loveless","date":"2016-01-31T06:37:42.009+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"YES.

It's an issue the game itself has. Yes death timers are ridiculous but the fact is, again, early game is way too safe. Supports can facetank damage for the ADC. Teams can trade towers. Aggression is the jungler's job, everyone else sits back.\n\nLast season wasn't any better, teams bought double sightstone and waited for the other team to slip up with their vision.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Loveless","date":"2016-01-31T06:35:27.502+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"S2 worlds is still the best IMO. It's been getting more boring each year since teams want to play extra safe for their reward money. Didn't someone at TSM tell Turtle not to be flashy and just play like Cop? I think it's a combination of the game Riot gives us and the esport coaches. So if anything, Riot has to mold their game in a way that makes it so the coaches can't restrict their players so much by limiting what they want them to do.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Spaceman5pff","date":"2016-01-31T05:03:28.032+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://i.gyazo.com/6cf3908f8ddc0579886a2d88b5cb0320.png\n\nThis game was an hour long, as you can see there were several small comebacks which were then lost, and Red team spent most of the time in the lead.\nAt 1:02 blue team won.

I don't remember reading about it though, just had a feeling. \n\nAlthough I agree with the whole vision changes thing. I didn't at first, but saw the light (or lack thereof). You're not supposed to be able to ward every part of the map at all times. This whole less vision thing will take some getting used to, but as a whole, I think it makes the game a bit more healthy.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AquariusGine","date":"2016-01-30T23:38:16.964+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"wt f...
