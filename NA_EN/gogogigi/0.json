At first, I am not Japanese but i have been Japan for about 6 years. So, i want to talk a little bit about this whole thing in my OPNION.\n\n  The first, Japanese are not like Korean or any other asian people. Really different, in many aspects of life. Like, how they are thinking, how they are working or solving the question. \n\n  The second is more related, just imagine if you were born in the nation where is the most of people playing game with CONSOLE DEVICE (even smartphone),  COMPUTER GAMING would be something weird. \"My friend, my brother, my sister  are playing Pokemon on Nintendo, It is so much fun, I should play it too\". And when you matured, you want to try something weird, something different or you just keep sticking with what you have had from the childhood.\n\n  The third is more resonable, E-SPORT is the very new WORLD. Even in USA, \"What the f...reak is the e-sport. It is just a fucking TYPICAL computer game\". So, the second and the third are make sense now. Japanese need more time to deal with computer gaming especially e-sport. They almost do not having any experience in how to take control with e-sport, how to handle this freaking e-sport.\n\n  The last but not least and the most important thing. Making games is making bussines, and no profit - no bussines. And as I shown in \"the first, the second and the third\", making a console game is obviously more profit than making a e-sport game.\n\nThanks for reading this comment because my English is really really dumb. But, i hope it helps you guys can understand why Japan take so long to \"put it out\".","replies":[{"poster":"FogIsland","date":"2015-11-26T23:21:42.568+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"Your English look like \"Japanese English\".
