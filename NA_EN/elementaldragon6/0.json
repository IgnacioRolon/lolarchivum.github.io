For example, @sshole is best defined as irritating when not used as a body part.

That rule is \"Don't Be a Jerk\".  You were being a jerk. And it seems you did it often enough that you got banned.\n\nThat being said.

Then a 25-game restriction, and then a 14-day ban. If you don't get the hint by then and are still causing problems, the next punishment is a permaban. \n> \n> So had you only done what was showed in the chat logs posted, having never received a punishment by the system before? Certainly, these shouldn't have granted a permaban. None of this is bad enough to be skipping the lower punishments and jumping right to a permanent ban. It would have only been a 10-game chat restriction in this case. But, since you'd climbed through the punishment tiers already, you received a permaban.\n\nas far as i can recall, i never got a 2 week suspension on this account, so this perma ban business comes as a surprise to me.","replies":[{"poster":"Prandine","date":"2016-01-29T19:06:43.468+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's a known fact that Riot does in fact bump up accounts to 2-week or permaban status if the offenses in question are really, REALLY bad. If you're still confused about your ban then feel free to file a Support Ticket or ask Lyte on his ask.fm page about it. Since others have tried to explain to you why you got banned, I'll include the official Riot stances from [Understanding the Tribunal](http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=2726400): \n\n>**1) What's the point of having a language filter if I can get banned for 'adult' language?**\na) We aren't out to punish players who use adult language; in fact, very few players are ever banned for saying stuff like \"f***, I missed that skill shot\" or \"damn, f***ing close game!\" However, the language filter is not an excuse to verbally abuse someone in the game. When you verbally abuse or harass someone by calling them \"f***ing ******\" or \"n*gger noob\", that's when you've crossed the line and will be punished by the Tribunal. I've said this before and I'll say it again, we aren't trying to clean online games of adult language; we're trying to reform or get rid of jerks who like to verbally abuse and harass other players.\n\n\n>**4) That player in my game was far worse than me. Why am I banned???**\na) I'll keep this one simple: retaliation isn't OK. Reacting to a toxic player by being toxic just incites that player to be even worse--it also ruins the game for up to 8 other players. It is far, far worse to watch two people yelling at each other all game than it is to watch 1 player ranting into blank space. Almost everyone in the game can find someone out there that behaves worse than they do--but so what? Finding someone worse doesn't justify your behavior or justify retaliation. We expect more out of our players. What players often don't realize is... those other players in your game that you thought were worse? Nearly 100% of the time, those players were banned even before you were. If someone is being toxic, just report them and move on. If you retaliate, both of you will be banned. It's really that simple.","replies":[{"poster":"ElementalDragon6","date":"2016-01-29T19:10:03.653+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm familair with what used to b the tribunal, to bad that right now the tribunal is gone and we are left with an automatic system that is no where near close to represnting the tribunal of old.\n\ni also fail to see how the texts you qoute ( which i have read before on multiple occasions) have any relation with what is going on here.\nWhat i did does not fall under somehting being \"really REALLY bad\" so i dont know what to do with this, but thanks for posting and showing intrest anyways.","replies":[{"poster":"Prandine","date":"2016-01-29T19:21:22.142+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Keep in mind that all permaban cases are reviewed by a Riot employee, and they go through ones entire account history in order to determine if the account in question is deserving of a permanent ban or not.
