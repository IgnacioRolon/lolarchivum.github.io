You may need to roll it back to get those keys working again.  Double check any keyboard/mouse software you might be using too in case it's preventing your keys from binding.  I hope that helps!","replies":[]},{"poster":"bababach","date":"2017-05-13T21:43:06.316+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I has the same problem since patch 7.9.

I've been having the same problem too and when I look for support they gave me these instructions:\n\n\"Open Start Menu > Type \"Control Panel\" and Open it > Programs and Features > \nView Installed Updates (Top Left) > Search for KB4015583 > Right Click, Uninstall.\"\n\nThe other problem people are having is that some people have different file names so it's not a very efficient fix. Best solution is to rollback an update I'm sure.","replies":[]}]}]}
