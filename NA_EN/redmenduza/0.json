I get honor every couple to few days when I play, more so if i dominate or play support.  Just being friendly tends to have little effect unless everyone pretty much was average, and at that point it's a toss up.  Get matched with a premade?  Yea, your not getting any honor.  I finally had my chests down, but with the champ reset, im getting an s nearly every game, and im already capped.  \n\nMy real suspicion is that**_ riot does this to get people to buy keys_**.  There is little to do with actual honor.\n\nRiot should poll people to see if this is liked or disliked, because in my group of friends we hate it.  It forces us to honor each other, and ignore the actual game.  HATE being unable to honor opponents as well.","replies":[]}]}
