I know that normally you will ask me click the \"?\" mark and try to repair the game, but actually I already tried it and it doen't answer me (maybe because I reinstalled the game, and I need download some date first). \r\n\r\nI also got some problems that \"Bugsplatrc resource DLL not found\".\r\n\r\nDeeply hope you can reply soon.\r\n\r\nHappy holiday.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-28T02:50:19.317+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There may be missing assets in your League directory, specifically because you're getting Bugsplat resource errors. I recommend grabbing our [**Hextech Repair Tool**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367) to try a repatch. Simply load up the application and check the box for *Force Repatch* before hitting the **START** button. After the process finishes, launch League as admin by right-clicking on the shortcut and select *run as administrator*.\n\nLet me know if this resolved your issue. ^.^","replies":[{"poster":"Single Dog Horus","date":"2017-01-02T18:36:40.834+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately, this thing didn't work.
