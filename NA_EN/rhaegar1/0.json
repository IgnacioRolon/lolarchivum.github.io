I found YouTube video from July where it took guy 8 GB in total to download. \r\nI really need to know exact data amount, because I am using mobile internet to download it. \r\nAlso, does client resume download after interruption or downloads all over again? \r\n\r\nThanks a lot!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-16T20:44:55.422+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"You are likely going to run into issues trying to reach our patching servers through a mobile connection, and you would run the risk of using up data if it's interrupted.  The client would have to restart the installation, not pick up where it left off.  If at all possible, seek out a library or other venue that will offer service to get you installed.  You may have additional patches to download as well to ensure you're up to date.","replies":[]}]}
