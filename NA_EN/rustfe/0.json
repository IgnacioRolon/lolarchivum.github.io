When clicking on the shortcut the logo appears as normal but then vanishes. \nThe game had been functioning perfectly fine post update *7/21/16*\n\n_Technical information_\nNVIDIA GeForce GTX 560 Ti \nIntel(R) Core(TM) i7 CPU         960  @ 3.20GHz\nWindows 8\nNo security [is installed, but key ran out]- Living life on the edge \n\n_Situation/Symptoms_\nWhat I can see from task manager is the LoL Patcher (32 bit) and Riot Client Patcher (32 bit) running under the background tab. They are using solely Memory, no CPU, disk nor the network.\n-Yes I have used \"Run as administrator\" on the \"lol.Launcher.admin.exe\" and \"lol.Launcher.exe\"\n-I don't believe it is a networking issue, rather a program issue\n\nFollowing an uninstall, because I am unable to repair the game, resulted in the same outcome. However judging from a Reddit post (below) I feel I might be missing adobe air and proceed to do so in the manner of that below post but no luck. \n-The same thing processes in task manager occurred as above. \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1lps3z/if_client_is_not_starting_heres_the_fix_enjoy/\n\nI can't seem to find anything else on the interwebs but this [Below]- But it just ends? and I quite don't understand what his problem is. \nhttp://boards.eune.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support-en/38Y3sJuP-league-launcher-wont-open-after-trying-everything\n\n_Logs_\nI am not entirely sure what logs to share so\nhttp://pastebin.com/DgWepFUr\n[Launcher.Log\n](http://pastebin.com/DgWepFUr)\nhttp://pastebin.com/iKYpyzMv \n[LoLPatcher.log](http://pastebin.com/iKYpyzMv) [I had to cut off 3.4 of the darn thing but I think you can understand]\nhttp://pastebin.com/E1LEA1Pg\n[LoLPatcherUx.log](http://pastebin.com/E1LEA1Pg) [I see error messages- but I don't speak computer]\n\nR3d.Logs is just the line \"000000.000| ALWAYS| Logging started at 2016-07-22T20:30:49.736\"\n\nI don't think network log is needed. I am holding that back because of IP and other stuff I don't want to comb for and censor. Same goes for dxdiag file. \n\n_Other stuff_\nI am a first time forum poster, and fairly new to the league community- I tried to follow and read the rules/ If I had broke any of them including posting links plz no nuke me. \nAnything else that is need I will provide, and I am also updating this btw.\n\n\n--Much love, thanks. {{champion:106}}\n\n_Update1_\nI just got the \"BugSplatRC resource DLL was not found\" window then followed by \n\"LoLPatcher.exe - Application Error\" \"The Instruction at 0x004b6d1d referenced memory a 0x00000000. The memory could not be written.\"\n- This followed a 4 hour wait of the above processes ^^^ running. \n\n_Research_\nApparently this problem is not very common, thus I could not find any good solutions they include:\nReinstalling [Done]\nGoing into safe mode and enabling networking [Temp Fix] \nDownloading BugSplatRC.dll from some random website [Too risky]-\n\n_Update2_\nSo \"C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\RADS\\solutions\\lol_game_client_sln\\releases\\0.0.1.23\\deploy\" Does not in fact contain the BugSplatRC.dll, however a search has found BugSplatRc.dll, bugsplatrc.dll, bugsplat.dll, and BugSplat.dll all in \"C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\RADS\\projects\\lol_patcher\\releases\\0.0.0.63\\deploy\"\n  - Forum posts used [[1]](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/E1NHIh2U-cant-open-league-of-legend) [[2]](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report/YTYXWqNl-league-wont-open-after-clicking-launch-may-have-found-a-partial-solutionclue)\n\nAlso going through all of this and thinking about another reinstall and on the uninstall menu from windows 10 I find a duplicate of the game. The other one which I can not seem to remove is dubbed version 3.0.1, lacks an icon (the classic L), and has the install date of 7/22/2016 [Odd?]. The second one is dubbed 4.1.2 and is the one I have been using to remove before reinstalling. \n-Attempting to \"cleaning pc with software\"\n\n_I think this is a far as I can go, I am stumped_ \ndank logs and googling is sure to attract some reds\n\n_Update 3_\nI tried to remove the duplicate copy of the game with the tool from microsoft- https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17588/fix-problems-that-block-programs-from-being-installed-or-removed - and now a bunch of folders are missing in the Riot folder (after a reinstall) and not a single process is running in the background. The logo just appears and disappears. I tried do a force repatch with the HRT, but the folders were still missing. \n","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-23T15:20:54.747+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for providing these details, and your patience while troubleshooting.  I'm glad you reached out to us; now we can join your party and help too! :D  \n\nWith the information and error messages you've provided here, it really sounds like there is a setting with your OS or some program that is  preventing the patcher from launching.  You mentioned that you were unable to run a repair, was there any particular reason?    Your patcher may have also become corrupt due to all of the adjustments that have been made so far.  There are a few routes we can take to get this fixed up, and start a clean slate.  \n\nAs a first step, go over our [Patching Issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202969434-Patching-Issues) guide and complete each set of instructions.  These instructions will include re-patching and repairing files which will be important if your issue doesn't get fixed up here.\n\nYou can also use run [Hextech Repair Tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752674-Network-System-and-League-of-Legends-Logs) which can automatically fix up some issues, run repairs, and obtain a set of necessary logs as we move forward.\n\nLet me know how this works out for you, I'll be around!","replies":[{"poster":"Rustfe","date":"2016-07-24T06:17:13.312+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"_Results of following the guide_\n1. Refresh Rate- Does not work; reset back to 120 Hz\n\n2. Resetting \"winsock\"- Created a whole new set of issues. My bigfoot network manager now tells me at each start up that \"LSP not map correctly, do you want to remap?\" Hitting no is the only way I can access the in internet. Hitting yes meant no internet connection or as the game error message says \"Could not connect to an HTTP Server. Check internet connection and firewall etc.\" Well I do have a connection on other devices through wifi and lan. The warning from the network manager would not stop even after 2 restarts.  I feel that this has created a host of other problems with other applications... \n\n3.Run Game as administrator- Done, I have also tried starting from the .admin.exe launcher as well with/out run game as administrator.\n\n4.Force repatch- C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\RADS\\projects\\lol_air_client\\releases\\{highest version number} was missing entirely, keeping in mind I just \"tried\" to do a reinstall (^above^). I do delete C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\RADS\\projects\\lol_launcher and tried it again, no luck. I notice a surge in memory usage, a touch of cpu, and for a fraction of a second network usage. I do not attempt to restore the file back, and continue onwards.\n\n5.Repair- I can't even get to that UI\n\n6.Disable UAC- I am on an admin account\n\n7.Temporary Disable firewall- Done, no luck. I also tried adding exceptions in allowing the league.exe launcher on my desktop to connect from private and public network. No luck I undo any changes. \n\n8.Installing NET FrameWork 3.5- I download it from the link, and it would not install. The reading the instruction it requires me to install \"Windows installer 3.1 v2\", however \"Windows XP is no longer supported\" and \"your system is 64 bit.\" I get the recommended \"Windows Installer 3.1 Redistributable (v2)\" and when installing get the message \"not enough storage.\" I have 429 GB free on my local disk (not storage partition).... Without a clue, I give up this possible solution. \n\n9.Change to a wire connection: I always had a lan connection. \n\n_Running Hextech Repair Tool_\nFirst I had it just do a repatch, with add firewall exceptions. Launched the game again no luck.\n\nSecond time around I hit the reinstall + disable firewall, again no luck. I think the logs from the first go got nuked. \n\n__I got the zip folder of logs here but not too sure how I can get it to you- Slight concern about the network logs and stuff in there. __\n\n_A little later......._\n\n_Window restore to post update_\nI hit next, then I was then asked to do a disk check, so the PC restarts and does the disk check, but then goes in the dskcheck cycle of death. I then thought the only way to end it was to do a reset of my pc or attempt a restore. The restore file turned out to be \"corrupted\" so, I decide to give up after 4 hours of it and left my pc on for another 4 hours and it somehow booted into windows. I had a windows cleaner tool turn off disk check every restart, and did a manual dskcheck through CMD. I did not see errors with directories relating to league, just mod files from steam games. I am pretty confident my hard drive is mostly free of corrupted files.

But I will give the Hextech Repair Tool a go. \n\nI will also try out the guide as well.","replies":[]}]}]}
