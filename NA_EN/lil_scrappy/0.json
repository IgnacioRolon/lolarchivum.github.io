I&#039;ve dedicated a lot of my time to this game and have spent many seasons learning and climbing in ranked to try to become a much better player and be as competitive as possible. I realize that toxic behavior should be punishable and my ban is definitely justified I just wanted to write a post about my experience with league of legends and riot as a company. I feel as you grow as a player in league of legends sometimes the competition gets the best of you mentally and sometimes you respond to people in a way you wouldn&#039;t normally. Once again I understand excessive mature language and being overall toxic is bad for the game I just don&#039;t understand how people get so frustrated in this game and report so frequently that it can end in a permanent termination of somebodies account. I know this might be a little off topic but I remember the days of WC3 and Diablo 2 and you could say literally whatever you wanted in those games and you would never get banned for language, they were mature video games meant for mature players (minus WC3 I guess).\r\n\r\nI have enjoyed my time here playing league of legends and I&#039;ve met many different people from all over the world who love to play this game. I think Riot as a company is a little greedy and not very forgiving but it is their game and their company so they can choose to run it how they please. I&#039;ve spent over $2000 on this game, unlocked every champion, climbed to Diamond multiple times and overall grown a lot as a player and gamer from playing this game. I will not be making a new account simply because it costs too much money to do so and takes way too much time to unlock everything again. I would just like to say Goodbye forever Riot and so long to the league community I had a blast while I was here and I wish everyone the best playing experience you can have and hopefully you enjoy it a little bit more with me being gone.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m down to answer any questions you guys might have about my experience with the game or toxicity in the league community if you guys are open for a discussion.","replies":[{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2016-08-01T20:36:30.817+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"question:\n\ndid you skip reading through your 14-day email to know that your next punishment is a permaban?\n\nor were you treading carefully and didn't realise that minor stuff can get you punished as well?","replies":[{"poster":"Lil Scrappy","date":"2016-08-02T03:13:01.689+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't remember getting an email to be completely honest, second of all If I read that my next punishment was a perma ban and I knew that for 100% I definitely would've just /muteall as soon as I got into a game.","replies":[{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2016-08-02T03:20:50.735+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hmm.. while it is possible to skip punishment tiers with extreme toxicity, typically toxicity bans start with a 14-day ban instead of perma.\n\nIf you haven't gotten a 14-day ban, you might want to ask support.riotgames.com (under general game questions -> account management or something like that) when your 14-day ban was (date).\n\nYou might be able to get you ban status to a 14-day ban instead of perma.","replies":[{"poster":"Lil Scrappy","date":"2016-08-02T03:24:16.961+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No I definitely received a 14 day ban prior I just don't remember getting the email saying that my next report or next punishment would be a perma ban. I already tried contacting riot support to see if I could get another 14 day or something of the sort, really anything I would do at this point to get my account back but they told me I was too toxic of a player and my ban was justified. Which I understand just once again very disappointed in myself that I would throw away 6 years of work and literally thousands of dollars that quickly.

While it's still more common to get a teammate calling you a tard I've had more than a few games lately where I do get the benefit of the doubt for having a bad game.  Communication is difficult when one or both parties do not have a fluent way of expressing ideas over text medium.  More often than not text is simply to blunt if all someone has to work with is a handful of common words.
