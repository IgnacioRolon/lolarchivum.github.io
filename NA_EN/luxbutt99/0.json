I can play against them 1v2 in lane, no problem. It's not fun, but it's perfectly doable. I suppose \"Beginner\" level is the lowest? This one is so utterly boring when you know how to play, I don't even want to touch it.\n\nBots have indeed good accuracy and pathing. On builds, I'm more skeptical, but I can believe real players are even worse in low MMR. But they have also a ton of glaring issues that no real player, even in low Iron, have.\n\nBiggest one is, they have absolutely zero notion of commitment. If they are close to dying, they back away, even if their opponent is ALSO close to dying. They are also very bad at pushing their advantage and exploiting opportunities after killing someone. They don't push towers well, they don't group properly, they never take Baron or Dragon.\n\nA full team of Iron5 players can probably lose *some* games against Beginner bots, but it won't be a \"pubstomp\", and I'd be amazed if real humans could get a lower than 50% winrate against bots. But anyway, what's the likelihood of people getting a full team of low Iron players in the first place?","replies":[{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2019-07-16T15:15:26.619+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thatâ€™s probably just due to coding.

That is the main reason players only send one person top lane, if the single person that is against the 2 has a chance to out level them because they aren't sharing exp then they just win. Usually you can beat them at level 3-4 ish but if you are new you might want to wait till 6 for your ult. \n\nAlso, they may try to dive under your turret, if they do just use a stun or snare or some other cc and often they will just die or have to go back giving you breathing room.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zero Shingetsu","date":"2019-07-16T10:53:40.038+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=LuxButt99,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=58l39xHb,comment-id=0001000000000000,timestamp=2019-07-16T10:46:32.563+0000)\n>\n> the lux bot is a real sniper\n> lmao guess we'll never know since i am one of the few people who actually play this mode\n\nI used to, but then they changed LeBlanc.
