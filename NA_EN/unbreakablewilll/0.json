It was a pretty iconic ability in Veigar's skill set. When used properly, it has little counter play as it is instant, and serves to set up the rest of Veigar's combo. By introducing a delay to the ability, you add counter play, but also really screw up a big part of his kit and identity.\r\n\r\nSo here's my proposal: Make event horizon instant for the first target it hits, and if it his multiple target, the champ whose center is closest to the horizon gets locked down. After the first target, the spell continues to charge up for .75 or .5 secs or whatever before coming into full effect. This effectively stops Veigar from instantly locking up an entire team with a non ult ability, yet still allowing good Veigars to snag the target they are aiming for. Veigar was meant to be a single target burst mage anyway, this will add to the theme while still allowing sufficient counter play. What do you guys think?\r\n\r\nTL:DR - Let Veigars stun be instant on the first target it comes into contact with while still having to charge up to stun any more targets.","replies":[{"poster":"ModelT","date":"2015-03-25T21:28:54.128+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the point of the nerf relates to some of the stuff Riot has been working on fixing this last season or so, and that is simple, easy, long range hard CCs with little to no draw back are being systematically removed.   A key example of this is the Sion rework.  His old Q was a powerful stun on a targeted effect.  0% counter play.  Most hard CC basic abilities need to either fully engage into melee or have some sort of spell counter play options.\n\nThat being said, the skill curve on Viegar just shot up a bit with the \"nerf\".  The ability to use Event Horizon well does precisely what your post title proclaims, with good Veigars being able to farm their Q up well, being able to counter AP champs like an end boss, and amazing Veigars able to more accurately land their event horizon.\n\nI'm gonna say it's a pretty good nerf, since it no longer allows Veigar to, at max range, quick stun somebody who in all rights probably successfully escaped a fight w/ Veigar, with little other draw back.  Most players will waste their flash ability to escape the cage, even during the cast delay, which is a great success, all things considered.","replies":[{"poster":"AhShark","date":"2015-03-26T00:04:00.194+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"From a Veigar main who cried a little at the nerf before actually testing it out, i have to agree with what you just said. An instant hard CC is unfair to everyone no matter how fun it was. An E that could win teamfights really was over the top. However i do believe they should add a slow similar to Victors stun cage thing, even if its as minor as 10%.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lord Malice","date":"2015-03-26T19:42:33.383+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So we only should have tactical counters in the game and not strategic ones?  Saying that Veigar's old stun had no counter play is completely false.  You could build Tenacity, this reduced the length of the stun thus allowing you time to move before Dark matter landed, negating 1/3 of the damage potential.  You could buy a Banshees.  You could buy a QSS.  \n\nYet without his stun being a reliable escape or engage tool I guarantee that you will never see him played competitively again, not that he had much of that anyways.  And true, pro play should not be a reason to buff/nerf or not to buff/nerf a champ, but let's be honest, as soon as Veigar started seeing play as a support competitively his days were numbered.  I can't honestly say that I've seen a \"Veigar Op and Toxic fix now!! etc. etc.\" thread before his foray into the pro scene as a support mage. So clearly it wasn't as broken as it is being made out to be.","replies":[]}]}
