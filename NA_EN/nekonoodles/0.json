I click to move my champ and my champ wont move yet I can still see everything around me including when i get jumped on and murdered. I have actually DCd a few times as well for maybe 5 minutes or less at a time. When i reconnect I still have the same issues. 2 other players in my last match complained about the same issue so I know its not just me.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-27T15:45:50.240+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your internet might be fine, but your network sounds like it's unstable at least specifically to the game server.
