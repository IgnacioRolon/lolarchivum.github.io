I have 900k mastery points on him and I'm consistently active in the Kench Subreddit and Discord discussing how/why Tahm is either over-tuned or under-tuned.\n\nRiot, Tahm Kench will literally be unplayable.  An 11% nerf to HP at level 1, for a 1% gain to HP at level 18?  11% is 2 auto attacks worth of HP at level 1 for champions with _**zero**_ items.  1% gain is not even a quarter of an auto-attack at level 18 from anything other than Karthus, in most instances it's less than a quarter of the damage a 6 item ADC would do!  Tahm Kench will literally never be picked in solo queue and this _**still**_ won't solve his pick/ban status in Competitive play.\n\nYou want Kench to be balanced and see play in solo queue while limiting his impact on Competitive?  Nerf the cooldown on his ultimate -- make it 180/160/140 seconds at rank 1/2/3, while increasing the range by 1000 at all ranks.  Revert the CD to 6 seconds on Q.  This will balance Tahm around his ability to out-macro (one of the primary reasons he's picked in competitive).  Either that or re-work his ultimate completely.\n\nKench relies heavily on HP, more so than Braum -- who has a dash, a wall/shield, and a hard engage ultimate, and a Q that allows allies to apply towards stacks and stun -- Kench has a sometimes reliable ultimate that falls off significantly in late game play, no dash and no hard CC.  Kench is pick ban for a single ability in pro play with a 47% winrate in soloqueue.  \n\nYou've already doubled the CD on W when used on allies, and it's broken half the time (where if you use it on something other than an ally that dies mid-animation, it still gets hit with the FULL cooldown).  The base HP nerf will affect Tahm much harder than it will affect Braum.  Tahm cannot E-shield at 50 HP remaining and block 600 damage.  Braum can Wall at 50 HP remaining and block 600 damage for himself as well as an ally.  Tahm has no dash.  Braum can dash.  Tahm has no combat ultimate.  Braum has a combat ultimate.\n\nYou are comparing a 50% win rate Braum (AFTER his baseline nerf from last patch which you _**directly reference as a comparison for the reason to nerf Tahm this patch**_) to a 47% win rate Tahm Kench -- _**Before this nerf even goes into effect!**_\n\nRiot you are literally going to make Tahm Kench unplayable after this nerf.  He's already the _**LOWEST**_ win rate support for ALL regions in Platinum+ Elo, and you are _**NERFING HIM AGAIN**_.\n\n> Tahm Kench\n> Base HP down; HP per level up.\n> \n> Similar to Braum last patch, we’re looking to drain some of Tahm Kench’s baseline sturdiness. Reducing Tahm’s base HP should make him rely more on his defensive tools to find success in lane, while increasing his HP gained per level will make it slightly easier for him to wade into the enemy team late game.\n> Base Stats\n> HEALTH 610 ⇒ 540\n> HEALTH GROWTH 95 ⇒ 102\n> W - Devour\n> BUGFIX Allies Tahm Kench has devoured will no longer sometimes be targetable when first swallowed.","replies":[{"poster":"Dope Solo","date":"2018-09-26T00:35:42.400+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":4,"body":"A 21% drop in revenue over the last year?

Ok. Who is most popular streamer on twitch. Tyler. Why? Because he plays Draven, a mechanically instensive and flashy champion. Who is next Qtpie. Why? Because he can consistently play different mechanically instensive champions with flashy plays. Who is most picked champion? Lee sin. Why? Because he is mechanically intensive flashy champion. What champion class is least picked despite being over powered? Tanks. WHY? BECAUSE THEY ARE FUCKING BORING. Tanks are fucking boring. This statement is also subjective.

Are you one of those who think that flashy plays means that you're skilled?\n\nDid I say anything about skill? But sure lets go to skill territory shall we. Tahm kench currently is almost fully immobile tank that scales on all of his abilities with MAX hp. This means that his Q with very forgiving hitbox scales from defensive stats and also has incredible base damage just like any other tank. His W that already deals good portion of max hp damage as base damage also scales from his defensive stats. His E and R and utility. If you trade with tahm kecn, win trade or even kill him before first back, you didnt win lane, you just slowed him down. When you come back with long sword or anything offensive and he comes back with ruby crystal, not only he has 150 more hp to trade with you, also amplifying his E, he also deals roughly as much damage as you do. You bought item for offense and got more offensive stats. He bought item for defense and got defense and offense. Makes sense doesnt it? But wait it gets better. Best way of dealing with tanks is fighting in small bursts because generally they are slow and cant retaliate. What does tahm kench do after loosing such a trade? He heals back up. So you have to all in him. Now there are few champions that can all in kench consistently without any trouble such as Darius, Fiora, and maybe ranged champs. However these champions are HIGHLY susceptible to ganks. And tahm kench makes it EVEN BETTER. Tahm kench has literally 0 counterplay on lane past plat 3 because any competent jungler knows that ganking him is waste of time and ganking for him are free kills. And what does he trade for such an incredible laning phase? Mobility. What does Darius trade for 46% win rate and oppressive laning phase?

There were no top laners leaving top lane and quitting the game because they couldnt play 3 out of 4 viable champion classes on top lane. There was literally noone complaining and still is noone complaining about how boring laning againist tanks is. I guess thats just my imagination. Support totaly wasnt picked more than top lane until recently. \n\n>Either way the tanks I've mentioned are all about that.

Sure there is fun to be had in disrupting enemies. Have you ever played adc and got stun locked for 3.5 seconds though? I am going to tell you waht is more annoying than any Rengar, any leblanc, any zed. It is the inability to do ANYTHING. What makes players smash their monitors more than failing? LAG. What is CC? Essentially A FUCKING LAG. You are all talking like you have never been morgana snared. Now imagine that, but constantly on top lane for whole god damn laning phase and on top of that most of the time its not even skillshot. Every 10 seconds you are unable to move for 1 up to 2.5 seconds. Oneshotting is boring but CC locking in pvp game is straight up infuriating.\n\n>I find a decent amount of satisfaction from playing Leona to stop people jumping my ADC, and plenty as Ornn from hitting teams with my CC.\n\nI think you do not remember the times when leona was most banned support in the game. And not necessarily because she was strong, she falls off harder lategame than any tank now and that was during time when lategame was relevant. It was the stunlocking potential she had. NOONE WANTS TO PLAY AGAINST STUNLOCKS.\n\n>Plenty of fun to be had. But like you said, it's all the flashy playmakers now, and that's why we have this meta.\n\nNo, LCS meta is still a tank meta. Every single fucking game 6 tanks. High elo meta is different only because people do not want to play tanks. If you took any 5 member team and had them play ranked flex it will turn into tank fiesta very fucking fast.","replies":[{"poster":"Besteal","date":"2018-09-27T15:24:38.782+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are complaints in every meta.\n\nIf you want to do that go ahead.

Sit down and think a little about that statement. One of the lanes with biggest champion pools giving opportunity to most diverse set of people enjoy the lane, was picked less than a role that is made for healers from MMOs, for medics from TF2, for Mercies from overwatch... A top was picked less than least popular role in every single multi player game pvp game. Thats how bad tank metas are. Are people quitting mid because of assassins? No because they can still choose to not deal with them. You can roam to other lanes and win the game that way. You cannot roam as top lane. Only lane to roam is mid and since there is only one way you can gank it, you are going to fail. You cant teleport to bot and win fight that way because either opposing tank will stop your TP, or he will follow you and do more than you with easier kit and cheaper build. CURRENTLY playing top does not feel so impactless when you play anything that isnt tank because you can actually win laning phase. Which still doesnt guarantee your team fight phase because all tanks poses high base damages making their damage relevant no matter how much behind they are. Their engage tools are better than any fighter than any diver than any assassin than any ranged top lane, so unless you are 9 1 oneshotting their carry, tank is gona fuck you over in teamfights anyway. Tank metas may not have such loud complains like assassin metas, because when assassins are meta they are played ALL THE FUCKING TIME, tank metas have insane gameplay issues. They are forcing only two classes of champions. Tanks and anti tanks. Games do not only get stale and boring, they are so uninteractive and predictable riot literally had to break season 5 LCS to stop people from leaving their tank fiesta games. Noone wants to watch that shit, noone wants to play that shit(and no you will never ever convince me that out of 120+ champions your most enjoyable pick is a tank) and noone wants to play against that shit. Tanks are flawed PvE class that has nothing to do in pvp games and in order to make them work and popular you HAVE TO BREAK THEM. And the sole reason for that is very nature of competitive Pvp gaming. No you dont want to be warden of your allies. No you dont want to be their shield. That isnt fun. Riot knows that it isnt fun for 90% of players thats why they buffed their damage time and time again. And please, just please tell me that \"All I want is for tanks to get better at tanking\". That is not going to achieve jack shit. If your damage isnt threat and your CC isnt threat, you are useless and ignored. Because unlike npcs in MMOs where tanks fucking belong, players tend to have functional brains.\n\n> If you want to do that go ahead. Have fun getting wrecked when your W is on cooldown.\n\nOh so you are assuming that im stupid enough to trade with my enemy with my cooldowns up. Thanks mate really for assuming that im actually mentally challenged. Welcome to platinum 3 elo where players would rather skip whole wave of gold than loose 100 hp pre level 9.\n\n> Yes.\n \nIf ornns ult is skillshot then Namis ult is skillshot. If Ornns pillar is skillshot then Dariuses pull is a skillshot, and if god forbid you think that his W is a skillshot on lane where 70% of picks are full melee and 50% of them have no or very little mobility then I actually do not respect your opinions from now on.\n\n> If you got locked down, then you are dead before 3.5 seconds are up in this meta anyway. \n\nAnd again completely ignoring laning phase. Or I guess laning phase is irrelevant to tank mains because they are used to afking under tower for 15 minutes and then fun starts.\n\n>You're probably out with your QSS or your support's Mikaels anyway. \n\nYeah right because crit adcs can totaly slot that Qss in build in mid game instead of infinity edge totaly plausible. And mikaels? I havent seen that item for months.\n\n>Or you know, with half of the adc's having self peel you won't get locked down anyway. \n\nLike who? {{champion:51}} her dash can be canceled with stun and snare.

Ill show you. {{champion:25}}  one of the most hated supports because of her single skillshot ability capable of snaring enemy for 2.5 seconds with travel speeds slower than ugandas internet is sitting on low base hp, has 0 defensive scalling abilities and if she wants to go into fight and actually use her ultimate ability she needs to invest into 2.9k gold item that doesnt even fit her role when supporting.\n\n{{champion:32}}  has higher base damages, higher base health and scale, higher range on his Q, higher travel speed, even if he hits minion in vicinity of his target he can still capitalize on that with his R, has innate damage reduction scalling with items HE BUILDS ANYWAY and his ult has instant same effect with larger scale and he doesnt have to dance around enemy team for whole duration of it.\n\n{{champion:31}} same base damages and scalings as amumu, his Q is AoE, even if its \"harder\" to land than her Q, it is compensated with its potential to affect more than 1 enemy, has innate hp scalling from his ult which scales his ultimates ability damage, has innate lane sustain on unit kills of enemy team and has silence for 2 seconds making retaliation against him impossible. \n\n{{champion:3}} Has much higher base damages, AoE taunt capable of affecting entire team, he gets free non skill based magic shield scaling from magic resist he is building ANYWAY, poses mobility and CC and acts as pseudo shen capable of turning any fight around.\n\n{{champion:79}} Has higher base damages, scallings blah blah im gona leave this part out because all tanks have higher base stats than any champion in the game, poses AoE slow, AoE knock up, damage reduction and AoE knock back that can be utilized in multiple ways. Scales from ap but is not squishy for building full ap in any way compared to paper morgana that gets oneshot by slight breeze making her ult completely unusable.\n\n{{champion:89}} This is only tank in the game I consider fair. Her damage isnt high enough to oneshot anything at any part of the game, is capable of stunlocking unexperienced players and punishing people out of position with clear indication of engage. No bullshit from the skies gallio, no broken hitbox of graggas, no 5 man ult from amumu. She actually has to hit her abilities to do anything relevant.\n\n{{champion:54}} His Q combined with comet and manaflow band is gona push you out of the lane, it isnt skillshot, there is no counterplay to it. Gets free armor before every trade, his W gives him free stats for building them, his E damage scales from armor which he builds ANYWAY. His ult is unavoidable dash ability if you dont have flash, capable of knocking up multiple targets at once, and all he has to do for it is flash so noone expects it. No indications of engage, no counterplay, nothing. You can push morgana away, you can kill her before she stuns, you can cleanse stun. You cant push him away because he is unstoppable, you wont kill him because its malphite and you wont kill him because not even season 7 adc could oneshot ulting malphite before he landed. And you cant cleanse knock up.\n\n{{champion:57}} High damage, innate sustain that scales with number of enemies he is facing, untargetable dash snare with %max hp damage, traps and area of denial ultimate he can use no matter how bad he is built or how bad he is played. 0 skill is required to deny enemy jungler baron steal if you throw this ability in his direction.\n\nAnd the list goes on and on. Morgana compared to these champions suddenly sounds like a fucking heaven.\n\n>Same feeling when an ADC kites you to death or 3 hits you.\n\nThis doesnt happen anymore. No need for tanks to be so tanky anymore too.\n\n> No. You don't. But I want you in one when I face you. You want me in one when you face me. Someone has the ability to do it.\n\nWHAT??\n\n> Hardly. LCS just understands the value of well balanced teams. \n\nIf LCS was about balanced teams huni would play riven not maokai. You would not put your star player on champion he doesnt want to play for sake of balance. You can go Gallio mid tank jungler and put Huni on carry. But no, LCS is about tanks and was about tanks for years. They have base damages on part with fully built divers, simpler kits and braindead engages. Tanks have no competition when it comes to top lane and wanting to win.\n\n>Unlike SoloQ. Same for people in Flex. In SoloQ people just like killing. \n\noh wow no shit.
