The match had 41 kills in total. But most of them came at the end. Was trying my ass off for the last token and had a truly S worthy score but still got an S-. Could this be the system hating me or have something to do with the work you were doing that night on EUNE. It said something along the lines of. Champion progression will not be available,we are checking up on mastery progression. Here's the match for reference.

Essentially the work was being done so that all of the old mastery mechanics would be carried over correctly to the new Honor System, but you were still able to get S's since you did get an S-.","replies":[{"poster":"sakwoya","date":"2017-06-30T10:23:38.746+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the speedy reply.","replies":[]},{"poster":"World Ender","date":"2017-06-30T01:31:02.429+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have a somewhat related question. This season I have noticed that sometimes my grades for champions do not update. For example, I've played one Shyvana game this season, on May 11 specifically (I'm looking at this match now) which lasted about 30 minutes, and I didn't AFK or leave or anything like that. Yet, when I go to my Collection tab, it says that my highest grade is N/A, implying that I haven't played her.\n\nA similar thing happened with Aatrox, where I earned an S+ on him in addition to some S and S-, but the highest grade that shows up is a plain S. \n\nWhat's up with this? Not that I really care about what grade is displayed, I'm just more curious about how a system like match history can keep track of every minion kill but the mastery system loses ranks (and in my case, frequently it seems).","replies":[]}]}]}
