So I delete some stuff and and I then move league to my second driver and reinstall the game(All 12.7 gigabytes of league) Then I unnsinstall league and reinstall it. I then get the standard 2 gigabyte update and halfway through it says unspecified error. I retry again and it's a 5 gigabyte patch download. I start download the patch again and it says unspecified error and I retry. It then says I have a 6 gigabyte patch to download and now my second driver went from having 16 gigs of space to have 3 MB of free space.\r\nHelp is required.","replies":[{"poster":"BoomBoomPaaw","date":"2017-01-25T20:22:45.589+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have the same error and it stops at 33% with 64 files scanned","replies":[]},{"poster":"MinnieDoBuuh","date":"2017-01-25T14:41:00.724+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's my 4th time patching this damn game.

Repairing will not do anything in this case because the issue is a block in your connection reaching our patching servers and not your game files.

The unspecified error can occur for a few reasons like connection trouble or permissions.  We can get a better idea of your specific issue by knowing at what % you're getting the error.  Make sure you have enough space, slow down on the reinstalls, and let me know!","replies":[{"poster":"RealDqni","date":"2017-01-25T20:39:45.991+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's NOT the connection boy.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Carbbit","date":"2017-01-25T14:22:25.066+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same Here , Unspecified Error Occurred , i get that 5 times by now , i tried hextech repair tool for the repatch option , repatched 2 gb for the 1/2 first sequence and the 2nd one , after that at the \"Calculating Differences / Files Scanned at 100 or smthing either on 50 the error ocurrs .","replies":[]}]}
