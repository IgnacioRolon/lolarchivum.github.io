I'm not 100% sure of the upload speed needed for League but I'd recommend testing your new internet in a custom or practice match once you get all moved! If you do have some problems, a hardwired connection will give you a better upload so you could try that out.","replies":[{"poster":"Ipols","date":"2017-06-05T22:42:51.502+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi\nUnfortunately I won't be able to test LoL untill I'm moved,guess I'll have to hope it's enough.
