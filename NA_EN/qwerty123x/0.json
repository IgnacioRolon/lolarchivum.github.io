So why remove mana potions which was an iconic item in the game from s1 to 5.22 and then bring them back but as a rare item only for Kleptomancy? What are you guys smoking? \r\n\r\nWhy remove a piece of League of Legends history then restore it for a new rune only, it should be able to be brought in the shop like health potion. Every MOBA and RPG game have health potions and mana potions but not this game, this game tries to be different every fucking time.\r\n\r\nWhat I want to see is to go back to how it was after patch 3.6, where health potions cost 25g and mana potions 25g but limited to 5 each in inventory. For you veterans, you will understand what I&#039;m talking about.","replies":[]}
