Opinions?","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":70,"down_votes":35,"body":"Right now, if a Fizz ults and hit somebody, the  shark latches on to them and they take the damage, but in a past change they changed the Fizz ult that if he missed, the shark will be on the ground and it cannot be latched onto a target but if they still stand on top of it they take the damage which is a healthy change, it offers counterplay. It forces the Fizz to aim better to make sure the shark hits somebody directly or the Fizz risks his ultimate dealing no damage.\r\n\r\nBut this ain&#039;t the case with a Zoe E. First of all, a Zoe E is faster than a Fizz ult in speed, it can also travel continuosly over the same piece of terrain which a Fizz ult cannot and even if she misses the E, there is a zoning field that no one can walk over for 4 seconds or else they get put to sleep which is ridiculous and this is what I want changed.\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\nIf Zoe hits her E and it hits someone directly fair enough, but if she misses her E allow enemy champions to walk over the field for 3 seconds, only the last second of the field will sleep the enemy target, change the color of the field on the last second to let enemy champions know this is a sleep zone, you will be put to sleep if you are still stood over it. This offers counterplay and allows enemy champions some breathing room.\r\n\r\nWhy:\r\nIt gives Zoe&#039;s E more skill to hit directly, or she risks not putting anybody to sleep. She has to rely on her teammates with slows and stuns to keep enemy champions on top of the sleep zone so she can chain their CC with her own for her full damage combo.\r\nHer E should be a reward for being a skillful player because right now, any Zoe player can make any enemy champion go to sleep even if they have bad skillshot cos of the zone that offers no counterplay.\r\n\r\nWhat do you guys think?","replies":[{"poster":"NocturnalSheild","date":"2018-01-05T16:17:08.106+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":26,"body":"3 seconds of counterplsy is insane.\n\nHow about the 1st second cant sleep and the last 3 can.","replies":[{"poster":"Andrey0345","date":"2018-01-05T16:36:42.191+0000","up_votes":47,"down_votes":11,"body":"> 3 seconds of counterplsy is insane.\n\nShe shouldn't have missed it.

Once you dodge the projectile for the E I have no sympathy for you if you get hit by the bubble because it doesn't even go on the ground instantly. It's like Kat's daggers.

I'd rather just see her sleep bubble move slower and/or get a higher cooldown.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sun Wu Ryuumoku","date":"2018-01-06T12:53:33.098+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They should already start by giving her so cd  and reduce her damages. I played against her a few day ago, was mid with Wukong, she failed all her spells, so i decided to go her and punish her... what a mistake !!! i lost most of my 2/3 of my hp.","replies":[]},{"poster":"VoraciousX","date":"2018-01-06T07:55:23.259+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't understand people complaining about the trap field. If it missed you, then unless you walk back into it, or are already in it's zone of influence, then you cannot be put to sleep. The problem is there isn't room enough to trade with her because it has a reset mechanic(a crappy one honestly) if she hits, and when it doesn't hit it's not that big of a difference when she already has CDR. They need to just increase the base cooldown and increase the reset mechanic to where it's shorter than previously. Good Zoe's will be rewarded, bad ones will have a large open window to be traded with.","replies":[]}]}
