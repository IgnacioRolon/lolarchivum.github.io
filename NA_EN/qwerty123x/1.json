A champion that's under the radar from most people's eyes, they won't realise that this champion has a toxic kit and is unhealthy for this game.\n\nLiterally cannot lane top against this champion. Pushes you into tower from level 1 with Q or W. While you are farming under tower, he spams Q or E for more damage and since his E amplifies his damage by 20% you take a lot of damage. And when he hits level 6 with a Catalyst, you may as well stand in fountain because you have lost the game. \n\nGrievous Wounds does nothing to combat against his ultimate or Swain in general because GW only reduces his healing not the damage he can do with E + R. Even if you use GW, he will most likely build a Spirit Visage unless he goes full AP. He doesn&#039;t face mana issues cos Manaflow Band and Catalyst giving him infinite mana sustain just as long as the enemy champion is attacking him, or he restores health back if he uses his mana, synergises with his ult. \n\nHe counters every melee champion in lane and in game. He makes melee champions useless the entire game. You can&#039;t kill him 1v1 because he does ridiculous damage as an AP tank. You can&#039;t team fight and kill him because all he does is runs into the middle of your team with ult on and Zhonya&#039;s, which gives him health back while invulnerable which makes no fucking sense. If you get hit by his E + W + Q, you are fucked. The Q damage at rank 5 with E applied deals 800 (+240%AP), and cos you are stunned, you are pretty much taking the full damage. If you manage to survive all that, there is an item that&#039;s called Rylai&#039;s Crystal Scepter, while makes his ult and E slow you down also. And if you stack magic resist, he can still buy Liandry&#039;s Torment and/or Void Staff to make your MR invalid.\n\nAll while he is enjoying a 50%+ winrate in Platinum and above since his release date. One champion should not be able to make all 74 melee champions completely invalid throughout the game. \n\nThat is fucking bullshit.
