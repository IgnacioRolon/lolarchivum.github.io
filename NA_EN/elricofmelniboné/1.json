Chromas do not have unique artwork on the loading screen. The distinguishing factor on the loading screen is the name - it'll read 'Dragonslayer Vayne Chaos', as opposed to just 'Dragonslayer Vayne'.\n\nIs the proper chroma showing up in game?","replies":[{"poster":"ElricOfMelniboné","date":"2015-12-07T19:50:51.261+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No it hasn't,I will check again today to see if it has changed","replies":[]}]}]}
