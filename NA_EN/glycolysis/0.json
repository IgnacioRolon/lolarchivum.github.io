The second game I tried to play went through Champion Select and the load screen just fine, but once I got onto Summoners Rift, the game froze, along with the rest of my computer. Thinking it was a freak thing, I had to manually power off the PC and tried a new game. Same thing happened (and now I have a 20 minute queue penalty). Since then I went to the repair tool, then tried uninstalling/reinstalling and that did not fix it. I even just swept the whole computer and updated all drivers and it still did not fix this. I have now been testing in custom games and it does the same thing on the other maps as well. It is strange that it was fine one game and now doesnt work. Can't play anymore:/","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-08T15:11:55.794+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have you recently updated Windows 10?  There's been an issue with the xbox game bar that's been causing some players to freeze like this.  I suggest disabling the [Xbox Game Bar ](http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8637-game-bar-turn-off-windows-10-a.html) as your first step to fix this up.
