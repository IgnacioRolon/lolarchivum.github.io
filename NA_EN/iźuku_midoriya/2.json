I am here to talk about Jhin.  The one, the only, Jhin.  Now I am just going to come out and say it that Jhin needs nerfs.  He sits at around a 15% play rate meaning he is in about 1-2 games out of 10 each time.  Each time he becomes this either snowballing monster out of lane due to his high synergy with items and runes/masteries right now OR he falls behind and does not do much in the mid game besides be a root and ult bot from range for his team.  I believe the biggest problem however, comes from his late game damage and move speed.  Hell yea its fun running around the map being **the fast** but that in my opinion, should just be moving fast.  Granting the ability to deal 600 damage in one auto and then run away to recharge rapid fire cannon and come back for an ass blasting is not enjoyable.  You cant go in cause he kits you back, you cant run away because his range from RFC and long range abilities keep you down.\r\n\r\nBelieve me, as a Jhin main I love this champion and I know a lot of the community does too and so does Riot.  But honestly it gets to the point where I&#039;m sick and tired of seeing him in every.single.game I am in.  So Riot, please just look into tweaking him down.","replies":[{"poster":"MOLTinaTOR","date":"2018-08-23T20:02:23.265+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":0,"body":"Jhin is fine.

Hail of Blades gives enormous AS, which is directly trnaslated into movement speed for Jhin. It also gives Stormrazor a very low CD. So Jhins' pattern basically becomes crit -> move around a bit -> crit again -> move around a bit -> crit again, which such an enormous amount of movement speed he's basically uncatchable.

Note how he didn't appear in the patch notes then all of a sudden become busted. I think it was a bunch of outside things that pushed jhin back to the top (not even gonna go down the stormrazor path cause obv its great on him) But games shifted where he wasn't getting outscaled and isn't getting bullied anymore in lane. (kaisa/lucian/ezreal days) Now the meta is in a really good spot for him cause games have extended a fair bit and he can get his items to become the flash while tanking everyone for 600 dmg. While I think its annoying to play against. His overall dps is the same/worse than other adc's. He's a bursty adc by design. I think as meta changes and riot changes stormrazor like they said they were more a/s less raw ad he'll fall back in line. Just my thoughts though I think the whole jhin is op is a knee jerk reaction to him being strong.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Norglics","date":"2018-08-24T04:19:44.666+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it is bs , the champ becomes uncatchable and can solo nearly everything even multiple enemies cause nothing can reach","replies":[]},{"poster":"HaIlMonitor","date":"2018-08-24T00:08:59.569+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I hope they Lucian him...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Akali Prime","date":"2018-08-23T17:34:15.616+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":5,"body":"u sell out, jhin main my ass","replies":[{"poster":"Rıots Bad Client","date":"2018-08-23T18:05:29.439+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Well, if they nerfed him.
