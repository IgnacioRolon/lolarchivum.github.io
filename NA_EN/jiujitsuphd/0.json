Pllaying on a Zenbook with 3200x1800 screen.. Cant see mouse og chat.. Not playable anymore. Adjusted screen resolution for lol, but no help :-( HAve to stop playing until I find a workaround.","replies":[]},{"poster":"jiujitsuPhD","date":"2018-01-04T21:21:04.764+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok, I tried about 50 different things before finding a solution. I also saw there are some 3rd party cursors (yolo) that do it too. I assume that would cause me to get banned so I did not try it. \n\nThe only thing that works is lowering the resolution of the game. However, I noticed that if I tab out at any time it makes the mouse small again...so apparently now I have another issue to figure out. Hopefully this helps someone else though. Just change the resolution in game not your actual PC resolution. \n\nTo the Devs - just fix this issue. Seems pretty easy to allow people to adjust the size of the mouse. Also allow them to make the other things even bigger, like the mini map and chat box. In 2018 this game should be running perfectly on a 4k monitor.","replies":[]}]}
