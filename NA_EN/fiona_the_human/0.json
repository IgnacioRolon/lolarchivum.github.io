It immediately says \"update failed\" and sometimes it loads behind that message. It always stops at 32% though. I have tried everything- restarting, re-downloading, even waiting over night. I've check several other message boards, and tried everything there. Nothing seems to work. My computer is on windows 10 and its relatively high speed. Please help asap, as I am board and have to much free time.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-18T04:34:39.825+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Failure during patching within the first 32% is typically caused by League not having the right administrative privileges. I strongly recommend working through our [permissions guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) to ensure everything's configured properly.\n\nLet me know if you were able to resolve this with those steps.","replies":[]}]}
