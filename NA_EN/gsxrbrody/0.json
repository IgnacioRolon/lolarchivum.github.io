I feel as though the reporting/ for abuse/toxicness can be abused it self... Ive been reported in games before for literally not doing much of anything wrong but because toxic people just want to harass you..... I don't bother reporting people because every game I have ever played has had people like that and its just been part of it... Wc3/wc2 diablo2 WoW every game literally.... I feel like my case should be reviewed...","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-23T01:39:26.476+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nah fam, \"retarded\" will almost always get you punished. Things like what you suggested aren't cool or beneficial to helping your team win, so they really don't have any place in League.","replies":[{"poster":"VirtualFlame","date":"2018-01-23T09:21:00.201+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-23T21:15:33.381+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It was something I was wanting to look into in case they had some kind of unique/special case.

Once you've had a 14 day ban, you're on very thin ice and abusing your teammates like that just won't fly. If you need official answer as to why you were punished or any other clarification, you can post your chat logs on the [Player Behavior boards](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation) and other players can weigh in.","replies":[{"poster":"GSXRBrody","date":"2018-01-23T02:26:07.983+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"majority of the time its me replying to them being toxic I don't report them though.....  I wish I could post a picture of a guy being toxic to me for no reason... And REPORTING ME... When I did nothing and when I reply to them is usually when I Get in trouble....

You misbehaved, and you were reported, hence why you got punished. If you chose not to report the other player, that's your right, but that does not excuse your behavior.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
