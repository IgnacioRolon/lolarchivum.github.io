For the rest of the game, my character and other characters stayed still on the map. After I lost my ranked game, my game stopped loading and wouldn't even finish with the \"defeat\" screen. My internet connection is stable too and no one in my game was experiencing this issue except for me.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RektByFaith","date":"2017-03-21T19:01:05.142+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yep.

Not as bad as sliding, but commands had a noticable delay more than usual.\n\nMy ping to google was 45-50 (I have a ping -t cmd prompt running constantly on my second monitor), and LoL ping was normal at around 75-ish.
