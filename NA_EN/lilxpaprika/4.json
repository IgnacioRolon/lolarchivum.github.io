It may be cost effective when you have more AD champs than AP, but that's also only true if they are AA focused champs. The biggest issue I have is that there's aren't many other support items that give CDR and tanky stats for champs like Leona. They are there, but they are lackluster. If zeke's could have a tweak, it would be the perfect item. Either a cost reduction, or an HP increase. Counter this by removing the AD bonus or something. Hell, I'd even take it with 10% cdr if the HP was higher.\n\n250 hp just doesn't justify rushing it over other items more useful or more tanky. The aura isn't very helpful if you're dead or if you're gimping yourself as a support by not getting something else.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"junglerboy16","date":"2015-04-20T00:13:20.822+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Erm, Tank meta doesn't need \"fixing\".\n\nZeke's is already a strong item (it is just a lot of invisible power that leaves it *incredibly* underrated) and the fact that tank meta gets countered by double AD comps which are in turn strengthened by Zeke's substantially already means it doesn't need buffs.
