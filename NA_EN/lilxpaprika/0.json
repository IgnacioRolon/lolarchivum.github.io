Such that it would always activate when your below 50% health.\nto compensate when above 50% health there's a shorter duration to keep it up without continuously hitting a target.. say 2.5 seconds\nyou shouldn't ever have to miss out on an opportunity to engage because you wanted to wait for rageblade's passive to come off cool down. it ruins the flow of the game.\nalso perhaps keep the %lifesteal up permanently if below 50%, having to always go looking to something to hit is bothersome.\nthis item could also use a better build path\nmaybe for a new build path create a new item composed of tome and long sword that gives slight ap buff with each stack. about 4ap each hit. or have it give extra as. would be good for jungling.\nedit :maybe initially give it 5% life steal (beloe50%hp) before its upgraded. \n\n right now its just sitting there.

Especially in this case since you want to be tanky enough that below 50% you wont get bursted (thank god for the removal of dfg). \nit could also be seen as a way to even out the effects of merellonomicon. so that you don't notice much of a difference. say your udyr you enter turtle form for sustain but have health reduction below 50% this kicks it stabilizing its effects.\n \nI think I might Nerf its ad and maybe shave a bit off the as. \n. the ap scaling should stay the same since its often the only way for bruisers to fit in some ap into their builds. \n\n\nnever mind just increase price don't Nerf it","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Rebonack","date":"2015-01-18T18:02:43.913+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hence, turn into into a hybrid penetration item =P\n\nThat's an item that a pretty wide selection of champions would actually be interested in.
