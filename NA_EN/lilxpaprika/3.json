Lets not let that get in the way of exploring cool possible modifiers for such boots if ever they were to exists. Let&#039;s instead discuss which suggestion we like dislike or improve upon. \n\nWith that being said, time to put those creative brain cells to work and come up with some cool passives.\n\nSo I&#039;ll start: boots give: 10% crit and converts a portion (say 10%-25%) of your crit damage to magic damage which you can&#039;t lifesteal off.. It would make it more tank oriented, such that its good on champions like irelia/volibear/xinzhao/aatrox/trynd/mastery Yi (all have built in heal) who might not require lifesteal so much.","replies":[{"poster":"Cloud273","date":"2015-04-17T00:07:21.935+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Let's not","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2015-04-17T02:52:03.231+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This... makes no sense at all.

Didn't mean tank so much as characters that can sustain. I absolutely agree crit boots would immensely benefit such champions. \n\nThat's the point of this thread to just get the conversation going... to find a passive that everyone can agree upon. I mean we could always just have plain old boots with say 12% crit and call it a day, I think it'd be more fun if they had something else going for them kind of like ninja tabis. \n\nOkay:here's another, 8% crit, if enemy below 50% health crits apply grievous wounds. \n\nOr how about 20% crit boots, except crits do -25% damage. Or something along those lines didn't do the math. \n\nOr give 10% crit +1 crit per surrounding enemy. Boots would cost 950 gold or it could be less cost efficient at 1000 gold. \n\nThe latter boots would offer fewer reliable stats than zerkers. I doubt it would affect {{champion:23}}  win rate. Its handy if you want to get zephyr instead of mercs.

Things added onto that would likely give them too much power. MPen boots only give MPen, Zerker's only give AS, Swift only gives extra MS... Only the tank boots, Tabi and Merc, give more than one stat, both being defensive though. Our Offensive ones give one stat since Mobility by itself can be considered an offensive stat. Keep it simple. Just some bonus crit chance.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Only Play Darius","date":"2015-04-17T02:59:52.559+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In other news: {{champion:23}} becomes god-tier.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LilxPaprika","date":"2015-04-17T00:41:02.286+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Aww you people are no fun. \ni guess if there were crit boots thered be no need to add a modifier","replies":[]}]}
