And there's room to tone it down if it so happens to be overly effective. \n\nThe thing is its the nature of Ap/ad items. Like triforce so good on so many champs. Same for botrk. \nThere's also a difference between suiting multiple champs and being must have on said champs. This can be just for the sake of variety by no means must have. \nJust asking for good as opposed to sub par.\n\nImo it should be good enough that if enemy team isn't stacking HP that its better to itemize rageblade on jax for example as opposed to botrk. If it can't do this at least then really what's the use, I mean jax of all people. \n\n And I think this version hits this sweet spot imo. It can also be nerfed but i wouldnt mind if for just a while seeing as how long it was a mediocre item on most champions and good on a few... that it had its moment of glory even for just one patch. \nWorst comes to worst i don't think it will be as bad as say cinderhulk on release. And they finally got it in a pretty sweet spot. The same could be made for rageblade. Just bringing the item some much needed attention could give us some insight on what could be the right solution for it. \n\ntwin shadows with new mastery changes will also be more viable soon.

This version does not give stacks from the active you still need to charge it by yourself. The active doesn't give it stacks it removes the cooldown on the lifesteal and spellvamp.

I think the lack of stats overall in rageblade, that is the fact that it has to wind up to get it's stacks is the reason why the item is not getting bought in almost any scenario. This is one of the reasons why I don't like the item or the actives you are giving it. Instead of just removing its passive and replacing it with something else and buffing its base stats, you are giving an active that gives tons of \"free stats.\" Just buff its base values instead and replace the surge passive.","replies":[{"poster":"LilxPaprika","date":"2015-06-01T13:11:31.274+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=CastawayTomHanks,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=wrEwrWEm,comment-id=000000000001,timestamp=2015-06-01T12:54:18.354+0000)\n you are giving an active that gives tons of \"free stats.\n\nnot sure what you mean by this. the active only removes the cooldown on lifesteal/spellvamp. \n\nRageblade gives a lot of stats though and it is more budget oriented too. can't overlook this. the stacking isn't all that difficult imo especially when spells add to it. \nExample on {{champion:5}} , you tend to open up with your three spells, that's three stacks off the bat. by your third auto attack the one that heals off W, you're at 6 stacks. \n\non certain champs you need the ap ratio after you fought a bit like on GP oranges, Shen shield, Trynd q, Warwick q etc. which also happens to be when your likely low on health. \nits also what keeps it niche ish. \nbotrk is botrk and triforce is triforce, unless you create another such item at its price point you can't directly compete with them. what you can do is make it a cost effective budget item. Rageblade isn't so much meant to replace them both, its nice along side either of them. example you could get {{item:3124}}  {{item:3153}} . would be strong since you can now lifesteal off of {{item:3153}}'s passive . This would be great if {{item:3078}}  is out of budget or if you are equipping {{item:3071}} . can get {{item:3800}} {{item:3110}}  for the mana.\n\nSay you need to equip resistances early on since you're likely front line.  the butter knife also helps with this. can get botrk butter knife and tankyness. complete rageblade later in the game.

Things like dangerous game healing from regen or a soraka or summoner heal will still be affected by healing reduction. A champions kits as well is affected like warwick q or xinzhao w. In that sense reduced healing is still very powerful in fact extremely power vs champions who are supposed to survive when low. They need some dependable sustain somewhere.\nEven other sustain items, spirit visage and sustain runes are affected by reduced healing. \n\nThis would stand out and be identified for its ability to counteract some of the power that reduced healing has. I'd say that's pretty intuitive and a trade mark of riot's game design/philosophy. As it really helps shape what the item is all about, clear definition of what it has to offer: dependable sustain when its needed most.
