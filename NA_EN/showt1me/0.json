However, as soon as one ability is thrown out (even if it's just me alone farming minions) especially during combat the game will rocket up to an average of 250-300ms, hitting record highs of 500+. \r\n\r\nIt's driving me insane and making me not want to play league anymore because I simply can't play.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-21T16:41:04.246+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you might be experiencing some packet loss so the game isn't able to communicate what's happening on screen properly.
