I already read the stickied post explaining that this board doesn&#039;t overturn punishments, but it will at least be worth a try. I pumped a lot of money onto this specific account and miss that I could play any champ (owned them all). It has the history of playing with my friends from back in Season 3-5, before they quit and I found a new group to play along with. I understand that I&#039;ll be denied, but I&#039;ve been really trying.\n\nThings I&#039;ve discovered about toxicity; 1) Voice is paramount to not being an ass to randoms, 2) Remembering that everyone on your team is a human (at least the VAST majority are, the fringe few are leveling bots, which you don&#039;t see in 30+), 3) Muting cross-team chat will reduce the likelihood that you&#039;ll gripe to enemy team about your team&#039;s failings, 4) Pros lose games, but they at least learn - so to must I.\n\ntl;dr Please unban my account, even though this board doesn&#039;t do that. A dude can hope.\nIf not, at least I&#039;ve learned;\n1) Voice comms help reduce toxicity\n2) Treating people like people reduces toxicity\n3) Disallowing cross-team chat reduces toxicity\n4) Pros lose too, so you&#039;re ok to lose sometimes.","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2018-11-19T09:27:37.889+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You will find out that Boards won't unban you no matter how much you beg in the same way that Riot eventually realized that you wouldn't get with the program and _just behave yourself_ no matter how much they encouraged good behavior and punished poor behavior.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Silly Neeko","date":"2018-11-18T12:20:37.461+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Once you are permabanned, nah.

As far as i know of, not even Tyler1 got his main account back, nor any of the other banned accounts. He was just allowed to play again without having the account banned on sight.\n\nView me however you want, view the words however harshly, however not only is the boards unable to do anything more than provide and pass information back and forth.... but the majority also know that if, SOMEHOW by some miracle that you got unbanned.... that they would have to do it with pretty much every single other persons accounts that claim to have reformed, and then there would be an absolute and total mess of trolls who want their accounts back so they can continue on trolling. Also there would be a nightmare of trying to figure out if this is the original account owner or someone else trying for the account that just got the password and username.\n\nYou will get the skins back eventually, you will get the champs back eventually, just think of this as similar to restarting a pokemon game to try out the different starter pokemon.","replies":[{"poster":"Ybuckethead","date":"2018-11-18T12:27:10.071+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, I know the fallout of what comes with unbanning one person (the rest want in).

When i first started, you got a like 100 IP per bot game, maybe 130 per normal. So to buy a 6300 champ you had to play like 63 games, which took a week or longer to do. Plus you had to buy runes (not the discounted tier 1 and 2 runes that were 1 ip, i mean they were like another 300 ip each for the tier 1 and 2)....\n\nNow you get about 10000 blue essence nearly for free if you didnt want any of the 5 or so free champions they give... the tutorial is SOOOOO much better than what it was before... though kiting and \"orbwalking\" seems to have missed making it to the tutorial. So you can easily get the champions you want, and you do level up to level 15 fairly quickly... so all runes unlocked within a few days to maybe a week.\n\nIt does feel a little grindy because you do not SEE the gain as much..... but honestly with you being able to upgrade the skin shards you can unlock champions much more cheaply than before. It just may not always be the one that you want.","replies":[{"poster":"Marøøn","date":"2018-11-18T12:58:05.957+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Barring the old rune system, Christ almighty that brought back a NAM-esque flashback.

The trick is to never get punished in any way and keep playing a moderate amount of games every week not leaving time when you didn't play any games. \nAlso whenever you get validly reported your Honor progress is slowed down.","replies":[{"poster":"Marøøn","date":"2018-11-18T20:47:06.730+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Out of curiosity, is it a valid report (me the recipient) if during the entire game and champ select I only say innocuous things, but in post-game lobby I say \"I only got 'x' honors for carrying :L\", is that reportable?

Me 1v9&#x27;ing is super rare, but the times I have, end with me getting 1 honor. xD\n\nFirst off,  you should be asking if it is punishable. People report for anything these days, I once got reported for  swapping skins pre-game because someone said I was showing off and we don't need that in the community.\nSo, is it punishable? I believe it is not, at least by its own. I cannot be 100% positive with riot rules because they are so fluid. But I have been following these boards for quite a while and I have never seen a case where the punished person did not specifically target words at a teammate. So saying \" God I carry this one handed mid but I get no honors\" might be a little bit on the dangerous side but even this would not get you punished by itself. \nAnd saying \"OMG most damage, least deaths, 6 towers taken, 2 correct baron calls weren't enough for a single honor\" I believe is 100% safe.\nIf you keep your words not targeted at a specific person it's hard to pin you down for \"harassment\" or \"verbal abuse\" because you can only harass/abuse people if you target THEM.\nAnd the best way to trash talk is to blame the game itself like\n\"Honor system bugged guys, I didn't receive your honors\"","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2018-11-18T13:50:32.892+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Getting honored has no correlation with how many keys you get.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2018-11-18T13:46:31.158+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Personally, I don't mind an appeal system, but I'd like to see those appealing go through a rigorous screening, reform behavior proof / auditing over lots of games (maybe a year's worth of games), and probably community service.","replies":[{"poster":"Marøøn","date":"2018-11-18T20:44:23.585+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You know, that last bit actually sounds like a really good idea for Riot's PR.
