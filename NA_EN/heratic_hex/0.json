In almost all games I experience heavy package loss making the game virtually unplayable. When it happens I still get updates about my HP/Mana Values, rough position of myself, minions and enemy champions. I don't get updates about attack animations, abilities, etc. Basically I don't see any effects. This lasts for 1 to 30 seconds or so, sometimes more (rare). After that all the effects I missed get thrown on screen at once (and I'm usually dead). It seems like this happens more frequently in Teamfights, but that may just be my perception. This happens several times a game, but not with the same severity in each game. Some games play just fine and as expected. \r\nRestarting my Router sometimes seems to fix the issue for one or two games, but it's not reliable and I can also get good games when I haven't restarted my router in days. It is also extremely unpredictable, as I can get one good game and then it goes bad and there is little I can do to know in advance before I go into a game. \r\n\r\nThe package loss also seems to affect my client, as sometimes I can't get into a team lobby, the queue or the pre-game. Also sometimes invites fail to reach me, or I only get the sound, but can't accept them. \r\n\r\nMy issues don't seem to be influenced by time of day at all or how many other people are in the LAN. My Ping is anywhere between 40 and 80 depending on time of day and activity on the Network, higher ping doesn't seem to correlate to a higher chances/severity of package loss.\r\n\r\n**Setup:**\r\nWireless LAN: An obvious weak spot for Online gaming, however getting a cable connection to the router is highly impractical. Considering that I only experience these game breaking issues in League I doubt it's the problem. There are five other people doing stuff on the Network, but as explained above, shouldn't be the issue as the network seems to be able to handle it quite well. \r\n\r\n**Things I tried:**\r\n- Reinstalling League: No change\r\n- Restart Router: No Change\r\n- Curse: No Change\r\n- Pray and Sacrifice to the Machine Spirit: No Change\r\n- Try physical connection with a laptop: No Change\r\n- Contact ISP: They were fruitless and unhelpful\r\n\r\nI really like this game, but it's currently pretty much unplayable for me. Which is not only very annoying, but also confusing as I don't experience such severe problems with other online games.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-24T00:24:50.031+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Let's first do a little test to check and see if packet loss is the main culprit of your lag issues before we start troubleshooting.
