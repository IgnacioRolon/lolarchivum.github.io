SERIOUS TOPIC","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":54,"down_votes":14,"body":"I mean for this to be a serious topic discussion about young new players with very negative attitudes becoming more frequent.\r\n\r\nI have been playing League of Legends consistently since November 2013, and by consistently I mean every day :D. I may be totally wrong in my observations of the past but the community seemed a lot different, a lot older and more mature. I was picturing my team mates as 20-40+ year old gamers who took the game somewhat seriously, at least to the point of trying to win and enjoying the camaraderie of a team PVP game. \r\n\r\nOver the last few months, I have noticed more and more &#039;trolls&#039;, bad language, and very unskilled players. When I talk to them in chat, I end up finding out they are 14, 12, or even 8 years old. And that&#039;s cool, but their attitudes are not most of the time, and skills often much worse. When I added the majority of my &#039;friends&#039; to my friends list, it was probably a year ago and then through the summer. All of them are between the ages of 26 and 38, I am 30. However, it seems as though over the past few months it has been a much younger and more immature group of players in queue. \r\n\r\nNew players are great, but why is there a report option for &#039;Unskilled&#039; if this isn&#039;t a possible issue worth addressing when it arises. I cant hardly explain the confusion and frustration I have honestly felt more and more while playing League of Legends. Watching a Jinx build all attack speed and no damage and never using abilities (all game), to a Udyr jungle that ended the game 0/3/1, his one assist I got him as he ran from my 1v3 battle, that I lost. AFK used to be the main problem to come up. Now it is immature players trolling around League. \r\n\r\nWhen I first started playing this game I thought it was really complicated and complex. Even once I got used to it and I realized I needed to truly know every champion and their abilities whether I own them or not so I know what to expect, the game took time to get reasonable at. At least in comparison to everyone I was playing with and for the most part against. Now I feel confident and although I don&#039;t play enough ranked for gold, I play all the time in my free time, my girlfriend would attest to that. I am getting to the point that I can truly hold my own, and soon will be able to carry multiple lanes. And to just be clear this is not my first PC game, I started playing PC in 1996. The difference is the games back then weren&#039;t nearly as complex as a game like League of Legends. And I can easily see where frustration and poor sportsmanship would come up in younger players. \r\n\r\nBut like I said, &#039;Unskilled&#039; is an option in the report menu and I don&#039;t know how much riot even cares about unskilled reports. But maybe that should be looked into. Not a ban, but maybe a 5 game AI restriction or something. I also don&#039;t know how seriously riot takes language and negative attitude reports, both tend to snowball and end games faster than URF mode, usually resulting in a loss. I understand as most people do that this is just a game, a free game at that, but it is a game I really enjoy playing, and I play it daily with friends.\r\n\r\nWhat do you gamers think? Has anyone else noticed this negative trend in the in-game community? Riot, any ideas on dealing with attitude issues (chat bans maybe) or for unskilled (restrictions on PVP). Obviously it would take more than one report to call for disciplinary action. But the reports are becoming more and more common, while the honorable opponents are becoming less and less.","replies":[{"poster":"GaleWinUnleashed","date":"2015-04-11T05:52:24.827+0000","up_votes":38,"down_votes":5,"body":"It's almost as though the COD players are hearing about League of Legends from their older siblings and trying it out.\n\nMore seriously, though, much of the toxicity in League seems to stem from the fact that many players have different ideas of what type of behavior is acceptable in an online community.

Yes, League still has strategy and whatnot, but when you have riot openly advertising the hastag #LCSBIGPLAYS, you know straight up that's not the strategy they're talking about. It's the shit like mid laner 1 On 1 duels with \"outplays\" and \"sick mechanics\" that don't effect the overall game that much.

It's obviously not that simple and there are flaws to what I'm saying, I'm only really bringing out extreme examples but the point itself still stands.\n\nA smaller example would be the lack of consideration for a team comp in champ select. Last picking Zed when your team is all AD because you want to make \"big plays\" when a heavy magic damage dealer like Viktor fits the comp better is also part of the problem of how Riot markets this game.\n\nDota has bad behaviour but in fairness to the Russians they actually attempt to win the game regardless of what is said to and by them [most of the time anyway]. In League it is incredibly common for someone to AFK when they start doing bad and/or get flak.\n\nI'm not saying my post is infallible or factually concrete with hard evidence so please do not treat it as that.

Yes, some will be so toxic you can't stand them, but in my experience that's a very small minority.\n\nHonestly, I find that I wonder if I've just been lucky because I have run into very few truly toxic players so far.

I have never been restricted or banned, I get honored after 2/3rds of my games by teammates and opponents, and I have garnered a reputation among at least a few of the other board users for my polite and thoughtful discussion. I am not amazingly skilled when I play, but I play with other equally unskilled players that my MMR should have me play with, so I don't ever get complaints about being a n00b or whatnot, because I am almost always right in the middle of the skill level in a given match (because eloboosting is for wimps who just want to brag about rank rather than play for personal enjoyment). I have actually been berated by my parents for being too polite to the other players in a match and not quitting for the sake of not ruining their experience.\n\nThat said, the first thing I would ask is that you not assume that the increase in negative behavior is entirely linked to the age of newer players. I don't doubt there is *some* correlation, but I have seen more than my fair share of obviously adult players who act with less dignity than my little brother (and he isn't even all that nice :P). \n\nSome of the toxicity stems from younger players who just don't respect that the people on the other side of the screen are humans, rather than \"really good bots\". They treat the game like it is PvE with a supporting cast of allied units, which is entirely inaccurate. On the other side of things though, I run into many players that obviously know that the people on the other side of the screen are human and take advantage of internet anonymity to be the worst kind of person they can be, at no cost to them except the chance of being reported every now and then. Those aren't all just 10 year old kids who spew profanities and treat other players like trash, because they are very obviously aware of the import of their words on the situation.\n\nBecause I don't have the time to play very often, I respect the fact that other players often have the same time restriction and can't play all the time, which forces me to assume most of the people who act so selfishly are the people who sit around with free time on their hands, usually meaning the guys who aren't in college, don't have a job, and live at home, or the little kids who are spoiled with little homework and a lot of free time to do whatever they want. \n\nI guess in conclusion I would argue that you cannot simply say because you as a representative of an older demographic are a nice player, that almost all players in your age group are nice, in the same way that I cannot say the same about my age group, or younger age groups entirely. League may be getting younger, but that is not the direct or only cause of the steady increase in player toxicity in the past year or so. If anything, I would say it is likely related to the fact that the Tribunal rework has been delayed so long, meaning that players only get banned by leaverbuster or massive amounts of reports. This has allowed the average \"toxicity acceptance\" level to increase amongst players (meaning fewer players bother to report toxicity and fewer players care about being toxic to other players), because they know their one report has little impact, and getting reported has little impact now that they don't review chat logs and other similar reports except when Riot support gets sent the most extreme cases. That is why to us players, it feels like toxicity is at an all time high, where according to Riot's numbers, toxicity is at an all time low.\n\nI hope this was helpful for the discussion.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ZGM Dazzling","date":"2015-04-11T15:50:17.347+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> I have noticed more and more 'trolls', bad language, and very unskilled players\n\nThere are 20 - 40 year olds like that too.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kapparoth","date":"2015-04-12T03:45:06.657+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I logged in just to say that I'm a teenager (confused about life, raging hormones, etc) and I don't act like this.
