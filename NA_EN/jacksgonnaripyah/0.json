Most local network settings can prevent a solid link from happening and cause blackscreens or complete disconnections. I recommend working through the steps outlined in our [Mac Connection guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues#section-mac) as a first step.\n\nLet me know if those steps helped.","replies":[]}]}
