I wasn't able to find a PBE account tied to this account. If you were instead granted access to the [Alpha Client](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/206201070-Alpha-Client-FAQ), then you will be logging in with your normal account credentials, but instead, be using the *new client* that will eventually replace the current one. \n\nThe PBE and Alpha Client are entirely **separate** systems, so if you have access to the **Alpha Client**, it doesn't mean you have access to the **PBE**.
