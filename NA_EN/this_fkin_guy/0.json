It was up until about the 20th is the first time it happened and in every game since then I'll have 2-5 seconds where I'm frozen, cannot move but everything around me is moving normal speed. I have checked out every log in my RAD since the 20th, most games have around 1.5 - 3% packet loss. Anyone experiencing this as well?","replies":[{"poster":"This Fkin Guy","date":"2016-07-24T04:52:27.271+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I left it on for about 15 minutes, nothing else is lagging.
