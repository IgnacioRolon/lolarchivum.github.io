The first time I was in a game and the issue resolved when I ended the process and reconnected. The second time, however, it was during the loading screen and I was not able to reconnect, resulting in my dodging the game.\r\n\r\nThis does not seem to happen every time--I had tabbed out of the first game several times before I could not tab back in. \r\n\r\nAny help or advice would be appreciated.
