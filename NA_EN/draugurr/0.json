Can't do that since it shows that i don't have enough IP. Then i tried to go to the window with the lore and move sets and do it that way. When i click on unlock it says \"Current IP 1604\" \"Cost 1350\" \"Balance 253\" so i clearly have enough. I click on Unlock again and this comes up \"Your purchase could not be completed at this time\" \r\n\r\nSo i decided to wait a few hours and tried again. Same thing comes up. I've tried to log in again and see if that helps. But still the same thing comes up Is there a fix for this already? If not Riot please fix this.","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-08-09T22:04:31.368+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Typically store errors are fixed by relogging so your client attempts to retrieve the correct account info from the server, but if the error persists you might want to try doing a client repair (click the question mark top right of the Launcher). If you continue to experience store errors I'd suggest submitting a [Support Ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-09T23:38:29.614+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sometimes your IP or RP balance doesn't sync with the server and incorrectly displays what you actually have. As DTN mentioned, a restart can sometimes fix it, sometimes even restarting your PC can do the trick as well. If you continue to have these issues, please let me know.","replies":[]}]}
