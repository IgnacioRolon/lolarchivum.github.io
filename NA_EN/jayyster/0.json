Post your chat logs.\n\nAs for the whole \"defending myself\" argument.  There's no such thing as \"defending yourself\", because there is no need to... if someone calls you a pejorative term, why would you even need to respond to it?  What is the point?  If they feel that way about you, do you think your words are going to defuse the situation, or will they make it worse?","replies":[]},{"poster":"CrazyCobra247","date":"2018-03-03T09:20:58.360+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry pal. Honestly you  a few choices at this point. After your punishment period, #1,play it real smooth (/muteall every game). #2 Make a new account to prevent your account with everything from getting perma banned and lost forever. #3 Keep playing screw up and get perma banned and eventually quit most likely. #4 Reform (Very unlikely because the System is to blame)\n\nIn case you didnt relize Im against Perma Banning for \"toxicity\". I do support it for Hacking. I think they should treat Toxicity with Perma Chat Restrictions but apparently they have tried this at some point, even though Ive played this game since it came out and dont recall them ever doing that.

Its utterly disgusting that the other player doesnt even get considered for punishment. They are literally saying \"its ok to call people vulgar names for no reason, but its not ok to defend yourself from it\"","replies":[{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2018-03-03T11:13:43.052+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Jayyster,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=GAyg0emy,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2018-03-03T09:23:17.542+0000)\n>\n> Its utterly disgusting that the other player doesnt even get considered for punishment.\n\nWhat makes you think that the other person was not punished?","replies":[{"poster":"Jayyster","date":"2018-03-03T22:23:01.118+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Zezockary,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=GAyg0emy,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2018-03-03T11:13:43.052+0000)\n>\n> What makes you think that the other person was not punished?\n\nWhen you report someone and they get a penalty issued to them, you get an in game message saying that a player you recently reported was punished.
