Please Help","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yesterday windows decided to update my computer and a new patch downloaded. Since then my computer has been fully crashing whenever I get into a game. The screen freezes up and the sound just makes a low buzzing noise. I can't do anything but hold the power button until my computer shuts off, but when I power back on and log back in, I can get into the game without a problem, I'm just 4 levels behind.\r\n\r\nI'm wondering if anyone has encountered this problem before or if anyone is currently experiencing it and has any solutions to it. It's really frustrating because I don't know anything about computers, I just like to play on them.\r\n\r\nThanks for the help!!!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-23T20:31:53.850+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, a recent Windows 10 update has been causing a freezing issue for some players.  The problem appears to be with the [Xbox Game Bar](http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8637-game-bar-turn-off-windows-10-a.html) game bar not interacting well with the game.  Disabling it should fix this up!","replies":[{"poster":"Over Innsmouth","date":"2016-09-24T11:48:52.776+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi, I was wondering if you could help me out with a similar issue. Every time I go into games about a minute in my game freezes, I get a \"League of Legends Client has stopped working\" error message and it boots me from the game. I'm then taken back to the in-client Reconnect screen, but reconnecting simply has the issue occur again and again roughly every minute. I've repaired my client twice and have tried starting League as an admin, and nothing seems to work.\n\nCould you please help me out?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-24T15:15:38.422+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your issue is strange because it sounds like you're able to make a connection to the game server, but some outside source is causing issues with it.  Are you using any third party programs that interact with League?  Apps like play.tv, overlay, and recorder have been known to cause issues like this.  If this is the case for you, remove them for the fix!","replies":[{"poster":"Over Innsmouth","date":"2016-09-24T21:15:48.332+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Seems to be working, after uninstalling Play.tv and reinstalling my client.
