When I logged on to try to see if this was true, I got the account banned message. From the E-Mail I got, it seems he was using cheats on my account.\n\nAs of now, I am banned until Jan 1st, so luckly not perma banned. rip me.\n\n@riot don't know if you will unban me, but i've changed my passwords for email and league incase you do. My email was hacked around the 11th, he's played since then.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-27T21:46:03.737+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I went ahead and looked into your account history and it does look like it was most liked compromised, but I'm not 100% sure if that was why the ban was placed or not.
