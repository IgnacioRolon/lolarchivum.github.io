I wasn't playing last year due to my PC breaking and didn't get the chance to by them. So will they be re-released this year? And is so, when? I know it's supposed to be during patch 7.21{{champion:117}}","replies":[{"poster":"BIIIIIIIID","date":"2017-10-18T11:01:31.691+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would like to know also. I was promised by someone from Riot back in Spring that they would be re-released this season. I was on deployment in Afghanistan during the event last year and missed out on Little Devil Teemo. I main him and have really wanted this skin and have waited forever. If its not released I'm legit contemplating quitting the game. Its ridiculous that Riot withholds things from being purchased in the first place, but then to not at least make them eligible for purchase once a year is just insulting.
