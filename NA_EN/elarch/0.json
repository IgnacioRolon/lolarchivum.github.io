Gambit game really cements it. The EU and NA LCS groups should play best of 2 or best of 3 series during the regular season. UoL look so different than the hit or miss team that they were during the regular season when they had the chance to play a few games at a time. I personally don&#039;t think that the best of one format gives us a good feel for how good or bad teams are in the NA/EU regions. \n\nEdit:\nThey should also split up the games to not be on 2 days a week but should have games spread across the whole week. That would allow a 2+ game format to work and help those of us who need our LCS fix get it all week long.","replies":[{"poster":"Smart Kitty","date":"2015-04-05T21:50:38.282+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think it's fine now, but if they implemented bo2 or bo3 they'd need to spread it out throughout the weeks.

Even a Series of 2 (LPL) are more beneficial than a single game.\n\nTime is the factor. Riot has this deadset mentality that fans have to watch EU **AND** NA and LPL and LCK. So they scheduled them (at least EU/NA) around each other. Which really just crushes the ability for those two regions to play more.\n\nThink about this. 4 days for NA/EU LCS Starting Thursday and going to Sunday. Same days as EU/NA LCS are doing now. Teams still have two matches to play against teams, but the matches are best of 3. Now here is the twist, both EU LCS and NA LCS go on at the same time!!! 4 days for EU and 4 days for NA (times of course would vary). \n\nThe most obvious issue with this is teams losing out on practice time, but if the teams matches were only on two days. The teams would still have 5 days of practice, it may require that teams get more scrim partners (as if they constantly scrim the same teams, those teams may not be available in this format).\n\nI think it would over all improve skill/experience for NA/EU. Current NA/EU Format Sucks.
