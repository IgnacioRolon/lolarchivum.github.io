This most often happens if there are problematic local network settings that are blocking League. I recommend working through our [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to address the most common solutions for this issue.\n\nLet me know if this resolved your issues or not.","replies":[]}]}
