Hopefully, theres a fix soon. It makes it to where I can hardly play. Thanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-03T15:47:47.926+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Gotcha.

It's one of those situations where it's difficult to exactly pin-point what is wrong (as so much is muscle memory at this point), but after a bit of testing I think I have a better idea of what is making the mouse feel 'off.'\n\nThere seems to be a slight delay in either curser movement or click response during times of rapid mouse motion. So, for example, if you're quickly moving the curser around the screen during a team fight to select various targets, the curser will have a super subtle delay on the screen and then jump to where it should be. It took a while for me to realize this due to how slight it is, but I believe this to be why everything feels a bit off.\n\nI would be simply pulling stuff out of my butt in suggesting what is causing this, but probably something to do with how Sierra manages CPU intense programs/apps ( for reference, here â€“ http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/254143/macos-sierra-reducing-cpu-usage-of-processor-intensive-processes ).\n\nSo it's a bit of a bummer this is happening, but in the meantime I've just worked to adjust my mouse settings to off-set the problem a tad.","replies":[{"poster":"MadChad1","date":"2016-09-24T13:50:25.315+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've tried the same thing.
