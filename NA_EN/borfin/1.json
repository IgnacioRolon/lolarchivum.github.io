If you have an AD bruiser and you're doing well, you don't really need blue buff all that much.\n\nIt's the ones that go oom quickly or are AP (Fiddlesticks and Ekko would definitely need at least the second blue buff).\n\nIt's also part of a risk assessment. Certain mages *need* to build cdr and mana regen first then AP, not have a pure AP build. Blue buff should never be a guarantee, considering that the blue buff can be invaded and stolen, or even taken from the mage in question if they die. As a jungle main, I will not give an early blue buff to a mage who cannot prove themselves responsible enough (like going oom too early when they aren't even being camped or harassed too much, don't respond appropriately to ganks, feed, don't ward, etc). But like you, I do \"reward\" them if they've proven themselves to be competent and I don't really rely on the thing.\n\nBut people with the \"blue buff belongs to the midlaner!\" mentality are kind of iffy with me. Some might be really good midlaners who are gods if they have the thing, and some just feel entitled and don't know how to manage their resource (I don't even MAIN mid and I can last-hit autos and manage my mana just fine whenever I go there, so I know that saying all midlaners need blue is a load of bull.).","replies":[{"poster":"Need Gold 4 Tent","date":"2015-06-10T16:44:38.964+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, it is arguable that the mana hungry mages could RUSH their AP while getting blue buff to snowball their lane but errr...
