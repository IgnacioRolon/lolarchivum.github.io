But Bjergsen is as well for TSM, and yet Bjergsen is undeniably the single best player in North America.\n\nK.\n\nThe age of Cloud 9 will never be here again with Hai. Unless he suddenly starts practicing and gets better.\n\nAnd it's sad cause they were fun to watch in their prime.","replies":[{"poster":"TCU Dushi","date":"2015-03-09T18:56:09.173+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hai isn't bad. \n\nBut as mentioned by others his champion pool is not up to date/big enough.\n\nIt seems he lacks confidence. I don't know wether that's him knowing his champion pool is lackluster or he is in some sort of a slump.\n\nI haven't seen Hai dominate the mid lane this split and it seems like C9 struggles a bit because of it. His performance on Kennen last weekend was really good though.\n\nDuring season 3 i was amazed by how refreshing c9 played and how well coordinated they seemed compared to the other teams. Right now it seems as if they are playing forced champions/setups that don't fit their playstyle.\n\nThe real problem seems to be balls, He can't play AP mages top (at the same level as some of his other champions) and the rumble pick is getting old. Old as in, everyone knows it and he's not playing as flawlessly as before.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Linthe","date":"2015-03-09T18:29:55.654+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I take it you missed his Kennen play this past weekend. \n\nBan Zed ploy foiled.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wullf","date":"2015-03-09T14:19:16.313+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Best NA player is actually European.","replies":[{"poster":"Vixanys","date":"2015-03-09T17:27:16.578+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"XWX is European?","replies":[{"poster":"Wullf","date":"2015-03-09T18:48:43.946+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I dont actually know who is the best player I am just following OPs idea of Bjergsen being the best.","replies":[{"poster":"Vixanys","date":"2015-03-09T19:07:08.540+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh, point made.

No other team that I know of has a player that literally gets blamed for EVERYTHING. But if C9 loses, it is instantly hai's fault, no matter what. For most of this split, other people on C9 have messed up every bit as much as hai. And blaming all C9's problems on Hai is ludicrous. And also, if you cast you mind back a couple splits ago, Hai would often flat out 1v1 bjergsen in lane, with even cs and kills, and in addition, hai is often behind because he plays more of a supportive style then midlaners like bjerg who just makes his whole team camp him so he gets fed and everyone freaks out because of how good he is.  Hai is not a great mid, but saying he is the worst mid in the west in just silly. And bjerg is seriously over-rated by many people. He isn't faker, no matter what you may think.","replies":[{"poster":"Michael C137","date":"2015-03-09T13:18:27.284+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"They have actually been moving away from the feed Bjergsen style.

So I kinda just snapped at the idea bjerg is miles ahead of hai. And while hai is struggling, I don't think he is any more than all of C9 right now. And as for his champion pool, C9 has for most of their career had the philosophy of picking the strongest champions in each role, and I think hai will pick zed almost whenever it is up, not because it is the only champ he can play, but because it seems, in hai's mind at least, to be the best mid laner on this patch. He will most likely pick zed most times its not baned, but when it is, he can still play other stuff like liss, kennen,  or maybe ahri cause I heard a rumor than he has been practicing her hard in solo-queue.","replies":[{"poster":"Michael C137","date":"2015-03-09T14:13:01.802+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think that picking Zed any time its available is a pretty solid strategy for a mid laner! Even in their loss to TiP his Zed play made Impulse seriously question their lead and stalled that game out as long as possible. He gave c9 the only chance to comeback and win that game. I personally like to see cloud 9 and TSM continuing to get stronger, and CLG is welcome on the hype train too, because I want NA teams to finally prove something on the world stage. I think that this could be the year!","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Aozora","date":"2015-03-08T16:30:47.346+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even though Hai used to be considered a/the carry of C9 along with Meteos for like the last 2 seasons?\nHai is actually one of the top mid laners in the west and I'd rank him around the top 3 or 4 in NA, his problem is the fact that his champion pool atm is small. His main champions used to Zed (untouched), Syndra (nerfed), Fizz (nerfed), Kassadin (nerfed), and Kha'zix (nerfed). He's not bad, not by a long shot cause C9 left TIP baffled on how to actually close out the game. \n\nEarly into the season it's fine to stick to your comfort picks but at this point, you need to expand your champion pool and experiment. He pulled out Lissandra once and did well. He spammed Ahri in solo q for a week, but has yet to play her. Now he's been playing more Viktor. \n\nYou morons that actually believe that Hai is bad/always has been bad are the same idiots that believe everything they see in the Twitch chat circle jerks.

It is rather small by comparison in the world of Mids, but his shot-calling is amazing. Which instantly makes him a competitive force. His performance does not impact his shot-calling either.\n\nI believe that if he could expand that champion pool that he could be better than Bjergsen without a doubt.\n\nHai's play isn't his mechanics. It isn't in-game decision making. It is simply a lack of a broad champion pool.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Immortal Strife","date":"2015-03-08T14:33:54.738+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hai needs to expand his champion pool beyond Zed and Syndra inorder for C9 to get back to their dominate ways.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Yinsenpai","date":"2015-03-08T15:04:37.268+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I wasnt the only 1 thinking this so happy i dont see how c9 thinksgoing zed every game if they dont ban it is ok its unacceptable and its just stupid he can easily be counterpicked because they already know hes only playing zed","replies":[]}]}
