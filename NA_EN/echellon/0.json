Basically, that means at least *half* of your connection got corrupted as soon as it hit your ISP. I'd strongly suggest reaching out to them with this proof to show them that there is a problem somewhere.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Hans Mit Flammen","date":"2017-10-30T09:16:43.558+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Broporo,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=gKI0e4ZE,comment-id=000300000000,timestamp=2017-10-30T00:35:20.117+0000)\n>\n> No worries, this still helps to narrow down what the main problem is for us all. \n> \n> You mentioned hearing from those around you that they&#x27;re having issues getting connected with the same ISP as well?

My characters don't teleport anymore and I don't get any of the 3,000-5,000 crazy numbers that I used to.  Maybe that's a coincidence since it doesn't seem logical that resolution would affect ping, but *shrug*.  It seemed to somehow help me. Maybe it'll luck out for you too? GLHF \n\nEDIT:  My FPS stayed the same between Fullscreen and Borderless Window at a constant 90-100+ on a laptop.  Yes, I know the difference between FPS and ping, thank you kindly.  :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ashtwee","date":"2017-10-29T02:35:40.577+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have this problem, too. My ping is normally around 30-40 but after the patch, it's jumped up to 500-600 and hangs around 100-300 more often.
