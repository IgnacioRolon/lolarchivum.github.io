I've contacted Riot three times about this and only in the latest response I got a legitimate answer for my troubles. My internet is insufficient to play the game. Now I believe this to be complete bs because nothing about my internet or computer has changed since I started playing mid season two. Has anyone else experienced this problem and better yet, found a way to fix it. I left this game for seven months because of it and only recently came back to see if it would fix itself before contacting Riot again to get the previous response.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-25T19:01:08.395+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Taking a look into the ticket, I'm not certain what happened but I want to help you out.
