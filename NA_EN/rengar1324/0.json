Some examples being, via breathing exercises, Meditation, finding a professional to help you. I am going to be honest. If you really don't have the self-control to be able to control what buttons you press on a keyboard. You might need to talk to a professional about the situation. Because if you can't control yourself with something as simple as pressing keys on a keyboard. I start to wonder what else you can't control to well.","replies":[{"poster":"breakordoom444","date":"2018-08-05T19:10:54.098+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean.... he can just unbind the key settings......","replies":[{"poster":"Trundamere","date":"2018-08-05T22:00:22.555+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Inless i'm blind.
