But some things I&#039;ve been noticing is that she has some glaring flaws and is very hazy in her identity. Riot is all about how identity is important for a champion, but when most of the community can&#039;t decide if she is a horrible adc, a undesirable top lane bully, or a anti-assassin mid laner I think that&#039;s a problem that needs to be addressed. I feel like Riot has just forgotten about her, even though I know they haven&#039;t because they give her skins here and there. I feel like they are just ignoring her because no one plays her often. \r\n\r\nI don&#039;t care if Quinn never becomes top tier, but when your flamed every game for playing a champion in any role, I think there needs to be a clarification of the champions identity and some attention, no matter how minor, to their kit. Most of the changes to Quinn have been bug fixes, and don&#039;t address her identity problems.\r\n\r\nQuinn doesn&#039;t fit as an ADC because she has shorter range then vayne, an unreliable steroid, and an ult that puts her into melee range\r\n\r\nQuinn doesn&#039;t fit as an assassin because she has no real way of escaping a fight after getting a kill if she does get one. Her ult speed falls off if hit even once so she cant stick well enough to use her atk speed, and since her engage tool and escape tool is her E and R, once those are used its impossible to get out unless they ignore you. \r\n\r\nTop lane you deprive your team of a tank, and you don&#039;t offer as much carry potential as other squishy top laners like Fiora, and mid lane you suffer the assassin identity problems. \r\n\r\nI just feel that riot should clarify her identity, and tune her kit accordingly. I really want to know if Riot is even thinking about Quinn, and I will consider this thread a success if I can get a small confirmation that some fixes to Quinn are even being considered.","replies":[{"poster":"RiotRepertoir","date":"2015-09-04T09:01:53.056+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":2,"body":"We haven't forgotten about Quinn.

It also makes me glad to see Repertoire potentially testing some changes! \n\nFrom my experience she really isn't that bad of an ADC as long as you have a good hard engage support like Leona to bully with and she's very snowbally. However, she can fall behind really easily and kinda becomes useless lategame if you don't have the right comp. She's probably best at splitpushing and getting 1v1 picks, which I think is appropriate for her character and identity as a scout/ranger. I also think her ult is very useful in many situations and isn't that bad overall, but it would be nice if Valor could have some kind of defensive buff or something so that you don't get 1 shot as soon as you go into melee range to fight someone. Perhaps tweaking her passive a bit to be more reliable wouldn't be a bad idea, either, especially the really annoying interaction of having someone get marked halfway through an aa... Making her aa animation a bit smoother, too, wouldn't hurt either, since it's so easy to accidentally cancel.\n\nOverall, everything that's already been said basically addresses my concerns. She's not really in that bad of a spot, she just requires a different playstyle than most other adcs and fills a very unique niche role that takes some getting used to on top of some annoying bugs/interactions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"NoMonku","date":"2015-09-03T08:16:29.738+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"She has an \"identity\" it just isn't that clear.

Apart from making autoattacks miss, it could also make targeted spells (but not skillshots) miss too.\n2. The skill as Valor would be a skillshot based dash (About as far as Quinn's autoattack range) that is still collision based and does aoe damage and blind upon attacking.\nThis definitely gives them more survivability against mages/caster type champions without changing any base stats, as well as Valor having a secondary escape mechanism. Being a skillshot, it should be a more rewarding skill.\n\nFor Valor, I'm completely on board with removing Skystrike in exchange for perma-bird form and the lower cooldown, as long as - \n1. Skystrike's execute capabilities are still part of Valor's reportoire, so something like skills/autoattacks dealing increased damage to the target based on their missing health would work.\n2. Valor also gets a passive, something that involves Quinn (To emphasise their identity as a duo).\n3. Quinn and Valor's skills no longer have shared cooldown.\n\nAnother concern of mine is definitely the reliability of her passive. I mentioned in another thread that I had a few ideas and I'll post them here too -\n1.) Quinn's first basic attack against any unit always deals Harrier damage, and the passive cannot be triggered on the same target for the next 3 seconds unless Quinn Vaults onto them.\n2.) Valor acts like Lulu's Pix and deals additional damage to a target after an auto attack by Quinn or the use of her skills. As Valor the passive would change to every 3rd attack Valor attacks twice at reduced damage each hit (Which scales up each time Quinn's ult is levelled up), like Master Yi's double strike.\nOR\n3.) Remove her current passive altogether and replace it with critical strikes dealing additional damage (Which scales as Quinn levels up), with BOTH Blinding Assault and Vault being able to critically strike. This additional damage can stack with {{item:3031}} and runes.","replies":[{"poster":"Demonwolf","date":"2015-09-05T19:55:47.528+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"What if her Q literally blinded players to have no vision on anything at all and only saw their own model in a sea of darkness?\nAfterall, Valor did gouge their eyes out.","replies":[{"poster":"Valor Bot","date":"2015-09-06T05:07:20.313+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've thought about this idea too and would really like it.

But yeah my major source of frustration is it seems Riot is ignoring her and there is no indication that they care about Quinn when she has a low play rate and is disliked by the majority of the community for no other reason then the pre-conceived notion that \"she sucks...she's an adc with a melee ranged ult\". \n\nIf anything, the things I want changed/answered by Riot are.\n\n1.

However I am concerned about her identity as represented in her kit compared to what she was intended to be. One minute she's a marksman with utility and burst, the next she switches to a melee carry/kamikaze bomber, that play style is extremely unhealthy for someone like Quinn who doesn't have much survivability in the first place, and late game Skystrike does less damage than a Harrier auto (which can crit for even more damage and is somewhat safer than Skystrike). Not to mention you lose the movement speed bonus and ignoring unit collision so you can't even escape once you're done. What Quinn needs is more survivability for Valor through his skill-set, whether it be a new passive or cooldown refreshes/reductions for E and/or Q (or both), as well as removing shared cooldowns for their skills. Removing Skystrike wouldn't be so bad either if they move the execution component towards Valor's skills or autoattacks and reduce the ult's cooldown. I think any of those would strengthen Quinn and Valor's ability to roam, make picks during skirmishes and team fights, as well as increase their survivability in melee range.\n\nI like the idea of being untargetable during Vault, but only the dash component and not Quinn's flip, as there still needs to be some counterplay around that skill.\n\nI also definitely agree with the need to fix her autoattack animation, I've had problems getting kills because Quinn doesn't do her autoattack properly. I also noticed a bug (I think), where if Quinn dies and she fired a Harrier autoattack at her target before dying it will not do any damage. I also think her Woad Scout skin needs more clarity, so we can tell the difference between her normal autoattack, a Harrier autoattack and a W passive autoattack. At the moment they all have a blue glow so I can't tell the difference, as opposed to a single bolt for her normal skin's autoattack, two bolts for a Harrier autoattack, and a yellow glow on her bolts for each W passive autoattack.","replies":[{"poster":"Valor Bot","date":"2015-09-06T05:14:19.106+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with the idea of giving her some more resistances during Tag Team.

Or unique. Or even engaging for that matter. I want to feel engaged when I ult, like olaf's or zed's, or even karthus's ult does. You feel engaged when you ult someone. with quinn it's more of a  \"well I already know what I'm wanting to do, this just helps me do it, and now it's over? ok...\"\n\nI really have no idea what the BEST way to rework her is, or if her ult needs a rework, all I know is her kit seems disjointed, clunky, and overall, it kinda well.. just sucks. The worst part is it took riot WAY too long to fix all the bug's and spaghetti code wrong with her kit, and there's still stuff buggy with it. same as azir, syndra, etc. I'm more annoyed that it took them so long to fix stuff that shouldn't make it past beta-testing than the fact that she well....sucks. way to go with that quallity assurance, Riot.","replies":[]},{"poster":"WarlockLaw","date":"2015-09-04T18:01:12.867+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SentineIs,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=oleyctou,comment-id=,timestamp=2015-09-03T07:48:58.578+0000)\n>\n> Top lane you deprive your team of a tank, and you don&#039;t offer as much carry potential as other squishy top laners like Fiora, and mid lane you suffer the assassin identity problems. \n\nMy build with Quinn top actually leaves her tankier than Fiora/Riven etc. With Quinn you really only need Youmuu's,  Botrk and cleaver to kill ppl as you don't need to go class cannon squishy dps as the real adc should be doing that. Also with those 3 items you have more than enough burst to kill the enemy adc consistently which is my goal mid/late game as Quinn. After those items I usually go full tank with items like Randuin/banshee/spirit visage. \n\nI just hope that when they do change her it is something more along the lines of Garen or Darius where they only buff her existing patterns and make them stronger while also adding in more glaring weaknesses (though not necessarily the stupidly high numbers).
