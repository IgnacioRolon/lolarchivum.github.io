I put my username and pass and then it authenticates and then says \"loading\" and never loads. There are two thing i realised. One, there are no settings. I mean the button is there, but when i click it, there's only a \"/\" on the top right of the window and a \"done\" button below, the whole window is empty otherwise. Second, the wallpaper animation freezes when it starts to say loading. \r\n\r\nAlso, i just found out that i appear online to my friends when it starts to say loading. They message me, and i get the notificiation but i cant see anything of those.\r\n\r\nSo please, can anyone help me (also i was tried putting a photo, but i dont know how cuz this is my first post ever)\r\n\r\nThanks in advane! ^_^","replies":[{"poster":"Dark Morgana","date":"2017-08-08T18:39:09.083+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That definitely sounds like a connection issue if i've ever heard one! If the client isn't able to connect to the server it won't be able to authenticate the login. Let's start with the steps in this [Connection Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664) and if it continues from there you can reach back out to me. \n\n{{champion:25}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"SeekerK","date":"2017-08-08T06:39:21.614+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello\n\nHow long has this issue been happening to you?\n\nThis issue often fixes itself but to be safe, could you please share me your LeagueClient logs the moment you get this error:\n\n* Go to \"C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Logs\\LeagueClient Logs\\\"\n* Select the latest \"LeagueClient.log\" file\n* Open it using notepad or a similar program\n* Select everything (ctrl + A) and copy it\n* Go to [pastebin.com](https://pastebin.com/) and paste the content there\n* Set the expiration date to 1 week\n* Submit it\n* Share the link with us\n\n---\n\nEu Boards player helper","replies":[]}]}
