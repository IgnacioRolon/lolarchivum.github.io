Seeing that mid was never my strong suite, i most likely tilted hard in that game and couldn't cs because they were pushing hard and we were despearatly trying to defend ourselves, BUT this isn't just about that game, i'm speaking collectively here, against and with them on my team, i can say i've seen it enough times to know how much annie ult influences team fights. \n\nanyways zed or diana's ult doesn't take half my health instantly, i've actually have time to react to it with a zyhonas or qqs before deathmark procs and its not certainly not a aoe stun, she clearly has a gimped (unbalancable in its current state) kit, don't take my word for it, take the word of the people in a much higher elo who've said plenty of times before. \n\nbesides zed and dianas are assassin, they are allowed to have high damage considering when most of their damage are heavily reliant on single target damage as well as coming into melee range where i can actually fight back, my team shouldn't have to spend 3k each just to counter 1 champion.","replies":[{"poster":"Saianna","date":"2015-10-20T04:35:01.434+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Are you dumb or what?\n\nSubject 5 just analyzed your game against Annie.\nYou (and your team) made at least 5 major goofs.\n\nDon't you dare even thinking of QQing in forum and asking for nerfs just cause of your errors.","replies":[{"poster":"Rustling Bush","date":"2015-10-20T04:56:22.836+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"i don't know, seems like alot of people agree with what i'm saying in regards to her ult being to strong, and i wanted to clarify that i wasn't saying nerf annie based on one poorly done game. \n\nhow would you go about team fighting when annie is around? you can say buy a banshee but then you would lose out on a ton of potential damage, even more so if you end up having to make it your third item, its 3k and it can be popped by 4 other people, i am trying to think logically about it.","replies":[{"poster":"Saianna","date":"2015-10-20T05:49:46.156+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"...........\n\nDon't gimme that sour argument \"seems like alot of people agree with what i'm saying in regards to her ult being to strong\"\n\nFrom what i see lots of people agree on you failing hard against annie.\n\nAnnie is fine as long as you won't:\na) feed her (you failed here)\nb) give her easy cs (you failed here)\nc) don't cluster with whole team in 1 spot when teamfight begins (you failed here)\nd) use common annie counterpicks (you failed here)\ne) change lane with someone who knows what Annie does (you failed here)\nf) abuse weak spot Annie has (you failed here)\ng) you didn't built MR at all, nor noone in your team (you failed here)\nh) you picked terrible places to teamfight.
