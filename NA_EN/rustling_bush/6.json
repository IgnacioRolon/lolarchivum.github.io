ADC's usually go in the duo lane because they typically are easy to kill, but they can afford to share XP due to being more gold dependent for late game damage.  Assassins and mages usually go mid because the shorter distance between the turrets means they can escape better if they need to run.  Fighters and tanks tend to go solo top because they can't afford to share the experience most of the time, but are generally better at staying alive than assassins and mages.  Junglers are usually tanks, fighters or assassins because those three roles are usually the best for ganking and clearing jungle camps.\n\nKeeping this all in mind, it's easy to understand many of the 'off-meta' picks that work well:\nKassadin is seen almost exclusively top lane because he's beefier than most other assassins.\nVarus is played mid often because he has no escape other than just running or using flash.\nNasus get's played on a serious level in top lane or jungle, because he needs to stack his Q, and trying to farm in mid or bot lane is a very risky proposition early game.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Capt Winters","date":"2015-11-02T13:33:20.063+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Why are you telling me that, you want me to pity you for not being able to play what you want because \"meanies are calling roles and i need to be the saint here\"?\nAnd my stupid comment was calling out your retarded double standards.

After playing so much ranked, I really didn't want to play seriously in normals anymore unless I wanted to learn something. (This doesn't mean that I play normals solo and just play troll champs and trolly builds, I only do that when I'm queuing up with friends). Overall though, I will agree that normals should be taken seriously in the sense that you decided to play the game and want to win it and as such you should be helping your team. In ranked, however, you should be giving both your normal effort plus an additional effort considering it counts onto your ranked record.","replies":[]}]}
