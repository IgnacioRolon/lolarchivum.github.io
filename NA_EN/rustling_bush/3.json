IT DOES NOT WORK IN 1 ON 1 SKIRMISHES NOR DOES IT WORK IN TEAMFIGHTS! YOU CANT JUST GO TO THE DAMN JUNGLE IN THE MIDDLE OF A TEAM FIGHT AND REGENERATE MANA ON A CAMP AND THEN RETURN BACK TO THE TEAM FIGHT!\n\nfuck this pisses me off so much. runeglaive does NOTHING to make up for its nerf and the fact that riot nerfed her W PURELY because of runeglaives mana restoration blows my fucking mind to the next galaxy.\n\nthe W nerf completely destroys my playstyle with eve because i go max CDR on her. with a 0.9 sec CD on her Q from max CDR i go oom INSANELY fast, but im also allowed to spam my W and even able to have it up 100% most of the time in fights, especially if resets are taken into consideratinon. with 40 mana added to W i can no longer do that... even if i get frozen heart its still fucking terrible. \n\n\nit hurts even worse on AD evelynn tho, which is my preferred way to build eve. i can try to get around it with {{item:3508}} , but id have to give something up like {{item:3072}} for it... which is horrible.

I also said nothing about the W cost being viable because of Runeglaive, you seem to have a hard time reading things but that's not my problem either.\n\nI sustain my mana just fine both in the jungle and when fighting. I don't really care if it makes you angry, I've never had mana problems outside of the early game. Granted I don't go full CDR because I know what it will do to my mana pool if I do. It's not rocket science but since you had a hard time understanding what I typed I see why this simple concept frustrates you. But throwing a temper tantrum at someone who has no control over how Riot buffs or nerfs champions is just a waste of both of our time.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"crazydanddgnat","date":"2015-10-28T07:06:02.631+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think one of the core problems is that many of the people that have played her for a while are familiar with and like her as the ultimate early ganker, and this nerf just absolutely destroyed her early clears, which were painful to begin with, in order to shoehorn her into being some kind of late game carry and ignoring the identity she's had for a good while now.\nAlso anyone that liked bruiser eve and didn't go full fotm got boned.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Slamurai Jack","date":"2015-10-28T07:30:00.272+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"Her winrate went down a whopping 0.7% with the most recent nerf.
