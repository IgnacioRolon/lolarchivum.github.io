Our thresh kept raging at me and kept calling me bad as he looked up my rank and kept bming. I asked him for a 1v1 mirror as anivia. He laughed and accepted, and our mid laner, who I didn't know at the time was plat 4(i'm silver 1) asked to 1v1 too. So after losing the game(sadly) our thresh set up a game for a 1v1 of me vs our ahri as anivia. The whole time as he set up he was laughing at me that I was going to get rekt. End of the 1v1- i got first blood and he appers from the jungle because he was watching and I got a double. Never heard from him again after that","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kuzja1","date":"2015-07-21T01:00:56.598+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To be honest, I use to be cocky. I'm still a little cocky but at least it wasn't as much as when I was younger. But hey, we all use to be that way. That's why we would consider the community from back then to be terrible because majority of us are all cocky or offensive. Back in my days, I like to use the taunt or laugh of any champion I use every time I kill someone. But as I grew older, I realize that doing stuff like that is of course not okay and lacks sportsmanship so I learn to be more friendly towards the others. The only time I ever get cocky is against another cocky player and only a cocky player. If the other team is friendly, or at least not say anything mean, I stay friendly to them as well.\n\nWe all use to be cocky back in the day but we became better players. There's still cocky players here though. But I'd expect them to be mostly younger players who have just reached level 30.\n\nThough I have been getting word that people who play {{champion:55}}  or {{champion:238}}  are very cocky players.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lowvyr","date":"2015-07-20T19:59:28.468+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It seems like 90% of threads somehow devolve to talking about Riven....","replies":[{"poster":"Nuclear Panda","date":"2015-07-20T23:04:06.790+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cuz its riven.
