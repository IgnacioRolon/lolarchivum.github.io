She is op and i would feel ashamed to play her with her ablities, Her Ult, and the black spear. \n\nWhen you can get some AS and MS on Kalista you can weave around Lux's skill shots.\nShe is like old Nidalee in how she can chase and retreat and throw spears.\n2 AAs, rend, spear throw is enough to kill many champs.\nRend can be abused to ks really easily.","replies":[{"poster":"Darkmind1212","date":"2014-12-24T21:52:29.041+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you sure she is op? I mean yes her kit is good vs skill shot bassed champs but ones with auto tracking abilities seem to shut her down hard in lane. Also her attack speed and attack damage are kinda hit and miss early to mid game.","replies":[]}]}
