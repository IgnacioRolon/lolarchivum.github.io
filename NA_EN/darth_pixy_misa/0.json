I guess old bros aren't adjusting to her new kit very well.\n\nFew things I'd suggest bearing in mind when looking at stats like these:\n\n* Almost every champion's win rate converges towards 50% by game length eventually, simply because the only games that go long are those where both teams are pretty evenly matched. Individual power curve will modify that somewhat, particularly for champions that are absolute early or late game monsters.\n* Win rate by number of games played is going to be misleading if a champion's had significant recent changes. A lot of those games may have been on previous versions of the champion. Players on their 137th game might be going through some learning curve again for example, rather than being representative of someone who's got a strong handle on the new state of the champion in question. \n* Champions that are more team comp specific will sometimes have lower win rates at high play numbers than expected.  That can be the result of people that want to play a particular champion picking them regardless of whether they're a good fit for the game or not.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"President FkBoi","date":"2015-06-03T04:11:40.002+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I made a post earlier, and I was wondering if you could comment.

That being said, homogeneity is a pretty big problem in the roster right now--an understatement, honestly--so I'm pretty happy that this is finally starting to be addressed. \n\n(Of course, Tristana's also pretty good at killing non-tower things, but the fact that towers can't really back away to prevent her bomb from getting charged up makes using it against them much more reliable)","replies":[]},{"poster":"YourSh4dow","date":"2015-06-03T06:14:01.543+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I get that Q might be too strong vs towers post lvl 6 but why would you nerf already low dmg W (Volley)?? that 20 dmg does makes quite difference since it has such large cooldown early.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SpaceWeeds","date":"2015-06-03T23:37:23.172+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":0,"body":"GGWP.","replies":[]},{"poster":"lDontLiftIcarry","date":"2015-06-03T16:25:55.865+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"why gut ashe  rework at all meddler.\nJinx is still broken as shit.\nTheres still; zero reasons to pick ashe outside of a different pick for once.\n\nJinx cait Kalisita Lucian Graves every game sure gets fucking boring.\nThey're all the same.\nBroken damage broken mobility or broken aoe.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"rtbf221651412","date":"2015-06-03T00:55:54.333+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":9,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Its Spongebob,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=kjjEEb2Q,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-06-03T00:29:51.972+0000)\n>\n> well maybe, the problem is that she offers much more utility than those 2 adcs, plus that's their general trademark; they eat threw towers.
