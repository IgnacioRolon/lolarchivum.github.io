Yesterday when I tried to login I received a message saying that my acc name or password does not match.. I have never had this problem before and I didn't change my password or acc name.. And more than that, when I try to find my acc on op.gg, it says that my acc doesn't exist.. I play on BR server and i posting this here because I can't access my acc to post in the BR forum.. Has this ever happened to one of you guys? \r\nThank in advance and sorry about my english, not my first language.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-08T19:39:03.555+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If your patcher is set to the proper region but still failing to login, then our [account recovery](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751694-Recovering-Your-Account) guide could help towards recovery.
