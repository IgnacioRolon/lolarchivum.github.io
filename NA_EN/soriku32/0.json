Game stats or LP can't be adjusted, and the system will treat these cases equally because they still cause others a negative experience even if it wasn't intentional.  I need more information to understand what's going on though, like what you mean exactly by crashed.  Did you get any error messages?  What are you seeing and when is it happening?  Let me know!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Soriku32","date":"2016-09-22T18:02:55.805+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It only happened one time. My league froze.
