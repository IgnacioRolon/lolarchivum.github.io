The only one Kalista might be \"safe\" from is Olaf. But he's...Olaf. XD She doesn't have a knock-up ult. She gives her support a knock-up, and the difference is extremely important. And no, Rend doesn't mean she has to use 3/4 of the autoattacks of any other ADC to kill you, because they have steroids, too — bigger ones, that let you kill her long before Rend stacks high enough to kill you, and they do their damage up-front, so you can never just flash away at the last second, because the damage is already done. I can't stress this point enough: every other ADC has MORE damage output than Kalista. More, not less. All of them. Yes, even after Rend — which, by the way, she loses if she ever misses a kill. Sated Devourer might help her catch up, but otherwise...nah. Kalista falls off HARD in the late game. This was true BEFORE they nerfed her autoattack damage scaling, and it's even more true now.\n\nVoid Staff only ignores 35% of their MR. The other 65% will still reduce Nidalee's damage by quite a bit. And here's the thing. Void staff does nothing against health, and health itemization out-paces her AP scaling. She can't whittle down that health if she can't hit with her javelins. Even if she throws them from out of sight, she gives away her position, and won't hit more than one. Finally, the obvious AP answer to stacking health, Liandry's Torment, is something Nidalee struggles to use effectively, due to her complete lack of CC. I will say that \"useless\" was certainly hyperbole, but she is definitely at an extreme disadvantage against anyone who builds, say, Veil or Visage. The only way she can overcome this is to build tank herself, use Rylai's or Iceborn to keep Liandry's burning strong, and hope to out-sustain them. If she does this, she sacrifices damage overall for frontline presence. There are ALWAYS tradeoffs.\n\nAhri was what?! -checks- Holy wow. That's a thing. Okay. Seems fun. Her scalings are mediocre, so I guess she needs that. Also, repositioning to guide the return shot. Makes sense.\n\nLee Sin has % MISSING health damage. An execute. Which is...not really damage.

You just have to aim where she's going to be, not where she is. She can't change direction mid-dash, and her dash has a wind-up. This is in contrast with Vayne, who can dash instantly almost at will. Kalista stands a very good chance of dodging slow-moving skillshots, but they can still be used to zone her out of positions where she can effectively deal damage.\n\n**\"No ADC falls off late game, lol. The point is to be the carry for the late game.\"**\n\nWell, that's the problem, isn't it? She is the exception to the rule that defines her role. She doesn't have good range like Ashe, Caitlyn, Kog'Maw, and Tristana. She doesn't have attack speed steroids like Ashe, Jinx, Kog'Maw, Tristana, or Twitch. She doesn't have a direct AD steroid like Twitch or Vayne (her closest comparisons — incidentally, they both have stealth, too). In fact, now the AD she does build is dampened. She has Yasuo crits without the better crit chance, and even her non-crit attacks are weakened. She can't do a crit build nearly as well as anyone else, as a result, and she has to build lots of attack speed and raw damage to take full advantage of the unique strengths she does have. Not being able to pull off crit means that yes, her damage falls off late game. Basically the entire reason crit exists is to make sure the ADC can keep being a damage threat in the late game, and Kalista can't pull it off. She's built to reward prolonged combat presence, and her damage pressure is outclassed by everyone else in her role past level 5. She needs to get a lead in the laning phase and keep it long enough to win. The longer a game goes on, the worse her chances. This got a little better when Sated Devourer became an option, because she gets extra Rend stacks and she can secure dragon to actually GET Sated, but it's still not as good as a crit build on someone with high attack speed built into their kit or free AD (or both...Ashe, Twitch, I'm looking at you).\n\nAs for Nidalee, if it makes you feel any better, the PBE currently has her javelin base damage reduced above rank 1 (rank 5 is 130/390 max, down from 150/450), and cast time DOUBLED (now 0.25 sec) so it should be much easier to react.

His Q can interrupt channels. You know.. Like, 4 abilities. Fiddle, Nunu, Anivia, Galio, Malzahar, Karthus (If he's stupid enough to R when not dead or close enough for a Kassadin to Q), Shen (If he's for some reason against a Kass in lane and doesn't walk away from Kass to press R?), Janna, WW, and Lucian. So... 10 abilities, but because it 'prevents an ability/action', it's apparently considered hard CC. lol. It doesn't stop Lux's channel though. Toggles like Karthus' E and Mao's R as well as Tethers like Morg and Karma's aren't stopped, but hey. It can stop the Galio if he manages to cast it right before Galio presses R or if he's stupid enough to be within range of Lucian's R or if he's not the target of Malz's R! It stops WW's R, which is nice I suppose and for those rare occasions there's a Nunu or if the enemy Fiddle is just that stupid he's going to ult with a Kass right there. lol. :P\n\nHonestly though, Kass just gets shafted because he's supposed to be an Anti-Mage, yet his only anti-mage bits in his kit are his Q's shield and his passive. His Q can interrupt, but most of them he'll never get to interrupt. A Karthus knows to not R near a Kass, as does a Shen, Anivia already got her R off to slow him to be able to press E anyways, Galio isn't exactly easy to hit with it since you're likely going to be caught IN his R, and overall, it's just too situational now, ESPECIALLY compared to the old silence he had. Riot hates that Kass does everything but be an Anti-Mage, yet all they gave him was a shield and some damage resistance to it. His old kit, he absorbed 15% and turned it into Attack Speed for his W while his Q could silence and give him a shield while his mobility was the best mage-murdering tool around, dodging skill shots like no other. Now? He has a bubble, 15% reduced magic damage taken, and an interrupt... Nothing says Anti-Mage about that at all. It says 'I can ignore your mage to dive your ADC instead.' Like, seriously. \n\nWe have two other Anti-Mages, one being a tank, and BOTH gain DAMAGE against Mages. Veig does damage based on his opponents AP and Galio gains damage for building Magic Resist. Kass gains nothing over a mage. He has the damage resistance to make it through the laning phase, but his ratios are so garbage, he won't out scale the enemies and his mobility only lasts for a couple jumps before it's his ENTIRE mana bar being used and he gains almost no damage off these stacks anymore. We're better off simply removing the cool down reduction it gets as he levels and removing the mana cost boost while up'ing its base cast to, say, 200 mana at 1, 175 at 2, 150 at 3. This way, it's still gated by mana, but it's not, 'You get 3 jumps, now you have to wait 15s.'. Just make the damn CD as 10s and cut the boosted costs. He'll scale with Mana Regen and CDR now, he won't be one shotting carries, and he'll keep his mobility. Win-win situation.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ElJanitorFrank","date":"2015-07-28T19:46:58.541+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Vayne is considered mobile now?","replies":[{"poster":"CancerNoobUseles","date":"2015-07-28T19:53:38.941+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"ElJanitorFrank","date":"2015-07-28T20:19:06.265+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think I've played Vayne one time in my years of playing League of Legends.\n\nBut obviously, everyone who disagrees with you is only doing it from a defensive prospective, right?

Her Q gives her a movement speed buff that decays, and if she spams it early game without a mana item, she can quickly lose the mana. Her Ultimate comes on a fairly high cooldown, and gives her 3 dashes with some damage.\n\nI personally like Ahri simply because while she was mobility, It's not like she's Kalista and uses it constantly all game long. Ahri conserves her mobility for when she knows she'll need it. And even then, there's counterplay to the rest of her kit.\n\nBut yeah gut Fizz.","replies":[]}]}
