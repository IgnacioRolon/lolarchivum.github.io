Seriously, these two have been in the gutter as far as botlane is concerned for months (when {{champion:236}} was good recently, it was midlane), and the champions that were currently kicking her teeth in ({{champion:21}}, {{champion:81}}) have gotten several nerfs since the preseason began (both directly and indirectly). She has times where she&#039;s in a decent spot, sure, but in a world where lane bullies and poke isn&#039;t strong, her items are cheap, I would expect {{champion:67}} to be coming out on top.\r\n\r\nI feel like the solution would be to make the other options stronger, but even then, I&#039;m not sure how possible it is to do that without making them busted with the state the marksman class as a whole is in right now.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think? Would you rather she get direct nerfs, or make the champions best at putting her in her place... actually decent at doing that again?","replies":[{"poster":"Niyume","date":"2018-01-07T23:13:52.210+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Vayne has been broken since her release.
