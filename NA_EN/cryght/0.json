I play my champion and every so often when im fighting or moving my champion either stops in place or keeps moving forward ignoring my clicks to move back or even attack.. i had one game where i had to watch as my champion got slain while i was clicking furiously to try to make it back away or even use flash etc.. but nothing just complete and utter ignoring my commands..  I've updated my graphics card, thinking thats the problem... but it still seems to want to ignore me often...","replies":[{"poster":"ddevildude","date":"2017-09-24T04:11:05.009+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Similar problem, but noticed when I go on to my phones wifi Hotspot , the problem disappeared.\n\nOn the other hand, everything else works fine on my isp connection including 4k streams.
