Sometimes it locks up so badly that mouse input is lagged to hell and the sound is all garbled. My PC becomes completely unresponsive during this time to the point that I have to power it off by hand.\r\n\r\nThis wasn't an issue until patch 6.20 came out. Any ideas on how to fix this, or should I play another game until Season 7?","replies":[{"poster":"xomp","date":"2016-10-17T23:00:04.382+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So are we going to pretend that the Xbox thing is the end-all be-all culprit of this random freezing even though that's not the case? I'm trying my hardest to enjoy this 10min Leaver buster for my next 5 games because of it. Call me a prick, but it's not very fun or fair considering it was a bot game that I managed to reconnect to, play the last 10mins to victory and game ended....

Maybe it's a problem with some new particals or something. Riot is absolutely apathetic to the situation.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-15T21:45:07.456+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, this has been an ongoing problem with a recent Windows 10 update.

What if I told you that I went as far as to check the registry values listed in your link and one didn't even exist and the other was set to \"off\" already? Is there anything else causing this that you're aware of that I can look into?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-18T16:32:47.853+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The problem is that the update auto-enabled the Xbox Game Bar for a lot of players even if you didn't have an account.

No other games cause my system to crash like LoL does so I'm not convinced it's an issue with my hardware or software at this point.\n\nIt was one hell of a ride but I'm aight.
