I suggest going over the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to troubleshoot and find the block.  You can also download our [hextech repair tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367) to auto-configure your firewall settings incase that could be the culprit.

Even though your internet can seem fine, it doesn't make you immune from reaching specific servers- in this case pvp.net.  You'll want to go over each step to resolve whatever is causing you from failing to reach that.  Let me know if that clears things up!.","replies":[{"poster":"Nasuss","date":"2017-05-12T18:20:11.857+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"NVM I FIXED IT , thanks for your effort , its turned out to be a firewall thing , i disabled my wall and bam it worked.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nasuss","date":"2017-05-12T18:03:51.534+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i did most of them  (took alot of time tho) , but my norton antivirus expired so i just uninstalled it and after day or so this happened .. maybe this have something to do with this .. although i already made my firewall exception league and all it stuff .. its only pvp.net not connecting/something blocking it idk why.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
