I have discord running and talking to people the whole time while my champ freezes up and I see everyone else running around on my screen. It only lasts about 20 or so seconds but happens multiple times through out the game. \r\nI have run the hextech repair tool and it says my connection is fine. Is this a packet loss deal? \r\n\r\nAny advice or help is appreciated! \r\n\r\nSide note my friend is also having the same issue, hopefully the advice here can help him too!\r\n\r\nThanks in advance {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-11T02:02:11.423+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This might very well be a case of packet loss if you already know your connection is running pretty solid.

Here is the screen shot of when I uploaded the logs, I don't know what is happening but every game I d/c at least once. http://imgur.com/ApiBJo7","replies":[]}]}]}
