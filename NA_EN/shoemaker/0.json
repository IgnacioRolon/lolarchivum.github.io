If they play like that you can win if you play passiv and farm and get your gold for items but ... i think that it really sucks if you have to play like that.  And its kind of shit that there are champs which nobody plays because they get destroyed in normals like nunu or some other champs. I liked eve pretty much but i cant play her in normals because she ist to weak to go top with her and the new jungle just smash her. \n\n\nIf its possible it would be awesome if there would be a mode where you cant play metachamps or just these assasins / burster. Only \"Oldtimers\". That would be really interesting. :3","replies":[]},{"poster":"Droogzy","date":"2014-12-26T03:48:04.247+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Very difficult for both teams to have fun when there's a clear winner and loser.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cale017","date":"2014-12-25T19:48:13.214+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Or you can remember that what you deem as fun isn't what others deem as fun.
