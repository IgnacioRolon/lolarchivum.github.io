Earlier I had lag spikes even though my ping and fps display weren't changing much, I was trying to let my team know and they're like \"pfft 80 ping isn't that bad\" even though the entire screen would freeze. That problem hasn't happened today, but instead I'm at a constant 30-40 FPS when I'm usually 60+. My ping is stable at 28, but when I roll my screen over around the map the visuals feel clunky. Restarting the client and restarting my computer hasn't fixed it.\r\n\r\nThis issue is also right after the recent Windows 10 update I got last night that installed Paint 3d and whatever the hell else Microsoft decided I need.","replies":[{"poster":"Gemmy51","date":"2017-06-04T03:58:12.430+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/ruxjTmh2-unplayable-fps\n\nSame here...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Draconic PoweR","date":"2017-06-04T03:17:39.375+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm on a MAC (one of the older ones that had a problem launching league, that's fixed now at least) and I too am only getting a constant 30 FPS when i was normally getting 60.
