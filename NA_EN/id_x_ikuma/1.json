But I don't think you're considering the fact that you've already nerfed his ult range and he has a 500 attack range. And in this meta of massive tanks and bursty (and even tankier) mages, how's he gonna fare? It's no wonder he gets picked more because aside from having a strong early game (which honestly I don't find is That impressive, coming from low plat) he's also a safe pick. Caster ADC's are generally irrelevant after 25 minutes or so when tanks get too beefy to burst (your LW items still suck, because it's not Bonus armor that's the problem, it's the massive fucktons of hp and cc to account for in taking down a tank.) Consider this: Maokai is slowly getting out of hand because he can 1v1 a carry late in the game with a visage, thornmail, and rooting every 4 seconds. It already takes 2-3 players to keep that one tank/juggernaut from murdering your carry.\n\nAnywho, no, I don't think the answer is nerfing Lucian, but rather buffing the other carries. It's always \"nerf it\" with you guys except when it came to juggernauts lately, for the most part. Black cleaver became a decent powerspike item that works for a lot of other ADC's besides just Lucian. Just because it's part of a popular Korean build doesn't mean it's suddenly a huge problem. Lucian just works well with it because he can proc its stacks to 30% penetration rather quickly. But again, it's a healthy item for many ADC's in the meta right now, and isn't diversity part of your imaginary slogan? All you're doing is helping force this cookie-cutter Essence reaver garbage build onto him. Cooldown's great, but he can also get that cooldown and more attack damage for cheaper.
