For starters, your analogy of verbal abuse equating to molestation is probably one of the greatest examples of false equivalency and slippery slope that I've seen. Whereas one is a crime, the other is covered under free speech, and no laws can compel a company to enforce a standard for what people can or can't say. Additionally, with regards to lawsuits, the Terms of Use mandates that aggrieved individuals work with Riot Games through arbitration first, but even then, your argument has no grounds. But as a level 12 player talking about your experiences in ranked, you clearly switched accounts to post one hell of a troll thread.","replies":[{"poster":"OnlyYouCanHearMe","date":"2017-04-21T22:37:35.989+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"^choking^ I am so glad I was not drinking when I read this.... still laughing... can't breathe...

Riot is even doing more than many gaming companies or internet forums by having a behavioral punishment system in the first place. They can't proactively prevent abuse short of simply not having a chat system.\n\nLet us know how it goes.","replies":[]},{"poster":"archerno1","date":"2017-04-21T20:03:15.918+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rofl","replies":[]},{"poster":"Soulhavok","date":"2017-04-22T23:59:24.615+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Calm down and try rewriting this post so it makes a lick of sense.

You're most likely behaving antisocially to your team and making them dislike you instead of trying to work together with people. \n\nIf it works, why not do it in team ranked instead of solo/duo queue? \n\nThere's a disconnect not only in your logic but the facts you present. \n\nWhat is with this recent upsurge of troll posts about lawsuits and alleging Riot is harassing them?
