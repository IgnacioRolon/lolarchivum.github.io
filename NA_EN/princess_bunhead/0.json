No idea, really - but as a player who found S5 to be the most enjoyable season by far, I&#039;m gonna give it a go anyways!\n\n1. Remove all the keystones - balance around champions instead. Let us choose a 3/2/1 setup from minor runes from different rune paths. This should alleviate a good bit of the burst and cancerous playstyles - also make Zed actually have to land his abilities! :P And as a bonus, should make the game far easier to balance in the long run.\n\n2. Remove Duskblade dmg addition, maybe replace it with something \"visiony\", due to later mentioned vision ward changes. Remove Stormrazor completely. Revert Essence Reaver changes. Balance accordingly.\n\n3. Nerf pure tanks damage, but increase their survivability. Plenty of ways to do this healthily.\n\n4. Lower plating gold some, and keep them the whole game. Possibly have plating on inhibitor and nexus turrets also. Should make the game longer, and have IE/ER + Zeal item upgrade be doable again on &quot;standard&quot; ADCs. Maybe radically buff nexus turret dmg.\n\n5. &quot;Un-buff&quot; ignite.\n\n6. Reinstate season 5 vision trinket upgrades and possibly boot enchants.\n\n7. Slow down on the minions winning games please.\n\n_____\n\nUnsure of:\n\n1. Shutdown gold - I had a game where we were at a 4k gold disadvantage, but then we got some lucky shutdowns and objectives, and we suddenly had a 3,2k goldlead within 5 minutes. Don&#039;t know if that&#039;s all that healthy tbh - but maybe spread the shut down out over &quot;multiple&quot; kills could help that.\n\n_____\n\nAnd a few pet peeves of mine I&#039;d like see changed, but are not to be taken too seriously:\n\n1. Nerf high mobility users some, please - high mobility while sacrificing nothing, damage/survivability wise is just stupid.\n\n2. Nerf Akali&#039;s new shroud to regular stealth. Then balance around that - we dont need more frustration in this game.\n\n3. Revert Malzahar completely and THEN &quot;Annie&quot; him instead.\n\n4. Griveous wounds - can we just remove this crap, and rebalance problematic champions around that instead, as GW is the difference of those champions being OP or UP in the same game - why not the golden middle road?","replies":[{"poster":"qewqewqewqew","date":"2018-11-24T14:23:33.871+0000","up_votes":36,"down_votes":1,"body":"1.

You don't see Soraka, which her only purpose in the game IS healing, strong. Because gw exists.

Reduce her healing and Soraka has..a silence that can be avoided if you get a lucky time between ticks with a root that screams \"get away from here before \nI can root you\" and a hard to land slow? Heals should be something the champion is balanced around, not something you can negate (effectively negating a positive balance lever of the champion). I think it's the same reason magic resist is more effective against a mage that armor is against an adc: as much as I'm pissed about it, even if I can't one shot an enemy I can still aoe slow, root, shield my whole team and give vision from afar.. if armor negated an adc the same way mr can negate a mage you might as well pick Ashe every single game as evey other adc most positive balance lever (aka their damage) would be able to be negated.","replies":[{"poster":"Eleshakai","date":"2018-11-26T15:24:16.543+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, you don't see Soraka strong because she's super-squishy, extremely hard to coordinate a team around, enchanters are in-general weak in the current gamestate, she has no reliable self-sustain, and her healing hurts her, making her even squishier.\n\nIt's not because of GW. Even with GW, her healing is still reasonable, she just dies once she starts using it.\n\nIf a mechanic has no counterbalancing lever to it, then you CAN'T have a champion entirely based around it, or else that champion just becomes passively overpowered as there's nothing the enemy team can do about it. That's why it's a problem that Riot's been making everything knockups lately.

If you give all those weaknesses to a champion as a cost for his main strength and than give a way to hard counter that very strength why would that champion ever be picked? Jinx (first that came to mind) for example is dependant only on damage. She is super squishy, immobile except for a very conditional ms buff and her only ccs are both hard to land and have a high cd. Yet she can be picked when you want a late game carry that deals huge amounts of damage. Because that's her strength, and it can't be ignored. It's balanced around the fact that even through resists you will still be affected by her high damage. Soraka heals may not be THAT bad per se, even though gw, but they become so when you consider all that she gives up for them (she SHOULD be an overpowered healer since she suffers from all this negatives for it. That's how you would balance her). For the rest of sustain champion their sustain could be reduced since they have other strong points  (or reduce the other strong point if it's wished they remain a strong healer).  Knock UPS are way worse imho than healing because no matter how strong healing is it can still be countered with burst. That's what I like less about gw I suppose: It reduces healing in the situation it should be strongest  (prolonged fight), still does nothing to alleviate the miserable experience of trying to poke down a sustaining lane opponent, leading to situations where it feels too weak vs situation where it feels overbearing.

My argument was that my team won multiple teamfights but because of how minions scale now if you're able to win a single teamfight late, you're able to comeback from nothing. It's not very fun.

I don't want runes to be removed. Balancing around champions only would be boring and I would probably quit the game. The game is boring enough as it is. They should be changed though and be unique, just like kleptomancy and glacial augument. Those keystones that give more dmg are stupid, braindead and broken. Those should be completely removed.\n\n2. Completely agree.\n\n3. Not really easy to do. If you remove dmg from them, nobody would play them. They are boring even now and they were boring in tank meta. I think they should introduce more active items for tanks or rework tanks into more utility champions, that have auras. Aura would increase stats like ms for other champions or maybe they should be more engaging and disengaging, so that tank players feel like useful and having fun.\n\n4. I would rather just buff towers. They are dying too fast. In an equal match, my yi top pushed all the towers with his attack speed and just ended the game solo. There was nothing the enemy team could do. He was just melting them.\n\n5. Completely agree. Also revert tp changes and introduce a new summoner spell. Preferably a summoner spell that teleports you to a nearby ally. It can create some outplay potential in bot lane. Right now bot lane is braindead.\n\n6. Agree or they should just introduce new trinkets, that would work in various ways. We could use some trinkets that would follow the enemy around, like that one from wolves in S5.\n\n7. If they buff towers it would get fixed itself.\n\nI would really love if riot gave us more outplay POTENTIAL, not outplay BUTTONS like R on Karthus and Zed for example. R that buffs a champion or changes its playstyle is ok, but an ultimate ability that just kills you is not. Actually Zed is a bad example, you can just flash his abilities, but there are many champions that just click R and kill you (Veigar, Syndra). \n\nBut champions like that are Akali and Irelia and we hate them. Mostly because they need a nerf and they are not getting it. Akali is banned in 60-70% of matches and Irelia is obviously too strong. Both are well designed, but poorly balanced. That nerf for Akali's W was actually pretty good and maybe she needs just a little bit extra changes and shifts in damage, so that she won't be banned as much.\n\nI honestly think that Zoe, Akali and Irelia are well designed. Just balanced really poorly. Zoe does too much dmg from that W. E and Q are easy to dodge, but her W does a lot of damage and cannot be dodged. She also gets free stuff from it. Irelia is doing a lot of dmg and it wouldn't be that bad if her stun wasn't so easy to hit. She can place it behind her and then just jump to a dying minion and hit it perfectly. Nothing really difficult about that. With her skill set I would expect at least this ability to be difficult in use.\n\nAbout Malza.

It's not just the pre-season. Many players who had a positive attitude a year ago, are frustrated and cynical by now. I don't feel like Riot's intention with these changes is aimed at player experience at all.
