Nothing against the English VO just curious if anyone else felt the same. \r\n\r\nI just saw the behind the scenes video for the Riot Japan and the interviews with some of the voice actors. (Linked the video incase you guys have no clue what I&#039;m talking about).","replies":[{"poster":"Vicvictorw","date":"2015-10-20T03:46:42.754+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://lexwah.com/lvoc/\n\nThrough a quick Google search, though I can't confirm it's legit.\n\nPoint is, the language pack should already be in the client.
