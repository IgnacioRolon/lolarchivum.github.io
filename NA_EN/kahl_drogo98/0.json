I was just wondering if there was a fix for this because i disconnected and reconnected and they still weren't working. I also jumped into a practice tool session a couple times after that game and they sill weren't working. And on top of that it wouldn't even let me change the binding to a different key (I tried pressing a different key that wasn't already bound and it didn't work)","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-20T04:47:07.461+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sounds like your keybinding configurations might have been messed up somehow.
