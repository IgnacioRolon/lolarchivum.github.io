In my last game of the night, I got an S and someone else on my team also got an S. Today, when I logged in, I noticed that I did not receive a chest for the S from last night. I don't think I received a chest for this champion before. I even went though all the champions that I have received a chest for and noticed that there is one chest/reward missing. Usually the box shows up immediately after the game. So is there something that can be done or maybe I'm completely mistaken. Any help will be useful.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-28T21:45:43.218+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A good way to know if you've already obtained a chest for a champion is by sorting through the Champion tab of your profile.  Any chests earned will wrap a champion icon with a gold border.  Earning chests have a bit of requirements, like owning the champion and having a slot available to earn one.  You can check to see if you have an available slow on your profile, next to your ARAM reroll counter.  Each slot should refresh by one roughly each week. \n\nMore information on this is also available at our[ champion mastery](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204211284-Champion-Mastery-Guide) guide.  I hope that helps clear some things up!","replies":[{"poster":"Hardybook","date":"2016-07-28T22:43:48.908+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for your response. I did all that you said and the numbers still don't add up for the amount of gold borders that I have and the amount of chests/rewards that I have (17 gold borders and only 16 boxes/rewards). Also, my profile still shows me able to get 4 more chests even though I should have received one last night. The champion was Taliyah and I think I had only played her once before last night (and I highly doubt I would have gotten an S with her the first time playing). Thanks again for responding.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-28T23:10:19.396+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It looks like you've already received a chest for Talyiah back in June, in thanks to your premade.   Please let me know if that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"Hardybook","date":"2016-07-29T01:50:11.508+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That helps a ton and makes a ton more sense!
