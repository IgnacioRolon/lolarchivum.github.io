Since you're seeing spikes of 1130ms inside your network, I'd recommend rebooting your Asus router by unplugging it for 60 seconds, then plugging it back in.\n\nIf you still experience these issues after rebooting your router, run another traceroute log with WinMTR and hit me back with the results.","replies":[]}]}
