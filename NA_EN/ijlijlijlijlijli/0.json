It's called preseason for a reason. They're ensuring they have time to make any adjustments as players make adjustments to their playstyles and learn the rune setups they'll need to play. If you follow any LCS you'll have a good idea when it'll ramp up again and you can begin placements. I'm sure Riot will announce the beginning before you can actually start placements again.","replies":[{"poster":"IJLIJLIJLIJLIJLI","date":"2017-11-21T19:55:34.691+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Kantala,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=pVcetlrE,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-11-21T19:38:00.649+0000)\n>\n> No. Nobody gets placement matches as we are currently in preseason.
