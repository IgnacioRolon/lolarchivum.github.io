I don't want to butcher any champion and i want most of these to be viable. my main focus is the easy champions that everyone wonders why people even play. These are the champions you mained when you were lv1-15, because they worked for you. For most of then i'll explain why i thought these were smart.\r\n\r\nWith reasonable commentary encouraged... hear we go.\r\n\r\n{{champion:55}} Her passive only applies to her ult OR Shunpo's damage resistance ONLY applies to targeted opponent. \r\n\r\nHer ult is what makes her Kat so why nerf that, and she's an assassin so 1v1 is her thing\r\n\r\n{{champion:11}} Alpha strike no longer applies crit. Wuju Style no longer applies true damage but the AD ratio is increased to 30% from 20%. \r\n\r\nhe has enough attack speed to apply cries for days why add more. true damage is awesome but with this many attacks per second its kinda op,  and on top of that it scales with his AD. i say leave the true damage to {{champion:39}} \r\n\r\n{{champion:9}} Dark wind's ap ratio is dropped to 40% from 45%\r\n\r\nSilence is being removed from everyone, so i wouldn't touch his. \r\n\r\n{{champion:23}} mocking shout's effects dropped to 20/30/40/50/60 AD reduction and 30/35/40/45/50% movement speed reduction.\r\n\r\ni wanted to touch his ult but its what makes him a berserker. Most non-assassin champions have a max ad of 240 (mid-game) when he drops your ad down to less then 1/3 of its original value your gonna be in a world of hurt for the next 4 seconds, by which point your going to wanna run and the slow is just annoying on top of that, trust me i hate cowards, but we are talking about a guy who has made a deal with Death its self.\r\n\r\n{{champion:19}} hungering strike AP ratio reduced to 85% from 100%\r\n\r\nwhen he deals a base damage AND % of health based entirely off of his AP... plus he can already hunt you down and gut your like a worm.\r\n\r\n{{champion:17}}  blinding dart's AP ratio reduced to 75%\r\n\r\nWish i could think of more but he's everyones favorite yordle... almost everyone's. \r\n\r\n{{champion:13}} Rune prisons base damage reduced to 40/70/100/125/150 and its ap ratio reduced to 50% \r\n\r\nIts damage just seems a little to high for a target snare.\r\n\r\n{{champion:75}} wither's slow debuff reduced to 40/47/55/67/80 and its CD increased to 19/18/17/16/15.\r\n\r\nthis slow is one of the most painful things to witness in game to be honest.. for you and your allies\r\n\r\n{{champion:24}} Ad ratios reduced by 15% and drop the bonus passive damage on third hit (granted by his ult) to 100/145/190.\r\n\r\nHe's the grandmaster with a lamp post... and yet a dragon(shivana) deals less damage then him. \r\n\r\n{{champion:86}} judgements damage reduced by 3% per unit in area double for enemy champions(6%) (maximum reduced damage 25%)\r\n\r\nFor a no mana fighter/tank that costs only 450ip he's extremely heavy in damage even when full tank.\r\n\r\n{{champion:105}} Urchin strike no longer applies on hit effects and playful/trickster still dodges cc and skill shots... but he can now be effected by single target spells and basic attacks.\r\n\r\ni still love him and i haven't hurt him bad but i have brought him down to size with most assassins\r\n\r\n{{champion:114}} Riposte CD increased by 6 but is reduced by 1 upon being damaged by a basic attack. burst of speed's attack speed bonus reduced by 20%\r\n\r\nThe CD just makes sense to a duelists ability to read movement in the midst of a fight, and burst of speeds bonus of 110% attack speed is Yi worthy, and just seems a little nuts for a basic ability.\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for reading this and Thank you for your consideration!!!","replies":[{"poster":"InvalidGuest","date":"2014-11-12T03:58:15.744+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"You think {{champion:9}} {{champion:86}} and{{champion:17}} need nerfs... god.","replies":[{"poster":"CrimsonRakan","date":"2014-11-12T07:14:46.868+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Fiddle and Teemos can be waved but garen is a huge threat in the league and more being so cheep (in more ways then 1) would like to see more balance.","replies":[{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2014-11-12T07:36:33.639+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Garen being nerfed would remove him from the game even more so than he already is.","replies":[{"poster":"CrimsonRakan","date":"2014-11-12T07:48:33.072+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What if the base damage on his E was raised as counter.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"DarthSpectrum","date":"2014-11-12T04:20:59.208+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"OP champions are a very touchy subject; if you bring up nerfs to so many of them at once, expect to get down voted into oblivion.\n\nOn a side note, I completely agree with most of your changes.

Nerfing a champion that NEVER gets pro play and isn't even a pub stompper. Makes no sense.\n\nNTM he is a great low level champ as he teaches positioning. No gap closers and no CC cept a silence means he can only run at you and also means you have to think about setting up kills with positioning and deception, and have to learn how to safe farm/ tower farm early, as top lane, the only place he can go, is a bunch of ranged champs now. Also he is hugely farm/item dependent leaving him little opportunity to roam and help his team.\n\nAnd in case you didn't know, Atama's is getting removed from the game. A huge nerf for Garen as he is the main user of Atama's and also because Atama's is much better than IE on Garen.\n\nMany people think IE is good but Garen has an interesting mechanic that allows low Crit chance to be very effective and stacking Crit Chance/Dmg on him is less efficient. \n\nHis main damage is his spin which hits 6 times and each hit can crit. However the crits are only half crits. Low crit is better since 1-2 of 6 will crit every time with only an Atama's and when it does crit it is only 150% dmg instead of the standard 200% crit dmg. IE increases his spin crit dmg from 150% to 175%, not that big of an increase in dmg. Waste of most of the reason for getting IE, and losing out on Atama's Tank stats for very little dmg increase compared to Atama's.\n\n**MATH**\nLets say IE's crit rate adds 1/6 more crit hits than Atama's per spin. Reasonable as IE is usually 2-3 per 6 and Atama's is 1-2 per 6. Consider that they are only half crits tho. \n\nLOW END --- 1 crit for Atama's, 2 for IE\nATAMA --- SPIN DMG x (1+(.5 x .16666)) = 1.0833333\nIE --- SPIN DMG x (1+(.75 x .33333)) = 1.25\n\nHIGH END --- 2 crits for Atama's, 3 for IE\nATAMA --- SPIN DMG x (1+(.5 x .33333)) = 1.1666666\nIE --- SPIN DMG x (1+(.75 x .50000)) = 1.375\n\nYes IE does slightly more dmg, but is it gold efficient? Absolutely NOT. Atama's 2300g vs IE's 3800g. 1500g for slightly more dmg and way less tankiness. Much wasted monies.\n\nAlso due to the way the game adds % crit chance to the next hit when you miss a crit, and the fact that Garen has low crit dmg but multiple quick hits means Atama's gets 2 of 6 crits a big portion of the time but IE also gets 2 most of the time.\n\nOnly thing left unaccounted for is the DMG of the two items. Hard to compare since IE is flat AD and Atama's scales, but by late-mid/end game, no matter the build, the scaling AD of Atama's gets close enough to IE to make the dmg difference negligible. The tank stats difference is obv in Atama's favor. Only way IE could be good would be with an IE rush but then that means your not rushing Black Cleaver which is also much better than IE on Garen since his spin stacks the BC % Armor Pen.\n\nOh how I hate IE on Garen, yet now we might be forced to buy it as most other Crit items have AS which is mostly wasted stats on Garen.\n\nNo more Atama's means Garen is getting a HUGE nerf and he doesn't even need one.\n\nTBH with Atama's getting removed, if anything, Garen will need a slight buff. Most certainly doesn't need a nerf after Atama's is gone.","replies":[{"poster":"CrimsonRakan","date":"2014-11-12T20:18:56.072+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"now these are the comments i enjoy, thank you for your input. now that you have explained that... what of the other ideas?
