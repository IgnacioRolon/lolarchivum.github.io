Then suddenly the &quot;Accept&quot; (match) dialog popped up and I accepted the match.\r\nAfter the match I checked for the skin but I don&#039;t have it unlocked...\r\nAlso, the &quot;Upgrade to skin permanent&quot; button is not available any more from the skin shard and I think I&#039;m missing yellow essence, too (not 100% sure about that).\r\nPlease help!\r\nThanks in advance for your effort!","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-08-04T00:15:48.376+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey! \n\nThanks for the report! \n\nDid you check your inventory after logging out and logging back in?
