Just enter the Username and Password and simply log in without any trouble. However, within the past couple of months this computer has had a \"mac address changer\" used on it by some others who used this computer. Now, I am required to use a VPN to login into the LoL servers as well as other games like CSGO. If anybody has had this issue or knows of any way to fix the effects of this mac address changer, please help. Thanks\r\n\r\n~~~","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-07T21:03:34.353+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If this computer is something like a school computer where an Admin set up those mac addresses you may need to contact them first to make any changes. If it's your personal pc, I wouldn't want you do try and make these changes without knowing 100% how to do it, so let's get you in touch with our tech guys. \n\nHit us up in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new), and they should be able to walk you through getting everything back in place!","replies":[]}]}
