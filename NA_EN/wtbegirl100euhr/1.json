Your MMR increases each time you win, and will continue to do so unless you lose (for that game it goes down). As you start playing against better opponents your winrate will go down, until it stabilises at around 50%. That's what the term means. \r\n\r\nI see a lot \"Oh, match making wants me to lose this game because I've won some\".\r\n\r\nNo. Your opponents get better, your teammates get better. At the same rate.\r\n\r\nWhy do you have to play against plats/dia when you're gold? Because you have high plat/dia MMR and so those are the opponents the system thinks you can beat. You'll climb in that situation with a 50% winrate because that's how LP/gains losses work. Or are at least supposed to work, bugs with positional matchmaking LP gains notwithstanding. \r\n\r\nMatch-making is trying to put you in games at your skill level. You'll probably find that a lot of you have games just like the ones you complain about your team having, or are making other critical errors in your gameplay and just don't want to admit that the idiot that is 0/10 at 10 minutes into Nasus is the same skill level as you.\r\n\r\nMMR isn't perfect and could definitely do with being **visible**. Invisible match-making systems make people suspicious - especially in team-based games when their teammates don't do well every game.","replies":[{"poster":"Asud","date":"2019-02-16T18:57:28.792+0000","up_votes":55,"down_votes":21,"body":"Of course it's forced.\nWhenever i am at lower LP (from 0 to 80) i get teams of all types, good, sometimes bad, most of the time average.

But, i almost never bring that score out of the lane.  On Syndra in lane i will recall 20 times if i have to just so i dont die. Only when the game starts falling apart do i make the desperation play, something i dont even think is gonna work but have to try because otherwise i am going to lose anyway.\n4/9 vlad i remember that one i was against yasuo, i solo killed my lane bully once and was 1/0 then the game started falling apart and i kept trying to make a play but never got lucky or never had enough damage So that score i 100% justified.\nThe next one with 13 deaths is against illaoi top. Since i am physically unable to beat her because im bad at dodging skillshots i was going even in lane maybe losing a bit on cs but nothing big. Then everyone died like twice  so i figured i must make a desperation play all inned her and died. Kindred picked up a kill. What happened after is that Kindred almost carried the game with the kills she got cleaning up the people i got low first so i will justify that one also. I almost made the whole team come back by running in the enemy team making them use everything on me and nuking everyone to 50%hp or less.\nNow i didn't remember 4/10 syndra so i had to look at it. And of course its funny story. I solo killed Malzahar once and helped Lee kill rengar once. Died to Irelia who moved before riven did. So i was 1/1/1 not a bad start for Syndra. What happens next is Thresh isnt happy with his Yasuo adc, he comes to my lane and starts taking all the minions he can. I ask him not to do that to which he replied by running under the tower and giving kill to malzahar, Yasuo inted bot. Thresh inted mid and riven top. I tried to defend to the last minute since it was my promos of course and therefore my score. If you look at damage dealt if would be self explained to you since scores dont actually mean much.\nAlso i ended last season in gold 3, preseason in gold 1 and now i cannot move out of silver because of how lucky i am and because i want to make my goddamn main to work whereas she couldnt work even with 3 buffs as she is the most useless champion in league.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kai Guy","date":"2019-02-16T19:21:42.261+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":7,"body":"MMR systems.

It's practically impossible.\nI ended preseason in Gold 1 so i'm trash but still better that some other lower trash XD.\nI do my provisional, get impossible to carry teams and go 3/7 ending in Silver 1. I dont even get mad its fine. It happens every year in promos, at least to me and my close friends. I'm thinking S1 is fine im not that far away.\nNow what happens is i go into a losing streak in SILVER because no matter how hard i win lane the game collapses on my head with 4 fed enemies. Until i managed to freeze it at Silver 3 0lp, by solo carrying 4 monkeys who got to be 10 times worse than the enemy, every game. It was at this point that i was able to do that. And i start climbing back up.\nThe lanes are easy these guys are bad that im versing, but i'm climbing with like 60% winrate now because the system doesnt allow me to go faster. Just  in case. I win 3 in a row by stomping, Better give him gold enemy bot against a bronze 1 draven, that should fix it. And believe me it does.\nDepending on how concentrated i am and all that, i can beat players from gold to diamond in lane.\nNow im not saying that i deserve diamond, cuz i dont, im bad at some things necessary to have in order to get there.\nBut my point is the entire system is designed around keeping us all down. Now od course TF blade is gonna have 90% winrate til diamond, He is one of the best soloQ players, since my IQ is officially 121 i'm quite sure that guys like TF blade have it at like 140 or something. He stomps low elo games firstly by beating his lane opponent and secondly he beats his opponent with a 1v9 champion like Jax.

It’s just an elo system.  Everyone has hidden MMR points.  When two teams play, the winning team takes points from the losing team.  The matchmaker then makes matches based on the points.\n\nExcept we know thats not entirely how the system works, because as you win above 50% you get worse and worse team mates but as you lose below 50% you get better and better team mates. \n\nThe reason for this is because people on hot streaks are weighted much more heavily than someone on a cold streak. Rather than the system matchmaking in an unbiased way (individual MMR), it eschews quality for speed using team MMR. \nThis creates the pendulum effect that we ALL have experienced. Games are often complete stomps for two or three games, followed by complete stomps in the other direction for two or three games.\n\nPart of that is high ELO though. Riot needs to cap effective MMR at \"Master\" and then just have leaderboards for grand master and challenger based on your uncapped MMR. \nIn the end, thats what those global ranks are anyway. Leaderboards. They could even give rewards based on your leaderboard position! _Like the option to join the tribunal or a lottery to talk to riot in a properly organized professional manner_. \n.... Okay that last one is pretty nonsensical, after what riot did to nightblue.\n\n________________________________________\n\nAlso, to explain the difference between individual and team MMR, and more specifically WHY team MMR matchmaking is bad.... \nSay bronze 1 has a team MMR of about 1000. With individual MMR matchmaking, both teams will have  about 200MMR individually. This means you are, generally, playing against someone with the same skill level as you. \n\nNow take that same 1000 total MMR and use the \"team\" matchmaking we have now with the same weight system; \nJoe bob jole dylan mcgreggor the bronze to masters streamer jungler has an adjusted 500 because hes on a hot streak.\nNancy average in the mid lane has 200. \nSloan the top laner has an adjusted 150 after a loss. \nPriscilla the marksman has an adjusted 75 because shes on a cold streak. \nAnd her support duo Beta o'korke has a 75 because hes on a cold streak.\n\nThe sheer difference in individual MMR  leads to VERY lopsided games. Lets say Priscilla is against a 500 adjusted MMR streamer Draven onetrick Chad o'brien and his average 200 MMR support Katherine wallflower; They dont really stand a chance in that lane, and will be stomped leading to their lane losing early and the enemy team snowballing hard. \n\n","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Sobx","date":"2019-02-16T21:29:36.499+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Sevje,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=opkWX7yT,comment-id=,timestamp=2019-02-16T12:55:00.221+0000)\n> Why do you have to play against plats/dia when you're gold?
