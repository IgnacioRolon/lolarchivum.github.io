I can say, without a doubt, that it was my foolishness that got me banned there, but the environment does not help the situation at all, in fact it makes it worse.\n\n\nYou see, the problem with Riot's tactic is that they're trying to stop people from being toxic when they [Riot] are consistently trying to piss them off. Imagine what would have happened if somebody fucked with you every time you interacted with him; you'd eventually get pissed off.\n\nI'd say the reason this game is toxic is 49% players 51% environment. It's simply impossible for Riot to stop people from tilting in this game when it's in such a state.\n\nIf you can stop yourself, then good on you, but many people can't and Riot doesn't really do much to help players reform.","replies":[{"poster":"WTBeGirl100EUhr","date":"2019-12-24T15:49:06.590+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is actually less about \"stopping myself\" and more about natural disposition.

Rarely see someone purposely INT ingame. Have noticed in ARAM ppl are generally way more chill and inclined to give tips. Call me optimistic or accuse me of having a perception bias, but I like to think overall it's LESS toxic and exclusive these days than when I last played a lot (2017 and before).\n\nIf someone does get toxic I rarely see anyone take the bait; infact oftentimes nowadays everyone might call the guy toxic but shut up, focus, and win anyway. Pulling the guy back to good play by not reacting to trollbait rage.\n\nJust my 2 cents","replies":[]},{"poster":"EATARI","date":"2019-12-23T23:00:51.441+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Almost none of my games get toxic.

As you say, the majority do not.\n\nIt is common enough that I incorporate perceived level of tilt into my strategies. Is the enemy Yas angry at his team and believes he has to carry them? Bait him. Is the Cait without faith in my team? Only engage when well warded.\n\nEnemies tilt in their style when losing very frequently but not quite more often than not. Especially after getting ganked or barely lost 1v1 due to a well timed flash or whatnot. Again I pay attention to their mood just based on how their play and control change...\n\nNot even counting chat.

Most of people ignore the bottom of the problems... . Like there is no mather someone can do 0 16 in gold ranked games... , but as long as it goes a negative score high plat , or diamond ,suddenly it starts to mather... , is so sad... , i reported hundreds of troll/griefers, never happened something until ,i haven't took to talk to Riot.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2019-12-23T18:09:10.702+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Toxic chat .. typically I see people doing report calling every 3-4 games.

In fact I remember one time a few years ago during a game of Hide &amp; Seek on The Crystal Scar (RIP Dominion, my favorite game mode). As Tristana I was hiding in the Boneyard bush when a teammate ran by trying to escape from the seekers. When one of them came by I tried ulting them into a wall to stun them, but I missed &amp; accidentally pushed them towards my ally, costing them a life. Despite my apologies and explanation they refused to listen or accept it, called me a troll and then proceeded to ruin the game themselves by trolling.\n\nSituations like that aside more often than not I have neutral or positive teammates where everyone's trying their best and don't make too big a deal out of others mistakes. Am I always positive? No, but when I do need to rage I do so at the screen and not in chat so I can vent without compromising my teams chances of success.","replies":[]}]}
