No-one&#039;s going to miss him for a patch, right?\r\n\r\nTHE NUMBERS ARE FOR EXAMPLE PURPOSE ONLY\r\n\r\nZ-Drive Resonance:\r\nSLOW: 30 / 40 / 50 / 60% (scaling with level) &gt;&gt;&gt;  30 + 0.05 AP% (60% slow at 600 AP)\r\nMovement Speed: 50 / 60 / 70 / 80% (scaling with level) &gt;&gt;&gt; 50 + 0.05 AP% (80% at 600 AP)\r\n\r\nTimewinder:\r\nSLOW: 32 / 39 / 46 / 53 / 60% (scaling with rank) &gt;&gt;&gt; 30 + 0.05 AP% (60% slow at 600 AP)\r\n\r\nParallel Convergence: \r\nSTUN: 2.25s &gt;&gt;&gt; 1.25 + 0.002 APs (1 second per 500 AP)\r\nThis is the bit I would be most iffy on. A stun duration scaling with AP seems REALLY difficult to balance, since with a high amount of AP this stun could become SUPER long (3s+). It&#039;s probably wiser to make it scale with rank or just reduce it flat-out (2.25s &gt;&gt;&gt; 1.75s)\r\n\r\nThe shield already scales 150% AP. Do we really need to buff that further to get Ekko to build AP? With 500 AP you have a 810 HP shield\r\n\r\nPhase Dive:\r\nNo changes. Range scaling with AP would be SUPER awkward.\r\n\r\nChronobreak: \r\nHonestly I personally feel that Chronobreak is pretty balanced on tank Ekko. The heal is pretty small (although the value with resistances is much higher) and AP Ekko can already pretty much fully heal itself. People complain about the ability itself, but lots of ults can be used as an escape - except those you get to choose where you end up. If you&#039;re playing tank Ekko and you&#039;re going deep, sometimes the ult isn&#039;t going to be somewhere safe for you to run to. It&#039;s not going to be somewhere safe in lane much of the time either. Honestly, I personally feel like much of the complaint about this ability is unfounded, and that the problems lie elsewhere in his kit. MAYBE adjust the numbers.","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2016-05-03T00:14:48.145+0000","up_votes":139,"down_votes":3,"body":"Hmm, can definitely see some promise there, the slow on the Q scaling with AP instead of rank in particular.

Let me explain: if he is ahead, his massive utility from his item (and consequently AP) advantage would make him insanely hard to shut down. However if he is behind, he will simply be useless. Remember that his base damage got nerfed hard too. \n\nSo tl;dr: if you are behind as AP Ekko, you have literally nothing to offer.\n\nSide note: His stun duration scaling with AP would be _super_ awkward, because he relies heavily on the stun in the early game where he has no AP.","replies":[{"poster":"Audiomancy","date":"2016-05-02T20:26:01.228+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":">if you are behind as AP Ekko, you have literally nothing to offer.\n\nYou could say the same with {{champion:7}}, {{champion:55}} or {{champion:84}}.","replies":[{"poster":"Troll for Trump","date":"2016-05-03T06:43:40.024+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"And in games it's either \"useless LB/kat/Akali\"\nor \"WTF BROKEN BURST LB/KAT/AKALI\".\n\nYou don't want to add another champ to that list.","replies":[{"poster":"Sqkerg","date":"2016-05-03T19:09:06.737+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thats like every assassin ever, except for Ekko...

Feast/Famine paradigms in League just don't work because of how oppressive they can be while ahead and how detrimental they are to your team while behind because of how kills and deaths work in the game. Every kill you get on an enemy grants you gold and experience as well as **time** while the opposing player is locked in the respawn screen. Any champion who gets really good at killing champions by killing in general results in consistently shutting champions out of the game for extending periods of time, making the one who is dead fall behind even further and the same is true when reversed.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"JusticePauldrons","date":"2016-05-02T17:17:33.807+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":4,"body":"Really the issue with Ekko is pretty obvious. He is meant as an assassin/skirmisher, but he has too much thrown into his kit that allows him to succeed in any role. \n\n**Lets go ahead and count em off.**\n\n* Ranged Slow\n* AoE Team stun/Slow\n* Dash\n* Increased move speed\n* An ultimate that allows him to escape death and deal damage.\n* 3 hit passive for strong damage\n\nSo out of all of these, what should an assassin not have that would allow him to succeed as a tank?\n\n~~Ranged Slow~~\n~~AoE Team stun/Slow~~\n\n\nNow I understand what you might be thinking \"Hey a slow isn't a big deal! The stun requires a setup!\" and while normally I would agree with you, these abilities once tied in with the rest of his kit allows him too much room to succeed in any role.\n\nThe utility provided by his dash and increased movespeed already provides a ton of sticking power on it's own. Once you couple those with his Q slow he can stick to his opponents a little too well, now throw in the aoe slow + stun effect of his W and you have a guy who can easily peel or lock down an enemy team.... like a tank would do. \n\nNow throw in his passive 3-hit. This allows him to be rewarded for staying alive in extended engagements while doing plenty of damage.\n\n**So how do we fix it? **\n\nGiven that the problem isn't really his mobility (assassins need that) we should target his ability to lock people down\n\n*  Reduce the slow from his Q to a much more manageable number, it is a large, relatively spammable aoe ability. Using this for damage would be one thing (it already provides a free 2 hits for his passive as well)  but preventing the enemy from moving late game is pretty annoying.\n\n* There is a few things we could do about Parallel Convergence. Removing the stun entirely for a stronger slow would make sense, or remove the slow portion so that just ending up in the AoE isn't a guarantee you will be stunned. Another problem solver could be simply reducing the range of the ability. If it was easier to see coming it wouldn't be so annoying to get hit by out of the blue. \n\n\n**\"I think he needs that lock down to succeed! What else could we change?\"**\n\nThe only other suggestion I can think of at this point would be to target his scaling to insure that Tank Ekko will not be a thing. \n\n* Reduce his health per level to properly coincide with just how much his kit provides. If tank Ekko is the problem, make it harder to go tank.\n\n* Dramatically lower the base damage from his passive, and increase the scaling it would get from AP to compensate. This insures that he will not deal a ton of free damage when building tank, but allows for his AP focused builds to remain largely the same.","replies":[{"poster":"ChaosThief","date":"2016-05-02T19:09:01.052+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"The stun is honestly what I would hit as well; it's either incredibly useful and basically turns a losing fight into an ace, or so obvious it's coming that you can never land it.\n\nWhat to change it into though is a good discussion.","replies":[{"poster":"rtbf22147970","date":"2016-05-02T20:48:23.917+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"It would be sick as a slow time where everything moves slower even projectiles...
