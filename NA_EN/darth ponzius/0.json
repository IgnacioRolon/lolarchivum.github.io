That is the only time it will happen, here an one reason why.\n\nImagine your playing ranked and your team sucks, you don't want a loss, so you AFK or a friend your playing with AFKs, then it become loss prevented and you just dodged a loss.\n\nAs stated by 12Tales, you will get points when someone on the opposing team AFKs, so it is fair(unless you are profoundly unlucky)\n\nIf you really want to avoid it, joining or creating a team would probably fix it\n\nAFK teammates will reduce as your rank goes up, you can push through it","replies":[]},{"poster":"12tales","date":"2014-09-12T11:03:27.427+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because you gain points when some dude on the other team afks.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CmereCupcake","date":"2014-09-12T10:58:15.993+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"An impossible problem to address because it is subject to abuse.

Cause i can't fail 3 promos in a row for someone going afk. And the 4th promo began with an other afk.\nIf someone goes afk have to be punished and pay with, for example,  50 lp or with a demotion in the case you have not enough lp. This is just an example to eliminate the problem of doing it on purpose to dodge a loss. It's fair to get demoted for 3 afk in match? Or fail 4 promo series like me right now? I'm mad cause an afk has no real punishment and all the team have to pay the prize of one single dick/dc for connection problem in the team.\np.s.
