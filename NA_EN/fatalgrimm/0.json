I already did a clean boot, disabled the windows recording software, and have done the recommended guidelines on RIOT's support page nothing has worked.\r\n\r\nGTX 970\r\n16 Gb ddr5 ram\r\n990fx sabertooth motherboard\r\nAMD FX-8350 black series","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-04-21T18:34:07.275+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for trying all these steps, and we'd like to help figure this out with you.
