I am just curious if this is a luck of the draw or if there is another reason for the extended queue time. Thank you for your time, i just thought 29 minutes was a bit excessive and wondering if this is the norm for other players as well.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-24T21:30:28.243+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I looked into your account and I was unable to see a [leaverbuster](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ) on your account.  If your timer was just for one game, then that would actually be a [queue dodge](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751844-Queue-Dodging) which places you in a lower priority queue for one game.  The LPQ can escalate up to 30 minutes depending on multiple dodges.  Hopefully, that helps clear things up!","replies":[]}]}
