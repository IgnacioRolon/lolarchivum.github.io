I tried running it as an administrator, restarting my PC and even reinstalling, but the same thing happened before the game even started to get updated. Could it be a bug caused by the new update?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-23T18:40:19.374+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is likely being caused by a recent issue with Discord.
