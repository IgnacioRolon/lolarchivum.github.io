ESPECIALLY YASUO. This is what I was talking about 5 years ago about them not knowing how to make games and to go back and graduate highschool before making a fucking game. Lee sin is still running about and people saying &quot;He requires skill&quot;. He doesnt and he hasnt since his conception. No wonder your game is dying. I come back to riot being stupid as shit again. Clock is ticking riot. You are already replaced by dota how much more fucked are you plan on getting before you learn to be good at life....or is it your goal to spiral into madness like many other Moba&#039;s. Well I will keep laughing at you. Now if you excuse me i have to play much better games but I will come back here to talk shit because you deserve it riot. Also I may bring friends to do it too. It comes to show that not everyone can appreciate their fanbase until it is too late and even Dunkey left","replies":[{"poster":"MoldyCheese1","date":"2017-06-25T04:03:31.593+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Building in progress (hehe C&C reference)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lopunny777","date":"2017-06-25T03:44:07.782+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also barrels with pirates really...so much is wrong with this game jesus christ","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lopunny777","date":"2017-06-20T05:24:36.726+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So desperate you are lying. Its fine I get it you want to live in a fantasy world. No its been dropping and even harder since overwatch came out....dont fucking lie to me lol. Yes they need nerfs or removal. Even when you win its not fun against them so it doesnt matter and yes yasuo needs a big nerf so noone plays him anymore","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-06-17T19:20:16.803+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dunkey still plays League, he just doesn't make videos for it anymore.\n\nAlso, League's monthly active users is rising and is the highest out of any online game, so I don't know that dying is the right term for what it is doing.\n\nAlso, I don't much of an issue in terms of balance for any of the characters you listed. They are all fairly easy to beat. I wouldn't say they need buffed, but they definitely don't need too much of a nerf.","replies":[]}]}
