I just recently got back into league a few weeks ago so I have no idea if this was a problem before so, but back in January it was not. My game freezes for sometimes 30-45seconds and sometimes for as little as 5seconds. I can alt tab to see other windows but cannot actually get off the league screen without force shutting down my whole computer. I can hear the regular game sounds that were happening at the current moment (for example if regular league background music is playing, it will continue to play on my frozen screen even if I die while frozen). This has caused me to lose multiple ranked games and I'm sure I've been reported a lot for \"giving up\" and griefing (I know this because my team definitely lets me know thats what theyre going to do when I get back). I have a Dell Inspiron 15 series (intel i5 and nvidia geforce GTX graphics card). I'm wondering if this is a disk space problem because normally if I run task manager while league is running its already at 80%, wondering if background processes might sometimes build up and freeze the game? It only happens once every 5ish games but you all know when you just randomly stand in lane for 15sec and even give over a free kill and give the enemy laner an exp/gold lead it really makes a lot of these games a lot harder than they need to be and I just feel bad for my teammates because I have no control over it...","replies":[{"poster":"Flat Is Hot","date":"2018-02-15T06:00:29.389+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i have the same problem and surprisingly i also have a dell inspiron 15 this could be happening for some of the dell laptop only","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-09T00:22:18.074+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This sounds like something is happening in the game files causing it to lock up completely, but only the game itself is locking up as opposed to your entire pc. With that being the case, let's first make sure that all of the game files and working properly by running a repair through the client options. Let me know if that doesn't seem to do much good though!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Elimist","date":"2017-07-08T20:43:24.571+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is/was happening to me as well.","replies":[]},{"poster":"joe rogan dmt420","date":"2017-07-08T18:30:08.304+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can post the specs to my laptop as well if needed, but i've seen similar threads about it possibly being something related to windows 10","replies":[]}]}
