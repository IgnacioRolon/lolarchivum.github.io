Tankyness: since Ryze has been nerfed to be reliant on his passive to provide him with a window to deal damage, you'll want to deal as much damage as you can. Since your sustained damage is really low after your passive times out the tankyness is worth nothing apart from maybe giving your other carries a bit more time to deal damage. It wont keep you alive for long enough to get your passive again.\n\n2. CDR: Ryze's Kit gives him enough CDR, so wasted money here.\n\n3. Mana: Probably the only beneficial stat together with the Spirit Visage passive, which can also still be of use for Ryze, but since the manascalings generally got nerfed and his AP ratios got buffed, building AP seems a lot more beneficial as an offensive stat for Ryze.\n\nThese are probably also the reasons for the pros not building tanky on Ryze and the winrate of Frozen Heart and Spirit Visage being average while the winrates of AP items like Luden's Echo and Rabadon's are going through the roof.","replies":[]},{"poster":"NVDax","date":"2015-06-07T04:19:35.611+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"This rework was such a bust.","replies":[{"poster":"The Whamboozler","date":"2015-06-08T17:50:26.437+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nearly ALL of the reworks have been busts.
