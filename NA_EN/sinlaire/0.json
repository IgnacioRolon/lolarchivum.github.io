Vi's been around for years and many people have wanted and suggested a Hell Boy themed skin for her as well. i'm sure there are one or two you could easily find on deviant art right now.\n\nSo how could Riot not slip in the little Joke of using her name for a reference to the symbol of the beast when it's just her named written down her leg 3 times?\n\nShe's a demon in this skin, a beast reference is almost a given, and almost no attraction is drawn to it due to her still having her iconic tattoo under her eye and her name on her back as well.\n\nI find it to be a clever little mini easter egg and nothing more. i'm wasn't naive enough to think all would like it, but credit must be given for sly reference.","replies":[{"poster":"TwinkiePro","date":"2015-10-09T05:52:32.418+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"I didn't say that the skin wasn't well done nor the easter egg of \"Vi Vi Vi\" not clever, because it is. The thing is, it is actually offensive to a large group of people. Cigarettes aren't offensive, there is really nothing to be offended about, but referencing the beast on a skin is practically anti-christian. I'm not going to call for the skin to be pulled, I'm simply going to ignore and not support it, like a normal person should should something irk them.","replies":[{"poster":"Faith Breaker","date":"2015-10-09T11:51:28.729+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Satan is an unremovable part of Christianity, so including this is more of a nod to and acknowledge of Cristianity and isn't not Anti Christian.

And you basically stated what i said, that it's anti christian. Grammar nazi aside, Whether its a nod or not, it is not in a direction any Christian would see fitting.
