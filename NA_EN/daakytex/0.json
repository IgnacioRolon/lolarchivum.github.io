Its awful. Its so much worse than the Legacy one... What the hell were they thinking when they decided to do it like that??\nI know its beta and some features might still be coming but its lacking so many classic and basic features, like us being able to watch or winrates in every champion we played in ranked and not just our Top 4 or 5.\nWhat dissapoints me the most is that when you go to your recently played folder on the friends list you cant even right click to block them... you have to send a friend request first if you forgot to block him on the ENd game lobby...\nIts so so so bad. \nI dont mind the esthetics of it. I actually quite like it. But everything else is just awful compared to the old one...\nWhy did they bother with making a new client if they just make a shitty one?=??!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Terrio oOoOoO","date":"2016-11-22T17:01:50.105+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im having the same issue, the new update is stuck at 99%!
