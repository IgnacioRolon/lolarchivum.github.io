However if I try to use an ability by pressing q. Nothing happens. (I've tried quick cast and normal cast)\n\nI've tried reconnecting, using another keyboard, restoring default settings, and using different USB ports but none have permanently worked. After switching to a different keyboard it was fine for one game, then it didn't work for the second. Same thing for switching USB ports. Both keyboards work perfectly otherwise.\n\nI did spam F once and after about 10 presses it cast. So I'm very confused.\n\nEDIT: Also one of the keyboards has worked excellently for League of Legends for 3 years and still works perfectly well for playing other games. However it has the same issue.\n\nMy thoughts on the problem: The other keyboard is pretty new and these last couple of games have been my first time using it with League of Legends. Perhaps it's done something and that something is what's making the old keyboard have the same issue?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-02-03T23:53:30.609+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like your config may have become corrupt somehow.

Some games it does it other games it doesn't.
