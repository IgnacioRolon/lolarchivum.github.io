This is not directed at you per se as it is not your fault at all, but Yorick is the worst handled moba character since the Gambler.  He is permabanned from the free week rotation, he is constantly the culprit behind spaghetti code breaking the game (unlimited deaths in a game, dropping games every other patch, etc.), no skins released, perma \"on the remake to do list.\"\nLets be completely frank here, why has he not been #1 on the redo list?  Why has Gangplank now received 2 visual updates while Yorick, who is not in a sorry visual state in my opinion, will not get a skin because he is \"on the VU list?\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"Trollas","date":"2015-07-18T07:46:55.594+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Soo i'm still waiting For udyr vu anything maybe? or he is at Trash can ? no plans nothing? please?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"TotalJerk","date":"2015-07-17T01:03:24.888+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"You've just implied that Fiora is getting a visual update in addition to a gameplay one.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-07-17T01:08:48.208+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not quite. :] \n\n> This can go for the model, skills, or sounds. \n\nIf skills change (for example, a gameplay change), we'd need to concept new particles for the skin we'd already created.
