My ping kept on hitting in the 800s for whatever reason and it was in 2 games that kept doing this. In the second game about 5 minutes ago, I told my to hang in there and let me restart my computer. One teammate decided to give up and told the opponent to push when I came back and I was reported unfairly because of something that was completely out of my control. I should not be placed in low queue because of the ping going up so high and I am not sure if the servers are stable. Please take me out of low queue so I am able to play properly and to also tell me if the servers are doing good. I made sure everything is fine on my end but I find this very discouraging.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-02T22:47:07.190+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I looked into our logs and was unable to find any record of service issues on NA within the last 24 hours. Unfortunately, I cannot remove your LPQ. Regardless of intent, a disconnection negatively impacts your team. This is a key reason why the system treats all disconnections equally and why penalties cannot be modified in any way.\n\nHigh latency (ping) is sometimes caused by poor ISP routing to the server, but we'll first need to ensure your local network settings are good. Therefore, as a first step, I recommend working through our [connection guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) in its entirety.\n\nLet me know if those steps caused any change.","replies":[{"poster":"SummonerBWM","date":"2016-12-28T00:58:11.149+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I took a break from this game for a few months since I was in college and also upset I cannot be taken out of LPQ. I tried playing the game again and the game did the same thing, except it disconnected during the leading screen into the match. I tried to log back in but once I did, the game was over and it pushed me lower into the LPQ, now having me to wait another 20 minutes (I find it unfair still because not only the team is negatively impacted, but it also impacts me as well and I will have to suffer for something out of my reach. THe LPQ should be able to be changed manually by those in charge so players who actually disconnected will not end up quitting the game altogether. It is not enjoyable ).  I downloaded the Hextech Repair Tool and had it to do some tests. It told me to run the game as an administrator because a few things didn't work for some reason regardless. I'll do that and will come back here to let you know what happened.","replies":[]}]}]}
