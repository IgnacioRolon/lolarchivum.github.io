I remember a time when I had zero problems playing League of Legends. We have been plagued by connectivity issues and server stability issues for months. It seems to get better, then get worse again but I believe whole heatedly that Riot has stopped caring about its community when it comes to these issues. People have been complaining about constant disconnects, micro-stutter lag, connectivity issues, and other things over the past few months. I have experienced some, but not all of these problems. I have uninstalled, deleted, re installed the game. I constantly monitor my own internet connection to make sure its not on my end. I run diagnostics to see if my latency is spiking, and other troubleshooting steps to figure out of its on my end. I have even gone to the point of re-installing windows and proper driver updates. You can not put the blame on anyone anymore, I demand a public statement as to why, with all the millions of dollars this company is worth that you can not resolve simple issues like these. Lack of employees, lack of employee knowledge, hardware issues, connection provider issues, all of that can be dealt with over time. You have had MORE time than necessary during the obvious growing of these issues. I remember playing with 10+ friends, that I knew from outside of league of legends and NONE of them play anymore except me. On a larger scale, i'm pretty sure you will lose more of your player-base if this behavior is not resolved. You're breaking peoples hearts in the process, some people cant wait for a day off from work to play this game and then subjected to this type of nonsense.\n\nPeople will say \"1000 RP\" like you have done in the past. You can have it, spend the money on fixing your internal company issues, and address the public by saying you are sorry.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ImWaterlemonCat","date":"2014-12-06T12:44:36.644+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I pass the \"logging screen\" but get disconnect after one game\nbetter than last week, lol\nI just don't want to be banned bc of being afk\np/s: the lag is real","replies":[]},{"poster":"BugWaifusBest","date":"2014-12-06T09:26:38.419+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"League has been out for me since the huge drop around 2-3am EST Thursday.
