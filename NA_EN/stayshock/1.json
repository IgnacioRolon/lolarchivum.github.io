I noticed people played him for the 1st 2 months but now I don&#039;t see the character being used at all. I&#039;ve heard others complain about how bored they were using the character though he was so effective in the game. Free to play came around and I tried him......needless to say....bored to tears. \n\nMay suggest for fun factor a slight change:\n\nPassive: Comet of Legend- takes effect after moving in the same direction for 4 sec.\n\n**Q: Formations of the Stars-   3 formations**\nToggle by pressing Q that changes the release effect of E \n\nCooldown: 5 sec\n1. **Center of the Universe**: Circular motion around epicenter\n2. **Triangular**: Stationary in a triangle formation of front: left, right and 1 behind the dragon\n3. **Firestorm**: 3 stars iin front of dragon spins around the epicenter......  a 4th star \n\nW: Voice of Light \n\n**E: Star Fire!!!**\nCooldown: 2.5 sec to recreate each star once the ability has been fully used.\n\n1. Center of the Universe &gt; **Celestial Expansion **   (High-Mid Damage)\n2. Triangular &gt; **Comet Descend**: \"automatically\" shoot in rapid succession the stars into the sky.  2 seconds later the stars descend  exploding into radius blasts releasing area of effect hits  (Low-damage)\n3. Firestorm &gt; **Fireballs**: shoots stars forward a short range one at a time with each button press (Mid-damage)\n\nR: Starsurge\n\n\nI DONT WANT THE KIT TO CHANGE BUT GIVE MORE OPTIONS WITH THE STAR FORMATION","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-10-22T19:58:14.936+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Aurelion is perfectly fine.

I'm saying keep the powers the same but just add an option with the star formation.\nObviously you love the character so your passionate...... I played him and I know others that have too.

There is just no reason to do it.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"stayshock","date":"2016-10-24T16:43:18.407+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i think Jinx is a fun character!!!

Flash and put tibbers on someone and they die, not fun at all?
