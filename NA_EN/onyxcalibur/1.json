I think Riot HQ has some sort of tracker, otherwise how else would they know who to gift the icons to? If any Rioters/players have access to that info/know a way for us to see progress or can straight up just tell me my progress, it would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-07-27T22:24:43.446+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I looked into this for you, but it doesn't look like you have Kayn unlocked.  You'll need to have him unlocked to get missions specific to that.
