I was so ready for him to be my favorite champion for the rest of time.\n\nWhen he came out, despite all of the bugs, he was clearly out of balance because he didn't meet the \"long-term, sustained damage\" that his feel as a commander of an army begged for. And then his rebalances pushed him further into burst mage territory. Funny enough, this happened partly because a \"bug\" was sending his soldiers further out with his Q than was initially intended.\n\nOther commentators are absolutely right: he's a squishy champ. Furthermore, I don't think that should change. He's a field commander, his soldiers do the fighting for him, so it makes sense that he's easily defeated when confronted directly. If you keep a short leash on his soldiers and reduce his damage that just means his win rate is going to plummet to unhealthy levels. However, if you reduce his power and increase his range to the initial \"bugged\" level, not only would it bring him back to being a sort of Not-Tank Tank, but even introduce some counterplay.\n\nEssentially, having that zone of control keeps people away from him (or at least makes them reluctant to come too close) in a way similar to Heimerdinger's zone of safety created by his turrets. This could be frustrating if it stood alone, since unlike 'dinger, Azir's soldiers can't be targeted. However, if his Q's cooldown were tuned correctly (via experimentation internally and on PBE), you could make it a meaningful choice. Either he gambles on sending the soldiers forward to do some damage and stun the enemy for his jungler, leaving himself open to jumpy champs who can get past his soldiers or the enemy jungler for ganks. Or, he can keep his Q around for escapes.\n\nI'll be back later to elaborate further or continue the discussion, but I've got to get to work now.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Declined","date":"2015-01-26T12:08:07.251+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you believe burst is a problem, may I ask?\n\n* Do you believe it is a problem when it is long range, and can be hard to counter, beyond mobility, with no room to retaliate.\n* Are you talking about close range, where he also has his shield, giving him a chance to negate some of the damage?\n\nIf the first is the problem, it might be a safe solution to create an extra passive to the soldiers with a thematic name such as \"Eroded Command\" where the damage is decreased by a percentage depending on the proximity to Azir, and the further away he is the less damage they deal.\n\nJust a silly suggestion, but I would like to know why this might, or might not work.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sinspunch","date":"2015-01-26T02:04:38.634+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=FHIZw2Gv,comment-id=000100030000,timestamp=2015-01-26T01:52:53.557+0000)\n>\n> Yeah, burst's one of the other things we've been looking at, particularly now that people have go pretty good at chaining his spells/attacks together quickly.\n\nBecause that's what happens when you play a champion?

In other words your early game would be weak and then late game you would explode into this hyper carry.\n\nI just don't understand what the intention was with Azir.

Range is one of the possible nerf points (it was while looking at his ranges we realized the indicator was off).\n\nThanks for the clarification.\nI might have come off a bit harsh in my original post. Some of the changes are great. Fizz for example is my favorite. You guys kept his identity at avoiding skills with his E (also his waveclear), but reduced the frustrating parts of his early kill potential/zoning power, missing his shark (which is quite slow) and then killing you anyways (I outplayed him! He killed me!), and his dot killing you from 1/3 hp (often wasting a potion/flash--insult on top of injury). Catching a champion with such a slippery skill actually made me feel good. Nerfing it would be like nerfing yasuo's windwall or master yi's alpha invulnerability, greatly reducing the viability of a squishy melee damage dealer.\nWhich btw, might be a huge problem with the new katarina. Katarina relied on not dying by killing everyone before they can react. While that was not the healthiest of game design, assuming that the change is effective at stopping the no counterplay pentakills, the new katarina then has no way of preventing instant death when she jumps in at melee range. 30% damage reduction on shunpo is nothing. Master Yi has 70% damage reduction (and heal) on his meditate (plus the alpha strike to dodge skills). The cooldown difference is not that important for a melee carry. The difference between 30% and 70% is a lot of difference in effective hp. I think with the way she is currently, she is more likely to be built a bruiser than pure damage. As a bruiser she would be outclassed, and without cc, would be ineffective at locking down carries.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Guy Fox Teemo","date":"2015-01-26T03:05:05.554+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=FHIZw2Gv,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-01-25T08:15:08.372+0000)\n>\n> This is an indicator change only, the spell's actual range isn't increasing.\n> \n> We're considering Azir nerfs for 5.3, he's stronger in some situations than he should be.
