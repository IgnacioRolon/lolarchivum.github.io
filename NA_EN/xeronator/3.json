Doesn't matter if you have something witty, if you wanna call out the Ornn, you mute and you don't. Regardless of if they were bad or toxic, you egged it on, becoming toxic in your own right. Common sense dictates if you're talking to a premade, you just don't do it since they outnumber you.  Yes, it hella sucks, and I have issues with it, but it really ain't worth losing your account (and money) over people in a stupid game.  I would have reported you myself. Being toxic doesn't just mean the instant ban phrases. If you make a game unenjoyable, or harder for your team in any way, you are considered toxic. If, as a keyboard warrior, you help your team lose by continually typing and they continually type to respond to you instead of playing the game, you're considered toxic. It's usually just best to mute and report. They'll eventually get theirs, and you get to keep playing without tilting worse.
