I put all of my code in a do-loop but for some reason, the output that is bolded will only appear whenever I type in the correct numbers.\n\nI'm trying to make that specific part of the code show regardless of the attempts tried.\n\nThat's all I needed help fixing.\n\n*AND YES THE CODE COMPILES AND THE LOOP WORKS*","replies":[]}
