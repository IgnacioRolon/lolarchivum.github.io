And that's with having the game listed as defeat not leaver/remake/etc. \nSince any negative restrictions on my account I've gotten honored, only up to level 4, but i don't play as much as i would like these days. being honorable, doing what you're supposed to, doesn't benefit you as far as their punishment systems go. I had one account get 14 day ban from a days worth of troll players in flex reporting w/ their premades. \nChat restriction bans are even more silly, as generally it only accounts for chat, and not how heavily you may have been trolled in the game. And being on the naughty list from chat bans starts the train for suspensions. Again, most of which was because of what you typed, and not what happened during the game play experience that prompted anything to begin with. \nAcross my many accounts over the years, it feels more like Riots attempts to put out the fire has only caused the flames to engulf the community into a toxic pit.The system is horrifically flawed in many ways that has come to ruin more players experience than help. So many people have found ways to troll others, and they are now using Riots own system against them. Hard to believe how far off the community has gone, and how silly the response from Riot has become. Anywho, guess i'll hop on another alt.
