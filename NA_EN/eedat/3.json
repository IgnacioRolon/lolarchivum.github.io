If you aren&#039;t familiar with why or how to &quot;counter&quot; the other champion, it doesn&#039;t really work. You&#039;ll just end up feeding anyway because you have no idea how to play the champion\r\n\r\nC) Being shoveled into picking a champion that you don&#039;t like playing makes the game not fun. Why would people play a game that isnt fun? It is a game after all. \r\n\r\nWith that being said, if you do enjoy and know how to play a champion and know that champion does well against the enemy, that is acceptable. Just getting tired of all these BS comments and threads &quot;just pick X champion and you beat Y champion&quot;. Well what if I dont like playing X champion? What if I don&#039;t play X champion for a reason? What if I have no experience playing X champion? What if playing X champion isnt even an option?\r\n\r\n#**Counterpick =/= Counterplay**","replies":[{"poster":"Astôlfo","date":"2016-08-25T00:30:24.338+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":3,"body":"People who say counterpicking is counterplay aren't entirely wrong. It still does count as counterplay. It's just not reliable counterplay and thus not the only factor one should rely on to check for balance.\n\nBut people who say that there's only counterpicking and no other counterplay to a champion are always dead wrong. There is no champion in the game whose counterplay is solely limited to matchups.\n\nEDIT: oh look random downvotes for no reason, cute.","replies":[]},{"poster":"EndlessSorcerer","date":"2016-08-25T01:09:06.694+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Counterpicks are used to take advantage of weaknesses in the champion's kit or playstyle.\n\nHowever, you can use those weaknesses as any champion.

And when you do pick after your oppenent, you can counterpick him. Not sure where you are going with this because on the other side oppenents can still counterpick you and there can still be a counterpick. Therefore, the probability of counterpicking on both sides can be quite high.\n\nB) Sometimes this happens, sometimes it doesn't. Just because I've never played that champion before doesn't mean I don't know how to play him. You get experience from simply playing champions and therefore get a feel for the game.\n\nC) It's your choice to pick that champion. If you want to play a champion you don't like in order to beat someone, It's your choice. People have other reasons to do this, such as gain elo. They don't _have_ to have fun.\n\nWith that said, counterpicking can be a form of counterplay, but not always. However, I'm getting the feeling that there is so much BS out there about how you shouldn't play a champion first time in ranked or something. I do that all the time and it usually doesn't end up that badly.","replies":[]}]}
