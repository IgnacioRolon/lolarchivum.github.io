It's wildly inefficient until someone on the enemy team has the CDR or mana to regularly use healing spells, or until the ADC has to fight the mid/top that has large sustain (like Vlad or Swain). When you also consider that almost nobody buys BoRK or Death's Dance as an ADC, and few ADCs buy BT until the last item, it's even worse.
