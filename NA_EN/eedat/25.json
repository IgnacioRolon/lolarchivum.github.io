People dont seem to understand this. The Legacy client ***did not support the new 10 ban system***. Now that it&#039;s finally being retired across all servers, they can ***just now*** implement it. Calm down. They weren&#039;t just holding back on us for no reason. \n\nSecond, [Riot has already said the Item set creator will be back very soon](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/features/legacy-client-now-retired)\n\n> FIRST, we&#039;ve finally got a date for the return of the Item Set Creator Tool. We&#039;re now aiming to bring the feature (which lets you edit item sets from the client without using a third party tool) to the PBE with patch 7.10. Barring any problems, it will then come to live servers soon after. We&#039;ll update you in the patch notes if anything happens to delay the tool&#039;s release further. Check the FAQ below for more details.\n\n***This was announced two weeks ago***\n\nEveryone needs to chill out","replies":[{"poster":"Jbels","date":"2017-05-05T14:13:21.034+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":9,"body":"I understand the Legacy client was limited, but it's frustrating that I went from getting a solid 50 to 55 FPS consistently to being thrown down to 24-30 FPS for the majority of the game (IE; Whenever I'm NOT in base). \n\nThis new client is a good step forward, but in other aspects it is a large step backwards.
