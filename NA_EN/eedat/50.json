This is especially true when previously (and riot mentioned bringing it back) people's games were put on show with or without permission.  Furthermore you can already spectate any friend who is currently in game.\n\nI was simply wondering why people would exclusively get to deny other's the ability to download their replays.\n\nAlso I was questioning how asking other's for their replay would work if there were multiple friends in that game.  It seems very round about and rude to go through asking everyone just because one person denied.  It could also lead to people friending other people who were in the game just to get at the replay.\n\nOverall there seems to be a number of needless complications when it comes to asking for permission (Which include having to wait for that person to come online again) when everything but the replay is already available for everyone to see.","replies":[{"poster":"Kairoptra","date":"2017-05-29T00:52:12.424+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What I'm saying is that if they already have it, why would they need to share it?

Person A, B and C.  They are all friends.  Person B and C played a game together.  Person A wants the replay of said game.\n\nIf person A has to ask permission does the request go to B, C, or both?  If it just goes to one of them, say person B, then what stops person A from going to person C and getting the replay from them?  What if I request the video from both of them because I don't know who will be on again first, if they both accept then do I get 2 notifications?  Does the second person get a notification that the game was already shared?\n\nIf neither B nor C choose to share the game with person A then what is to stop person A from going behind their backs and sending person D, who was also in the game, a friend request request purely to try and get the replay from them?\n\nOverall it can cause a lot of conflict and raises the issue of telling people that they can choose to not share games, but not actually letting them lock away that video because any one of the other 9 people can still freely share it.\n\nThat is why I am against giving people the option, because it could lead to bad habits and pointless friend requests while also giving imaginary power.  Instead people should be able to download replay's of the games on anyone's account with or without permission, since they could have spectated them anyways.\n\nPretending to give people a decision is pretty silly when the decision has to be agreed upon by all 10 people, and there are 3rd party programs that will automatically record people's games for them anyways, which just breaks a permission system even further.","replies":[{"poster":"Kairoptra","date":"2017-05-29T17:27:09.723+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oooooohh I get what you're saying now. I think that a system for requesting would be more of a formality than anything; I think that people would prefer that it at least felt like a choice. As for \"going behind their backs\", I think the general rule would be that it's their game, too, they should have the freedom to do with it what the want. Think of it this way: which is sillier? Someone who worked on a movie being able to give a copy to anyone they like, or having to get the consent of everyone who worked on it (cast, crew, etc.) and THEN giving it freely? It's the same basic principle for replay, or at least I think it would be. Clearly, there was some miscommunication along the way; I don't think that all ten people should have to agree upon sharing the replay, but people should at least feel like it's private in that they have to give their consent to share the copy that they own. That way, they would know that they are doing everything in their power to keep that game private, if they feel the need to keep it so. As for multiple notifications, maybe so; I would think that the computer would see them as individual files, but I might be wrong on that account.","replies":[{"poster":"Fondling Gems","date":"2017-05-29T20:57:14.279+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think comparing it to a movie is a little bit off though, rather than it being a general movie it is a freely shared production.  Anyone could come in and watch/record while it was filming.  This makes it feel a bit weird if after it is finished you have to ask for permission to view it, but anyone who worked on it, or just showed up while other people were working on it and recorded it can freely share it with everyone.\n\nSuddenly it being your movie (or game as the case may be) doesn't matter, instead all that matters is if someone was watching it happen.\n\nI just have a bit of trouble understanding why I can view any game on my friends list live but I can't view them after they finish.  If I download their replay later it isn't as though they would need to get a notification about it so they would only know if I brought it up.  If that really offends them for some reason they could just ask me to stop, or worst case just unfriend me so I can't watch any of their games.\n\nI just don't understand fighting for replay permissions when you can already watch them live anyways.","replies":[{"poster":"Kairoptra","date":"2017-05-29T21:24:42.944+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Like I've said, people like privacy, or at least the idea of it. We know very well, now more than ever, that our lives are not private. Surveillance cameras keep us in check, making sure we do no wrong while never giving us a second's privacy. Stores like Target track the purchases of their customers and are able send them coupons based on them; very unnerving, though convenient. It's the same basic principle here; people want to feel safe and ignore the fact that they can be seen. People are optimistic that way; we see cameras as a way of keeping us safe rather than the \"all-seeing-eye,\" and we see the stores' surveillance as a thoughtful and a good business move, rather than \"cold and calculating\". In the same way, people would see needing permission as them being secure with their footage, rather than futile if they can be viewed in-game.\nAlso, I have to admit you're right; the movie analogy is a tad askew. How's this one: Say a group of students are doing homework together after school. The homework was meant to be independent, i. e. it's not something they **have** to work on together. Once they complete it, should each one have the right to turn in their own finished work, in spite of any different answers? Or should they have to go through the grueling process of making sure they all have the same answer before turning it in? Obviously, the first one is far easier, so I think that clears up our misunderstanding of having to get all 10 people's permission; we're saying the same thing in that regard.","replies":[{"poster":"Fondling Gems","date":"2017-05-29T21:29:32.281+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fair enough, it just seems very off strange to me.
