Something important that you have to understand about illaoi, her laning is only strong if you let her take over. Up close, she has no cc, no escapes, no peel, nothing to defend herself, besides her somewhat high base stats. Don't be a pussy, dodge her e and q, and go in. You will be able to outtrade her with the overwhelming majority of the toplane roster. Darius is completely different from that, and comparing the two is an absolutely useless practice. \nThis whole post is a mess:\nIllaoi doesn't autowin against meelees, she autowins against stupid people.\nIllaoi is pretty fucking bad against ranged champs, that is true. I suppose if you have a very high skillshot accuracy, you can get by.\nDarius is not bad against ranged champs by any means. The only ranged champs that darius can't beat all the time is quinn, because of her autopeel button, and urgot, who can actually just straight up fight darius in some situations, but he's in a different class anyways. If you get on top of a ranged champ, which is not as hard as it sounds, you are going to kill them. Always. The pure stat advantage you have is more than enough to just walk up and destroy a ranged champ. Of course, there are smaller nuances that you have to master, like keeping track of defensive/kiting abilities cooldowns, and just having a feel for a good engage opportunity, but the theory that darius is useless against ranged champions is a gigantic misconception. Some of the easier matchups are ranged champions themselves, like Teemo or Vayne.\nThe last point is correct abut illaoi, but terribly wrong about Darius. Darius has multiple (!) tools to get on top of the backline with relative ease. Phase rush, black cleaver movespeed, righteous glory, dead man's plate, flash and generally not being a dumbass who walks into knockbacks are all tools that make it ridiculously easy for you to get 5 stacks, get on the backline, and absolutely destroy them with your 1.2k true damage execution.","replies":[]},{"poster":"hoganftw","date":"2018-01-16T22:53:41.146+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My problem is that her E have the dumbest hitbox in the game.
