Current LW is 35% and with the Masteries, you get up to 39% because it's multiplicative. ArP is becoming ADDITIVE and you can get 7% from Masteries, so you get 47% with LW and masteries, so you're getting an 8% boost in armor. An extra 8 per 100 armor on Thresh. \n\nI'm not going to say it's a HUGE change or that it'll affect his pick rate, but eh. Yasuo gets to turn him into swiss cheese, but he already does that to anyone. lol.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Archon X","date":"2015-11-05T00:38:20.160+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"Thresh is already trash","replies":[{"poster":"OperationDEEZ1","date":"2015-11-05T01:40:30.160+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wish.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Marthian","date":"2015-11-05T01:25:27.228+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Something to note:\n\nLast Whisper now costs 1300g (Pickaxe+425g), gives 25 AD, and gives 30% bonus penetration.\nLast Whisper now has two upgrade options:\nOne for dealing with tanks: Giving extra % phys damage against champions with more health than you.\nThe other for dealing with healers, applying Grievous Wounds on hit for 5 seconds (GW reduces healing by 40% now)\n\nIn either case: Both cost 2700g each (includes component costs), give 40 AD, and 40% Bonus Armor Penetration.\n---\nIn other words: If they just have Last Whisper, Thresh's defense was straight buffed.\n\nIf they finished one of the two upgrades, it's a buff if Thresh's bonus armor is less than 112, and a nerf if it's greater. (Still, Thresh is fairly problematic in that he does too many things and doesn't really pay much for it.)\n\nThat said, it's a fairly minor nerf.

It's a unique passive. (Made another post in the thread if you are curious where it evens out.

I think that is the main issue.\n\nHis competition is becoming more durable in comparison to him.","replies":[]}]}
