Its fitting for those who wish to play ranked, but it sucks the fun out of casual players. Where's the option to have everyone play mid just for the heck of it? Where's the option to place two top with two bot (no jungle)? This lack of freedom to even play with something like a Sandbox is depressing. Riot *says* they are working on a Sandbox but I don't want to wait until next year to see it. Wasn't it Warcraft's Sandbox that helped shape DoTA (and then DoTA 2 and League of Legends.... and games that follow)? I don't see what's so bad about it.\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n**TL;DR** This is about another game called VainGlory. Please read if you feel like it.\n\nOn the plus side, VainGlory is so alluring. So far, they don't release new Heroes every month, they do it every two months at best. They have good match making (not perfect). Their chests system is far better, just asking for you to do a task and you get a reward. You even get a better chest for every level up, up to 30 chests (each growing in quantity per every few level ups). Another chest system (called seasonal chests) is coming soon that just asks you to win a few matches to make the 8 hourly chest reward to give better rewards. And these chests give out everything, from cards and essence that help to get you skins, to SEMC's version of IP (which is Glory), to SEMC's version of RP (which is ICE), and even boosts to help you gain more Glory or Experience. They even have a Ranked system that if you solo, you can Rank up to get a trophy and keep it after each season is over or go duo (or trio) with friends in a guild to gain bonus Glory or even ICE after each season is over (not giving it out evenly, it gives it out based on how much you contribute to the team). Its ever growing, very rewarding, and seems to do what League lacks... it knows how to balance. Making sure every Hero is not too strong, and that each Hero can play its part. Its also very easy when there are only 24 Heroes (and one on the way sometime in July).\n\nI haven't got to get into OverWatch, yet. I hear its great. Sadly, my Mac can't run the game, and I wouldn't want it to anyway. My Mac sadly didn't have to power to play League as much as I did and I ruined its battery and its Hard drive (having to get a new one). Lesson learned, never over use your laptop (even if it is a AlienWare).","replies":[{"poster":"bluegolisano","date":"2016-06-15T01:30:46.773+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"PC advise; First, Apple can burn in hell.

Note that some PCs are ridiculously beefy at defaults as well, such as Asus (although, the one I had wound up forcing me to buy a separate charger and battery because its default plug disconnected internally).\n\nOn the flip-side, Blizzard's Overwatch is an insanely fast-paced FPS, and simply murdered the shit out of Halo 5 Guardians. Not to mention, it is SIMILAR to League of Legends, as it's a Hero-based game. The main differences is that there are no items to buy (other than cosmetics that are all free anyways...) and you can change hero mid-match if you're inside the spawnpoint. Of all this? The same company made a decent MOBA as well. I played a bit of Heroes, and it's okay _I guess,_ considering the fact that my game malfunctioned and its lobby system didn't work on reinstall either.\n\nDream system; Games from Blizzard with a launcher-quality from League of Legends or Valve.

I'd much prefer three minute queues over a thirty second one if the game was actually fair. Games are usually over by the fifteen minute mark when  there is a higher tier player on one team unless someone disconnects or something.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kyunsei","date":"2016-06-14T11:33:26.424+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I saw lot of post being rude to Macromite, well he was rough so it's okay.\n\nWhat he wanted to say is that there's 3 things actually, 2 who's closely correlated to queue time and with who you'll be matched with and one who have nearly nothing to do with it.\n\nso let me list the three things :\n\n**1.** Being able to be matched with premades of 1,2,3,4 or 5 and to fill gap to make a team of 5 commonly what I'll call **Dynamic queue**\n\n**2.** Being able to select primary and secondary role before being matched with the DQ (point1) I'll call that **Role selections.**\n\n**3. New champion select**, which enable you to show what champion you would like to play, the role the game purpose you trough your pre-selected (should show both role), the new ban mechanism and a brand new design.\n\nQueue time are directly affected by role selections, and the people you'll be matched with too (you can't be five mid or five top) which means not only premade affect who you'll be queued with.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Noxid Lyrrad","date":"2016-06-14T08:00:44.110+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"I would say that picking two roles is definitely not part of champ select for the simple fact that you don't pick a champion at that time. There's picking your roles + DyQ -> champ select. Yes, champ select and DyQ are not the same, but what you described there occurs along with the DyQ phase.","replies":[{"poster":"6KEMBE4ORBA","date":"2016-06-14T12:49:08.882+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"There are 2 working systems currently which obviously can be separated because Riot already did it earlier in this season.\n\n- the ability to que with multiple ppl.\n\n- new champ select with pre-defined roles. You pre-determine 2 roles before you go in champ select only cause the new CHAMP SELECT itself is designed and requires these pre-determined roles.** So the pre-determined roles component is actually part of the NEW CHAMP SELECT.**\n\nYou might as well call the first one \"A\" and the second one \"B\".  Your choice, but I think common sense + logic works better.","replies":[]}]}]}
