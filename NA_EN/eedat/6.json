Before these builds came along he was fine back in early S6.\n\nRiot wants to keep short range, so there's not really a way to balance him besides tweaking his damage, and we all know how that tends to turn out. {{champion:104}} {{champion:429}}\n\nHonestly, if they gave him a little of his range back, reverted the Q damage changes, and forced him to build crit he wouldn't be nearly as much of a problem.
