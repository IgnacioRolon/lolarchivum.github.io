I don&#039;t exactly understand why old player have to pay so much for this new rune system thats being handed out for free to everyone regardless.\n\nSeems to me that older players are pretty pissed while newer players who dont have much invested in runes or are getting 100% refunds are telling us that its not a problem. Hmmm weird how that works. When something doesnt affect someone directly it suddenly becomes &quot;get over it&quot; or &quot;entitlement&quot;. \n\nLet me put this in perspective Rito.\n\nOld player: Could be straight up losing hundreds of hours worth of IP to gain access to a rune system that they already had full access to\n\nNew player: minimal to zero loss to gain access to a rune system that would have taken a hundred hours to get\n\nAnd people wonder why the community is split? Old players are getting completely shafted. New players are gaining a lot for free. Gee sure is weird how half the community is pissed beyond belief and they other half is calling them babies. Wonder why that is?\n\nWhat happened Riot? \n\nhttps://youtu.be/bY67yCaGdno?t=4m12s\n\n> \"Many of you guys have spent a lot of IP on runes already. When we transition over to the new system, we&#039;ll have a plan in place to take care who have invested in runes and rune pages over the years&quot;\n\nWhat happened? You ***told us*** that *you&#039;d have our backs* then you turn around and give us a 25% refund while newer players get 100%? I&#039;m disappointed Riot. This feels like we&#039;re being robbed. Was this your plan to take care of us? I almost feel betrayed after defending you over the years. Even when that video was released I was right here on the boards telling people to have some faith and trust in you instead of freaking out. Then you turn around and do..... this..... to all the players who have supported you over the years. Do we not matter as much because you already have our money?\n\nI&#039;m sure there are going to be a bunch of newer player, hell maybe a few older ones too, that will be here promptly to disagree but I know me and my friends were so very disappointed by this.
