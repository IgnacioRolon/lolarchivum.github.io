It is both, when there is no damage being taken, or if it can outsustain the bleed for the damage taken than you still have sustain.

If you deal damage such that 15% of your physical damage is more than 15% of the damage you've taken recently, congrats, you still have sustain, plus whatever sustain you have from Doran's, runes, masteries, and other lifesteal items.\n\nDon't make things into false binary propositions.  The world is not black nor white but a multifarious blob of different shades of grey.  The least you could do is not truncate your logic into an illogical mess.  DD does not provide sustain or damage reduction.  It provides passive damage off-set coupled with very powerful, extremely easy to use sustain, which when one is actively taking damage, function in tandem as a form of damage mitigation.  Based on a whole host of outside factors, they can either sustain beyond the damage mitigation, or have it function as temporary partial damage reduction in instances wherein they take more damage from the bleed than they can lifesteal. . .\n\nBut this instance only can occur when the ADC is being repeatedly bursted for huge percentages of their max health, or was recently bursted to what would have been a 100-0 without the item, and then were hard CCed so they couldn't attack; or they must have fucked up their positioning to ever be in a case where it might not offer damage reduction ***and*** sustain.  That said, if you didn't have DD you would die outright in either scenario and much faster, I might add, so you will get very little if any sympathy from me in those instances as bar none the safest and most powerful class in League of Legends with the second longest range outside of Artillery Mages, the best pushing power, best objective damage, best teamfight damage, best sustained damage, and lowest resource cost + guaranteed point and click damage, and yet you weren't able to use that plus a metric fuckton of free defensive stats, and an over abundance of other lifesteal, plus sustain from your team now that everyone and their mother builds support and defensive items just to stack on their ADC on top of all the stupid shit like PD, DD, and new GA, not to mention older shit like Maw, BT, BotRK and MS which all just further compounds the sheer, ludicrous value that DD and its damage delay + unique sustain mechanic provide.\n\nEDIT: still don't think it provides damage reduction?  Consider this:\n\nFor a champion with DD to get bursted 100-0 it would take 142.9% damage instead of 100% (142.9 X 0.7 = 100.03)  The enemy must now either waste an additional 43% of the damage it would take to kill you, to overkill the target or they allow that target, who would otherwise already be dead, the time to fight back with damage/CC for at least 3 additional seconds that they wouldn't otherwise have.  \n\nYou probably aren't a tank player, but to those of us who are, this alone is easily recognizable as a huge amount of damage reduction from the other team, if for no other reason than that they must burn 43% more damage on the highest priorty target on your team, who now also has an additional form of damage mitigation to make it take them even longer to die, to allow your team and your support more time to get their CC/exhausts/heals/shields on the ADC, so now they need ***even fucking more burst to kill a target they've already had to almost 50% overkill*** and oh, hey wait?

An overheal is a form of mitigation.  Damage conversion can be a form of mitigation. \n\nIF - and i say this ONLY IF - the bleed damage is HEALED OR SHIELDED, then the ALPHA BURST HAS BEEN MITIGATED. \nIN a SNOWBALL SCENARIO deaths dance CAN BE EFFECTIVE DAMAGE REDUCTION if your HEALING PER SECOND IS GREATER THAN 1/3rd OF THE DAMAGE CONVERTED TO A BLEED.\nYoure purposefully ignoring the HEALING ASPECT of the bleed and WHY THE BLEED IS SO STRONG DEFENSIVELY.\n\nLets put it this way. A man gets his arm chopped off. \nThe chopped off arm is then put into ice and the stub is similarly chilled. \nIF the man can reach a skilled surgeon in time the nerves and blood vessels, chilled by the cold, can be reattached rendering most of the possible damage MITIGATED. \nIF the man does not reach a skilled surgeon in time the nerves and blood vessels will die, inflicting him with the MOST POSSIBLE DAMAGE.\nIn this case, the ice is acting as _damage reduction_ until the man can be healed.\n\n\n_____________________________________________________\nListen guy, the world isnt black and white. Yes the damage is a bleed and with no healing it DOES equal 100% damage. But the purpose of the item isnt SOLELY to delay burst. The purpose of the item is to REDUCE BURST DAMAGE so that IT CAN BE MITIGATED VIA HEALING. Thats the intention of the item. It is _NOT_ wrong to say the item is a damage reduction item, because in the situations it was MEANT to be used it IS EFFECTIVE DAMAGE REDUCTION.\n\nIf someone is saying the item is damage reduction like PD and KV is, then theyre wrong. But in a situation where the bleed CAN BE HEALED AS INTENDED then they are NOT WRONG in saying that its damage reduction.","replies":[{"poster":"Champion Skin","date":"2017-06-25T08:55:49.919+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"> Listen guy, the world isnt black and white.
