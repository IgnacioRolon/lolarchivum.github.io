People don't know what it is. It might look easy to win with LeBlanc and co but as irritating (and strong, wouldn't get used in the LCS otherwise) as they are, they're simply not guaranteed wins and you're right, you'd have an easier time winning with Malzahar or Katarina or Jinx right now.\n\nDisagree that popularity doesn't affect win rate, it's just that it's not the sole factor. Looking into the examples - lots of people play Zed without actually trying to learn his mechanics very well and then get destroyed by people who are actually competent with their champ. Lots of people play Jinx and because she's honestly rather easy to play they are much more likely to do well. Popularity definitely affects win rate but it's not the only factor - ease of picking up is another obvious factor in win rates which allows some popular champs to have much higher win rates than others.","replies":[{"poster":"KaisadiIIa","date":"2015-03-09T16:36:18.385+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also you are forgetting all those people who are first pick and instalock LeBlanc (i.e.), then you just have to pick a counter (Galio, i.e.) and you win the lane easily.

Yeah.  If you can't hit a skillshot, you are bad at the game and we aren't balancing around you.  Sorry.\n\nAhri has 2 straight-line skillshots, a dash, and a press and forget proximity ability.
