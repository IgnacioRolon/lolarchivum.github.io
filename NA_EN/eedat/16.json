You don't own anything. If tomorrow Riot closes and shut down all the servers and you can't play LoL anymore, you won't be entitled to any access or back up of your Runes or anything like that.\n\nSecond, even if we're not pedantic about it, it's an in-game item in a video game, for fuck's sake! It's not canned food on your shelves. It's not even music on your hard-drives. If Riot was deleting your music from your hard-drive, you'd have a good reason to be angry, you wouldn't be able to listen to your music anymore. But your Runes? You can't use them for anything, that's not a good, that's not an item that you own. It's just a line of stat in a game. It's not \"content\", and presenting it that way is dishonest.\n\n________________\n\n> any makeshift justification of \"well you had value out of them for years and you did things with them\" is debunked instantly from the notion that we bought a permanent item at the time that we would be able to use them forever and ever and ever.\n\nNo, that's not true. Your \"permanent\" item was always limited to the lifespan of the game, at most. It was ALWAYS implicit that you wouldn't be able to use your Runes \"forever and ever and ever\". And this time, this is not me being pedantic again, it's an actually important point. Imagine an online game with no subscription, just an initial buying price, like Warcraft 3 or the like. When such a game closes their server because it's too old and no one is really playing anymore, they don't refund all the people who bought the game. Your \"permanent\" access to their servers was never really ACTUALLY permanent, and they have the right to take it from you whenever they want. And when Blizzard made Starcraft 2 free-to-play, they didn't refund all the people who bought the game before.\n\nIt's exactly the same here. Runes were a fee you had to pay to be able to compete on fair ground. Runes are not content. Buying Runes is not buying items, it's just buying the right to play the game (in good conditions). And you DID play the game for all those years since you bought Runes. Now Riot is making the game \"free-to-play\" (let's not forget we're not even talking about real money), and they have no obligation to refund the people who bought the Runes before, who paid the fee years ago.\n\nBecause Riot are not ass-holes, they are giving a partial refund, but this is purely out of good will. They had no obligation to do it. They are simply acknowledging that yes, you spent a lot of time and efforts, so they are giving something back, but they don't have to. And people flame them because they are not giving enough?

Winrate sky-rocketed instantly, clear time decreased by a minute; and I realized what they meant. So instead of buying champions for the next two months I dumped all my ip into runes, afterwards I spent roughly 75% of my ip on runes for the next four months. I hated having so few champions to play, but I knew it would be a better long term investment to buy them up-front than to buy the champions, feeling like they were bad, only to buy runes later and find out that was why. \n\nIf I had known when I was buying them all in late S6, that they would be replaced by the beginning of S8, I would have only bought tier 2 runes and made due with those. I wouldn't have invested so much in getting the best runes for my mains. The fact I made that investment thinking I would use them for probably four seasons before they would either revamp it with better runes to buy or I would retire from league.\n\nFrankly the thing that annoys me the most is that they're giving us static ip back, it's not based on how much we spent, but how much we bought. For instance a Scaling AD Quint that was bought at 515 ip gives 300 ip, but so does a Life Steal Quint bought at 2050 ip. Not exactly fair. I do understand the reasoning to give less for the more someone has used it, so I'm not asking for a full refund(although I don't exactly think S7 people deserve a full refund either, especially those buying in august) but a 75% refund or even a 50% would be much better, otherwise I'm barely getting 20% back, while some people could be getting 60% back. Also although I see the reasoning with less ip the further back you bought them, it's also not fair to spit on those that have been with the game since the beginning. The difference should only be marginal: 75% for S6&S5 players, 70% for S4, 65% for S3, 60% for S2&S1 as an example.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ChompyWulf","date":"2017-09-03T12:43:40.318+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Eedat","date":"2017-09-03T16:42:31.132+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh hey look!

Easy to say that when you weren't buying RP all that time for champions so you could save your IP for those runes. Easy to say when you weren't buying IP boosts with cash so you could grind those runes faster. By the way, runes used to be much more expensive too lol\n\n\"That is entitlement garbage\"\n\nDon't think so bud. You want all the runes with none of the work then you tell people who put in 100+ hours for them to suck it up because you get it for free now. Yeah, I'm the one who is entitled.

I still consider myself a long time player for spending a good amount of time and money on this game. I only have 4 Rune pages, 2 of them already being almost identical. This is because I still don't have that many runes. The prices are ludicrous for runes. I spent more than 10000 on them, and to me, this is a lot. I spent my IP on champions, yet I still don't have all of them. Now try and understand how even older players feel. They could have all the champions, but still not getting the full benefit.","replies":[{"poster":"Eternal Torment","date":"2017-09-02T02:01:18.103+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Point taken, but then again i am just guessing.
