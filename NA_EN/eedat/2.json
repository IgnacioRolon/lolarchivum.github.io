It would be cool if he had some visual prowess as a ninja that ties in with his name (like how Zed is the Master of Shadows and has a shadow ability). For example [ You could rework his on-hit passive to work in coordination with his eyes like \"eye reveals weakspot, swords strike it\". Like {{champion:133}}'s passive]\n\nEDIT: any cheesy name could work for the passive like \"Twilight's Gaze\" or something. I just wanna say that I thought Shen was a cosmic champ when I first saw him (connection to the universe and space around him) because of his title and it would prove reason why he has limitless teleportation powers.

While the shield is active, Urgot gains **armor reducing attacks**.\n\nWhile the shield is active, Urgot's attacks & missiles **reduce (*possibly \"steals\", instead?*) the target's armor by 12/14/16/18/20%** (*same as current/live values, unless you guys intend to change it?*).\n\n* [E] - Noxian Corrosive Charge:  Urgot launches a corrosive charge that damages enemies in an area and **slows targets**.\n\nEnemies afflicted by the charge have their **Movement Speed reduced (*possibly \"stolen\" as well?*) by 20/25/30/35/40%** (*same as current/live values, unless you guys intend to change it?*).  Urgot's basic attacks & missiles also **slow** the target **while they're afflicted**.\n\n-----\n\nMy reasoning for this switch is basically the same reasoning as with Rework {{champion:72}}'s Movement Slow shift to his E-Fracture, and Rework {{champion:79}}' Movement Slow shift to his Q-Barrel Roll (which I also posted about, a *long* time ago:  [Gragas - Switch Enemy Speed Debuffs](http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=2572371)  .)\n\n* Thematic cohesiveness/intuitive logic\n\n* Using a spell that activates a shield (*W-Terror Capacitor*), **just** to be able to use its Movement Slow function, just isn't intuitive in terms of gameplay.  And swapping these functions in his kit would certainly make his gameplay become more intuitive & improve his learning curve.\n\n* Also, using a spell that looks very chromatically similar to {{champion:29}}'s W-Venom Cask (*E-Noxian Corrosive Charge*), but *doesn't* **slow**, is just plain *confusing* (*especially for players who like to play both champions - {{champion:6}} {{champion:29}} - and are trained to think that the abilities are consistent with each other*).\n-----\n\nAdditional Fixes:\n\n* Allow Urgot to move while casting Q & E. \n(**QoL Fix**, *for more intuitive gameplay; helps with learning curve/improving gameplay skills.  I don't remember if he can, or can't, as I haven't yet..'retested' him this week & it's been forever since I've played him, but it doesn't look like he can from his videos*.)\n\n* [R] - Hyper-Kinetic Position Reverser:  Both Urgot & the suppressed target are untargetable until the reversal channel is completed.\n**Reasoning**:\nThis helps solidify the..\"fantasy\" (*original intention/design/vision?*)..of the ult, so that it doesn't simply turn into a glorified Root/Stun, allowing both teams to kill the champions being reversed, while the reversal is still in progress.\nInstead, it forces both teams to wait for the reversal's channel to end, & decide whether to engage a teamfight, peel for/protect their displaced teammate, somehow manage both, or disengage & leave their teammate to die.  (*\"Counterplay\"?*)\n\n-----\n\n(*Trying to think of what else to say, to further flesh-out my ideas, but that's all I've got.  I think I've said it all?*)\n\nAnyways, I hope you guys consider implementing these fixes for Urgot!  =D\nHe's a fun champ that I want to unlock & play more often (*especially with his Battlecast skin!*  =D ), but the current state of his kit has kept me from playing him to the best of my abilities, and my proposed changes would certainly allow me (*& possibly others*) to play him better.\n\n(*I also have some ideas for his larger rework, but I'll save them for when the official thread for that appears*.)\n\nThank you for your time & for reading this!  =D","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"9Lyves","date":"2015-03-10T11:29:41.260+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"@Meddler Can we give Varus some small buffs to?
