Isn&#039;t the point of the Victorious skin to be a champ that was relative in competitive the entire season? Maokai was a flavor for like a month at the end of spring split and beginning of Summer split. \n\nJust off the top of my head here are some champs that deserve it way more than him:\n\n{{champion:22}} {{champion:268}} {{champion:69}} {{champion:245}} {{champion:150}} {{champion:79}} {{champion:104}} {{champion:39}} {{champion:202}} {{champion:43}} {{champion:203}} {{champion:76}} {{champion:2}} {{champion:48}} {{champion:112}} {{champion:8}} \n\nProbably missed a few but thats just off the top of my head.\n\n#Maokai? Really?\n\nHaving finally reached Gold this season I have to admit this is a huge let down. There were so many good options and you picked a super binary, boring as hell, out-of-meta champ. Sorry to sound salty but to be perfectly honest I really am. What a disappointment.","replies":[{"poster":"Hresvelg","date":"2016-10-01T09:30:18.164+0000","up_votes":78,"down_votes":14,"body":"I agree, Maokai is a huge let down. I haven't seen even one in the entire season of ranked, not even in these periods you mentioned, and I have been in gold for a while now. I don't even see the guy in normals. \nI thought the point of these victorious skins were to get champions that influenced the ranked season. Maokai certainly didn't.\nLike, sure, it's fine to give the guy a skin, it's not like Maokai doesn't deserve any skin, just not the victorious one.\nThis is seriously the third year in a row that I am dissapointed by the victorious skin, but I didn't complain about Sivir or Morgana because at least they made sense to be picked! Maokai just doesn't make sense. \nGoing by the order (which since they already got 5 skins they could say screw the order), they'd need a top champ and that means Darius or Ekko seemed very obvious, which would have still sucked for me 'cause I hate Darius, but at least it would make sense!\nNow I'm going to get Maokai forced into my pool of champions.

The Sivir skin is about as unique and interesting as a potato. Very similar to the warden skin only the chakrams have a duller, even less practical edge and it has a slightly a better color scheme. No new particle effects or anything, not like those would have been cool....\n\nWas honestly kinda hoping they'd give the Victorious skin to an ADC and actually do it right or give it to somebody like Twisted Fate who has a ton of skins but only one or two with interesting particle effects. Or maybe give it to Viktor or Cass who have had a tremendous impact but haven't had skins in years. Seriously why would they pick a set known for pretty armor and give it to a tree?
