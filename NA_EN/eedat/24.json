That&#039;s resulted in some champs who have really cool stuff on their kits, but have been challenges to balance for regular play versus top tier play. My take is that there are solid concepts there, but that the execution on them needs some work (reducing unnecessary strengths primarily, and putting that power into other parts of the kit, giving clearer weaknesses to play around).\n\n-Meddler\n\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/cwfTKBxg-riot-meddler-shen-is-the-worst-top-laner-now-because-of-618-nerfs-when-can-we-expect-the-buffs?comment=00010001000000000000\n\n\n#WE DID IT AGAIN BOYS\n\n{{champion:164}}HA{{champion:164}}HA{{champion:164}}HA{{champion:164}}HA{{champion:164}}HA{{champion:164}}HA{{champion:164}}HA{{champion:164}}HA{{champion:164}}HA{{champion:164}}HA{{champion:164}}HA{{champion:164}}HA{{champion:164}}HA{{champion:164}}HA{{champion:164}}HA{{champion:164}}HA{{champion:164}}HA{{champion:164}}HA{{champion:164}}HA{{champion:164}}HA{{champion:164}}HA{{champion:164}}HA{{champion:164}}HA{{champion:164}}HA{{champion:164}}HA{{champion:164}}HA{{champion:164}}HA{{champion:164}}HA{{champion:164}}HA{{champion:164}}HA{{champion:164}}HA{{champion:164}}HA{{champion:164}}HA{{champion:164}}HA{{champion:164}}HA{{champion:164}}HA{{champion:164}}HA{{champion:164}}HA{{champion:164}}HA{{champion:164}}HA{{champion:164}}HA{{champion:164}}HA{{champion:164}}HA{{champion:164}}HA{{champion:164}}HA{{champion:164}}HA{{champion:164}}HA{{champion:164}}HA{{champion:164}}HA{{champion:164}}HA{{champion:164}}HA{{champion:164}}HA{{champion:164}}HA{{champion:164}}HA{{champion:164}}HA{{champion:164}}HA{{champion:164}}HA{{champion:164}}HA{{champion:164}}HA{{champion:164}}HA{{champion:164}}HA{{champion:164}}HA{{champion:164}}HA{{champion:164}}HA{{champion:164}}HA{{champion:164}}HA{{champion:164}}HA{{champion:164}}HA{{champion:164}}HA{{champion:164}}HA{{champion:164}}HA{{champion:164}}HA{{champion:164}}HA{{champion:164}}HA{{champion:164}}HA{{champion:164}}HA","replies":[{"poster":"Sahn Uzal","date":"2017-01-05T13:06:52.882+0000","up_votes":40,"down_votes":6,"body":"Having an overloaded kit =/= having the issues Azir and Kalista have.","replies":[{"poster":"sit kid","date":"2017-01-05T15:18:33.009+0000","up_votes":27,"down_votes":1,"body":"They are overloaded\n\nKalista does litterally everything an adc could ever want.

I'd agree Camille isn't as bad, her Q has lots of delay and her E actually is more telegraphed than people give it credit for but she punishes fast if you're in close range.  Thing is her R has counterplay only for like 18 or so champs and the rest are just forced to stand in it and die to Camille or a teammate so you have to have better stats than her, and her kit is balanced around her having strong pre6.  Her W is also longer than what most top laners have and even if you don't fight with it, its a good sustain tool or chasing tool.\n\nI think if her ult was changed the rest of her kit would feel better.

Given how her kit works, it feels perfectly fine to me. Even in a teamplay setting it sounds fine, because it gives you some way to nullify the enemy's mobility. And you might say \"Well that's not fair because they rely on that mobility to survive.\" That's the risk of a team game with unique characters - you absolutely run the risk of your strength becoming a liability in certain situations.

People wanted J4's ult to still do damage, trap you in a small area, and ground you preventing all mobility/flash meaning you can't escape.  Camilles ult is much larger, has no upfront damage meaning most of it's power is vs tanks not squishies due to the %health damage on autos, has less range, and you can still use mobility spells/summoners in it.\n\nHonestly Camille ult is strong, but not more so than half a dozen other ults I could name.  It also has a lot of weaknesses like sudo trapping Camille because if she leaves the ult ends as well as pushing away other enemies, making her actually be a bad pick on wombo combo teams.  \n\nI don't think it even needs to be nerfed, as the rest of her kit is nerfed it will get toned down at the same time because it's power relies on Camille having power in her basic abilities.  In terms of combat power it is actually pretty weak, so as her kit gets nerfed it will be nerfed since it is only effective if you want to stay in the same area as an enemy.","replies":[{"poster":"Aptest","date":"2017-01-06T11:24:40.214+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think with all the hyper mobile champions now in league, it is about time some champions have skill that pre-empt mobility abuse _without _ disconnecting the other guy's keyboard.\n\notoh i do see the problem. the danger with skills that basically spell: \"X can always convert being head to getting a kill\" is that they create very snowbally champions.
