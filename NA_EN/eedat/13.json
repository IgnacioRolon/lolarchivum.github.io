Pick your poison on which site you use, but Sona is floating around a 57% win rate across all ELOs with around a 20% pick rate now. And no, win rate isn&#039;t everything. **However** if you factor in her play rate quadrupled you must also agree that her average skill level has gone down. Having her average skill level go down while her win rate explodes upwards is a pretty good indicator that she is extremely strong right now.\r\n\r\nSo can we stop pretending she is still fine on this patch?

Her laning phase is heavily dependent on simply getting in range, pressing Q, (Powercording if applicable), and retreating. If she has a higher MS she becomes too much of a lane bully for some other supports (specifically squishy non-healers) to handle. But with a lower MS (like now) she performs rather poorly in lane because she is too easy to catch out of place. They could make her tankier, but a tankier Sona will likely lead to new problems and the solution will again be unfavorable.\n\nHer buffed heal may actually be one of the best approaches at this point.
