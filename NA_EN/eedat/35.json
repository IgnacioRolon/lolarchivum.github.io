That's resulted in some champs who have really cool stuff on their kits, but have been challenges to balance for regular play versus top tier play. My take is that there are solid concepts there, but that the execution on them needs some work (reducing unnecessary strengths primarily, and putting that power into other parts of the kit, giving clearer weaknesses to play around).\n\n-Meddler \n\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/cwfTKBxg-riot-meddler-shen-is-the-worst-top-laner-now-because-of-618-nerfs-when-can-we-expect-the-buffs?comment=00010001000000000000","replies":[{"poster":"Mordepool","date":"2016-11-05T15:39:28.494+0000","up_votes":23,"down_votes":43,"body":"Riot can listen but usually the damage is already done.  \nMordekaiser 5.16.

You&#x27;re able to climb just as well solo as you are in a premade\n\nAre you kidding me!? There were valid reasons why people disliked DQ. Granted there were a few positive well needed changes that were given to us such as choosing your role instead of fighting over it like a pack of wild animals. If you wanted to play and mess around with friends there was Team builder and Normal Draft and Blind pick to choose from, if you wanted to get a bit more serious there was Ranked 5v5. For some reason Riot thought Mixing team ranked and Solo/Duo ranked would be a great idea but it failed and it back fired. \n\n1. DQ was to lessen toxicity but actually did the opposite. 4 man teams would pin the blame on and or report the 1 solo if things didnt go well, Or for shits and giggles. The best case scenario is that the 4 man would be on their curse chat while the solo laner is kinda left out of the loop and have to fend for themselves for the majority of the match. \n\n2.Elo Boosting is in at an all time high, There were posts about Diamond and plats having a boosted bronze/silver on their or the enemy team and it still is a problem. DQ pretty much enabled ELO boosting. \"Oh i'll just ask my Plat friend to get on their smurf and roflmao boost me to diamond or something\"\n\n3. Team balance was terrible. A team of 5 solos getting pitted against a 5 man premade who has curse or skype. You can tell who's in a a premade just by coordination and comp alone. \n\nSo no, people we're not bitching about DQ for \"no reason\"","replies":[{"poster":"LuunaLily","date":"2016-11-06T17:06:49.131+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Tanukihero,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=ncft6YG7,comment-id=000100010000000000000001,timestamp=2016-11-06T08:37:23.323+0000)\n>\n> 1.
