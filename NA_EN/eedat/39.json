I understand wanting to play with friends, but am I like the only person on Earth that doesn't have a friend to play League with 24/7...? Like, I very VERY rarely see a game anymore without a party and it's just as rare to see that party actually communicating with their teammates and not just their Skype/TeamSpeak mates. The parties are also quite quite toxic, which almost feels like it's ENCOURAGED anymore. Maybe I'm just being paranoid and confirmation bias is kicking in, but I feel like Riot is trying desperately to get back their dwindling playerbase caused by radical and unnecessary changes to the game (we had just recovered from S5 and S6 swooped in) as well as overly ridiculous new champions with incomprehensible kits, double-passives, and clearly imbalanced kits that can't be fixed by numbers.\n\n#2: No real benefit for striking out as a solo player. I feel like if Riot wants Dynamic Queue to be accepted, then there needs to be compensation for solo players. I can hear what a DQ defender might say: \"But then they should make some friends in the matches they play!\" Well, here's my retort: Most of us aren't really looking to use League of Legends as a friend-making service. We play League of Legends because we like the game. Making friends really shouldn't be the objective of the game, playing the game to have fun should be. I feel as a solo-queuer faced with the adversities of parties, I should be rewarded for my efforts, especially if I WIN against a party. My proposed change: Solo-queueing for more than 5 games straight (6th and so on) gain 25% bonus IP and champion XP whenever there is at least a duo-queue on the enemy team, increased to 50% on a victory. (playing in a party resets this) Leaving a game and being assessed as such revokes this bonus for 2 weeks or 25 games without a leave. (whichever comes first)\n\n#3: A lack of feedback for reports. This one's pretty simple; there is simply too little feedback for your reports to feel like they do anything. Whenever I see someone being super toxic and I report them, I always assume they WON'T get punishment. In Dota 2, if someone you reported gets punished, regardless if yours was the deciding one or not, you get a popup that tells you that they've been punished.","replies":[{"poster":"Punkkee","date":"2016-07-07T06:23:03.068+0000","up_votes":30,"down_votes":1,"body":"my eyes holy shit","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DrCyanide","date":"2016-07-07T00:55:37.080+0000","up_votes":22,"down_votes":2,"body":"**Games don't feel satisfying.**\n\nI don't know if it's a matchmaking issue (unbalanced teams) or a balance issue (some combination of power creep and unbalanced champions), but it's problematic.

There's always something dominating the game, and it's always annoying to see them EVERY GAME, be it Azir, Lucian, Kindred, Graves. I'm tired of these champions. There needs to be better balance.\n\n3) Movement speed on items. I think Luden's has too much movement speed given (10%). It doesn't need to be that high.

If everyone had equal chance of winning. Why would I pick X over Y? Everyone would pick the easiest champion because they'd have as much chance at winning vs a higher skill cap champion.\nHowever it has come to a point where champions are certainly too dominant and left alone for far 2 long. \nIf a champion has a broken win rate, ban rate and pick rate (when not banned) there is clearly an issue, and this issue should not take months to fix. Hot fix it, crush the broken FOTM pick then buff them slowly over time until they're just right.\n\nPoint 3..... I hate the abundance of movespeed.

IN EVERYTHING!\n\nIn norms people abuse the most broken champs possible, flame and threaten to report you when you do something different (vel, braum, bard jg) and your opponents continue to kill you at every opportunity just to rub in the fact that \"they win and you don't\". How good does it feel for top laner X when top laner Y dives and kills you whenever their ult comes off CD until they don't need it anymore. You may say I'm bad, but that's what happens when you go braum top for a lil fun, only to go up against a darius/riven. There's nothing to be done but die, over and over.\n\nLook at rotating game modes. In the beginning, we were all hyped for urf and one for all. We all probably tried stupid/absurd stuff like donger, karthus, naut, rek sai, bard  and my god the list goes on, just to have a laugh cos they were still so stupid in theory because the modes were still new and we'd never tried it before. It was awesome, it was fun. \nNow when urf comes around, it's riven, zed, kat, nid and some other broken pick. And they power down, wreck you and end the game asap. It's not about having a good game anymore for so many people, it's about winning and getting that S rank, or looking good in front of your team. They don't care about seeing dumb stuff happen, they care about making you see a grey screen for as long as possible.\n\nThen one for all; blitz, riven, Darius, Annie ect. Mean while me and my buds picked bard or naut and proceed to get stomped in 10 minutes. Fun right?\n\nIt's the same in every featured game mode, people don't value to time they have with it, because it'll be back in a matter of weeks. So they treat it like norms and try and trample everyone in their path.\n\n\nThe cause of all this? Riots changes have made it a stomp or be stomped game. NO ONE WANTS TO BE STOMPED. So they try as hard as possible to be the brats doing the stomping. How often do you see people trying to break the meta? How often do they do a kill lane bot or a themed team composition?\nI haven't versed any  of those in over a year, hell it's probably longer than that, maybe even over 2 years. I've played with some because well, my friends liked doing dumb stuff. (One for all doesn't count as a theme btw)\nThe only people I saw doing off meta stuff, are my buds because they despised abusing FOTM and god tier picks. One mained lulu/raka adc, another ad/ap janna mid+top, another AD elise jungle just for a little picture. And I just filled in where I was needed when I played with them, spamming the random champion button until it auto locked me in. Best times were, when we faced another 5man doing something as dumb as our own. But that was years ago, back when kass reigned supreme and tanks were tanks, fighters were fighters. Not bloody burst mages with 5000 hp, tank assassins or hyper mobile juggernauts.\n\nBut now they're gone, they quit because they couldn't play the way they wanted to and enjoy it, because when they did they'd go up against try hards that'd stomp their goofy champion pool beneath their dirty little feet. They'd get salty, and ff at 20 because it was the same dam thing every dam game.\nWe tried aram, but with so many accounts made specifically for aram with only the champions they want, we couldn't escape there either, because we all own nearly every champion, only to get say...... urgot, jhin, sejuani, yorick and singed and go up against a lux, annie, cait, raka and yasuo. \n\n**And don't bother telling me \"Well it's your own fault for picking those champions\", I should be able to pick any champion into any position and expect a reasonable experience. I shouldn't have to drop down to try hard mode just to have a half decent experience where I don't get stomped.**\n\n\nWell that sums me up. {{sticker:zombie-brand-clap}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"xWaters","date":"2016-07-07T01:01:34.235+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":1,"body":"Being blown up and seeing a grey screen in 2 seconds after initiating team fight as a tank.","replies":[{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2016-07-07T13:48:35.409+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"And then seeing no one followed up.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DarkSunSovereign","date":"2016-07-07T10:06:47.254+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"The prevalence of hybrid (Offensive+Defensive) itemization. \nWhy buy Luden's when you can buy RIlay's, deal about the same damage, but be way tankier?\nWhy get a {{item:3108}} on your first back, when you can get {{item:1057}} into abyssal and win trades with it?\nWhy even have a brain, when you can get {{item:3155}} and auto-win lane?\n\nChampions have such high base damages that there aren't really any drawbacks to going hybrid, which obliterates fully offensive and fully defensive itemization any day.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Owl Puff","date":"2016-07-07T01:21:34.616+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"Getting matched up versus a high plat/diamond player on normals...like pls Rito I'm silver for a  reason {{item:3070}} \nNo but seriously, this happens way more than it should.","replies":[{"poster":"RoodToob","date":"2016-07-07T02:40:40.244+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"As a Plat player who plays with friends in bronze/silver all the time, i find it sucks for those I'm against.

I know they are going as fast as they can and I don't wish to rush them (knowing all the work that goes into these things), but at the moment they can only get out 2 class updates a year, and these class updates are pretty much being directed at sub-classes as well as primary classes, meaning there are many more classes to go. At this rate, they are going to have to update a previous class before even getting to the rest.\n\nAs for champ updates, they are doing much better and it's really helping that they are cutting back on new champs so they can focus on updating older ones, but we still have many champs that are extremely out of date.

Then said hero becomes perma banned... and nerfed one day to no viability (hi morde, aatrox and company)\n\n2) Riot's way of making the game enjoyable for beginers (newbies).\nSo, I had a friend last year, with which I've wanted to play some games. She quit at lv8 due to \"i don't dislike the game, but the players are awful\". Do note, she played like 1 pvp game and the rest bot games.\nAnd that's not a singular case. The community itself is driving new players away, and riot does nothing to help mitigate that. While in others games I play (even tho they are mmos). Newbies are welcomed by older players, they are given initiatives and help in their early days to enjoy the game.\nThis doesn't happen here. Last hitting might be an unknown element for you, and even if you figure that out, last hitting without runes and masteries is much more difficult.\nAnd said runes cost much more than champions themselves.\nYou get no flash for a bunch of levels as well, yay.\nIt takes a few weeks to get IP to buy a hero you like (looks, lore, possible playstyle), only to find out you might not really like them.\nAll these factors turn people away.\nBut some will thrive and make their way though all of that to play the game. What type of players are they? the competitive ones\n\n3) Killing the competitiveness of the game and turning it casual\nto the point that you don't even have to spend your time to \"learn how to properly play\" a champion and just \"pick what's OP and press random buttons ftw\".\n\nAnd finally\n4) Many initiatives for teamplay (premades), zero initiatives for solo players\nwhy is this a problem?\nbecause lets say you want to grow a plant. You keep feeding her water. And more water and more water.\nBut you don't give a shit about the land it grows on. Eventually the piece of land will run out of minerals and your plant withers away.\n\nYes, its great that LoL is a team game. And team play is important. However there's only 2+3 and 5s in the premades group that can live without solo players. The other combinations all need 1 or more solo players. So, if you don't take care of them, you are essentially cutting the branch on which you've build your tree house. Slowly and surely, its gona crack, break and ruin your house.\n\nWith the state of the game atm. It doesn't look like the new players joining will make up for those that are quitting.\nAnd that's Lol's current issue. They chosen a short term $ effective solution (play with friends boys) which is going to ruin any hopes they had for this game to be high successful for years. Well, it already had like 6 years, so my take is that they decided it was enough for the investment made, as such from now on milk it till it dies and disregard the playerbase's feelings.","replies":[{"poster":"Raid Boss Morde","date":"2016-07-07T10:29:34.612+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"As for your point 1, you're only half-right. If Riot listened to the community on everything on the PBE, then Viktor would be even more broken than he currently is. I remember everyone on the boards saying how terrible and trash Viktor will be (specifically Malicious Metal, he had a highly upvoted post). Turns out, Riot was correct, and Viktor was no where near terrible after his mini-rework, he's actually one of the best mid laners now.\n\nAlso, before you say \"Riot changed Viktor/buffed him because of community feedback\", that post that got highly upvoted was made **after** Viktor got buffs on the PBE. If Riot had listened to the community on that, then Viktor would be even stronger than he is now.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CrazFight ","date":"2016-07-06T22:20:05.076+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"Solo Queue > Dynamic queue.","replies":[]},{"poster":"zlumpy","date":"2016-07-06T22:33:07.025+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thats a tough one...\n\nI geuss it's the mobility creep that ends up making non mobile champions almost useless at times.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Supreme Senpai69","date":"2016-07-07T06:19:04.227+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"I dislike how certain champions take no skill but certain champions require a lot of skill, but the payout is nearly the same. I also hate how not every champion is viable. No skill champions should be good for learning the game and for getting through bronze if you aren't good. They should be a solid and safe pick where you won't carry anyone but you also won't feed. I hate things that are point and click.\n\nI also hate how one person doing extremely well can't really carry 4 people, but one person doing extremely poorly can lose the game for the other 4. It makes the game feel like chance; who will get the feeder? If nobody feeds then the better team wins.","replies":[]},{"poster":"1000angrybees","date":"2016-07-07T05:01:31.565+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"I'd say its a heavy combination of everything. \n\n-**Too much CDR**\n-**Snowballing** too hard, too fast.\n-**Too much damage** happening in short spans of time.
