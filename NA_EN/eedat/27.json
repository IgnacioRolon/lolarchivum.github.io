You have to anticipate the flow of the fight and manually position them correctly in advance. Failure to do so means you lose a large chunk of your DPS.\n\nKog, in comparison is extremely easy mechanically. Kog's spells account for a very small amount of his damage in an actual team fight. The biggest thing you need to do as Kog is position correctly. This is an example of game knowledge, not mechanics. This applies to all immobile damage sources.
