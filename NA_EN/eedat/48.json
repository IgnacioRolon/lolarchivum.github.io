Charge $20-$25 (&euro;16 - &euro;20) for a new account. Of course, accounts that have been made already will be grandfathered in, but not receive the content. \n\nOf course, there would have to be some other changes. Give these new accounts a pre-selection of 20 champs of varying different roles. In addition, give these accounts 10 champion selector vouchers that can be used to purchase champs of their choice. Give them 4 rune pages instead of the default 2. Maybe some cosmetics? Honestly this would just be being genrous at this point but maybe 2 vouchers for 975-1350RP skins and one 1820 RP skin voucher? Or perhaps a couple of cosmetic-only hextech boxes.\n\nBenefits:\n\n1) would severely reduce the number of bots new players have to deal with. Contrary  to popular belief, the majority of these bot account get banned. They get banned in waves as opposed to one by one which is why you see these accounts get a bunch of games in. The solution the botters use is just sheer numbers. Just keep pushing tons of these bots through and some of them will make it just by sheer sample size. If they were charged $25 ***per attempt***, the price per account that made it would be so ridiculously high that there would be no way they could make money on it.\n\nPoof, botters gone.\n\n2) Pseudo deterant for people coming back after getting permabanned. Listen, I&#039;m no dummy. I know $25 isnt some insurmountable amount of money. I&#039;m aware this wont stop the majority of people from buying a new account. Maybe it would stop ***some*** though.\n\n3) This one is more for Riot. Its obvious there is a large market for alt accounts. A quick Google search pulls up dozens of sites selling cheap unranked accounts. Why not aquire that revenue  for yourself? Its very apparent that there is a lot of money to be made on new accounts\n\n4) A better new player experience. The twenty preselected  champs plus the free champion rotation will give new players plenty to entertain themselves with. The vouchers give them more chances for when they inevitably buy a champ they dont end up liking. The current 3 refunds for the life of the account system is pretty brutal. This system also removes the wall in front of draft pick.\n\nNow those are some benefits. Lets take a look at some possible drawbacks.\n\n* ***Would this make it easier for banned players with disposible income to come back?*** I agree in some cases it would. However, these are the players that just buy a cheap smurf account online. So if they want to spend the money, theyre coming back anyway or just making a new free account.\n\n* ***The F2P model is more enticing to people who haven&#039;t played before.*** I normally would agree, but LoL is such an established game at this point that you more or less know what you&#039;re getting. F2P models work for newer, unknown games. Once you&#039;ve reached the level of a game like LoL, its not really needed. \n\n* ***Thats a lot of content for $25 if you compare to &agrave; la carte prices. Won&#039;t Riot lose money?*** Honestly I dont think so. Maybe you could not include the cosmetic content in the package. Honestly I think by creating happier customers they are more willing to spend money in the future. By giving them 10 champ vouchers, I think people will be more inclined to buy cosmetics for them over the cheap champs people pick up to access draft pick.\n\n\nSo what do you think? Good idea?

That's not saying \"LEAGUE IS DYING EVERYONE ABANDON SHIP\" but is more like saying that League of Legends has a solid fanbase that will keep up with LoL events, games, and the like. Some people have moved on, but the people who truly enjoy the game have stayed. You can see that with other games too, like Overwatch for example. I remember that game being super popular on release, but now it's around a constant viewer number (I know shorter time frame but can apply to other games as well, I guess.

Once you hit level 10/15, you can no longer play games without paying up. You're told this right off the bat of course, and you're also told all the content you're going to unlock by buying it. The point is to keep people joining league for free, if they don't know by level 10/15 that they like the game, then they're probably never going to spend money on it.\n\nSecond, the preselected 20 champs should all be cheap ones (all 450s or maybe some 1350s), to avoid giving too much value. Those champions should probably then be removed from the store or something (so new players don't immediately see they were just given all the cheap stuff). \n\nThird, vouchers for champions should specify a BE threshold. Otherwise new players may feel obliged to use them all on 6300s even if they want other stuff. Honestly, I think it'd be better to just give them blue essence or a variety of champion shards (random mix with pre-determined number at each tier). \n\nSkin vouchers likewise should be determined to prevent value being too high. It may be better to give a starting chunk of Orange essence, a (couple/few) skin-only hextech chests, and one voucher for up to a 1350 skin of your choice.\n\nThe advantage of illegitimate account buying being replaced isn't necessarily realistic, since players don't want to level up to 30. Existing players with an account in good standing should be able to log in to that account to make the new account start at 30.\n\nThe disadvantage for banned players returning is probably not there, due to the cost and inability to purchase at 30 without an account in good standing (unless they're regularly banned and keep one good account to always use on this, but if an account is used to create an account at 30 and that account gets banned, the other account could also be banned or at least ineligible to create more accounts (or could limit to 1 per account, because the purchased account could be used for the next one).  So I'm saying we can get around that downside.\n\nI'd argue I got around the f2p downside with the pay at level 10/15 concept.

Think about it from an outsiders prospective If you watched a video or had a friend who played, would you join? its a very big and complicated game that rewards knowledge and has a long learning process that can deter people from paying. It can feel unrewarding. No say you have this free trial over your head, you could play for free for a month and then suddenly decide \"You know what, I'm not interested enough to pay for this game.\" The free trial acts a a buffer for you decide whether or not you like a product, and League I don't believe is an instantly likable product. Even the champion vouchers and such that you mention, not only do they far outweigh the cost proposed(3 6300 champions is about 20$ I believe), but their are so many champions to pick from that it can often incur feelings of regret.

Absolutely no Pay-to-WIn (now that Runes are free). And the \"extra content\" (i.e. new champions) can all be earned over time. It doesn't even require expensive hardware, just a toaster. All you can pay for currently are cosmetics and getting champions faster.\n\nWhich means LoL is a veeerry accessible game, from a financial standpoint, which is important to keeping new players coming and allowing League to become \"an eSport for generations to come\". I doubt Riot would make a 180 on that principle and suddenly start charging new players just to make an account.\n\nThat being said, there are certainly a lot of benefits to requiring payment. #1 being that bans actually mean a lot more, especially to botters. And I guess parental control is a bit easier (idk, I'm not a parent).\n\nHonestly, it would probably be worth it at this point. Like you said, the F2P model is for new games/companies that need to find new players ASAP. Overwatch has largely the same business model as League, but they could put a 60$ box cost on top because it's a Blizzard game. And at this point League is in the same position.\n\nI just don't see them making the switch at this point, because it upsets the status quo of so much. If Riot actually wanted to do it, they would first and foremost have to win over the community on the platform that \"Smurfs are bad.\" Otherwise, people would just be too outraged for it to be worth it, because up until now people have been really enjoying (and sometimes abusing) the free extra accounts, and Riot has more or less condoned it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mcsquzzy","date":"2018-04-09T21:31:43.409+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I say all champs in the 3150 and below should be free if they make it pay too play, and $5 should no longer be the price of lowest tier skins, it should be 2 but these be my opinions and i be fine with how things are now for now","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ok sure but why","date":"2018-04-09T19:08:35.968+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"I'd like a new account\"\n\"Haha, GRIND!!!!!!!
