What you wrote was a little confusing but I'm pretty sure I got the jist of it. \n\nThat being said, I wasn't talking about every situation I was talking about the one ZLUMPY stated. In that case you should be showing up to take pressure off that lane. I play jungle, I know, it's hard, you have a lot to juggle and sometimes you aren't sure what would be best. However in this instance showing up to take pressure off that lane to give them some room to move around isn't a bad call. \n\nI'm not saying it's the best idea in every situation, because it isn't, but in this one it seems like a pretty reasonable plan.  \n\nAs well I think you are blowing it out of proportion, one instance of you losing a buff or dying isn't going to cause the other two lanes to lose drastically all of a sudden? Showing up bot, just to let it be known that you are around, isn't going to cost you your buff bot side unless you personally really mess up and get yourself killed. While I can agree that you want to try and help the lanes that are going even get ahead, I also feel it's a good idea to help the lane that is struggling a bit out unless they are just a hopelessly lost cause. Which I didn't feel was the case here, especially depending on the lane matchup. Twitch, Kog, Jinx these are really amazing later game carries, but they struggle a bit early especially against the abuse a Cait, Lucian, or Ashe could deal out. In this instance it would be in your best interest to pop up bottom, especially with a Soraka in that lane as well. I don't know all the details of the matchup obviously but you get my point. \n\nAgain I do think you are blowing it a bit out of proportion. It would have to be a lot of bad calls in a row for you simply showing up bot side to cost you the entire game.

So yes ganking is your job. Just like its OUR job to come assist you if you get Counter jungled. If other laners are free, then yes they also do gank, but it isn't THEIR jobs to roam because they do not have the same freedom as a jg does. They do have to try and dominate  their lane and obtain the upper hand so they may roam like a jg can and help the team. You on the other hand are free to roam and rarely do you have to dominate your jg. If no lane is under heavy pressure then your job is simplified and can simply focus dragon/baron/crab (if there's a kindred) or maybe even counter jg or focus on towers.

It happens to everyone.

Me buy a pink ward? So seriously, I'd miss a gank opportunity in a lane where my lanemate needs to gain his power back, and expect that ward to stay alive while I'm gone? I have a better chance of placing a free ward there and seeing the ward being placed, and avoid the situation for greener pastures altogether.\n\nAlso, Mid lane? That shortest, hardest gank to close in the game, championed by champions like Viktor (AoE protective stun, especially against melee junglers... or all junglers), Leblanc, Azir (mobility), Yasuo (temporarily immune to CC projectiles), and some of the fiercest ranged CC in the game? No wonder you're salty. You're probably still playing some shrimpy mid with no protection, or simply can't use the protection within your kit for some reason. Safest lane from ganks by far. Even a perfect approach on a wardless flank is rarely a win, most of which turn into a countergank and dead allied laner because 4 of the 6 jungle camps are *always in pretty close range*.\n\nIt should also be noted that junglers have exactly zero stats in lane until 1200+ gold into their builds, with the questionable benefit from Chilling Smite being your only contribution outside your normal kit. Get boots, you have the speed you need, but still lack any other stats until 1500+ gold. Meanwhile, every laner generally has a Doran's item, boots, and probably some protection against your allied laner's primary damage type as well, on top of their extreme flightiness and utility.\n\nIf you are seeing such amazing opportunities for ganks, my money says that you're simply not adapting to the safest lane in the game, which doesn't need much at all to be untouchable by the jungler.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Grand Eleven","date":"2016-07-02T20:08:57.035+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dear Top,\nI'm not your support.\n\nSincerely, \nthe Jungler.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DarthSpectrum","date":"2016-07-02T19:35:11.793+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I once also believed that it is the laner's responsibility to ward the gank paths and avoid ganks from the enemy jungler.\nHowever, as I improved my mechanics, I realized that sometimes it is impossible as a laner to stop a competent jungler from ganking.\n\nSince the removal of Green Wards, it is impossible to ward every possible gank path. Against decent opponents, when I suspect that the enemy jungler is close to my lane, I either have to risk being ganked or back off and lose considerable amount of farm.\nI understand that some lanes are just difficult to gank. Nonetheless, if the enemy is playing someone like Rek'Sai or Eve, at least be ready to counter gank.\n\nIf I am playing champions such as Fizz or Zed, it is on me to escape a gank. But if I am playing someone such as Xerath or even Viktor, there is nothing I can do if they choose to tower dive me. At best I can trade 1 for 1 unless they misplay. \nI know that in lower ELOs there are players who just refuse to cooperate, but I have watched too many of my ranked games end in defeat because my jungler spent the first ten minutes PvEing.\nEven if the jungler is playing Warwick, he can still walk into lane and scare off the enemy jungler.\n\nSo please, I know that junglers are not required to gank for anyone, but applying pressure and setting up appropriate counter ganks are essential tasks of a good jungler.
