His ganks are also lower opportunity cost due to his method of clearing the jg, meaning his ganks have more uptime. \nHis Q cd is really low for its snare duration as well, can make chasing an ivern or escaping one incredibly difficult in the jungle (and gives his team a lot of time to collapse)\nHis W prior to this nerf made contesting objectives a lot harder if he brought along a pink ward the enemy team literally could not get vision of the objective without being on top of it. This nerf isnt the hardest hit ever but he still has immensely good vision denial on drakes and baron.\nHis E cd is really low and it doesn't lose the slow if you break the shield making an allies engage even stronger or even harder to punish them since its cd is also low, artificially inflating a targets hp by quite a bit throughout a teamfight.\nDaisy isnt tibbers no, but daisy brings her own CC, and is a HUGE body block. can be exceptionally annoying and is yet another feather in Iverns Utility Cap.\n\nAnd the biggest thing...Ivern doesnt need combat stats in the jungle. His clears are the exact same whatever he buys. So he buys items that push his Utility even further. He buys the High impact support items, but his budget isnt a supports, it is a junglers. Meaning he gets redemption, locket, and other items even earlier than a support could, and when you end up putting it all together you get a person that is just a huge walking ball of utility that enables his team insanely hard. And since everyone plays a carry it seems, he has plenty of people to just make it so much easier for a person or 2 to just run over a game with him and the other support behind them making them insanely hard to kill, and insanely hard to peel. \n\nUnfortunately this also makes him a very hard target to nerf. hitting his jungle clear instantly guts him as other junglers will walk all over him and not let him get anywhere. His Q being so loaded makes number hits not as impactful, unless you hit the root duration and cd, nothing else much matters to him with it.  They hit his W in the only way they could. His E needs a cd increase, and/or to make it if they enemy breaks the shield that it loses the slow/damage. His ult is honestly fine, only thing I would hit on it, is make daisy a little smaller so I could stop fckn clicking daisy instead of the carry she is standing on top of. And Redemption needs a nerf, or less perfect synergy with locket. Those 2 items fit so well together with the actives/stats on them that it is nasty strong when you get both even on supports.","replies":[{"poster":"Ivern and Irelia","date":"2017-04-23T07:39:37.442+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"-Youre right, theres not much they can do to his passive without destroying him. \n\n-For his Q, increasing the Cd at lower ranks would be a suitable nerf, as well as lowering the time window for the follow up Dash \n\n-Theres not much more they can do for his W \n\n-Ah, now for this part. For a while now ive seen many people saying that the dmg portion should be lost when the sheild breaks, but doing that would truely strip alot of dmg from Ivern. In the majority of cases (particularly in the mid and late game) his shield is broken before the dmg activates. So making his shield like sion's would ultimately make him lose his main source of consistant dmg. Any Ivern main, especially those of us who have been playing him since day 1, knows that he is currently sitting at his weakest state. So making this E change would really just force Ivern to **only** build support items, as it would be completly pointless to build dmg because the shield dmg would never proc.  My proposition for some e changes would be to lower the Base shielding and dmg of the E, while increasing the Ap ratios for it. \n\n-Cant forget Daisy! Daisy has defintely seen better days, and in all honestly she is much too underpowered at the moment. With the armor/mr reductions and the removal of her self regening, daisy dies Far too quickly now before she can do any real dmg (which is already poor to begin with). So i think a good change would be to up the Cd for Iverns R at all ranks, while increasing daisy's stats. \n\n\n[I actually have many more ideas (fleshed out ones) for potential changes to ivern to make him feel more fair to play against while making him more suitable to play has (outside of just stealing enemy camps and using that 8 minute redemption). I may be making a post discussing them soon, so look out for that]","replies":[{"poster":"Tormentula","date":"2017-04-23T17:31:19.639+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly, if they just lower the cooldown of his E I might find him a bit more tolerable.\n\nHe gets his core items too easily, his E is on such a spammable cooldown, and he has everybody's most favoritate playstyle: the your jungle is now mine and only early game champions who can punish it will do well playstyle. I remember watching LCS yesterday and one of the casters even said \"I believe graves is meta cause ivern is and graves can punish ivern like early game junglers\"\n\nI have no idea how they can fix his \"support budget with a jungler's income\" problem, but its a major one.

Ivern loses a duel to nearly every champion in the early game without stats.  He's not an exceptional duelist on his own, and any early-game jungler will walk all over him without team assistance.  I like to think of him as a rich support, being able to build Redemption, Locket, Athene's, etc. and supplement his team's power - just like you said.  The main issues are exactly what you pointed out - interactions like him keeping the shield slow and damage even if it breaks makes it very unrewarding for the enemy team, as Ivern will just throw a shield on his Diver and have an AoE slow to the entire enemy team now.  He's always going to be in a problematic spot in Summoner's Rift regardless of changes due to his passive allowing him to freely clear jungle camps without requiring any items, however I feel that with a few Quality of Life changes (like the recent W nerfs) will greatly help push him into a more stable position.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
