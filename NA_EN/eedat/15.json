Unless you want to count her ult as well, and that can only be used on allies and doesn't knock up enemies unless they're in range. Her E being the shield and on-hit modifier and her ult being a sort of heal.\nSona's only targeted CC is her empowered E auto, and I suppose her empowered W auto if you want to add that as well. Her ult is a skillshot. Her W is her heal and shield 2-in-1, with both values being incredibly low at rank 1 but gaining effectiveness as you level up since the cooldown goes down by a large margin.\nJanna has a targeted slow (which is annoying in any situation given how fast she can be), and then her Q which is a knockup gaining range and speed the longer you hold it, with the knock up duration having a max of 1.25 seconds. Her E being her shield and her ult being a heal per second with a knock-back on activation.\nThen Soraka has her silence, which can be categorized as a skillshot, which also has a delayed root if you stay in the circle. Obviously her heals being W and R, with her W costing her own health.\nBard has a stun only if he hits two enemies or an enemy and a wall, and then his ult. His heal gains more effectiveness if it charges for the full 10 seconds.\nKarma has a delayed root, probably the only point and click hard CC ability of the group that stops movement. It's reliability goes up when she speeds herself up and uses her empowered Q. Of course, her shield is her E which can also be empowered to shield everyone with the main target getting more shielding.\nSimilar case with Rakan, where his W's reliability increases when used in combination with his ult. Even then, that's his combo, and he can't CC you again until his W comes off cooldown, which then depends on if the enemies don't move fast enough to get out of the circle, or they flash away. His E is a short dash and his Q heal depends on you hitting a champion or epic monster.\nI suppose you can also throw Zilean in here, and since his targeted slow at max rank is 99% for 2.5 seconds, which can also be refreshed with his W, and then giving him easy access to land his bomb stun for 1.5 seconds. His only heal is his ult, and that's situational where his targeted ally needs to fall in combat.\n\nSo for the future, don't go around complaining about enchanter supports having point and click hard CC with shields/heals, because that's not true.","replies":[{"poster":"Attticus Finch","date":"2017-12-12T05:57:58.634+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":6,"body":"\"This enchanter support has a point and click CC ability BUT it doesn't count because...\"\n\n\"This enchanter support has a point and click CC ability BUT it doesn't count because...\"\n\n\"This enchanter support has a point and click CC ability BUT it doesn't count because...\"\n\n\"This enchanter support has a point and click CC ability BUT it doesn't count because...\"\n\n\nThe amount of desperate apologist nonsense in your post is hilarious.","replies":[{"poster":"TonyTonyMordecai","date":"2017-12-12T16:51:04.487+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Where was I desperate or apologist?\nI never discounted any of their point and click cc, I just listed the healing/shielding abilities alongside their abilities that counted as CC, saying that a lot of them were skillshots when they had hard cc and the point and click were more of the soft cc (slows and whatnot).\nHowever, I'm glad you find humor in this.
