You do not get an instant 14 day ban for using it in game.\r\n\r\nI am referring to the R word that is slang for people with mental handicaps or learning disabilities.\r\n\r\nI felt the need to explain this because I've seen quite a few people be confused about this since it's censored on this board. I've even seen Specialists on this board tell people that using it gets you an instant 14 day ban in game. This is incorrect. R%%%%% is considered toxic and will definitely contribute to you moving up the punishment ladder, but it's not a zero tolerance phrase.\r\n\r\nThe word was censored on this board only about 2 months ago entirely at the moderation team's discretion, not Riot's. You can read about the decision to do this here:\r\n\r\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/community-moderation/i1T5Hmxp-individual-word-censorship-on-the-boards\r\n\r\nI also got further confirmation which you can view here:\r\n\r\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/community-moderation/BNzMgycE-need-moderator-confirmation","replies":[{"poster":"Kelg","date":"2019-02-24T08:28:47.545+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"idk i reported someone that said it and I got the ban notice for them immediately","replies":[{"poster":"PH45","date":"2019-02-24T09:28:04.751+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Might've just been a chat restriction, not a 14-day ban.","replies":[{"poster":"Kelg","date":"2019-02-24T12:28:30.445+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=PH45,realm=EUNE,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=5FOAOZxA,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2019-02-24T09:28:04.751+0000)\n>\n> Might've just been a chat restriction, not a 14-day ban.\n\nI don't think it should be a 14 day or perma tbh.
