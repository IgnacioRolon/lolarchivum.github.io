That isn't a conversation though, that's a speech. There's no back and forth. There's no expanding the developers understanding of the community opinion. There is no attempt to understand whats being complained about. It is this approach to communication that led to them not understanding the problems with dynamic queue for 6 months. They were talking about all the great features without listening to the problems. They reply to the things they want to talk about, instead of what needs to be talked about. They used to have conversations about gameplay on the old forums, really going back and forth with the community, but that doesn't happen anymore. \n\nThey talk about the direction of the game without listening to concerns.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"AirKingNeo","date":"2018-04-20T23:46:58.078+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"> They dont even check the Dev Corner page.

At the end of the day, the reason most design talk takes place there, rather than on Gameplay, is because the Dev Corner is a designated spot for perfectly packaged announcements that does not need to relate in any way to what the community's been discussing elsewhere. Some devs do respond to the comments, but their responses frequently either repeat what they've already said before, or simply tackle softball questions, while ignoring more serious complaints or giving them complete non-answers. There is no real two-way communication, and the disconnect between the devs and the players is palpable on there.\n\nI think a good example of proper two-way communication was when Jinxylord asked for feedback on the Rengar revert: throughout the entire process, he asked players for ideas and input, which he implemented directly into his changes, and generally took the time to try to understand what it is players wanted out of Rengar, instead of just sharing his thoughts and following his own direction exclusively the entire time. It is because of this healthy communication that the Rengar revert turned out so successful, and it surprises me that more devs do not try to do the same thing in view of this success, especially since so many clunkers have been the direct result of poor communication with players.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Dr Dog","date":"2018-04-20T16:13:41.731+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":7,"body":"its more of the fact they (for the most part) ignore big issues, let things go through even when they have virtually no positive feedback and even when they dont work out they continue to try to balance the changes instead of getting rid of them like they should and it creates more and more problems, or they once again dont listen and give us a half assed non solution like the janna \"nerfs\" and the tower buff that pretty much beame a nerf because of the minion changes with it","replies":[]},{"poster":"GigglesO","date":"2018-04-20T20:16:46.458+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Eedat,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=J6iLNngT,comment-id=,timestamp=2018-04-20T16:05:08.453+0000)\n>\n> They dont even check the Dev Corner page.

An official Rioter that's likely working on them. You were probably not going to get this information by someone from the skins team. What about the things he mentioned wasn't aligning with what \"we\" wanted?\n\nPeople want Marksmen nerfed.\nThat's fine. But if they are the DPS class, they're likely not going to lose this capability. What would've been the point of a Marksman in a game if they weren't able to do their job properly? This isn't about gutting a class, this is about fixing the issues they have. The issue is too easy (cheap) itemization, too soon damage boost (1.5+ items) and crit getting out of hand, almost competing for burst in terms of Assassins and Mages alike.\n\nWhat this means?\nWe'll see on the PBE in the following weeks for the next few patches.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"GinormousVner","date":"2018-04-20T18:20:03.840+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":12,"body":"I unironically am glad that the developers don't communicate with this cesspool of a board.\n\nI still haven't seen a single thread of substance.
