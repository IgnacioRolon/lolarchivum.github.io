[Champ Select]","subforum":"Client Discussion","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why cant you select your skin in champ select until after **everyone** has locked in? Like if you&#039;re first pick you have to wait until every single person locks in before you get the option of picking your skin.\r\n\r\nCan you change that? Why can&#039;t I pick my skin after I lock in my champ? Why do I have to wait?","replies":[{"poster":"Riot a huevo","date":"2016-11-19T15:42:50.667+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, we are not happy with it either. Although we are not looking to immediately change that single aspect of champ select, we are looking into how to more holistically improve champ select, UX and performance wise.","replies":[{"poster":"Eedat","date":"2016-11-19T16:40:29.284+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the quick response :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DarkVo1d5028","date":"2016-11-19T21:13:47.461+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also...  We are not able to swap champions before everyone has selected a champion.\nLeaving this to be one of the LAST changes to be made in champ select, shortens the time for reactive changes to mastery pages","replies":[]},{"poster":"RevnantSoul","date":"2016-11-19T18:06:38.514+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Isn't it obvious? They want you to stay at your computer not select your champ and then afk till the game loads. Personally I haven't seen a way to change skins in Ranked or Norms only in Blind. For a company that thrives off of skin purchase, it makes no sense to me that they would complicate their income. personally I'm not going to spend any more money on these skins you cant even keep because its just a money drain. Pointless to even spend money on this game anymore. After thinking about it it's a complete waste of my money for something I can't even have. Do you really think this game will last forever? and what of all that money spent on this game? Down the drain and for nothing.","replies":[]}]}
