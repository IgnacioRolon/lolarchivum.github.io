The amount of Orange and Blue Essence you get out of them has gone down ***drastically.*** The amount of Orange Essence you get for disenchanting is now half. Blue Essence from disenchanting is obviously down as well. This is a warning to just buy the skin you want instead of opting for lootboxes.\r\n\r\nThis is not thread debating &quot;Yeah, but we get more shards from leveling!&quot;. Whether we do or do not, this isnt a thread discussing that. This is specifically for lootboxes purchased with RP. The message of this thread is simple:\r\n\r\n***Although the RP price of lootboxes has remained the same,*** the value of the content in those boxes has dropped by ***half*** compared to a box you bought a week ago. Until there is some form of compensation for purchasing them with RP, do not buy any.","replies":[{"poster":"Stick In Mudd","date":"2017-11-11T23:38:46.097+0000","up_votes":61,"down_votes":1,"body":"Riot probably should take a look at the box prices.

Their worth might not have changed based on their perception. Lootboxes can now drop chest + key, additionally there is bad luck protection. Yeah it's not much from my point of view either, but they literally drastically nerfed OE from disenchanting because you get extra box every blue moon at milestones that may not even drop OE based content.\n\nSo If they actually thought the boxes from leveling are good enough reason to drop the worth of shards, they will certainly defend themself that these minor changes to lootboxes maintain their prize.\n\nAlso lootboxes were never really worth buying with RP even before. Maybe in very special cases when you lacked minor amount of OE to redeem content you got from free chests, but other than that it's overpriced since you don't instantly get the content inside but need several chests to grind OE AND you can end up getting content you could've grinded for free.\n\nRiot's purchasable lootboxes were always scam. It's just that some people probably really love this company when they go crazy and scream \"hazard\" with every other company applying unfair lootboxes, but they don't mind the fact they can actually get content worth less than what they paid If it comes from someone they like.\n\nIt's been whale-bait up to this point so why should they now change it?

What people want depends on what's their prefered champion pool and what skins they actually want out of them.\n\nIf they have many skins, loot boxes sound like a perfect idea. Whatever they get sounds like a perfect plan to stock up on any skin cheaper than what you can buy in the store. But even Riot has said that if you want something specific, the cheapest option is to buy it directly, not from loot boxes.\n---\nWhen you have a mini-game of chance in any game, always assume you're getting the short end of the stick. You can get incredibly lucky and get that rare perfect thing it's advertised or you can get nothing, most of the time.

You get 5 items (off the top of my head) and even if they're all sprays they go towards unlocking everything in the game. Duplicates also hardly ever occur now ever since the changes awhile ago. Oh oh, and here's the best part.....you get actual content and not shards AND you can open the chest straight away!\n\nOh, and you know that essence you have?
