Frozen heart gives you the armor which is better than no armor and an attack speed reduction, which is pretty vital to the shit amount of attack speed Darius already has. \n\nYou or in this case, the player, should be building a combination of both armor and health. Armor because he deals purely physical damage outside of his ult and health to counter his true damage. Building a {{item:3143}} or {{item:3742}} is pretty effective against him because of the armor and health. Just to make sure, he doesn't \"shred\" armor, he penetrates anyone's armor for himself. It only becomes shredding when he has {{item:3071}} which is all the time. The last statement isn't a big thing.\n\nLastly, armor is never useless. They changed his passive from magic damage to physical and nerfed the damage so that you can build defense against him. A prime example that does well against Darius is {{champion:58}}. He has heal and high damage. He also has \"shredding\" capabilities that is also tied to his escape. He can successfully harass safety and get out without having to worry about getting pulled in. His Ult gives him HP which is a big plus. \n\nFrozen Hearts efficiency is not solely tied to just Darius. It is also tied to the whole enemy team. if everyone is on you, then you basically have a 75% attack speed reduction in total (15% for each champion).

Now you actually have to think about which item to buy, especially with the new tank items thrown into the mix.\n> \n> PS: Can people stop putting \"Official\" in front of things to make it sound like they know what they are talking about? It's not from Riot so obviously it's not official.\n\nUntil you realize that most attack speed champs that are not ADC have on-hit magic and/or true damage effects. In addition, they tend to build tanky, and with a small amount of HP or magic resistance, they take little to no damage from Thornmail.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Troll for Trump","date":"2015-10-25T07:13:11.210+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Darius always had 25% armor pen prerework. He gets the 25% at max  rank E, he ALWAYS maxes it last, so it's usually 5% for a while.\nStop adding true damage it's pointless. And I'm fine with armor pen, heck, Talon gets armor pen runes, masteries, Youmuus, Last Whisper, and Blackcleaver, and your armor is basically nothing. Even with the older armor.","replies":[{"poster":"dangopee","date":"2015-10-25T22:24:55.927+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You max E second now. No reason to max W second as the only thing leveling it does now is reduce its cool down by one second, nothing else, no damage increase or slow increase whatsoever. Leveling E reduces its cool down by 3 seconds and gives 5% more armor pen. It's just better all around.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Boswick","date":"2015-10-25T20:14:08.301+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thornmail needs it at the very least.
