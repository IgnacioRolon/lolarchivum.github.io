First off, he&#039;s at a 55% win rate. You can check [here at op.gg](https://na.op.gg/champion/malzahar/statistics/mid) and [here at champion.gg](http://champion.gg/champion/Malzahar/Middle?league=). Its pretty obvious that he&#039;s still very overtuned. However, I wanted to address a problem we saw after his rework thats happening again.\r\n\r\nHis passive is eating up too much of his power budget.\r\n\r\nWe saw this after his rework. His passive being so strong and limiting potential counterplay is going to lead to the rest of Malz&#039;s kit getting trashed again.\r\n\r\nIf we want Malz to stay an AP carry Midlaner, the passive has to go. I know a lot of people dont want this, but we&#039;ve  been here before and its going to happen again. His damage is going to get nerfed over and over again to balance out the rest of his kit. This is going to force him out of the mid lane role again.\r\n\r\nMalz is going to have to give up either damage or utility. I think giving up the utility of his passive is the best route to continue being a Midlaner. You don&#039;t have to like it, but you Malz players have already lived through the alternative. I think this is the best way to save him from Bot Lane.\r\n\r\n***tl;dr*** Instead of nerfing Malz&#039;s damage again, please consider doing something with his passive so his MIdlane viability isn&#039;t destroyed","replies":[{"poster":"Thresh Outta Fux","date":"2017-06-21T01:18:11.620+0000","up_votes":25,"down_votes":0,"body":"As an old Malz player;\n\nFuck that shield.","replies":[{"poster":"TwitchInMyPants","date":"2017-06-21T12:59:00.728+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Thresh Outta Fux,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=f63uEzBP,comment-id=000a,timestamp=2017-06-21T01:18:11.620+0000)\n>\n> As an old Malz player;\n> \n> Fuck that shield.\n\n^^^\n\nStarting with a Banshee's Veil at lv1 on a character that can hold people still to death is ridiculous.","replies":[{"poster":"Thefrostyviking","date":"2017-06-21T17:37:06.371+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But......if his passive is removed then my strategy to get free wins against any assassins with it + {{item:3802}} {{item:3102}}  rush will fail :(\n\nI have a 93% winrate with it. \n\n\n....\n\nIt might actually be slightly OP now that i really think about it.","replies":[{"poster":"KitSun9","date":"2017-06-21T23:45:00.994+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Slightly...

I really dislike this. This means malz is inherently MUCH better at kiting than chasing. It's really irritating due to point number 2.\n\n2) the voidlings have such low HP pools that at all stages of the game, they die from anything instantly.  I'm fine with autoattacks or turret shots killing them instantly, but currently any aoe ability or incident aoe from any teamfighting kills the voidlings instantly. Even a Janna tornado kills them instantly. Why even give them HP pools at this point? Even if you max them first, they die in one shot from any ability. Even at the final stages of the game. At all stages of the game they fall over from anything at all. Just make them instantly die if anything touches them. That is how they work basically right now. So you're not really getting anything out of the voidlings EXCEPT if you're kiting AND you have rylai's. They spawn, they start walking up, they usually die before hitting anything.\n\nThis means malz is absolutely pigeonholed into building rylai's every game. Even then, the voidlings are pretty junk. It's not that there is counterplay, it's that the voidlings get accidentally deleted no matter what during a teamfight. Theyre really just pretty useless right now. And it doesn't matter if you summon 1,2, or 3. They're dead usually before they AA anything.\n\nI'd much rather see them be a useful and interactive part of the kit. As it stands right now, all your damage comes from Q (poke and cc during teamfights) and R. Your E does damage, but its over time and its just not as effective as most midlaners core spells should be. It's ok, it slows, it's fluff. IDK you're not gonna kill anyone but a low HP squishy with it.\n\nTBH I'd love for the voidlings to be a core part of the damage, and the ult (suppress) be a cc for your voidlings and E to do the work. They were headed in the right direction. Where they are right now is relying on Q, R, and to a lesser extent E. You're only maxing E in lane for efficient waveclear and pressure/shove.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ClatoVerataNicto","date":"2017-06-21T02:41:29.778+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"His shield should be replaced.

It wasnt until the voidling nerfs (specifically they dont swarm) that he lost his ability to be a jungler in the first place. Right now his voidlings do no AD damage, so his AD variant (the one you would jungle with) isnt even viable because black cleaver was what made it work at all. \nThose sites dont show his jungle because he hasnt been jungle viable in a long time. Its not because he was NEVER a jungler.\nalso, reason he was chosen as support was because his kit had VERY low ability to kill people alone and his ultimate was VERY useful in the botlane for locking down priority targets for the ADC to kill. After the base stat nerfs and the voidling speed/range nerfs he was in a limbo where he couldnt do ANYTHING competitively. \n\nOne last thing...
