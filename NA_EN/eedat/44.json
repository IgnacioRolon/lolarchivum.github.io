W doesn't give enough shielding and regen to do anything, and it guarantees that you can't do enough damage to Leona's ADC to dissuade them from going in again. It also takes away from your ability to poke the Leona and her ADC out level 3-5, which is a huge part of the matchup.\n\nI don't care how aggressive the Leona is, I'm maxing Q. There is no situation where I wouldn't. Even we're losing hard, I wouldn't max W, because that just guarantees that we'll never be able to get a cross kill in a gank, and it means that I won't be able to do enough damage to roam effectively at 6 (and roaming at 6 or even before 6 is exactly what I'll do in a losing lane).\n\n>I think the problem is people pick stuff like Leona or Thresh into Sona thinking it's gonna be ezpz but really, you still have to play the lane way more aggressively than you might normally play it to really get an advantage over Sona.\n\nI kind of disagree. I actually think the problem is exactly the opposite: People pick Leona into Sona thinking they can win every trade, and as a result they go in literally all the time, and they play up on you thinking that the threat of an engage will make you back off. The thing is, Sona's heal and poke design is based around taking trades that are even slightly bad, and punishing them horribly, and she can actually resist getting bursted down thanks to her shield/heal. Pre-6, if Leona and her ADC don't get all of their burst off very quickly, Sona can turn it into a sustained trade that she and her ADC will almost always win. After 6, Leona's ults have to be followed up very quickly, and she has to go in while Sona isn't in a position to stun her ADC, or else Leona will lose most of her stun uptime and sunlight procs while her ADC is getting bursted. The impetus is on Leona to take only the best fights, and way too many people will just go 100% ham 100% of the time.\n\nEver since Sona got the shield added and had her base stats increased, I actually think that Leona really doesn't do great against Sona. If the matchup is played absolutely perfectly, Leona will win, but even small mistakes open her up for a ton of punishment. I will specifically pick Sona into Leona because of this.","replies":[{"poster":"Battlecast Sona","date":"2016-07-18T00:24:57.791+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you've died more than twice against Leona you should at least be putting a couple extra points in W (imo) just because it's unlikely at that point that the slight additional damage from Q will really matter. With Q getting nerfed and W getting buffed, I think people are kind of clinging to the Q max - most of the damage comes from powerchord (which was buffed and isn't based on Q level at all), so there's no reason to continue to max Q if you lose kill pressure, especially against a lane like Leona where if you have no kill pressure you're basically free.\n\nAnd while you are right about Leona needing to take the right fights, if Leona takes the right fight twice in a row Sona and her ADC basically automatically lose the lane.

It would literally instantly fix every single problem with Sona, because she's way less oppressive when you can actually engage on her without her just instantly stunning you and your ADC and walking away/killing both of you. It makes sense for someone like Janna to have a disengage ultimate - she can't really utilize the CC for herself aside from peeling for an ADC, because she doesn't have any sort of significant damage, and I feel she pays for it by having a bit less team utility than Sona.  The only reason we still have Crescendo is because Riot is afraid of alienating the Sona playerbase, but if you look back over Sona's patch history Crescendo is consistently listed as one of the reasons she's strong, even though it literally hasn't had a significant change since a range nerf in season 1.","replies":[{"poster":"Immortal spax","date":"2016-07-18T18:26:06.479+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can say that hard engage champs counters sona as much as you want, but facts are facts, and its a fact that i didnt even won a single 2v2 with leona against her.\n\n\nWell now you can say, \"you are just a silver scrub l2p noob\"\nBut scroll up and see, 59% winrate against leona, plat+\n\nAnd i dont think that 59% of leonas plat+ are boosted silvers.\n\n\nYou keep saying that sona doesnt needs number nerfs, but just rework ults, but you still dont understand that her ult is just the icing on the cake.\n\nHer kit is braindead, oppressive and overpowered.\n\nRiot now just needs to delete one of those 3 thing and balance the other 2, ez.","replies":[{"poster":"Battlecast Sona","date":"2016-07-18T18:34:48.511+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Her ult is the reason her kit is oppressive.

And I can tell you, if you're losing to Sona pre-level 6 you would've lost to Sona last patch too. \n\nHer numbers were **NERFED** on her damage this patch. **NERFED**. And her heal received a net nerf on low health targets (AND IT'S GETTING NERFED NEXT PATCH). All I'm saying is Riot has done this song and dance over, and over, and over. AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER. We've seen numbers nerf after numbers nerf after NUMBERS NERF after numbers nerf on Sona and it's literally never fixed her problems.\n\nYes, remove her oppressiveness and the braindeadness. Neither of those things will be fixed by flat damage nerfs, I'm telling you now. Because she's not oppressive because of the numbers on any of her abilities, and advocating further nerfs knowing that is ridiculous. I mean hell, her Q at level 5 does 220 damage if you hit with your AA as well - for reference, {{champion:267}} W at level 5 does 230 damage as well, potentially to two enemy targets (just like Sona's Q) AND it heals an allied champ at the same time for 185 health, AND it speeds up the allied target. Nami's W ratio is only .2 lower than the combined ratio on Sona's Q and autoattack. For reference a level 9 Sona has a 40HP heal and shield available to her. LOL.\n\nSona is a lategame support who right now carries too much early game threat because she has access to a very powerful disengage/engagement ult. Riot needs to find a way to line up that fantasy with Sona, and I really don't think reducing her damage numbers is really the issue.\n\nAdditionally, removing Sona's ultimate has a pretty huge effect on her in general - when Sona has no instant AoE stun, she can no longer really safely rush full AP. It becomes a lot more dangerous for Sona to go AP because she no longer has an oh shit button that can facilitate her either oneshotting someone or disengaging from a situation she should be dead in. This would fix a lot of Sona's numbers problems in the mid and lategame fairly easy by pushing her into more utility focused purchases like {{item:3190}} - when the champion becomes riskier to play, building AP becomes less useful (especially when, really, you're a support who shouldn't be prioritizing your own personal damage anyway, but rather your ability to keep your team alive).","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"ACENOX","date":"2016-07-18T10:27:05.190+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the real counter is abusing sona's base ms and base armor/hp by picking hard engage adc like {{champion:22}}","replies":[{"poster":"Immortal spax","date":"2016-07-18T10:47:02.953+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So she ult and go away, an adc ult for supp ult, still worth for sona and in 30 seconds she is again full health.\n\n\nMuch counter play.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"AHeroNamedHawke","date":"2016-07-18T09:29:40.606+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sona could literally have a 100% solo queue win rate, warp tournament play so much that the pick phase is altered to allow each team to pick Sona 3 times, and Sona mains would still come to G&B to defend her","replies":[{"poster":"Blåbæret","date":"2016-07-18T10:28:48.677+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Exactly.

I wish Riot would realize that so they could actually address the problem instead of just nerfing Sona over and over.","replies":[{"poster":"Immortal spax","date":"2016-07-18T18:09:32.173+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nice text, but she still needs a \"HERRR DERR NERRF\"\n\nThe fact she is braindead and oppressive is just a plus to my statement.\n\n\nAlso i agree her kit is exaggerated, no other champs heals, speeds up, does a ton of damage and have a big CC and plus is braindead.\n\nAlso count that sona have a lot of fangirls, thats why riot dont want to gut her like yorick.","replies":[{"poster":"Battlecast Sona","date":"2016-07-18T18:23:38.839+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You literally didn't read my post though. The reason she's oppressive isn't because she does damage (lots of supports do that, and better - {{champion:143}} comes to mind) or even that she also heals AND does damage AND speeds up ({{champion:267}} ) - it's that she does all of these things while also having an **instant cast AoE stun**. At least Zyra's knockup is delayed and close range. At least Nami's wave is really slow and easy to dodge.\n\nSona QWE by themselves are far from oppressive - if you think that's oppressive it must bother you to know that Soraka Q does more damage at all ranks and her heal is also better and lower CD (AND she has access to CC outside of her ultimate). The only problem with her base spells is the auto-target Q - the numbers on them are pathetic in comparison to every single other support in the game. This is literally the problem - people like you who say \"OH SHE'S BRAINDEAD NERF HER\". No, you don't NERF braindead champs, you make them not braindead. Flat numbers nerfs will NEVER, EVER fix Sona's problems, because she ALREADY has some of the lowest numbers on her base abilities and the damage on Crescendo is not the problem in her kit. It's like how GP was fluctuating wildly between being a powerfarming monsterbeast or worthless for a couple of season - they added complexity to his kit so they could have additional levers to balance that weren't just \"damage\". Sona really only has base numbers and CDs to change, and I feel like they've had everything from release Sona's incredibly, super short CDs starting at level 1 to initially post-rework the incredibly long CDs and it's never really fixed her problems.\n\nWhat frustrates me is that (for example), the values on the PBE nerf aren't even new heal values for Sona - it's just a revert to a previous patch. Like, if none of the numbers you've tried have worked and you've been trying for like 3 or 4 years now, maybe the numbers aren't the problem. Maybe flat nerfs won't fix this champion.","replies":[{"poster":"Immortal spax","date":"2016-07-18T18:35:30.083+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you think sona isnt oppressive in laning phase, its clear that you never played against an \"above the average\" sona.(im not going to say good, because there are no goof sonas)\n\nIn laning phase she is worst than karma top, she comes at you, Q, you try to give her back the poke, but she W and E, and like this for all the laning phase.\n\nA good nami can never do that, zyra can but she is too fragile.\n\n\nOne of the reason why for most people is ok that Azir can be OP its because he is difficult to play.\nOne of the azir counter plays is the azir itself, a bad player with a high skill cap champ can nevver have a 52% winrate with azir at the first 1-5 (check sona in champion.gg)\n\nNow, or we turn her numbers down(by a lot) or we remake her to be a high skill champ with an exaggerted damage.(for me its fine)","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
