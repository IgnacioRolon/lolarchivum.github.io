It's the feeling of uselessness if your ADC is bad which other roles don't really feel during all of laning phase and then, on top of that, being flamed. But like I said, supports can be bad too.

Champions with hard CC (a powerful one) engage, or general tankiness that is not hard to pull off, that are basically giant targets that cannot be mowed down easily are some of the most reliable in the game. {{champion:57}} is in a similar fashion of \"Proxy carry\" where it doesn't matter how badly you went in lane phase as long as your team can work self-sufficiently with you still being being a massive threat because of your tankiness, sustain, damage reduction, and hard CC. 20% damage reduction is insane later on. Or {{champion:18}} , who's damage and arguably entire kit is useful at any point in the game, packing CC, an AS steroid, AoE damage, and a large burst of damage to both champions AND towers.\n\noh btw. I get people can use him effectively, but even built tank, {{champion:33}} is just currently not enough to suffice unless it his midgame. otherwise, early on he's too squishy thanks to his cooldowns and mana and is easily harassed by ranged top-lane opponents. late game most Carries will have optimized against him, or simply mow him down before he becomes a problem ( {{champion:222}} or {{champion:96}} ) Best to either keep practicing in comps you know will work even if you're far behind, because his CC is still valuable, as is his taunt.\n\nthis helps work out that feeling of \"I'm useless\" or \"my jungler is useless\". Kinda hard to argue \"he did nothing\" when one unstoppable force can win an entire teamfight.\n\nSincerely: That one top lane player who would prefer you play a tank instead of Quinn or Teemo.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GrReaper96","date":"2016-09-01T03:45:36.010+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Jokes on you i play {{champion:61}} {{champion:53}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Maximum Morde","date":"2016-09-01T13:02:04.551+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm pretty sure everyone is a boosted animal and should just be demoted to b5","replies":[]}]}
