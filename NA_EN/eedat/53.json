His passive???? what is this? When you think of a yeti do you think of a super speed running and extra fast attack speed? TO me both his w and passive should be reworked into something more icy... \n\nLike his e could stun for 0.5-1.25 seconds, becoming a skillshots, his w could be a link from his breaths that you slow the enemy or boost your ally (like old karma w that everyone loved), his q same stuff but visually reworked into something similar to an icy chomp (trundle), his r same shit and his passive the weird stuff permanent that he already has for his q bitting, but on last hit only","replies":[{"poster":"AlienPrimate","date":"2017-07-02T10:13:40.278+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm getting kind of sick of targeted attacks being removed.

Rift Herald is an extremely binary objective that gives your team map pressure and gold with a single successful gank, and Nunu can solo it on spawn without taking much damage, leaving him more than ready to crush top lane right after with very little warning.\n\nThe main issue is that players are just flat out refusing to adapt to Rift Herald. If you see the enemy team pick Nunu, you should be prepared to collapse on him when he's taking objectives. You should run Teleport to deal with Herald. Honestly, you should do that anyway. The fact that Herald is obviously a powerful tool that if left unattended can give one team an insurmountable lead from very early on practically demands that you run Teleport, especially as a bot laner. \n\nNerfing Nunu's stats is fine, but until people actually start playing appropriately around Rift Herald then Nunu will continue to be a very powerful champion.\n\nOh, but his win rate has gone up recently.

Reason why he has a high win rate like Ivern is because he can build full support item making it practically 2 support for one ADC and helping with keeping enemy off the adc with slow. Stone born made him extremely better with the heal by autoing but he does have easy counters that being just get any champion that doesn't rely on auto attack speed and you automatically win. He can slow attack speed but he can't slow champion that rely on ability if you ask me what adc champion counter him that would be {{champion:119}} {{champion:51}} {{champion:202}}.\n\nPeople don't realize that building support item while going tank will actually carry because of adc but this depends if adc is not stupid to die in under 5 min and lose lane. Ivern is a better champion then Nunu to give heads up since Ivern can handle ability champion with shield and ult while Nunu really have a slow attack and movement speed.","replies":[{"poster":"Chembaron Yamada","date":"2017-07-02T19:59:26.934+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think that Jhin is really a counter against him.\nYes, he uses alot of abilities.
