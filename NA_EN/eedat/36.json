If you can properly play around this CD and mechanic of catching axes, Draven is much easier to deal with. \n\nBecause of the point above, Draven struggles **heavily** against reliable CC. Many supports can punish aggressive Dravens for catching axes in your face while trading, while others can prevent him from catching axes at all, simultaneously reducing his damage output greatly. \n\nHeavy sustain lanes, and greater range, can outsustain Draven's mana pool. Champions like Caitlyn, Jinx, and Ashe can trade well from a distance while typically all running Warlord's Bloodlust, forcing Draven to epend more mana during trades for mobility. These champions also have decent zone control, making harder to do Draven things.\n\nRemember, short trades (1-2 autos) will almost always be in Draven's favor, but extended trades/kiting will wear down any Draven. \n\nFinally, Draven has to get a kill to cash in on stacks. If you force extended laning while not handing over first blood, you completely negate the entire reason behind the Draven pick. \n\nHe has a good win rate but an extremely low pick rate (on NA, at least).

The complaints are too short sighted. Blind Pick in ranked had its problems, but with pick order there was at least some solution to the problem (even if it wasnt perfect). But there were ton of complaints about not having role selection in Ranked - when it was implemented, people complained that Secondary Supports and Fill got you support 99% of the time. So that complaint was addressed through autofill - but then autofill is the problem. \n\nIn this case, its the support. Earlygame bot pressure is most often determined by the support. Draven, though strong early, still falls under the ADC problem in lane - having to juggle CS, harass, and dodging abilities of 2 champions with only 1 potion. Strong harassing supports can punish a Draven and keep him in line for the early part of the game while he catches axes, get your ADC enough farm to buy items, then transition into teamfights where Draven's auto-attack reliant, single-target damage becomes a liability. But people complained about the strength of those supports like Brand or Zyra.
