Hate to be the bearer of bad news here folks. Can&#039;t run from the truth. \r\n\r\nADCs are part of the game. Get over it.

That is not the case at all and if you think thats what the forums are actually doing , idk get help.\n\nAs for the ADC threads. ADCs are a serious problem at all levels of play right now. Saying \"get over it\" is once again part of the opposite end of the extreme problem. People have created dozens of moderate threads , calmly discussing why they are a problem , what they are doing to opponents and offering potential solutions. People have had \"actual balance conversations\" for weeks on weeks about what should be changed and how. Seems like you ignored all of that and probably cherry picked a few instances to create this \"sky is falling\" thread. \n\nWhether random people like you ignore the threads or not , we dont care, what we do care about is that Riot is not responding or showing any ounce of communication, especially in regard to the champion twitch.

If League of Legends wants to balance the game around ADCs, fine so be it, but ADCs are not the only champions in this game, therefore focusing all your balancing efforts on a single class will always, absolutely 100% lead to an imbalanced state.\n\nIn my experience the most viable way to deal with an ADC is to have one person go after the support, removing their ability to protect the carry, while the other goes ape-shit all over the ADC's face.

This resulted in stupid high damage.\n\nThen they increased enchanter income and improved itemization in like one patch mid season 7. This resulted in very strong support protection.\n\nYou can't have both of those without it being a problem. However, I don't think you should automatically blame one round of support changes after two seasons of overtuned AD itemization. Support right now is totally fine if ADs have less-steep power curves. It's less fine when ADCs are assassinating people with at item.\n\n**EDIT:** I tried learning ADC this season, but I've mained Zyra and support champs for 3 seasons now. My use of the word \"assassinate\" is based on my experience playing Miss Fortune, returning to lane with Duskblade, bum-rushing the enemy ADC, and collecting gold after hitting QR.","replies":[]}]}
