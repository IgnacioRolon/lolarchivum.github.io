You don't lose relevance if you live and continue to deal damage. Rather then die. But I mean your lack of rank alone gives me a inkling of your mindframe, the \"DAMAGE DAMAGE DAMAGE\" thats all that matters. You prob just build pure glass cannon looking to get kills because kills are all that matter to you. Sometimes defensive item's increase your damage output because you actually live longer to deal more damage. Have you ever thought about that? That hmm maybe not dying in 1 second because you went full glass cannon is actually more viable? you could have 800 AP and have the ability to one shot someone or be a full item build adc that can right click someone twice but you just die in one shot so all that damage is literally wasted. Now if you had just a few defensive items weaved in to your build instead you'd be living longer in a fight there for dealing more damage overall.","replies":[{"poster":"Shade Of Wolf","date":"2017-02-13T22:05:02.792+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lack of rank? I was Plat 2 at one point brah.\nWe're talking about Zhonya's here, not in-game tactics, and it's a fact that it is a shell of what it once was, and was nerfed repeatedly because it was a viable offensive item due to stats, now it's been relegated to a pure defense niche item that sacrifices lane dominance because buying it is essentially committing to lategame, as I have said prior. you lose early and midgame relevance by not having the damage output in objective contest.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"breakordoom444","date":"2017-01-25T01:34:01.155+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Þśÿçhıç,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=AbbjuBnE,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2017-01-25T01:31:12.727+0000)\n>\n> They are countered by Zhonyas, Maw and steraks, barrier, heal and exhaust.

Her q and w are delayed and very easy to dodge and her stun is actually quite difficult to land early now that w has been reverted back to pre mid year mage update, its only easy when people dont respect her zone of control, she is also highly susceptible to divers and flanks.\nAlso Steraks and Maw work on literally any ad champion and zhonyas works on lkiterally every ap champion (it may not seem 'Optimal' but it is because it lets you live so its optimal). Exhaust and barrier work on every champion.
