Reward me for Good Play.","subforum":"General Discussion","up_votes":35,"down_votes":17,"body":"I don&#039;t know if I can quite pinpoint what&#039;s changed, but I really feel like I&#039;ve stopped finding good reasons to keep playing league. It&#039;s definitely not a gameplay thing, but it&#039;s all down to what that gameplay gets me. I&#039;ve spent the last 4 or five seasons as a jungle main and when mastery was added I decided I would play every champion in jungle up to mastery 5. When I started it was great. I played my favorite champions and got some of them up past that mastery. I&#039;m still working on it and I have only a handful of champions left, but it&#039;s made me realize that I have no reason to keep going after I finish this. I have nothing else that&#039;s driving me to play.\r\n\r\nI even stopped playing my best and favorite champs because they&#039;re maxed mastery. They don&#039;t get me anything. You might say wins, but wins get me nothing. Blue essence? What for the once a year emporium? Sure if the emporium had anything that actually felt like it was worth working towards. I&#039;m a warwick main and I don&#039;t even want to bother trying to get urfwick because of how tedius the BE system is. Nothing feels like, &quot;Yea I worked hard and earned this because of my skill!&quot;. The game doesn&#039;t care if I win or lose. I may be slower if I lose, but I&#039;m still sitting in the 50,000s despite spending tons of BE last emporium and spending most of the last 6 months working in backcountry conservation away from my computer.\r\n\r\nNow others might say ranked, but I don&#039;t just want a label that says I&#039;m of X ability. I don&#039;t want to be rewarded because I won. I want to be rewarded for my specific ability. The fact that I have so many baron steals under my belt, my pentakills, the times I&#039;ve perfectly body blocked deadly skillshots for my carries. I want to be rewarded for being me.\r\n\r\nI had a beautiful baron steal earlier today and yet I got nothing for it. I didn&#039;t even win because we were so far behind, but I feel like I should have. All that work and I got nothing. I have tons of clips of playing Warwick and landing those perfect q&#039;s to follow people as they flash out or using it to sidestep skillshots, but I get nothing for that. I get nothing for the actual skills I have only if those skills get me wins.\r\n\r\nIDK, maybe I&#039;m just nuts and tilted from a losing streak, but I really feel like Riot should look less at wins and losses and more how players win or lose.","replies":[]}
