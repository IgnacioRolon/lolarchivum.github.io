I don't even know why they made it so everyone can see who started the surrender vote.\n\nIf the surrender didn't go through, why should it even matter who voted in favor of it?  All it would do is enable people to be assholes, and everyone knows the LoL community is filled with assholes.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CharQueen","date":"2015-02-01T20:31:34.436+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"It would also help out for reports since many players who refuse to Surrender games are obvious trolls.\n\nNo one cares about 'LCS can turn 12/35 matches' when we're Silver 5.

I don't like surrendering unless the game is like 63/2.","replies":[{"poster":"InsaneSamurai","date":"2015-02-01T21:17:47.391+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can come back sometimes *if* the team actually tries to win and doesn't spend the extra few minutes arguing and trolling.  If you are playing with random people, they're generally arguing instead(and those cases knowing who said what wouln't change anything since they're trolling it out anyway). You just have to sit there and endure the arguing until the enemy finishes you off since Riot deemed any 2 denyers more worthy of existing than any 3 who want surrender.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CharQueen","date":"2015-02-01T20:54:40.283+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Yawn.
