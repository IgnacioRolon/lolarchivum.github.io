It wasn't intentional feeding, he was simply using his skillset differently than the players around him wanted him to, or understood.\n\nRiot has long stood for the argument that you should be ale to play whoever you want, wherever you want.  If you play that champ to the best of your abilities, it shouldn't be a bannable offense.  Suddenly they've flipped on it, because their new reports system is broken and relies on weight of reports and number of reports instead of having a real human element look at the reports.\n\nIt's Garbage and Riot needs to look into their practices.","replies":[{"poster":"Dominick Destine","date":"2016-11-16T20:27:11.778+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":8,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Ragnar42,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=rMYsJKTu,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2016-11-16T20:24:51.353+0000)\n>\n> Gotta define a trollpick though. \n\nPlaying to lose / suboptimal pick is trolling.
