Please try again in a few minutes. If the issue persists, contact Player Support\". So I went to login to the page it sent me to and it told me that I had the wrong password or something about the region and I know that's the right password. So I sent a report and they emailed me backing wanting proof that it's mine and I sent proof back that it is but its been about 19 hours and I am wondering what is wrong with my account? I think that it is hacked but I am not exactly sure. I ended up making this account to play for the time being but I want to play on my main since I have a ton of skins and all of my main champions. If someone could help me out I would appreciate it a ton! Thanks! P.S. The account name is **Squidyy17**\r\n{{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-03-17T22:15:18.065+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't worry!

I actually got CrunchyBonBon, he replies pretty quick but I'm confused about my account.. Does it mean that my account has been hacked? I'm confused on what is going on with my account. I just sent him proof that it is my account, what happens if that all goes through? Do I just change my password or? Sorry for all these questions just very confused and kinda scared because I put a little bit of my money into the account.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-03-18T03:01:28.909+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since you're currently in touch with our account specialists through a ticket, it'll be best to leave the rest up to them.
