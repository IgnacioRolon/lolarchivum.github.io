Before I bought it I had around 829 RP. With it being -50% off I should have been left with 342 RP. Instead, The purchase system thought I was buying it for full price, at 975, and has left me with -146 RP total.\r\n\r\nCould I get some help in fixing this? I'd hate to have to buy for RP just to kick myself outta the negatives.\r\n\r\n [ScreenShot of my Purchase history, showing that I now own the skin, and that it shows it said it was bought for 487..](http://puu.sh/lZopk/1ad5135656.png)\r\n\r\n[ScreenShot of the Challenger Ahri skin in the Champions page, showing I own it, and my negative RP balance. ](http://puu.sh/lZoFf/1c192ce594.png)\r\n\r\nAny assistance from Riot would be greatly appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"Hollymonster","date":"2015-12-17T23:49:46.560+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Try relogging.
