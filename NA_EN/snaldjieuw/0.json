I submitted a ticket on this account as well regarding my ticket on my other account on the Russian server. It has been 4 days since I submitted my first ticket and I still haven't got an answer so I'm wondering how long it will take for riot to answer my submission? Its really frustrating not even getting an answer or anything at all in as long as 4 days. usually I get answer within 24 hours from riot support but now it just feels like my ticket has been thrown down the trash bin. please respond and help me. My summoner name on the Russian server is Łoi.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-27T15:12:50.648+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We don't have visibility on Russian support, but if it's anything like our current volume, it's probably a bit higher with Worlds and other events going on currently.  Just make sure you don't keep replying to your ticket as that can get you to the bottom of the queue, until you hear back.  I know it's no excuse and the wait sucks, I'm sorry about that.  :(  All hands are on deck here, and we will reply back as soon as we can.  Hang tight!","replies":[{"poster":"snaldjieuw","date":"2017-09-27T15:38:47.804+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok thank you for the answer. are you sure that there isn't anything at all you can do to help me? since Ive been falsely banned so I'm restricted from my account which is pretty frustrating..
