Totally still getting that First Strike Lucian though.\n\nDoes this mean to get the other voice you have to get the skin during the First Strike promotion? Or is it going to be a toggle? Kinda confused and on the fence about blowing a ton of money on a free-to-play game...","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-09-01T19:54:00.699+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey JC DarkOmen,\n\nI'm not sure what you mean here. \n\nIf you're referring to First Strike, there is no change in voice. If you purchase these skins during the first week for full price, you'll receive a limited edition loading screen card. If you purchase the skins at the sale price (Yi will still be legendary price - 1820 RP), you won't receive the loading screen card. \n\nThe voices will be the same regardless of when you purchase the skin. All of these skins have voice processing. PROJECT: Yi actually has two types of processing - one when he's in a normal state, and one once he enters Highlander form.","replies":[{"poster":"JC DarkOmen","date":"2015-09-01T23:11:24.122+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok, yeah I listened to the Yi voice and generalized from there.

When in Highlander form, he actually seems to be moving quite slow. I know you guys don't alter gameplay numbers when making a skin, cause thats not your job, so, he would be moving just as fast as his base skin, but it \"appears\" he is moving slower than his base skin.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-09-01T20:42:23.569+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're right in that the gameplay numbers have changed. Do you think it may appear that way due to the orange rings that are moving around him when he's in Highlander?","replies":[{"poster":"Masked Lunatic","date":"2015-09-02T18:45:17.242+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It seems the animation speeds are what tends to make this so (if the animations were to be faster it would make him seem faster).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Electro522","date":"2015-09-01T21:17:07.499+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think it may be the lack of \"lines\" coming off of him. On his base, and every other skin, when in highlander, he has these lines coming off of him, making him look like he's moving at an incredible pace. Project: Yi doesn't have these, or at least they're not very noticeable. Instead, it looks like he prepares to move at such an incredible speed, but doesn't really.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"lightdragoon88","date":"2015-09-01T22:11:16.685+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And PROJECT: Yasuo when he does his taunt and joke.","replies":[]}]}]}
