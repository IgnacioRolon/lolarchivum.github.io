I'll keep that in mind next time I argue with that one old lady (she likes to argue) at the senior home. She does the exact. same. damn. thing. \n\nIf we were to follow through with your perception of things, I'd say you need to be more understanding of others, not they be more understanding of your theory.

However, \"kys\" has been around for awhile...it's pretty solidified. You're not going to simply take this one back.
