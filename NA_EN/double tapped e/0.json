Here we go:\n\n[The Razer Twisted Treeline Tournament](https://lol.gamepedia.com/Razer_Twisted_Treeline_Tournament)\n\nNice!

What I'm trying to say is, Riot says \"we did all this and that and nobody was interested\" when in reality, they didn't update the mode in response to community feedback the way they do with SR, they didn't promote a competitive scene so that players would be incentivized to take the mode seriously and practice it as an alternative to SR. They sat around for YEARS at a time doing NOTHING after the initial release of the mode, and are now blaming the community for our lack of interest.","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-09-06T02:04:18.605+0000","up_votes":23,"down_votes":4,"body":"Why does this list only include a specific type of patch, which seems to be map-wide small balance tweaks?

You actually did miss the _vast_ majority of the work Riot has put into TT, up to and including the total overhaul. You make absolutely no mention of that. In fact, you specifically state \"That is EVERY PATCH in the HISTORY OF THIS GAME that has specifically addressed issues related to Twisted Treeline.\" The overhaul specifically addressed issues related to TT (as did a _multitude_ of other patches), so that's simply not true in any way, shape, or form. I'm not sure why you're trying to defend TT when you obviously know so little about it. It's like Dilbert's Pointy-Haired Boss trying to save squids by cutting down on ink usage.\n\nhttps://assets.amuniversal.com/c5e433a09dfd012f2fe500163e41dd5b","replies":[{"poster":"DOUBLE TAPPED E","date":"2019-09-06T03:46:44.204+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":5,"body":"https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Twisted_Treeline\n\nScroll down to patch history.\n\nIf you want to prove me wrong then you can go through every patch in the game YOURSELF and find every instance of a slight change to TT.

This is, in fact, backwards, confusing cause and effect: the real reason that Riot stopped supporting TT was that it failed to bring in players. The investment of resources petered out once it became clear that those resources were being wasted on a mode no one played. Now that it's being removed, people just want to be hipsters pretending that they liked or might have liked it, when they clearly never had any interest in it. In a couple years, when more recent players ask about TT, these whiners will wax poetic about how TT was just SO MUCH FUN and they played it all the time with all their friends and everyone loved it and Rito James removed it for no good reason.","replies":[{"poster":"Minarde","date":"2019-09-07T04:03:24.380+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I didn't misread his premise, and OP isn't the one confusing cause and effect.

RNG. What did TT ever have that was unique? Altars? That's barely a reason to be immersed in it. We can't even bring Vilemaw in this equation.\n\nARAM survived specifically because it was made for fun, to relax. It survived all those years, and then Riot decided that they're going going to host an event, updates every now and then etc. And, iirc, ARAM did have its map changed, though it was a long time ago? I'm not 100% sure on that.\n\n\n> they enjoy the game at it's core despite it's flaws.\n\n\nFlaws? Not just flaws. They made the game flawed right down to its core, and then said \"fuck it we're leaving\". Who in the WORLD would want to play TT for fun? After the years of not getting one SINGULAR update? When half the champions in that game are busted as fuck and you get oneshot? Who would REALLY want to play League with content that was 3-4 seasons ago?","replies":[{"poster":"T2K Baka","date":"2019-09-06T14:19:30.808+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What about dominion, why the fuck was that removed.

The most probable reason I can think of is because it was a balance nightmare and did not generate money. The gaming industry is hardly about passion anymore, it's about the piles of cash they can accumulate. This, I'm afraid, is also one of the reasons why TT will be removed.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"True Garen","date":"2019-09-07T05:20:01.392+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Academy Kayn,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=5PoNfKfk,comment-id=00010000000000000001,timestamp=2019-09-06T04:27:23.996+0000)\n>\n> \"It's just a meme mode\" doesn't matter.

Just saying, it's at the bottom of the list, doesn't justify elimination. 3v3 players may be a scant fraction of the total, but they still far outnumber the total playerbase of many other games, on other servers, that manage to survive.

ARAM had random champ selection right? Unique to League. There is a new spell. Different. The whole thing is different. People were playing to relax from ranked and some just stuck with it. Because it was Unique.\n\nWhat did TT have? Unique items? ARAM had that as well. The only unique thing TT EVER had was the altars, but that shouldn't be a reason to immerse yourself into a whole new gamemode. The different map TT had wasn't really such a big thing. We had gamemodes with different maps before.\n\nSo now, how COULD TT fail after Riot did not give a flying fuck about its queues?
