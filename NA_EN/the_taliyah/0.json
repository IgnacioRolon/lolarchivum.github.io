As seen in the video I linked, the champion loadout screen attempts to load but crashes every single time. Please help!\n\nUPDATE: It turns out the problem is Curse related, I've since closed the Curse application and my game hasn't crashed since. Since Curse is self-updating it must've introduced a major bug to mac users that play League. Looks like it's Discord for now!

It happened JUST this month (March 2017) actually. I do think it might be a Curse issue because I can run League perfectly fine when it's not running along side it.  And you might be right that it could be bugging out mac users because all my friends who don't use mac have no problems what so ever. It's a little frustrating because I only really play league with friends and Curse with them when we do so, so this bugsplat happening really hinders my playing time with them haha.
