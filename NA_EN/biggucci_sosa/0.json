I have noted that the support banner indicating that the delivery was still in process has been deleted, thus, I'll probably send a support ticket to see what was the problem. I'll also mention that the rest of the times I was entitled to a gift by Riot, I had to ask for it in a support ticket after the delivery time expired. They kindly provided me with it without issues, but makes me wonder if there are some problems to reach certain people accounts in the gifting procedure.","replies":[]},{"poster":"gafour","date":"2016-09-30T20:13:47.508+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I didn't receive it neither and the Riot post saying \" skins are still being sent out \" got deleted I'll call the support tomorrow but hope We could get help from an Admin","replies":[]}]}
