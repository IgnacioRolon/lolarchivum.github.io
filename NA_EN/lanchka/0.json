Since talking with friends I looked at the model in game and realized it's pretty decent, especially for not getting Victorious. I got it for 20% off and was wondering if that discount merges with the discounted sale price happening around the 20th. 70% off sounds fabulous, but if not, what discount will I get? Important questions, I know :P Thanks in advance :D","replies":[{"poster":"Son Golin","date":"2015-12-18T23:17:11.795+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Lanchka,\n\nThere is a chance that you'll see a skin that is on sale in both the standard Store and in your Snowdown Shop. The two stores are separate and the discounts do not stack. WizardCrab--in this [thread](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/uQERzEsh-challenger-ahri-storms-back-into-snowdown)--also pointed out that any skin in your Snowdown Shop cannot be purchased if it is on sale within the standard Store.\n\nI hope that answers your question!","replies":[{"poster":"Lanchka","date":"2015-12-18T23:40:47.625+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks! I missed that one so that clears stuff up for me ^_^ I guess the no-stacking makes sense cuz if you got a 50% off or higher you would get it for free... lol. Have a nice holiday season!","replies":[]}]}]}
