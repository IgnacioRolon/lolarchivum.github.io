{"poster":"sdsdfdf","date":"2016-09-09T17:03:47.379+0000","title":"Don't revert the Kog'maw rework","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":7,"down_votes":13,"body":"It just perfectly fits his niche of &quot;immobile late game hypercarry&quot;, and he actually has a really high skill ceiling (z+x kiting, hard early, w timing) while still being kinda easy for begginers. I get it that he is OP atm and the on-hit build makes his mid-game too strong (A late game hypercarry SHOULD NOT kill a whole team with 2 items), but this can be fixed. A change i can think of would be to GUT his attack speed growth stat, while adding a new effect to his ult that that gives him a LITTLE bit of stacking atk. speed when it hits champions/epic monsters and it would also give him more atk. speed the lower hp the ulted enemy has. Imo this would be a nerf overall as he wouldnt be able to brainlessly stand and do tons of damage just with autos, but it would improve his hyper-carry niche while adding more depth, windows of power and skill to his gameplay. Altough he is a bit too strong as of now and needs a decent nerf, imo the rework was succesful and shouldn&#039;t be reverted. If u wanna revert some reworks, see Malzahar and Mordekaiser, not my Kogmaw amirite?
