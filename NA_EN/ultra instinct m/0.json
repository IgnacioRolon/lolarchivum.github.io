(I just looked at Rogue an I see he digs), but whatever you can I think the walk is wanky\r\n\r\nIf not let him hover instead of walking, cause if he can fly (which he does in his recall) why have such wanky walk. \r\n\r\nBut if he the walk cant be removed, have it turned down a bit on how hard he swings his shoulder","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2017-10-25T17:18:52.812+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi hi! \n\nPlease use the PBE boards to discuss anything that's currently being tested on PBE.
