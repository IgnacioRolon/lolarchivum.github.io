He does his best work, IN THE JUNGLE. \r\n\r\nNext thing you know its &quot;Hmm, adc&#039;s ability scaling off ad ties them too much to bot lane, so we are gonna make all their abilities scale off magic instead&quot; or &quot;Hmm tanks are too tanky, lets make them utility supports that are squishy so they are not tied down to their role&quot; \r\n\r\nNow that my rant is done, a stronger Q is pretty good but that W damage was to help clear a little better in the grouped camps. Seems like riot just likes nerfing khazix in some form or other. granted his Q will be destroying people but he already did that. why not make W worth something? no one ever evolves W, let that sink in (except when they win the quest to get that final evolution)","replies":[{"poster":"C9 Squeeky ","date":"2018-03-22T01:38:35.374+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"...","replies":[]},{"poster":"paisy","date":"2018-03-21T23:05:26.378+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kha has been meta for a while, he could use a nerf","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-03-21T21:18:40.788+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Next thing you know its \"Hmm, adc's ability scaling off ad ties them too much to bot lane, so we are gonna make all their abilities scale off magic instead\" or \"Hmm tanks are too tanky, lets make them utility supports that are squishy so they are not tied down to their role\" \n\nThat is a completely crippled leap of logic. He is getting a buff to allow some more versatility and will still be just fine as a jungler.\n\nRemember when people (probably ones like you) cried endlessly because riot was only releasing champions that could fill one roll and lane?\n\nWhy is it so bad to give additional options? It wont hurt his jungling ability, at least any more than he deserves.","replies":[{"poster":"ScorcherElf","date":"2018-03-21T21:51:26.361+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"he cant lane as well as most other junglers. you got xin, rengar, jarvan, ekko, wukong. they can lane AND jungle just fine. when is the last time you ever saw a khazix in a lane? About as often as a champ is completely alone in their lane. also, most any champ being in a lane can squash khazix like the literal bug he is, sion just get tankier, riven just does riven things, yasuo blah, brand, xerath, ryze (LOL). \n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}}","replies":[]}]}]}
