Do me a favor and run a quick traceroute to the EUW servers at 185.40.65.1 and post the results here so I can take a look.\n\nIn the meantime, double check your network settings like port forwarding and DNS settings to ensure you get a solid connection in case packet loss isn't the real problem here.","replies":[{"poster":"DREFON","date":"2017-11-27T19:49:28.760+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Screenshot Here: [Screenshot](https://i.gyazo.com/2e5cb7e05b6933abf42219354d6cc69e.png)\n\nText Here:\n\nTracing route to 185.40.65.1 over a maximum of 30 hops\n\n  1    <1 ms    <1 ms    <1 ms  NOSDRIVE [192.168.1.1]\n  2     9 ms     6 ms     5 ms  10.11.191.254\n  3     7 ms    15 ms     6 ms  10.137.218.17\n  4    37 ms    36 ms    37 ms  10.255.51.34\n  5     *       39 ms    38 ms  riot-games.baja.espanix.net [193.149.1.32]\n  6     *        *        *     Request timed out.\n  7     *        *        *     Request timed out.\n  8     *        *        *     Request timed out.\n  9     *        *        *     Request timed out.\n 10     *        *        *     Request timed out.\n 11     *        *        *     Request timed out.\n 12     *        *        *     Request timed out.\n 13     *        *        *     Request timed out.\n 14     *        *        *     Request timed out.\n 15     *        *        *     Request timed out.\n 16     *        *        *     Request timed out.\n 17     *        *        *     Request timed out.\n 18     *        *        *     Request timed out.\n 19     *        *        *     Request timed out.\n 20     *        *        *     Request timed out.\n 21     *        *        *     Request timed out.\n 22     *        *        *     Request timed out.\n 23     *        *        *     Request timed out.\n 24     *        *        *     Request timed out.\n 25     *        *        *     Request timed out.\n 26     *        *        *     Request timed out.\n 27     *        *        *     Request timed out.\n 28     *        *        *     Request timed out.\n 29     *        *        *     Request timed out.\n 30     *        *        *     Request timed out.\n\nTrace complete.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-27T21:11:42.317+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea all those timeouts are where your connection is getting stuck.
