Go to load into a ranked game and all I get is Windows telling me that LoL has crashed. Try to restart the machine quickly and relaunch the game with ye olde \"Did you turn it off and back on again?\" to no avail, still gave me the same issue. Launcher is fine, press \"reconnect\" and I get nothing. This wasn't happening to me yesterday when I was playing ARAM. The fixes I found from a google search were that Lolreplays wasn't playing nice, or that other extensions weren't playing nice. I don't have any other extensions, and I don't particularly want to redownload the game on my college's WiFi. \n\nIf you need any other information, I'll be more than happy to oblige.\n\nEdit: After a bit of trying... The same thing happens on every single map, across 2 accounts. Would love if someone had a fix for this. It was working not 12 hours ago.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-16T17:22:57.166+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know you've tried quite a bit of stuff, and I'd like to help.  When the game begins to load, what do you see?  Does the loading screen come up at all?  Is it a black screen?  Is the error a bugsplat, or specifically that it crashed?  Are you able to try another network by chance?  These answers can help a lot towards determining an issue with your game files and settings, or your campus connection.  Let me know.","replies":[{"poster":"MahTiggaz","date":"2016-12-16T18:27:52.285+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not the OP, but I am having a similar issue. Whenever I try to connect to a game (starting today) I cannot get to the loading screen. I get a bugsplat error every time. The first game of the morning never even went to the loading screen, it just said \"game still in progress\" and would never let me connect. What would you say the best remedy is for this problem? Full re-install?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-16T18:50:46.851+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A bugsplat is a different situation, because it's not actually a connection problem.  In these cases your game might be failing to render due to game files, drivers, or even hardware.  For your specific issue, go over the [game crash](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes+) guide for a fix.

The first time was in a ranked game so i lost lp, and i got 20 min low priority, but i didnt think much of it, so i reinstalled the whole game thinking it would be fine, i played all 5 of my low priority games without the problem happening again, today(the very next day) it happened again, and i got low priority, and lost even more lp that time.\nI get through champ selecr with no issues, but righr after that, it loads to a black screen for a split second, and returns with a bugsplat, and does the same thing every single time i try to reconnect. \nI really dont want to reinstall again, just to end up playing more low priority games and  have it happen again some other time. Please help.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Genthug","date":"2016-12-16T17:26:35.587+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It gets into the loading screen, the most that I've seen was my profile come up, ping is there, 0% and then it immediately crashed. Otherwise, the most I usually made it to would be with all of the champions blacked out. Windows error, not a bugsplat. Tried both Ethernet and two different WiFi connections from my college, all three didn't work.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-16T17:42:28.807+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Based on these details, it's very possible that a network problem or poor connection is preventing you from holding a steady connection and leaving you behind.  You'll want to go through each step of the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to tune up any local issues.  There is a possibility that your campus connection can be causing some of these issues, but it's important to tune up your side of things first to rule out possibilities.

I updated to the new client today as I was having the same issue today that a was yesterday. Yesterday, updating Java fixed my issue for me. Today, the issue is back again. And I've found that if I attempt to reconnect to a game, I can get into the game in the \"background\", FPS not being limited. I'm getting over 200+ FPS, I can see everything on the map, I have fully reloaded back into the game. As soon as I try to bring that screen to the front, it crashes the game. Does that change anything?","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
