It is completely wrong and immoral but they get away with it because they have ridiculous terms and conditions no one reads and everyone clicks on. One day someone with money (not me i wasted mine on this game) will sue them over their terms and conditions enabling them to lock people out of this money and Riot will lose. That is why credit card companies and paypal allow Charge Backs to be performed because you purchase a virtual item and are then not allowed access to it. Cant wait to see the day","replies":[]}
