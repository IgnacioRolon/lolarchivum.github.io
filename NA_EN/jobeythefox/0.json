Everything was going well until it stopped Applying Patches and is stuck at 77%. It was getting great 3000+ kbs before this, but now its just gone down. I have tried switching to 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4 Publics DNS's, switching to a wired connection, repatch, and reinstalling the launcher multiple times but it still  has not done anything. It has been at 77% for the past 4 hours, and I don't know what to do. This is the 6.24 patch.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-21T18:46:41.389+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you're getting stuck at 77% then something with your network may indeed be blocking you from staying connected to the patching servers.  The troubleshooting steps you've taken in this case are on the right track, but I suggest going over each step of the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to cover everything.  I hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
