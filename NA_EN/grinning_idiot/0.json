Magic weakens his craft, it is what is blamed for making the prison of the howling abyss flawed, allowing the void to slowly escape it. For all his disapproval of magic it is pretty obvious that Ornn is tied to elemental magic, just like his siblings Anivia and Volibear. \r\n\r\nMaybe it could be argued that he is a non-magical embodiment of an element. But I am not sure that is possible in runeterra where all elemental powers seem to be inherently magical; Taliyah, Iceborn, even Zyra (possibly) etc. \r\n\r\nIt was mentioned in a discussion about the new Ashe comic that there may be other elementally empowered freljordian&#039;s; like stormborn or hearthborn. This increases the tie between the freljordian demigods and elemental MAGIC.\r\n\r\nI wonder how Ornn would view a hearthborn? He liked the hearthblood because they also eschewed magic.","replies":[{"poster":"ZackTheWaffleMan","date":"2019-01-08T18:09:44.223+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Considering he's a demigod, he's probably magical in nature","replies":[{"poster":"WAAARGHbobo","date":"2019-01-09T05:19:03.733+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"He is magical in nature (at least half)-- and he makes magical things.
