Void corruption is **not necessary** in becoming a Darkin, the main difference between a Darkin and and Ascended is that, the Darkin are now sealed within weapons. Likely, most Darkin also meddled in blood magic and other dark magic, however if Nasus and Renekton were sealed within their weapons like Aatrox and Rhaast they would have also been considered Darkin. Few of the Darkin were corrupted by the Void to the extent of say Malzahar, eg.

I mean, the story was well written, yes, but the actual content and implications for the world at large homogenized a lot of things and made the Darkin trite, and also degraded the lore around Xerath, Azir, Nasus, and Renekton by tying their creation to Targon and also giving them colossally fatal flaws that they will inevitably become some kind of Darkin once they have any interaction with the now sprawling infestation of the Void that is popping up all over the world.\n\nAs for Lissandra, she no longer has the capability to use True Ice in her new lore. I don't know how they're explaining that now, but it's very clear she's unable to make it, considering she's now hoarding true ice weapons (instead of making them herself) and having panic attacks as she sleeps when the Watchers grow closer to escaping (as opposed to simply resealing them each year).\nHer lore is ALSO a bitter point for me, because it is such a confusing, horrible mess that took away the strength and power Lissandra had as a villain and degrades her to some Billy Bob hoarding ammo in a concrete bunker for when the lizard people come back to take revenge on him. Her new lore is a hot, hot mess that completely ruined her characterization as the woman who had plans we didn't even know about.\nHer lore is an instance of Riot erasing the \"unknown\" elements from the lore and over-explaining again, just like they did with the Darkin.","replies":[{"poster":"Grinning Idiot","date":"2018-10-15T19:57:05.429+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I can see where you are coming from.

We're not really given a Lissandra who has plans, who knows how they're going to turn out, and who's in it for the long haul.

Maybe her lore wasn't going anywhere, but the way she was portrayed made that not matter, since _she_ had control, and _she_ knew what was going well and what wasn't, and it was just a very perfect way to make mystery work for a character. Sometimes, one note characters like her, and Nautilus, need to be in the game, because simplicity sells a story in terms of what you don't know more so than having everything over explained to you.  As HP Lovecraft has pointed out, loose ends, not knowing, and the unknown can truly make stories and characters work, because it sparks the imagination and lets it wander and make it's own connections. I think League lore had some of that, but they're now relying too heavily on explanations and looping too many things into other concepts, which will lead back to another \"Institute of War\" problem in that they'll explain away all their loose ends and be forced to come up with ways of forcing all the characters to work with a story telling structure that's too rigid and too tightly explained to allow for expansion.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Ætheist","date":"2018-10-18T07:26:10.484+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Oleandervine,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=5xcsNgao,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2018-10-15T17:52:11.389+0000)\n>\n> I much preferred when the Darkin were an unknown alien force from outside the world threatening invasion and extermination of the humans. \n\nSo rather than the Darkin having a tie-in to the Void, you wanted them to just be a second Void?

Unknown alien force threatening invasion, whose members hunger for something humans can provide. \n> \n> Yeah, the Void&#x27;s recurring theme is hunger, which manifests in the Darkin as well by their drive to consume their hosts for form and power.\n\nI would absolutely rather the Darkin have no ties to the Void, because they are _NOT_ the Void in any sense. Where the Void is a mostly mindless creep that seeks to consume, the Darkin (in Varus' lore update on them last year) were an invading, fully aware, sentient species who were willing to subjugate Runeterra in combat in order to get the resources they wanted. They never \"hungered\" like you're talking about - they simply wanted the rich supplies of magical energy in the world. Comparing the old Darkin to the void is like comparing mold in your floorboards to the Roman armies that conquered most of Europe. \n\nAnd the Void's theme is hunger, yes, but the Darkin's theme was not - it was warmongering aliens who were a threat to ALL people. They were trapped in weapons, but they didn't hunger, they wanted their freedom and revenge, so they sought to overthrow the host who picked up the weapons so they could manifest again and exact that vengeance on the world who trapped them in weapons and shut them off from their homeworld. You are making some very long reaches to say that the Darkin and the Void were the same thing, and they really were not.\n\nWhat they WERE was a enemy who was new to the world, and would have enriched it in a new way by providing a clever, common foe for the people of Runeterra to join together and fight against. It also had the potential to introduce new Darkin in the future, because if they had a home that was sealed, it could very easily be unsealed, and it would have be a constant concern if anyone thought to open it back up again. There was a lot of potential in an alien force that was introducing new types of magic and warfare to the people of the world, and there was a lot of potential to do interesting things with them - but instead, Riot shoehorned them into Shuriman/Targonian/Void lore and tied up any potential loose ends very neatly. They overexplained the Darkin to the point where they didn't have any flexibility for the future with them, and they also put themselves in a weird spot of needing to explain why former Shuriman gods exhibited all of these bizarre powers no other Ascended or Aspects have exhibited. Overall, it looped the lore in on itself and removed the interesting arcs they could have told with the future and dangerous risk that the world of the Darkin posed, even in exile.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"DarkSoul1994","date":"2018-10-16T08:33:30.565+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1.
