Anivia's ult, for example. You want to place it precisely sometimes, but a lot of other times you just want to drop it at max range to EQ someone and end up walking because you're slightly out of max range.

Also it will most likely help increase the accuracy of the Q-E combo because in short, when you do the combo it feels like a linear skill shot in the direction of your cursor. So in retrospect using the combo while your cursor is  out of spell range would be helpful, since it would be hovering over the enemy champ.\n\nI think it would be better if you could make a new casting option that let's you cast spells at max range than making your champ move in order to do it. Prime example is {{champion:9}} Crowstorm, in which many mains have screamed for this feature. I think making a new casting feature as an add on to smart cast would be nice.\n\nEdit: I do prefer accuracy over anything however, which is why this option should be implemented rather than made for specific champion spells.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Attysu The Poro","date":"2015-08-17T00:41:00.497+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RiotRepertoir,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=fT2jJwaE,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-08-17T00:32:54.770+0000)\n>\n> I'd have to ask Meddler about this (he's the guy that made Syndra and knows the most about her), but there's probably a reason we do this.

Having soldiers spawn at max range instead of Azir walking forward to cast where I wanted them to spawn was incredibly frustrating, especially when I was auto-attacking a tower and then cast W on it only for a soldier to spawn instead because apparently I was a centimeter too far away, so annoying (tbh if you could change Azir W so that it functions like Syndra's Q I would be very happy and would give him another go ^_^ ).\n\nAlso correct me if i'm wrong but doesn't a Q->E combo send the orb to the same max distance regardless of how close it is to Syndra thus making the main reason the OP gave for this change redundant?","replies":[{"poster":"Slamurai Jack","date":"2015-08-17T12:51:14.524+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not necessarily.

The usability issue is that if i'm not in range the spell is no longer doing what I want anymore, it's casting the spell but not as I intended and putting the ball in a location I did not want.\n\nThere's also the case that I often use the current functionality as a sort of attack move. eg: enemy is running from me so I cast Q where they're heading to try and hit them with it, if that location is out of range Syndra will continue to move towards the enemy while I continually recast towards the enemies new location until I properly get in range and it is cast. With this new system I will have to move towards them during the chase and hope/guess when i'm in range before I cast Q otherwise it will just sloppily cast at max range and probably miss the target completely.\n\nThe issue I see is that proponents of this change are only thinking of the Q->E combo and not of Q as an individual spell. This type of change is fine and needed for skillshots like Ziggs Q and Javelin, etc... but the fact is that Q->E is not the spell, Q AND E are the spells and their usability should not be compromised to make their interaction a little better for certain players.","replies":[{"poster":"Slamurai Jack","date":"2015-08-18T13:35:38.243+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That argument doesn't make any sense to me.

I miss at least 1 long range stun every single game I play Syndra where I would hit it if the game would just let me cast my Q. Only allowing you to cast Q within it's range would make sense if it were a standalone spell, but given how it's tied so inextricably to her stun, keeping it the way it is seems really archaic. I've heard Ziggs Bouncing Bomb used to be the same way, and that sounds absolutely infuriating to me. Hell, Fiddles ult still works that way and I constantly see Fiddles barely walk out of a bush before ulting because they pressed R slightly outside their range.

The Q and E interaction is important but it is NOT the spell. Q and E are the spells, very much separate spells, and as I said elsewhere they need to be individually functional first and foremost.\n\nI understand where you're coming from. Ziggs Q used to be frustrating to me too, other champs like Rivens R did the same for a long time, it was was rage inducing, I luckily was able to even get the designer of Heimers rework (well the guy who ended up tidying it up and releasing it) to change his ulti grenade to cast without him walking into range but the problem is that these are all individual spells, not spell combos. Yes if you only want to spam Q/E as if it was a single spell this change would make heaps of sense but as i've said time and time again they are not a single spell, they are two separate spells that interact, and it's far more important that they be functional individually than in combination (though that implies Q->E isn't functional as is which is far from true).","replies":[{"poster":"Slamurai Jack","date":"2015-08-19T10:04:50.198+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You still haven't really explained to me how keeping it the way it is improves Q's functionality and precision.

That sounds like a very dangerous and sloppy way to cast the spell, and like I said before, likely you get you killed. Having the game move you into range in order to cast your spell does technically increase the precision of the spell, but it also decreases your precision at controlling your own champion, as well as decreasing both the precision and fluidity of her Q->E combo.

My interpretation was that you were suggesting they add in a range indicator *while* implementing the change to his Q to auto-cast at max range, which would be a problem.\n\nI was trying to explain why it wouldn't be okay to implement that change, even with the range indicator.\n\nIt would be cool if we could get a Q range indicator that always displayed to the Karthus player only, similar to what Rengar has in his kit.

However, it'd definitely be a sweet little QoL change with very few negatives. Karthus Q works differently from that of Syndra, mostly because of the synergy with her other abilities.

See below for the exact suggestion (or read OP's post).\n\nThank you so much for reading the post. If you pitched this changed it would mean so much.\n\nAnyways my logic is that if you use smartcasting (without range indicators) you probably have a good feel for the abilities range. I would much rather have my stun be reliable then have the \"precision\" of the way it works now. Getting off a stun can be a game changing moment. I have had many teamfights completely turned because the Q wouldn't go off for a Q-E combo which would've stunned a priority target.\n\nBasically, Anonagon put it very well\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Anonagon,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=fT2jJwaE,comment-id=00000004,timestamp=2015-08-17T02:17:44.146+0000)\n>\n> Syndra's Q doesn't require the precision that Karthus' Q does, and Syndra's other abilities are reliant on having Q out, so having a Q come out when you want it to is often more important than actually landing the Q itself.\n\nPlease pitch this idea to Meddler or whoever you have to. At least try it on PBE and get feedback, or add an entire option to make all spells behave this way.","replies":[]},{"poster":"yukumari","date":"2015-08-17T02:02:57.716+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The Homie Repertoir.
