However his lol account got hacked last year and the guy who hacked it botted, i guess as it only played aram games and lost. This all happened whilst he was on vacation so he was unable to fix it until it was too late, so when he came back his account was banned and he couldn't retrieve it as he couldn't remember the answers to the security questions and it generally seemed as though the riot employee was kind of just brushing him off. (this happened around 10 months ago, so about march last year).\r\n\r\nHe has made his peace with not getting the account back but he was wondering whether he could get his skins transferred to his new account. (or maybe someone could have a real look at what went on with his account, like checking the IP address of the botter to prove it wasn't him who was hacking). i would really just appreciate a detailed response as to what happened and whether anything can be done.","replies":[{"poster":"YoiNeko","date":"2017-01-28T02:01:54.418+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you i will let him know.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-27T17:38:08.532+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We aren't able to provide transfers of content between accounts, but we can continue helping out your friend.  Even if recovery fails, there's nothing wrong with trying again.  Our account recovery team will only restore account access if they are absolutely sure it's being returned to the owner, so it's okay if it doesn't pass the first time around.  I hope he'll try again, and wish him the best of luck!","replies":[]}]}
