(know that before I got the error message I had no Disconnecting problems) So the first few games after the re download I had ping up to 500+ all day, and I kept \"Attempting to Reconnect\". The next day logged on and saw I had 58 ping while a game was loading. I thought my problem was finally over but no.... the first 14 seconds into the game Im \"Attempting to Reconnect\" with 60 ping? I remember while re downloading it usually ask me to put in the administration password like 4 times. I remember putting it only once or twice then forgetting to sign the other two. When i came back 30 minutes later it was already on the \"Wizard Setup Finish\" http://www.wikihow.com/Install-League-of-Legends#/Image:Install-League-of-Legends-Step-10.jpg\r\nIt acted as if I already put in the two other passwords, but I know for SURE that I didn't. Maybe it was because of that, i don't know. Im Sorry if this is confusing to understand Im not the best at explaining if it's not clear just tell me , please try your best to help me im tired of  \"Attempting to Reconnect\" all the time!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-13T22:33:02.627+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"An administration password isn't a normal prompt unless it's due to a setting with your OS.  Regardless, it shouldn't be an issue if you're able to get passed the patcher and into the game.  It sounds like you are having a series of issues though ranging from network to potentially corrupt game files.
