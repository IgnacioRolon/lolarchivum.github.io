Yet as I sit here and watch the games between TSM and C9 from earlier today, I see the sad amount of fans in the stands and I can&#039;t help but remember the INSANE amount of fans that filled the expo hall at the Washington State Convention Center last summer. I realize they want to branch out, but they also screwed over Pacific Northwest fans by revoking OUR opportunity to watch the NA teams represent.  \r\n\r\nDoes anyone else feel my pain?","replies":[{"poster":"Vixanys","date":"2015-04-21T17:34:11.201+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While I do miss these events, riot has evolved to not needing a separate convention to host them. They still have IEMs. Which is nice.\n\nBut now we get LCS splits, Wild Card Invitationals, Mid Season Invitationals, Worlds and All Stars.","replies":[]}]}
