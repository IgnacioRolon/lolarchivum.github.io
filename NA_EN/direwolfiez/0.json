Every thread that discusses possible Nid changes (be they productive discussions or just QQ threads) in GD is getting closed.  The only official statement about Nid's current state was Morello's posts in this thread: (http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=4378367), which made vague statements about how Nid's current playstyle may or may not be slightly toxic, but said nothing about possible changes Riot is looking at besides a possible cooldown increase to her Q.  The PBE has no tentative Nid changes at all.  While some people have legitimate arguments as to why Nid should be changed, I will admit, most of the threads and posts about her are just players raging after getting stomped by a Nidalee.  Even so, I saw several productive threads that were discussing possible Nid changes get shut down, without even a post saying why.  I get that you don't want multiple threads about her being made, but from what I've seen, the mods have been closing legitimate discussions and leaving QQ threads about other champs alone.\n\nIf you say what you're planning on doing with Nid, people will stop making those threads.  Personally, I find the idea of a long range assassin (at least one with as much range as Nidalee) toxic, seeing as how every other assassin has to get into moderate or close range to burst their targets down.  Ahri has to land her taunt, LeBlanc needs to land her chain in order to get a good burst combo, Akali and Evelynn heavily rely on stealth to get close to their targets and escape from retaliation afterwards, Fizz has to get close and personal in order to burst, Zed has short moments of targetability after using his W to get close to his target and ult them before reactivating his W to escape, and even Kassadin was *heavily* encouraged to use his abilities to be aggressive instead of immediately running away after assassinating his target before his rework.  Nid has none of these requirements.  In fact, her passive encourages her to hide in the bush and throw spears at her targets.  It pushes player interaction down to very low levels, and doesn't really require that much skill; as long as she keeps chucking spears, odds are, one of them will hit, since players can't keep juking perfectly indefinitely, and it does so much damage that it either immediately kills them, makes them focus on lifesteal/getting healed to avoid getting immediately focused/bursted, or forces them back to base.  The only assassin that did as much damage as Nid and had just as many escapes was Kassadin, and he got a rework.  He never even had a heal, much less the .7 AP ratio that Nid has on her's.\n\nI find Nid's current playstyle to be very toxic, with extremely low levels of counterplay and player interaction.  Like Gragas, she's able to do massive amounts of AP damage from very far away, and there is almost no downside for her doing so.  She's the only assassin I can think of that is able to do that kind of damage from far away, yet have a spammable dash ability, as well as a very high AP-ratio heal.  Assassins shouldn't be encouraged to stay as far away from their targets as possible, and shouldn't have such powerful sustain in their kits.  Please, Riot, at least tell us what you're thinking about doing with her.  If you're going to close this thread, please at least have the decency to say why it's being closed so future threads won't keep repeating the same mistake.\n\nThis silence is incredibly disheartening.  It makes people think that you're going to leave Nid in her current state.  Any reply is will be very appreciated, and I thank you for taking time out of your day to look at and and reply to my thread.\n\nHopefully this thread in the Community Beta will get more than it did in GD; all I got there was insults and downvotes from angry Nid players.","replies":[{"poster":"Phreak","date":"2014-03-31T06:34:35.824+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":1,"body":"Howdy!\n\nI don't want to spill too much.

That kit mostly tones down Javelin Toss's mid range damage and creates a follow-up opportunity to encourage more time spent in cougar form (which is currently the wave-pushing and teamfight clean up form) (plus strategic map movement I guess).\n\nHowever, to set expectations appropriately: just because we're testing changes doesn't mean those changes necessarily see the light of day. We test a LOT of kits, sometimes with crazy experimental changes (a Brand kit from last year comes to mind where Pyroclasm slowed down after each bounce but could bounce INDEFINITELY so long as the enemy team stayed together), and often the answer is \"probably not worth doing\". \n\nThis is a strength of our design process. We're highly iterative and we realize that there's only so much value to be gained from theory-crafting it all out in your head. There's a time and a place for spreadsheet design, and IMO that's in the very beginning of a design idea, when you just want to get a rough read for the power level. After that there's no substitute for \"just put it in a playtest and see how it goes\". \n\nMy personal feeling is that while everything Repertoire's changing about Nidalee is a positive change compared to live (a couple of GREAT QoL changes like pounce and swipe going toward mouse cursor), we're not addressing the truly grating aspect of live Nidalee, which is random spears chunking you down to 50% health. In theory, Nidalee is mana gated and can't just throw out spears all day. In practice, blue buff exists and Athene's is a gold-efficient pickup even without the mana on it, so yeah. May not be a Nidalee problem. May be a problem of how we're failing to do mana gating in modern League.\n\nBut the kit is still in testing and it's way too early to tell where it's going. Definitely don't expect it to hit live any time soon; these things take time.","replies":[{"poster":"Malah","date":"2014-04-01T04:10:48.196+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":2,"body":"If mana is failing as a resource gate then use the cooldown instead.

Everyone else can just rush chalice if they care that much, and blue buff also exists.\n\nMore on topic, in addition to mana gating not being a thing anymore, she also doesn't really have a cooldown gating her ability to spear people. It's low enough that she can throw several off in a pre-teamfight siege situation and just remove someone from the fight, by either dropping them so low they have to go back, or just killing them.\n\nNid's kit is probably the worst designed in the game, in my opinion. She isn't necessarily overpowered, but all of her power is focused on her spear, and everything else is just gravy. She outheals Soraka for single target healing, she is basically impossible to catch, and she has decent waveclear, though it does force her into melee range of creeps. The only ones I'd say are worse are the recent batch of 'what CAN'T we do' champions, like Lee, Elise, and Jinx.","replies":[{"poster":"The Yung Karma","date":"2014-04-06T08:10:48.654+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah mana totally only matters if your kog maw mid... except for all those top laners I.E. malphite, irelia, darius, gp ,jayce, wukong, POPPY for the love of god poppy  etc. Oh almost forgot all those ad mana dependent mids with no build path for mana.

As has already been mentioned here, I've been doing work on Nidalee for some time now, and I definitely think things are headed in the right direction with her. I can't really share specific details of the kit changes just yet, but I can share some of the primary (there may be others, but these are the forefront ones) problems that we've identified and are working to solve.\n\nProblems:\n\n-The way Nidalee utilizes both forms to succeed is out of whack. She very regularly doesn't have to use Cougar form as part of her killing pattern. This is not only unfair to enemy players, but also just a bit lame as a shapeshifting character.\n\n-Nidalee doesn't put herself at enough risk of death when she succeeds. I personally think it's okay if Nidalee averages a high number of kills every game, but the number of deaths she accrues needs to be a bit higher to reflect that.\n\n-Nidalee is pretty hard to control in Cougar form, and she just feels clunky much of the time. Even in pro games we see people Pouncing/Swiping in the wrong direction while farming or faceplanting into walls they meant to hop over.\n\n\nAs for Javelin Toss, I know this doesn't provide a definitive answer on that subject, and once we have more definitive details on a direction, I'll be happy to talk about them. At this rate, I wouldn't expect Javelin Toss to undergo fundamental changes to its mechanics. It will almost assuredly remain a \"deals more damage at greater range\" ability, and it will hurt to get hit by. Furthermore, it probably won't have cooldown reducing mechanics or ramping mana gates or something like that on it. None of that really matters if the Javelin that does hit you or your carry drops them from 100% health down to 40% at the beginning of the fight, because you're still just forced to leave. In that case, we've just condensed the window of frustration rather that targeting the frustration itself.\n\nLooking forward to sharing more details with you guys once we've something a bit more well-defined to talk about!","replies":[{"poster":"HigeR","date":"2014-04-06T01:11:40.562+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Uhm I don't really get it ._. what you're saying or at least what I'm reading is you won't change Javelin much? no mana gating or cd reduced on-hit but I'm guessing increasing mana cost or cd is still possible?\n\nYou want to decrease frustration from getting hit by a Javelin and... you can't say how it'll be done, which is understandable but shooting down the options above leaves very little space for possible nerfs in our heads lol, like... range or...

Nidalee says \"Claw or spear, your end's the same.\" They need to be equally viable options! Currently, it feels more like you just spear for damage and you never use your cougar form for anything other than running back from base, chasing, or running. More importantly, I feel that she needs to take some from other form change champions. I found Elise really fun to play, and one of her core identity is also a shapeshifting champion. Elise changes shape mid combat in order to maximize her damage. Her most basic combo incorporates the shapeshift - stun QW into spider form execute.  So does Jayce. Nidalee just spams spears and runs away with cougar form. This isn't what we signed up for!\n\nIn line with this, if you land a spear several times, it should be an opportunity to go in as a cougar. This is currently also the case, but only because he's already at 10% HP. Spear damage needs nerf, and cougar form needs to do more damage. Maybe spear can have a decaying slow so that if you land one you close the gap as cougar and stick to them? Or maybe hitting the spear can mark them for death, which will make your cougar form do increased damage? If we stick with the damage increase idea, it also probably means that the absurd 10 second 40% armor / mr shred can go away from her human W, and give bushwhack a true utility spell treatment instead of the absurd armor and mr shred that literally makes a tank useless in a teamfight.

Essentially nidalee needs to be made so that there is a *null* zone where she is very ineffective, get too far away and her spears can chunk you down, get too close and her claws will tear you apart. If you manage to maintain spacing and put yourself somewhere in the middle, her damage goes down and you can effectively deal with her.\n\nHer passive needs work as well because mobility gives way too much defensive power. While nidalee's passive is cool, what I hate the most about it is that nidalee gets to decide every engagement that she is a part of, not her opponent. If a nidalee never wants to get caught, she doesn't have to because she can always be way outside your effective range and never be at risk while healing up from any poke you dish out at her. 90% of the time a nidalee dies it is because they made a mistake, not because their opponent made a great play.

I love playing Nidalee (as a bruiser, so I can't wait for buffs/QoL changes to Aspect of the Cougar) but with all of the power and none of the fun in Javelin Toss, I feel that if there were no changes made to the mechanics of the skill (even though it may retain the \"more damage from more distance\" aspect), then any changes to make it more fun for both parties aren't going to be successful.\n\nYou've heard it several dozen times, but adding more mechanics to the skill makes landing for more damage or dodging damage (and then taking advantage of the downtime) makes the ability require more skill and adds to the satisfaction of everyone involved.\n\n**Adding an arc (where the spear does not hit [see: Ziggs' Bouncing Bomb]) or more distance for the spear to follow due to a charging mechanic** makes the Nidalee player more satisfied the better they get at hitting with the skill (as opposed to \"I'll throw this in a line and it will definitely hit something\").

It retains nids huge capacity for burst and still rewards her for her aim and sniping, but takes away her silly low risk mechanic behind her spears. The mark would probably have to last awhile to be possible to follow up on in cougar form.\n\nIt's an idea I wouldn't be surprised to either be tried or has been tried.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"The7thKing","date":"2014-03-31T15:50:45.563+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Speaking of Kassadin, does it really seem fair that they turned his q from what it was to something like {{champion:112}}'s q?","replies":[{"poster":"Direwolfiez","date":"2014-03-31T19:22:24.204+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Well, I haven't play Viktor that much, but Kass's Q was insane.  He'd Void Walk in, Q, and slow, and you couldn't do jack about it since he'd just keep silencing and slowing you, or Void Walking after you so you couldn't escape.  I don't think that his Q should be like Viktor's, but, my God, there was so little counterplay to Kass's combo it wasn't even funny.\n\nI might be slightly biased, since I play the mages that the old Kass wrecked, but I don't think his old Q was fun to play against.  Even if he countered my favorite champs, I should have been able to do *something* against him.","replies":[{"poster":"The7thKing","date":"2014-04-01T00:15:51.052+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm, if that was the case, i only found it bad like that when kass was fed, if they did bad, it didnt do jack to anyone","replies":[{"poster":"Direwolfiez","date":"2014-04-01T02:57:09.132+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I dunno, every Kass I saw, even if they fed, eventually snowballed due to their insane roam.
