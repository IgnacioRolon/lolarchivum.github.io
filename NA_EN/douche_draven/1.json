Unfortunately that meant forfeiting my loans. As you could imagine time/money is valuable to me at this moment. I have always felt committed to League of Legends, but my rank says otherwise. This is why I set 30 days to climb to Gold 5. This goal is not unreasonable but it will be tough for me because I have not been past Bronze in over a year.\n\n**My Prediction**\n I would guess around 30% success rate judging how this week has been going. In the past 10 days I have been averaging around 20 games a day and am still in Bronze 5. I even hit 0 lp at one point *sigh* \n\n**Authenticity**\nTo maintain authenticity I will be streaming/recording every match. http://www.twitch.tv/30_days_gold_or_quit\n\n**What SHOULD you do!?**\nWell nothing but you can stop by and give me feedback or tips!\n\n**Goal of Challenge**\nTo see how well I can do under pressure and to give me an incentive to work harder.\n\n**Who I Play**\n{{champion:103}} {{champion:1}} {{champion:51}} {{champion:24}} {{champion:74}} {{champion:75}} {{champion:58}} {{champion:110}} {{champion:67}} {{champion:5}} {{champion:77}} \n\n**Who I Want/Learn**\n{{champion:254}} {{champion:7}} {{champion:115}}\n\n**No Chat Uriamu's Keys to Solo-Q**\n\n* Pick Safe Picks\n* Counter\n* Pick Top/Jg First (hard to counter Jg/ figure out who is Jg/Top\n* Ask for ADC when 3-5 pick (5 is better for strong counter)\n* Build to not lose (can't rely on teamwork in Solo-q)\n* Never First pick Mid! EASY TO GET COUNTERED (This can cost you the game)\n* Dodge if a player has bad stats w/ risky champs (ezreal/ahri/teemo)\n* Talk as least as possible\n* Respect yourself and the team\n* Own up to mistakes\n* Defend only if 100% sure\n* Don't argue to long if it is not helping\n\n**How I Went from Sucking to Sucking Less:**\n\n* Observing\n* YouTube\n* Forums\n* Expirementing (dont get to wrapped up in this)\n* Challenging my beliefs of the Game\n\n**To balance extensive League of Legends I will be taking short breaks to:\n**\n\n* Skateboard\n* Stretch\n* Basketball\n* Anime\n\n**Eating**:\nNormally I make Ramen after I queue up or Oatmeal (Looking for more cheap but tastey alternatives)\n\n**Staying Fresh**:\nTo reset my I eyes I will either close them/massage them/use a method called cupping,\nBetween matches I strech/massage the important body parts for League. Hands/Wrist/Shoulders/Hips for sitting\n\n**When I'm down I usually take a quick shower/deep breathe/toke\n**\nThese usually do the trick for nerves or relieving negative emotions.\n-----------------------------------\n\nFinally I want to Thank you for reading/skimming/glancing at my forum post. I know this seems like it is all about me but I believe we can both find value in this adventure!\n\nHere goes nothing! Believe it hehe :D\n\n**William \"signing off\" stay Wookie my friends **","replies":[]}
