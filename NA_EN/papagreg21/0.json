Back when Diana got nerfed to the ground, Riot stated that it was because she had damage, mobility, tankiness, and utility all packed into one.  Lee Sin is the same way. He is too good (or decent) at too many things.\n\nI think the reason why Riot is slow to address Lee Sin's jack of all trades status is because they view Lee as the epitome of a \"difficult\" champion to master/play.  They want mechanically difficult champions to have higher payoffs than \"easy\" champions.  The problem is that this gap in difficulty is purely a figment of Riot's imagination.  Maybe it's because I've been playing at a higher level (Plat/Diamond) for too long that my memory is affected.  But no, the challenge doesn't come from any champion's mechanics, it comes from meta play.  Rotations, awareness, positioning, etc.  These considerations DWARF the relatively tiny gap in champion complexity.  No longer is being skillshot reliant a valid excuse for maintaining overall champion strength.  League is to the point where juggling ~8 different abilities on the same champ and 3-4 item actives is no longer difficult, especially at higher levels of play.\n\nIn fact, I just had this discussion with a friend who is brand new to the game.  He was playing Ashe a lot and kept getting frustrated because in teamfights he would die quickly.  His positioning was bad and I said that if he has a problem with that, then Ashe probably isn't the best ADC for him.  He should look into Ezreal, Lucian, or Caitlyn.  But he said that the Riot graph says those champions are much harder than Ashe.  I told him that was dumb, that Ashe is far more difficult because of her lack of a dash to get out of sticky situations.  But he's right, Riot does promote Ashe as a \"starter friendly\" ADC despite her complete lack of mobility and utility packed into her ability to kite.\n\nWe won't see meaningful change until Riot imposes a uniform champion power budget which allocates the same amount of power to a champion like Ryze as to a champion like Lee Sin.  We won't see that until Riot is ready to admit that flashy moves and skillshots rather than point and click abilities don't make a champion difficult.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shadow Hazard","date":"2017-04-26T20:30:55.098+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the big question after this  is how on earth is there not even some potential things to try out. For example you could say oh we are looking at the options of changing base or scaling value of X skill by Y value, we are looking to reduce the skill damages across the board to put power more into passive, if it turns out that they are still out of line after the midseason changes.\nSaying that they are on your radar and don't want to make changes because next patch could affect them is frankly a cop out and a response that a board detective could very likely find a copy pasted response for a similar issue.\nMidseason as well as preseason is supposed to be the time for sweeping changes even if they aren't on the roster list especially for a champ like lee who can itemize with basically every changed item positively and graves who will have even more options now.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"oSEXYPLATYPUSo","date":"2017-04-26T19:45:45.925+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":52,"body":"but i see {{champion:497}} {{champion:498}} every game \n\nthey have a 79% pick rate and a 89% pick rate while lee is at 35% \n\nto see lee right now would be a welcome change \n\n{{sticker:zombie-nunu-bummed}}","replies":[]}]}
