Look at the recent state of Bilgewater with the \"death\" of Gangplank or Piltover with Jinx blowing things up like the Joker. These seem like such exciting locales but everybody gets along too well in Demacia and powerful champions are just kissing up to Jarvan like it&#039;s their job. \n\nLook at all the Demacian natives. They are all way too honorable and good. There is nobody there creating any conflict. Imagine watching Game of Thrones where you had the same king all the time, and everybody got along great. It would be awful. The only conflict they ever have is minor or with the Noxians who are infinitely more interesting. \n\nI suggest incorporating a coup of Jarvan&#039;s position, a void infiltration of the city or an Ao Shin reckoning for J4 and Shyvana killing dragons. Something to make this part of Runeterra come to life and not just be \"where we put all the good people.\"\n\nEdit: For some reason there are people that are arguing that Demacia is the most favorable quality of life environment in Runeterra as an (argument?) to what I initially posted. I completely agree that I would move there if I were in this world and there is nothing \"wrong\" with being surrounded by good people. I would not want to move my family next to a void portal or to a high conflict area if I physically lived in this world. However, my initial statement was that the lack of morally diverse characters and the successful orderly regime of J4 has created an environment where conflict (and thus exciting story) is rare and usually minor within the confines of the city.\n","replies":[{"poster":"DG Ashabel","date":"2015-09-02T22:23:34.244+0000","up_votes":40,"down_votes":0,"body":"Demacia is boring in the same way Warhammer 40K's Imperium is boring.

At that time, he was known as Viscero and was set to fight 300 opponents simultaneously. He and his opponents were personally rescued by King Jarvan II, and offered a spot in Demacia to get retribution for their torture.

Katarina and Talon are not \"rivals,\" they are everything Demacia stands against - anarchistic and honorless killers. Yes, him cooperating with them is a pretty big deal lore-wise, and is actually mentioned as completely unprecedented within the story.

The one time we show him fighting, he goes completely berserk and attempts to rip Swain's head off with his bare hands.

The main source of my annoyance at this line of thinking (beyond calling him a 'jackass') is this repeated pattern of playing 'gotcha' with characters who would align 'Lawful Good' if this were D&D, namely Demacia. J4 recruited a half dragon? He must have had ulterior motives! The end of his fight with Swain got brutal? What a violent hypocrite! \n\nJarvan is the heir to a militaristic nation beset on all sides by void monsters, killer ghosts, and a long-established rival power waiting for the slightest weakness to take advantage of. It makes perfect sense within the story that Jarvan 4 would have a violent side to his nature, and while he likely did consider the benefit of having the power of a half-dragon at his side when he recruited Shyvana, that doesn't exclude the positive reasons he asked her to join him. Pragmatic thinking doesn't make him the fascist, manipulative 'jackass' some here are claiming him to be. \n\nFrom the lore I've read, Jarvan 4 is a better leader than anyone else is in Runeterra. He listens to his advisers and treats them with respect, no matter where they came from (Quinn), has great acceptance towards other races (Shyvana, Xin Zhao), and doesn't eliminate or assassinate his political rivals. He has demonstrated violence before, but there is such a thing as \"righteous fury\".\n\nViolence of any kind, by the highest standard, isn't moral, but piling onto Jarvan 4 about it is nonsensical. No, he's not a perfect person, but that's because he's a _human being_. As a member of the world of League of Legends, he has to blend righteousness with practicality; but the important thing to remember is when it comes down to it, Jarvan will do the right thing.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"DarkSunSovereign","date":"2015-09-03T11:48:15.548+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In that image where he attacked Swain, you can see LeBlanc's reflection in Swain's chestplate, implying she's taking the form of J4.\nAnd yeah, that's not canon anymore.","replies":[{"poster":"GreenLore","date":"2015-09-03T13:36:16.258+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah,but the Sion promo implies that something like this still happened at one point(its easily possible that the kalamanda incident still happened,just that they battled it out)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Kadavik","date":"2015-09-03T21:55:02.571+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"DID SOMEONE SAY HERESY!?\n\nhttps://yellowcitycomiccon.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/40kwall.jpg","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dextix LT","date":"2015-09-03T04:51:59.305+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"For the emperor.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PapaGreg21","date":"2015-09-03T01:32:09.113+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=DG Ashabel,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=L8XIuUnj,comment-id=000b,timestamp=2015-09-02T22:23:34.244+0000)\n>\n> Demacia is boring in the same way Warhammer 40K's Imperium is boring.

It's just as common as good vs evil tropes now, if not more so since everyone wants to be edgy these days. We already have Bilgewater, Zaun, Piltover, as a source of grey characters. Noxus too even. \n\nI'm afraid that suddenly Demacia is just going to be turned into some tyrannical dictatorship all in the name of being 'grey', when it doesn't fit the theme of so many of the already established characters.
