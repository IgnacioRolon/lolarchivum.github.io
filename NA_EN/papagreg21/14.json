Her clearspeeds gives her a gold and xp advantage, and as soon as her oponents catch up, she's screwed.\nThis is reflected by both her winrate/gamelegth(winrate is fine till 40 min, then it drops massively cause shy already ahd lvl 18 and full gear and the rest now catches up), and her doing shit at top becuase top has a hard cap on the max xp/farm you can get out of it.","replies":[{"poster":"oSEXYPLATYPUSo","date":"2016-07-28T22:37:16.632+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"correct me if im wrong... but i would say any laner should have double to three times more farm then junglers. just as an example a solo laner get levels faster and items faster/more gold then junglers hence why there has been issues in the amount of experience a jungler gets from the jungle and being under leveled.\n\n some of that is due to roaming to lanes to gank but on a consistence basis there is more creeps to farm in lane then in jungle. typically 6 creeps per wave every 30 secs compared to 2 golems, 4 chicken heads, 3 doggies, a big froggie and 2 buff camps with 2 mini mes. buff camps only respawn every 5 mins?  and typically every 45 secs on smaller camps.\n\n i do know that the monsters give more gold then a single lane minion and i know with the {{item:1041}} gives special bonus experience but why is that? its is cuz a jungler has less gold resources and income then laners. hence why a champ like {{champion:102}}  who is farm dependent and item dependent isnt as viable as other junglers. i will agree that if she gets her 140cs and gets a full build she is a nightmare to deal with 1 vs 1 but problem still lies she has no cc. a jungler with no cc isnt a good jungler. \n\ni would prefer on my team any number of other junglers : {{champion:32}} {{champion:131}} {{champion:245}} {{champion:60}}  {{champion:9}} {{champion:105}} {{champion:79}} {{champion:104}} {{champion:120}} {{champion:59}} {{champion:24}} {{champion:121}} {{champion:203}} {{champion:64}} {{champion:54}} {{champion:57}} {{champion:82}} {{champion:111}} {{champion:76}} {{champion:56}} {{champion:2}} {{champion:80}} {{champion:78}} {{champion:421}} {{champion:107}} {{champion:68}} {{champion:113}} {{champion:72}} {{champion:48}} {{champion:77}} {{champion:254}} {{champion:106}} {{champion:62}} {{champion:154}}","replies":[{"poster":"Sire Hippington","date":"2016-07-29T02:32:38.640+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Within 90 sec, you gain ~400g from minions(9 range, 9melee and 1 siege) IF you get ever single cs. if we asume 1 minion missed per wave, it's 3x~20 less so ~340g\nWithin 90sec, you can clear all small camps once for a total of ~370g, not inclueding buff camps, scuttlers or what ever you could get in the opposing jungle.\n\nSo by just farming your own small camps as soon as they spawn, you already can earn more gold than a sololaner with near perfect cs.\nAnd a well played shy will not only clear her own jungle in that time, but also scuttlers and usually succesfully counterjungle.\nSame with nidalee.\nShe has the highest Counter Jungle CS and the seconf most CS in her own jungle amongst all champs and more average gold earned per game than Anivia....\n\nFor most junglerrs you are correct, though 'double to three times more farm then junglers' is vastly exeggerated, unless you mean only the number of cs rather than the resulting gold.\nMost junglers don't clear/path fast enough to get all camps within 90 sec, mostly because of the time they spend on ganks, lurking for counterganks and other stuff. And there is the potential of getting counterjungled. In the jungle, you can actually directly deny the cs of your opponent.\n\n\nAlso, i said nothing about shy beeing strong overall though she does perform decent atm, a solid 50% winrate in the jungle with ~57% on experienced players, which is above average. I said whatever strength she has right now, is caused purely by her clearspeed and the resulting gold lead. And in xp, she usually is even or ahead of the soolanes.\nHer kit it's self is rather weak atm, as soon as she has to fight on even gold/xp, she usually struggles, which is why her toplane is so bad, as she hardly will get a meaningfull xp/gold lead over her opponent since she has little killpresure in lane and can't just powerfarm for a lead, as her opponent will usually get about the same farm.\nSo in the end, the only reason she currently is viable is her artificially increased clearspeed with the 20% bonus damage vs monsters on her W.\nBut instead of removeing that and giving her the buffs she actually needs, they keep that and tinker around with half assed buffs that don't make her any more statisfying to play nore help her sololane, because they are afraid her jungle might get to strong again....","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Lord Galvatron","date":"2016-07-27T18:59:01.483+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You don't need lifesteal and rest of your items being purely defensive after that is your sustain. {{item:3153}} is a noob trap and there are much better items on her.
