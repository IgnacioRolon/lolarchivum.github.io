I honestly never imagined Malphite being turned into an entire pirate ship as a skin idea so more stuff from that guy or girl please. Can't wait to shoot off the cannons.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-09-30T17:25:15.011+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Glad you like it! :D","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Bixits","date":"2015-09-30T17:10:24.510+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Ironside was supposed to go with the Bilgewater release/skins, they altered the images of the other skins to include Malphite.

Judging by the fact that there is an event called The Harrowing, I think there is going to be a new map themed around Bilgewater (or map re skin like Butcher's Bridge). The Harrowing is a black mist that comes from the Shadow Isles that carries the monsters from there with it and it's headed to Bilgewater (Bilgewater is in dis order right now already) and it's going to mess shit up. Three words: Bilgewater. Is. Fucked.","replies":[]}]}
