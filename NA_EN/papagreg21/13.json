And for investing 50% more gold into it, she gets an item that's only 50% as good as Devourer. Guinsoo's, by default, has only AD (which while nice to have is less valuable than attack speed for her), AP (which is so worthless as to be completely wasted stats), and an on-hit proc which does only half as much damage as ZERO STACK Devourer. Compared to full stack Devourer, the on-hit proc is only 1/4 as strong. AP scaling on her E and R don't make AP good on her, because you don't use those skills for damage. E's damage is completely negligible, you're casting it for on-hit proc, which doesn't scale with anything but your opponent's max HP. Likewise, you're not casting R for the damage (though it's at least solid), you're casting it to close the distance between you and your enemy and/or for the increase in defensive stats.\n\nThen, once you get into combat, you can start stacking it up, but a chunk of stacking it up continues to be dedicated to worthless AP and less valuable AD. You have to get 5 stacks before the stat you actually want, the attack speed, is up to par with Devourer/Bloodrazor. You have to get 6 stacks before phantom hit will actually activate, the ability for which you invested so much gold into wasteful stats to get. And even then, phantom hit isn't nearly as good as before, and it all goes back to that pitiful on-hit damage. Devourer at full stacks gives 60 damage on hit, and gives you phantom hit at all times. Guinsoo's gives 15 damage on hit, and only gives Phantom Hit once you've been in combat a few seconds already. And that's assuming you can stick to the target long enough to build stacks up to begin with and then keep them up without them CCing you, or jumping away and kiting you long enough for the stacks to fall off.\n\nThere is simply no way Guinsoo's can possibly put out as much damage on its own as Bloodrazor or even BotRK unless you're pairing it with more offensive items, offensive items that Shyvana can not afford to build. And there's certainly no way Shyvana, an already gold hungry champion, can afford to waste so much gold on useless stats like AP. There's a reason why, if Shyvana does happen to build a second offensive item, it's typically BotRK instead of the current Guinsoo's, despite how strong current Guinsoo's is with Devourer. It's because Guinsoo's is simply too much wasted stats to be justifiable on her, even for phantom hit. Bloodrazor and BotRK will both be more viable choices. Hell, Wit's End would be a more viable purchase than Guinsoo's will be, because at least then she gets good value from the MR steal (since even her AD scaling W deals magic damage), 40% AS by default, and the on-hit damage that hits harder than Guinsoo's does even WITH the phantom hit proc, and all for a much cheaper price point to boot.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"whocares123","date":"2016-04-24T13:08:25.520+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"Guisinoos rageblade. Look at the stats. Really look at them. Tell me it isn't good on shyv. \n\nNo it does not provide sticking power, sustain, or tank stats. \n\nTHAT IS OKAY. If it did, it would be the most broken thing in the game.\n\nWhile shyv does want these stats, she does tend to get at least one offensive item, whether that be sated dev, bork, or the current rageblade (it happens, I play it sometimes, people around me play it), her abilities are often enough to suffice. She already has sticking power with her w and a direct gap closer with her ult.\n\nIt may not always be a core item, but it will definitely be situational if you're vs a team that you need to out-duel or if your team doesn't have enough damage to win fights. \n\nIT IS NOT USELESS STATS FOR THE LOVE OF GOD.\n\nShyvana has TWO AP scalings, one 60% on her e, one 70% on her ult. That is a good bit of damage, assuming 74 ap from a max stack rageblade, that's an extra 40 or so damage on her e and an extra 50 on her ult. Not useless. Yi goes rageblade all the time, and he will continue to do so after the patch - he only has one ap scaling on his heal, and it is nice but not necessary at all for his playstyle, but you don't see anybody complaining about the \"wasted\" stat for him do you?\n\nRageblade, while it doesn't give the extra magic damage on hit that devourer used to, it does give ad - 53 at max stacks. Sated gave 60 mgc dmg per hit, but that's only a 7 damage loss, which will stack up over time. But there's more.....\n\nYou get back 15 magic damage on hit. Which more than makes up for that 7 damage loss. \n\nThe new guisnoos rageblade will be stronger than either sated devourer or the current one.","replies":[{"poster":"Gixia","date":"2016-04-24T21:29:57.313+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay, I looked at them, and I'm telling you it isn't good on Shyv. It has less attack speed than any other offensive item she would want until after she's fully stacked it. It has less on-hit damage than any other on-hit item she could buy. It has AP that does nothing for her. It has AD that, while decent, is not as good for her as raw AS. And finally it has the phantom hit proc, which is less good because you don't get it until after you've fully stacked it, and then once you have it's STILL less good because Guinsoo's own on-hit proc is so weak.\n\nHer W is only sticking power if the opponent has no CC or doesn't understand when to time their CC correctly (which admittedly is a lot of people). Her ult just catches you up to your opponent's mobility skill, which will come off cooldown before your ult will be useable again.\n\nEven if you need to out-duel someone, you will get more value from BotRK or Bloodrazor. If you need more damage, you will buy both of those items before you will buy a Guinsoo's, and if you buy all three you will melt before you get the time to fight anybody.\n\nNo, her AP scalings are NOT a good bit of damage, because damage is (for the most part) not why you're using those skills. E's damage is negligible, especially since it's the skill you level last. You're using it to get the on-hit proc, which doesn't scale with anything but your opponent's max hp. For this reason, you're also using it at the start of a fight, before Guinsoo's has been stacked up. It then has a fairly lengthy CD. If you're opponent actually stands and fights you, good chance the fight ends before it comes back. If they run, the cast time makes casting it while chasing not something you want to do typically. Likewise, her ult is used mainly for the defensive stat boost and to close the gap. Unlike her E, the damage for her ult is at least solid, but not something you're so reliant on that it makes AP in any way desirable. Just because you have an AP scaling does not mean that you want AP, it's still a garbage stat. If it wasn't, then Rylai's/Liandry's Shyvana would probably be a thing.\n\nThe champions who actually use Guinsoo's do so because they can do do something to virtually guarantee they reach full stacks. Jax can stun you. Xin can knock you up. Kayle can hit you from range. And Yi is _genuinely_ unkitable because he's immune to slows. Shyvana has none of those things, and thus she can't force the stacks. Yes, she can Q you to get a burst of them at the start, and then the person she hit can promptly jump away and slow her and that's as far as they'll go. Not only that, but champs who use Guinsoo's (especially Yi) typically build more offensive items than Shyvana can get away with, and so they have more space to build Guinsoo's AND something else, typically multiple something elses, because Guinsoo's typically wants other items paired with it to be strong.\n\nYou do not start a fight at max stacks with rageblade. Giving more damage at max stacks does not mean you do more damage because you need to fight for long enough to GET to max stacks, and then continue to fight for long enough for damage at max stacks to outscale. Plus something you're neglecting, Phantom Hit proc **_does not give a fuck about your AD._**\n\nSeries of Devourer AAs goes like this: 60 > 120 > 60 > 120 > 60 > 120 > 60 > 120 > 60 > 120 = 900 total damage\nSeries of Rageblade AAs goes like this:  35+15 (50) > 38+15 (53) > 41+15 (56) > 44+15 (59) > 47+15 (62) > 50+15 (65) > 53+30 (83) > 53+15 (68) > 50+30 (83) > 50+15 (68) = 735 total damage\n\nSo let's see, after 10 auto attacks, Devourer has done 900 damage, while Rageblade has done 735. While the non-phantom hit proc is dealing 8 damage more thanks to the AD, the phantom hit proc is doing 37 damage LESS because because Rageblade's on-hit proc is so weak. Not only that, but those Devourer AAs all came faster because it has 40% AS by default, and Guinsoo's doesn't hit 40% until stack 5. By time Guinsoo's gets 48% AS at stack 6, the damage deficit is so large that Rageblade isn't going to outscale Devourer unless the fight goes for like 5 minutes, if it outscales it at all.\n\nNow, you could make the argument that the AD makes up for this because it empowers her Q and W, but then AD is also weakened by armour, which more champions have and in larger amounts whereas Devourer's damage is purely magic, with MR typically being present on fewer enemies and in smaller numbers.\n\nThen, afterall that, you take into account that Rageblade is also MORE EXPENSIVE than Devourer is, and not by a small amount, by 1200 gold. This forces her to build Cinderhulk first, which not only delays her damage spike substantially, but also delays her ability to build better tank items. For less gold than that, I could build Devourer and go straight into Deadman's Plate, giving me more damage, more tankiness, faster and for less gold than Cinderhulk into new Rageblade.\n\nIf you are seriously trying to make the argument that new Rageblade is superior to Devourer, you are just straight up wrong.","replies":[{"poster":"whocares123","date":"2016-04-25T09:13:45.535+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Your points are generally fairly valid, and I do know that there are these drawbacks of the this item. That is why I have been saying that it probably won't be a core item on shyv, but it will be very considerable if she was more offensive power. \n\nThere is also the possibility of creating a slightly off-meta build with this item in which you add other items with on-hit damage (wits end for example) and make an on-hit build using this.\n\nIf you were to use this item to it's full effectiveness then you would probably want to buy something like frozen mallet to help against people who kite. \n\nAlso, keep in mind that shyvana's playstyle does not necessarily rely on her being able to chase after people and catch them. This item could add the threat of being able to duel anybody, which in and of itself can allow her to put a ton of map pressure, which is what she should be looking to accomplish in the game. \n\nIt also would make running around the jungle to clear camps very very fast, since you could easily run from one camp to the other with this item fully stacked most of the time. It would also make her stellar at taking down epic monsters (although bork because of it's %max health damage could compete with this).\n\n\"Now, you could make the argument that the AD makes up for this because it empowers her Q and W, but then AD is also weakened by armour, which more champions have and in larger amounts whereas Devourer's damage is purely magic, with MR typically being present on fewer enemies and in smaller numbers.\"\n\nHere's the thing, the mage update is coming out at the same time, and a lot of mages will be very very strong now, you will probably start to see more magic resist items being used that armor when that happens. So, while I would have considered this a good point a month ago, not really when that update hits.\n\nAnd yes there is a staggering gold difference between dev and rageblade, but keep in mind that:\n\nA. Devourer was only available to one person on each team - the jungler.\n\nB. You had to actually stack devourer for at least (if you were really really fast) 5 minutes. And usually you'd end up waiting much longer than that to actually stack it. And in the time it takes to stack devourer, you could easily have already made enough gold to make up the difference of that deficit. \n\nIf you were to take the numbers you gave for what the damage would be every 9 auto attacks, and continue that for another 6 autoattacks, then I understand your point. Because a fully stacked rageblade only beats sated devourer by 3 damage after 6 autoattacks. BUT, I may also say that sated devourer will no longer be in the game. So it's not really worth comparing the two items because we will no longer be able to use one of them lol. And unless your vs a team of mostly tanky people then the devourer replacement isn't going to be very effective, and even then you have to wait till late game to get full effectiveness out of the new jungle item, plus you'd probably be getting that anyway so it doesn't even matter.","replies":[{"poster":"Gixia","date":"2016-04-25T09:49:22.167+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=whocares123,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=IXg1f7mb,comment-id=000300000000000100010000,timestamp=2016-04-25T09:13:45.535+0000)\n> BUT, I may also say that sated devourer will no longer be in the game.

My point was to establish that this is false and they are nowhere even close to equal. And once it's established that Rageblade could not compete with Devourer, to claim that it's a good replacement for the loss of Devourer just because they both share the Phantom Hit proc becomes a losing argument.\n\nAlso, the mage update isn't going to cause every team to suddenly start being 4 mages and an ADC. Armor will continue to be built in greater quantities than MR outside of games where the enemy midlane is snowballing.\n\nOff-meta builds are off-meta for a reason.

It won't need an enemy team full of tanks to be effective, it has 40% AS right from the start without needing to be stacked (with AS being Shyvana's primary offensive stat, this can not be overstated how significant this is), and it's cheaper, allowing her to build tank faster and more efficiently by buying better tank items than Cinderhulk. It also naturally synergizes with her kit by double stacking the max health % shred she already gets from her E.

And I did underestimate blood razor, not fully realizing the implications of  %max health damage. \n\n\"The only unfortunate thing about it is that the damage is physical instead of magic.\"\n\nThat's actually a good thing unless you were actually going to do a build based off of penetration, as it makes it harder to effectively counter build her.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Galvatron","date":"2016-04-25T22:26:12.894+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not sure where the discussion is going, since the original argument was never comparing the two at all (Since comparing the upcoming Rageblade to the current Sated devour is completely pointless because they won't even coexist next patch). \n\nFurthermore, when this new (mage/item/etc.) patch comes out, the meta will change _dramatically_. The mages will be getting supercharged, in which the same exact thing will occur when the Marksmen update came out. You will most likely see multi-mage comps and AP tanks will become literal gods. \n\nMy best estimate is that unless the patch is tuned/augmented down, this will essentially become a second preseason and anything could happen. That being said, with the new update, I can see Shyvana using the new Guinsoo as a means as easy Hybrid damage (for all that is worth, she might be played dramatically less after the patch).","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Kynami","date":"2016-04-23T21:00:34.406+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"This just means she can get phantom hits with going Rageblade after Madreds *or* Cinderhulk and can have a reliable power spike at that point.

Your response makes it sound like Shyvana has to must buy Frozen Mallet every game if she wants \"sticking power\" which is generally false.\n\nShyvana inherently runs faster than most champions on the rift so going for Blue Smite means it allows you to get in melee range and stay there since you simply run faster than your target and still have your ult as a gap closer if they attempt to use one as well. That being said Blue Smite+Cinderhulk into Rageblade and going straight tank (you can even get a Frozen Mallet or Randuin's later if you really have problems sticking to targets) is going to probably be the better build.","replies":[{"poster":"IcyPepper","date":"2016-04-24T00:02:45.916+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"BORK steals slightly more MS and lasts a whole second longer, for one.\n\nAlso it doesn't require taking smite.

It's also an extra second, which makes a huge difference for CC. Plus it also does more damage. All relevant details.\n\nAnd simply running faster than the opponent is not enough on its own. They don't need to run from you forever, they only need to run far enough to catch up with their team, or get to tower safety, or even just get to a wall to jump over. Yes, Shyvana can also jump with her ult, but she gets to do that once, whereas most champs with mobility skills will be able to use their skill multiple times because Shyvana doesn't burst. She's sustained damage which means she has to be able to stand there auto-attacking. The more she has to move, the less auto-attacks she's going to get in, the slower she's going to kill the target, the more time the target has to escape to safety or have mobility and/or CC skills come back off CD. Blue smite is straight up not enough. It has never been enough, it never will be enough. If it was, Shyvanas wouldn't have had to rush BotRK before. They wouldn't still be building BotRK over Guinsoo's now.\n\nAlso, new Guinsoo's into straight tank would be terrible. Phantom Hit isn't even a fraction as relevant if you don't have other on-hit effects to stack it with. Without attack speed, you won't even be able to stack Guinsoo's up enough to get to Phantom Hit in time to be relevant in the fight. Not to mention stats like AP that just does nothing for you. On top of that the fact that Guinsoo's is also more expensive. So you're taking longer to buy an item that's less good for you to begin with, that you can't even use half of, and that doesn't do much until you buy other items later, items that you can't buy because you're apparently going full tank.\n\nThat is a terrible idea. Guaranteed it will not be the better build. Not only will it not be the better build, it won't even be a VIABLE build compared to Bloodrazor or BotRK.

At least she gets huge value from the MR shred.\n\nShyvanna is faster than most champs because of her W. She has absolutely no issues outrunning many many champs. Feel free to chase her through the Fire and the Flames. And that \"one time only\" ult has saved my ass so many times I cannot count it. Its range is much greater than almost every other mobility skill in the game. RW, lata.\n\nShyvanna is perfectly capable of bursting. I've bursted entire teams with Sated Devourer + Rageblade just by pressing REWQ with my cursor on them. 2 or 3 AAs later everyone is gone and I'm sitting there asking myself \"WTF just happened? Why are they all dead? Oh, yeah, and who stole my penta?\"\n\nShyvana's E applys a debuff that deals 2.5% max HP physical damage on hit. So she scales quite well with AS items. And the new Bloodrazor adds an additional 3% on top of that.\n\nShyvana has 2 AP scalings in her kit; on her ult and on her E. So the AP from Rageblade is not at all wasted. As for stacking it, please press WQ. Watch her stacks go from 0 to 6 in about 1 second.\n\nI'm not saying you should build Rageblade after Bloodrazor every game you play her jg. You will be very squishy if you do. The default is still going to be Titanic Hydra. But Rageblade will still be good on her because she will still be able to stack it quickly, and she will still benefit from everything that it gives her. The biggest hurdle will be its new much higher cost.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"LegacyDAP","date":"2016-04-23T21:13:55.486+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":8,"body":"Buy Guinsoo's build tank.
