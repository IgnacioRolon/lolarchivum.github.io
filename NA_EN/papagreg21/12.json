Even if her w was nerfed in power or slow, at least you would be able to be more dynamic in your playstyle early without having to wait until you built a mana regen item first. I don&#039;t even use w until a mana item is built because I need q and e too badly and can&#039;t risk not having them available.\n\nUpdate: Many people are suggesting a Q damage reversal from the previous nerf. I agree this would be an alternate path to bring her to better viability in the current meta. However, I feel that the mana buff would be viewed as more favorable for both Syndra players as well as Syndra opponents who considered her q damage to be too oppressive back in season 4. I can't remember anybody saying they were ever sick of her spamming her slow moving w on them too often and thought it was unfair.","replies":[{"poster":"shteeeb","date":"2016-03-07T18:32:28.813+0000","up_votes":25,"down_votes":3,"body":"Diamond Syndra player since season 3.\n\nNo. Her mana is fine. I've never had real mana problems with her.\n\nThe only buff she needs is her Q early damage back. 50 base damage is completely pathetic. If the enemy laner is running MR blues, it will do an autoattack of damage (or less.)\n\nI've started taking W at Lv.1 since it does way more damage and actually makes it so you can trade early.\n\nIf they give her back her old 70 damage Lv1 Q again, she will be completely fine.","replies":[{"poster":"TwinTon3","date":"2016-03-07T18:55:31.250+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"You friend, are a legend.

She only gains the bonus once a skill reaches max rank. By then it's what, close to 15-20 minutes? (Could be lower if you go rouge and bully.) I posted a thread a few weeks back about how it could be tweaked for the better after Meddler said they were going to tweak it during the MYMU. Especially in this speed fest League is in. They could spread the passive evenly among all levels. Like this:\n\n* Dark Sphere: Deals 5% bonus damage at Lvl 1, 10% at Lvl 3, and 15% at Max. (I'd even take 3%/6%/9%/12%/15%.)\n* Force of Will: Increases the slowing duration by 11% at Lvl 1, 22% at Lvl 3, and 33% at Max. (Even 7%/14%/21%/28%/33% would work.)\n* Scatter the Weak: Spell width increases per level by 10%/20%/30%/40%/50%.\n* Unleashed Power: Range increased by 25/50/75.\n\nThat way you don't have to rush a single skill in order to get the boost. And it works with you throughout the entire game. Honestly I think Syndra is probably the only champ in my pool--maybe all of League--that has a passive like this. (I only have like 30 champs out of the 250 available.) I understand it adds more strategy into your skill path, but to me it feels like a small hindrance. God knows I wished for some extra stats during the early game. Especially when you see other passives that work with AA's. If they could tweak the passive into a format like I mentioned, I bet Syndra would get a lot more love.","replies":[{"poster":"Vistha Kai","date":"2016-03-07T23:14:20.835+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's exactly why I used the word \"tweaking\".\nWhat you are proposing is borderline rework.\n\nBut that's semantics.\n\nI also dislike the \"beating around the brush\" balancing technique.\nI prefer to fix the problem.

Ult to get a bunch of balls out first and then E and you can possibly stun 3-4 enemies in a teamfight which could turn the whole fight. The range of her stun + her burst makes her great in soloqueue.
