Or she loses because the enemy jungler has more map pressure than her.\n\nIt's really quite a binary situation.

A lot of people when they think of junglers will immediately think they should be able to gank and have to do it. But Shyvana's power at objective control and counter jungling is really powerful in its own right and I think people just don't realize it. At the time of devour being removed originally, the dragon buffs weren't exactly worth it at the time, same with Rift Herald. So there wasn't much strength in objective focused junglers. The other large issue that has effected shyvana, which didn't bother her in the past, has to be the amount of mobility and anti-mobility added to items ever since mid-season 5.\n\nTo explain, AP junglers have {{item:1410}} , Bruisers have {{item:3078}} {{item:3025}} {{item:3071}} , Mid laners have {{item:3285}} {{item:3100}} {{item:3116}} , ADC's usually pick two of {{item:3078}} {{item:3085}} {{item:3094}} {{item:3046}} {{item:3087}} , and even supports have {{item:3504}} and there's an abundance of CDR now for most roles that allow for easier to access kiting and mobility spells, making kiting or just straight up out running a Shyvana really easy, and she just never got much of anything to help her keep up. It's to the point where I've felt like {{item:3022}} {{summoner:6}} is completely necessary just to keep up with people. And I'm not talking about keeping up with a Leblanc or a Fizz or Lucian, I'm talking about keeping up with a Jinx or a Viktor.\n\nNow I'm not going to scream for some god-like buffs to happen, no. She doesn't need more damage because if she gets on someone, it's fine. She just has way too much trouble now getting on to people and staying on. If anything, I think her W - Burnout should get a change to where the movement speed duration and decay are reset whenever she lands a basic attack to extend the duration. This way she doesn't have an easier time reaching someone in the first place, just an easier time to stay on them after reaching them.
