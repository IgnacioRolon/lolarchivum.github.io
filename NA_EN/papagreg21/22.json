This is getting incredibly tiresome after playing this game for years as somebody that enjoys the tank role, I see the same champs getting dumpstered over and over again as soon as they become somewhat playable because heaven forbid somebody can actually CC Lee Sin, Ekko and Yasuo and their incredibly bloated and overpowered kits and provide some form of peel. Nautilus already does so little damage that ADC's are happy when he's around because he's a big fat barrel of lifesteal to heal up after a fight. He already moves about the same speed as Rammus with his fun new 400% self inflicted slow on his W. \r\n\r\nEither revert the changes from 2 years ago and put offensive power back into his shield or give him bonus damage on jungle camps.

Lately though I tried him support, man.. he needs some love. Bit more attack speed, or animation speed up, cause I can't even hit someone before they auto, ability, auto me. Lower cooldowns, faster attack animation, or something. \n\nRandom idea.. Make his Q throw like Olaf's Q. But stun the opponent for X amount of time.
