For that reason I think her passive helps new jungle players to focus on controlling the dragon. But, that leaves much to be desired. The reward she gets from perfectly securing dragons isnt worth it and the penalty for having a bad game is crushing. I'd like to see her passive reworked into something that actually helps her throughout the game even if she's not securing every single dragon on spawn. \n\nAnother problem I have with her is how predictable she is. Once she presses W you know she's just going to run at you and hope she kills you before she has no way of catching you anymore. Anyone with mobility can kite her into oblivion. \n\nI love the concept she brings to the table as a half dragon badass, but her usefulness comes solely from getting fed and stat checking until the game is over. She offers very little in terms of outplay potential.","replies":[]}]}
