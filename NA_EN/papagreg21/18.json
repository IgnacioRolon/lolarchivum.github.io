I&#039;ve been going &quot;the long way&quot; around minions for quite a while and this issue never really seems to improve. Also, super minions aren&#039;t putting a priority on structures at Nexus towers and are instead chasing enemy minions and switching back and forth between priorities. \r\n\r\n2) Be more proactive in how they are dealing with the last few months of games crashing on Macs. Like others, I have sent in a ticket to Riot and was told that the issue is on Apple&#039;s end and it is up to them to fix it. This is frustrating for the players because\r\n                a) Riot hasn&#039;t even put out a statement notifying Mac players that High Sierra OS is causing known crashes \r\n                b) They should be more specific with what the problem is other than &quot;it&#039;s Apple&#039;s fault.&quot;\r\n                c) It seems like they have just &quot;given up&quot; trying to find an answer to the solution.\r\n\r\n3) Find a solution to Daisy&#039;s bugs and glitches. Controlling Daisy is similar to trying to beat the game Octodad. You&#039;re not entirely sure what&#039;s going to happen when you give her instructions.","replies":[]}
