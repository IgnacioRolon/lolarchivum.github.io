His kit isn't balance able. He needs an entire, full gameplay update to be back in business. Vladimir's level of frustration to play against is immense. He has two skills that cannot be dodged and two skills that are instant cast so you need either mobility or range to play around them.\n\nVlad has no resource bar. He sits in top lane and never leaves. He, along with Mordekaiser pre rework, is the definition of a brick wall, except that he's harder to gank.","replies":[{"poster":"ForeverLaxx","date":"2015-12-12T21:04:20.026+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Vlad is easy to gank before he hits level 9, when his Q finally has a low enough cooldown to be slightly better than a sick joke of an ability. On release he was far more oppressive because they gave his Q too much range, and as much as I want that range back even I know it was too high. I wasn't aware that players are still afraid of and timid against Vlad in the lane. Of course, my experience playing him means I know exactly how to play against him and if your jungler isn't willing to gank your lane early and often, that's not Vlad's fault.\n\nIn any event, I'm not getting bogged down into a discussion about Vladimir in this capacity. The point of my mentioning of him was that he's probably the best example of a champion who's been left in a weak state due to nerfing him before the problem items were nerfed, but not going back and seeing where he could be brought back up.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Stellafreyja","date":"2015-12-10T17:39:24.304+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":1,"body":"They're referring to when Sejuani was extremely strong with Cinderhulk.

Melee carries cannot build things like warmog's or sterraks. Also fighters (Jax,  Irelia) need to be kept entirely separate from melee carries (yi, trynd). They aren't the same class, they don't do they exact same thing. \n\nMelee carries are meant to be glass cannons with among the highest dps potentials but are kept in check by having to be melee. Typically they also get the best tools to avoid damage/death comparatively to other melee champions (yi's meditate/trynd's ult/Yasuo's windwall).\n\nConversely fighters are anti-carries that are tanky enough to initially survive a carries damage, mobile enough to get to them, damaging enough to kill them, but rely on items to fully achieve all of those. These champions can't build glass cannon and expect to be successful as they won't be able to survive long enough, and they can't build full tank as they won't deal enough damage.","replies":[{"poster":"Vagabound","date":"2015-12-15T04:18:34.602+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The fighters you described are the assassin esque variant. Xin, Irelia, and Jax being three of them. They walk between the blurry line of melee carry with their defense steroids being balls of stats, massive tenacity reduction, and complete avoidance of auto attacks. There are a few more like them but those 3 stand out the most within their odd subset because of how strong they are when they're able to do what they do. \n\nMelee carries aren't meant to be glass cannons, juggernauts should be a big reminder of this. Melee carries are characters who're able to output enough sustained damage to hold their and a few more people's weight in a teamfight with items. That's when League's character designs start to get thrown out of whack, especially in the fighter department. Quite a few of them, mostly earlier development, were designed to be melee carries who aren't as easily dealt with in fights like Master Yi(who at the time was significantly less reliable as he is today) and Tryndamere(whose design is a failure in my opinion, even post rework). Instead of Meditate or Undying Fury, they were given a moderate amount of CC, a good amount of stats, and a lot of single target damage that isn't on a long cooldown. Can't forget the mandatory self heal and long cooldown AOE damage ult.\n\nAssassins are anti-carries. They go in, pick off their target, go out. Fighters that can reliably do an assassin's job border the line of semi squishy melee carry because they have little in the way of getting out, so their kits are loaded with \"you can do more if you stay in the moment.\"","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
