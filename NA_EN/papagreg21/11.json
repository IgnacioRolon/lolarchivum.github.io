Champs like annie, brand and velkoz can just line up in a support role and oppress the enemy lane but janna, nami and these other support mages scale so poorly with ap you could never succeed consistently with them in a solo lane (except maybe sona). If supports weren&#039;t just 100 percent utility and no damage after the first 2 minutes of the game people would be interested in playing them more often. \n\nAnd you know what, if they get too strong as a result, so be it. Maybe that&#039;s what the role needs to get people interested in it again.\n\nEdit: Let's all be honest here, nobody is demanding that supports be able to 1 on 3 the enemy but the amount of damage they do past level 6 is beyond small. I am not advocating they be able to do anything more than REASONABLE damage under heavy AP-AD builds. Their current offensive damage with these builds is unreasonably low in my opinion and should be addressed.

The reason I made the super sarcastic comment is because this is a thread about supports being underplayed and not doing much damage and generally aren't viable elsewhere (gross over-simplification and stuff, but it's basically focusing on supports). Zed's a mid, not a support or a mid who is played supp sometimes. That's why I found it irrelevant to the discussion at hand.\n\nAnyways, Zed may be safe, but he's easily countered. I'm not gonna say that Zhonya's totally negates his damage or whatever, but the fact is, before the Duskblade, he was definitely manageable and has tons of counterplay, not just itemization. Avoid his shadows, especially early game. Dodge shurikens, but if you can't do that, stay behind your minions. Don't overextend. Don't play aggressively. Avoid getting close enough that he can throw a shadow on the side of you opposite to him so he can get an easy EQ then switch with his shadow to AA+E and ignite for the kill.\n\nDon't stay in lane with low health, especially if he has ultimate. Play incredibly safely once he has ultimate if you haven't killed him yet (which is difficult to do as he's incredibly strong and pretty safe early on). Most Zeds are impatient and will towerdive you, and if you have high health, you will kill him or at least get him to waste ultimate. If you don't let Zed get kills, he falls off pretty hard. Ping if he's MIA so he doesn't get fed off of the rest of your team. An unfed Zed is pretty much a liability to the team he's on.\n\nThen Tahm Kench, I don't play him so Idk. He's just pretty ridiculous rn. Zed is too with the new item for sure.\n\nAnd your last sentences, well, your post I first replied to didn't really make it out that you were saying that too well. The fact is, most supports have a lot of utility and CC, so it would be pretty fucking terrifying if a lot of those supports were played elsewhere. Zed has a slow and damage and mobility, no hard CC. If supports had more damage and were made stronger in other positions, it would require significant nerfs to their CC because lots of utility and hard CC mixed with damage is absolutely unfair, which is why Sejuani during the Cinderhulk meta was so OP whoever thought she should remain in that state for as long as she was deserves to be locked in an asylum.\n\nBasically, utility + cc + damage would be really quite unfair and it's very difficult to make a champion that is primarily designed for utility purposes into a viable pick in other lanes without significantly increasing their damage or sustain output so they can do things on their own more easily. That would be unfair because then supports would have those increased stats which would not only make them good in other lanes, which on its own would be okay, but would make them fucking monstrous played as supports because they'd still have their utility and CC, but with added damage and such.\n\nAt least that's the way I see it.

Just shit tons of damage and an AoE nuke with a stun (is the Annie has half a brain) and Brand has damage and a pretty long stun.\n\nThey're supports when you want to do tons of damage, not tons of utility. Kill pressure is gained by sacrificing utility in these places. And if you took, say, Thresh, and made him do much more damage, then he would be insanely overloaded and overpowered. You simply cannot have a champion with as much utility as a support and give them a great deal of damage because not only would they be pretty strong in other lanes/roles, but when played as a support, they'd be absofuckinglutely insanely overpowered.\n\nThe only way to give more damage to supports would be to mess with numbers a bit so they have higher ratios but lower bases, I think I'd be okay with that, but that would make builds that don't involve damage being built trash tier. But, it's either that or nerf their utility, which would kill the whole purpose of the support class.\n\nI'm barely capable of thinking on a higher level right now, so I apologize if this was worded poorly or something in advance.","replies":[{"poster":"DELI MEATS","date":"2016-02-17T03:41:19.143+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You are completely right. {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}} \n\nIt's just that I'm a support main and it would help me to be able to play those champs elsewhere.
