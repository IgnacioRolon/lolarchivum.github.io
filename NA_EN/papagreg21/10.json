They re-spawn faster rewarding players (I wont say champs bc tbh most champs do not need to afk farm unless you need 6 like Eve) who AFK farm and it doesn't set players back who gank more since they will soak exp and get gold from ganking + there JG. In reality in the end you will be 1-2 levels down from someone who AFK farms but have way more gold.

Scuttle changes is a vision reward for the one who get to take down the scuttle. Your team get visions to control objectives. And to control/prevent the enemy jg from ganking.

I don't think you quite understand how to make jungle healthier as a role. If anything the role needs nerfs since it's so impactful.\n\nWhat you CAN do is make camps harder to clear so then junglers have to actually work around their HP and timings again.","replies":[]},{"poster":"xDogMeatx","date":"2018-12-02T01:38:11.772+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"why not give junglers power ups which rewards \"same side\" jungles a incentive to still in jungle at least a little to slow their aggression towards laners so they dont oppressively gank a \"certain\" lane. if a gromp is on your side of jg if you kill it you get a gromp mini shield or something (you get the idea).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Speedy 19","date":"2018-12-02T00:43:25.403+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Problem with buffing the exp rates in the jungle is if you do an early gank and the enemy jungler does not counter jungle you to punish you now we are back to where we started but now the camps give you more exp to catch up/ level up even faster. Another issue with this is if you just power farm your camps gank and repeat you will be over leveled really quickly and again we will be back in the place we started with. If you really want \"fix\" the jungle i would say look in the direction of the really early seasons of the game where camps did not give that much exp and gold but they spawned quicker. Or you can nerf the items and stats of junglers but i think that this method of \"fixing\" the jungle is a terrible idea","replies":[]},{"poster":"KmSneaky","date":"2018-12-02T09:55:48.290+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I definetly would understand your statement, but if the jungle exp/gold was buffed, I would want the sustain from flowers/ jungle items/red buff to be nerfed, characters with a good clear in a more rewarding jungle would just get out of hand, we already see junglers like {{champion:121}} {{champion:107}} {{champion:11}} {{champion:5}} {{champion:104}} {{champion:120}}  come into lanes and 1v1. If jungle camps get buffs without any form of compensation so that junglers actually have to manage their HP/mana before ganking, I'm against it. Red buff needs to heal at least 50% less HP since it already has a slow and true damage, {{item:1039}}  passive mana regen needs tuning somehow, and the ridiculous 1st scuttlecrab meta needs to change too...","replies":[]}]}
