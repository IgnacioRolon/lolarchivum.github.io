Like making her passive to where she freezes the ground the she walks (glides?)on and casting abilities does the same. I think this would work really well thematically since she would literally \"bury the world in ice\".  Idk if it would be a good idea to to give her \"ice\" as a recourse like seth had for \"sand\", but it would be something to think about. I really like Lissandra, but she has been one a riots \"stepchild\" champs that gets nerfed the instant they start doing well for as long as i can remember.","replies":[{"poster":"PapaGreg21","date":"2016-12-02T03:05:48.001+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really love this idea. What if when she casts Q in a direction and no minions or champions are hit she creates an ice path that increases her movement speed? This would make her one of the premier midlane gankers because she could travel top and bot lane quickly.

So, for example, something like:\n\n* **Innate - Iceborn:** If Lissandra takes no action while in combat, she initiates a channel and, upon completion, encases herself in ice, rendering herself temporarily untargetable and healing herself over the duration, with the healing increased based on her missing health. Iceborn has a long cooldown, reduced by hitting enemy champions (maybe large monsters, too?) with her abilities. Taking any action or receiving ability-impairing crowd control breaks the channel.\n\nIirc, Taliyah had a similar innate at some point in her development. The passive itself could carry some unique gameplay, as it would require Lissandra to pause, often in the middle of heated enemy combat. It could also free up her options somewhat, as she'd be more free to use her ult offensively after diving the enemy team. What are your thoughts on this, or the general direction of this kind of effect?\n\nEDIT: Alternatively, if the issue is simply that Lissandra just doesn't need a major additional effect, why not just move her persistent crowd control to her innate? Something like:\n\n* **Innate - Black Ice:** Lissandra's abilities cover the area they travel in black ice for a short duration, revealing and slowing all enemies who touch it.\n* Remove Ice Shard's own slow, and perhaps mention that Frozen Tomb's Black Ice is much stronger, if needed (alternatively, it could just be standard Black Ice, since her E would be able to slow as well).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Stibnitive","date":"2016-12-04T19:05:03.875+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I want to leave a little bit of feedback.\nI tried Lissandra with the Colossus mastery and it felt absolutely amazing to play with her like this. Going in balls deep while not fearing for your life and immediately needing to ult yourself or use zhonyas. \n\nHe's my idea, which I think might work since she has both soft and hard cc in her kit: using hard CC she gets a shield that scales strongly per level and weakly with AP (no hp scaling). She gains a shield based on the amount of enemies she hard CC's. Every time she CC's an enemy in general, the CD of the passive drops (cd also heavily drops with levels, starting with an incredibly long cd, but ending with a shield you can proc twice in slightly longer teamfight if you cc people). It also drops per person hit by the cc. Half a second for one person hit with a Q, one second for two people hit with one Q. Something like that.\n\nAnother idea, which is more reliable, less 'colossussy' is still a shield, but one on a charge system. Same with the other shield, it has a ridiculously long cooldown at first that gets better rapidly (think malz' p, only with cd reduction every level instead of every 6 levels) and starts with a potential 2 stacks at level one to 5 stacks at level 16. Every time you hard CC an enemy, you consume a stack and gain a shield, and this happens for every enemy cc'd. There is no cooldown in acquiring shields, however, if you cc the same person that you still have a shield from again (like a W and R combo), it refreshes the shield. Shields are only additive if you hard cc unique champions. Once again, CC (hard and soft) lowers the CD on the charges. I think this one is a bit more healthy, workable and unique. It gives healthier trades (less predictable in the laning phase than a general shield because of the time in between stacks consumed instead of a static period of terror, while also not suddenly making her completely defenseless for half a minute after a trade in the laning phase. This is okay because Lissandra's E is very slow so she's already rather predictable)\nAlso, the shields should be very small as one, but big when multiple stacks at the same time are consumed. This is healthy for both Liss and the enemy.\nAnother problem this solves is that it doesn't suddenly make Lissandra a backline diver that can't be killed because of the shield but still blows up your enemy: Lissandra heavily relies on hitting enough enemy with her CC to get a shield big enough that doesn't make her die instantly while trying to blow up the ADC (the E is slow and anticipated). Instead, it makes Lissandra want to be in between the front and backline of the enemy.\n\nAnd the reason acquiring a shield doesn't need a cooldown is because she only has one ability that snares a lot of people at the same time. Until that one gets back up, all she can get is a small shield from her R. Her W cd is essentially her shield cd.\n\nEither way, I think the 'charge system shields' system is interesting, even if it isn't for lissandra. Then again, she basically has the perfect kit for this very idea.\n\nAlso, I know you tested 'liss with shield passive' before and it didn't feel good somehow, and I assume it was because it made her basically Diana (full damage, blowing up the ADC and getting away with it). My idea is a bit more nuanced that favors teamplay way over assassin potential. Also, I think it's easier to balance since a shield is very early too big for 1v1 but too small for a teamfight.\n\n\nAnd finally, about colossus: Can we make (de)buffs pingable? When I play tank and my colossus is down, I want to be able to ping that, and how long it takes until it's up. 30 sec is a long time to estimate for your teammates. I also think it's a good idea to be able to ping the baron buff, or a passive to an active ability that's active, or the amount of stacks you have as nasus, veigar or thresh. Sometimes I feel it's also useful to ping that you have grievous wounds so that your support should wait with healing you after a trade.\n\n\nI really hope you will consider this idea for testing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Divewing","date":"2016-12-01T23:09:42.738+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"After reading Quinn's \"Journey into the Freljord\", I was inspired to make something like this:\nPassive: Terror of the Frozen Queen\nEnemy champions who remain within 350 units of Lissandra for 2.5 seconds are feared for 1/1.25/1.5 seconds (at levels 1/7/13).\n\nJust thought it'd speak volumes for how terrifying she really is.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Handy Sandy ","date":"2016-12-01T21:13:51.613+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Her passive is fine, since her Q has a high mana cost.","replies":[{"poster":"Teridax68","date":"2016-12-01T22:53:33.681+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's the issue, though, her Q has a high mana cost precisely because of her passive.
