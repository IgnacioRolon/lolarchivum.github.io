Maybe I&#039;m wrong, but this seems like an unhealthy think to do if that was in case the reason for his 6+ month domination of everybody else. I think I wasted my time writing 2 dozen posts on boards about how it was shocking that Graves was allowed to have a faster clear, be tankier, and do more damage than all the other junglers while maintaining full health, scaling well into all levels of the game and having the ability of being ranged.","replies":[{"poster":"Cocho","date":"2017-10-07T01:05:08.136+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I gotta disagree, they hit that man with insane nerfs patch after patch. \nThings like removing an animation cancel, true grit no longer giving him mr, the base dmg on his q, and the cooldown of his Q and R. \n\nTbh, its annoying how much harder they nerf damage people that are on top, and we gotta sit with ardents, it's supports, and very strong tanks for months.\n\nBad game design is why it was hard to put that man down imo","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rustling Bush","date":"2017-10-06T23:55:22.830+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"how is graves overtuned? didn't he get like a major nerf to his dash that made him much less tankier.","replies":[{"poster":"PapaGreg21","date":"2017-10-07T00:45:46.664+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He isn't anymore but he used to be a 20% play rate for months because he just stomped other junglers.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2017-10-07T00:25:31.409+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"people only see what they want to see","replies":[]}]}]}
