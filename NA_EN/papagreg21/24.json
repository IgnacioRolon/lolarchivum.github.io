I have played Shyvana jungle for close to 100 games this year because it&#039;s what I enjoy doing. Since the scuttle changes, I often find myself 3-4 levels below top laners and a couple levels below the other jungler, which is infuriating because Shyvana is a jungler that only succeeds when she can maintain a gold and exp lead over other junglers and laners. That is how her powerfarming kit works. She also sucks at level 2 dueling, especially compared to WW, graves, xin and about a dozen other champs because her Q got nerfed during the devourer era and was never brought back to normalcy so it hits like a wet sponge now. I&#039;ve tried playing treeline during this patch but there are so many bot accounts in there that every other game is ruined. Why is Riot trying to force this scuttle change so hard?","replies":[{"poster":"KlydeFrog","date":"2018-05-24T15:46:12.680+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not sure how your that underleveled.
