Riot take a long time to answer, so maybe someone here know how to fix it.","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Soooooo, where to start. My boyfriend was playing, and his cat went on his keyboard and press some key. It made that all the icon, name, even the  cursor where offbeat. For example, names were on every champ, like inside them. And the cursor was somewhere on the screen, but it clicked somewhere else. \r\nMy boyfriend finish the game like this, and restart the launcher. When he tried to play again, everything was alright. The queue was ok, the champ select was ok. But when the game started, he saw the league of legend on the screen, but it crash just after, with a bug splat. He tried to repair the files, downloaded it again, but nothing changed. \r\nI think it's a problem in the computer itself, like in the settings. Does anyone know what did the cat changed, and maybe know how to reverse it?\r\nOr maybe I'm wrong, and there's something else to change?\r\nAnyway, thx to everyone who wants to help. We'll really appreciate it.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-06T21:46:22.241+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was going to say that it sounded like your drivers may have been outdated.
