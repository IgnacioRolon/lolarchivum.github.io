People don't play the game expecting to find ridiculous stuff like this - there's a reason the person who uploaded the video thought it was a bug.\n\nI'm not sure how serious you're being but if this isn't a joke, \"It's Riven's fault\" is absolutely ridiculous. You can't be expected to figure out 1-in-10000-games situations like this in a split second, especially when they look as buggy as this. 90% of people would just assume their game is glitching out or something.","replies":[{"poster":"EvilMerodach","date":"2015-10-06T16:16:27.489+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Minions always creep block. Why do you think {{summoner:6}} and several skills have \"ignore unit collisions\" on them? It's not for the rare time when you're unable to move because of a minion wall.\nThe difference is if you're partially creep blocked, or fully creep blocked. Full creep block is rare, but it happens. Partial creep block happens every time you have to move slightly though/around any other unit, you'll always get bumped off it/it will bump off you (unless you have the 'ignore unit collision' effect on at the time).\n\nThe Riven should learn to attack-move or a-click. That in itself would fix the problem without even having to think about it.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Cunta Kinte","date":"2015-10-05T11:32:01.167+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"What is Riot's position on CB, now that you've acknowledged this post","replies":[{"poster":"LaoBushido","date":"2015-10-05T18:35:39.749+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{item:3046}} ?","replies":[{"poster":"GundayMonday","date":"2015-10-05T20:44:50.398+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"also {{summoner:6}} ?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"1Ferdinand1","date":"2015-10-06T13:10:07.979+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This exact bug happened to me some times ago as Taric, he ulted me in the red side red, i bounced on a wall and got stuck in the middle of his wall, could not use flash or other spells but only Targon active.
