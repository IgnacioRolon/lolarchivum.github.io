I have been playing LOL since season 4 and have a computer that can handle it really easier, but this past week or two i cant make it through a game without it crashing my computer. Randomly throughout games i will lag and have a black screen that i could either wait out( 5-15 seconds) or ctrl alt delete to fix. the rest of the computer works fine and really fast, only the game client freezes. This will happen 10 or so times before my entire computer gets the blue screen of death and reboots itself. Ive already reinstalled the game and done a msconfin clean up. can someone please help","replies":[{"poster":"Dark Morgana","date":"2015-10-08T18:03:30.398+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"What's your FPS at?
