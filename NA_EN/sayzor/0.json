Every time I try to load a game, it either flashes \"Low on memory\",   \"failure to create dump (random stuff)\", or it bugsplats.  I have 8 gigs of RAM with nothing else open (and if anything one internet tab). So i am not sure why i would be having RAM issues lol. And i don't know what would cause the other issues. Any one have any idea? It always happens during the loading of the game. (I have done tests and my ram is not bad for the record)","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-14T16:42:03.685+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bugsplats are usually caused by driver or hardware issues, so I definitely recommend investigating further.

So thank you!!\nI do still get low RAM notifications with only the client and one chrome tab open though, I'm not sure what would be causing that. I have 8 gigs and ran the Windows Memory Diagnostic tool and it said my ram wasn't bad. Unless the client or google chrome take up a lot more memory now.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-18T16:06:08.398+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Chrome has been known to take a lot of memory, especially if you have a decent number of tabs open. I recommend closing out unnecessary tabs or chrome entirely, to see if the memory messages still pop up.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
