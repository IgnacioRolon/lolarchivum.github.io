The borders are automatically unlocked, but they are specific to the newer project skins, not just any champ or skin.  The border will appear on  PROJECT: Vayne, PROJECT: Vi, and PROJECT: Jhin only.  If you don't have the skin now, it's okay, their borders will be ready should you unlock one in the future!","replies":[]}]}
