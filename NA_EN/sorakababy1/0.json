But, now all the sudden every time I load into a game the second I load in my whole computer freezes and starts making a buzzing noise from the speakers. I can't control ult delete, tab out, or anything I have to force shut off my laptop. So, I have scanned my laptop for viruses(none), checked all my hardware(no issues), run stress tests and everything I can think of. This only happens to my laptop when I load into a game with league. Nothing else I do on my laptop causes this issue. I was wondering if anyone else has ran into this before? I am at a loss of what to do.\r\nMy league name is sadie bear. Incase riot sees this and wants to take me out of low priority que, because it's not my fault I was placed into it :(.\r\n\r\nAny insight or suggestions would be so appreciated. Than you.","replies":[{"poster":"hyperion3182","date":"2016-10-04T14:57:32.167+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello, are you a Windows 10 user who got a recent W10 Anniversary update?
