It's a thing across gaming in general. Most people usually don't care about whether you are a girl or not, unless you make it the core of your argument, which is what you did here. Because you responded the way that you did, you got flamed for it as a response. It would be the same if it were a different subject.\n\nNot only that, you kept mentioning it, and you got very toxic about it, as well as other things.\n\nMy advice to you is to ignore it. Literally pay no mind to it. You don't have to go on a rant about being a girl gamer. You don't have to mention it at all. Ever. Especially in the context that you did, which only invited more flame and trolling than it did to solve the problem. \n\nThere are many many many gaming communities which could care less if you're a girl or not. If you're in a group of friends that will harass you about it, then you need to find another group of people that wont.\n\nEDIT: You don't really have a case here. You brought the problem on yourself from the looks of it. It's more you're fault in that you chose to respond to it and make it known.","replies":[{"poster":"rujitra","date":"2019-12-06T23:48:23.037+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"I agree with this - only thing I'll add is that if the OP is going to reference irrelevant \"facts\" about lawsuits, at least be correct with them.

What people care about is people trying to use identity to get other people in trouble.\n\nSomeone offended you? Fine. Mute them so you don't have to put up with it any more and report them so other people don't have to.  There are people who will say or do things for the sole purpose of baiting others into ban-worthy behavior.  You have a choice to ignore them or join them.

It was an internal company issue, and had no relation to (and consequently no effect on) the punishment system in-game.\n\nSecond, you're going to have to explain what you mean by all of the above \"allowing further discrimination against disabled women\", because I seriously don't understand how any of those things relate.\n\n> please note i played a norms one game and in that game i was reported with a 25 chat restrict\n> lets face it no profanity...\n\nYou don't need to use profanity to break the rules. In point of fact, profanity is allowed, so long as it's within reason and not levelled to harass or insult other players.\n\n> ...and a whole game where morg rage quit lane on one death she blamed me for\n\nOther people misbehaving does not exempt you from the rules.\n\n> this is sad riot needs to have an option where i can remove chat from the interface or a mute all button so i dont have to inconveintly mute everyone individually each and every game phew\n\nThey recently added the Disable Allied Chat feature (which if I'm not mistaken, also disables your ability to chat wholesale, but don't quote me on that), and they've had the /muteall command for a while now.\n\n> i cannot show you what the x9 enemy team said as my team was against me and the enemy was too i cant show you how much their logic did not stack up\n\nTheir chat is not included in your chat logs because you were punished exclusively for your own behavior, and nobody else's. Whether they were 9x, 4x, or what have you, it doesn't matter; if you didn't break the rules, you would not have been punished.\n\n> and just what is negativity on your reform card...\n\nWell, let's see just what your chat logs entailed, shall we?\n\n> RikutoXÍ: ur reported jungler\nRikutoXÍ: xayah is at 10 percent enjoy report ekko\nRikutoXÍ: a free kill and ekko wont gank\nRikutoXÍ: so am i\nRikutoXÍ: if ekko wont gank its over\nRikutoXÍ: why doesnt jungle gank bot like they used to in season 4\n\nThree lines in and you start harassing your jungler, immediately threatening reports and complaining when they didn't gank you.\n\n> RikutoXÍ: this is why riot lost a class action lawsuit\nRikutoXÍ: as a women ur being toxic to me\nRikutoXÍ: riot can get sued for allowing you to bully me\nRikutoXÍ: us women won one court case\nRikutoXÍ: and riot is not above getting dragged into court\nRikutoXÍ: ur a woman hater\nRikutoXÍ: ima report you for being discrimiatinfg against women\nRikutoXÍ: my support is upset im a girl gamer and is flaming me\nRikutoXÍ: no wonder girls dont play this game riot discrimantes and allows u to flame and bully us girl gamers\nRikutoXÍ: its sad my team is flaming me for being a girl i died once and morg rage quit\nRikutoXÍ: please report morg\n\n...And then you make it into a completely pointless argument about gender. Literally, nobody knows whether you're a girl or not, and even then, you have your information entirely wrong.\n\n**_The lawsuit happened due to internal misconduct by Riot employees. It had nothing to do with in-game player behavior._**\n\n> RikutoXÍ: i have no support and ulted to wave cleart and my summs arne t an excuse to flame im silver elo\nRikutoXÍ: guess everybody is against me whatever ill win next game\nRikutoXÍ: calling me a degenerate okay bcuz riot is okay with that\nRikutoXÍ: im so held back this game im so much stronger than this\nRikutoXÍ: ill come back late game\nRikutoXÍ: thats whhat you want every1 to belive but im better thaan you morg\nRikutoXÍ: bcuz if i come back everyone will relize ur being a meanie\nRikutoXÍ: I HAVE HAD NO SUPPORT ALL GAME YOU RAGE QUIT MY LANE KID\nRikutoXÍ: TO GET VISION\nRikutoXÍ: UR SO RTOXIC\nRikutoXÍ: I WENT FOR SCUTTLE SHOWS HOW MUCH YOU CAN PAY ATT TO MAP\n\nAnd the detrimental argument continues up towards the very end of the match. You harassed your Jungler early on, then spent much of the rest of the game harassing Morgana and pursuing unnecessary arguments that detracted from the game. That kind of misbehavior would certainly warrant a punishment.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-12-06T23:13:30.951+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> after losing a lawsuit riot then proceeds to not correct its suspenion and reporting button and chat being optional to the point of allowing further discrimination against disabled women who game\n\nWhat the fuck does this have to do with you getting banned for extreme toxicity?","replies":[]},{"poster":"zPOOPz","date":"2019-12-06T23:12:44.598+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> RikutoXÍ: as a women ur being toxic to me\n\nIf you're going to willy nilly bring this attention to yourself, why cry about the attention you get afterward?
