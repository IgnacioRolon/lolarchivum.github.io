This doesn't happen when I play any other game. Both my main account and smurf now have 20+ leaver buster. I don't have time to reconnect after it happens because my computer requires a hard reset and then when I try to re-connect its been around 3 min and they have already voted to remake.. is there any solution? is there any way to get these accounts off leaver buster? I have spent a lot of money on these accounts. If there is nothing I can do I don't think ill play this game ever again.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-15T22:30:06.867+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The buzzing sounds and freezing has been happening to a few players, and the culprit appears to be the [Xbox Game Bar](http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8637-game-bar-turn-off-windows-10-a.html).
