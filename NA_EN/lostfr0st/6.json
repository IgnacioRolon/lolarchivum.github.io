This mode allows you to use locked mode, but you can offset where the lock is placed. This is especially useful during laning phase and is my personal favourite camera mode. Since you're not digging it, you can simply change to another camera mode in your settings. \n\nHere's a screenshot of where the setting is (click to enlarge it).\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/bIPNFSl.png\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[{"poster":"LostFr0st","date":"2016-07-13T20:29:45.207+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you very much for the clear reply.\n\nSpace bar just started acting weird a few patches ago :/\n\nI never used to try to move my camera while holding space I guess.\nI'm getting used to it now and it seems useful,\nbut was just wondering if that's what its intended behaviour was.\n\nI'll have a lot of fun now that I know I have full power on the lock^^\n\nSo, for reference: per-side offset and fixed offset both put it back the way it was before?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-07-13T21:02:40.803+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Per-side offset is the default camera setting, so I'd imagine that's what you were using before.
