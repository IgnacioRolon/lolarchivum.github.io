Such blocking is a common countermeasure against malware abusing infected machines for generating spam. Your ISP likely provides a specific mail server that is permitted. Also, webmail services remain unaffected.\nDirect TCP access to remote DNS servers (port 53) is allowed. \nDirect TCP access to remote HTTP servers (port 80) is allowed. \nDirect TCP access to remote POP3 servers (port 110) is allowed. \nDirect TCP access to remote RPC servers (port 135) is allowed. \nDirect TCP access to remote NetBIOS servers (port 139) is allowed. \nDirect TCP access to remote IMAP servers (port 143) is allowed. \nDirect TCP access to remote SNMP servers (port 161) is allowed. \nDirect TCP access to remote HTTPS servers (port 443) is allowed. \nDirect TCP access to remote SMB servers (port 445) is allowed. \nDirect TCP access to remote SMTP/SSL servers (port 465) is allowed. \nDirect TCP access to remote secure IMAP servers (port 585) is allowed. \nDirect TCP access to remote authenticated SMTP servers (port 587) is allowed. \nDirect TCP access to remote IMAP/SSL servers (port 993) is allowed. \nDirect TCP access to remote POP/SSL servers (port 995) is allowed. \nDirect TCP access to remote OpenVPN servers (port 1194) is blocked. \nDirect TCP access to remote PPTP Control servers (port 1723) is allowed. \nDirect TCP access to remote SIP servers (port 5060) is allowed. \nDirect TCP access to remote BitTorrent servers (port 6881) is blocked. \nDirect TCP access to remote TOR servers (port 9001) is blocked. \nUDP connectivity (?): OK +     \nTraceroute (?): OK +     \nPath MTU (?): OK +     \nHidden Proxy Detection (?): OK +      \nNetwork Access Link Properties +    –   \nNetwork performance (?): Latency: 64 ms, Loss: 14.5% – \nThe round-trip time (RTT) between your computer and our server is 64 ms, which is good. \nWe recorded a packet loss of 14%. This loss is very significant and will lead to serious performance problems. It could be due either to very high load on our servers due to a large number of visitors, or problems in your network. Of the packet loss, at least 14.5% of the packets appear to have been lost on the path from your computer to our servers. \nTCP connection setup latency (?): 65ms +     \nBackground measurement of network health (?): no transient outages +     \nNetwork bandwidth (?): Upload 2.1 Mbit/s, Download 14 Mbit/s +     \nNetwork buffer measurements (?): Uplink 340 ms, Downlink 77 ms +      \nHTTP Tests +     –  \nAddress-based HTTP proxy detection (?): OK +     \nContent-based HTTP proxy detection (?): OK +     \nHTTP proxy detection via malformed requests (?): OK +     \nFiletype-based filtering (?): OK +     \nHTTP caching behavior (?): OK +     \nJavaScript-based tests (?): OK +     \nSensitive proxy-introduced HTTP headers (?): OK +      \nDNS Tests +     –  \nRestricted domain DNS lookup (?): OK +     \nUnrestricted domain DNS lookup (?): OK +     \nDNS resolver address (?): OK +     \nDNS resolver properties (?): Lookup latency 150 ms +     \nInternal Server Error on Test Report \nDNS glue policy (?): OK +     \nport sequence plot\nDNS resolver port randomization (?): OK +     \nDNS lookups of popular domains (?): OK +     \nDNS external proxy (?): OK +     \nDNS results wildcarding (?): OK +     \nDNS-level redirection of specific sites (?): OK +     \nDirect probing of DNS roots (?): OK +      \nIPv6 Tests +    –   \nDNS support for IPv6 (?): OK +     \nIPv4, IPv6, and your web browser (?): IPv6 connectivity problem – \nYour browser successfully fetched a test image from our IPv6 server. Unfortunately, this is substantially slower than IPv4: it took 4.1 seconds longer to fetch the image over IPv6 compared to IPv4. Your browser prefers IPv4 over IPv6. \nIPv6 connectivity (?): OK +     \nIPv6 TCP connectivity (?): OK +     \nIPv6 Path MTU (?): Warning – \nYour system can send and receive fragmented traffic with IPv6.
