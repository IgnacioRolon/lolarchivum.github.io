We want to enforce players to not use 3rd party programs because we want to keep the integrity of the game. Upon investigating further, we feel that the ban was fairly placed.\n\nI wish that I could go into more detail about it, but for the sake of our protection and security, I cannot. Players like to write in and figure out why they were banned and use that information to prevent getting caught again; so we try to limit that as much as possible.\n\nI know it really sucks and I truly wish I could do more here.
