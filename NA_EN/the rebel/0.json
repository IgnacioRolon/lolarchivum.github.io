League simply refuses to start a game and instantly pops up with bug splat whenever I get into the loading screen (I lost about 30 lp after disconnecting from a ranked game.)  I've repaired and reinstalled my client at least twice now and I've updated all my drivers too but to no avail. Please, for the love of god, sort this problem out, Riot. I'm clearly not the only one who is having this problem after your latest patch.\r\n\r\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}}","replies":[{"poster":"The Rebel","date":"2016-11-01T10:33:51.819+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I tried looking through the guide yesterday and even tried again this morning but nothing works. My computer is brand new, not even a few months old and League was working perfectly fine last week. It only started to crash after leaving champ select after the client had decided to have a small patch when I logged back in yesterday. Even when I click reconnect for the any game I start, Bug Splat will just pop up again. All my other games work perfectly fine on my computer and League only decided to act up yesterday after a small patch. I just wanted to climb into gold. :(","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-31T22:35:01.828+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since patches only change local files inside your League directory, they're *very unlikely* to cause things like bugsplats, which are often influenced by poor driver interactions or hardware issues. I strongly suggest working through our [Bugsplat Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes), as it commonly resolves these issues.\n\nLet me know if this helped.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Akaterina","date":"2016-10-31T21:06:02.279+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah same.
