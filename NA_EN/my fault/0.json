Every time I try to play a game, within several minutes of the start of the game, my internet will slow down significantly, to the point where I either straight up get the \"attempting to reconnect\" message or my character just stays frozen on the screen. The slowness of the internet not only applies to the game, but my pc as a whole and even TV and other electronics that are reliant on the internet. Soon after I close the league client, the slowness subsides and everything is back to normal, until I try to play again. This issue is affecting my game plays quite a bit and I am sure that it is not the problem of my internet provider (Verizon), because on a day where I do not open the client once, my internet works perfectly fine. And yes, the problem exists both on wired and wireless connections. I also tried using a friend's internet, and the same problem persists. I hope that I have provided enough information on my issue and will get a quick and simple solution in your response.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-19T03:36:30.619+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmm it's kinda odd that your entire internet would slow down with the client open, but it kinda of makes me think it could be your pc processing slowing down instead of just the internet speed? Do me a favor and try doing a clean boot to see if your pc still lags without any other programs running.\n\nIf it stills lags even with a clean boot, there might be something causing some kind of block with your connection only when connected with our servers. Try running a traceroute to 104.160.131.1 with a tool like [WinMTR](http://winmtr.net/winmtr-v0-92-now-available/) and post the results here so I can take a look.\n\nPS: Sorry for the slower reply for this post! I had to reach out to a few people to talk about what things might be going wrong to cause something like this is all ^_^!
