When I go to the item sets to make one, I can get the set saved but I cannot actually add items to the set. It will allow me to drag icons but it doesn't save the item to the set or show up in game. In game there is only a blank item set. Anyone know a solution?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-11T23:51:27.881+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you able to edit changes on existing item sets?

At the moment, the only workaround is to edit or create item sets on another computer that *isn't* running macOS Sierra. Since your item sets are saved on the server, you should see those changes on your Mac.","replies":[{"poster":"Reddin","date":"2017-02-14T15:54:59.994+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This was 4 months ago and I am still having this problem.
