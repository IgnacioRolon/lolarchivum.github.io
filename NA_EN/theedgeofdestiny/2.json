With following steps taken:\n1. I navigate to Nexus\n2. Click on \"XX comments\" button to expand comments\n3. Click on \"LOG IN TO COMMENT\"\n4. Enter sign-in information (ignoring autofill and remembered password)\n5. Navigate to Nexus again\n6. Expand comments\n7. See that you still cannot comment (\"log in to comment\" appears instead of input textarea).\nIf I press \"login to comment\" this time -> I will be redirected to authorization form and then immediately (without entering credentials second time) -> redirected to nexus with no possibility to comment again","replies":[]}]}]}
