When you posted on the boards it was mostly about reporting the players I'm assuming, which would have been best handled by reporting them or hitting us up in a ticket. \n\nWhen you sent the ticket however, you focused on the Xerath issue, which is best posted in the Gameplay or Report a Bug boards.","replies":[{"poster":"TheEdgeOfDestiny","date":"2017-04-17T12:09:02.271+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for supporting.\n\nOriginal boards post had the same sense. The only misconception could have come from attached image which featured a screenshot of a player saying that not all his accounts are banned but only those that were featured in videos.\nI assume Riot bans players based on precedent - reported using ingame reporting system, reported through support by linking a video, etc. I am a programmer so an idea came to my mind. There are metrics (like KDA or damaged made to minions with autos) that can be used to extract lists of players that presumably use exploit, check and ban them.\n\nOriginal post from \"General Discussion\":\n> I feel some of them will be using proxies/vpns so it will be unreliant to ban accounts by IP.\nBut you can extract a list of accounts that have unrealistic KDA and some other metric and ban them.\nAt least hackers won't feel safe or would have a more difficult life with trying to fake to pass the check.\n\n> In the end it's just a bunch of ordinary people (users) and only one/couple people that developed the hack.\nI mean:\n-their numbers are limited\n-ordinary people won't feel as safe after their other accounts would be disabled\n\nP.S.:\nLooks like the issue was names not being hidden in chat screenshot. I didn't think about that since post wasn't focused on player behavior also mod didn't mention it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"LostFr0st","date":"2017-04-16T22:14:44.773+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"More than fairly sure it should be player support.\nTry linking the boards message in your ticket.","replies":[]}]}
