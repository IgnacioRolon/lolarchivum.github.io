Under any circumstances do not say anything which could be classed as BM to friends even if it is a 5 man and a joke as you will still receive punishments because Riot don&#039;t care about context or reasoning. \r\n\r\nWhich I learned the hard way by getting banned for 15 days for calling my friend a f*g also don&#039;t report each other as a joke because you will end up banned and be without season rewards.\r\n\r\nAnd do not expect support to do anything because it is treat like any other case and will not be reverted. So stay non-toxic and keep the chat clean at all times","replies":[{"poster":"Chermorg","date":"2017-11-06T19:45:34.098+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot has removed suspensions where things were said in team chat in 5 man premades and each person of the premade affirms (either here or in a support ticket) that they were okay with the behavior and that they rescind any \"troll\" reports they sent.
