Honestly I only own 1 champion right now and it's Jinx, but when I rerolled 3 skin shards I got a skin permanent for Fiora and it is just sitting there and I have the option to reroll it again with 2 more skin shards. Is this how it is supposed to work?","replies":[{"poster":"BubblyRainbows","date":"2017-08-09T08:44:15.367+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You only get a skin you don't already own. Not necessarily for a champ you own. If it was a guaranteed skin for a champ you own, people could cheat the system by unlocking only one champ, trading shards until they had all the rarest skins for that champ (for example, unlock annie, then reroll skins until you unlock the Hextech Skin that normally costs 10 gemstones), then unlock another, etc. So of course Riot isn't going to allow that sort of exploitation.\n\nThe plus side? The skin you got is permanently unlockable the moment you own the champ. It's not a skin shard, it's the full skin. I got a Twitch skin by rerolling this way, and that's why I unlocked Twitch. Once you unlock Fiora, you can just go into your loot and click \"unlock permanently\" on the skin. No essence cost or anything.","replies":[{"poster":"HyeJinx","date":"2017-08-10T17:35:58.781+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, that's kind of a bummer but it is what it is.

Why not just make it so you must own 20 champions or else the skin permanent will be random? \nFor example, if you own 20+ champions you are guaranteed a skin for a champ you own. \nIf you have less than 20 champions, it will default to the current system of giving you a 100% random skin (include a warning \"You own less than 20 champions! Re-rolling will result in a random skin not guaranteed for a champion you own. Are you sure you wish to continue?\")","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"√êavy Jones","date":"2017-08-09T04:26:47.721+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's how it's worked for me, which is kind of dumb in my opinion.","replies":[]}]}
