The only problem is, F12 is the default screenshot key, a feature I have no interest in.\n\nIs there anything I can change (In the input file perhaps) that will effectively unbind it? I've tried adding evtMakeScreenShot = [], both under [GameEvents] and [HUDEvents] with no success. Is there any fix for this? It's really inconvenient.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-16T22:01:12.387+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because F12 is hardbound (much like the ESC key), it's going to be fairly difficult (if even possible) to make it work.\n\nI strongly recommend against modifying the key in your input file, as it could break things, but if you end up in trouble and need to reset your inputs, let me know and I'll be happy to help.","replies":[{"poster":"Terror Jr","date":"2016-08-17T00:13:02.186+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Targons Blade,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=I4E38441,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-08-16T22:01:12.387+0000)\n>\n> Because F12 is hardbound (much like the ESC key), it&#x27;s going to be fairly difficult (if even possible) to make it work.\n> \n> I strongly recommend against modifying the key in your input file, as it could break things, but if you end up in trouble and need to reset your inputs, let me know and I&#x27;ll be happy to help.\n\nThat's pretty frustrating.
