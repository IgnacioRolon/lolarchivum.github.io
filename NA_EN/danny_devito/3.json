Then nerfing it another way that's not removing shield bash dmg versus champions (or something ranged targeted is done about the regen or on-hit dmg) .. could leave melee as sadcakes again for thinking this item really helps them.\n\nEven the tiniest sustain bonuses in lane compound on each other and ranged characters have the advantage of keeping out of reach and viability with warlord's bloodlust. Grasp and Colluses exist I suppose but in my opinion they don't feel like powerful masteries for taking the lane and definitely don't have the bite of fervor as game goes on (and fervor now synergizes with lifesteal as normal AD which is maybe strong?). Ofc though masteries are gonna be different in the future.\n\n_I also wonder how doran's stacking belongs in the game in the future_. Considering DBlade is kept pretty average at best at a 450g cost to not benefit aggressive ranged laners too much and that DRing stacking just got trimmed aggressively for a solid reason imo (just hope stacking 2 is decent still..?) And that DShield stacking has never really been a thing but I think it should be compared to the others, even if its health and niche seems small and limited to champions like Mundo or Shyvana or a scared Renekton. I don't think doran's stacking should be reduced to \"grab one of each type you like everytime to round out your starting stats\" but if they become just \"only can get one ever but it's pretty strong\" they're then really just a delayed super rune or mastery you pick and sell in game then it become pretty tough to put an _option_ there if basic components have to compete with them. Could work though if taking the shield means you have to build into a real mana item or if taking a ring really allows the tank freedom to go into hp items. Maybe an attack speed Dorans could be done. Dare I say even a hybrid pen/assassin one\n\nI'm smelling a small item overhaul next season with the rune rework I bet! (personally if Dorans are one and done I would make mana/health beads big buffed but still cheap and in a few more common recipes to compensate some regen needs and make every ounce of gold getchya something on an early recall. I want to see these things in people's inventories laning lol)\n\nCould also look at it as DShield allows ranged carries to afford the more pressing fervor of battle spec more and that it really is just picking and choosing the strongest choices in the different systems. Which is how I operate just put the obviously strongest things together on my favored champions and it tends to work out for the best (especially for hybrid like champions who sometimes get away with funny unique things)","replies":[{"poster":"AMYS GRAVE","date":"2017-06-10T20:42:01.476+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> I feel like even at 450g there's a fair chance it'll still be too popular to build.\n\nIf they are sacrificing lifesteal and damage then who cares....

I'd kill to see a Trundle, or Poppy, or Sion again. There's a good 10-15 champs the \"tank update\" really hurt, and I'm just disappointed that hurt looks like it's going to continue.
