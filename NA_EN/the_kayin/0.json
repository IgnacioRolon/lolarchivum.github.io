Then I just make a legitimate report because of it and they move 1 step closer to punishment. Don't take insults personally... nobody plays perfectly every game, and theyd say it to anyone if your team ends up losing. They just wanna blame someone so the other people \"know\" that it's not their fault. I don't like being flamed during the game just cuz it's a distraction and affects my decision making. After game?
