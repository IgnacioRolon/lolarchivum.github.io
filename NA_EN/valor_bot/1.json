It's been happening for the past week or so, my FPS will just sporadically drop from around 90 to 10-20 and then come back up again. Seems to be most prevalent when there's a lot of fighting/combat going on in game. The only other time my FPS is known to drop a lot is when I play the Nexus Siege game mode.\n\nHere are my system specs:\n\n> Mac OS Sierra\nVersion 10.12.2\niMac, Late 2013\n2.9 GHz Intel Core i5 Processor\n8 GB 1600 MHz DDR3\nNVIDIA GeForce GT 750M 1024 MB\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated ^_^","replies":[{"poster":"TooAsianTooGood","date":"2017-01-23T20:40:01.300+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have you resolved your problem? I have had this problem since beta client update. Tried going back to legacy. Tried different drivers. I also know its the game because I play Overwatch on max settings and get 90fps. I have used gpu-z and noticed that when i play overwatch, my card is being used at 99% , when I play league. its at 30%","replies":[{"poster":"Valor Bot","date":"2017-01-23T22:06:51.093+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry, I don't have a fix :( it stopped lagging for me quite a while ago and is working fine now.
