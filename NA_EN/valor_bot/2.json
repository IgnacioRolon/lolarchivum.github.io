So you don't have anything like add blockers running, and I'm guessing you don't have FEK installed.  Is your smartphone an iphone?

The reason I ask all this is to determine if this is a local issue or something on our side, in which case you're best posting this on the[ boards feedback ](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/site-feedback)for the devs to investigate further.
