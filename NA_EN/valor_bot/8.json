There were several concerns that Ivern would end up looking like \"just another Maokai\" but you guys went ahead and nipped the problem in the bud (no pun intended) by giving him what is probably the most unique silhouette in the game.\n\nI don't know if this was done intentionally, but Ivern actually reminds me a lot of a circus performer on stilts. Giving his body this shape was a really creative (and honestly unexpected) way of distinguishing him from Mao and making him a very unique-looking character among the roster!\n\nWell done to you guys.","replies":[{"poster":"Wolfeur","date":"2016-09-20T21:44:46.830+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"Honestly, I was sure Riot wouldn't simply give us another \"dendroid\" without making him quite separate from the other.\n\nMaokai is a Treant, Ivern looks a lot more like an Ent.","replies":[{"poster":"Evewynn","date":"2016-09-21T00:25:22.611+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually, the terms \"Treant\" and \"Ent\" have no actual differences other than where they originated. \"Ent\" from the Lord of the Rings universe, and \"Treants\" likely a renamed adaptation of those same creatures into Dungeons and Dragons.\n\nAny differences in appearance or demeanor between the two would merely be personal interpretations, as opposed to generally/widely accepted beliefs.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"xWaters","date":"2016-09-21T02:24:37.860+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"He looks a lot better in the teaser.
