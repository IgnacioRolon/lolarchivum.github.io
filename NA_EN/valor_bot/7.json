They were formerly called Bruisers.\n\nBut does Quinn really have the survivability to justify her Fighter label?  Sure, she&#039;s good at 1v1s in the right hands, but this is in part due to her burst and blind, not her defenses. Methinks Assassin would be a more appropriate label for her secondary:\n\n> **Assassin**: A champion type whose forte is rapidly ambushing and slaying enemy champions. They have abilities that may include stealthing themselves or having a strong dash skill.\n\nQuinn&#039;s ult not only puts the player melee, but grants him/her a massive AS and MS boost, as well as a targeted dash to help Valor stick to his prey. Any squishy target that&#039;s out of position and isn&#039;t massively ahead of Quinn can very well find themselves 100-0ed in a swift flurry of feathers and claws.\n\nNot that it&#039;s a big deal, but I do think Assassin would be more fitting, as that is what her ultimate is good for.","replies":[{"poster":"RiotRepertoir","date":"2015-08-30T21:34:53.087+0000","up_votes":21,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agreed.

Some fighters, like {{champion:11}} or {{champion:114}}, aren't really that tanky, and {{champion:133}} fits the light fighter theme when she goes into melee form, as she's still more focused on DPS and extending her lifespan (mainly through her blind) than she is about laying down hard burst. Granted, she lacks the same kind of active defenses as Yi, Fiora or {{champion:157}} in melee form, and has more burst than the average marksman (especially against low-health targets), but doesn't quite fit the assassin model, particularly since her melee form lacks an escape of its own.
