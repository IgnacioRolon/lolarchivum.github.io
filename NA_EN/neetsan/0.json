The thing is, I just tried logging on a few minutes ago and I got a message saying that my account has been permanently suspended. It doesn&#039;t give a reason as to why I got banned or anything like that. It says that an email was sent to the address that&#039;s linked to my account but, so far, I haven&#039;t seen one. I&#039;ve looked around on some similar forum discussions so it seems like it&#039;s either a glitch of some kind or my account got hacked. Anyone have some suggestions or experiencing the same problem?","replies":[{"poster":"glev145","date":"2018-05-25T20:12:50.804+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"did riot cancel the ban after all? my friend got banned like that as well and im pretty sure he didnt do anything he has not got a single chat restriction or a draft ban before   {{sticker:zombie-brand-mindblown}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-03-15T04:36:49.119+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You checked the wrong email, most likely.","replies":[{"poster":"NEETsan","date":"2018-03-17T21:36:42.411+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nope, I checked all my emails.
