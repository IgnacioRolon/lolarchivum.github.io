This effect has no real impact on the game, however I have played A LOT of malzahar so it's really disappointing since I have looked a few times on what the issue was and with no luck or results I have 80k mastery on him.  Now he is getting updated and whatnot its still no different for me, the q special effect doesn't play on either my live or pbe account. Perhaps an issue with amd cards?? I would really love to know.\n\nEDIT: The title should specify \"EVEN while on max settings\" as in, even with everything maxed it wont play the effect.\n\n\nEDIT: http://pastebin.ca/3583405 my dxdiag","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-04-21T16:53:01.814+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"FTFY. \n\nI'm going to pass this along to the team to take a look at. :) Thanks for the report!","replies":[{"poster":"Scarabking","date":"2016-04-21T17:48:30.548+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Thanks so much!
