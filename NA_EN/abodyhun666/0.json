Sure, TSM is working with a new jungler, but so is UoL, not to mention the Santorin-Bjergsen synergy was so hyped up, plus TSM has a lot more experience playing professionally. UoL seem to be improving really really quickly.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"exiledFromBadmen","date":"2014-12-07T17:35:47.306+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea Unicorns of Love is a good team.\n\nhttp://herogamesworld.com/images/my%20little%20pony%20games.jpg","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rhlax","date":"2014-12-07T04:14:21.684+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"what a tournament so far... definitely an uol fan now.","replies":[]},{"poster":"skyfall619","date":"2014-12-07T03:19:31.190+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"tsm was outplayed from pick/bans all the way to the nexus.

It isn't even that they pull out off meta picks; it's that they're *really, really good*. I mean sure, Xerath got counterpicked and snowballed on hard, and Azir got put up against a very strong lane bully, but PowerofEvil just manhandled Bjergsen in mid lane all day. Always been a fan of teams that get a lot of carry potential from their other roles (not just ADC), and their teamwork is phenomenal. Just watching them play, there seems to be a level of trust and just innate synergy that you don't see in a lot of teams; watching them pick apart TSM, they seem to have come a long way since the promotional tournament.","replies":[{"poster":"AbodyHUN666","date":"2014-12-07T23:15:39.101+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even back then in the promotional tournaments when they lost games those games were very close ones.

That max range Syndra stun -> flash thread-the-needle Thresh hook -> flash+Wukong E+ult they pulled on Bjergsen was beautiful, and it was only one of the many plays they made where everyone just seemed perfectly in-sync. Their micromanagement with healthbars in teamfights is something I've only seen from like, top Korean teams and C9 when they're playing well (don't know too much about EU LCS)\n\nI dunno, maybe I'm just super hyping them up right now, but they're one of those teams that make the game exciting again, sort of like whenever Faker masters another champion and brings them into the meta.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"ZeroAnarchy","date":"2014-12-08T00:00:01.935+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I might only watch EU LCS just for them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tortferngatr","date":"2014-12-07T18:29:39.785+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"WHAT IS LOVE\nBABY DON'T HURT ME\nDON'T HURT ME\nNO MORE\n\nBut yeah, Unicorns of Love are amazing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"gubigubi","date":"2014-12-07T07:38:04.160+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ya unicorns of love did some work.
