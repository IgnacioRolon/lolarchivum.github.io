My screen goes black and I realize my computer is out of charge. I was at my friends house so I go back home to get a charger and reconnect back into the game. Fortunately, my team one the 3v3. I was playing Ryze. But I was majorly disappointed because I had received a LeaveBuster for 20min. This is dumb. I shouldn't be banned for something like this. I hope you can make changes in the future to your banning system.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-12T22:07:41.905+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know that your leaving wasn't intentional, but [leaverbuster](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ) penalties only apply after more than one leave and because leaving still causes negative experiences for others.  Hopefully, the black screen was simply a result of a charging issue and not something else.  If it still persists let me know, and I'd be happy to help!","replies":[{"poster":"shadowjoey","date":"2016-11-13T15:38:05.492+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hey this guy I met in a game actually started saying a bunch of really mean stuff to me in messedges after the game and I have no idea where to send this or who to send this to but like hes really toxic and bunch of other stuff and I wasn't able to report him because he only acted like this when the game was over. so idk what to do can I just send you the chat because I saved it in a file and everything so.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MatadorDeath","date":"2016-11-12T23:00:20.236+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ive payed so much on an account and i get banned in my opinion thats just alot of my money ive spent on it taken away.
