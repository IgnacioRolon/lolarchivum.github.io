Not only during the dash, he runs threw it and not around it if it was just used on a lane far before his dash.  Happened to me already a few times.\n2, the more anyong thing: If Kled dismounts, while he is in the Air, he can walk over the wall. I understadn that a Xayah or Fizz should be able to do that but Kled? Feels not realy fair if you have to go threw 2 healthbars and while cornering him with Ult and a wall after skaarl runs away he comes easily over the wall and escapes. Happened to me a few times also.","replies":[{"poster":"Muskiller","date":"2017-10-28T00:45:18.272+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He can go through walls if he gets close enough to an enemy","replies":[{"poster":"Häxel","date":"2017-10-28T16:23:14.769+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"why evertime i put this on discussion this comes up?
