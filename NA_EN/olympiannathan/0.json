Before preseason when I would play the game would run at around 200 fps, and now playing it runs between 40 and 80 fps. I haven't changed any settings or anything about my computer other than getting a new monitor, but I wouldn't think that would affect it. Is anyone else having this issue or know of a way to fix it besides turning quality settings down?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-27T01:33:30.148+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Let's make sure to run through the basics first before digging too deep and missing an easy fix of course. Double check that you've got the latest driver updates and that the Windows Game Bar/DVR features are still disabled. \n\nIf that's not helping at all, this might be related to how strong that new monitor is. League isn't quite fully supported for 4k just yet, and some higher end monitors can have frame skipping which might mean you need to have your fps capped to stop the stuttering.","replies":[{"poster":"Just a weeb xoxo","date":"2017-11-27T03:18:23.157+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's on your end, also the same problem.\nSince Patch it is laggy af. {{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}}","replies":[]}]}]}
