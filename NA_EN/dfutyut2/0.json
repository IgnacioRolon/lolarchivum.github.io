So I signed up for the Alpha Client pretty much when it was announced. I have yet to get a response while my friend who applied after me got in in no time flat. Are people that have been applied for ages now going to get any sort of response or are we all screwed in not being able to try it out before it goes Beta? I heard there might be a reward for those who used the Alpha Client. Seems unfair when Riot has not given a response to those who applied for awhile now.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-02T02:48:22.053+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The criteria we use for selecting Alpha testers isn't solely based on whoever first applied, and there could be a number of things we're looking for. Something that remains consistent is that we look for players who are really active and are a positive influence on the community.\n\nAdditionally, it's listed in our [Alpha Client FAQ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/206201070-Alpha-Client-FAQ) that we were initially looking for players with higher spec PC's to test the earlier builds of the Alpha Client. Let me know if you have any questions.","replies":[{"poster":"dfutyut2","date":"2016-11-02T16:17:43.659+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have a pretty high spec pc so I know that isn't the issue. I am active and I would like to think positive to the community. My friend can be really toxic and they got in so I do not think that is the case.

According to our [Alpha Client FAQ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/206201070-Alpha-Client-FAQ), this is not the case, as we'd prioritize PC's above minimum specs and players that fit the specific criteria our teams have requested for testers.\n\nI can't manually review your application, however, according to [this post](http://euw.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/client/client-features/client-update-alpha-ending-soon) the open beta is coming soon and you'll have a chance to use the new client then. Let me know if you have any other questions.","replies":[{"poster":"dfutyut2","date":"2016-11-03T05:26:52.620+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/E59uvEpE-league-of-legends-alpha-client?comment=000000000000\n\n\"cCc Grumbles cCc (NA) - 15 days ago\nWe've been inviting more players into the alpha but we still haven't invited everyone yet.

By far. And they can be really toxic in chat in League whereas I feel I am majority of the time positive. So I am not sure the criteria to get in from what you mentioned is 100% true. As for active, I have been playing since 2011 actively. I do not know how much more active I could possibly be. So yes, I do feel like I fit the criteria to join perfectly. And if there is some reward for being in the ALPHA, I think that is unfair to those who are positive and have high spec'ed PCs that did not get in.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-03T20:58:50.741+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately, I'm not on the team that decides the criteria for how Alpha Testers are chosen.
