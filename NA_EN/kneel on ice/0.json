Would love to see advancement of that plot-line myself though, more revelations about the Watchers and the history there especially.","replies":[{"poster":"lightdragoon88","date":"2015-12-13T23:07:17.893+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:127}} This place is where it happened. On one side, the Frozen Watchers, on the other, Avarosa and her Iceborn horde. Many Iceborn died that day, but in the end, the Watchers fell. Avarosa drove them howling into the abyss. I never forgave her. . . **I had my revenge â€” but that is another story.**\n\n\n\n\nI think I speak for many when I say we are hoping to hear that other story.","replies":[]},{"poster":"kneel on Ice","date":"2015-12-13T13:44:22.388+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Well thats sad news for Lissandra main :/","replies":[{"poster":"LVL 5 PORO","date":"2015-12-13T22:23:03.685+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think Lissandra is perfect right now! I thought she needed a new passive for a long time, but now I'm beginning to see that she doesn't. The ult heal really rounded her out. Against melee and assassins her passive allows her to sustain in lane much longer than other mages. It really accentuates her strength in early laning, but falls off later. At the bare minimum, maybe the cd on her passive could be reduced. But outside of that, shes flawless.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Transgressor","date":"2015-12-13T23:25:05.457+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"LEAVE HER ALONE.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"PentaDenier","date":"2015-12-13T01:35:41.895+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I find Lissandra to be fun and great in ARAM, but mediocre on Summoners Rift, her Q didn't need to be nerfed and she needs a new passive. She also is long overdue for some skins, and could use a visual update on her base skin and her Bloodstone skin, which isn't nearly as quality and detailed as her Blade Queen skin. I own both but would like a reason to use the Bloodstone skin from time to time.","replies":[]},{"poster":"EmittingXs","date":"2015-12-13T23:02:44.920+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Gameplay aside, we just need mroe information on what Lissandra is either up to what she is cooking up. Ashe becomes queen and she has a skin to prove it. cool. Lissandra and Sejuani do what now? Are they just sitting around waiting for something? What happens next? There should be some big event like what happened at Bilgewater but for the trio. Not necessarily an end to their story, just an advancement.\n\nAlso, could we get a teaser or something for a new skin for Lissandra Riot? Something that lets us know that you guys DO have a plan of sorts. I've got RP sitting in my account, just waiting for her next skin. Throw us a bone.

Can Riot PLEASE plan to update Lissandra? Sick and tired of getting steamrolled by just about every character. Lissandra isn't being played in ranked because Lissandra is not viable in ranked. PLEASE fix her in the next update. All the updates are always for OTHER players. NEVER Lissandra. Stop being unfair Riot.
