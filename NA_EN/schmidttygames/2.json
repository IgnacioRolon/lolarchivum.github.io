After a few minutes of waiting in a queue, I get this message.  In Draft Mode, it cancels my queue.  In regular modes, the clock will tick endlessly.  This is wholly frustrating and I have no reason why it happens.  This is the only game I play where this has ever been an issue, and I have only experienced one 10 second \"Attempting to Reconnect\" during a game.\r\n\r\nBut pre-game, it's everywhere.  I've seen only two Post-Game's live, ever, because this is what I get back instantly.\r\n\r\nIs there anything I can do about this?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-13T23:27:46.127+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This typically happens due to your connection to the game platform being unstable.

Nothing has worked.  It's interesting to note that I'll be in a queue with friends and I'll watch them leave the room, miss the queue, and get the connection timeout immediately afterwards.  It's entirely frustrating and I'm out of answers.\n\nI've bounced my head off of the wall that is this problem for 2 days to no avail.  With no further options left, and no idea what is causing this problem, I'm at a total loss as to what to do next.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-16T22:01:12.879+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I recommend running a set of system logs with our [Hextech Tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367), then attach them to a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).

I think I have narrowed it down to either a Firewall issue or a Router issue.  The Hextech Diagnostic tool told me that \"Everything was Okay\", but the problem persists.  When I have more information I will post it here, and I will continue to work to track down the problem.","replies":[]}]}
