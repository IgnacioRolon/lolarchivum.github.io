And it gets progressively worse and worse until I simply can't connect to server until the game ends. The entire time, my internet is working just fine and my ping never shows a change. It is about the only thing in this game that can actually tilt me, and it's a problem that I've concluded is not on my end.\r\n\r\nDuring my last game, I could ping my job.  I could ping Yahoo, MSN, GMail, even your website, and we had an XBox One on Live that had no inturruption 10 feet away from me, but I couldn't connect to the game server.  Every time this happens, it turns into an automatic loss and no doubt gets me reported for leaving games, and it's not something I can fix because everything on my end continues to run normally.  The only conclusion I can draw is that one of your host servers is busted.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-04T22:09:55.064+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You might have a weak or degrading connection that failing to keep you specifically communicating with the game server.
