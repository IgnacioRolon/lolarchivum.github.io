Since the last patch I have been having progressive Framerate issues on the Rift that seem to actually be getting worse.  I have narrowed it down to only League of Legends (as every other game I play/stream is working fine) and the Overwolf LOLWiz app that likes to record my games without my permission anyway.\r\n\r\nSo before I go on a massive uninstall/reinstall spree, I was wondering if there were any quiet changes to Leagues Settings that could possibly cause hiccups on mid to high end machines.  Particle changes, perhaps something I could turn off that makes life hard for graphics cards, ect.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\n\r\nSchmidtty","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-25T02:01:21.431+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Two things here jump out at me: you mentioned this taking place after a patch as well as using third party recording software. \n\nMost likely, this is probably happening due to the third party software eating up resources and interfering with League. I'd first suggest turning that off and testing it out. If that doesn't help, double check for any possible driver updates you might have missed, then go through the other steps in this [**FPS guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting).","replies":[]}]}
