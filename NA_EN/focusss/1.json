That will leave you with 170, still more than enough to poison the minion wave after and E to last hit for mana regen which at level 2 will be the 30 mana cost of your twin fang +11.7 from 3% boost +4 per kill from the doran ring.  \n\nWhile if you get all 6 Es off it will cost slightly more, all of 35 more, it doesn't suddenly cripple you like everyone is trying to say it does. Hell you could still Q and cast 4 more Es on the enemy laner before going oom which is more than enough to kill pretty much anyone in the game at that level.\n\n\n\n>You're crazy if you think it's an automatic 6 Es now, you won't get 6 and at most you'll land 1 more than before if any more. If you can land 6 now you would have landed 5 before. More realistically you'll land 3 now at low levels or 4 if they're going straight into you, in that case it would have been 3-4 before as well. They're not going to stand still and let you get off every E you can while your poison is ticking.\n\n>Your math is based on an imaginary scenario that doesn't exist.\n\n\nUm in the past it was impossible to land more than 3 Es because of how the resets worked.  It didn't reset until the E actually hit the target meaning you had to wait for the travel time and then you had to wait for the CD after it reset to .5 seconds.  This tended to mean the CD was 1 second between the travel time and the reset and only really changed if you where point blank range.  Now the CD resets to .5 instantly upon cast if the enemy target is poisened.  This means the ticker begins before the E has even dealt it's damage and without travel time that leaves the spell with a flat .5 CD which makes it more than possible to get 6 Es in if you position correctly and are smart casting.  I generally sit between 100-150 ping and I am consistently getting 5 Es in with each Q.  It isn't some imaginary scenario it's something people like Cobra and I, and I'm sure others who are not on these boards, are doing consistently because of how we position and play around her E spam play style.  We realize how much damage it really does vs how much other champs can do and take advantage of the fact that we are stronger than they are and punish those who don't respect it.  \n\nReally when you put it in context it makes sense why so many Diamonds show so much respect to Cobra in his videos.  Chances are they realized Cassio can out DPS them and that Cobra will punish them if they try to fight, vs players in Bronze/Silver/Gold who continue to think Cassio does zero damage and is trash and disrespect her while playing against Cassio's who feel the same way and allow themselves to be disrespected.  As long as you continue to insist that she is weak you will never realize just how strong she really is.  I've provided the numbers and the data to show that she does in fact win against pretty much anyone when played correctly, if you don't want to accept that and abuse players that disrespect you when playing her that is on you, not the champion.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot King Cobra","date":"2014-10-27T18:32:44.197+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> Um in the past it was impossible to land more than 3 Es because of how the resets worked.

And it isn't just true for me. There are/were plenty of replays of Voyboy destroying people with new Cassio midlane (there is a specific game that comes to mind where he is against a Fizz and ends the game like 13/2). Scarra was in the game playing support if it helps you find it (Scarra and Voy were both streaming so it may be in their VODs somewhere). \n\nAnd for those saying that you won't get the 5-6 Fangs in. You get them in the same amount of time that you previously got 2-3 in (which it sounds like nobody had trouble doing). And besides, if the opponent starts to back off, that's the whole point of the movement speed on Q...you can catch up to them and weave around whatever CC they throw at you. \n\n\nShe really truly isn't trash. Maybe she needs some fine tuning in the mana costs or the passive stacks but that's basically it balance wise. I can understand further changes to help with her \"identity\" (although I don't think it's really a problem since to me she didn't really change at all identity wise). Balance and playability wise, she's almost entirely OK.","replies":[{"poster":"Orbv","date":"2014-10-27T20:15:59.282+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've grown to not care about the stack idea if that is the only thing keeping her new e refresh.

I don't think it's fair that most people have to wait until 40 minutes to get to that late game power spike. \n\nI also am not a fan of the increased CD on Q. The 4 seconds feels awkward after playing her so much with 3 seconds. Also, since the Q delay increase went through as well, the skill feels a bit weird to actually use as well. I think something can be done here to make her early game at least FEEL not as bad. \n\n\nHer early game isn't really that bad though. If you were somebody who maxed Q then yeah, it's definitely weaker since you can't poke indefinitely due to Deadly Cadence. As somebody who worked around Twin Fang though, I find her early game pretty OK after you get a Tear (which I usually built anyways since I highly value Seraph's shield).","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Orbv","date":"2014-10-27T20:04:26.876+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You are only talking about ideal circumstances. Players are not phenomenal on Cass, you can't expect her to always hit as many fangs as possible. Her q does les damage, that alone hurts. She cannot attempt to poke a long range champ, they will never get in range of her. But you can't poke now because you're always levelling up E. Let's say you get the Q off, you need the speed boost just to reach your target to get a fang off. Every single one of cass's abilities cause her to stop. You will never get off 6 fangs if the person is backing up at all, you might not even get 3 off post rework cass because she keeps stopping. It is a big deal to get two fangs of without repercussions. \n\nA big part of Cass was to whittle your opponents down, then attack. You CANNOT fight another most mids at level 2. Nobody will allow you to just spam on top of them when most already out range her. Can't take on yasuo, ahri, syndra, zilean (sad), ziggs, xerath or Ori whose short cooldowns and shield/slow out do Cass.\n\nAlso her heal is horrible until around 700 AP. Any mage will kill you with the same build at that point.\n\nThey took away her strength in multiple places to buff one play style that requires you to be GREATER than your opponent buy a vast margin.

Its not about mashing the key as fast as possible its about positioning and orb walking in between Es.  Everytime you cast an E you should immediately click to move toward your opponent and press E again as soon as its up.  It isn't hard to do, its only slightly more intensive than the orb walking most ADC and melee champs do.  Frankly its what you should be doing on every champ whether you are AAing or casting spells.  If you are doing it there is really no reason for you to not land +3 Es on your target per Q.\n\nAs for the champs you mentioned yeah Syndra/Ziggs are good against cass, so are Xerith and Azir.  The others you mentioned not so much.  Yasuo can be strong if he avoids your poison with his E but if you tag him once he will either W and back off or die from the E spam.  Zilien is extremely easy especially if he tries to double bomb you at level 2, you just Q him while he goes through his cast animation and proceed to melt him out of the lane.  Orianna can safe farm against Cass some what but she can't go aggressive unless cass makes a big mistake because Cass does so much more single target damage than her at pretty much all stages of the game its kinda silly.\n\nCassio doesn't require some kind of godlike degree of skill that so many of you keep saying.

Yes, numerically Cassi post rework does have a higher damage potential, but the thing is that its damage *potential*, meaning it won't always happen. Most times you're going to get 3 or maybe 4 Twin Fangs off in any spell rotation. Why? Because people aren't going to sit there and let you hit them. They're going to either run away or they're going to burst you harder. Heaven forbid you use Twin Fang during a lapse in poisons, because that spell is going on cooldown, and there goes all of your damage output.

Cassio actually does comparable damage to her old self, being all of 16 damage short with 3 Es like before and significantly out damaging her old self at every E past that point.  Saying her damage is so low that she can't fight anyone in the early game is just flat out wrong considering no other champ in this game at level 2 is capable of putting out over 500 damage on their own in 3 seconds like Cassio can.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Focusss","date":"2014-10-26T19:32:04.390+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"plz upvote so more people can see this since you cant bump threads anymore","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cute Vegan Boy","date":"2014-10-26T18:51:33.539+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I respect the Twin Fang aspect of this, but not the ult, as it would be kind of broken.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Creamy Seaman","date":"2014-10-27T18:39:58.202+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"She is basically a harder to play teemo and even more cancerous.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ceaselessphantom","date":"2014-10-27T03:46:41.985+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree on the ult with no delay.
