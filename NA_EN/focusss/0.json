After I killed him the first time he said \"nice play\". A couple minutes later he ulted me and I ulted his face then I killed him. He instantly accused me of scripting because he was plat and he was better then me. Eventually his team started to believe it because I was something like 19-9-8 with cass. he was asking me what tear I was and stuff and all that crap because he said he was much better then me. Being the jackass I was I said cardboard I (im actually unranked), and he didn't like answer I gave him so he told me I was going to get reported for scripting. when I died a couple of times he said \"turned off that script I see\". after awhile it just gets annoying. I just find it hard to believe I cant play my favorite champ just because im too scared of assholes like him that will report me for \"scripting\" **this is not the first time this has happened to me either**.\r\n\r\nNote: Im definitely not a great Cassiopeia but she is the only champion I play consistently along with swain.","replies":[{"poster":"CheckMyDoubles","date":"2015-01-16T03:05:19.183+0000","up_votes":52,"down_votes":1,"body":"Empty threats from a raging \"pro\" Zed.
