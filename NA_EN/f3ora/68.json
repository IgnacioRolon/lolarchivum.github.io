Zed&#039;s ult would still rip her up.  Garen still countered her. \r\nRaamus countered her among others but you weren&#039;t happy.\r\n\r\nYou only way to become a better player was to destroy my main to target me personally for being better than all of you.\r\n\r\nThat&#039;s right...\r\n\r\nYou might think me delusional but Riot banned me from ranked at the exact same time of the Fiora rework.\r\nNot because I was bad or misbehaved but because I was too good and they didn&#039;t understand it.\r\n\r\nWho get&#039;s banned from ranked alone?   Not many people get that.\r\nIt was a message to me that my days owning you guys are over.\r\n\r\nThey want me to go home so they destroyed the 1st E-sport to pick on me. \r\n\r\nShame on you Riot.\r\n\r\nJust because I can beat all your LCS players doesn&#039;t mean you should destroy the game to pigeon hole me.\r\n\r\nIt&#039;s not even as much about her ult as it is her double lunge.\r\n\r\nFiora&#039;s double lunge is what makes Fiora...  Fiora Riot. \r\n\r\nYou put a timer on it and gave her a plecebo ult destroying the champ. \r\n\r\nMaybe the rest of the build is cool but you certainly destroyed Fiora and ruined the 1st e-sport.","replies":[{"poster":"BeatzBoyFTW","date":"2017-02-04T12:58:06.191+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Or you can just admit that you suck with current Fiora.
