Thus, the obvious conclusion is that you are purposefully trying to annoy people and get emotional responses from them - aka trolling.\n\nThen again I checked your op.gg and its possible that you're just really really really new at the game - but since you're apparently better than the best pro players my own conclusions has to be that you are intentionally losing games and playing badly, which only makes it even more liekly that you're the kind of person to troll the forums.\n\nTLDR: You're trying to hard to trigger people and it makes it obvious.
