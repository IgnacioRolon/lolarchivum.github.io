They are too arrogant to see the Fiora rework as a mistake\r\nB. They are too ignorant to understand that the Fiora rework was a mistake. \r\nC. They wanted her to be bad and to become a useless champion. \r\nD. They wanted to upset me personally banning me from ranked, to destroy my champion and feel no remorse. \r\nE. They got owned by Fiora test playing the game and never want a real challenge again. \r\nF. Because they want the entire Fiora loving community to suffer in darkness. \r\nG. Because they secretly want to sabotage the 1st E-sport.\r\nH. Because they don&#039;t like code. \r\nI. Because they forgot how to change Fiora back. \r\nJ. Because Fiora gives them nightmares. \r\nK. Because Fiora sounded arrogant so they wanted her to pay with a placebo ult and she isn&#039;t finished paying. \r\nL. Because Riot has more important things to do than cater to old Fiora mains. \r\nM. Because they can&#039;t stop farting whenever they try to bring the old Fiora back.\r\nN. When they try to change to back she has a glitch that destroys all other champs. \r\nO. After they bring back the old Fiora she comes out of the screen and tries to slash everyone responsible. \r\nP. When you bring back the old Fiora all the nuclear weapons around the World go live. \r\nQ. Caring about how people really feel about Fiora gives the developers angina pain.\r\nR. Remembering how amazing the old Fiora is puts the developers in a day dream stupor and are unable to work. \r\nS. The old Fiora reminds the developers of a conceited X-girlfriend who they hate.\r\nT. The developers are too lazy to fix the game from smoking so much weed. \r\nU. Riot got jealous and remains jealous of how much better she was than their mains that they have no intention of fixing her. \r\nV. Riot doesn&#039;t want to see me get a level 1 pentakill ever again.\r\nW. When Riot thinks about Fiora little mini Fioras start coming out of the floor to taunt them. \r\nX. Fiora&#039;s family called and said they won&#039;t pay the ransom money. \r\nY. The new Fiora has a big fit and starts breaking stuff. \r\nZ. All the developers have turned into clones of Tahm Kench.","replies":[{"poster":"Shad√≤w","date":"2016-10-08T15:30:05.580+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"her rework is fine wtf.\n\nshe was OP when it first came out, but she is in a fine spot now.","replies":[{"poster":"F3ORA","date":"2016-10-08T15:33:33.804+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":10,"body":"You should of voted.
