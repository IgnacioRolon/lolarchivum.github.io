Her gameplay was made to be much healthier though.\n\n>My main complaints is that her Lunge and her ultimate are totally different.\n\nWow, instead of a point and click that could be cast twice if the first hit it is a semi-targetted that refunds most of the CD if it hits.  So different, definitely not strong now that you can jump walls with it.\n\nHer ult was also an incredibly toxic and unfair ability to play against.  There wasn't any counterplay to it.\n\n>Fiora's lunge and her ultimate were what made Fiora... Fiora.\n\nLunge is still pretty much the same, ult is different but far healthier.\n\n>Everyone who down voted me and everyone who likes the new Fiora better doesn't play Fiora like I do.\n\nYou are right, we play Fiora.  You play a dream of what Fiora used to be.\n\n>I have more games with Fiora than all of you combined.\n\nNo you don't.  Looking at your profile you have barely 10% of the mastery points of ImCreepingDeath on Fiora.\n\n>I am the World's best Fiora.

It also made a lot of other people start playing her.\n\n>It wasn't just a new skin to us who actually play her.\n\nCorrect, it was an update, not a new skin.\n\n>You ruined the game and it will always be ruined until you change it back.\n\nConsidering new Fiora is healthier for the game I don't think that it ruined the game.","replies":[{"poster":"F3ORA","date":"2017-03-21T20:11:22.359+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"You are wrong about most of this.","replies":[]},{"poster":"F3ORA","date":"2017-03-21T20:04:45.517+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"The death of the 1st E-sport is healthy for the game?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"dolphinosplash24","date":"2017-03-21T17:30:35.677+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"> \n> I have more games with Fiora than all of you combined. \n> \n\nNo you dont.
