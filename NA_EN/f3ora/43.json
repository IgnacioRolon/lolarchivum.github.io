As if they&#039;ve been playing the part of their twin sister. \r\n\r\nSince she is basically a different champ. \r\n\r\nIt&#039;s a creative idea that only adds to the game. \r\n\r\nI don&#039;t think you can refuse.","replies":[{"poster":"LadyRenly","date":"2016-06-12T19:18:54.139+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"i am sorry to hear of your condition. but if riot caved in to near death pleas, zed teemo and yasuo would have been deleted already","replies":[]},{"poster":"Weiner the Pooh","date":"2016-06-12T19:15:36.004+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I remember riot saying something along the lines of her old ult was potent that they turned it into her whole kit, basically her whole kit is a taken apart blade waltz that is supposed to be like the original when synced together.","replies":[]}]}
