RIP Fiora...","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":4,"down_votes":21,"body":"RIP E-sports.\r\n\r\nYou will be missed.\r\n\r\nI think the Fiora rework made competitive gaming sour for everyone who is serious about it. \r\n\r\nRIP Fiora...  Your ultimate was amazing. \r\n\r\nYou were the greatest champion of all time.\r\n\r\nYour double lunge and level 1 pentakills will be missed.\r\n\r\nYour speed at breaking turrets was second to none.\r\n\r\nSince Riot kidnapped the real champ and replaced her with a clone who plays nothing like her with the same name I have cried the tears that make the river of summoners rift. But the river will not bring Fiora back from the dead.\r\n\r\nOnly callous computer programmers can. \r\n\r\nAnd I don&#039;t see that happening any time soon considering how pompous they are. \r\n\r\nThey don&#039;t care about Fiora...\r\n\r\nNobody does but me.  \r\n\r\nYou can talk about her to people who actually play the game instead of frequent the message boards instead all day. \r\n\r\nThey say they are sad for her loss.\r\n\r\nI am so sad I cry every day.\r\n\r\nI wish crying could bring her back.","replies":[{"poster":"KnightsKemplar","date":"2017-06-16T23:36:24.238+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey F3ORA,\n\nI'm gonna lock up this thread.
