They probably also hate Fiora.  Does Riot really hate Fiora that much?

Nobody likes it on vanye and that ain't no different here.\n\n2) her w. Negates ALL champion damage, cc and if it negates a immobilizing cc such as a stun or root it stuns who ever gets hits.\n\n3) As a result of the prior two things. She's one of the best duelist who when played right has almost no true counter. \n\nHer only weaknesses are primarily in her team fight capability since she can only target one opponent at a time and has no real defense against cc chaining once her w is down but during the laning phase she is almost unstoppable in the right hands","replies":[]}]}
