Granted i did kill a few enemies including a ekko with my Q(BOOOOOTA CALL JOKES EVERYWHERE! xD), If games had proper balance where the matches lasted much longer and snowballs were less of a thing to actually pull off (aka huge risk that could cause a massive turn over against snowball based teams rather easily), then i'm sure plenty of people would stop dodging and surrendering so fast.\n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]}]}]}
