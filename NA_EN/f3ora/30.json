This game now requires your team to also be good to get ahead.\r\n\r\nIf the cards aren't in your favor there is no way unless you have a friend who is good.","replies":[{"poster":"VesperNadal","date":"2017-04-25T04:37:44.329+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've found the best traits to climb out of  Bronze is to be likable and persuasive. Since Bronze is just a bunch of misfits you have to work at getting them to work together towards a common goal. You will not get everyone on board with you. But if you can get more people to act cohesively than the other team can, you have a greater chance of winning.\n\nStuff that works:\nJoking\nAdmitting when you're wrong\nForgiving them for their mistakes\nPep-talks\nShowing them how to properly do something\nPredicting something happening but not gloating if you get it right\nMaking an impressive play\nNot ridiculing someone for going off meta\n\nYou will still lose, but doing any of the above will improve your teammate's performance granted you yourself know what you are doing.","replies":[{"poster":"F3ORA","date":"2017-04-26T21:43:57.934+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm just proud of you for being the first person in years on the message boards having something positive and constructive to say.","replies":[{"poster":"VesperNadal","date":"2017-04-27T02:50:50.467+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=F3ORA,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=O8j9yKZ3,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2017-04-26T21:43:57.934+0000)\n>\n> I&#x27;m just proud of you for being the first person in years on the message boards having something positive and constructive to say.\n\nWow, usually people downvote me because I don't voice the popular opinion.
