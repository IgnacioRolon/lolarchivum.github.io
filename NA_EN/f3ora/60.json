My win rate would be down.  Consider also that all 4 of my teamates are always bad. You can no longer carry games with 4 bad teamates and a nerfed champ. Consider that good players don't rise up the ladder because teaching noobs gets you banned because they are know it all Fiora haters.   Adding a timer on her double lunge killed her double lunge.  I think that is irrefutable and makes you sound ignorant. Her double lunge was everything. No more double lunge. No more level 1 pentkills.  Not for me anyway.  Do any of you get level 1 pentakills with the new Fiora?  I doubt it. You killed her RIot.  You killed her...
