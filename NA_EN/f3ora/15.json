I'm still trying to figure out how to keep on opponents now that his movement speed has been destroyed by nerfs.\n\nBut I still play Garen.  I don't like where he is right now, but I still main Garen.  You, on the other hand, are stuck maining the old Fiora that no longer exists.

At all. Fiora's rework was awhile ago and any possibility of a revert are down the drain at this point because her design is working. \n\nYou say you're not as good with Fiora as you were old Fiora, that's obvious because she's a different champion. Take the time to practice her and I'm sure you'll be sat- actually no. You will never be satisfied because you can't move on. \n\nIf you do get a Riot response, don't expect it to go your way.\n\nEdit: also I have to question the feeding thing since you did well your last game as Fiora but you also built an ER on Singed...in ranked.
