Personally when I get trapped in those games where we have a split push comp that insists on team fighting and continuing to contribute to the enemy gold lead I would much rather just surrender. Not because I want to give up but because i would rather have a shot at a fresh game. Sometimes you don't want to be trapped in a game with potentially toxic or trolling teammates who aren't even trying to win but refuse to surrender because they know you can't leave.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PH Xcentric ","date":"2016-11-10T18:04:18.967+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't get your explanation, i'm probably not reading it right :D Anyway, TRUMP WIN wtf!
