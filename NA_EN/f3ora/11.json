Win your lane, really hard.\n2. Take their turret, shove the lane up.\n3. Rotate to another lane, win that lane too. Gank someone and take dragon or another turret.\n4. Ward up their jungle and take their jungle camps.\n5. Use lots of pings and alert your team of what objectives you're taking next.\n\nNow of course you will not win every game like this. Sometimes your team just feeds too hard, but if you really deserve to climb you *will* gradually climb.\n\nRemember, you've got 4 useless bronze 5 players on your team, but the *enemy* has *five* useless bronze 5 players on their team. That means if you are not also a bronze 5 player your team will have an unfair advantage in every single match.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dominick Destine","date":"2016-11-16T23:59:00.031+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Assuming this is not a troll thread , which it probably is;\n1- The absolute best advice I can give a bronze player is , and I hate saying it using this nomenclature.... don't \"Tilt\". The vast majority of low level games are lost because people quickly lose their cool, stay cool in every match and this will drastically increase your chances of winning.\n\n2- Avoid chat conflict with your teammates. Relates to #1.\n\n3- Ideally play jungler or mid, take advantage of the fact that enemy players are complete garbo with atrocious positioning and almost zero map awareness. A ganking jungler will obliterate low ranked games so easily... I was playing my alt account awhile back (Bronze 5) and I got it to Silver 5 by sporadically playing it, winning almost every game  as {{champion:1}}  {{champion:28}}  etc.\nhttp://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=solitium\n\n4- This is important but will occur gradually as long as you recognize your mistakes;\nImprove your personal mechanics, improve your timing and map awareness. \n\netc.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Eedat","date":"2016-11-16T23:34:10.530+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1) **Farm**. Get better at CSing. Push your lane out before you go roaming.\n\n2) Win lane then help the rest of the map. If you're winning your lane and your bot lane is losing, for example, then maybe try TP ganking bot or roaming there. A successful TP gank can get your bot lane back into the ame and can also help un-tilt them a bit.\n\n3) Always, **always** be positive. People tilt so hard and so easily. Be positive. Reminding your 0/3 team mate that they're playing like shit is going to make them play even worse. There is absolutely nothing to gain from flaming your team mates.\n\n4) Remember when I said that people tilt so easily? Well that can be used to your advantage. You can tilt the enemy team on purpose. Play some mind games. Some might say spamming mastery badges after getting a kill is BMing, but its not and you wont get banned for it. Do it. Tilt the enemy and make them play worse. Spam laugh. Spam taunt. Spam mastery. **Do not** straight up BM in all-chat.","replies":[{"poster":"Oglaf","date":"2016-11-16T23:53:20.072+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Eedat,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=ZzJ9hi3g,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2016-11-16T23:34:10.530+0000)\n>\n> 1) **Farm**.

Especially with the focus on Assassins brought on by the rework, low matches tend to devolve into what is essentially deathmatches.\n\nCS is just as, if not more so, important than kills during the laning phase!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Dreadlocks","date":"2016-11-16T23:36:07.620+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is this a troll thread? lol","replies":[{"poster":"Mecha MaIphite","date":"2016-11-16T23:42:18.269+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"half this guy's threads are whining about how old fiora was supposedly healthier than new fiora, and the other half are generic \"my team sucks\" threads","replies":[{"poster":"Dreadlocks","date":"2016-11-16T23:44:58.085+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh lol got it.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"SGT Dingle Berry","date":"2016-11-16T23:34:25.867+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thousands of people have fought their way out of bronze in this preseason alone, maybe it's a conspiracy that the best Fiora is always paired with the worst players?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Asayake 5150glow","date":"2016-11-16T23:25:28.397+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Learn Riven.\n\nThen 1v4 or 1v5.\n\n\nAlternatively, add me as a jungle/top :P","replies":[]},{"poster":"AttackOnTeemos","date":"2016-11-16T23:33:44.992+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Play Teemo, people still don't know how to ward right, full ap, hit a shroom and watch them melt.
