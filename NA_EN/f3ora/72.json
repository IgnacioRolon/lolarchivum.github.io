So you already have an advantage in that case when it comes to surrendering. So no, your idea is dumb. If you are so good, carry your games, 4 people won't surrender if you are doing well, and using your carry potential on other lanes. If you are a fed x laner, go to other lanes and help them out, make the enemy jungler's life hell, do something with your lead.\n\n\nWhat a lot of people that have that dumb never surrender mentality is while you may try to bash people that want to surrender and make them look bad, you also look bad to them. Having someone quit early is annoying, but want to know what is even more annoying? Having an ahole that never surrenders even when the game is clearly over. IF everyone on your team lost, move on, delaying the game is just going to get people into a ragefest, and while I don't condone people being toxic, they have every right to be.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Live2LetDie","date":"2017-05-29T17:35:18.655+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You take the L then move on.
