You posted on the boards, that is where you post for community interaction.  If you have something to discuss personally with Riot then that is what support tickets are for.\n\n2)  True, I might not play a lot of Fiora before or after.  However that does not mean that A) I don't know about game balance/health.  I work in the video game industry, you pick up a few things.  Me not playing her as much does not mean I am not aware of the issues her kit caused in terms of game balance. B)  While I might not be a big Fiora player, I do know where you are coming from.  I am a Taric main, and was long before he got reworked.  His rework changed his entire role as a champion and the style you play him in, far more so than Fiora.  So I do understand how you feel.  That feeling does not give you the excuse to throw a tantrum and be rude to others.\n\nIt is a reason to feel upset, but not to be unreasonable.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"BeatzBoyFTW","date":"2017-01-02T05:51:36.212+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why do you need that toxic kit back?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Slythion","date":"2017-01-02T05:46:53.964+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"no","replies":[]},{"poster":"Craft Zeppelin","date":"2017-01-02T04:06:18.550+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually the new ult is better in this meta.\nLike how are you going to kill off a poppy?
