Fiora's lunge was her everything. \n\nWithout the double lunge no more level 1 pentakills.  It's impossible. \n\nNobody was getting them but me. It's not cause she was an over powered champ. She was just right.\n\nShe used to be = to say a Zed or a Master Yi. \n\nNow she's squishy and does nothing when you ult 1vs5. \n\nIt's a placebo ult. Some complain about her old ult being too amazing...   \n\nShe's a \"no skill champ\" but those are just people bitter because I beat them with my mad skills.\n\nAnd I didn't beat them with my ult. I beat them with my lunge. \n\nTake away her lunge....   Take away Fiora.\n\nRiot just ruined her and that's the facts coming from the greatest Fiora player of all time. \n\nDo you think anybody at Riot cares more about Fiora than me?\n\nShe's a totally different champ. \n\nI long for the day they bring her back.\n\nBut I think they actually wanted to ruin her instead of make her better. \n\nJust before the rework they banned me from ranked as if to pick on me specifically for being so good.\n\nI was getting 40 and 0 so everybody cried to riot because they weren't as good at the game.\n\nI'm not happy with any other champ but her.\n\nI'm defiantly not happy with the rework and sometimes I just want to feed in apathy.

I felt your pain with all the changes, but i must say its okay, really :)\ni still dont quite like her Ult, just like you said...1/100000 times people will actually help take advatage of it...and if i manage to pop it...they barely use it and die...like idiots -_- and im left pinging aaaall the heal they could have had.\ni think the Q, W, and E are good tho! guaranteed crits are perfect so we dont have to build crit, i do wish the atk speed would last a bit longer than 1 hit though :S\nthe Q has almost full reset, so thats awesome. and the W....o god, nothing can counter it, and it counters ANYTHING...much better than the old.\nThe ult was the main essence of our old Fiora...and i still wish theyd change it to something else..but i really think with everything else they did a good job, now that ive played it for so long.\n\nP.S. HORRIBLE face and Hair updates, no one liked that, no one gets used to her Handsome Squidward face. disgusting, gimme my sexy Swordmistress back.","replies":[]}]}
