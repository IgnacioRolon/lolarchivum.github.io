That I am the one who did the most work?\r\n\r\nBefore this account I was the World&#039;s best Fiora famous for my level 1 pentakills.\r\n\r\nIf you have to depend on the skill of your teamates at all...  \r\n\r\nIt is no longer a game of skill. \r\n\r\nThat&#039;s what makes an E-sport and E-sport. \r\n\r\nSkill...\r\n\r\nNow I am afraid it is a game of chance. \r\n\r\nIt&#039;s a crap shoot. \r\n\r\nIt&#039;s like betting a million dollars on black with a 50% chance. \r\n\r\nIt&#039;s like a slot machine where you pull the lever over and over and always get 4 bad teamates almost. \r\n\r\nThat&#039;s how I feel. \r\n\r\nMy opinion is not &quot;spam&quot; in spite how every post I do is attacked with down votes for my feelings about Riot nerfing my champ because how good I was. \r\n\r\nI would like the community to be more constructive about making the game better.\r\n\r\nMaybe there is a way we can fix this &quot;E-sport&quot; \r\n\r\nI always get attacked and reported if I try to each new players in game however. \r\nPeople don&#039;t like to learn new things from better players. \r\nIt&#039;s like calling them &#039;stupid&#039; \r\nHow can I teach new players without losing my account?\r\n\r\nThings I want to teach newbies: \r\n\r\n1. Don&#039;t push a guarded turret...   I see that allot. Skip to a turret they aren&#039;t guarding. \r\n2. Help your carry... Group with your strongest player and support them instead of stealing their buff and their kills.\r\n3. Try to push lanes instead of drifting aimlessly and getting in team fights when you are lower level than them. \r\n4. Never ever surrender in any game for any reason. How can you climb ranked if the team quits? That&#039;s not fair.\r\n5. Don&#039;t talk smack to bad players... Instead help the weak ones instead of watching them die so you can talk about how bad they are more.","replies":[{"poster":"Galacius","date":"2017-07-10T22:43:58.474+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Heya, \n\nI am locking this thread due to violations of the [Universal Rules](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/4LgZ2EwM-universal-rules).

Continued low-effort posting in this manner will result in a permanent suspension from the boards, which is not allowed to be evaded through smurfs. People are willing to hold a conversation with you about any champion, but only if you can find a more constructive and respectful way to do so.\n\nIf you have questions or concerns about this action please visit us in the Moderation Discord here.\n\n-DTN","replies":[{"poster":"F3ORA","date":"2017-07-10T14:44:23.164+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Everyone is a Fiora hater including Riot...  \n\nThat means.   Your team isn't going to support the carry.  (A good way to lose the game)\n\nThey are going to talk trash and down vote you in the message boards (Fiora haters who hate good players beating them) \n\nYes I can be constructive and have always been constructive talking about Fiora...    \nI described several ways that could make the game better to no avail. \n\n1.  Make a new champ that is (The Old Fiora) and just give her a different name as a twin sister. (Constructive)\n            A good idea...   that is down voted and pissed on and reported by the community because (They are all Fiora haters)\n\nEveryone here hates to hear that I am better than them at the game and want to act like I must be bad.  As if I have bad Fiora builds...  \nSurely THEY could go from Bronze to challenger with a nerfed champ because their ego is the size of the moon even if they have 4 feeding champs every game who are 1 and 20. \n\nI don't really think there is any reaching anybody here.  \n\nThe people who reworked Fiora don't want to be told that they are simply Fiora haters who never loved Fiora in the 1st place.\n\nThe people who frequent the boards don't like to be told someone is better than them at the game...\nNobody likes to be told that the Fiora rework killed the game and indicates the sabotage of all E-sports in general.\n\nWhen the developers play god with an e-sport nerfing champs left and right they are destroying the entire idea of competitive gaming. \n\n)))))))))))))))))))\n\nI again argue that there is no longer a champ that can carry 4 bad feeding teammates. \n\nThat makes it a game of chance like gambling in Vegas with slot machines. \n\nI get banned from the boards because nobody ever listens when they read in 2017. \nAs the World's smartest man I would know. \n\nI get banned because the developers never communicate about it only the toxic visceral community looking for their next victim to down vote. \n\nIf you want Fiora to be good again...\n\nIf you want E-sports to flourish only do buffs and never nerfs.  Buff all the champs instead if you feel one is too strong. \n\nThe only reason you felt she is too strong is likely because of my SKILL...\n\nPeople who say she was a no skill champ are the people who are bitter about players like me who do have skill. \n\nYou stole her double lunge.   A constructive thing to do would be to give it back. \n\nFiora can't get level 1 pentakills until you give her the Q back. \n\nThat is what made Fiora good. \n\nThis wasn't even a topic about Fiora but you drug it out of me. \n\nIt's about how in spite all your talk nobody...  I mean nobody can carry 4 badly feeding teamates. \n\nI can give you all  30 tips to be better players but you will call it spam because you are a toxic community who likes to make people suffer.\n\nI have really given up hope. \n\nI was banned from ranked for being too good... \nThe developers reworked my champ because I was too good and I really believe that. \n\nIt's not the champ it's self. It was just a bully move on me specifically and you don't like it when I call you out about it. \nYou will just delete the entire thread if it makes you look bad. \n\nOther champs were also equally good as Fiora like Zed and Yi. \n\nIt would be harmless and beneficial to the game to bring her back as a twin sister...\n \nBut you aren't going to because you don't really CARE about being constructive. \n\nDo you Riot?","replies":[]}]}]}]}
