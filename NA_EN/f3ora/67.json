You help the smiteless jungle till lane till 3 or 6 so they can jungle on their own.\r\n\r\nLet&#039;s be frank.\r\n\r\nSmite is bad.\r\nSmite weapons are also bad.\r\n\r\nFlash and Ignight only.","replies":[{"poster":"Warpes","date":"2017-04-29T00:02:28.989+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can't tell if troll, or if head so far up own ass that not even light or time can escape the void it's entered in to.","replies":[{"poster":"dolphinosplash24","date":"2017-04-29T00:08:56.510+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Look at his other posts.
