The best Fiora in all of leauges.  Only new players surrender in any game. They are just new. When you call them noobs it just sounds \"toxic\" but that's what they are.  They do not yet understand horrible games can be won. They will never understand that it is pointless to try and climb the ladder if  you are just going to quit the game anyway.","replies":[{"poster":"Dynikus","date":"2017-03-13T01:46:48.998+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So if I'm to understand this right, new players are in challenger, experienced players are in bronze?
