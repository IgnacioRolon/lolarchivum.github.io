Often it turns out that their idea of what constitutes toxic behavior is very different from that of the community/Riot.\n\nBased on your post and comments, I'd guess that your punishment was for being excessively pessimistic/negative. I don't have a lot to go on, though, so I could be entirely wrong on that. If I'm correct, however, then what you did wrong is talk in such a way as to make the game significantly less fun for the other players.\n\nhttp://media.lolusercontent.com/api/embedly/1/image/resize?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.imgur.com%2F1HvNiEO.png%3Fnoredirect&key=a45e967db0914c7fb472fd4381e6c85b&width=150","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Best Kog NA","date":"2016-10-05T20:53:03.959+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well ya when you go ADC teemo in ranked you're gonna get counted as a troll.","replies":[]},{"poster":"F3ORA","date":"2016-10-05T20:44:25.557+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I knew if I made a vote you guys would be mean too...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cptn Sodium","date":"2016-10-05T21:18:07.390+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"sorry F3ora i feels your pain, the Riot community are pretty rude and heartless. they take this game so seriously. i get bans in norm blind picks all the time for trying unconventional methods and they work most of the time, but the salty community just cant handle any type of diversity.","replies":[]}]}
