She was also a fairly simple champion who had no incentive to be picked as she was basically another yi or tryndamere. Sure, her ult was fun, but it also provided no counter play since all she had to do was press it when she's low for invulnerability and quick life steal. This made her incredibly oppressive when she's ahead because it meant you had no chance of killing her if she had her ult up. With new fiora, she has a higher skill cap while also being one of the bests duelists in the game if played correctly due to her mobility, %health true dmg, w. and ult. Compared to her previous ult, her new ult has more counter-play as it isn't a click to win ability, you actually have to kite around you opponent in order to get its full effect. This also fits with her current theme better as a high-class swords woman as a good fiora just dances around you and makes you look like an idiot. Her old ult was I get free hits on you cuz why not? The old fiora's passive was also just another stat stick that did not provide an immersive experience at all. It was basically a nonexistent life steal ability. Her old q was also point and click which did not fit with her theme of a high class duelist at all as  it provided little to no outplay potential. To sum it all up, old fiora was a bland champion who did nothing show off her theme. She was basically another \"I whack you until you're dead champ.\" So I believe new fiora is better as it was a fairly well-received rework even by fiora mains as it truly captured her theme. It also stopped limited her chances of becoming a feast or famine type champion as Fiora's damage goes down by quite a lot if you cannot play her effectively which means that when one loses to Fiora on even grounds, it creates the sense of feeling out played rather than being out-statted.","replies":[{"poster":"F3ORA","date":"2016-10-07T18:15:30.417+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"I don't know what you wrote but I can tell that they are the words of an idiot who knows nothing about Fiora.","replies":[{"poster":"Yordle Hentai","date":"2016-10-08T02:11:09.437+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You lost the argument the moment you didn't even bother reading it :p","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2016-10-07T03:16:44.339+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow I am really pissed right now because I have the sudden urge to say horrifically mean things to you.","replies":[{"poster":"F3ORA","date":"2016-10-07T18:14:57.110+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"Why do comments like this get up votes but my post gets nothing but down votes?","replies":[{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2016-10-07T18:31:20.542+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because to be frank, you annoy a great deal of people in this forum with your complaining about Fiora's rework.  \n\nAnd my anger isn't even towards you.

Sounds simple, right? Well, just wait on her ultimate.\n\nFour-ish seconds of total untargetability, during which she would blink around, striking every enemy in the area and applying on-hit effects. Black Cleaver, Lifesteal, Ravenous Hydra AoE, any and all of them- even crits I think. It required no aim or timing whatsoever, and there was no counterplay besides Banshee's or becoming untargetable yourself.\n\nOld Fiora basically dashed into her enemy and either killed them or died. If she got fed and got ahead she was basically unstoppable, but if she fell behind and got shut down she had _no_ fallback options and could only play as a weaker and less effective version of her usual self. She was that binary, and it left her in a pubstomper state where she was the bane of newer and low-league players, but completely useless in high-level and pro play.","replies":[{"poster":"reaperteaser","date":"2016-10-08T16:13:56.378+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"sounds like an over glorified version of master yi","replies":[{"poster":"SkyblazeHydraX3","date":"2016-10-08T18:11:25.808+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"She basically was a second-rate Yi.
