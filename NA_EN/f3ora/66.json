Somehow I don't think anybody is all that worried about you and your bronze 5 scrub ass fiora. \n\nAnd I'm sorry to say but the world doesn't revolve around you. I really don't think anybody is going to miss you. Nobody was out to get you, nobody was out to ban you or get you to quit, you are actually irrelevant. \n\nSeriously I probably am coming off as quite toxic here, but seek some serious mental help. If you've made up this entire community to love you and aspire to be you, and made changes to mess with your fiora play and get you kicked out of ranked, you should actually seek mental help.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MaddÃ©y","date":"2017-06-16T19:41:14.694+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"League's community will surely suffer from a loss of such a valuable player.
