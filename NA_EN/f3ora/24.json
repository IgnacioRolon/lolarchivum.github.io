Why the hell would they remove surrender option? As of right now, 4 people need to agree in order to surrender, so you want to keep 4 people in the game, who don't want to be there because 1 person thinks he can carry or has \"never surrender mentality\"?","replies":[]},{"poster":"hunterspec","date":"2016-11-27T23:06:32.452+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"just one \n1. fire the people who do all the balancing at riot designing etc and hire a whole new staff.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TehNACHO","date":"2016-11-27T22:49:41.227+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1.

I would put Tryndamere on the top of the list","replies":[]},{"poster":"WinBoat","date":"2016-11-27T22:58:15.975+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"1. Let people leave the match whenever they want and join a  new match (you take a auto loss, lose LP but that's it). Yeah, I'm sick of you people saying remove the surrender option. It needs to be lowered to 15 minutes honestly in my opinion. If you're gonna remove it, then allow people to quit the match without being reported cause come on, you guys want to keep playing cause you have that chance of winning right? It's not fair to hold someone captive for a little longer to make them suffer and tilt them more during a match. You guys are selfish, that's the truth. I'm glad Riot realizes this and gives us the option to vote.\n\n2. Base rank off KDA, not \"winning/losing\" . If you perform  with an A or better, you gain LP. If you get an A- or lower, you lose LP. No more of this lady luck is smiling crap with RNG giving you the not so good teammates. \n\n3. Make champion shards cheaper, make runes cheaper. I don't care about getting a cool champion in a shard, I just want that essence to level my champion to 6 and 7. I want cheaper runes!!!!\n\n4. 1 Refund token per season\n\n5. This one here is big, but make League more social media in a way that it can broadcast players hoping to make it to LCS, or get noticed. Have a section that shows replays of matches or parts of matches from someone. For example someone in whatever rank they are in can submit a video, and if the judges approve, they can add that video to the home section under lets say \"featured spotlights\" or whatever you decide to call it.","replies":[]}]}
