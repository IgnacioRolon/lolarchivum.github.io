Asking for reports is ineffective because of the way reviews are triggered, so you're harassing people for no good purpose.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sarutobi","date":"2017-02-02T16:58:45.985+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"By riots eyes yes it is bad to ask for reports. If something as obvious as someone feeding needs to be stated either your teammates don't care, or you are looking to poss people off. For all you know it could have been someone new to the game, or new to the champion, and instead of helping them you just ask everyone in the game to report them because of their score.\nLike others have said that isn't how the report or banning system works. If you see someone breaking the rules report them after the game. Your report is the only one that needs to be stated. You don't need everyone to report this person. It's not going to make them get punished faster!","replies":[{"poster":"SirTeemoMushroom","date":"2017-02-02T17:20:31.291+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"but... i was playing with my main in  platinum div. with diamonds and platinums, h ow can he be a new player and go 0-17 gragas  ^__^","replies":[{"poster":"Magical Player","date":"2017-02-02T17:57:20.578+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SirTeemoMushroom,realm=EUNE,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=MKx5oWwE,comment-id=00040000,timestamp=2017-02-02T17:20:31.291+0000)\n>\n> but... i was playing with my main in  platinum div. with diamonds and platinums, h ow can he be a new player and go 0-17 gragas  ^__^\n\npost your chat logs that they sent you, you'd be surprised how much people fail to mention from the ohh so clean chat logs","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"EvilDustMan","date":"2017-02-02T14:58:25.729+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Chat logs.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shad√≤w","date":"2017-02-02T14:12:51.467+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"send chat logs","replies":[]},{"poster":"BeastsBane","date":"2017-02-02T18:46:46.189+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like gragas was inting, why would they ban you","replies":[]},{"poster":"scazzman","date":"2017-02-02T17:20:19.656+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"im honestly under the belief that riot keeps chat around because they need a steady supply of \"toxic\" players to use as sacrificial lambs","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-02-02T17:11:40.690+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have a lot of positive conversations in game, both about the game and otherwise.
