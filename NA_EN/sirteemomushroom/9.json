He never said they were above doctors either, rather he said they also heal which is true.  Your logic is someone who has a first aid licence can't heal because they haven't gone to school for it for years.  Doctors tend to be specialists in regards to treatments.  You need a heart transplant?  Get a heart surgeon, brain issues?  Brain surgeon.  Hell, I more than most know how damned specialized doctors get.  Ever met a gastroenterologist?  Yeah, someone who specializes in the esophagus and intestinal track.  \n\nDoctors deal with specific issues, often in regards to the area in which they trained.  That doesn't mean nurses don't also care for their patients.  Nurses are the ones who deal with most non life threatening issues.  They are the one who take measurements, apply most treatments, etc. etc.  The job of a doctor is to diagnose the issue, choose the proper course of action, and take care of highly specialized and complicated treatments that they are specifically trained for.\n\n-----------------------------\n\nI have esophageal issues.  First I went to a general doctor, they sent me to a specialist, who after listening said it might be one of 4 or so options my general doctor knew nothing about.  He then sent me to a number of different tests, all run by nurses (2 doctors related to my treatment, 4+ nurses so far) after getting those results I had to get a tube shoved down my throat, also done by 2 nurses, followed by one doctor assisted by 4+ nurses (I thought it would be like 2, waking up in the room after being put to sleep taught me different) putting a camera down my throat.\n\nThat comes to 2 doctors, one doing nothing but listening to my issues and referring me to the other doctor, the other one who only did one test.\n\nIt also tallies to 10+ different nurses who did everything from basic tests to things that in inexperienced hands could have scarred the inside of my throat which is quite dangerous.  (Scarring in your esophagus is one of the most common issues with it) \n\nI wasn't even a standing patient, I only came in for the tests.  Compare that to hospitalized patients who are taken care of by nurses daily.\n\n------------------------\n\nI am not saying the doctor didn't play a role.  However I am also confident that while it might have taken them a bit longer, the nurses could have also diagnosed the issue as they were the ones who did 90% of my testing, recording, and reporting of the results.\n\nIn terms of direct identification of and treatment of my problem the nurses did far more.  The doctor acted as an information source/analyst first, and healer second.\n\nNurses most certainly treat and heal people.","replies":[{"poster":"Serika Zero","date":"2017-01-20T05:16:21.607+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"I said nurses don't heal, doctors heal.\nHe lashes out saying that I'm \"disrespecting\" nurses.\n\nYou are overrating nurses.

Their job is to care for patients and help them heal, what possesses you to think that means they don't heal?\n\nDoctors are specialized and deal with high level medical issues.  Nurses deal with lower level cases, and in most cases spend more time helping patients directly as the jobs of many doctors are to diagnose patients or apply very specific and specialized medical attention.  Do you think doctors are the ones who splint a broken limb?  Or bandage up non life threatening wounds?  Not generally.  As you pointed out Doctors go through a lot more education, and that means there aren't enough of them to go around.  As such doctors tend to deal with highly technical treatments such as brain surgery, highly specialized treatments that the average doctor doesn't know much about, or work in diagnosis of symptoms.\n\nNurses fill in everything else, from running tests like checking blood pressure, to bandaging wounds, to stitching, to assisting doctors in surgery, to assuring the safety and cleanliness or patients, to applying continuous medical attention such as iv drops, pills, etc.\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nAlso note that he didn't \"lash out\" at you.  He corrected your statement, provided source for why he was correct, and asked you not to disrespect them.  \n\nYou on the other hand apply heavy sarcasm, provide nothing to back yourself up, and act out when people have a discussion with you trying to help you see why your statement is incorrect.  \n\nAlso out of curiosity, what _do_ you think nurses do?  You yourself stated they go to school to be nurses for 3-4 years.  They aren't spending that time goofing off.  3-4 years is a pretty strong education for most industries so they are clearly knowledgeable.  \n\nFor reference a quick search showed that an associates degree in nursing (the shortest education time) covers, and I quote, \"anatomy, nursing, nutrition, chemistry, microbiology among others.\" All those are related to taking care of and healing the human body, so I am confused as to what you think they are studying for and do.\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nAlso as a mostly unrelated side note my nurse porn includes very little healing ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)\nI am unsure as to why you would be inquiring about my sexual preferences in a reasonable discussion about the role nurses play in modern society though.  It is like you think you can embarrass me through that and therefore make me back down.  Clearly you failed to realize I am a Taric main, and as such I can openly say there isn't much I couldn't or wouldn't fap to.  Barring other bodily fluids/solids 'cause that is just gross and unsanitary and I wan't nothing to do with it.  I am sure you could find more things that I would say no to but in general I like to be a pretty open guy when it comes to things y'know?  Experience the world in all its forms and that jazz.\n\n######To Riot employees who see this and feel the need to remove it, please simply ask me and I will edit the above section so that readers can clearly follow the discussion because trying to read something with a deleted comment in it is really annoying and I don't want to force that on anyone.

Healing is \"the process of making or becoming sound or healthy again.\"\n\nThat means that putting a band aid on someone is healing.  Stitching a wound closed is healing.  Providing a cleanly environment that is conductive to a swift recovery and lowers the chance of infection is part of healing.\n\nI am trained in wilderness first aid.  That means that if you fall down in the woods and break a leg I am licensed to treat it with patient permission, or as I desire if they are unconscious.  I have the official medical training and knowledge to treat broken limbs, open wounds, concussions, burns, frostbite, severe altitude sickness, colds, etc. until the patient recovers enough to make their way to a hospital themselves or a hospital can be contacted to send a rescue team.\n\nI am expected to be able to care for patients in wilderness conditions for an unknown amount of time, as I will generally be unable to leave them and in most deep wilderness there is no contact signal.  Therefore I am expected to care for these people until they make a recovery or someone else shows up and can be sent for help.  I am licensed to _heal_ in impractical situations, which in many ways is more difficult than the same care in a hospital.  I am confident in my ability to do this because I have a good understanding of my limits.\n\nI have official, legal medical training for this.  I am confident in my ability to do these things to a competent degree.  It is pretty important when you hike/camp a lot.  This training was done over the course of 2 10 hour sessions.  20 hours, and I have the knowledge to competently care for someone in wilderness conditions.  \n\nIf someone can be taught the basics of healing in wilderness conditions I don't know why you think people who spend 40,000-100,000 dollars a year for a 4 year education don't have the ability to heal.  You state \"facts\" about how if all the doctors died and medical materials were burned people would die and not be healed, but your \"facts\" are anything but factual.\n\nYou then say if all the nurses were gone people wouldn't die.  There are 854,698 active doctors in the USA.  There are roughly 2,927,000 active nurses.\n\nIf you think that losing over 3/4ths of medically trained professionals, and they are professionals as they do specifically study medical related fields (as I quoted previously from an official nursing school curriculum) and have paying jobs in that industry, wouldn't cause people to die I am unsure of what I can say to you.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\nQuick questions:\n\n- Have you ever asked a nurse about their job?\n\n- Have you done any actual research on the jobs/roles of nurses?\n\n- Have you used any facts at all to support your opinion?\n\n- Do you even know any actual, statistical facts about nurses at all?\n\nIf you answered NO to any of the questions above, please take the time to become familiar with the subject matter that context the questions was created with before responding.  You do of course have all right to respond without doing so, but I also have full right to not read what you write.   You clearly want to convince others of your opinion as there is no other reason for you to be commenting so I would suggest bringing factual information next time to support your cause, as most people want actual facts before changing the way they think.","replies":[{"poster":"Serika Zero","date":"2017-01-20T20:05:03.869+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you can't change my mind, and usa is not the only country in the world.

I am not disrespecting doctors at all.  They play a very important role.  That being said their role tends to be one of a font of knowledge rather than a hands on except in situations they are specially trained for.\n\nNurses tend to do a lot of hands on work based on prescriptions giving by doctors.  Them getting guidance by doctors doesn't mean they suddenly don't play a role or aren't healing you.\n\nIf I need brain surgery then of course I want someone with training in that doing it.  When it comes to brain surgery the only people with that training are going to be doctors.  \n\nHowever if I got in a car accident and have a big gash in my arm I still want someone with training to do it.  The difference is that nurses have the training to do that.  At that point it doesn't matter if a doctor or nurse is treating you because while the treatment is an important one (I would rather not bleed out and die) it is a relatively basic one in comparison to brain surgery, and one that nurses are trained to do.  A professionally trained nurse is going to do the exact same thing as a doctor in that situation because the treatment is only so complex.  There isn't more to learn in regards to dealing with a large bleeding gash after a certain amount of training. \n\nDoctors and Nurses both get a lot of the same basic training.  The difference is that doctor's school goes beyond that and explores different areas as well while Nurse's school covers things related to patient care more.  Either way they both have the exact same ability to deal with such a wound after 1-2 years, and at that point you don't learn more in regards to such a wound because there isn't more to learn.\n\nSo if I am bleeding out from a big 'ol gash in my arm I would be perfectly happy having a Nurse stitch me up because they have the training to do so and a Doctor wouldn't do it better because both the skill floor and ceiling to deal with such a wound are only do high.\n\nNext time we are in the ER both missing a limb and there are only nurses available for the next 20 minutes I will happily accept their treatment while you lie there bleeding out waiting for someone who knows how to do brain surgery to come put a bandage on your wound and stop the bleeding, something anyone with basic medical knowledge can do.","replies":[{"poster":"Serika Zero","date":"2017-01-21T09:12:58.643+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"can the human population survive if all nurses die today? yes\ncan the human population survive if all doctors die today? no\nthat's my point\n\ni guess we can end this now\nnurses do NOT heal\nyou are just putting them on a high end pedestal due to personal bias","replies":[{"poster":"Serika Zero","date":"2017-01-22T08:02:02.930+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeh, they weren't called doctors, they were called HEALERS, or MEDICS, or shamans and other things\nif in today's age doctors will go missing you have a lot of mutated viruses that, at the smallest mistake, is gona kill a large portion of the population\nno more hearth transplant as nurses as incapable of doing that\nno more proper analizis of disease as nurse are incapable of doing that\nno more checking bacteria on the microscope to come up with a solution to fight it as nurses don't know jack shit about that\n\nnot nurses.\ni've said that nurses tend the patient, they don't heal them\nand obviously, to much nurse porn brainwashed you to believe that they are super important, they ain't, at all","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fondling Gems","date":"2017-01-21T09:39:32.241+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean technically the human population survived long before we had doctors, like, looooooooong before.  \n\nI am not even putting them on a high pedestal.
