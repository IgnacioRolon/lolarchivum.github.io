Banning a champion that's strong in Korea on another server is really pointless if the population in the server doesn't really use said champion the way Koreans do. You should ban accordingly to your server's playstyle, not Korea's.","replies":[]},{"poster":"WhiperSnapers","date":"2017-05-28T19:35:04.738+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have not played on the korean server before but from what I can tell, the two are very different when it comes to playstyle. I've heard from NA players that went to Korea that even in soloque they team fight early and often, so it makes sense that they would ban the strong team-fight oriented champions over the usual NA bans.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MysterQ","date":"2017-05-28T19:13:53.165+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wrong, Zed will get at least 3 bns on him.\n2 from one side who cant rely on soloque. 1 from your own team because they are still scared Faker is on both teams.","replies":[]}]}
