Not many tanks build {{item:3123}} or {{item:3165}} and I can't think of many damage champs who build {{item:3143}}.  \n\nOh sure, the TANK can build the tank item and the damage guy the damage ones, but saying \"just build X\" doesn't mean in lane against him you can or will do both.  The tank won't be getting focused anyway, so him taking reduced crit damage won't matter much... if he's getting focused down the Yas is dumb or the tank's entire team is already dead.  The healing reduction won't matter much either, since Yas will be three-shotting the squishy damage dealers then healing up AFTERWARDS, if at all.   Nevermind that neither item actually lets you CATCH the slippery mofo, just survive an extra hit or three from him or slow his sustain.\n\nNo.  {{item:3157}} vs Zed is a legitimate counter item, since it nullifies his ult and his main opponents are AP mids.  Yas goes mid or top and has multiple ways to ruin you or \"outplay\" you... as well as scaling into a monster just off of farm alone if he CAN'T get kills.  It's not even a contest.  Go on... pick a tank mid against a Yasuo and rush {{item:3143}}... see how well it works out.  Or rush {{item:3165}} on a squishy, immobile mid and see how much it helps when he can dive and blow you up if you don't live your entire life under tower (sometimes still even then).  Then even if you don't feed him, he'll just scale harder off his CS gold than you will, thanks to his bonus crit passive and wreck face midgame anyway.  \n\nI get that you're a Yas player and biased as fuck, but the dude is REALLY poorly designed.  Not OP.  Not UP.  Just really poorly designed.  He's a frustrating mess that will be loathed no matter what his stats are unless he sees a rework, and he needs to be purposely kept insanely UNDERtuned to not be a complete OP beast due to how overloaded his kit is.\n\nHe is a lousy champ because he was designed poorly.  He basically forces the enemy to stomp him out or he'll be a monster... and half his tools let him turn around attempts to stomp him out or shut them down with a push of a button.  (Talking bout you windwall!)  No one wants to have their playstyle dictated to them based on what the enemy picks... but it happens.  You have to go aggro on Nasus, for instance.  But giving him a ton of tools to not only cockblock the only way to put him down but to turn them around and snowball off of the failed attempts is what makes him so loathed.  Nevermind how he is binary as hell and seems to either hard-counter or BE hard countered with little in between.  Also no good design.  Also not much fun.
