I dont even want to play solely OP champs like jax or fizz or whatever, I'd just like to pick my damn champ. I'm not sure if it was a vocal majority that clamored for ARURF but having never posted or had an opinion on what direction the game should take for the game mode id like to have fun again playing it rather than rolling for champs that it is not weighted to give me. I'd rather be against 5 champs considered op or strong than lose the freedom that makes league of legends and urf fun. Even a rotation between random and not random would be fine to me, OR CUSTOM GAMEMODE URF WHILE ITS RUNNING? The latest ask riot on why they don't run it is laughable to me, show the data if that's why you made the decision. Don't just say it's there. I'm usually forgiving and make a serious effort to understand decisions by riot or other devs. I used to look forward to urf and play dozens maybe even close to a hundred games of it. Now my friends don't want to play it and anyone who does just gets frustrated because they are most likely playing something they dont want to, and the opposing team has powerful urf champs anyways since its weighted towards them. make TRUE random with ALL champions or make it original urf again for the love of fun. When urf comes up in the rotation it's more like a reminder of what is gone than an exciting return of the most fun gamemode in league of legends. Just one less reason to que up for a game that isn't ranked I guess. Good job consolidating the playerbase rito. Judging by the 3min+ que for urf when i have tried to play it, I would say its being played less so maybe its being successfully killed.","replies":[{"poster":"SKRRRRRRAT","date":"2018-01-01T10:34:32.695+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":2,"body":"reddit posts saying urf should be random always got thousands of upvotes so now we're stuck with this crap","replies":[{"poster":"ApexInTheCircle","date":"2018-01-01T16:20:49.195+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SKRRRRRRAT,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=dimGEIEM,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-01-01T10:34:32.695+0000)\n>\n> reddit posts saying urf should be random always got thousands of upvotes so now we&#x27;re stuck with this crap\n\nRight there is the fucking problem IMO Riot seems to listen to Reddit more than they do their own boards.
