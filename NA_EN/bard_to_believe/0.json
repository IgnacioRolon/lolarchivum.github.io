What are you smurf from silver?\n\nIf you are dying to a Fizz lvl 3 then you really don't know how to play. No one can dive under tower lvl 3, especially when they need to wait 2 sec for w to get ready.\n\nAlso Fizz is one of the most risky midlaners in the game, with 0 ranged abilities, 0 sustain, and a farming tool that costs mana to use (Annie has the same thing but ranged and refunds full mana). He needs to q into your face and wait for 2 seconds before being able to do dmg. Try building defensive next time, you know against an assassin who is meant to kill you in lane.\n\nNext time shitpost from your main account, might give you some credibility. Or is this better than it.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
