My account, which has been secure for like 7 or 8 years (yes, it's a beta account...) was hacked within 24 hours of adding my debit card to my account for the first time. I'd always used PayPal up until Monday, so this is pretty amusing to me.\r\n\r\n1. When I try to log in to the client, it says \"Your account is in the process of transferring. Please try again in a few minutes.\" It has said this for almost two hours now.\r\n\r\n2. When I try to log in to the website, it says my username, password, and region combination is not found. Wait, what?\r\n\r\n3. When I recover my account name via email address, it gives me the account name I am expecting.\r\n\r\n4. When I recover my password via account name, it works and lets me reset the password. After resetting the password, it does nothing. All points above stay exactly the same.\r\n\r\nPretty wild that you can hack and transfer peoples accounts around and Riot never even so much as asks for an email verification or anything of the sort. Riot doesn't even offer a two step verification setup... For real? Basically the biggest and most lucrative game on the planet and you won't spare a few dollars to secure your players accounts?\r\n\r\nPS. No virus/keylogger/etc on my computer, as I know someone will suggest. All my other accounts, including social media, are still secured and untouched. My League account was hacked within 24 hours of saving a debit card to it.\r\n\r\nPSS. I have submitted tickets, still waiting on a reply.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-25T16:56:10.994+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Losing access to your account can be pretty scary, but we can help get it back to your hands as well as any reparations needed.  I haven't heard of any cases where a compromise would result from adding your cc info, but I suggestion going through the[ account protection ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751664-Protecting-Your-Account)guide just to make sure all of your info is secured in and outside of League.  \n\nIf you want to toss me your ticket number, I'm happy to check the status of your ticket.  Just make sure it was doing through an [account recovery form](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=72416) and not a regular ticket to help expedite things a bit.

I answered as many questions as possible.\n\nThanks for looking in to this for me, I really would like to be able to play this weekend.\n\nAs far as account protection goes, I am actually an IT Professional, and have always taken every step possible to make sure my account was secured, which is why this comes as such a shock to me.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-26T16:30:07.566+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I looked into your ticket and everything looks good to go.  :D  Hit up Phatmage if you have any other questions or concerns!","replies":[]}]}]}]}
