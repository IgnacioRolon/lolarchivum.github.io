You can sign up for the PBE through an [application](https://pbesignup.eune.leagueoflegends.com/en/pbe).  We can't guarantee or expedite applications, but details on how they are selected can be found in our [PBE FAQ](http://eune.leagueoflegends.com/en/page/pbe-faq).  Good luck with your application!","replies":[]}]}
