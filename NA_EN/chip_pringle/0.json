First match I faced a Shyvanna.  Pretty even match up, I ended up getting a few kills on her as she was constantly pushing.  After about 20 minutes into the game I start roaming trying to influence other lanes, I am doing well, making some plays, getting some assists.  But every time I leave top lane, Shyvanna is at my tower pushing them down.  I am unable to kill her myself now as she is so tanky, so I constantly have to stick to top lane.\r\n\r\nThen I remember why I don&#039;t like top lane, it is like farm simulator.\r\n\r\nI cant even blame Shyvanna for that strategy, because it clearly was working.  The pressure eventually won them the game.\r\n\r\nI guess my only conclusion is I think the towers are to weak, way to easy to push down.\r\n\r\nAnyways no more top for me lol.\r\n\r\nWhat do you guys think about Top lane?","replies":[{"poster":"ff4sk","date":"2016-03-09T19:40:44.494+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the towers are weak but that's not what made you lost. What made you lost is how unbalanced top laners are once they reach mid game. They deal roughly the same damage if not more than an adc with all the advantages for being tanky.\nYou stood no chance to begin with going as wu vs a tank. Maybe if you were to go quinn and kite the shit out of her you might have had a chance.","replies":[{"poster":"Chip Pringle","date":"2016-03-09T22:10:46.371+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with your assessment entirely.  My goal this season is to pretty much specialize in one champion, Wukong, and be very skilled with him.  I find in my elo (silver) players put to much emphasis on what is OP and what the pro players are doing instead of being great with a single champion.  I will just stick in the jungle and maybe mid as my secondary","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BadmoonBC","date":"2016-03-09T19:37:04.816+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Top lane is prolly the most important lane this season. So much split pushing, tp saving and Shen/pantheon ulting madness.\nI am a damn good Mundo, I get fed 9/10 on him. But my good friend, although less mechanically versed than I, is a better overall top laner. He knows when to do what. Whereas I am constantly reacting instead of pro acting.","replies":[{"poster":"Chip Pringle","date":"2016-03-09T22:04:47.137+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sounds like you really like top lane!

Unlike you, shyvana was NOT playing TDM, she went for objectives. If you do some hard roams from top lane, do it with the mindset of taking dragon or bot/mid tower.

Wanna farm and dominate your laner over and over until they cant sit under tower? That works. Wanna help your team and push for objectives? When you move your happy ass down from top lane your team is usually more than happy to help you take towers. \n\nI always thought top was ONLY about farming, but you have a lot of control over the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Chip Pringle","date":"2016-03-09T21:00:05.545+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It seems to really enjoy the fruits of TOP lane is to become skilled in it.

This is an oversimplification of what you should be doing in top lane if you're playing a lane bully like Wu Kong: out trade your lane opponent, force them to back and/or blow summoners, freeze or shove lane depending if the laner is still there, roam to push lanes in, return to top to do the same.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Korillo","date":"2016-03-09T19:45:38.797+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you are grouping with your team and allowing the enemy top laner to split push, then you need to force fights. You will win any 5v4 and your team will be able to push a tower far faster than a single top laner.\n\nGetting kills on the top laner is all well and good, but if they are constantly out pushing you and putting pressure on the top lane, and you aren't successful in your roams then you are a being a detriment to your team.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Boulderox","date":"2016-03-09T19:31:16.209+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well... split pushing is the new thing, tank {{item:3512}} is the new FoTM thing, so that is why the top lane has changed a bit for the worse i think.","replies":[{"poster":"Chip Pringle","date":"2016-03-09T19:37:19.651+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agreed","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"xdeviltwinkiex","date":"2016-03-09T18:59:40.871+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I love top I'm all secluded and away fr everyone but my jungler.
