At what point did he decide that hairstyle was a good idea?? Short duckbutt on top with bangs and super long on the bottom? It&#039;s like a mutated mullet on steroids. Did Zed cut his hair as a child and then gave up halfway? Does Zed not care??  Is he keeping it long because he would look too much like Sasuke if it was shorter? Kayn&#039;s super arrogant does he not realize that his head looks like he buzzed the back with a lawnmower? Were all the other Order of Shadow acolytes too afraid to tell him that his taste in hairstyles is as godawful as his base form? Did he just go ham on himself with a pair of scissors?? I dont understand.\n\nI&#039;d imagine that maybe because he&#039;s an assassin he strikes and kills so quickly that no one can get a good look at his bizarre choice of a haircut, but I dont know.","replies":[{"poster":"Academy Kayn","date":"2019-01-06T01:35:48.388+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel attacked by this post.","replies":[{"poster":"birdclock ","date":"2019-01-06T02:37:21.715+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I hope youâ€™re studying cosmetology at your academy.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Akali Prime","date":"2019-01-05T23:44:06.310+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:131}} {{champion:245}} {{champion:74}} {{champion:40}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:518}}","replies":[{"poster":"EdgeLady","date":"2019-01-06T03:17:44.542+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Akali Prime,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=AQXdamMp,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2019-01-05T23:44:06.310+0000)\n>\n> {{champion:131}} {{champion:245}} {{champion:74}} {{champion:40}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:518}}\n\nLet us not forget {{champion:26}}.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Warlord Rhinark","date":"2019-01-07T10:48:49.405+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Akali Prime,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=AQXdamMp,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2019-01-05T23:44:06.310+0000)\n>\n> {{champion:131}} {{champion:245}} {{champion:74}} {{champion:40}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:518}}\n\n{{champion:84}}","replies":[{"poster":"Akali Prime","date":"2019-01-07T18:18:32.194+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"nuuuuuuuu not my girl \n{{sticker:sg-janna}}","replies":[{"poster":"Warlord Rhinark","date":"2019-01-07T19:05:19.488+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Akali Prime,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=AQXdamMp,comment-id=000100010000,timestamp=2019-01-07T18:18:32.194+0000)\n>\n> nuuuuuuuu not my girl \n> {{sticker:sg-janna}}\n\nHer hair is more fucked than her win rate.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Blood Magicks","date":"2019-01-05T22:31:41.575+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Upvoted for description.
