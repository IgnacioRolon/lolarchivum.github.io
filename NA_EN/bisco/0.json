To my surprise, I was able to load pages up. Not only that, I could also stream youtube videos with very little lag. I tab in back to the game, to see if it's finally working, but only see the same damn message: Reconnecting. \r\n\r\nTo remove any other doubts, the LOL client was the only thing that was running for me. No Firewalls, no antiviruses, or HD movie downloads. Just me and the game. \r\n\r\nWas wondering if anyone else had this weird problem lately.","replies":[{"poster":"AztecDevil2000","date":"2016-06-11T21:22:08.658+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"same thing has been happening for me recently though more so with the stable ping then dropping for no reason and having to relog to get back in","replies":[]},{"poster":"Velasan","date":"2016-06-10T22:16:34.908+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hoping this gets resolved soon... this issue started in the middle of my gold promos, and now have lost several games due to lag and weird issues.\n\nSo, in the mean time I'm playing hexakill until this blows over.","replies":[]},{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-06-10T21:18:44.326+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I went ahead and looked into your account and it appears that you are connecting from California.
