Jungling a mage is no different than trying to jungle Sej, you're not meant to have healthy early clears due to being superior team fighters than those who do have healthier clears. Even some of the healthy clearers have garbage clear times anyways.\n\nYou shouldn't have a jungle balanced around people crying they can't Lux jungle, if you make it easier to do that then you end up with Udyr, Gragas, Elise, etc dominating the jungle due to the item being overloaded as an attempt to make it so every champion that is designed for laning to be able to jungle.","replies":[{"poster":"BLACK REALM GOD","date":"2016-02-29T10:16:46.440+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"so what youre saying is... this is burger king league and you wanna have it your way.\n\nthe movement speed is meant to buff *gasp* movement speed in AP heavy champs. there are very few ap based champs that actually have enough movement speed and attack speed and damage to start off on even ground without building directly for this item. elise if one of those few who doesnt need it but it helps. if you look at champs like jax and kha'zix they have 350 movement speed. even if elise has runic echoes she wouldnt be able to run away from a jax. she'd have to have boots. that's the difference.mages are inherently slower even for someone like elise who was built for the jungle. olaf is another one of the 350 movement speed champs even sejuani still has 340 movement speed. elise would have to stay in spider form to be able to move fast enough to keep up or get away from any of those champs early game. another thing. mages and ap based champs are a lot more resource reliant. as in they need mana to be effective. most fighters who use devourer rely on auto attacks and self buffs making it way easier to fight prolonged. the issue comes in when champs like warwick grab runic echoes, but even that isnt really that much of a problem.","replies":[{"poster":"Sir Yamazuki","date":"2016-02-29T11:16:15.993+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=BLACK REALM GOD,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=PO3ErZ4h,comment-id=00040000000000000000,timestamp=2016-02-29T10:16:46.440+0000)\n>\n> so what youre saying is... this is burger king league and you wanna have it your way.\n> \n> the movement speed is meant to buff *gasp* movement speed in AP heavy champs. there are very few ap based champs that actually have enough movement speed and attack speed and damage to start off on even ground without building directly for this item. elise if one of those few who doesnt need it but it helps. if you look at champs like jax and kha'zix they have 350 movement speed. even if elise has runic echoes she wouldnt be able to run away from a jax. she'd have to have boots. that's the difference.mages are inherently slower even for someone like elise who was built for the jungle. olaf is another one of the 350 movement speed champs even sejuani still has 340 movement speed. elise would have to stay in spider form to be able to move fast enough to keep up or get away from any of those champs early game. another thing. mages and ap based champs are a lot more resource reliant. as in they need mana to be effective. most fighters who use devourer rely on auto attacks and self buffs making it way easier to fight prolonged. the issue comes in when champs like warwick grab runic echoes, but even that isnt really that much of a problem.\n\nXin, Udyr, Yi, etc are actually ineffective with no mana. Neither would reach a target to auto attack them to death with their on-hit nonsense. If you're letting an oom Xin or Udyr walk all over your team, then it's an issue with your team and not the champion. Devour and Runic aren't the only jungle enchantments either, all mana based tanks who use Cinder are worthless with no mana, and any mana gated champion that use warrior is also worthless with no mana.\n\nElise should also be the least of your worries, she had been good with every ap enchantment while also doing extremely well with Cinderhulk. Comparing her to champions that can only be good with 1 of the available and are rarely at the top is silly. Ranged champions are meant to be slower than melee champions anyways, they have range to compensate for being slower and most of them have cc in addition to range and sometimes even mobility. They are meant to be punished when jumped on. You're also only picking out the ones that favor your argument anyways, Naut was in the jungle for a while and he's at 325 move speed while there's also Malphite and Shen with 335. I don't even know why you brought up move speed honestly, some of the champions abusing this item are at the higher end of the base move speed, they also have mobility built into their kits, and also have cc. Elise isn't the only champion buying this item, and it's not only ranged champions buying it either. Unless of course you think Grag, Rumble, Udyr, and Amu are extremely slow ranged champions.\n\nYou have both Devour and Cinderhulk junglers choosing to buy Runic Echoes instead, and they win more often with Runic Echoes than they do with their original item. You know, similar to how everyone before was buying Cinderhulk until it was nerfed.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
