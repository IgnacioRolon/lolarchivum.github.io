Why isn't it ok to have a champion be very strong when executed exceptionally well? Especially one that has a lot of built in weaknesses and counters. Isn't that the point of the barrel mini-game? Being melee, and highly telegraphed, he's very reasonably countered by high mobility melee, or smart ranged play. A good example would be Morde ADC, incredibly strong when executed properly, with a good deal of weaknesses built in.\n\n2. Why not wait a little bit and see what happens as his opponent's experience levels rise as well. Compare the number of games a GP player has had with him vs the number of games an opponent has played against GP. When you immediately take power away, you don't allow him to be strong once people figure out their side of his mini-game and you have to re-buff him, and Riot never really reverts buffs for some reason, so you'll end up adding new power which will be untested and could skew things even further. It will always take longer for a GP opponent to get to the experience level as the GP player as they aren't guaranteed to have him in as many games as the player.\n\nThis isn't Ryze. His skilled play isn't completely shutting down the input from the other player. Rather his skilled play is mitigating his weaknesses while still presenting them as a point of attack for his opponent.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Scruffy","date":"2015-08-23T18:17:26.068+0000","up_votes":24,"down_votes":4,"body":"1. It is actually VERY ok to have a champ be strong when exectued well. The actual \"win rate\" for balanced champs when played by a skilled and experienced player of that champ should be something like 53% not 50%. The issue is when you see that \"experienced win rate\" rise up to like 58%, then you can reasonably suspect the champ is op. As an aside, the data you see on sites like OP.GG or LolKing is average so it's hard to extrapolate from that to know a champs real power. \n\n2. I don't actually have a ton of specific context on what the reasoning and strategy is for the GP changes is this time. Either way, I'll probably ask them what the goals are and I trust they have a solid rational explanation. Most likely these changes are meant to be a small love tap type nerf for GP, he's not incredibly dominant I agree. ","replies":[{"poster":"Nagoh Shan","date":"2015-08-23T19:11:36.355+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"The issue is, all we have are Champion.gg, op.gg, and lolking to go by. Maybe a good idea, though time consuming, would be a short blog write up, that just explains the thinking behind balance adjustments, what you guys look at and for, and where it is that you feel things should fall if they are to be considered reasonable. Maybe show us some of the data you are using to make these decisions.\n\nTo be honest though, this one's hard for me to just accept that they have a good reason. I've wrecked as GP, I've been wrecked as GP, I've been wrecked by GP, and one of the things I've felt about him is that it always feels good. I don't feel like I just outstated someone, or got outstated (except for a match vs Kayle, but Kayle is nuts). Playing him feels like play vs outplay. Like there's something I could have done to make that go better in my favor or that they should have done to respond better. \n\nAnd it's really hard to see that there's something we're missing in our statistics aggregation sites, mainly because when I look at GP in Master's Division, and he's got a 58.65% winrate with 104 games played, and he's 30th on the winrate list. Which is close to what you were saying, yet he's 30th overall. With gameplay like his, and the various winrates of multple champions, and the way it feels playing vs some champions, and rioter's own comments, threads like this and uncertainty in the thought process is obviously going to pop up. Eve #18 on winrate, 106 games played at 63.21% winrate, and I've heard very little QQ about her recently. People don't feel bad playing against her as much anymore. Leblanc #13 at 65.22% with 69 games played. People hate Leblanc, and it's a common theme that it's not terribly fun to play against her. \n\nThis is all we've got to go on, we don't get to know what you use to balance, and what metrics you use when tuning. And when you say that they're averages so it's hard to understand on our end, it gets even more confusing as to what information you guys go by if not for winrates and performance stat averages.\n\nCan you see how people get confused an frustrated? With the information we have, it really does look, and has for a while, that new options become strong, while favored strong options are still strong, yet no longer the primary or only option. The new thing gets toned down and the favored champ remains advantaged. Approaches to strong champions and items are inconsistent, and often consistently inconsistent in the sense that if one champ or type of item is strong, not even out of spec that a predictable response will be made. \n\nS4 Elise nerfed super hard while a wait and see approach was taken with Lee sin, Lee dominates the jungle until S5 jungle changes. S5 jungle and cinderhulk makes tanky junglers strong, tanky junglers, gromp, or cinderhulk itself see nerfs in every patch. Runeglaive enters, and powerful carry assassins become viable in jungle, runglaive and champ stats both nerfed, even though the champs weren't out of wack before item introduction. Devourer gets changed and ends up coming out with more base gold value in combat stats than warrior, with silly scaling mechanics, and instead of nerfing it like Cinderhulk/runeglaive, a wait and see approach is taken. \n\nI fully believe that the balance team believes these are the correct decisions. I don't go so far as to think they have pet champs that they like, rather that they feel certain gameplay is healthier, and tend to try to promote that. However they communicate poorly, and often seem to make balance adjustments to protect players from having to adapt or learn, and it holds back the growth of the game. Metas end up super closed and predictable with certain champs seeing a lot of play and others being relegated to people who will make it work no matter how inefficient it is, all because they don't like certain types of mechanics or play patterns.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LeeDark","date":"2015-08-23T19:06:47.056+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"1.
