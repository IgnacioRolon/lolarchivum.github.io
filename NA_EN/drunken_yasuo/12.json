Gragas and maokai will completely destroy teamfights if even ahead and if behind they are still useful.\n\nI'm not saying they are op at all, just pretty strong in terms of usefulness and teamfighting.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Zhugan","date":"2015-08-21T01:29:26.277+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry, but while Gragas is balanced, Maokai isn't really. (He's the best top lane tank in the entire game, and he kinda forces out most other top lane tanks other than Shen who is based 100% on his ultimate.)\n\nIrelia and Annie don't need nerfs. The Zed buff was tolerable.\n\nThe Lee buffs and the lack of Vayne nerfs are hauntingly bad decisions, but that means that you are swinging something like 3/8 out of your complaints which means I don't think that you know what you're talking about.","replies":[{"poster":"A Miss Fortune","date":"2015-08-21T06:00:37.628+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I actually have never really hated Gragas even before multiple other nerfs he has received in the past, playing with or against him. He hasn't really ever been toxic and he has clear weaknesses. I also like how playing AP Gragas or playing Tank Gragas can work so he's not just shoved into one role/build like other champions. He's probably one of the last tanks I would want nerfed.\n\nThe thing I don't like about Maokai is how easy it is for him to initiate teamfights, follow-up on ganks, and he doesn't really have a really weak spot to the game. If he's ahead he's really annoying to deal with, if he's behind he's still extremely strong since he has more than enough utility. At every stage of the game he can be strong and even when the Maokai plays bad and doesn't do great he's still a huge threat and very relevant.","replies":[{"poster":"Zhugan","date":"2015-08-21T06:06:55.735+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thus my point that Gragas is fine and Maokai is pushing other top lane tanks out of play. His entire kit allows him to work without having as much gold as other tanks because of the raw amount of disruption and tankiness that it brings to the table.\n\nHe gets AoE damage mitigation from his ultimate, a slow, a knock up/back, and a point and click snare. His amount of CC is insane, and combined with his relatively high damage for a tank, easy laning, and remarkable variety of build paths... He needs a nerf to let other top lane tanks shine through.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Pale Pirate","date":"2015-08-21T01:32:15.161+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Vayne overpowered?
