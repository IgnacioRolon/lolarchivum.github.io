I've seen it more places than just here too. It seems that we are leaning towards the outcome of a fight being decided more and more by what happens in the actual ten seconds or so of engagement rather than the positioning and resource expenditure of the previous thirty seconds, or the items bought five minutes ago. Justifications like \"counterplay\" are used to rationalize more power in kits and less on items, or skillshots rather than targeted damage. Resources have become less important with many manaless champions seeing play, and even mana users tend to forget about the resource after an item or two.\n\nThe problem here is that tactics is being emphasized more than strategy. MOBAs as a genre appeal differently than say FPS games in that you have persistent power that can dramatically change over the course of a game. One or more players can \"carry\" the team to victory, and both the successes and failures revolving around carries make the game more interesting. If that's gone, it's easy to feel powerless to make up for a struggling team. Shut-down gold, for instance, becomes less meaningful when items like armor are less powerful.\n\nWhen we emphasize tactics, twitch reflex and teamwork become more important than individual performance and anticipation. It's like we've forgotten that it's both frustrating and fun to win or lose by fighting or becoming the player that carries the game. It's like we've forgotten that buying a Banshee's Veil to block that Annie nuke is arguably purer counterplay than *sidestepping* a Veigar's Baleful Strike. By allowing counterplay in anticipation the game becomes more cerebral. Encounters aren't won or lost by a tenth of a second swing.\n\nAs it is, it feels like the game is leaning towards something that might be very tense and entertaining to watch, but is not that much fun to play. League was fun because it *wasn't* like a twitch shooter. That's less true now. \"Skill, not stats,\" is a worrisome philosophy when stats tend to be determined by things that absolutely *should* matter, such as anticipatory counterplay (buying items) and past performance (how well you've performed so far in a given game).\n\nAnd come to think of it, aren't squishy champions *supposed* to take more damage?

Tanks generally have cc (but that can now be parried).  Essentially, by building more damage an ADC stands a better chance against Fiora, but a tank shouldn't build more damage -  they have no way to prevent her from killing them just as fast.  With 75% armour pen physical damage, it would at least allow the tank to defend a little bit against her.\n\nVayne has the same problem - the only response a tank can have to her is Randuins/Frozen Heart.  Against a heavy AP team, that means that the tank has to build one of two items that only help against a single champion on the enemy team.  Yes, Frozen Heart helps against Azir and Randuins helps with its slow.  Any other champion can build damage and hope to burst her down, but a tank literally has no other recourse.\n\nPercent max health true damage disproportionately punishes tanks.  This is not an issue with Vayne (Well, I still think it is, but I main Leona) as she is supposed to bust tanks.  On the other hand, the goal is Fiora is to make her capable of fighting anyone with relatively equal ease.  In order to do this, it would actually be better to give her 75% (or so) armour pen on her Vital Strikes, so that tanks are capable of fighting her but still have items available to buy which they can build to help fight her.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AMYS GRAVE","date":"2015-07-22T20:03:50.705+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"but why % MAX health true damage? why not % CURRENT health true damage or % MISSING health true damage.

However. (There's always a \"but\" in there somewhere.)\n\nTanks don't have the damage to deal with Fiora to begin with. Fiora, essentially, will be more likely to kill a tank than a squishy because... A tank can't really fight back. A BRUISER can, an ADC can (provided they manage to survive Fiora's basic attacks of course,) But a tank... Can just kinda sit there and take it. There are, obviously, exceptions to this like say, Sejuani whom is based around consistent damage, Amumu with his constant damage and MR Shred and Volibear with his health-scaling execute. \n\nA tank will have to do one of three things; \n1. Wait Fiora's damage out until an ally can come save them,\n2. Run away with their tail between their legs or,\n3. Attempt to fight Fiora and lose to the lifesteal Fiora is inevitably going to build, even if she doesn't get to hit the vitals even once. The passive is just insult to injury in this case, really.\n\nI'll be perfectly honest though. Even as someone who used to main tanks (and still plays lots of them,) I'm looking forwards to Fiora's update! It looks like a very fun kit to play with!","replies":[{"poster":"I Miss Cannon","date":"2015-07-22T06:27:52.098+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"She deletes squishies when she hit a weak spot and E'd and that's pretty easy considering a skillful Fiora which uses her W right is immune to (self-)peel.

So while this still may cause some frustration, I hope this at least explains why it's on the kit!\n\nit does explain, but imo i feel like it's going to have the opposite effect. I don't have a pbe account, so can't try it myself, but I see this very quickly getting abused. Why build damage when you have guaranteed damage against everything? Assuming they are high enough, I see a lot of fioras simply building straight tank and killing everyone with her free damage. No \"skillful\" play possible if her opponents don't have a dash of some kind and no skill needed from fiora if she can build full tank and take her time hitting every single weak point.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"iChelpilz","date":"2015-07-21T21:55:40.570+0000","up_votes":20,"down_votes":3,"body":"and i thought vayne was toxic lol","replies":[{"poster":"TheFirstGokun","date":"2015-07-22T00:03:17.181+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"You can't dodge Vayne.
