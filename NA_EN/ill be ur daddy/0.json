How many lines must we hear from Gaston before we can be allowed to claim that we recognize he's extremely different from Mufasa?  It's clear to all that this new Aatrox is not the same person as we remember him.  People are hurt about that because even _if_ this new Aatrox is cool, we feel that he completely replaced someone totally different that we've loved for years.  I'm not saying we won't like new Aatrox, I'm not saying he's bad, I'm not saying he won't be fun.  I'm saying that all of those things are irrelevant to our feelings of grief at losing a beloved character.  If my wife dies but I find a new wife, I will still be forever sad about the one I lost.  That is the point many of us have tried to make, but are understandably too emotionally distraught to come off as respectful or reasonable.\n\nPersonally, I feel strong emotions toward you and believe you have hurt me.  But I am not trying to make a villain out of you.  You did what you felt was best and worked your ass off to make it happen.  I am holding back strong feelings because I want to speak with you as equals, and I intend to do my very best to remain composed and reasonable.  I know I'm no one special, but may I please ask for your thoughts on what I've said?  I regret not being good enough to be worthy of it, but even so, I speak for many, and I'm doing it as best as I can.","replies":[{"poster":"WAAARGHbobo","date":"2018-06-15T06:27:51.520+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":31,"body":"Hey I really sorry you feel this way.

Aatrox was a character that had a dual nature that juxtaposed with itself and i feel like that is part of the reason why he was so thematically attractive to most of the player-base like aurellion is. \n\nAatrox was a character that saved people from hopeless battles, turning the tides of war, saving lives a hero to many. Statues were built of him and he became part of history in almost every civilisation. Yet this was a facade to a darker truth, he was a character that delighted in conflict and would save people to cause further conflict down the line. He took pleasure in this, pleasure in tormenting men and turning them into monsters. The people he \"saved\" weren't really saved at all, instead they were dammed and led down a path they thought would make them heroes saviours of their people but in reality led them down a path of slaughter and violence. They were worshipped as heroes, saviours of their homes, families and people but they eventually learned the truth, that they were just monsters committing atrocities against others. He refers to tryndamere as his greatest creation, a man so bent by vengeance and anger that he dedicated his life just to get revenge. This goes into his VO which is the main complaint from many about this rework. All his lines were prompting people to fight, inspirational quotes and lines delivered in a deadpan voice. But all his lines took double meaning once you considered his lore and theme. He offers a chance at survival, a chance of being remembered as a great warrior of history, but you will only realise the cost far after you accepted it. His very name was arguably a pun on the word atrocity. He was a monster in every sense of the word. \n\nThis combined with his sheer impact literally determining the fate of wars spiked a ton of interest and fan theories into what he was doing, why he was doing it. A picture of his head appeared on jax's splash and people got excited and made theories on what it meant. Then eventually it was removed and we were left in the dark.\n\nThe new aatrox is far less subtle (the old one wasn't very subtle to begin with) then the old aatrox, constantly screaming that he will kill things, that he is eager to fight that he was betrayed and trapped. He is very blatant about the type of character he is and the fact that he now has a sympathetic past takes away from the monstrous personality the old aatrox used to have and humanises him. You are meant to feel sympathetic for the new aatrox, that he isn't just a loud mouthed guy that is 80% of his lines that just wants to kill people. Unless there is some major plot twist in the actual bio he is essentially renekton a character with a noble purpose that was driven to madness by pain and captivity and wants to take it out on the world and the ones that did it too him. \n\nIs this bad character design. No. His character is perfectly fine. But it is not the Aatrox we knew for the past 5 years, there is nothing remotely in common between the two characters other than they were skilled swordsman. And that blatant removal of a character that people theorised over for 5 years is the problem with this rework and frankly just makes it a huge disappointment. Was his kit stuffed yes. But the old aatrox could of easily fitted into the new lore without a personality or a background change, hell it could of been used to say the darkins were intentionally destabilising the world while they waited for their revenge, or that they were using the wars to build up power for the coming conflict. This disregard for how a character was in the past needs to stop. People enjoy characters just as much as their gameplay and a attempt to at least preserve their character should be made for future reworks. The old aatrox is dead now. Not changed, just removed from the game and everything interesting about him went with it. Instead we have another renekton, a loud, insane character because of a tragic backstory. This did not make the game feel \"fresh\" it just removed a unique character from the game entirely and replaced him. \n\nThe real pain was that the visual update didn't even need to happen and that it was forced on because you guys took aatrox and remade him into what you guys wanted him to be instead of what he was. There wasn't even the attempt to catch any of his old lore even though you guys admitted it yourselves that aatrox had one of the more popular themes in the game. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/QgNJVHDnH94?t=36m39s\n\nI knew this would happen and that there was no way you would keep his old lore (you can even go through my comment history) after the blunder of a lore rework that was varus. Guess i was right.

But from what I've pieced together, this new iteration of Aatrox is someone lost in despair, barely able to recognize himself? He's a monster, and he recognizes it, but he's lost in that fury and cannot help but let it spread outward to hurt everyone, because it's consuming him, and inflicting it upon others is the only way to stave off that hunger?\n\nThat's not a bad character design.\n\nSee, the thing is, the tranquil fury of the _old_ Aatrox wasn't a bad design either.\n\nThe difference is, old Aatrox was unique. No other champion has that sort of personality, where they live with fury and anger, but they understand that and remain emotionally in control.\n\nThis new Aatrox? Well, yeah, it's not a bad character design, either.\n\nBut it wasn't a bad character design when you guys used it for _Renekton or Sion_ either.\n\nI know it's not exactly the same thing. But there are parallels, oh so _many_ parallels here. Aatrox even points out that Renekton can understand his pain.\n\nUsing  the old Aatrox personality, that of a being with a need for revenge, but one who had _mastered his fury and was not emotionally driven_, would have been much more compelling, and would have really given him the feeling of being ancient, so very old that he had mastered himself completely, a sort of 'dark Buddha' almost.\n\nInstead, we get a personality we've seen done better before.\n\nIt's just disappointing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Foreman Grills","date":"2018-06-15T15:57:33.222+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":">Hey I really sorry you feel this way.

Everyone on the team knew Aatrox was loved by a very, very small but very, very loyal group of fans. Unfortunately, we also knew Aatrox's gameplay was problematic, he was difficult to balance, he was item reliant;\n\nWhy not rework every single assassin and ADC in the game then? Most offensive champions are item reliant. He had a perfectly healthy kit since his first rework. He has never been this mythical drain tank that can just right click and never die when he's even mildly viable. Just look at his recent games in LCK and even high elo; they play for burst.\n\n> his model, lore, and VO weren't up to modern standards.\n\nHis model and VO are still above average looking at all champions. Lore update requires no in-game update. Also, needing an update doesn't justify the deletion. His voiceover is fundamentally changed, many would say downgraded, even if there are more lines.\n\n> And all those elements had to be better interconnected.

But yes it is hard- (crap, I've now got grey hair and a unfun doctor's appointment tomorrow)\n\nHe didn't have to change though. Change is necessary in life, but you can't use a catch all general trend, apply it to a video game, and say \"WELP CHANGE HAS TO HAPPEN.\" That's a half assed attempt to justify something which has no meaning. They could very well delete half the roster and say \"CHANGE IS HARD BUT IT HAS TO HAPPEN.\" \n\n>But that same change, is a part of what makes League great and what makes it feel fresh.\n\n>It sucks to see something you liked change. But that's just it.. Aatrox is not dead. He is not a dead wife. He changed. \n\nHe's effectively gone though. Every single aspect of Aatrox no longer exists.

It's abstract and yes It's a bit different now but I honestly feel if you give him the 30 games it takes to begin to unlock how he really works- how he really feels- you'll begin to get this is still Aatrox.\n\nTalking down to us doesn't change anything. I can say certainly that the abstract feeling is different because he fills a different niche. He's not a bursty, sustainy, fast, fluid duelist that has some aoe but mostly single target damage. He has little burst, little sustain, slow movement, weighted, slow abilities and primarily deals aoe damage. I don't need to play 30 games. Can you imagine anything else like this? \"Devote over 20 hours of your life and I'm sure you'll feel this is better.\" That's actually absurd. If you reworked him with Viktor's kit, I could tell you immediately that he doesn't feel the same. \n\n> Perhaps even more Aatrox than the original Aatrox was Because you can have joy in change and your memories both.\n\nThat's the most meaningless statement I've ever heard.

But I'm asking you, humbly, to give him a real shot.\n\nI gave him a shot, and it doesn't work. He no longer has his impersonal, cultish ideals of conflict; he has a big ego and inconsistent writing. \"I'm so pitiful, BUT IS THAT AN ELECTRIC SQUIRREL HAHAAHAHAH, but what awaits me in the abyss, BUT I. AM. AATROX. THE WORLD ENDER, but what is the point of life, but THERE WAS A MEMEO VAARUS XDDDDDD\" I don't feel that this is the worst recent voice over, but it does follow the trend of having witty, \"funny\" lines unnecessarily, and this is nothing like Aatrox was. The closest is some sadness which we see in a total of one line, which is his joke. \n\n>Fun fact to end with:\nChange. Knowing that change is traumatic and yet it also a part of our game-- is part of the reason I built that thematic into Zoe and Illaoi.

And all those elements had to be better interconnected. \n\nSure man.\n\n>  Would you rather have watched aatrox fall into total irrelevance-- an unsupported, unplayable, &quot;Quit trolling bro&quot; pick? \n\nI'd rather his kit and lore have been expanded upon and, in the case of his kit, been made more healthy and less feast or famine, while still retaining his identity.\n\nI'd rather he still be a dueling skirmisher rather than a supportive CC fighter with quite possibly THE most awful damage in his class (I have a PBE account and I tried him out, his damage, even at full build, is HILARIOUSLY bad). \n\nI'd rather he still be a largely tranquil and poetic persona rather than a screaming bloodthirsty warrior, but with a more expanded voiceover and even lines that broke away from his normal persona to show a greater depth of emotion than what was there. If Aatrox had his old demeanor but still snarled and roared at Zoe, it would be far more impactful.\n  \n>  _**He had to change.**  _\n>  Because change is necessary. But yes it is hard- (crap, I&#x27;ve now got grey hair and a unfun doctor&#x27;s appointment tomorrow)\n\nNo, changing Aatrox's entire identity to be only superficially similar is not necessary, and this is the lie that you and your coworkers peddle to try to shut us up.\n\nChanging Poppy from a skirmisher to a tank was not necessary, she should have remained a skirmisher. It is the same here.\n\n> But that same change, is a part of what makes League great and what makes it feel fresh. \n\nWhatever you have to tell yourself my friend.\n\n> It sucks to see something you liked change.   But that&#x27;s just it.. Aatrox is not dead. He is not a dead wife. He changed.  He is reborn-- yes different than he was-- but the good feeling you had playing him? \n\nYes, he is dead. His personality is different, he no longer fulfills anywhere near the same function in-game. He's dead and gone, and some new guy has his name. \n\n>  **_That _**is what we were trying to keep--- not the voice, not the gameplay loop, not the visuals. \n\nThen you failed at keeping it, because this new champion is not recognizably Aatrox in any fashion.\n\nInteresting how you only really get these strong reactions when you discard the identity of the champion, like in the case of Aatrox now, but never with champions who get reworks with their identities largely intact, like Irelia or Warwick. Why do you think that is?\n\n> ** _That feeling. _**  It&#x27;s abstract and yes It&#x27;s a _bit_ different now but I honestly feel if you give him the 30 games it takes to begin to unlock how he really works- how he really _**feels**_- you&#x27;ll begin to get this is still Aatrox. \n\nYeah, only he gets rick'rolled by any fighter that gets in close with him, has a passive that doesn't synergize with his kit at all (dude the cooldown lowers when you hit people with your spells but LOL you need the CC from your spells to get close but LOL your spells are shit if they are in AA range), and has a personality that is completely contrary to the old one.\n\n> Perhaps even more Aatrox than the original Aatrox was _Because you can have joy in change and your memories both. _\n\nIf the change was good maybe. This change is bad.\n\nI find your argument in defense of your rework to be entirely unconvincing my friend. \n \n> this is not saying the original voice actor was bad-- just he wasn&#x27;t right for the role.  I get that it&#x27;s hard to see how this is true and matches the previous paragraph -- but it&#x27;s true.    The goal was to make a more Aatrox, Aatrox.  Maybe we didn&#x27;t hit that goal for you.  But I&#x27;m asking you, humbly, to give him a real shot.  \n\nWhy? Even if I thought Aatrox's new VO were good (it's okay, nothing incredible like Jhin's, but not awful), it's still not Aatrox, so you disrespecting fans by telling them that it is in fact more Aatrox than old Aatrox when it is quite obviously not (the original intentions of the design team mean literally nothing toward what the real Aatrox is by the way, Aatrox is what he was when he was released to be consumed and interpreted by the fans) is frankly insulting.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Leverette","date":"2018-06-17T23:57:12.067+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=WAAARGHbobo,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=kIocpgQH,comment-id=000200010000,timestamp=2018-06-15T06:27:51.520+0000)\n>\n> Thanks for capturing your feelings calmly. \n> \n> WAAAARGHbobo\n\n(Sorry for the late response, after waiting a day I thought you weren't going to respond at all!)\n\nFirst of all, I'd like to thank you for sticking your neck out like that and responding to me despite how much fire you put yourself through to do so.  It does mean a lot to see that opposing sides can walk toward each other and speak in peaceful, respectful terms.  Based on your response, I want to see if I can help you understand what we feel and why so many people keep responding to you the way that they do despite the positive things that you say.  You're getting a lot of negativity on these forums and I want to try to help us all understand each other so we can coexist as peacefully and healthily as possible.  I can only truly represent the side I'm on, so please know that this is meant to be received as me attempting to clarify people's feelings, **NOT** to attack or berate.  First and foremost, I respect the community AND the Rioters.  I want us to coexist, else we will all crash and burn.  Please continue to strive for coexistence with me.\n\nTo give you the answer upfront: The community feels disrespected.  That's the answer, so things like 'giving new Aatrox a chance' is moot because we already know he'll be fun and that's not the issue.  I will now painstakingly elaborate so we can all stand on the same ground.\n\nWe all agree his kit was difficult to balance and could use fixing.  Changing his personality was never asked for.  Taste is subjective so It's impossible to say \"This new personality is better\" but it is very possible to say \"Thousands have been hurt by this.\"  If you wanted to introduce something new, you're naturally expected to do it as something new, like a new character.  If you're remaking something that already exists, you're naturally expected to preserve what makes it sacred, like their identity.  New content is for new content.  Aatrox is old content.  Let new things be new things; preserve what already is.  That is the unspoken foundation of respect.  If I (for example) complain about Pyke being a support assassin, I will naturally be perceived as disrespecting Riot's right to creatively invent new things and for the community's right to have these new things, then I will take lots of heat for breaking the bond of mutual respect.  The players should not obstruct Riot's creative vision.  Likewise, If you rework an older character while replacing what made him sacred with your own creative vision, you too will be breaking the bond of respect and catch heat for abusing your authority by overwriting the opinions of all whose vision you do not share.  If you fundamentally disagree with the character's identity, you are not the right person to be rebuilding them.  Likewise, if I am just going to complain and bemoan everything about the new changes without offering a positive solution, I should be respectful and keep my negativity to myself.  I'm sure you Rioters would appreciate if we players were more willing to do that, and I sincerely apologize on behalf of the community for how much undeserved hell you guys are put through.  If everyone were more respectful, the world would be brighter.  I want us to focus on moving in that direction.\n\nGaston vs Mufasa:\nGandhi himself encouraged protest and resistance.  Even he believes in these things; so what happens if we strengthen these aspects of his character in an attempt to make him a more Gandhi, Gandhi?  I think the whole world can agree that Gandhi is a legendary historical figure because he was the exact balance of all the things that he was.  As a character writer, you are expected to acknowledge that.  It would be disingenuous to assert that this is a more Aatrox, Aatrox than before.  I know it's tempting to say \"But old Aatrox lacked personality!\" but that was actually his selling point.  He wasn't a _person._   In our eyes, that's what made him unique.  Forcing this non-human entity to behave like just another human is willingly trading a breath of fresh air for something that _literally defines_ the norm: A person.  Your creative vision is sacred to me and I want to see you successfully release this new character and reap the glory it brings you.  I also want the community (myself included!) to enjoy this fun new character concept.  However this character emerges, I can promise you, frankly, that I _will_ play and enjoy him.  His positives are not to be denied.\n\nI want to express one more thing though.  It would mean to me so very much, if 30 games into this new character, we could return to this conversation.  Part of me curses that I'm not important enough to be remembered down the line, or necessarily even be responded to this second time.  I wonder if I'm fit for an \"ambassadorial\" position like I'm trying to take now...\n\nReciprocated Fun Fact:\nMy best friend/roommate's favorite character is Zoe, and she's the only reason he was finally able to start taking the game seriously and begin working on his personal skill and knowledge of the game.  Since season 1 he was nonchalant and stagnant towards League, but he is now improving dramatically and eager to play the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chronabis","date":"2018-06-17T08:08:45.569+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"You did not change him, you made a new champion and called him Aatrox.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Literal Cringe","date":"2018-06-15T16:34:40.830+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":6,"body":"Hey! I just wanted to thank you and your team for what you've done, because I really love the new Aatrox. It feels like a continuation of the of his prior self, and I think a lot of people have missed out on that.\n\nI've read countless posts of people claiming that the Reworked Aatrox is just some meathead whose only goal is to kill everything, and that's the only characteristic that his new persona has. It's like they've missed all of the lines that he has when he's alone. These softer spoken words have so much more of an impact than his old lines(in my opinion). I almost feel like when he's out of combat, these lines bring him back to his collected, more cooled off self, but the moment he gets into combat he's reminded of what made him so angry. To disregard these lines would be to miss out on so much of his new character, and it's a shame not to take them into account. \n\nIs it so hard to believe that this more enraged version of him is the \"I've been betrayed by the humans and want to exact revenge\"That would have come after his elegant warlike phase? It makes sense to me that his new kit is built around destroying everything, because if I had been locked up in a weapon for a crap ton of time by the people I originally was sided with, I would be pissed to! Who wouldn't?? I feel like the Aatrox that we're seeing now is Riots way of catching us up on what really happened to the Darkin, not replacing him all together, and I really appreciate that, even if it was unintentional. Even the removal of the banner wings makes sense within the lore; there's no one he wants to help in battle, no one to lead, so why would he have them? Everyone who betrayed him must be punished for their actions. To say he's completely different character is just unrealistic, and its rough to see everyone being so spiteful when, in my opinion, you've given him a story, a timeline, and a purpose within the lore, and I absolutely love it. \n\nIn regards to his kit, oh man does it feel nice! It's a little clunky here or there, but when you land his abilities and the opponents just get crushed, PHEW. That's good. I like the idea that he can't move during his Q, which forces the player to learn to use his E and W correctly, or suffer not doing damage. That's not something you normally see, and I think it's a very cool mechanic that will define a good Aatrox from an amazing Aatrox, and I'm super excited to practice my butt off to make everyone else see how great he is!\n\nThanks again, and keep up the fantastic work!\n\nReformedOsMoses {{champion:266}}","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"WarWork","date":"2018-06-14T20:01:12.396+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Why the accent tho I feel that's the elephant in the room.

We have seen to many examples of this already. The first one that I experienced was Fiora who was in a similar state as old Aatrox, a good champion in need of \"quality of life\" changes but not a gameplay redesign and much less a visual, voice and story redesign but that's what we got anyway. So I've said in the past be careful what you wish for...And now you know why.\n\nSince Kayn was introduced, what Aatrox' lore described as a Darkin was at odds with the new concept of Rhaast. Before Darkin were ancient mysterious warriors, now they are sentient weapons. This is a drastic change for Aatrox, while Kayn and Rhaast were designed with this concept in mind, Aatrox was originally introduced as a legendary warrior but now that this has been scrapped, who is Aatrox' \"Kayn\"? I think this is what demanded a character change for the new Champion.\n\nDimiondo nailed it in his post though I would add to it: Old Aatrox was not a human character and by that I mean human emotion don't fit well with him. He was more of an embodied spirit, a spirit of war, blood shed and massacre. No anger, hatred or remorse are described in his lore, no reason for choosing the side of the war he backed. There is, however, a voiceover line that expresses pride IIRC \"This is no mere massacre, this is my masterwork\".\n\nThe last thing I would like to point out is that a reason for the changes that is constantly pointed it out doesn't hold true. Old Aatrox' was hard to balance and was unhealthy for the game. This can be said about many other champions that are constantly in patch notes as the balance team refuses to give up on them, Janna in particular seems to be hard to balance and yet her kit hasn't been replaced.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Reformedfindlay","date":"2018-06-14T03:34:48.840+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":11,"body":"no the voice acting is fucking awful.\n\nIt's reminiscent of old sion but aatrox wasn't meant to be some sort of arnold schwarzenegger joke.","replies":[{"poster":"yay nibbers","date":"2018-06-14T11:02:24.391+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":4,"body":">aatrox wasn't meant to be some sort of arnold schwarzenegger joke.\n\nGood thing that's not what he is then.","replies":[]}]}]}
