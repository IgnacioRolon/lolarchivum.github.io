This would add a whole different level of complexity to the game and way of thinking. Things that seemed too slow before and would cost you your life now could be used.

If they made it adaptive then it would see more play without a doubt. Essence reaver has always been under performing if I remember correctly expect when a champion was super mana hungry and even then it wasnt always a first buy.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"WukongMain","date":"2019-01-09T01:46:17.096+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"an item for feeders!\n\n\"Every time you die Gain +5% Damage, This stacks infinitely\"\nAll stacks are lost upon getting a kill or assist.","replies":[{"poster":"Tahminatrix ","date":"2019-01-09T04:23:35.380+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=LuciferDraco,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=J7GbRrRy,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2019-01-09T01:46:17.096+0000)\n>\n> an item for feeders!\n> \n> &quot;Every time you die Gain +5% Damage, This stacks infinitely&quot;\n> All stacks are lost upon getting a kill or assist.\n\nSo ...int sion taking down towers does 5% more dmg to towers per death.\n\nLets do it :D\n","replies":[{"poster":"WukongMain","date":"2019-01-09T09:10:25.271+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"new item for inters!!\n\neverytime you die you gain a +5% damage reduction bonus that stacks infinitely.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
