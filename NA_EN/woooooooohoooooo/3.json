It&#x27;s refreshing to see something as Eldritch and purely evil as The Void.\n\nCosmic horror and 'pure evil' are mutually exclusive things.\n\nThe hallmark of cosmic horror is that it's amoral and often completely oblivious to the destruction it causes.  It's like a dude destroying an anthill to repave his driveway.  There's no malice in the destruction of all those ants, the guy might not have even noticed they exist.\n\nPure evil is for demons.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Robertsmash","date":"2018-03-02T19:06:35.044+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":">a God-warrior as champion of Shurima\n\n{{champion:268}} {{champion:75}} {{champion:58}} {{champion:101}} Are god warriors not Ascended?","replies":[{"poster":"Nylisa","date":"2018-03-02T19:08:52.232+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"that's actually a very good point that i didn't think about!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"HalfTangible","date":"2018-03-03T19:18:13.847+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"...

Possible but imo unlikely.\n\nThe entire point of unleashing the Void was to kill the (i think a dozen?) Ascended that had come to destroy Icathia. If anyone was around for that it would be Nasus or Renekton, and the former noted that Sivir's blade once belonged to the leader of the Ascended Host (who I think was a cat lady like the one in the story?). But Bloodlines implied that Nasus was there when that leader perished, and we never see anyone like Nasus in Where Icathia Once Stood. And I can't honestly imagine that Nasus would abandon the other Ascended while there was a chance to stop the Void (see the bird-man's last attempts)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Chromatic Eagle","date":"2018-03-02T23:38:09.205+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Aren't god-warriors the ascendants?","replies":[{"poster":"Nylisa","date":"2018-03-02T23:46:34.546+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Chromatic Eagle,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=dUc7ZKVN,comment-id=00010003,timestamp=2018-03-02T23:38:09.205+0000)\n>\n> Aren&#x27;t god-warriors the ascendants?\n\nyep thats what i've missed here it seems.but do we know any of them from that time? where the events of \"where Icathia once stood\" took place.","replies":[{"poster":"Chromatic Eagle","date":"2018-03-03T00:00:56.788+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't think so, except that the Lion girl might be Setaka.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"SpecterVonBaren","date":"2018-03-02T20:52:52.400+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You should read 'The Haunter of the Dark' by Lovecraft, I'm very confident  its the inspiration for that.","replies":[{"poster":"Nylisa","date":"2018-03-02T21:08:06.483+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i actually been wanting to Read that! thanks for reminding me. its a good time now with this void lore update.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Sharjo","date":"2018-03-02T18:17:46.001+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's something unequivically terrifying about the prospect of complete and total erasure in a universe that has what is effectively a confirmed afterlife, whatever that may be. \n\nGood lore.","replies":[{"poster":"HalfTangible","date":"2018-03-03T19:22:57.865+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"...
