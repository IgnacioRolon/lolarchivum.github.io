As someone who consistently enjoys the lore updates I usually just dismiss these posts or try to argue with them, but after recent events I&rsquo;ve started to formulate this half-baked theory.  I&rsquo;m not an expert, nor am I a good writer, but here&rsquo;s what I think. \r\n\r\nThe largest problem with a storytelling format like League of Legends is the fact that every character has to (theoretically) be given the same amount of focus and all characters receive the same (gradual) treatment. \r\n\r\nIn comic books a lot of villains have these wild outlandish plans, and you know more or less the hero will eventually save the day (in some cases). However the villains aren&rsquo;t just villains, good comic book villains serve as foils and other literary devices to the heroes. \r\n\r\nKeep in mind that when I say &ldquo;villains&rdquo; and &ldquo;heroes&rdquo; I really mean &ldquo;main character&rdquo; and &ldquo;side characters&rdquo; \r\n\r\nBatman I would say has the most infamous rogues gallery, and over time his villains and his allies have grown as well, All of the robins have seen development as solo protagonists but at the end of the day it all comes back to Batman. \r\n\r\nLeague of Legends can&rsquo;t really have a Batman so to speak, they have to give all 130+ champions an independent voice and perspective on the world.  \r\n\r\nI think that&rsquo;s why the Void and Shadow Isles champions tend to be the most consistently liked when it comes to lore.  You don&rsquo;t really need an emotional arc or anything like that when you&rsquo;re writing for Cho&rsquo;Gath or Rek&rsquo;Sai.  In fact Rek&rsquo;Sai&rsquo;s color story was told from another perspective entirely besides her own. \r\n\r\nPoint is the more clear cut villainous champions of LoL usually have well recieved lore because they are the forever antagonists of League of Legends, people don&rsquo;t root for them because they&rsquo;re sympathetic or strike a chord, they root for them because they&rsquo;re fucking badass bad guys. \r\n\r\nSo when you have the rest of the cast as each being a sort of morally grey protagonist with their own depth and perspective you get a lot more arguments from people when it comes time for their lore to be revisited because their lore is much more vulnerable to the tiniest change in nuance spoiling all of it for some people. \r\n\r\nSo with all these bios Riot is trying to turn some of the champions who may have been at first morally complex or sympathetic into more clear-cut visages of horror or might then people tend to get very miffed.\r\n\r\nAnyway, just my little rant based on things I&rsquo;ve observed.","replies":[{"poster":"Dreamspitter","date":"2017-11-27T02:56:52.389+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I mean to be highly technical...everyone's the hero of their own story.

One day, Vayne realized that she loved Frey like a mother, but her emotions of familial love were so tangled with pain and tainted by trauma, Vayne fought them as she would any beast out to hurt her.\n\nWell I mean, if you stare into the abyss long enough....it stares into you. Her world has become stark black and white. Some of this, mind you, might stem from her Demacian upbrining. The irony is perhaps figures like {{champion:266}} and {{champion:28}}  might actually admire her for her savagery. Of course, she would never willingly join them.\n\n\n\nSee when she smiled after killing the woman who became like mother -maybe even lover for their heresy of being a werewolf? That's when she began to understand.\n\n https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h67JpMyrOVE\n\nThose who truly understand, realize she has no right to let them live. No sacrifice is too great. No treachery too small.\n\n\nWHAT WOULD BE INTERESTING would be to see{{champion:67}}  interaction with {{champion:59}} and {{champion:102}} . Further interaction with {{champion:236}} beyond Harrowing would be interesting, seeing how they contrast. \n","replies":[{"poster":"KoKoboto","date":"2017-11-28T14:33:27.602+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sure it can be stark black and white and she could be a Garen, Darius, Camille, but she's not.
