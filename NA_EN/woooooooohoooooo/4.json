Simply that if they didn't, then, it gets a lot less fun trying to piece it all together.  One of the biggest issues I had with the old IoW lore was that they'd often bring champions across space like Malphite, Taric and Kayle/Morgana.  Isn't this the same issue but with time separating them?  If these events happen centuries apart, then...I suppose I don't feel as invested that this isn't some kind of era-defining time in Runeterra, an age of champions so to speak.  I suppose there would be ways to make it work, but I still feel kind of jilted that for some champions, they'd never even have the opportunity to meet.  It kind of allows for fans to fantasize within reason of what two characters with similar power levels would do when they meet, or how they'd interact.  I'm just a bit disappointed, because I had ideas for a massive interconnecting story, that I was writing for league... But I kinda feel like it might be useless to continue any further knowing that there's no chance something like that actually happening.  I... suppose this is really just me being biased because it was a big dream of mine to finish this story...but my favorite thing about the lore was the fact that it was all interconnected and one champions lore could affect another instead of isolated stories.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Scathlocke","date":"2018-02-03T19:32:10.818+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm going to reply here, but I think this covers several parts of the discussion elsewhere in the thread too... :-)\n\nTo be clear: I'm ABSOLUTELY NOT saying that \"champions do not exist all at the same time\". I'm saying that certain stories do not make it clear whether or not specific champions are active in the same place, at the same time.\n\nThis works both ways. If we assume there is a \"now\" (which there is!) and that all ~140 champs are active right now, then they can all potentially interact with one another in whatever ways make for the best and most exciting stories. You can expect to see more and more of that kind of storytelling in the near future.\n\nHowever... if there is a \"now\", then there was a \"past\", and therefore an implied canonical timeline. Riot has told stories set in the past of the timeline - even the Darius comic showed some events from 5 (?) years ago, and as Xenohaz pointed out, Braum has apparently been around for multiple generations. This means either that humans in our setting don't age or die (seems unlikely!) or that we have to assume that some champions are very unlikely to ever interact outside of the game, because the days, weeks, months and years of their lives are gradually being filled up with storylines.\n\nIf we tell a story set 5 years in the past, or an origins story for a champion even further back, then we have to consider the fact that younger champions would be children... or not even born yet. Then you have to literally start working out \"when is now?\" and how old LITERALLY every single champion is, and whether or not they age like regular people.\n\nThat's all I meant :-)\n\nThere is positive movement at Riot towards making internally consistent lore - we're not there yet, but we're making progress. I'd urge everyone not to see this as a limiting factor, but a chance to see more stories which have meaningful connections and an internal logic across all of them.\n\nAnd as always, I welcome your thoughts and feedback on this.

The biggest problem with your thought process is that we know the timeline in the Starwars universe. In league we don't. We know when Qui-Gon was around and we know the decisions he made that caused greater effect in the universe. \n\nLeague needs a \"core\" event time. Not one event but simply a span of 50~ years that the cast were all active; a period where 99% of the cast are all present in the universe. Some can continue on from here some will have been champions long before. The exceptions to this should only be champions that had a huge impact in the creation of another champion, but died before \"core\" event time.\n\nIn this essence Luke meets Qui-Gon in a game that's fine. However Julius Ceaser and Ronda Rousey aren't relevant to the same story, and at that scope they aren't really special anymore.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Scathlocke","date":"2018-02-03T19:33:42.247+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"You make a great point.

As far as we have seen, all the champions that are considered powerful only interact with champions that are related with their own faction... However, when we look at the champions that have less power, their interactions are way more wide and diverse, they are free to travel from one place to other... But the powerfull ones? No, they all are trapped in their own place.","replies":[{"poster":"GreenLore","date":"2018-02-02T20:08:01.596+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thats mostly because most of the big powerhouses are champs that are pretty much centered around their faction.\nThere wouldn't be much of a problem if they were wandering around as long as they don't go out of their way to solve other champions business.","replies":[{"poster":"Ebonmaw Dragon","date":"2018-02-02T20:27:21.418+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=GreenLore,realm=EUW,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=nPiEEh5x,comment-id=0002000100000000,timestamp=2018-02-02T20:08:01.596+0000)\n>\n> Thats mostly because most of the big powerhouses are champs that are pretty much centered around their faction.\n> There wouldn&#x27;t be much of a problem if they were wandering around as long as they don&#x27;t go out of their way to solve other champions business.\n\nExactly and i dont think that is a coincidence that champions with huge power are centered arround their faction, it is a consequence of their power, a thing that could be avoided if they werent that powerfull in first place.
