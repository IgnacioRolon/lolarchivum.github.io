While potentially all of the void champions are timeless, Vel&rsquo;Koz could be the one with the longest rap sheet. \r\n\r\nWhat we know about the Watchers is that they are the masters of the Void. How this is accomplished or to what ends are unclear, but as of writing, the Freljord lore of the early relationship between Iceborn and Watchers ended with the battle on the Howling Abyss.  The Watchers were Imprisoned by a magical bridge built by Ornn.  \r\n\r\nArt in concepts related to the Watchers can be seen as reminiscent of Vel&rsquo;Koz&rsquo; design, large eyes, and tentacles. \r\n\r\nSo I believe that when the Void is revisited in the future, Vel&rsquo;Koz will take a level in Badass and ascend the hierarchies of the Void.  \r\n\r\nMy other question, could the ancient Iceborn be somehow similar to the Ascended of Shurima?","replies":[{"poster":"Fasmodey","date":"2018-06-30T19:41:02.557+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":2,"body":"Well, even if Riot could retcon his lore and change it 180 degree, I doubt that. For reasons...\n\nFirst reason, Vel'Koz with his voice lines doesn't show a strong malevolent personality. Actually, he is curious. He is a champion that wants to understand how things work but lacking morality inevitably pushes him to have terrible actions for learning. His primary goal is not destroying Runeterra, or universe. He just wants to learn, and for that, he destroys. I think he would be against the total annihilation, given his curiosity for knowledge. (Since nothingness excludes knowledge too)\n\nHis obsession for knowledge as well as not giving a damn about anything except knowledge is unique and It shouldn't be removed. And if you don't remove, you can't have a watcher.\n\nOther reason, a watcher champion means HYPE. A hype that would be insane. And It shouldn't be wasted with Vel'Koz when it is already a risky move. You can disappoint readers and waste a potential at the same.\n\nLast reason, even though there are similarities, Vel'Koz doesn't resemble a watcher in appearance that much. In Bard teaser, a watcher has arms, many of them, in one of watcher concepts, there are far more beasty and less alien like compare to Vel'Koz. This gives me the idea that Riot is considering watchers to be unique, rather than retconning a champion to be a watcher.","replies":[{"poster":"WOOOOOOOOHOOOOOO","date":"2018-06-30T20:03:27.735+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"So, that’s rather convincing.

Or whatever the great ancestor of Sejuani was named, were 3 sister/queens battling over the Freljord when the frozen watchers suddenly poped out.\n\nThe watchers offered power and,,,,,,a lot of stuff in exchange for servitude and obedience,  the kicker here is that the Frozen watchers either showed up before Shurima was even founded or at least before Shurima exploded meaning they were doing their own \"iceborn\" ascension at the same time the Shurimian empire were pumping out their sunborn ascendants.\n\n\nHowever the strange thing here is that the Shurimian ascension should make the supplicants infertile as they are far from Human or even related anymore, but its actually 100% certain that the iceborn didnt suffer this issue as there are multiple people in the Freljord carrying the blood, ashe and seju included.\n\n\nWhats more, the Iceborn do not age, at all, they are effectively immortal unless deliberately killed by someone.\n\nBraum and Lissandra being the examples of this, but this puts a strange contrast to the Shurimian Sunborn, for we know that they do age with Nasus being the example, there are multiple mentions of him growing weaker as he ages.\n\n\n....Weak being relative of wrecking one or three armies by himself....hard to know.\n\n\n\nSo given the difference in results between the iceborn creation and the sunborn we can safely say that the creators are not the same.....or that they were doing things differently at least.\n\nHowever its odd, Braum is almost certainly an Iceborn, he does not age or weaken, but Illaoi likes him.\n\nBut she completely hates on the Shurimian Ascended for their defiance of the natural order such as transforming themselves and extending their lives.\n\n\nClearly what was done in the Freljord is very, very different from what happened in Shurima, and the results were rather radically different too just looking at Lissandra and Braum.\n\nThe ability to have children could also be deemed considerable.\n\nSo, whatever the watchers were they were not Targon, for they were apparently monsterous.\n\nThey were not void, for they did not work according to the usual void standards at all.\n\nBut while they did run a totalitarian regime they did also greatly empower the humans under the rule, the iceborn who eventually defeated them in particular.\n\n\nWatchers were a weird bunch, its almost like some manner of \"we must do evil stuff to save the world\" thing was going on with them but they got beaten back by \"ignorant shortsighted idealists\" or whatever the \"badguys\" calls the ones beating them when things fall apart.","replies":[{"poster":"Terozu","date":"2018-07-01T01:28:37.050+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The 3 queens didnt war with each other until after the watchers.\n\nAvarosa and (sejuani sister) decided to rebel, Lissandra still favored them.
