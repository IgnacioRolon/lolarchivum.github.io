Also on the other hand the Marauders (eg Maraduer Ashe, Maraduer Warwick, etc) have similar beliefs to God King Darius that they want to burn things.\r\nThis got me thinking...could the Wardens and Marauders be working with/alongside their respective Kings? It makes sense how GKG is kind of a tyrant and the wardens will be the law and see that his wishes are followed through, and the Marauders would be GKD&rsquo;s assassins, killing people and making distractions.\r\nI&rsquo;m not sure if this has already been said though or confirmed.","replies":[{"poster":"Carnival Knights","date":"2018-07-12T23:41:43.638+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Those skinlines are in a different universe, though I love your theory.","replies":[{"poster":"Warlord Rhinark","date":"2018-07-16T09:43:51.865+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Carnival Knights,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=PEgb9Uu7,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-07-12T23:41:43.638+0000)\n>\n> Those skinlines are in a different universe, though I love your theory.\n\n{{sticker:sg-janna}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Stars Shaper","date":"2018-07-16T09:29:20.416+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We need more of those.\n\nI'm still waiting for Warden Taric.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Speak or Die","date":"2018-07-13T01:07:05.871+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, Jax has a God Skin and a Warden Skin, so it won't work :(","replies":[{"poster":"deemen01","date":"2018-07-16T09:27:20.745+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Welp...just realised that.","replies":[]}]}]}
