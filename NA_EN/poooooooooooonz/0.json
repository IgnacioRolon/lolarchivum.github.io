Every single game my ping sits around 1800 ping once the game is about 1 minute in. It spikes up to well over 3000++ ping and holds for quite some time.\r\n\r\nI played all day yesterday pre-patch with no problems. Never having this issue. I've done everything on my end including call my ISP and there are no issues. Something in the new patch is causing this.\r\n\r\nNothing lags at all until I GET INTO THE GAME. Then Ventrilo, League, Browsers everything spikes and eats shit and lags.\r\n\r\nRiot you need to get on this, I've read a few other posts as well.\r\n\r\nI turned off peer2peer sharing within League. Still lags. Tried on lolping.org says I should have about 115ping but in reality I always have aroun 40-60ping. Now after this patch again from 1800-3000+++","replies":[{"poster":"Snakzilla","date":"2017-01-25T21:45:26.021+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm having the same issue since the last nights patch, my ping is normal until minions get to the middle of the lanes and that's where it all goes down hill. Ping never goes under like 200 but it goes all over the place up to 2k+. Anything else that I'm trying to run that requires internet such as a web browser lags too while playing the game. I have already made a post and the only response I got from the player support was to try troubleshooting my connection.","replies":[{"poster":"Uncle Jess","date":"2017-01-26T08:10:22.416+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"SAME.

Tried everything on my end. This is a riot end issue 100% not on my end. Literally started right after the patch considering I've been playing A LOT the last few weeks with no issues, and coincidently this starts after a patch..","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Uncle Jess","date":"2017-01-26T08:09:03.202+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same exact problem here.

I strongly recommend using a networking app called [**WinMTR**](http://winmtr.net/) to run this. Simply boot up the application and plug **104.160.131.1** into the host field, then start the trace! After the trace has gone on for 5 minutes or longer, you can export the results *as text* and paste them in a reply to me.\n\nIf you encounter issues with these steps, let me know!","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
