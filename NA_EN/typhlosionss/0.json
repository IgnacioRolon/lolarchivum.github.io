I tried to change my password, but it seems the hacker changed both my username, password, and e-mail adress. Curiously whoever did it has not played any games on my account as you can see here http://www.lolking.net/summoner/euw/27002927#profile. The last game I played was the Aatrox one that didnt go so well :P. I contacted riot right away on Saturday the 21st and one of their customer support specialists Wolf Fang contacted me and gave me a series of questions to answer. I answered all of them and even gave them the credit card number used for my 2 most recent purchases of RP and a LoL Replay file of the last ranked game I had played on Wukong. After I replied he sent me another list of questions stating that it was necessary to completely verify my ownership. So again I answered all of the questions to the best of my ability. Some of the questions were a little too hard to answer. For instance, \"The first five champions you purchased\". I told him I remembered Irelia was one of my first purchases and the frostblade irelia skin was the first skin I ever bought. I thought this would be enough information, but apparently not. It has now been approximately 72 hours since I replied to the last e-mail sent from Wolf Fang and I have not recieved a single word back. I need advice on what to do at this point because I honestly don't believe it takes 3 days to verify whether I am the true owner of the account (I've provided the credit card number I used to purchase RP on the account, an e-mail from a tribunal account I was shamefully the defendant of which gave me a warning for having a negative attitude, and In game and after game screenshots of recent games before I got hacked). I don't know if Wolf Fang is sick or what happened to him but it seems something is wrong because I really don't think it should take this long especially because I gave more than enough information to prove the account is mine. I also have a youtube channel where I have posted my LoL gameplays on that acccount since I started playing 7 months ago, which you can find here www.youtube.com/Skatefordays1. I have spent over 300$ on this account so I would really hate to lose it just because one of the support specialists wasn't paying attention or was sick. I would really like your guys' advice and if a rioter could help me I would be eternally grateful.\r\n\r\nTL;DR: My Account got hacked and I gave more than enough information to riot to prove that the account is mine, but as far as I can tell they aren't doing much about it or I'm just mistaken and these things take weeks to change. Really need some advice, preferably from a rioter.","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2013-09-25T20:58:46.224+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey  Typhlosionss!\n\nI read your \"wall of text crit you for 9000\" message, and subsequently investigated this issue for you.  I found the ticket you opened, and went ahead and performed an in-depth audit of your account.  From this audit, I was able to verify that your account was compromised, and the email address was changed.  After further investigation, I worked with Wolf Fang (please keep in mind they have days they are off from work as well!) and you should have a response back in your ticket momentarily.\n\nPlease keep in mind that we do take accusations of Account Theft incredibly seriously, and that is why we ask for a wealth of information, so that we can verify the original ownership of the account.  I do sincerely apologize for any frustration or aggravation this may have caused.\n\nI wish you the best of luck in all your future games!","replies":[{"poster":"Typhlosionss","date":"2013-09-26T10:10:47.596+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dear DArt, \n\nI got your e-mail yesterday and was able to change my password. The only thing I noticed was all my friends have been deleted from my friends list and I was wondering if there was some way I could recover these? Other than that everything is fine and I actually played a game yesterday that went pretty well :).And I wasn't frustrated, I was just a little worried that Wolf Fang didn't recieve my e-mails since he didn't reply for so long.  Thanks for all your help.\n\nSincerely, Ramsey Mekdaschi,","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2013-09-27T22:48:50.012+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Typhlosionss,\n\nThat really, really sucks.  I'm sorry :(  Unfortunately, we do not have a full history of your friends list saved in our database.  Therefore, you will need to start re-adding people from memory.  I understand how frustrating this can be, and I do sincerely apologize for any aggravation this may cause.\n\nI wish you the best of luck in all your future games though!  ^.^","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Oniii Chan","date":"2013-09-25T08:15:51.196+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I personally believe you gave a decent amount of information that is suitable for the task of receiving back your account. I'm sure they can do some basic works of finding out the ip address that you were using that account on mostly and do some cross reference upon that. Even though this is a stretch but if you had any friends that were local that you played with - possibily involve them to vouch for you?\n\nAlso, if I'm correct- they should have your number as well - since I'm sure that is requested in the form of inserting your credit card for purchases. So they can send a verify code of some sort? Unless they stole your phone number too than I'm sure that can do some justice.\n","replies":[{"poster":"Typhlosionss","date":"2013-09-25T08:30:31.508+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I gave more than a decent amount, the credit card number, the tribunal case from April, the LoL Replay file, and screenshots of after game results. I already gave them my IP, told them what friends have used the account (only one about 6 months ago and he doesn't even play anymore). The problem isn't that they're being difficult it's that they aren't replying at all. I even wrote Wolf Fang another e-mail after he didn't reply for two days, asking if he got the reply I sent him and he never responded to that either. It's just very mysterious and strange. And that's why I'm worrying I lost 300$ and a gigantic amount of time.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Cypherous","date":"2013-09-25T07:19:53.731+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"These things do take a while to process so just hang in there and riot will get it resolved","replies":[{"poster":"Typhlosionss","date":"2013-09-25T07:29:02.472+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah ok thanks for the reassurance, but they really should reply and say, \"We are looking into this and will get back to you as soon as the problem has been resolved.\" Not just leave you to sweat it out wondering why they aren't replying at all.
