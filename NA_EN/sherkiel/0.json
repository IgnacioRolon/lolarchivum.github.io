The server has no way of determining why you've disconnected, as it simply sees a disconnection, which means your client stops communicating with the server entirely.\n\nMost of these issues are caused by local network settings that conflict with League, so I recommend working through our [connection guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to ensure your settings are good. Let me know the results of those steps.","replies":[]}]}
