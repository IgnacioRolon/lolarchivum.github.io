The skins shouldn't be released in a poor state because you were worried what changes it would make to other skins. If you are going to sell these skins to the community, at least do us the favor of making them worth buying. We will wait while you make sure they function properly. Instead of screwing us over, plan a starting time on the skins for an earlier date. \n\nAn example of rushed BS skins, Battlecast Skarner vs Battlecast Chogath, I know I have spoke up about him a lot but he was so damn underwhelming that I honestly don't think I'll ever get my hopes up for a skin again. Battlecast Chogath came out a while ago and is pretty on par for a legendary, all his skills have flashy effects, his model and textures are nice and shiney/glowy, etc. Skarner is kind of glowy, but his Q is less visible than a 975 or cheaper skin for him, his W is basically a bubble while the rest of his skins get a crystal armor shell, the rest of the E's are bigger and flashier, and the passive stacks on battlecast are hardly noticeable. The only fancy thing about Battlecast Skarner is his ultimate. Battlecast Skarner should have been a 1350 and we all know it. A small minority is buying that skin. \n\nAnyway, People mentioned ALL of the above points on the PBE and NONE of them were even touched. It was seriously the most frustrating experience I have had giving feedback about anything League related because as mentioned above, it felt like it was too late to make any changes. That thread was only pinned for 2-3 weeks at most and then he was pushed through. That is a terrible amount of time to receive feedback, make changes, and then receive feedback again. There was no reason the battlecast skins needed to be rushed because there was no event, it was just sheer laziness in my opinion. \n\nThe boards community is the group that is giving feedback on skins, bugs, gameplay, champions, etc. Yet a lot of us feel ignored. I remember when I first got on GD it felt like our opinion was worth something, yet more and more all I see on Boards is people frustrated that we are getting ignored. As much as I love League and think that the skins can look good, I don't feel like it is worth investing any more of my cash into if we just get ignored when we give you feed back like you guys request. If you guys are going to ignore our feedback, just shut the boards down.

So texture is a whole completely different expertise than skin making? Can't help but feel that there being two separate teams may lead to hilarious miscommunication where Jinx's smooth beautiful skin becomes a wrinkled old lady's.\n> \n> \n> But can we all just shake hands and just agree on one crucial objective fact? Zac needs a new skin, something that changes him beyond *\"purple Zac with some whippy things\"* (roach swarm Zac? stitched zombie Zac?)\n> -------------------------------\n> On another note, do you think Wukong's new skin posed a little problem for making skins for certain champions?\n> \n> At the price the skin team or whoever priced him at, he was...really underwhelming. I guess it didn't help that he's not all that popular a champion to begin with, but his kit really doesn't lend itself all too well to legendary skins.\n> \n> \n> I mean, compared to your average AP champion with all their snazzy spells and animations, what does a kit like Wukong's have to work with that makes it worth that price? A lot of his kit is just the ways a monkey man can swing his stick.\n> \n> \n> Do you plan on making legendary skins for champions with little to nothing to work with in the future? The most you can do is just make a champion built around some stupid meme like dunking and playing that up. I challenge you to make, say...a skin for Xin Zhao interesting enough to be legendary. \n\nI...I hope Jinx's skin never ends up looking like an old lady's, haha. Having two teams is actually pretty helpful for us on skins. We wouldn't otherwise have enough time to update older skins, since we're usually pretty packed with new content. Champion Update is also responsible for reworks, so they've got a lot on their plate, too. \n\nI absolutely agree with you that Zac needs a new skin. While I can't say if there's a skin in the works or not, I can tell you that he's a champion we're aware of that needs a new skin. Jinx is also high on that list. \n\nIn regards to Wukong, I think you mean Underworld Wukong.  That skin wasn't legendary, it was 1350 RP. I'm sorry you felt he was underwhelming. About a year and a half ago, we discussed price tiers for content coming out from that point on. It detailed what kind of work went into each price tier. You can check it out [here](http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=3328361). \n\nOne of the reasons he was priced more than a 975 (as listed in that link up there) was because all of his VO had voice processing. That's generally something that separates a 975 RP skin from a 1350 RP skin. He also had a new model and texture, a new recall animation, and new particles. \n\nAgain, I can't say what we've got planned, but I do agree with you that making a legendary skin for someone who is melee, let's say Garen, is definitely harder than making a legendary for someone who is particle heavy, like Veigar. I think it can be done, but it would definitely take a lot of thought and planning. Xin Zhao is definitely on the more difficult end of the spectrum, like you're implying.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2014-12-01T22:54:31.114+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Okay now it gets all convoluted.

I'm horrid with balance, numbers and everything related to gameplay balance and health. It's probably a really good thing I only help make things look pretty. >_>\n\nAs a Sona main, I can understand where you're coming from. I actually dropped her for Nami for a long time 'cause I didn't feel as powerful/successful with Sona until her rework. Now, I play her a crap ton 'cause let's be honest, Lich Bane Sona does a lot of damage. \n\nYou hit the nail right on the head by saying 'people hate change.' I'll be the first to admit that I can be one of those people. (I was super pissed when we changed the name of Lux's ultimate... buuuut, I learned to deal with it.) I know we've been trying to put more changes on the PBE sooner (i.e. Sejuani changes most recently) to get things out there, and let players talk about/play with the changes rather than springing them on live and having people blindsided in game, especially ranked. \n\nI can understand your frustration, and it's likely echoed by more players.
