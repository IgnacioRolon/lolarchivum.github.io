I think it's really great and I love how so many champions were addressed at 9.4. However, what about Udyr {{champion:77}} ?\r\n\r\nYes, I've seen lots of talk about it on Reddit, I know it's a hard project since his 4 stances make it tough to make a good visual update and he has an ultimate skin but, just because it's hard, are you suggesting that he should be ignored? It really saddens me how outdated his visuals and animations (besides Spirit Guard) are compared to others. In addition, even though I absolutely adore Spirit Guard I don't think you can compare Spirit Guard's animations to Elementalist Lux' animations. It's a season 3 (or 4?) skin.\r\n\r\nI just think, it's about time, we start showing Udyr some love as well.\r\nEven if it's hard, it's something that has to be done. He doesn't just look outdated, he looks really bad compared to other champions.","replies":[{"poster":"Caitlyn FTW","date":"2019-02-21T09:19:18.768+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Kelg","date":"2019-02-21T10:08:28.356+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Kamille W,realm=EUW,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=5F6lhoZl,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2019-02-21T09:19:18.768+0000)\n>\n> They are going to update {{champion:82}} first. \n\nthe time as come and so have i","replies":[]}]}]}
