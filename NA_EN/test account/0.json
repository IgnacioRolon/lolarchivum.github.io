But as of late, looking at the PBE and the recent changes you've made, it's really difficult to get any sort of idea what exactly you mean by all that. Especially given it feels like you're actively trying to weaken all but a handful of champions in specific roles, which I'm sure can't possibly be the case. Your patch notes specifically call out certain champions as being \"fun and balanced\" while simultaneously nerfing other very similar champions. The issue is mobility creep has been openly acknowledged, but the past few new champions have all had mobility in one form or another. In some cases, oodles of it.\r\n\r\nI'm not looking to use this post to complain, decry decisions you've made on the PBE or in recent patches, or point fingers at new champions and call them the end of the world.

And if so, what is that strategic diversity, if not champion variety?\r\n\r\n* How exactly do you plan on dealing with mobility creep? Do you even think it's still a problem, or should we just expect every low-mobility character to eventually be reworked to keep up? If you're planning on doing something about it, but it's not going to be for a long, long time coming -- could you just tell us? Please?\r\n\r\nFinally: Where are you taking this?

How do you want or expect this season to play out?\n\nWe want more champ diversity. A lot of the preseason changes were made with the goal of having games play out differently. Overall we are happy with the changes made to towers, objectives and the jungle, but it hasn't yet created the space for more champs. (I should add at least within one region - if you look world-wide, diversity is preety good, but that's largely because different champs are getting played in different parts of the world.) We knew the changes would be disruptive, meaning it might take players a few patches to explore the best strategies to use in the new environment, but things are starting to settle in now and diversity isn't where we want it to be.\n\n>When you refer to strategic diversity, do you mean that you want any and all champions to be a common and regular pick, their frequency only truly decided by their teamcomp?

And if so, what is that strategic diversity, if not champion variety?\n\nStrategic diversity refers both to champs and to the game itself. If every game is won with a similar comp (even if the champs are different) or every games be becomes a 5 dragon stack, then the risk still exists that the third game you play feels exactly like the previous two. On the topic of champ diversity specifically, it's not a reasonable expectation or a goal to have every champ played equally. Champs have different play styles and themes and that all factors in. But we can do better than we do today.\n\n> How exactly do you plan on dealing with mobility creep?

Roles that need a lot of mobility, like assassins, aren't a huge problem, but roles that already bring a lot to the table, especially mages and ADCs, can be. Even with these it doesn't need to be an ironclad rule that they can't dash, but they do need to pay for it elsewhere in their power budget. For these champs, we are less likely to nerf their movement mechanic and more likely to reduce their damage, survivability or control to pay for the mechanic.","replies":[{"poster":"Done25","date":"2015-02-22T16:38:39.173+0000","up_votes":35,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Ghostcrawler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=2TavB1Ax,comment-id=0016,timestamp=2015-02-22T16:15:05.754+0000) doesn't need to be an ironclad rule that they can't dash, but they do need to pay for it elsewhere in their power budget.

Why was Kalista even let into testing with her passive if this is the case? Was counterplay or other champions not taken into consideration? Was the repeated complaints of not being able to get to ADCs with melee champions the entire reason she was made? Also look into my other thread where I am asking why ADC's standard build path offsets their stat based weakness of having the lowest MS in the game thus completely removing melee's superior MS from the equation by making them faster than melee at 1/4 build. \n\nKalista's kit without her passive is great IMO but adding that passive just made the community even more anger than before. The idea was to train people to attack move/attack cancel with her so they become better at ADCs, this backfired completely and has caused many problems that were moderate to become severe. By mid champion concept I could have told you that, it is a great ideal but mechanically it causes problems that are easily foreseeable. Did no one look at the idea besides the designer? The ideal could have been realized through a training program meant to improve players which would have IP rewards. This would also have been much better for the games health overall as then future training and IP rewards could be put in the game to promote constant player improvement, alas the mechanic is here to stay until she will be reworked (if ever) to improve the games health. \n\nI believe the people at Riot are doing the same mistake I did when I was working on my game in college, They are looking at what is interesting and how  it could be implemented without seeing the big picture and forgetting steps along the way such as that certain champions are not up to the par that they want so they are not making preemptive measures to insure that the champion in the future can be buffed while trying to accept that the champions that are not up to speed need to be taken into account. Short version Rioters are looking at the game entirely from the designer point of view and not from the perspective of the player. I made this mistake and believed the experience of Rioters would make this a non issue but seeing some of the things come out of late I have fear that they are not playing the game enough to realize what is happening. Its not a balance problem its a design flaw that will continue to increase if there is not either more checks put in place during champion development or more interaction in  champion development by the Rioters who play the game much more frequently and are higher in game mechanical skill and knowledge.\n\nI have IMO poor to moderate mechanical skill but moderate to moderate-high mechanical knowledge in regards to champion interaction. (scale of none to great) There is nothing wrong with interesting mechanics (in fact its great and should be encouraged) but there needs to be some more checks in place during champion conception to iteration.\n\nI'm not saying CertainlyT is a bad designer (far from it, though his champions do have the same issues) i'm saying that the effect of this mishap could have been avoided with some precautions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Altricad","date":"2015-02-22T16:29:50.517+0000","up_votes":20,"down_votes":1,"body":"First of all, Thank you for responding to this post\n\nAnd second of all I'm gonna quote exactly what you said\n\n\n\"mages and adc\" need to pay for mobility. \n\nThe number 1 priority/frustration with everyone is without a doubt {{champion:429}} , the newest adc released\n\nI'm gonna ask you straight up, are there gonna be any power-shifts/nerfs/changes to her in the 5.5 patch?

So much so that few people anymore want to even touch it and you have been forced to implement some PBE stat giver device to try to get players to play it more and give you more info.

You're looking at a problem (the jungle tends to be dominated by a few particular champions and strategies) and are focusing on only one solution (change the jungle) instead of other possible solutions (change the champions). As such, you constantly make changes that do nothing but make the strong junglers strong and the weak junglers weak. For example, the smite change hurts less mobile champions more than the mobile champions currently dominating the scene.\n\n> I frequently think about and ask others in the office: what would happen to the game if we (Riot) took our hands off the wheel for a year?

And Riot already has the example of this.\n\nIn season 4 there were 3 \"new\" jungle items. (feral flare was added later) But mostly let's look at the two more \"main\" ones. (ie not the ap one)\n\nElder Lizard and Ancient Golem. As the year went on each was buffed up and down here and there to try and find a balance between the two. Much like in S 5 we saw that more top jungle champions take warrior enchant. Well these are the same champions that took Elder Lizard in S4. At one point Ancient Golem was stronger, so we saw less Elder Lizard in S4. But we saw the SAME junglers Lee, Rengar, J4, ect... pick up Ancient Golem instead. They stayed towards the top no because Elder Lizard or Ancient Golem were stronger, but because THEIR kits were better in the jungle.\n\nNow we fast forward a full season into S5 and we see the same issues that happened in S4. Assassin-ish junglers with high mobility and strong utility are on top. (mostly the same ones) \n\nAt this point it's clear that the jungle **ITEMS** are not the issue. It's the jungle champions that are allowed to be over loaded (strong kits, high mobility, utility, high damage, ect..). So each time a \"jungle tweak\" happens to an item or a buff you (Rioters) are ignoring the issue instead of dealing with the problem. This is, I believe anyways, the mass majority of the anger coming from the community. It just looks like such pure favourtism that it makes people angry.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Proelium","date":"2015-02-23T22:08:31.106+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe this is the right place for this maybe not...\n\nWhy is it all my favorite champions are being moved to jungle roles?\nPantheon, Trundle, Jarvan... etc.\n\nAll used to be some of my favorite top lanes and now I generally have to pick them for Jungle to be ideal and they're even being balanced around the jungle which hurts their lane potential.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Sotere","date":"2015-02-24T08:55:14.908+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"The last set of buffs (way back in 4.7, mind you) we did for J4 were intended to make his top lane better.

You added a mechanic specifically to deal with one strategy that has always had a small niche in the meta. Why would you care if maybe it seemed a bit strong or not? Thats exactly the kind of area you let the players innovate and deal with. Adding an entire mechanic to the map for just that team comp style is far to meddlesome. Especially when that mechanic is clunky and disrupts other areas like dots, karthus ults, running from jungle invade to get free shield, etc.\n\nI once saw a Maoki chasing a near dead jungler out of their jungle. Maoki throws the sappling and shield comes onto fleeing jungler just as sappling hits saving him. The sappling then takes off running after him and the shield comes back on him again just in time to save him from the detonation. Thats how we actually experience these inane turret shields in the game. Randomly disruptive.\n\nI get you wanted more out of the jungle and a big change like that is the sort of area I would expect the game developer to be messing around with. You didnt change the jungle just to deal with split pushers or aoe team comps. It wasnt changed specifically to counter certain strategic approaches. My issue with your approach is that you have been far to slow to adjust it and you refuse to tackle the small group of champions that are not even letting you get a good view of how well tuned the jungle is. Until you do something about those champs you will consistently get a warped view of the jungle as your feedback to work from.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Kowe The Ewok","date":"2015-02-22T16:31:05.749+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":5,"body":"So why is it fine for assassins to have such mobility?\nJust because of their class name?\n\n[Zed has more base health than Rammus, so does Akali.

I'll hit some of them that I have strong opinions about.  \n\n> How do you feel about people saying that towers are too weak? \n\nI can understand why people feel this way: we have a lot of tools available in the game to destroy turrets quickly. Full tanks, which are pretty common, can also sit and tank a lot of turret shots.  However, I'm fairly confident that turrets are just all around stronger than they were before the season swap. So much so that it might have deleterious effects on the game as a whole.  This is actually the most troubling mismatch of perception to power for me in the game at the moment.   \n\n> How do you feel champ diversity relates to the LCS? \n\nThe LCS (and pro play across the world) impacts player perception and thus play rate pretty dramatically.  It is hard to imagine a world where pro play has little diversity but common play does.  This makes it tricky, because pros have a lot of legitimate reasons to not add a ton of variety into their play.  They often use picks to steal away high priority champions from the enemy team.  Teams, imo, also get advantages by practicing with similar squads in repetition, so 'surprise' picks are less valuable.  \n\n>  Are you ok with the same champions being played most of the time? Is that the result of pro players or balance issues?\n\nI definitely want to see more diversity. I think even if we get champion diversity to a state where it's \"okay\" in our view, we'll still see some repetition in picks.  I think balance issues are the primary culprit, though there have been some cases where professional play stubbornly would not adopt certain champions and held onto others too long.  \n\n> Do you really think mobility like Kalista and Yasuo are good for the game?

I think Lee Sin is too strong early game (even if he falls off badly late game). I'm ok with a champion being strong early game (it's part of the champion selection strategy) but Lee in particular is kinda abusive. He can counter jungle decently, his ganks are awkwardly strong, he's basically a low-risk high-reward champion. Same for Vi, but she even maintains more utility late game.\n\n**What would I do to Lee Sin?** Just make W so it can only be casted on ally champions or himself (I know you all love his ward-hopping big plays but they are not fun nor fair to play against, his Q is what he should need to engage, if he fails his Q, then he'll have to wait a bit to try against, instead of just W + R). And I'll also reduce R's damage a bit. Right now it's just a \"press when the enemy is below X health\" execute ability even when it's meant for control. R should be used for his knock-back, not because of his damage, he has a huge kit with high damage to do so. (And again, it's frustrating to fight him and then get executed by that R when you have 400 HP).\n\n**What would I do to Vi?** Early game Vi excels at every single aspect of this game: she clears well, she counter-jungles well, she's a monster ganking, she escapes fairly well, and she has too much knock-ups. You should just remove damage from his Q (it has still a powerful knock-back and and gives her insane mobility, it is just unfair that it also deals 300 +1.6 AD at max rank). Right now Vi max her Q because no matter what you need (mobility, CC, damage) it's the best ability to do so. Maybe you could just move damage to her E so people will have to think twice when maxing E for damage or Q for mobility/knock-back. And please take away range from her R, iirc now it has ~650, that's too abusive considering that she has already a gap-closer. Maybe making it 375 range would make it fair (especially early game, when her ganks are just Q + R and offer no counterplay for that).\n\n**What would I do to other junglers?** Just check them individually. Some champions like *Hecarim* don't clear it properly (when I say this I mean that they lose too much health in the jungle or they are too slow, I'm not saying they can't jungle). With *Hecarim* you can just remove the damage reduction to monsters from his Q (I think it was there because Hecarim used to clear too fast the old jungle, but the new jungle is twice as tough). Maybe Eve could get a minor buff (because she's really trash-tier at clearing the jungle early game). Finally, tanky junglers should lose less health when clearing the jungle than fighty-assassiny (eh, you said \"mage-y\" in the patch notes) to compensate the fact that their ganks aren't as powerful. It is easy: You can have really good ganks or really good jungle sustain, but not both.\n\n> Mobility is fun and useful or we wouldnt't keep adding it to kits. \n\nI have to completely disagree on this one. Mobility is fun when you are playing a mobility based champion. Lee Sin, Zed or LeBlanc wouldn't be fun if they were immobile, but mobility isn't fun when someone whose strength is not mobility has it. Ahri's R is fun, Ahri's free mobility on her Q isn't: it's just an unnecessary get-out-of-jail that only frustrates the opponent (I played Karthus vs. Ahri two days ago in a ranked, I was really frustrating that she could dodge my Q by just casting hers). I'm ok if you release a champion with mobility and he pays off for it (as a side note, Kassa is already balanced...), but I'm not ok with champions getting mobility for free. Please, stop giving movement speed boosts or short dashes to everyone.\nYou know what is the best solution for Anivia to be viable again? To give her a movement speed boost. And, as an Anivia main, I don't want that to happen. I want a league where my Anivia with her current kit can compete. Even Froggen gave up playing Anivia throughout season 4/5 (I'm glad he picked her once recently though).\n**AND THE MOST IMPORTANT ONE: Make dashes be unable to go through walls. It is just awkwardly unfair for champions that can't go through walls**\n\n**Conclusion:** Mobility is fun when you play champions based around mobility. Mobility stops being fun when everybody has it for no reason.\n\nbtw I'm sorry I wrote a long post. I hope you read it. I also wrote a post some days ago in EUW [talking about what I consider are the problems with mobility mechanic in general.](http://boards.euw.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/champions-gameplay-en/9mK0EQMP-another-post-about-mobility)","replies":[{"poster":"Caeler","date":"2015-02-22T21:58:15.920+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Let's start with Lee Sin.

Basically, his combo is about as good as Pantheon and Wukong's while being faster and safer to pull off. Also add to that all the utility he brings to a team.\n\n>And please take away range from her R, iirc now it has ~650, that's too abusive considering that she has already a gap-closer. Maybe making it 375 range would make it fair (especially early game, when her ganks are just Q + R and offer no counterplay for that).\n\nThe wiki says her ult has a range of 800. This makes it *really* easy for her to get to her target. Most people think that if Vi manages to ult you when you're playing adc it means you were out of position or something but the range on her ult is ridiculous. Add that to her Q, and she can get to you from farther away than a max range Xerath Q. On top of that you can't stop her ult or get away from it.\n\n>What would I do to other junglers? Just check them individually.\n\nI agree but it's likely a lot of other junglers will see play again once the more oppressive early-game ones get their nerfs. \n\n> Some champions like Hecarim don't clear it properly (when I say this I mean that they lose too much health in the jungle or they are too slow, I'm not saying they can't jungle)\n\nI don't think Hecarim is a good example here. Hecarim actually has pretty fast clear due to all of his AOE. He also doesn't really lose that much health because of his W. Compare him to, say, jungle Wukong, who basically hasn't been seen since the new jungle was introduced.\n\n>Maybe Eve could get a minor buff (because she's really trash-tier at clearing the jungle early game).\n\nRiot is currently working on counterplay for stealth junglers, which will make them generally healthier while also allowing for potential buffs.\n\n>Finally, tanky junglers should lose less health when clearing the jungle than fighty-assassiny (eh, you said \"mage-y\" in the patch notes) to compensate the fact that their ganks aren't as powerful. \n\nI second this.

The problem is that too often it comes for free just to give a champ a little extra pizzazz. Roles that need a lot of mobility, like assassins, aren't a huge problem, but roles that already bring a lot to the table, especially mages and ADCs, can be. Even with these it doesn't need to be an ironclad rule that they can't dash, but they do need to pay for it elsewhere in their power budget. For these champs, we are less likely to nerf their movement mechanic and more likely to reduce their damage, survivability or control to pay for the mechanic.\n\nI have to respectfully disagree with this blanket statement that \"mobility is fun\".\nMobility can be fun, both to play as and against, if it is well-designed and fits into the champion's kit.  In order for mobility to be fun to play against, it needs to be something that the opposing player can play around to gain an advantage.\n\nA perfect example of what I would consider \"fun mobility\" is Katarina's Shunpo.  She can use it either to initiate, to dodge a spell, or to escape - however, once it's on cooldown, she has a window where she is very vulnerable to counterattack.  In addition, she can choose to spend her skill points on upgrading Shunpo to reduce its cooldown, making her safer, but she pays the cost of greatly reduced damage output if she chooses to max it early.\nMost champions with mobility have this kind of counterplay - a single ability that they often need to use to initiate their combos, and which leaves them vulnerable while it's on cooldown.  The cost of this mobility isn't just in the power budget taken out of other areas of the kit, but using the ability itself has a cost of putting the champion at risk afterwards.\n\nOne of the reasons so many people hate Lee Sin, Yasuo, Kalista, and to a lesser extent Zed and Kassadin is because they have mobility without this kind of usage risk.  If Lee Sin jumps in with his Q, he can still dash out with his W, or kick someone away with his R.  Kalista and Yasuo can hop and dash around repeatedly, making them almost immune to skillshots if they use this decently (Yasuo even more so, with his shield and wall).  This is where mobility has gone too far, where no amount of nerfs in other areas can really make up for their mobility.  The mobility is what makes these champions' kit feel broken.  You can balance them by nerfing their numbers until they are poor at everything except for that mobility, but that won't make a good or fun champion - it will just make them feel gutted and unsatisfying to play.  When too much of a champion's power budget is (or should be) tied up in their mobility, then the rest of their kit has to be bad to compensate.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dfenestrator","date":"2015-02-22T17:54:22.135+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Ghostcrawler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=2TavB1Ax,comment-id=0016,timestamp=2015-02-22T16:15:05.754+0000)\n>\n> Mobility is fun and useful or we wouldnt't keep adding it to kits.

I also feel like mobile champions generally have very little counterplay if you are playing an immobile champion; it feels like you don't really have many tools to outplay your opponent and instead are hoping your opponent messes up.\n\nRegardless of whether or not your data suggests these feelings are true, do you have any plans to increase mobility's power budget across the board? If so, can we expect to see these changes relatively soon? Or Soon(tm)? \n\nAlso, do you plan on giving immobile champions more tools to deal with mobile champions so they can have active counterplay against their opponents? Or are you content with them only having more passive forms of counterplay and waiting for the enemy to outplay themselves?","replies":[]},{"poster":"GloriousKaiser","date":"2015-02-22T22:01:15.896+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Ghostcrawler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=2TavB1Ax,comment-id=0016,timestamp=2015-02-22T16:15:05.754+0000)\n>\n> We want more champ diversity. A lot of the preseason changes were made with the goal of having games play out differently. Overall we are happy with the changes made to towers, objectives and the jungle, but it hasn't yet created the space for more champs. (I should add at least within one region - if you look world-wide, diversity is preety good, but that's largely because different champs are getting played in different parts of the world.) We knew the changes would be disruptive, meaning it might take players a few patches to explore the best strategies to use in the new environment, but things are starting to settle in now and diversity isn't where we want it to be.\n> \n\nBut what have you really **added** with these changes? Diversity comes from taking away from the strong and possibly giving to the weak. This is mainly how you try to accomplish your goal. But simply taking away from what's already been in place is breaking the diversity. You didn't add diversity by nerfing the potions you could start with. You didn't add diversity by nerfing J4s armor by about 7. You didn't add diversity by nerfing Warriors. \n\nYou need to add diversity. You need to cultivate it. Not cut off the weeds that choke the grass underneath, they'll just grow back again.\n\n> Strategic diversity refers both to champs and to the game itself. If every game is won with a similar comp (even if the champs are different) or every games be becomes a 5 dragon stack, then the risk still exists that the third game you play feels exactly like the previous two. On the topic of champ diversity specifically, it's not a reasonable expectation or a goal to have every champ played equally. Champs have different play styles and themes and that all factors in. But we can do better than we do today.\n\nThat similarity has been with us since Season One. 1/1/2+J is the primary way to go. I don't believe you have succeeded in adding any sort of diversity (let alone diversity at all). The diversity you speak of **REQUIRES NICHES** *Specialists.* If you won't buff those strengths, then how do expect Hecarim => a Quintessential \"hyper clearer, with tons of mobility\" to succeed over Lee Sin?\n \n> Mobility is fun and useful or we wouldn't keep adding it to kits.

To me, it sounds like you really want to keep mobility *no matter what*, and you'll gut, nerf, and slash to keep that Mobility on there. Champions that shouldn't have mobility have it.

So sure, Zed is fun to play into Ahri or vice versa. But you can't play an immobile mage into them without being frustrated. Really I think you need to reevaluate the idea of \"fun\" and \"toxic\" you are using. Otherwise you are going to fall into the same trap as you have been the past year. Where only a small amount of champions are \"fun\" because they are not so weak vs mobility.\n\n\n>**The problem is that too often it comes for free just to give a champ a little extra pizzazz. **\n\nThis is the issue. Champions with high mobility are NOT paying for it in other ways. Can you tell me where the \"trade off\" is on these champions? Nidalee, Kalista, Lee Sin, Gnar, Reksai, Leblanc, just off the top of my head. What is the trade off they give for their high mobility? 5 of the 6 have super high utility. Not to mention they all do high amounts of damage with their kit even if not built assassin (ignoring Kalista seeing as she is an adc).\nSo I think you can understand where players get confused (and upset) when they see Nid/Lee/Gnar/Reksai being strong generalists with high mobility. A generalist should not have a HIGH amount of anything.\n\n\nLooking at the champs you have green lit in the past year, it seems you need to raise the cost of mobility on champions.

They have a list of champions they explicitly don't support for competitive play.  You know, Urgot, Poppy, Yorick, that sort of thing.\n\nI think their ideal champion balance is one in which there is a clear niche for every champion -- you pick Kog to artillery people, you pick Vayne to shred tanks, you pick MF to AoE wombo combo, and so on.  I think they also recognize they are light years away from achieving that goal.\n\n> And if so, what is that strategic diversity, if not champion variety?\n\nI thought they were pretty clear about this.  They want to support a variety of strategies to win the game and playstyles in each role.  For example, they want you to be able to choose a jungler that farms for late game, or a jungler that pressures lanes, or a jungler who tries to live in the enemy jungle.  At the team level, they want to support poke comps, engage comps, aoe comps, pick comps, split pushers, and so on.  Strategic diversity means they don't want any one strategy to become dominant; it remains to be seen whether they will be successful at this.\n\nI don't know that they will ever get to a spot where a wide range of champions are commonly picked.  There's too much overlap in their designs.  For example, it's pretty clear that Lucian and Graves will never be equally strong, and they are so similar that one will always be picked over the other.\n\n> How exactly do you plan on dealing with mobility creep? Do you even think it's still a problem, or should we just expect every low-mobility character to eventually be reworked to keep up?\n\nI don't believe they have said that mobility creep is a problem.  They recognize it's happening, but I haven't heard them say that they want to lower the amount of mobility in the game.  I think they want to revisit champs that seem to not be paying enough value for their mobility {{champion:38}}, and they also want to take a look at the immobile champions that aren't seeming to get enough value in exchange for being immobile {{champion:110}}.","replies":[]}]}
