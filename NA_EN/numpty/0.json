It was fairly recently announced that Galio is slotted to be one the Champ Up teams&#039; next project for a full VGU (yay!), and that left me with a question:\r\n\r\nWhat happens with Gatekeeper Galio? Galio is the first modern VGU champion who will have a preexisting Legendary tier skin! Do you believe that we can expect to see upgrades to this skin beyond the visual upgrades that Galio himself will receive? What about the artwork for the skin? \r\n\r\nThank you for your time!","replies":[{"poster":"Reav3","date":"2016-09-23T04:04:33.406+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't worry fam, Gatekeeper Galio will awesome.","replies":[{"poster":"Numpty","date":"2016-09-28T06:47:11.849+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Reav3,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=c50PKhxY,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2016-09-23T04:04:33.406+0000)\n>\n> Don&#x27;t worry fam, Gatekeeper Galio will awesome.\n\nI know I am late responding to you, but I just wanted to say thanks for stopping by and letting me know.

The latter being the most likely to happen and even if they didn't do that, it would result in a lot of Galio skin buyer being very pissed off.\n\nAnd an updated splash art for all skins are a given.","replies":[{"poster":"Sukishoo","date":"2016-09-22T00:38:32.437+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":">Either they decrease the price on the skin or the animation team bring it's visuals back up to current Legendary status.\n\nThey haven't really done either of those before. Old skins stay the price they are at.  Older legendary skins that don't fit the legendary status have had updates during champion reworks but nothing major.  Firefighter Tristana was the only one to really come close, as by current standards she's about 1350 now.","replies":[{"poster":"Decrit","date":"2016-09-23T14:08:38.371+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also to point out that they indeed issued a price change for many skins  and some other skins had their price increased while others got it lowered ( frostbutt irelia for example got her price reduced). This did not apply to legendaries because they are \"price-protected\" or something like that, if i remember correctly.\n\nthere is to be said that another scenario where price gets changed is nothing to be expected, since that was a special case in a moment where the skins team had to set up some pricing standards and procedures.","replies":[{"poster":"Sukishoo","date":"2016-09-23T15:48:11.778+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That was back when they were adjusting the pricing and tiers, so they're done with that as it was long ago (2013).\n\nhttp://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=3328361\n\nPrices are also subject to change on the PBE though but it's been pretty rare that they actually do there.\n\n\nSo overall an existing skin in the game will not change prices these days unless it was released at the wrong price i.e Sir Kled being put in at 1350 when it was a 975.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Whyte Lyon","date":"2016-09-22T01:07:38.895+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So efforts of the past reflect actions of the future?\n\nI still stand by what I said but at the very least the update team **should** bring Gatekeeper up to some kind of respectable standard. If not then I guess it's tough shit for us. Perhaps then the possibility of Gatekeeper being vaulted might be more likely to happen.","replies":[{"poster":"Sukishoo","date":"2016-09-22T01:14:52.197+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Most of the Old legendary skins are over priced and even with champions receiving updates haven't improved those skins sadly, but that's just the way it is.  Most current ones do come with all new animations and visuals, where as older ones didn't always have that. The original ones seen with Annie, Heimer, Corki, Trist... those ones are way over priced for just a model change but was what it was back in the time they were made where a new model warranted that price.  Riot has said on that note that they won't change the prices sadly.\n\nFor Galio though, he's got some things I'm sure they will improve on with his update.. it may not be 100% legendary quality by the end but it will be a lot better I'm sure.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Moonboy65","date":"2016-09-22T02:28:10.982+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yes Gatekeeper Galio will get a new splash art","replies":[]}]}
