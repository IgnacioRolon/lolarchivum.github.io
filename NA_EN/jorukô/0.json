I LOVE Bruiser type champions who can snowball their lane or engage in a team fight. But at the same time, I enjoy late game Champions who can just AFK Farming and pop up late game. Some games I help my team by T.Ping from top, ganking when jungling or roaming when playing mid. and other times i just AFK farming and never leave my lane. An other problem is that i almost only play AD type champions and i HATE playing pure tanks like Sejuani or Malphite because I personally think that they are so boring to play. That&#039;s why I&#039;m so hard to please when talking about being a One Trick. I know it seems kind of worthless, but I Would really appreciate if anybody could help me on that one.","replies":[{"poster":"Snowman Arc","date":"2017-02-03T09:02:38.821+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maokai is just perfect. The more I play him, the more I realize the mistake I'm doing trying to play these fighters like Irelia to try and climb. Maokai:\n-is tanky as fuck. He doesn't only build tanky, but he has tankiness in his kit. Passive gives him a lot of healing, especially in teamfights. Ulti reduces damage taken by 20%. W makes him untargettable.\n-has endless CC and teamfighting presence. 40% CDR means his W is on about 5 seconds CD (2 second root), and his Q is on 3.6 seconds, while also having a strong slow on his E. He can also be used as a peeler rather than an initiator-backline thing, and protect his team with his ulti.\n-has a lot of damage. And people just don't realize this. His damage is insane for a initiaing tanky character. Base damages (and scalings) are high, but also Sunfire Cape, Iceborn Gauntlet and maybe Thornmail add a lot more.\n-is easy to play, generally. Activate R, click with W, Q once you're on top, E wherever. Just make sure you AA as much as possible (like W in, AA, Q, AA, E, AA) so that you get the most damage, maybe Sheen procs, but also passive healing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mysticman89","date":"2017-02-02T22:48:43.293+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I actually got urgot as a possibility reading through that. AD but not pure tank yet kinda sorta tank-ish who can engage fights with his ult and also can get somewhat oppressive with his lock on missles once ahead.\n\nThe thing with one-tricks is you can completely ignore whether someone is meta or not (and over the course of one tricking them, they almost certainly won't be), and once you've got enough games on them you'll know how to handle pretty much every match up.\n\n(That said, you don't need to go all the way to one-trick status. It's pretty reasonable to play just a handful of champs and switch around based on mood and match up, so you could do things like nasus when you're in a afk farm mood, and kled if you're feeling ham engages.)","replies":[]},{"poster":"reaperteaser","date":"2017-02-02T22:18:04.065+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"maokai can play all three roles required, team fight potential stays relevant far into late game, can be built full ap bruiser or full tank, can even do well as a support in case of autofills\n\nif you can get past the ap part of him then hes perfect, otherwise i would say camile, but shes almost perma-banned","replies":[]},{"poster":"IA9hRfpP5q","date":"2017-02-02T21:30:37.591+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:92}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lancerblader","date":"2017-02-02T21:29:28.738+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i cant think of anything specific to recommend but i personally find playing something unusual or isnt picked tooo often is the most fun. atm for me that is warwick top.\nits also very nice since it tends to mean your pick will almost never get banned","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cocho","date":"2017-02-02T21:11:33.149+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Reading this all I could think of was {{champion:92}}  lol\n\nShe is by far the best champ to one trick.\n{{champion:114}} can't really engage like Riven, but she scales super hard.

Not sure how his late game is though.\n\nRiven is amazing if you're fine with not being able to engage well without Flash. She likes roaming mid, though, else if you wanna stay top then you gotta build according to your target, which may not be as great in teamfights. If you don't build tank shred/lifesteal against tanks, you'll be forced out of lane, and tank shred/lifesteal is generally less useful in teamfights (depending on playstyle, tho), so you won't be as great late game.\n\nShe's very difficult, of course.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SpearKitty","date":"2017-02-02T20:49:53.983+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First of all, I agree with the above people that Gangplank sounds like a champ you might enjoy a lot. Second of all, you don't just _choose_ to onetrick. If you try to force yourself to onetrick just because you want elo or whatever then you'll get really bored and tired of the game and eventually just completely lose interest in it. \"You don't choose your onetrick champion; your onetrick champion chooses you.\" is probably the best way I could put it. At one point I had a new \"main\" champion every other week because I just got tired of the champs I was playing so quickly as I tried to just main them or spam them. But in my Snowdown shop at the end of season 5 I got a Nidalee skin. I tried her and she was just so far and beyond every other champ I had ever played in terms of how fun she was to play, and because of that I kind of fell in love with playing her. I don't mind playing other champions every now and then, but I choose to try to stick only to Nid because she just feels _right_ when I play her.\n\nTl;dr GP is the pirate for yer booty, you don't choose to onetrick. {{champion:76}}","replies":[{"poster":"Joruk么","date":"2017-02-02T21:04:28.256+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What you said is truely inspiring and i just realized that I would mostly prefer to have a short champion pool instead of being a One Trick like Vertigal who plays only Ahri even if he has to play her jungle or adc.
