Like how I wrote.\n\nNo. At the end of alpha strike Yi appears next to the champion. But what is happening is that at the time that Yi is suppose to appear Jarvan is in the wall. A champion (Yi ) can't appear inside a wall. So the game calculates _at the exact moment Yi is suppose to reappear_ where the closest allowable spot to place Yi is. That may be the near side (where J4 started his pull from) so that is where the game plops Yi's model. Meanwhile J4 continues the pull and goes to the other side. The game doesn't prolong the alpha strike if Yi is being placed in an inconvenient spot relative to the target. It places Yi as close to the target as it possibly can the moment Yi is suppose to leave alpha strike. \n\n_I didn't say that it did.
