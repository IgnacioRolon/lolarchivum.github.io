As a tali main I&#039;m still rocking mid (pun intended) but after minutes of gameplay she runs out of mana pretty quickly after using her E W combo and her Q doesn&#039;t even deal that much to Melee minions so what gives riot? Taliyah is pretty hard to play considering how hard it is to land your W and you have to predict most of the time. \r\n\r\nDon&#039;t you want people to play taliyah? she really underrated but can be a beast in lane when you use her kit properly.","replies":[{"poster":"Cocho","date":"2017-08-09T08:48:44.783+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"She one of the best midlaners in high elo.
