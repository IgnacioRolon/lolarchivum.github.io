Will it be streaming on lolesports?  Will the bracket be updated?  Will the matches be posted on youtube? \r\nThanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Poro Support","date":"2014-11-12T20:04:19.598+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">Both the NA and EU tournaments will feature two rounds of online competition, followed by an additional three rounds of competition which will be broadcast live from ESL’s studios in Burbank for the NA Expansion games and in Cologne for the EU Expansion games.\n\nThat was in the link you provided. I'd imagine it'll be updated and streamed from the normal two/three methods of streaming and then hosted later on YouTube.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PwnLove","date":"2014-11-13T23:59:38.610+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"You'll be able to watch the Expansion Tournament over on Lolesports starting on Nov 15.

The NA Expansion Tournament broadcast will begin at 11 AM PST each day. \n\n(quote from http://euw.lolesports.com/articles/welcome-2015-spring-expansion-tournament)\n\nThis however is not working for me at all, nor is the twitch stream from Esltv running currently (just came home from work)...making me kinda curious why it´s hosted on ESLtv anyway instead of using the Riotchannels. \nHistory has shown that you´re quite competent hosting these streams, i don´t see why you suddenly should switch channels just to have this kind of mess.","replies":[{"poster":"KzooCrasher","date":"2014-11-17T00:45:37.502+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Idk it has really sucked. I saw the IEM qualifiers on els tv and they were horribly produced and most the vods i couldn't even find. The vods from yesterdays expansion tournament still aren't up who knows when todays will be (because i missed them)There is a youtube channel epic skill shot that I have to go to to watch the vods because they aren't being put up on the Lolesports site like they use to be. Its pretty sad that I have to go to unofficial vods from third parties because Riot isn't handling the streams for their own lcs now","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Mediocre Joe","date":"2014-11-14T15:29:36.898+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> You'll be able to watch the Expansion Tournament over on Lolesports starting on Nov 15.
