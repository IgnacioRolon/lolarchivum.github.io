Is that normal since I'm basically receiving a $25 skin for free? If so, then how would I be able to get the icon now if I can no longer purchase him since I unlocked him?

I looked into this for you and see that you already received!  The icons aren't in order though, so you may need to scroll down your list a bit to find it.
