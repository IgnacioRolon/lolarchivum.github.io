I&rsquo;m just not sure why they felt it was necessary to remove it? Like I GET his lore changed, and I understand that it&rsquo;s not ~cool~ to have a cane, but I cried tears of happiness when I first found out Swain used a cane, and just don&rsquo;t understand why they couldn&rsquo;t have left it in.

A lot of your reworked/mashed up champions were _supposed_ to be similar to each other. Darius and Garen are both rivals and juggernauts (and S2 and younger). Jhin and Caitlyn both play the sniper archetype and Caitlyn and Jinx are supposed to be rivals. Xin Zhao and Wukong are both Divers and honestly you'd have had a better comparison between Camille or Malphite respectively, unless you mean the entire Diver subclass feels similar in which case you're not wrong but still stretching. And Kha'Zix and Rengar have an entire in-game event I mean.\n\nNow I'm trying to parse the point of your posts. If you're not trying to make an argument, are you trying to be a captain obvious here? All champions, not just the ones you pointed out, borrow from folklore and archetypes and knockoffs, and most of your reworked/mashed up comparisons are intentionally designed to be so.
