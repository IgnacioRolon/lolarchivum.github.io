But I got only A. Here are the stats :\r\nhttp://www.1mage.fr/images/stats1.png\r\nI won't show every stats, but I got a large lead over anyone else in the game both in damages dealt to champions and to objectives, I participated to our four drakes, our Nashor and most of our towers. Ok, my minions score is just ok, but except from that it's en exemplary game !\r\nThree of my teammates had S or even S+, but I got only A, not even A+ or S-. I don't know how I am supposed to do way better than that !\r\nMorover it appends quite regularly. I already got  an A on a game I full carried and finished 10-0.\r\n\r\nWould be nice to have a clue about what I shall do to get some mastery token.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-04T03:16:30.611+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There aren't any hard stats that you need in order to get an S. The biggest finer point that most tend to miss is that these scores are based off how well you did *compared to other people playing the same champion in the same role*. Players might be using Jhin in that lane while getting a higher vision or creep score.","replies":[{"poster":"Magic Serwyn","date":"2017-09-04T10:58:06.006+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for your answer !\nWell I completely get that's it's compared to other players, but it doesn't change the point. Does that mean that a lot of Jhin players get similar or better kda/damages and better vision and cs ? Is there such an heavy biais for vision and creep score compared to kda, damage dealt and objectives participation ?","replies":[{"poster":"Hello I am Bird","date":"2017-09-04T21:06:35.202+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In general, the biggest thing is creep (from my experience)\nObviously, you should make sure your KDA is not negative, but having at least 2 more kills and assists than deaths + a healthy amount of creep + (generally) not letting your ward count stay at two for too long are the three surefire ways to get an S~~(-)~~","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Utahraptor","date":"2017-09-04T00:59:40.273+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My brother got an S- going 5-0-5 with around 150 cs and participation in a majority of things. The team surrendered at 17:00 so that is one example. Note: This is in blind pick. My friend (who also mains Jhin) got an S- by going 30-15-9. Note: This was Ascension and I have no idea how this happened with literally no minions. I think the goal is to have the best score early game and force the enemy team to surrender early, or have a huge amount of kills late game with as many deaths as you'd like. (I'm thinking a 2:1 ratio is pretty good though.) My friend also went 10-0-6 with a 25-minute surrender, good participation and cs and such-forth but only got an A+. Note: This was draft pick. (If you are wondering, yes he was pissed.) I guess Jhin is just kinda weird.  \nI'm Utahraptor13 and I don't entirely know what cs is. Correct me plz. :)","replies":[]}]}
