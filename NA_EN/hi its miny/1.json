Game starts loading and BAM bugsplat. Of course I keep reloading and I keep getting bugsplat. Now I'm in a queue and lost my promos, and obviously I have no control over it. Third time this has happened and second time this has happened during one of my promos. So, since someone from RIOT will most likely just say, \" Go look at one of our guides to avoid a bugsplat,\" I've decided to just quit. I  I sincerely do hope you fix this problem (most likely won't though its RIOT lul). **_Peace for now and forever!_**","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-15T02:16:50.584+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, I know it doesn't feel good to lose a promo, especially when you aren't even able to load into the match due to a technical issue. :/\n\nIf you're up for it, I'd be more than willing to assist you in troubleshooting this. Yes, we do link to guides quite a lot, but that's because tons of hours have been spent to cultivate those guides into all-in-one solutions for a lot of the common technical issues we see happen in League. The first thing I'd have you check is if the Windows Game Bar is enabled. This feature has caused a ton of issues for some players in League, including bugsplats, low FPS or PC crashes. [**This guide**](http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8637-game-bar-turn-off-windows-10-a.html) will walk you through disabling the feature so we can see if this was the culprit. I'd strongly recommend testing any changes during the troubleshooting process inside a custom match so there isn't a risk of a Leaverbuster penalty in the event the issue wasn't resolved.\n\nPlease let me know if you continue to experience this issue after taking those steps so we can continue to troubleshoot this together.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SaVaGeStaNo","date":"2016-12-15T03:03:26.476+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"It sucks you would even release a half assed , half done client. Then we play ranked in it , while your experiencing tons of bugs + not easy to read visual/ audio cues for champ select. this paired with autofilling + tons of dodges/remakes.. Makes the game pretty bad experience lately. Cant say i havent felt like the OP ... I am until you disable it, using the legacy client only. Its not worth risking a horrible experience on the new one, for nothing new feature wise. Animations, new graphics, etc isnt what we need. The old cleint would of been perfect if you could of stopped crashes in champ select. I like the new client but the always on friends list thing, kind of tilts me as im mainly a solo player.  This along with the failing animations/queue visual indicators/ foreground-background issues the game can be tilting.","replies":[]}]}
