As title says, I feel like honor is progressing a lot slower this season. I&#039;d say around 50 or 60% of my games I get honored but am still honor level 2. Last year I got it in around a month or two, and pretty much once every two weeks I&#039;d go up an honor level. Anyone else noticing this change? Or maybe I&#039;m just crazy xD.","replies":[]}
