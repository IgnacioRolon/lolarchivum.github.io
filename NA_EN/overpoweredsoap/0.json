You can tell they're much happier/more vibrant when in lanes together and when they're with other supports they have entirely different dialogue like they're bored and don't want to be there and seem overly annoyed. \n\nFrom a story + personality perspective this makes sense because people are drastically more different when solo/with strangers than they are with people they're strongly attached to.

Most of their things are affected by their relationship, their love.

(I must remind you, this argument was only shown in LGBT threads.)\n\nI don't see them.\n\nMy complain is, If you are actually homophobic but don't want to look like one, stop it and be yourself.
