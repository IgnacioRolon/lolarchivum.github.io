Friend1 opened this link and he now cant log into his account. Friend2 can but the hackers have access to his account (that account is sending links to loads of people and he isn't doing it). So mm and friend2 decided to try reset his password to prevent their access. The last step is to fill in the pass code it sent to your email. Sadly the hacker changed that account's email. This is all i have of that email \"*******RBAA147@GMAIL.COM\".  \r\n\r\nBack to friend1. I spoke to the hacker, 1st trying to bait the link (i didn't have it at the time). He replied but he/she didn't seem to be English as it wasn't understandable. I eventually said i knew he is a hacker and so he blocked me. Friend1 can not log into his account at all.\r\n\r\nI went onto the hacker's site and i checked the site's code. It uses another website called \"hitwebcounter.com\". I'm not sure how it works but i think it looks on your computer for your account details somehow. \r\n\r\nSorry if i shouldn't have started a discussion. I'm new to the LoL forums and I'm panicking a bit. I just wanted to post this as soon as possible. There are more than those 2 people who have been hacked, the links seemed to have gotten everywhere (besides me for some reason). I am very sad and so are my friends at the lose of the accounts {{item:3070}}. I hope this is posted under the right board (like i said im new to the forums). Sorry for any inconvenient if any is caused!\r\n\r\nAny help or advice would be appreciated a TON.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-17T21:45:48.642+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This can definitely be fixed, no worries just yet!
