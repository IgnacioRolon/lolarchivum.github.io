I feel like this requirement is a little steep considering a couple of bad games can compromise your end of season rewards.\r\n\r\nIf there is such a requirement for obtaining rewards, maybe during the end of season Riot should make &quot;events&quot; that makes it easier to gain honor for those who did screw up. Let&#039;s be real for most people it is taking around 2 months to get to honor 2 from scratch. Here are some ideas that I could come up with.\r\n\r\n-Making it easier to reach checkpoints (at least for the final stretch)\r\n-No penalty on receiving honor from friends \r\n-Playing with new players grants extra honor \r\n-Making it so that you can honor more than 1 player per game (a lot of times more than 1 person played really well and deserves it)\r\n-If you achieve honor 2 within a timeframe (lets say 2 months after season officially ends) then you will be able to open a ticket and request for the rewards\r\n\r\nLet me know thoughts + comments, I am sure I am not the only one in this situation.","replies":[]}
