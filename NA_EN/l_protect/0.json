When first started, which was a couple of months ago, each game would take around half a gig. Now when he plays it's taking over an entire gig. I checked his computer to see if he had any background programs running but everything seemed fine. I looked on the forums and I found that people were playing games while using data nowhere near close to the data that's been used by him (other people were playing games with 40-100 mb of data usage on each game).\r\n\r\nHe plays on a laptop (if that helps get any clues). Any suggestions on what to do?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-19T21:52:01.582+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"League should typically take anywhere between 50-100MB per match, depending on game mode, length of the match and the number of actions taken in the match. I recommend your friend 100% ensure no background apps are consuming data by [performing a clean boot](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting#wq3) before hopping into a match to test usage.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2016-10-19T23:01:12.750+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Just to elaborate a bit, maybe the problems are background apps **on the phone**, not on the laptop?","replies":[]}]}
