It is also worth noting that champions were simpler then, with few of them adding new mechanics, effects, or technology to the game, so developing a kit was done in terms of what was already possible, not what would be cool to realize or expand on (Zoe has at least 2 new mechanics - sleep and walls adding length to skillshots.  Not sure if re-casting pladdlestar counts)\n\nSo yes, Riot has shown that, in the past (with an arguably lower production value - fewer VO lines, very few new things, etc) a team can churn out a champion much faster than currently.  I think it still took a team more than a few months to make a champ though.","replies":[{"poster":"Glory ln Death","date":"2017-12-21T01:10:39.149+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"The reason they were able to pump out champions that fast is because they were basically doing things at the speed the other guy was talking about.

Lots of basic dashes, empowered auto attacks, etc.\n\nNowadays, they take a lot more time in order to make champions more unique and cohesive all around.

At this point it's all production (modeling, animating, sound design, etc.), and none of that takes several months to do. The only thing that could potentially take a long time is getting a VA in, since they can be pretty booked at times -- and then hiring a VA for other language regions too.\n\nLeague is a very, very small game, and the models aren't really super high quality or anatomically correct (they're made in perspective, and in the cartoony, stylized thing League does), so animating and programming isn't going to be some monumental undertaking. And Riot has hundreds of people working full-time jobs with a multi-billion dollar profit. So if some little company like Square Enix can pump out new content in FFXIV every 3 months, and if Arena Net can constantly update Guild Wars 2, then I see no reason why League can't rework cancerous old champs in a month or two per -- well, actually, the reason is to build up hype so more people spend money, but hey.","replies":[{"poster":"KenBates","date":"2017-12-21T05:42:03.650+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"League is a very, very small game\"\nshould i say more","replies":[{"poster":"KenBates","date":"2017-12-21T05:44:20.051+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"you know what, just in case\nhttps://www.unrankedsmurfs.com/blog/players-2017","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Boobspawn","date":"2017-12-21T03:19:54.985+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are so many champions that were teased then COMPLETELY REWORKED into other things.
