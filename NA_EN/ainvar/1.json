Winning a lane is really close to winning a game right now, and soloQ junglers are not as good as professionals. I wouldn't call it banking on a bad jungler, i call it knowing the environment you are playing and knowing your own abilities. Your chances at climbing in a low elo are better if you don't rely on your team map awareness. You win the lane, win the game, grab your LP and start another. Vision becomes more important as the time goes on, to control crucial point of river, but investing into lane advantage early on is a better strategy.
