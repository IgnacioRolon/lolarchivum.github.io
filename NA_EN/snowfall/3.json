I've said this before, and I'll say it again.  Yasuo has the Holy Trinity of Damage, CC, and Mobility.  Sure, he's item dependant, but he snowballs REALLY hard, and he's able to waveclear without any real effort once he gets Shiv, so it's really damn hard to keep him down, even if he's feeding.  He can take out squishies and tanks (due to his ult) with ease, and there is really nothing you can do, besides CCing him, that will save anyone on your team, yet in close quarters his kit lets him naturally dodge CC if the player using him has any real skill.\n\nIf you want Yasuo buffs, about 1/3 of his kit has to go away.  He cannot be a tank killer and an assassin at the same time, and his x2 crit is the major reason for his repeated nerfs.  How about he gets a normal single passive instead of the double one you're so sure he needs?  That's what most champs have, and they don't usually get banned every time they get buffed.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ZootSuitZombie","date":"2015-01-18T21:31:07.540+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, he does have 2 passives: His Crit passive and his Flow passive.

Im still wondering if the target gets still cc'd, since it'll directly hit the target instead of the wall.\n\nAnd yasuo being weak.. well, he's fairly balanced in my opinion. He does a good amount of damage, has like two shields in his kit, and his shield recharges everytime he ultimates into an enemy. He's squishy for sure, but his passive does absorb a good amount of damage.","replies":[{"poster":"Long Dong Wukong","date":"2015-01-19T02:42:03.173+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It would absorb a single wave of an MF ult, **or** a Nami ult, **or** a single Ahri spell, **or** a single adc auto attack.\n\nKeyword **or**, as opposed to\n\n>Because it will block an entire Miss Fortune ult, a Nami wave, and Ahri combo, **all at the same time**\n\nAlso no, he's weak. His base stats are so just unbelievably atrocious for a melee champion that his weak early game is damn near a \"feeding phase\", to the point that is *late game fantasy* is quite literally a fantasy.\n\nOh, and they just chopped 10% crit off of Yasuo by moving it to Phantom Dancer. PD is not a viable item on Yasuo. Shiv is a must-buy and fills the same role.\n\n>but his passive does absorb a good amount of damage.\n\nThe passive that's been nerfed on like 5 different patches to the point that he almost can't generate it in lane, when he actually needs it?","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"qetzel","date":"2015-01-18T15:24:40.119+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I disagree with one point. You said that \"no champion should be so reliant on other champions' specifics\". I believe that picking a team in this game is more important than picking a champion. If we allow every champion to be picked in every team then we get the Thresh or the (old) Lee SIn case where you only pick the strongest champion.\n\nEvery champion needs a reason to be played. For Yasuo it is his synergy with knockups.","replies":[]}]}
