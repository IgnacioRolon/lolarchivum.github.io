Supports rarely take cs yet they can be the only person the team to get an S+, S, or S-. Also, Riot said that it takes into account your role and the attributes of that role. \n\nThe main thing is NOT to loose your tower because as the \"guardian\" of that lane is too ensure that it stays strong (jg is an exception of course). \nSupports need to ensure their team gets kills and is able to leave safely (sometimes at the cost of their own life).\nADC's need to be able to push lane and decimate the enemy team while not feeding. \nTop (same as ADC, also needs to start team fights if tanky) \nMid (same as other lanes, can start team-fights)\n\nBut, you also have to help with objectives. \n\nTop / Bot help jg with leash. \nDragons / Barons / Rift heralds \nTowers / Inhibitors\nThey take into account farm, items built, kills, deaths, and assists. \n\nBut, they mainly base stuff off of if you played your role correctly and efficiently. Sometimes it takes getting that right team. For me, I have a partner (Leona supp) that decimates bot lane with me (MF adc). Our partnership has already earned us 3 S's in a row (I'm S5 and he / she is unranked doing placements today). \n\nMainly, the more that ***you*** are helping with, the more that you will be higher graded. As for your problem, the ADC's farming ties in with their role. They need to farm, push lanes, build items and so forth. Several factors played into that, not just the farming. Someone can have poor farming but still get an S grade. I have read multiple articles and the authors agree that the top three things are: \n\n1. K/D/A (Kills are weighted less than deaths) \n2. Lane Push (Part of your role) \n3. Teamwork (Umm, this is a team game so...) \n\nBut, if you have read this far thank you.

So performing an average \"good\" score means nothing if the average score for that champion is something ridiculous.\n\nAlso! Alot of the time it means you have to be good at CS'ing. So many ADC's perform really well objectively but don't get a high CS score and therefore do not rate the S.\n\nCS matters. And also it ain't about winning. Winning just usually means you and your allies did better than worse. But if you won via making proper decisions such as possibly tanking something to the death to allow another ally to go on a rampage as long as possible in teamfights then you have less of a chance for an S even if you got assists from those deaths and won the game. If you didn't even get many assists or any from those deaths then you most likely won't even get an S. And by being dead you don't participate in getting the objective afterward which typically means an even lower score.\n\nHowever, if you were to make it your main objective to score S you can not prioritize on victory and instead prioritize on not dying, CS, objectives, kills and assists in that order.\n\nFor example: You just aced the enemy except for a Caitlyn and your team is doing baron but it's only you, your tank jungler and your ADC who is low enough for a free ult kill but so are you. Cait ults, targeting your ADC but your team needs him alive in order to DPS baron since your jg is a tank and the jg is too far away from the ADC.\n\nDo you take the bullet for the increased chance of victory? Or let him eat it so you don't have to take a death and a non-participation in a huge objective (baron) which would result in a possible non-S rank?\n\nSee? There are definitely cases where you can choose S over victory.
