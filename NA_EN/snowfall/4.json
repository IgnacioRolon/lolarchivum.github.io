So it really doesn't have the niche it is supposed to provide.\n\nWith this kind of buff (eg. increasing single-target damage or dealing AoE damage), it becomes so much more relevant because it can be used to help stop a team trying to push your own turrets. This gives it a cool niche compared to other tank items, and helps it stand out more.\n\nOnly problem I see is that the losing team having someone with Ohmwrecker might force the other team to get an Ohmwrecker to get through the opposing team's turret, but as long as Ohmwrecker has a long enough cooldown on a turret it shouldn't be a problem.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kögâ","date":"2015-09-18T19:35:32.288+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I love it.
