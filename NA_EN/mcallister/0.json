It doesn't justify the raging or toxicity in any way, but it can be and often is a 100% accurate reason. You are arguing that Riot isn't why people rage, which isn't a consistent provable point. He never once brought anything about responsibility into this, only that you were wrong about what the cause can be. He is simply saying that your argument that \"saying \"you rage because of X\" is invalid\" is incorrect because causality is not in any way linked to responsibility in this scenario. In you example right here, the driver got pulled over got pulled over for honking his horn (equivalent to getting a chat restriction), however, whether he is justified in honking or not, the *cause*—the slow car in front of him (Riot, Trolls, Feeders, *insert reason to rage here*)—remains 100% true and accurate. I believe people when they say \"I rage because of Riot for X reason\", but that doesn't justify them, and you appear to be confusing two separate arguments (justification vs causality).\n\nEDIT: Additionally, you also forget that people aren't saying they get restrictions and bans and want to blame Riot for them, they know it is because they rage, but that punishment is indirectly caused by Riot in the exact same way that the slow car in front of you indirectly caused you to get pulled over. You are never justified by the fact that something else caused it to happen, but pointing out the issue can help the officer pulling you over to make other corrections that help you not be in the situation to get pulled over in the first place.","replies":[{"poster":"McAllister","date":"2015-02-09T23:22:13.085+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":2,"body":"You're making an important distinction between causation and responsibility.  What I'd like to point out is that, in the OP, I'm explicitly talking about responsibility.  Once a person is thinking in terms of \"I chose to be toxic because X,\" I don't really care what X is, because they understand that they could've chosen differently: I hope they'll choose differently next time.  If someone says \"I'm toxic because of trolls,\" I'm not going to respond with \"trolls aren't a problem, you are,\" I'm going to respond with \"trolls may be a problem, but it's your reaction to them that makes you toxic.\"\n\nTo put it another way, I don't care about the causes of toxicity.  Everyone has the option of not raging, so when they choose to rage, the responsibility is on them.\n\nHe is not saying it justifies anything, that's true.  What I'm worried about is what he's thinking.  If I asked him \"do you feel bad about being toxic,\" would he say \"no, I'm toxic because of trolls\" or would he say \"the trolls are horrible, but yeah, I could've done better not responding to them?\"  If it's the second one, that's fine, momentary lapses of judgement are reasonable *as long as you understand that you had a lapse of judgement.*  If it's the first one, our toxic player is never going to try to change, because they don't believe it's something they can control.","replies":[{"poster":"junglerboy16","date":"2015-02-09T23:39:57.352+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"And this is where I see hope in the boards, when we can have an honest and thoughtful discussion about a generally argument based topic (raging).

I really agree with the idea of \"Lapses of judgement\" when it comes to raging. Generally speaking, I don't rage. That is it. I may get mad at a match, but I almost never verbalize it in the chat box for the sake of not costing us a game or myself a ban. Sometimes though, I slip, and I type that 1 sentence into the chat, and a flame war starts. Usually in about 5 minutes I'm sitting there like \"man, I just screwed up\" and sometimes I catch myself sooner and immediately follow up with, \"sorry, that was rude\" and leave it at that.

They rage at the trolls in the game. Instead of trying to chat ban 5 people that 1 troll caused to rage, punishing that 1 person would cause toxicity to go down much further.

I said well wtf then rito guy (not word for word, but I was thinking it like this lol), you are telling me I am not doing anything wrong but still getting chat restricted, why? He said \"the punishment is adjusting to your account\". I said well, that doesn't make sense since you told me that I wasn't doing anything wrong still. What do you mean? He said, \"the punishment is adjusting to the health of your account. I see that the health of your account is improving\". By this point I was fairly frustrated, obviously, but was still nice about it. I said those two things don't make sense mr rito guy. You are telling me that my health is improving, and my punishment is adjusting to my account health level. Then why is the penalty I just recieved 2x as long? That literally makes no sense at all. He said, \"sorry but we can't go into detail\". Some support. After trying to get Lyte on the boards, he finally answers with \"you told your teammate to 'calm the fuck down' because he was raging at one of your teammates\". Yes.

Whether this would translate to more control over emotions (including rage) or improved play (or both) is beyond me. Mastery over the various aspects of the game should also lessen the burden of focus but on the other hand the focus may just move to other aspects of the game like you see from the pros in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvRiA3aCgPI) concerning where their eyes are looking.","replies":[{"poster":"Mistress Madoka","date":"2015-02-10T17:28:04.093+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would just like to congratulate the two of you for making a point and counterpoint without flipping out! You both are now officially the most Logical and Cool-headed people on the internet!\n\nOn a side note, While I agree humans are, quite frankly, shitty at self control, 4/5 the catalyst for people's rage really **isn't** the company behind the game, or the game's mechanics themselves. I tend to find that a Rager's rage is often caused by a mix of:\n\n1. A Streak of Losses - This really is self-explanatory. What's more stressful than losing 1 match? How about 6? Or 10?\n\n2. Simply not having a good day - This seems to be the most common one. Often If I'm having a bad day I'll actually avoid playing League. Some people, however, will hop on thinking \"Maybe a quick match will help me feel better.\" And that might be true, if they actually won, but as it's been shown before, a Poor disposition/Generally negative feelings bog down one's gameplay and skill. So hopping on to play and blow off some steam from a bad day **COULD** simply make your day worse. and most likely lead to a scenario like #1.\n\n3. Being stuck on \"The Meta\" - I'll admit that when someone Meta-breaks, I'm skeptical. On one hand, \"Cool, they're trying something I've never seen! Maybe this is good!\"\nOn the other hand, there's \"Oh jeez, Syndra Jungle? I'm not really confident that will work.\"\nNow, I'm not referring to seeing someone pick a bad pick and feeding horribly as \"Being stuck on 'The Meta'\". I'm Referring to Raging at someone *Before the match even starts* for choosing a champion not commonly used in the role they've taken, or choosing a different Lane-positioning than the \"standard.\" (Such as Duo-top, solo bot. Or Duo-jungle and solo Lanes [Which worked better before the Rift update])\nI understand the Skepticism, but I feel it's important to Remember to ***Separate your Skepticism from your rage.***\n\n4. Playing Alone - Believe it or not, Soloqueue might actually be **bad** for your in-game performance, and in turn, your mood. When you have a friend playing with you, It's a lot less stressful. When you make a Mistake, you have someone else to re-assure you that you DON'T Suck. And this isn't even BEGINNING to touch on the Communication factor. It's practically a no-brainer that better communication = Better teamwork = Better Gameplay. Commonly, good friends playing together will Either be sitting nearby eachother, Using Skype/Curse/insertvoicechattingsoftware, and it's shown to be reliable. the communication is faster, you can talk with your mouth during combat, but you *can't* type during combat.\nTo sum it all up, Play with Friends.

Given that they are trying to adjust player behavior they will have to deal with the nature of humans. I suspect that Riot would first try to help players do number two as you have suggested. The new player experience could help lessen the burden of the game by providing experience (lessening the cognitive load) or proper framing (another concept from psychology). I would bet that their messages on the loading screen are likely trying to provide framing but were easier to implement.

Spend long enough time with a no-nonsense tribunal, and people will stop losing their shit on everyone the instant anything goes wrong.  It is Riot's job to fix this, not mine.  I'm not the irresponsible parents of these kids, but you're forcing me to babysit them with leaverbuster and you want me to try teach them how to speak to another person when there is no way to communicate with them in the first place.  These things are not my responsibility, and I don't understand anyone thinking that they are.  Could I handle this better?  I'm sure its possible, but I also suffer from mental disabilities, the most important one being severe social anxiety disorder.  If someone attacks me, I generally lose it.  I can't help it most of the time because I have a medical condition, but most people seem to think every time I have a panic attack online that it's my fault, and that's just sad.  A platform was given to these random sociopaths to verbally assault people, and that's what it's being used for more often than not.  But it's my fault, right?  :P","replies":[{"poster":"McAllister","date":"2015-02-10T05:25:21.044+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm sorry to hear about your panic attacks.  Some of the people closest to me have generalized anxiety disorder, and it's so scary to watch, I can't imagine what it's like to live through one.  I hope you've found something you enjoy better for your nights.\n\nDo I think it's your fault?  Let me put it this way.  Let's say you weep uncontrollably every time you watch violence against the animal in a traditional Spanish bullfight.  That's completely reasonable: those are brutal, bloody, generally one-sided affairs, I would never watch one myself.  I don't think there's anything wrong with you for breaking down at the thought of it.  That said, if you go to watch a bullfight, and the 9 people sitting nearest to you in the arena (surely machismo-obsessed sociopaths: they enjoy this spectacle) feel like they've wasted half an hour because your grief is so distracting.  Well, in that case, those sociopaths have the right to be upset, because they committed their time to this activity: and you should consider not going to any more bullfights, because it usually doesn't go well for the bull.\n\n{{champion:12}} {{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"InsaneSamurai","date":"2015-02-10T05:38:03.885+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"That would apply if playing league were the issue, but it isn't, it's the trolls and such.

Take responsibility for your actions.\n\nwhile i do agree that it isnt riot's fault its not your fault for being toxic most of the time too. \nif u rage and toxic over a mistake you yourself can easily make and end up being negative all game then its definitely you at fault\n\nbut what if this happens to you multiple games in a row? like you worked hard to get up to plat 1 then all of a sudden multiple negative players giving up at fb or few early mistakes and before you knew it you dropped back down to gold? you would need to be a saint to not rage. \n\nthere are also people who cuss at insult you over 1 mistake wen they themselves makes multiple mistake yet refuse to admit it. Can you really not be toxic after that? sure its possible to hold it in for 1 or 2 games but multiple times? nope not possible.\n\nand im betting some of you think \"take a break then\" and you assume that someone trolling on another day is absolutely impossible. well guess what it happens for weeks even.\n\nits not riot's fault you are toxic, sometimes it is your fault for being toxic, and sometimes you are toxic because of multiple circumstances and situations that pile up.\n\nreason why people throw the blame on riot is because they are being more strict with dodging games (seriously why the fk does this have a penalty?) and being toxic. yet people who troll are always safe. something even more stupid is wen the troll insults u for your mistake then most if not all of ur teamates blames you too. they insult you then wen you say even one thing back BAM u get 4 verbal abuse or negative attitude reports. if you read all this and you still think you wont rage then you have problems imagining yourself in some1 else's shoes or you are so dam lucky that this never happened to you before. this community is rotten (except for maybe a few) and so is riot for pretty much supporting troll acts.\n\nreally from all the comments here you guys act like controlling yourself for multiple troll games and unreasonable people would never be able to get you pissed off. did you guys all buy your gold+ accounts so u dont know the hard work getting there? really wonder what the fk is going through your heads.\n\nI am not saying being toxic is ok but in some circumstances and situations it is just not possible controlling yourself. And when it comes to it and you get toxic, would you really be fine getting a bunch of reports even though you weren't the first one to be toxic or started anything with your teammates? \nif you are fine with everything and no matter what happens you will not get mad then good luck reaching enlightenment or stop bullshitting yourself.","replies":[{"poster":"MidEvilKnight3k","date":"2015-02-10T08:09:07.030+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is possible to not rage playing league of legends regardless of what happens.

I'm facing something of a dilemma, however. While I take it as a point of pride to vent to MYSELF (that is, I'll growl out while I'm playing but never take it out on my team-mates) I find myself getting a bit discouraged. While we do get little gifts here and there to encourage us to not be toxic and support our team-mates such as the mystery skin (here's hoping mine comes soon) I find myself in a position where even if I play well, an entire game can get thrown by the actions of a single individual. In my last game for example, our Tryndamere went 1/10/1--and had fed five times by the seven minute mark. Even after encouraging him to play cautiously, using smart pings, etc, it didn't make much of a difference.\n\nNow, I didn't flame--I didn't even make a sarcastic comment like \"those throws though\". But I was frustrated, and even though I said \"Good game, well played\" after surrendering, I still felt a bit crushed inside. Being toxic helps nobody--it just vents poison. But maybe my question can be answered best by a more experienced player. That is, how do you constructively deal with a game like that? If it isn't a matter of team composition, or individual skill, how do you deal with a thrown game?\n\nThe only real solution I've found is taking a break, and coming back a bit later. But it seems to be an unfortunate trend that, at least where I am now, it is difficult to eke out a victory if even one person is overly new or unskilled. How do you handle that? I personally always try to support or jungle, but I almost feel a kind of learned helplessness at points.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kazaashi","date":"2015-02-10T15:48:59.877+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think this may help some people out. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tilt_(poker)\n\nRaging at people can cause people to go on Tilt and you being on Tilt can cause you to rage at people.  If you are not going into your Ranked games with a \"Meh, I could lose a game\" attitude, you are setting yourself up for a loss.\n\nAs for AFK's and trolls, there is not really much Riot can do about them.  It is much easier to break and abuse something than to create something.  We as a community need to be better.  We need to let things go, and realize that Normal, Placement, Promo, etc. match its just a game and we shouldn't let it control us.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MrSlowDie","date":"2015-02-10T07:04:33.751+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"I kill him, because he forced me to do that\"\nit's not his fault...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kazaashi","date":"2015-02-09T22:01:46.343+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"Statistically speaking there is more of a chance of a feeder, afk, or troll being on the enemy team.
