In that regard I think she'd be good as a bruiser or a tank. She definitely should not have access to poke or be much of a lane bully though. She's got to be that champ that you dread trading melee with when you go in to CS because she's a beefy lady with a big-ass blacksmiths hammer  and **HER CONVICTIONS WILL NOT FALTER** . Whatever you dish out she will be able to take. To draw a parallel she should come off concept wise as the lady-yordle equivalent of Garen, minus the patriotism and military  position.\r\n\r\n The most important part of the rework for me would be her lore and main concept remaining wholly the same. Like, she was a kid doing an important political job with her dad and her dad was killed by assassins while she had to watch helpless **and** she finished the job for him without asking for a reward when she did. She needs to be the most justicey character that has yet been released. She's not even after revenge on the guys that killed her dad. She's in it for peace and diplomatic unity. After all, Poppys main goal is that **VALORAN WILL KNOW HARMONY**. She's gotta be somber, not sad necessarily, but I don't think that she should really be funny. After all, **SHE DOESNT KNOW ANY JOKES**.\r\n\r\nEither way as long as her story remains mostly the same and her character stays intact I have faith in Rito delivering a bitchin' Poppy.\r\n\r\n{{item:3060}} {{champion:78}} **HER REWORK IS NON-NEGOTIABLE**{{champion:78}} {{item:3060}}","replies":[{"poster":"IronStylus","date":"2014-11-09T04:20:02.862+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":3,"body":">She's got to be that champ that you dread trading melee with when you go in to CS because she's a beefy lady with a big-ass blacksmiths hammer  and **HER CONVICTIONS WILL NOT FALTER** .

But what does that mean and how does it translate into any meaningful theme for Poppy at a high level?\n\nThings I get the feels for when I thin of Poppy:\n\n- Big power, small package. Whether she's the runt of the litter, the outcast, whatever, she's tiny and packs a punch. Contrast, love that shit.\n\n- Conviction and loyalty. Maybe she's part of the home guard, maybe she's her own little one-yordle army. Either way, she has her allegiance and it's like an oath that binds her.\n\n- Serious. Unlike a lot of yordles, Poppy is probably the least goofy or silly. Maybe she's even stoic. Either way she's not a big-brain like Heimer, nor is she a crazed bomber like Ziggs. She's got grit and isn't down with the nonsense.\n\nBig character reference for me, though not in terms of actual scale :P -- http://i.imgur.com/8YbWLA3.jpg?1\n\nLet me know if I'm off the mark with that. \n\nDiplomat though.. \n\nYes, I realize that it's something in the current iteration of her story. But what does that mean at a **high level**? A diplomat is a career, it isn't an identifying characteristic of a person's core. You could be an honest, peace loving diplomat. You could be a sneaky, covert ops \"diplomat\". You could have good, bad or neutral agendas. Either way, this is the least compelling term that currently shows up in the lexicon. I would argue that it's completely arbitrary, and is only compelling on an extremely granular level. Not something I'd build a character off of.\n\nThat said, I'm open to ideas. I'm more interested what players **feel** viscerally when they play or want to play Poppy. What makes her compelling at her core? What makes her speak to the pint-sized terror in all of us? What makes us root for the underdog? What allows us to feel what drives her?","replies":[{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2014-11-09T04:35:10.635+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"The important thing about diplomat-Poppy is that, otherwise, some of her best lines make no sense (Let me demonstrate HAMMER diplomacy!, Their defeat is non-negotiable!)\n\nI don't think of her as an 'underdog' really. That's an obvious first glance based on her appearance, of course, given she's a tanky, bruiser-y monstrosity while also being tiny, but nothing about her story or personality indicates 'underdog' in the least. I wouldn't complain too much if you decided to focus on that aspect of her character (except possibly to grumble about how most Yordles seem to have 'small' as a personality trait), but I don't feel it much from current Poppy.\n\nI find current Poppy to be a dedicated, hard working, and loyal soldier who refuses to back down. I think one of her greatest strengths is the contrast with the rest of the yordles, since all of them are some flavor of crazy and wacky. I think overemphasizing her size or yordle-ness is a mistake; removing that contrast to make her more 'adorable' or 'yordle-like' will just end up making yordles one-note crazies, not an entire civilization, let alone a species of sapient beings.\n\nAlso, I shouldn't have to say this, but more armor. Shiny bling armor is acceptable, but I think it'd be better if most of her armor was well-used and pragmatic; maybe it should have some sort of 'family heirloom' feel to it, since basically every non-Noxian is obsessed with keeping their armor shiny.","replies":[{"poster":"IronStylus","date":"2014-11-09T04:39:09.906+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":2,"body":"Warning: 100% chance of her VO changing.

Narrative has not demanded that Summoner's Rift be stripped down to an abstract color-plane or a Tron-esque grid; in their great mercy, they have seen fit to allow us an implicit visual plot for our petty little game. Why, then, is it so crucial to excise references to Summoners from the voicework? Why is it important that Champions mumble to themselves like lunatics instead of engaging with the Summoners who are backing them up on the Field (us)?\n\n(And I swear, IronStylus, I like you a lot, but if you go repeating that insulting line about \"Summoners are creepy evil puppetmasters who force Champions to fight against their will\", I will be severely disappointed. The lore community got rid of that bizarre interpretation years ago. Seeing Rioters fall back on this straw man again and again really adds insult to injury.)","replies":[{"poster":"Motajo","date":"2014-11-09T21:38:17.136+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"HA!

The most we know about them are that A) they are far more social than humans, relying on common social contact with other yordles to stay sane, even more so than a human and B) they are big on technology. I'm not a big fan of the fantasy world stereotyping that is common in these sorts of works (all elves are environmental protectors, all dwarves love to mine and drink) and having the same thing happen to one of the few things that make Runeterra interesting as a fantasy universe as opposed to yet another Tolkein-lite thing makes me incredibly annoyed. Though I guess that's more narrative's problem, than yours.\n\nSo if 'yordlifying' means that she starts doing overly adorable things or has a higher pitched voice or starts really liking cupcakes, I'm gonna be annoyed. It's not a bad idea in theory, but I don't know what you're even thinking of doing to her. Would you mind elaborating?

Currently she only has 30 secs - 1 min of dialogue, while Sion's newest VO is quite chatty at 15 minutes. She really needs a lot more things to say. I would like to see her have special interactions with Noxian assassins especially. Though try to give her an evil laugh with one of her abilities, she needs that ;).  \n\nI do like that idea of her being more like Brianna from Game of thrones. A knight who happens to be female, rather then a female knight (That sounds really strange, but there is an important distinction there). She's gruff, tough, but still a knight.\n\nAs for gameplay I've kinda gotten this notion of her being an anti-ADC. I feel like she's the type who would take risks tower diving to kill a champion, or even the type who would wade right into the middle of the enemy team to kill the problematic champion or save an ally. That no matter what is thrown at her, she can absorb and keep moving forward. She's like Braum, but is not Braum! She does not protect with her shield, she protects with her hammer.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Siachi","date":"2014-11-09T06:12:03.314+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"**Keep in mind I'm not the biggest Poppy player**, and you should probably head the opinions of people who play her MUCH more than I do.\n\nIf the lore team has to remove Poppy-as-a-diplomat, I should hope they **avoid **making her a 'loves to brawl' character like Vi; that'd almost feel like a disservice to her character. I don't think she'd be the kind of character who fights because \"*I was bored*\" or \"*It brings me glory*\" or even \"*They made me angry*\". Poppy feels like the kind of character who, while she certainly wouldn't be afraid to fight, doesn't revel in it: More that she'd deal a quick, decisive blow to end a conflict before it gets too far out of hand.\n\n--\n\nThis is probably just me, but I don't really see her as much of an underdog character, although maybe it's just because I've always associated Rumble with being the underdog. For Rumble, even when he IS fighting, his mech is still made of junk and is always on the verge of falling apart, so even then you don't think much of him, no matter how much success he's had. Even his goal for joining the League of the Legends was basically \"I want Yordles to start getting the respect they deserve!\" If that doesn't scream underdog, I don't know what is.\n\nPoppy, however, feels like the kind of character who'd only need to fight in one battle before the whole army knows who she is. I've heard someone think of her as \"The only Yordle a Noxian might actually respect.\" While she didn't start out as much, just being a blacksmith's daughter, she's definitely made a name for herself, and a reputation to be respected. \n\n---\n\n**But that could just be me**. Referring to my disclaimer above, you should probably pay more attention to people who have invested more into Poppy than I have.\n\nEDIT: **tl;dr**, Poppy seems like a character who, while she's not afraid to fight, would rather end the fight quickly and decisively so it doesn't get out of hand. Also, while I wouldn't be upset if you decided to go the more underdog route with Poppy, I feel like Rumble is better suited for that character space. Poppy, on the other hand, is more of a 'really made a name for herself' character.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ShÃ­ny","date":"2014-11-09T05:18:34.001+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just a quick thought i had about poppy and her diplomat identity.\nDiplomat in general means to me having a more \"big picture\" view of the world, Yordles for the most part are quite big on community and it seems like they seldom actually leave their community/Bandle city(except heimer's group) and at times seem xenophobic(rumble) . Poppy is different, shes out there talking with the \"giants\" and *demanding* that yordles be recognized on the political stage.\nWhy not make poppy an even bigger political powerhouse and have her be more than a diplomat for demacia and have her be the diplomat bandle city turns to when negotiations become heated.Bar room negotiations in bilgewater?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Linna Excel","date":"2014-11-09T06:41:58.970+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":">That said, I'm open to ideas.

What makes us root for the underdog? What allows us to feel what drives her?\n\nFirstly and this is a minor point, but i think she should keep her tails.  In fact I kind of wish 2-3 more females had that hairstyle in game besides her and sona.\n\nVisually?  I really love her scale armor.  I think that should stay put.  I also like the gold-dark teal color theme.  Her shield might need another color on it.  Maybe a crest or something.  Could be in teal, blue, purple, or red.\n\nI'm not sure what should be done with the hammer.  Should it be a simple blacksmith's hammer?  Should it be a war hammer she or her father forged?  Dunno.  All I know is blacksmith's poppy hammer is a little too outthere for me.  I really like the scarlet hammer and battle regalia hammer.  I wouldn't call the current hammer bad, but there feels like room for improvement.\n\nWhat players feel about Poppy is a difficult thing and here's why: she has different groups of players who follow her.  I can basically put her into 3 crowds: supports, tanky bruisers, and assassins.  I can't speak for the support players, but the tanks want to be in the thick of things, and assassins love being able to pick off someone while completely surrounded by the enemy team.\n\nIf there's one thing all poppy players feel is a sort of sense of being an unstoppable force if you get fed.  If the other team feds you, that's like them giving you permission to put a Vulcan Death Grip on their balls.  If you get fed as poppy (at least pre rework), you know that the game is yours to win or lose.\n\nTrue in game story.  I got fed as a Poppy one game.  The other teams middle inner tower was down and their inhib was up.  My team was off doing... something?  I didn't really care at the time.  I had my ult up and I was walking in that front door.  So what happened?  They sent a fed yi (12+ kills maybe) with a GA up and an aatrox with his passive up.  I took out both of their revive effects, killed one of them, and was about to kill the other when an AP ezreal jumped in and won the fight for them.\n\nThat is what a fed poppy feels like... kicking in the front door and causing trouble.  A fed poppy feels like split pushing mid because it sounds like fun at the time.\n\nAs for character examples, I've got 2 good ones for you.\n\nThe first is Rocky during Rocky 1 and 2.  Poppy is a champ you have to beat early.  Apollo might have won laning (Rocky 1) but he didn't beat Rocky (Poppy).  Maybe he got the tower first (won the first fight) but she (in this case Rocky) picked up kills or enough CS to get to late game.  Rocky 2 is Poppy's late game or when Poppy gets fed.  If the champ doesn't whip you outright in the first match, you are going to beat him in the second.\n\nThe other example is when your ult is up, you feel like a vorpal bunny single-handedly attacking a group of heavily armored knights.  As long as you ult the person who doesn't have the holy hand grenade of antioch, all is fine.\n\nWe need a Vorpal Bunny Poppy skin.\n\n*Looks at Iron Stylus*\n\n**STARE..**","replies":[{"poster":"Siachi","date":"2014-11-09T16:15:49.712+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd personally be more in favor of her weapon being a refitted blacksmith's hammer (is 'refitted' the right term?

I'm actually wondering how a self-inflicting taunt might work on her kit (Poppy HAS to go after the one target, and you can't really cancel the command), but that's not really something I've put much thought into.\n\nLike I've said in my own post, while it's not out of the question for Poppy to get to be the 'underdog' character, I feel like Rumble would be a better choice for that type of character.

She does it because no one else will. The sense I always got from lines like \"Let me demonstrate HAMMER diplomacy!\" and whatnot was that she's a natural warrior who simply refuses to complain about being placed in a profession (diplomat) that she isn't really cut out for, and on the battlefield - when she's finally in her element - she wants to show that she hasn't forgotten her duties.\n\nDoes that mean a reworked Poppy needs to be a diplomat? Not at all. But what it does mean is that whatever her lore is, it needs to demonstrate that she has a lot of heart, and while she's a fighter to the core she's more than willing to fill other roles out of love and loyalty.\n\nShe reminds me of a tiny, female, hammer-wielding Braum... except that Braum doesn't strike me as the type who'd set aside his larger-than-lifestyle to fill a practical role his people need.

Blomgrun, her father, was Bandle City's finest smith. The only thing he loved as much as his work was his young daughter, Poppy - named for the sprightly sounds of the sparks that leapt from his ever-burning forge. He swelled with pride the day she was first able to lift his trusty hammer, Whomper. Poppy immediately took to his art, demonstrating a natural gift for smithing, which Blomgrun honed with devoted instruction.\n> \n> One day, a Demacian general named Florin Berell commissioned Blomgrun to craft a helm, glorious beyond comparison. Blomgrun toiled away on this project, determined to present Florin with his finest work. He let Poppy set the center jewel, entrusting her with the most important piece. When the pair finished, they departed for Demacia to deliver it in person. Word of the general's order, however, was leaked to the Noxian High Command, and two Noxian assassins were dispatched to intercept the delivery. Blomgrun was able to occupy the assassins long enough for Poppy to escape with the prized helm. She watched helplessly from the brush as her father was slain. Instead of fleeing home, she carried the helm the rest of the way to Demacia alone. She refused payment for it, saying that no amount would compensate for her father's life. Instead, she offered it as a gift, honoring her father's final intentions. Florin saw the grim determination behind the tears in her eyes, and requested that the leadership of Bandle City appoint Poppy as the yordle ambassador to Demacia. Soon after, seeking to crush Noxus with her father's hammer, Poppy volunteered for the League of Legends.\n\nWhile on this subject, how 'Anti-Noxus' should she be? I personally don't really see her as someone like Varus who'd go on a Noxian slaughter spree, but with what they did to her father, who was mostly an innocent bystander in the whole Noxus-Demacia Conflict, I don't see Poppy as one to simply shrug the incident off, either.","replies":[{"poster":"Nameless Hero","date":"2015-03-06T13:39:01.320+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Siachi,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=peURE4rM,comment-id=0005000c00000000,timestamp=2014-11-11T18:03:25.229+0000)\n>\n> Nope; she got to be a diplomat basically because Demacia respected her for completing her father's task, despite what happened to him.\n> \n> Here's the full backstory, just because I'm too lazy to cut it down to the relevant details.\n> \n> While on this subject, how 'Anti-Noxus' should she be?

I'm more interested what players **feel** viscerally when they play or want to play Poppy. What makes her compelling at her core? What makes her speak to the pint-sized terror in all of us? What makes us root for the underdog? What allows us to feel what drives her?\n\nHope it's not too late to give feedback. I think Brienne of Tarth is an excellent reference point.\n\nPersonality-wise, Poppy strikes me as the embodiment of innocence lost too early.\n\nShe is serious because her past caused there to be little room for any real childhood. She had to be strong too soon and thus, isn't the best at being sociable. Her goal is to ensure peace, and she accomplishes this by emulating those most commonly associated as warriors of truth and justice - strong, masculine figures of Demacia. This is why her persona seems a bit darker than the more commonly jovial Yordles. It isn't that she doesn't like or know how to be happy, she just isn't used to the feeling.\n\nI feel that Poppy represents similar values to that of the fist holding greeting used in Wushu.\n\nShe is neither arrogant or high-handed. She values morals, intellect, physical and aesthetic education. While she may not be of noble blood, she is of noble mind. She seeks to embody valor and vigor, being brave without wishing to cause trouble or breaking the rules. She is ready to fight for what she believes in, but she will use her words and mind before she uses her fists.\n\nIf and when her hand is forced, it is a no nonsense fight. She will seek to end the conflict swiftly with all her might but she is not without mercy. She would subdue, not kill. Unlike the other Yordles which rely more on gadgetry or wits, she wears armour proudly and bears arms like a warrior of any other race. She stands strong and fights on regardless of disadvantage, her will unshakeable.\n\nShe shares traits with Garen, sure, but I see Garen as a patriot above all else. Poppy wants to be taken seriously regardless of her race, status or stature. Poppy may be a paragon of Demacian values, but unlike Garen, she fights for all innocents.\n\nThe big eventually fall far and hard while the small merely get tripped, so they get up again and again.

She's no nonsense and will take to a show of force than try and sweet talk you.\n\nIf i were to infer how she became the way she is; my guess is that she's always been a bit serious for a yordle but her father's death was a turning point. With the opportunity to be an ambassador arose she took it not because she wants power in anyway but she saw it as her duty.   Yordles are likely looked down upon literally and figuratively in much of Valoran, which makes them targets to be taken advantage of. Poppy is a yordle that can bring a serious respectable face to yordle kind and try to curry allies to a small but powerful race.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Thanotos Omega","date":"2015-03-06T14:46:24.140+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For me everything about Poppy builds from the foundation of Blacksmithing, She's really strong from years at the forge, when the world tries to break her it only tempers her, just like she does metal,\n\nWhen she became a diplomat she realized that Demacia Noxus and Targon all place missive emphasis on martial prowess, as does the growing militant faction of Iona, So she complimented Whomper with the best armor and shield she could make and trained herself using a combination of raw brute strength and incredible equipment compensate for lack of experience,\n\nAllowing her to earn the respect of people like Darius and Garen, and helping to grant her  a more authoritative presence,\n\nSome day J4 Riven Karma MF and the like will make their homelands better places, But it will be Poppy who takes that and brings them together to make the world better,\n\n\nAlso this whole thing about Diplomat not being in her Kit, Where is Quinn's Drawing in her's?

I feel the stoicism of \"this is my decision of tunnel-dive you\" because this evokes **resolution of purpose**. Your proposition translates into a lane bully mentality, but in a gameplay standpoint I would like to feel better when I'm helping my teamates in anything from a 2v1 to a 5v5. Poppy exists for diplomacy that is taking care of the matters of the collective of people who she protects, translated into game to **team decisions** like ganking or teamfighting, and no dueling and lane bullying. I would choose 1v1 to be a weak-spot for her instead, in exchange for a \"from peeling to diving\" gameplay.\n\n> - Conviction and loyalty.

Diplomats exists for the well-being of those who they represent, and the're invested with representative power. If one needs to twist oaths for this, they'll do it. If they need to forge new ones, they'll do it too. Poppy is the only champion in the roster that actually speaks the word \"Valoran\"; she's NOT for real \"her own little one-yordle army\". If she has a binding is to the Yordle race, those who she represents, and not to any rules. She will forge and break any of it FOR THEM, and that's the \"diplomat feeling\" that your are missing. Trade the word \"Diplomat\" for \"Representative\" and you're done.\n\n# I seriously recommend for you to play a game of *Exalted* as an Eclipse to take the feel of what \"being a diplomat\" means in the **High Level** of gaming psychology. Playing as Children of Gaia in *Werewolf: The Apocalypse* helps too. It's all that core of \"I will bring harmony to my people\" (maybe for some at high costs) that you are missing.

Thematically, I feel like her story is significant in and of itself (simple daughter of a working-class yordle, called to greatness by a.) circumstances outside her control and b.) her overwhelming sense of duty). It's her tragic story combined with her stoic response that really drives it home for me. *[VO reference opportunity: \"I didn't ask for this...\", don't miss out!]*\n\n2. She's the only non-comedic yordle ({{champion:32}} comes close), and has a matching voice and lines. While she definitely needs a re-do, changing her to be, say, all revenge-driven would drive her straight into the {{champion:58}} {{champion:236}} {{champion:104}} niche. Nothing inspires fear in your enemies quite like a hammer, a stoic resolve, and a strong distaste for dramatic monologues. If you're looking for more references for the stoic, no-nonsense-yet-lovable character take a quick look at Artie from Warehouse 13.\n\n3. As for stray ideas, I've always imagined her E: Heroic Charge to be really sloppy in it's actual execution. Imagine, if you will, a raging dive through the air onto her enemy, but overestimating the force needed, causing both to fall over on the ground. Goes hand-in-hand with the \"little ball of fury\" idea we all love. Other stray idea: Certain champs' nearby jokes cause Poppy to say \"...I don't get it.\" or the like. I think that tops, \"I don't know any jokes\", but leaves the same impression.\n\n4.

Poppy gains bonus dmg but buff disappears if she dies. 90 seconds cooldown\n\n\nGameplay:\nActivating her ult makes her whole team more tanky and powerful at the cost of her own safety. The small range is to encourage her allies to dive in with her. Activating her ult means that smart enemies will try to focus her to kill the buff = she will draw all the aggro. Teamwise, it would combo with Sivir's ulti, Garen, Amumu and Tristana's W. It would also make her vulnerable to Darius and any kind of cc. Players will have to build tenacity and tank items to make full use of the ult or else they would die early. Smart players need to choose exactly **when ** to use the ult for maximum effect.
