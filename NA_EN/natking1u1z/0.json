Or they'll use my ult as a chance for them to escape because they know once the ult goes up its an all in for the other team SO MY TEAM RUNS.\r\n\r\nSo my last game, these guys were getting slaughtered 4 v 4, I had sight of my top laner the majority of the time. I felt as if I didn't need to split push to a losing team fight for the simple fact of how many times the enemy JG would get kills I mean it was ridiculous. From early to mid game this guy was nuking shit. The enemy jg even tried ganking my lane as I was overextended and taking tower plates but that didn't work out for him.\r\n\r\nI take the top lane tower and decide to go mid and help out, bad idea because just as I explained before my team uses my presence as a bait to escape. I mean this is a normal draft match so it is what it is but all boils down to MMR and game matches why do I keep getting bad team comps when I have a high win rate with certain champs.\r\n\r\nSo during the endgame chat, these lames say I was avoiding team fights, half correct. I was split pushing like hell trying to get us a lead. NONE I mean none of these players had the common sense to split push any lane they just sat and waited for the enemy team to regroup and would die.\r\n\r\nI'm not diving into a fight where I know I'm going to be left to soak up all the damage there is only so much illaoi can do and take by herself. At one point during the game, I sat in a bush and baited the enemy jg and support two kills then I got two more kills then had to bail because of low health, only at that moment was this team reliable.\r\n\r\nThey say I'm toxic because I'm telling and asking in a demanding tone of text of course, to push the damn lanes. I mean the concept of meta so simple but then again if I'm not confident in my teammate's abilities then I'm not risking taking any L's.\r\n\r\nSomeone on Reddit told me to focus on pushing myself in low elo.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-12-08T06:36:07.164+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"Reviewing that game on op.gg, it looks like everyone on both teams is wood V and nobody has any idea what they are doing, probably equal blame.\n\nOn one side, you contributed utterly nothing to that game and did not get yourself or anyone else ahead.\n\nOn the other side, your team did basically nothing either.\n\nThat said, the other team also did nothing, with a total of 3 kills and 0 turrets.

If I feel comfortable and confident with a champ to the point where I earn S grades or outperform the enemy lanner I feel I have the right to experiment with different builds for whatever champ. For example, I took Glacial Augment and outplayed Sylas so what is your point. \n\nYou're replying solely with your ego as what every other player's do in this community.\n\n\n> Special mention: in a world with trinkets, all players on both teams have single-digit ward counts.

Obviously you only replied to flame, because you do not like my title and you are a, been playing since S1 LoL fanboy.\n\nIf you are going to talk shit get your facts straight.
