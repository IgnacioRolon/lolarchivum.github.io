So his passive, Ki Barrier, gives a shield on SPELL CAST. I love to play Shen on my other account and I&#039;ve noticed that he never gets his shield until the end of his dash. Now it say on spell cast so I thought that its just a little tweak that might help him a little in ganks.\r\n\r\nSecond, I think changing Rengar&#039;s Q back to its original state was a HUGE mistake. Now he&#039;s just supplying too much damage. I mean come on Riot, a insta crit with his R, and a double Q? Too much. If you&#039;re running exhaust you&#039;d have to be a god to pop it on him before he jumps you.\r\n\r\nThird, I understand that you&#039;re giving Illaoi a cool skin and showing her some love because it SEEMS like she&#039;s been left in the dust. Illaoi is just way too powerful. Let&#039;s take a look here at Illaoi.\r\n\r\n1. You can&#039;t beat her early. You cant win level one, two, or three.\r\n\r\n2. You basically can&#039;t fight her, and she just shoves wave into turret. Ok cool, I can CS under tower well. Sike, she&#039;s going to Q and throw her tentacle skill shot out of turret range and continue to damage you. \r\n\r\n3. Your jungler comes to gank you. Let&#039;s assume you&#039;re playing someone like Camile or Darius. You&#039;ve CC&#039;d her and are attempting to kill her. Hey, let me just grab your soul and R. I&#039;ve just now taken half of your and your junglers health with a empowered auto on a 4 second cool down.\r\n\r\n5. 7 MAN ULT, KILLS TWO FOR PRICE OF ONE.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-03-11T04:34:37.657+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"I AM ONE PERSON WITH STRONG OPINIONS REEEEEE\"","replies":[]}]}
