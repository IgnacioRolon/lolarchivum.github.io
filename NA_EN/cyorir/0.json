I readily admit it, and won't pretend otherwise. Yet for some reason, all of my recent games (playing in normal draft as a level 27) have seen me matched with players at a very wide range of skill levels - including Golds, Platinums, and Diamonds, in addition to the bronze and silver players who are closer to my skill level. This leads to a pretty wide skill imbalance, which is frustrating for both the lower level players like me and the higher level players playing with me. It almost always leads to someone raging about how trash I am. Of course, some players will offer advice, but they are in the minority. Is this matching of lower-skilled champions with higher-ranked champions a mistake, or purposeful? If it's purposeful, I feel to see the point - it would be great if the better players offered constructive criticism, but that's sadly not something most League players do. I am being notified that a lot of my reports are going through, but I can't help but feel like matchmaking is lacking at the moment.","replies":[{"poster":"Beerstein","date":"2019-04-27T17:42:25.336+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=cyorir,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=MNMfWidw,comment-id=,timestamp=2016-08-11T21:06:55.459+0000)\n>\n> Ok, so I'm not very good at League.

A LOT. I'd duo with them (I've never been above silver) and we went so far as getting matched against someone in Master league with their new friend.\n\nIt's always been a problem, along with permabanning (instead of perma chat banning) players. Basically, new players get the worst of the worst scum of league, and quit. I'd say the population is likely half (or worse) of what it would otherwise be if Riot actually tried to address these issues.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SamwiseGC","date":"2019-05-01T16:24:23.249+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"soo 3 years and no fix i dont duo... i keep getting matched with 100+ people im not a smurf and new to the game...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gary B Enkelis","date":"2016-08-12T03:05:09.587+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As soon as you hit 30 and go to rank maybe you'll find more balanced games.","replies":[{"poster":"xXI3ADI3OYXx","date":"2016-08-12T03:20:09.090+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"lets hope so, as long as i dont run into fools like usual in bot games lol","replies":[{"poster":"HyggeHejsa","date":"2019-04-27T17:38:00.372+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It doesn't get better.

Smurfing is an issue that is very hard to solve. When a newer player feels frustrated like you have been and the older, more experienced, players have to play with someone that is not at the same level, toxicity runs rampant. Once you get to a certain level you expect things that newer players may not do or understand. This is most easily seen in the bot lane.\n\nIt is frustrating, but I don't see any way around it.
