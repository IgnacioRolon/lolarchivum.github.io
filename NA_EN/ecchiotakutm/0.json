Similarly, I don&#x27;t associate turtles with life steal.\n\nBears do run pretty fast when on chase, since they will be on all fours and have enough muscles for the job most of the time; and the \"stunning\" aspect of the bear stance makes total sense, considering the infamous bear slaps, I think giving you stuns is already pretty modest.\n\nThe turtle stance does give a shield, makes sense. As for the life-steal, it's now changed for the Xin's W passive model where he kinda just heals himself periodically after every few strikes for some reason, which can make sense given that turtles are often associated with living long lives.\n\nSo yeah on these 2 examples/cases alone, I don't think Udyr's theme and in-game execution is off tbh.","replies":[{"poster":"Arakadia","date":"2017-06-07T20:18:53.314+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"His bear stance DOES reflect what a bear does.

His bear stance DOES NOT feel like what a monk of spiritual power channeling the power of a bear does. \n\nWhat do you mean, bear does give chase and hunt themselves (not too much of a predator most of the time, but they do hunt). And they claw people with slaps so strong most things die from 1 hit if direct-impact. It makes perfect sense that Bear Stance makes him run fast for a short period and stun people on-hit.\n \n> And his life steal does not make sense. Turtles should live longer via creating extra health maybe, or increased health regeneration, NOT through stealing their longevity via attacking others.\n\nAs I was saying, it no longer leeches HP (or in this case, \"life\"). It's now like Xin, they just heal themselves passively with striking as a trigger for un-explained reasons and mechanisms, it's \"healing\", not \"life-stealing\" (the heal amount also scales with his own HP and not damage dealt). Which can make sense, you can just say that Udyr triggers the healing in battle to stay alive.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Sauceyapples","date":"2017-06-07T18:49:17.454+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Arakadia,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=KWZRj7P0,comment-id=000000010000,timestamp=2017-06-07T06:00:30.129+0000)\n>\n> He looks like a hobo wearing animal furs and trash bags.\n\nWait he's notsupposed to be that?
