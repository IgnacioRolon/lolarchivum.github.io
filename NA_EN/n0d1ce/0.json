Q is slow, E is basically useless in team fights away from enemy minions, R is super clunky.  Everything about Sion looks cool.  In a video.  Then you play him and realize Riot wrecked your favorite champion.\r\n\r\nHe's a tank?  Why?  He has no defensive steroid.  His W \"free\" HP comes at the cost of losing 700 base HP first, Wow nice thanks Riot.\r\n\r\ndelete R delete passive delete Q, buff W to 0.9 AP buff E to 0.9 AP and make it a line skill shot without needing minions, then maybe ill play Sion again.  I would rather have 2 useful skills over 4 useless ones.\r\n\r\nOh and hes way too big.  I doubt a Sion will dodge a skillshot ever.","replies":[{"poster":"Commando Yi","date":"2014-10-10T17:31:57.559+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"this fellow is quite knowledgeable on all matters league related, particularly matters concerning sion\n\ni am in no way acquainted with him and am offering this as an unbiased opinion","replies":[{"poster":"vargo","date":"2014-10-10T18:07:41.392+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> this fellow is quite knowledgeable on all matters league related, particularly matters concerning sion\n> \n> i am in no way acquainted with him and am offering this as an unbiased opinion\n\ni think i should listen to OP I could learn a thing or two.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2014-10-10T18:14:52.229+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Learn how to play him.
