So it looks like all of us who have this ISP are in the dumpster.  Which sucks for me, because they're about the only ISP I can get where I live, ATT can't reach me, Verizon pulled FIOS from Ohio afiak, and we don't have any of those FTH smaller providers here in Ohio, at least not in Central Ohio.\n\nThanks for looking into it Digital Ram, I appreciate your effort.\n\nTracing route to 192.64.170.40 over a maximum of 30 hops\n\n  1    <1 ms    <1 ms    <1 ms  192.168.0.1 \n  2     9 ms    12 ms     8 ms  d4-50-1-35.try.wideopenwest.com [50.4.35.1] \n  3    13 ms    12 ms    10 ms  76-73-166-77.knology.net [76.73.166.77] \n  4    11 ms     9 ms     9 ms  76-73-167-206.knology.net [76.73.167.206] \n  5    24 ms    11 ms    16 ms  76-73-167-89.knology.net [76.73.167.89] \n  6    13 ms    11 ms    16 ms  76-73-166-126.knology.net [76.73.166.126] \n  7    13 ms     9 ms    12 ms  76-73-166-125.knology.net [76.73.166.125] \n  8    20 ms    22 ms    21 ms  static-69-73-0-139.knology.net [69.73.0.139] \n  9    31 ms    18 ms    27 ms  dynamic-75-76-35-10.knology.net [75.76.35.10] \n 10    28 ms    22 ms    22 ms  dynamic-75-76-35-6.knology.net [75.76.35.6] \n 11   190 ms   191 ms   192 ms  104.160.131.98 \n 12   208 ms   193 ms   184 ms  104.160.131.46 \n 13   195 ms   217 ms   185 ms  104.160.131.103 \n 14   202 ms   219 ms   222 ms  10.23.246.14 \n 15     *        *        *     Request timed out.\n 16     *        *        *     Request timed out.\n 17     *        *        *     Request timed out.\n 18     *        *        *     Request timed out.\n 19     *        *        *     Request timed out.\n 20     *        *        *     Request timed out.\n 21     *        *        *     Request timed out.\n 22     *        *        *     Request timed out.\n 23     *        *        *     Request timed out.\n 24     *        *        *     Request timed out.\n 25     *        *        *     Request timed out.\n 26     *        *        *     Request timed out.\n 27     *        *        *     Request timed out.\n 28     *        *        *     Request timed out.\n 29     *        *        *     Request timed out.\n 30     *        *        *     Request timed out.\n\nTrace complete.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nefas","date":"2016-03-04T20:21:43.103+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"SE Michigan, WOW!.

Riot has finally responded to my ticket and gave some promising news.\n\n> You're correct, Duxy, we're in discussions with WOW right now as their service between their customers and our servers is experiencing issues that they will need to resolve. Unfortunately, I can't promise a particular timeline as we do still need to wait for them to make changes before it will affect things positively. You can assist by contacting WOW yourself, as a customer, and making sure that your local supporter knows of the situation.\n\n>When you talk to your ISP tell them that you have been experiencing ping spikes while playing League, an online game whose servers are located in Chicago, Illinois. When running a trace to our servers in Chicago (using IP address 192.64.170.252) you experience ping spike or packet loss shown on certain nodes in the WinMTR tracer below. These hops are all owned by either your ISP or their backbone provider. These problems weren't seen before, and other services do not exhibit the same issues. This is severely impacting your service, and your ISP or their backbone provider needs to look into these node and any others that might be impacting your route to the League servers.\n\n>~ Rubik\nHextech Support\nTrickster of Piltover\n\nSo it appears this is an issue with WOW but Riot is trying to work with them on it.
