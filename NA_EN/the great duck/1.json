If the outer turrets were significantly weaker than inner turrets, then it would add in a natural brake to snowballing - sure, being a thousand gold ahead means you'll win most straight up fights at low levels, but a thousand gold won't do diddly squat if a turret shot from an inner turret at the seven minute mark knocks off more than half your health.\n\n\"First turrets protect you, then you protect turrets\" is a decent idea - it changes them from obstacles to objectives as the game goes on - but right now the champion power delta from start of game to even the fifteen minute mark is so large that there's no way to recover from a loss, since turrets go from \"dangerous\" to \"delicious candy\" too fast. And yes, competitive games are generally better in an unstable environment (that is, games are more fun when securing a lead results in a genuine mechanical advantage), but it's possible to go too far, to the point where the entire match is decided by who gets first blood + first tower.\n\nIncreasing the power gradient between turret tiers means that if you lose the early game, you still can pull back, hunker under T2 turret, farm, and hope to recover. You'll lose map and objective pressure, sure, but you won't be demanding for the ability to surrender at 15 because of mid+jg gank bot lane that nobody noticed coming.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ZT Xperimentor","date":"2017-04-16T17:06:01.934+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"Twenty minutes?
