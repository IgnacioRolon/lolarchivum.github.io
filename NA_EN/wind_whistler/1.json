When they do, make sure your minion stays alive, but let him tank as much damage as possible. Repeat this process until you start to have 2 up at every camp and proceed to clear camps while taking no damage at all.","replies":[{"poster":"TheWoollyMammoth","date":"2015-11-16T00:08:15.520+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"He is able to level 3 drag if you know how. its tricky but look up Aquadragon33's ad malz jungle guide.
