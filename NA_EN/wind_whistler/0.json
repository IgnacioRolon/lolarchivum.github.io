If you were talking about Sion, yeah, I would agree with you, because his playrate DEFINITELY went up. Poppy, too, I guess, although to a much lesser extent. Galio's playrate went up, but to be honest, it's the same case with Sion. They made an entirely new champion. Granted, there's nothing wrong with today's Sion and Galio- In fact, they're great champions. They just didn't need to remove the old ones. Poppy is the complete opposite of what she was supposed to be, but she still has elements of her old kit, at least, and she's still a blue yordle, I guess.\n\nYorick's playrate is almost the same as it was before. I think I might even see him a little bit LESS than I used to. There are NOT hundreds of thousands of people who play him. Yorick doesn't look, sound, or play anything like he used to. I've tried him before. I actually felt BAD for my laner, because there was pretty much nothing they could do. But once I was out of laning phase, I was almost always fucking useless.\n\nThis isn't a new form of Yorick. This is a different Yorick. The Yorick I loved playing is gone, as is Galio, and soon, Urgot. Then they'll hit Cho'Gath, and when they do that... God. I wont' know what to do anymore. Thanks for at least understanding that I'm in a lot of pain. That's more than most other people can do.\n\nAlso, I feel really bad for Rek'Sai. She's received nothing but nerfs ever since she was released, and it wasn't for a brief period of time, either. They've been giving her nerfs in 2014. They've been giving her nerfs in 2015. 2016. Even in 2017, I think, she's been nerfed. They've fucking hit everything she had. Her damage, her mobility, her sustain, her utility, her tankiness- They even made her fucking model smaller for some reason. All of this is because of the LCS, and that stupid fucking knock up she has. I don't know exactly what they have in store for her, but something definitely needs to change, because I almost never see Rek'Sai nowadays.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-05-16T03:43:14.727+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I suggest you try cow clicker.

Instead, you listen to everyone else, rather than forming your own opinion. I actually thought he sucked ass at first, too, and every time I got him in ARAM, I ended up doing terribly. But somewhere down the line, I found out that I wasn't actually doing as bad as I thought I was. He began to grow on me, and I actually found him to be very fun. One of the funnest champions in the game. It's a shame you've deprived yourself of such a wonderful experience, but I guess not everyone can be as fortunate as I had been.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-05-16T20:22:43.162+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Bad troll is bad.","replies":[{"poster":"Wind Whistler","date":"2017-05-16T21:35:36.658+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MagicFlyingLlama,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=QymEzIj2,comment-id=000400000000,timestamp=2017-05-16T20:22:43.162+0000)\n>\n> Bad troll is bad.\n\nLoving a champion that was wrongfully removed from the game makes me a troll?

Nearly all of my posts I've ever made about stuff like this has been downvoted to hell and back. It never really surprised me, though. People can't understand Yorick. Why would they be able to understand someone who mained him?\n\nAlso, I may have exaggerated a bit. While I do grieve almost every day about him, I rarely cry. It happens, but it happens rarely.\n\nAlso, there's a difference between having your main ruined (like Mordekaiser mains in the Juggernaut update, or Malzahar mains in the MYMU), and having your main essentially removed from the game.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Mecha MaIphite","date":"2017-05-16T03:16:27.277+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What I do understand is the frustration of getting pushed out of lane because my opponent mashed his buttons on me without really needing to aim or set up his spells.","replies":[{"poster":"Wind Whistler","date":"2017-05-16T04:44:03.457+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Mecha MaIphite,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=QymEzIj2,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-05-16T03:16:27.277+0000)\n>\n> What I do understand is the frustration of getting pushed out of lane because my opponent mashed his buttons on me without really needing to aim or set up his spells.\n\nIf you actually got pushed out of lane by a Yorick, you're fucking pathetic. His range was still relatively low, he had mana problems, and his cooldowns were high for someone who relied so heavily on his ghouls. If you had a problem with Yorick early game, the only person to blame for being upset is yourself.","replies":[]}]}]}
