In the case of toxicity, players are not usually escalated to an immediate permanent suspension unless there is an extreme amount of toxicity displayed, often involving hate speech or death threats.  The other infractions which can result in immediate permanent suspensions are typically things like use of malicious third party programs (scripts, bots, hacks, etc), elo boosting, account sharing.  \n\nThe only ones who can overturn a suspension are Player Support, to contact them you will need to submit a [ticket here](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) but be aware that in the case of toxicity, they do not overturn or shorten any punishments issued by the Instant Feedback System unless it was done so in error.  Typically, only bans issued in error are overturned.  Though, if you are serious about wishing to redeem yourself, you are free to make a new account and demonstrate that dedication to following the rules on it.","replies":[{"poster":"Drackonite","date":"2017-04-08T00:59:21.193+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it was because of toxicity but i didn't death threaten anyone","replies":[{"poster":"OnlyYouCanHearMe","date":"2017-04-08T22:04:28.295+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you would like for us to review your chat logs and give you some feedback as to what in them caused your account to be escalated directly to a permanent suspension, feel free to post them here.  Without seeing them, we can only guess at what they might have contained, but the most common reason in this sort of scenario is hate speech.  Again, I'm not saying that this is part of your specific case, just that this is a trend in escalated punishments.    \n\nDid you use any sort of racial or homophobic slur?  Riot has a zero tolerance policy towards hate speech, which includes the use of words like n%%%%r, f%%%%t, and f%g.  Even if you are using them in a joking manner between friends in a game, it can still be highly offensive to the other players in the match, and is prohibited by the Terms of Use.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2017-04-01T01:23:45.799+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"So why do you only want to change AFTER you messed up?","replies":[{"poster":"Drackonite","date":"2017-04-08T01:00:16.445+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if i can change i can be a part of this complex game and everyone will have fun.","replies":[{"poster":"EvilDustMan","date":"2017-04-08T01:00:46.889+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Drackonite,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=Xcl9dYVe,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2017-04-08T01:00:16.445+0000)\n>\n> if i can change i can be a part of this complex game and everyone will have fun.\n\nShow us the chat logs.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"MissingKayo","date":"2017-04-01T01:24:26.336+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't deserve it.","replies":[{"poster":"Drackonite","date":"2017-04-08T01:02:38.843+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I personally don't think i deserve this  but i can just hope they consider un-perma banning so i have a chance to be a good community and helpful player.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"higura","date":"2017-04-08T01:50:53.415+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"riot don't \"just\" hand out perma bans for first offence because they feel like it, it eaiter have to do with billing order (in which case contact support) or you acted in a way thats so inexcusable that perma ban was the only reasonable action...","replies":[]}]}
