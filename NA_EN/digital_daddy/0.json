Sure you could buy a few skins and boosts like i did, but over all it&#039;s a fair system.\nSure some champions need to be a bit balanced, but nothings perfect the people who make the game are only human. \nAnyways thank you RIOT for such an amazing game!\n\no 3 o\n\nAlso don't like this post, it wasn't made for likes.

MMR and matchmaking are the good parts. The Leagues (ranking) system is what you really want to change. Because that system separates MMR and rank, such that rank is a terrible estimation of skill level, and it's very opaque. Rank is determined only through consistent performance (i.e. grinding for LP, promo series, and demotion protection), with an extra safe-guard to protect against Tier demotion. If you don't care about that extra consistency in your rank, and would rather have a simpler, more exact ranking system, then what you really want to ask for is to have the \"Leagues\" system removed/reworked, not MMR.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Paquay","date":"2017-04-26T00:20:24.538+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, the MMR logic is pretty dumb the way I see it. Maybe Riot has a reason for it that they could explain to me in pictures, but if you're in say Silver with a high MMR of Gold, and you're hovering at a 50% winrate because your MMR is right where it needs to be......   why not just be in Gold?\n\nIt's nonsensical.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Joseraph","date":"2017-04-26T16:39:45.601+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"People who want earlier ff times are why we can't have nice things.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hyperiön","date":"2017-04-27T15:46:02.229+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Now that you spoke words, lets see how to make your post better:\n\n1.
