That was the end of season 4.  Season 5 I went 8/2 got placed bronze I, only climbed to silver V.  Season 6 went 4/6 got placed bronze IV and climbed from there to silver V.  You're often placed higher than you should be your first season.  Play lots of ranked and you'll end up where you belong.  I'm honestly only just now both able and willing to put in the effort to really get better, which is why I'm hoping to do better season 7.  Play to improve and you'll find yourself climbing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Digital Daddy","date":"2016-11-08T02:24:47.027+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Guys i started playing 5-6 months ago xD","replies":[{"poster":"NiamhNyx","date":"2016-11-08T02:26:23.366+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Digitalpoketmon,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=l2dyxr2b,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2016-11-08T02:24:47.027+0000)\n>\n> Guys i started playing 5-6 months ago xD\n\nSweet so i was right :P you were like \"YESS NOT BRONZE!!!\"","replies":[{"poster":"Digital Daddy","date":"2016-11-08T02:27:13.730+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=NiamhNyx,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=l2dyxr2b,comment-id=00030000,timestamp=2016-11-08T02:26:23.366+0000)\n>\n> Sweet so i was right :P you were like &quot;YESS NOT BRONZE!!!&quot;\n\nToo bad season ends tonight :|","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"NiamhNyx","date":"2016-11-08T02:23:31.763+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think hes like \"YESS NOT BRONZE!!!\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"69469238DEL1","date":"2016-11-08T02:22:59.787+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can't tell if your upset or not","replies":[]},{"poster":"I am Pacman","date":"2016-11-08T02:21:42.985+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thats average? \n\nThe system starts you off in silver 4 mmr, you play promos and based on that can be placed anywhere between bronze to gold.","replies":[]}]}
