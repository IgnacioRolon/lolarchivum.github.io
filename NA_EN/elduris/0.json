I clicked on the Live Client!","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey everyone,\n\nRiot has noticed increased reports of players who are trying to run the live client, but the PBE consistently appears instead.  Since this can be incredibly frustrating to run into, here are a few temporary solutions while they work on a more permanent fix:\n\n*NOTE:  This only should affect Windows OS*\n\n#***Solution 1***\n\n* Instead of clicking on your normal League of Legends shortcut, go to your \"Riot Games\" or \"League of Legends\" folder where you have it installed.  \n\n> Example:  C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\n\n* Run \"lol.launcher.admin.exe\"\n* If running \"lol.launcher.admin.exe\" works, you can create a shortcut to this launcher instead!\n\n#***Solution 2***\n\n* Open the \"Start\" Menu\n* Navigate to All Programs --> Accessories --> Run\n* Type \"regedit\" into the box and press \"Ok\"\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/RMUbtTO.png\n\n* In the tree view on the left hand side, expand:\n\n> Windows 32-bit --> \"HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Riot Games\\RADS\n\n> Windows 64-bit --> \"HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Wow6432Node\\Riot Games\\RADS\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/UissWQm.png\n\nScroll down...\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/fYMkP2J.png\n\n* On the right-hand side pane, there should be a item with the name \"LocalRootFolder\"\n* Right click on the \"LocalRootFolder\" and select \"Modify...\"\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/K4tnhyy.png\n\n* Change the \"Value data\" entry to the path of the \"RADS\" folder inside the LoL install location you wish to run. For example, the standard install location is:\n\n> \"C:/Riot Games/League of Legends/RADS\"\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/dNlEYPM.png\n\nThese solutions should fix it!

Still PBE. But then I ran the shortcut as administrator and it gave me the live client. \n\nAlso, the more permanent solution above is regedit. Be careful gents, there's no takesies-backsies with regedit.","replies":[]}]}
