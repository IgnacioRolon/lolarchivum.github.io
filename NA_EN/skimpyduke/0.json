On the PBE FAQ it says that new players are given large amount of RP and IP. It also says that you might have to restart your client to make it appear. It has been a week and I still don't have any RP or IP. I think I've restarted my client properly, but I might be doing it wrong. I also played the tutorial and I didn't get awarded anything. I did get raised to level 30 however, but if anyone could help me receive my RP and IP, it would be greatly appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-07T21:31:11.276+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's strange to hear that your PBE balance hasn't updated in over a week, as it should be regularly sync'd.  When you launch the PBE patcher, are you able to select the legacy client?  This is likely an issue between the two that's not syncing your correct balance.  Let me know if that works!","replies":[{"poster":"SkimpyDuke","date":"2017-01-08T01:22:01.007+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can select the legacy client but when I click on it, it says above the video with the client trailer \"You have joined the client update.\"  When I log into the game it is on the legacy client. Does this have something to do with me having to restart the client in a certain way?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-11T16:40:53.930+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your updated client may not have installed properly.

I don't know if I am doing something wrong or not. Is there any other solution to this problem? If not I will just earn the IP in game by playing games.
