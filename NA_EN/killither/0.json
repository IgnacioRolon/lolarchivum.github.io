What matters is if its PUNISHABLE.

Is there some audience out there yelling  \"OH MAN HE TOTALLY GOT BURNED BY THE GUY SPEWING HATE SPEECH!\"?  \n\nNo, there's not.  If someone rages and flames, just call him a silly goose and report him after the game.\n\nWhen you get reported the system doesn't care what anyone else says.  It doesn't care if you're being toxic on your own or \"just defending yourself\".  It just checks if you're toxic.  If you're toxic then it punishes. \n\nSaying I'm \"just defending myself\" is like  kids fighting at school and one kids points at another and says \"He started it.\"  The teachers don't care who started it.  They're just gonna punish everyone who was fighting.\n\nWhen it gets to the punishment part the system goes by escalating tiers.  If you get to the 14 week ban it makes it clear the next punishment  will be a permanent ban.  It doesn't matter if it's a \"minor offense\"  ANY punishment will be a perma.  \n\n\nIf you really can't understand where you went wrong now after reading this post and all the others on this thread, then definitely do NOT bother making a new account as you'll likely just make the same mistakes and get permabanned again.\n\nEdit :  Just saw Riot Tantrum posted.   Listen to him.  15 lifetime penalties.  That's numerous \"last chances\" and \"final warnings\".

To the best of my knowledge (someone who knows more than me, feel free to chime in) works a bit like this.\n\nIt checks on IF players are reported.  1 report and 9 reports against someone have the same weight.  \nIf anyone is reported it checks if they were an asshole in game. It just checks their logs, it doesn't care what anyone else says at that point.\n\nHow is this stupid?  Do you think you should get a free to rage and flame all you want so long as someone else does it first?  In RL do the police just stand by and let anyone who isn't a superpowered alien from another planet or a billionaire with fanciest equipment and years of combat and stealth training just dish out their own vigilante justice so long as \"the other guy did it first\"?\n\nWhat's stupid is that you have been told over and over where you went wrong and you refuse to accept any responsibility.  And yes, players can falsely report, but guess what.  If you're not an asshole, YOU WON'T GET PUNISHED!\n\nI have had tons of griefers, trolls, and easily offended people say they were going to report me.  I've even gotten the \"A player has reported you\" message a couple of times.  But I have NOT been punished because I'm not a raging asshole in my games.  \n\nI don't know how to explain this to you any better so you understand because at this point, you have not only spoon fed this information, but have had an IV implanted in your arm to directly inject you with it.     \n\nIf you want to be a raging asshole, go somewhere else.

I'll agree that it may not be fair to permanently ban someone for a very minor offense just because they had the 14 day ban previously, especially if it's a few months later where their account will go down in punishment escalations.\n\nOn the other hand though, to even get that 14 day ban in the first place you would either have had to go through several other punishment tiers or be so horrible(such as using kys or hatespeech) to blow past the lower tiers to the 14 day ban one, that you would have failed to heed the warning messages with the previous punishment.  Riot makes it completely crystal clear that after the 14 day ban, the next punishment is a perma.  They are also in full right to do this as the ToS states.  \n\nMost people don't have a problem with this as less than 1% of the playerbase has been permanently banned.  The one ban message I saw posted stated that like only 0.06% of players have been hit with the perma.  \n\nIf someone gets to this level then 99.9999999999% they completely deserved it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AriCei","date":"2017-09-20T00:14:36.268+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I wouldn't have gone there personally.\n\n\"It doesn't matter if it's a \"minor offense\" ANY punishment will be a perma.\"\nThe point is, this is out of touch and wrong, in any sense of it.

Well I dont screenshot every time I GET thank you for reporting XYZ players and keeping league of legends clean\n\nBut the last 10 Times it happend I can assure you the person reported got bunch of reports.
