Talon was doing similarly poor, but had good cs. \r\n\r\nOur jungler was securing objectives very well, along with me abondoning lane by 15 minutes to set up drag and baron with shrooms.\r\n\r\nBot was doing ok.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe got destroyed early game. Completely one sided for 20 minutes. We snuck a first dragon but lost the ensuing fight, and Trundle flash smited the second dragon, so we still had dragon control.\r\n\r\nLater in the game we decided to sneak a 4 man baron while the enemy team pushed bot hard. We got baron, they got the inhib. (Still completely behind)\r\n\r\nI spent the next 20 minutes shrooming up near the choke points of the inhib tower, where I expected the fights to occur.\r\n\r\nFinally, near the end of the game, I stealthed in the middle of the lane. They managed to hit *all 4* of my shrooms I set up 6 minutes ago as a team. I uncloaked and sniped Kalista, we counterengaged. Completely won the late game for my team, while Trundle kept us in the early-mid game by securing objectives.\r\n\r\nNever give up if you can read the game correctly, especially as a setup champion.
