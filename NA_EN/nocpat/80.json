The goal of this thread is to figure out *why* these attributes are as they are in terms of the whole balance of the game. We can brainstorm solutions if they come up, but the main point is to define, not solve here.\n\nI'll start with my own opinions based on observations, experiences, and general philosophy of balance. Some might be off, some might be spot on. Up to everyone to decide.\n\n\nI believe most problems stem from combinations of attributes that don't belong together. Attributes in this case are defined as a stat, type of gameplay, or general description. Here's an incomplete list of what I consider to be the attributes in league:\n\n* Offensive\n* Defensive\n* Utility\n* Burst\n* DPS\n* Sustain\n* Tankiness\n* Mobility\n* AD\n* AP\n* Penetration\n* %\n* Flat\n* Base\n* Scaling\n* Cost\n* Counterplay\n\nYou get the idea. Essentially buzzwords to cover a concept.\n\n\nOn their own, they're usually fine and balanced. It's when they get combined in a certain way on champions where it becomes problematic. I'll jump right into examples of champions and specifics, written poorly and in need of editing...\n\n\n* ***Kassadin*** \n+ A melee AP Assassin with heavy focus on mobility with a side of defense (MR favored). Medium AP base damage, medium AP/mana scaling. Medium burst, medium DPS. Medium single-target damage, medium aoe damage.\n- No sustain, high mana costs to limit his mobility. W encourages him to get in melee range to counteract the mana issues. Weak early game, medium mid-game, medium late game.\n\nOverall, Kassadin is middle of the road in terms of damage; not too high, not ignorable either. His mobility becomes high late game. Without items, his sustain and defense to AD are his weaknesses.\n\n\nNow onto what's problematic. The items he builds take away every one of his weaknesses, along with the Executioner's Mastery. Flask gives him sustain (health and mana) to hold him through the early and mid game. Rod of Ages makes him tanky, and offers more sustain (health and mana), as well as damage (which scales with his shield to give him tankiness from damage). From this point, with Boots, Flask, and Rod of Ages, he has only one weakness left: weakness to AD damage. The most efficient armor option should be built next, preferably Frozen Heart or Frozen Gauntlet.\n\nWith Boots, Flask, RoA, Frozen Heart, and correct runes/masteries, Kassadin is left as a tanky medium damage burst assassin with extremely high mobility and mild sustain. He does not have a weakness anymore, but he has clear strengths. This leaves him at an overall advantage to any champ he's compared to that is \"average\" or with a clear weakness. The appropriate counter would be to build MR due to his lack of AD. He can then build Void staff/Lyandries to invalidate your investment.\n\n\n\n**Problematic combinations:**\n\n* Tankiness + Gap Closers + Medium Damage\n* Building Offense that gives Defense (Q shield, Executioner's Mastery)\n* Permanent % Magic Penetration (Void Staff)\n\n\nEvery champion has an attribute breakdown like this. The powerful ones will have their own combos. I invite everyone to figure out which champions have which.\n\n\n**My full list of problematic combinations (and singular cases):**\n\n* Building Offense that gives Defense\n* Tankiness + Gap Closers + Medium/High damage\n* Permanent selfish % Armor/Magic Penetration \n* High Burst + High DPS + Any sort of Defense\n* Gapcloser + CC + High Burst\n* Ranged + Sustain + High DPS + High Burst \n* Ranged + Tankiness + Medium Damage\n* Incorrect Costs for result (Any problematic combination becomes acceptable if there is a correct cost hindering it)\n* Sustain + No cost\n* Multiple Gap Closers + Medium/High Damage + Tankiness/Sustain\n* Tank + High Damage\n* {{summoner:4}} \n\n* CDR + Resource-less\n\n\nTL;DR ^ Those are bad m'kay","replies":[]}
