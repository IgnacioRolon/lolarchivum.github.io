Entertaining, tons and tons of videos and livestreams, and medium learning value.]\n\n* PokerStaples http://www.twitch.tv/pokerstaples [Mildly boring, medium learning. Good tournament source]\n\n* Harrington on Hold'em [book series. Extremely well written, almost a required read for tournaments and poker in general]\n\n* Gripsed http://www.gripsed.com/ [Fairly boring, solidly advanced, very good at mindset and philosophy training.]\n\n* James \"Splitsuit\" Sweeney https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLYzd2pigivfbl2OpYq1Vxg [extremely boring, extremely advanced and in depth. By far the best learning source I've found, but very difficult to get through everything.]","replies":[]}
