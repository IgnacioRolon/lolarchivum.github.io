The heal is fantastic, but it&#039;s INCREDIBLY difficult to pull off by yourself. One slow or hard cc and you&#039;re fucked. It&#039;s best used on the frontline tank standing still.\r\n\r\nHer Parry is fantastic, her Q and E are lackluster.\r\n\r\nVery difficult to play, and the reward is fairly small.\r\n\r\nGreat in lane, bad in late game.
