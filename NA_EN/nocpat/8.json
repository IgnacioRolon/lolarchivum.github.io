They begin spamming significantly when a mistake is made, usually the number 87. When an impressive play is made, I see them focus on the person getting outplayed rather than the person performing the outplay. \r\n\r\nThe spam that I&#039;m aware of usually consists of repeating the same character in a long line, such as 777777777 or 444444 or GGGGGG or that slanted Korean character that looks like an F. \r\n\r\nI most likely am missing something more in the words they are using since I can&#039;t read them. \r\n\r\nI wonder if Asian culture is far more focused on mistakes and humiliation rather than praise for success. With the use of numbers and lack of facial emotes, I feel they are much more cold and calculated rather than emotionally driven. I wonder why the differences are noticable.","replies":[]}
