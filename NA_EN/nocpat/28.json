I don&#039;t see any monetary value in giving someone free stuff.\r\n\r\nSo I ask, are you willing to pay for permanent URF, in some objective manner? I mean YOU specifically, the one reading this. Not the collective player base. If you are not willing to trade Riot something for something, you have no basis for complaint, and are just trying to get what you want for free.\r\n\r\nLet me know if I&#039;m wrong, if you want.","replies":[]}
