COME AND GET HIM\" (I would consider buying the skin for this sole taunt)\r\n\r\n------------- \"Take a long walk through the jungle!\" (says it too happy, wrong tone, and invalidates the far superior 2nd taunt)\r\n-- Don't like the dance [I'd prefer him doing something more stealthy and creepy, as he'll be stealthed while dancing.]\r\n-- Animations keep getting cut off by stealth\r\n- Mask covers cute face and floofyness (same reason I don't like Dino gnar)\r\n- Wilson reference doesn't fit well in my opinion (many people will like it though)\r\n-Laugh not annoying enough [legitimate nerf. Can be fixed by allowing only the come and get him line]\r\n-Not dark enough. Edge is correct, but I want to feel chills when I hear Teemo mumble to himself. Not insanity or jokes, but despair and hollowness.\r\n-Too many references to other media from a character who feels like he has his own past to explore.\r\n------------Beard joke\r\n\r\n(neutral)\r\n=Knife instead of blinding dart.\r\n=Helicopter recall when he says \"reinforcements ain't comin\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOverall: Would not buy.\r\n\r\nRequirements to convince me:\r\n1. Allow spam of the Come and get him taunt by itself\r\n2. Non edgy \"badass buffout while cloaked\" dance\r\n3. Darker lines, less \"light-hearted\" lines.","replies":[]}
