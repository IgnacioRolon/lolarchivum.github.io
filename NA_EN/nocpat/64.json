Overloaded powercreeped kit.\n\n\nEdit due to reveal: What a disappointing ult. It has barely anything to do with time. It's just a blink nuke and a heal, instantly. 3/10 riot, y u do this.\n\nThe E is spot on, perfect for his kit. Passive is alright, leaning towards gameplay rather than design. Q is meh. He needed a ranged poke (of course right? Every champ needs to be able to harass from range and have 2 gap closers and 3 ccs :^))\n\nThat W though. Absolutely incredible. That one gives me a feeling of time manipulation. Great design, great theme, good gameplay, although fairly unviable but who care. As long as it's fun that's perfect.\n\nExtra W passive was powercreep. Stop doing that please.","replies":[]}
