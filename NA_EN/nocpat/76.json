Pretty much Bethesda perks, skills, gunplay, VATS, etc, but Fromsoft style melee combat. Think Dark Souls 2 or Bloodborne for the swordplay and dodging.\r\n\r\nYou start off as a lowly seaman, and work your way up to a mighty Pirate/Sea Captain. Some backstory encourages you to do so. The goal is to conquer the seas and land, build up reputation, and amount a fortune of gold. You&#039;ll fight enemy factions in an effort to control territory.\r\n\r\nYou need to recruit and manage a crew to sail, raid towns, and fight enemy ships at sea. While fighting, you can shout commands and order the crew to do tasks on the ship, as well as do them yourself. \r\n\r\nGold and loot is extremely heavy, so you&#039;ll need to worry about storing it places. Find islands to bury it, and carry chests that you need with you. You lose a fight, you lose your gold on ya, and maybe some of your crew.\r\n\r\nExploring lands will be a solo mission with maybe your first m8 and parrot/dog companion.\r\n\r\n\r\nBethesda, please do this if you want a new IP. \r\n\r\n{{champion:41}}","replies":[]}
