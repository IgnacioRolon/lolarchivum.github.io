I'll briefly explain the conditions, ordering, playstyle etc, to the most effective \"troll\" build I have ever played, and why you should give it a try.\n\nHere's the standard build order:\n{{item:1054}} {{item:2003}} Starting items every time. You want to be able to tank and regen anything thrown at you early and mid game. Shield provides the best protection.\n{{item:2053}} {{item:3751}} I found it to be most efficient to get Raptor Cloak first, and then Cinder right after, and not turn it into Sunfire Cape until very late game. Cinder provides plenty of damage for dueling and pushing purposes. The main advantage of Raptor Cloak first is the gigantic movement speed bonus and the health regen. It'll help chase, run, farm, get back to lane, harass tower, etc. much better.\n{{item:3512}} {{item:3111}} {{item:3075}} After Cinder, try to complete Zz'Rot as fast as possible. The earlier you complete it, the harder it is for your opponent to stop it from pushing. (You'll also get most chances to push and more gold from ZZ'Rot cs) You want Merc's most of the time after it to move at about 550 ms whenever you're near a tower stump and press Q, and to have like 45% cc reduction or whatever the amount is with your W and mastery. Thornmail is to help with pushing, provide more damage, and to allow you to 1v1 adcs with just tank items.\n{{item:3083}} {{item:3065}} {{item:3068}} With Warmog's, Thornmail, ZZ'Rot's and Merc Treads, you should have about 270 armor and 180 MR with about 3500 and gigantic regen. You're good enough here, and this will usually be enough to win you the game. With Spirit Visage, you're at full build at 5.5 items, and are nearly unkillable. Sunfire Cape is just a bonus because you have Cinder already. Bumps your armor to about 350.\n\nSo the Final standard build will be: {{item:3512}} {{item:3111}} {{item:3083}} {{item:3075}} {{item:3065}} {{item:3068}} \n\n-Runes should be AD Red, AD Quints, Armor Yellows, MR Blues. The AD is very important.\n\n-Masteries 9/21/0 getting the %Armor/mr up, and getting as much Armor and MR as possible while skipping the %HP regen path. Garen doesn't stay at low% for long, and he regens extremely fast late game anyway. Focus on maximizing his % MR/Armor bonus. Always get the last hitting helping offense masteries.\n\n-{{summoner:4}} {{summoner:14}} Every time, no exceptions. Teleport is overkill and Garen has far too strong Ignite synergy to not take it, especially with a tank build.\n\nSo why Garen? Let me list off the specifics of Garen that only apply to him + portal.\n\n1. His W's Armor/MR multiplier. He gets the most value out of the double defensives and as a result, has the highest damaging voidlings in the game (with 100% uptime)\n2. His passive allows him to just sit next to the portal and guard it from low HP.\n3. His slow removal, tenacity, Q speed boost, and execute potential allows him to split push at ridiculous times, far out of position and still get away or secure a kill. Qing near a tower stump essentially gives you Homeguard speed.\n4. Sticking a portal in a bush will make them facecheck you! It forces enemies to come into the bush you're waiting in! Garen now has a way to always fight in a bush :^)\n5. He can clear an entire wave in one ability without a resource, and can on hit a tower with Q if needed. This clears the way for voidlings to smack the tower.\n\nOne trick I think I discovered, if you place a pink ward on top of your Zz'Rot portal, the portal itself becomes EXTREMELY difficult to click. If you do it correctly, it essentially increases the portal's life by 5 autoattacks. Take {{item:3362}} on Garen to maximize that.\n\nAs for gameplay, just push, duel, spam taunts, do whatever the heck you want. It doesn't matter if you feed or carry, your job is to annoy the shit out of the enemy team and force them to come after you and deal with your portals. You yourself don't need to splitpush. You just need to secure the portal to splitpush for you. After that you can join teamfights or take their inhibitor, whatever is best. The important thing to do mid/late game, STAY OUT OF POSITION SPLITTING AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. You can run away with a huge chance of success. If they catch you, it'll take them 30+ seconds to deal with you and the portal. That will allow your team to do something else. You essentially just want to waste the enemy team's time all game.\n\nHere's the conditions that I've found for myself in order to win:\n\n* If your team feeds, you will most likely lose.\n* If your team breaks even or ahead, you are almost Garen-teed a win.\n* If you feed it doesn't matter, as long as you get your items on time.\n* You do not need to carry or do well at all to win.\n\nAs such, I have a 2:1 win/loss ratio over 44 games. Every loss and win fell into these conditions correctly. The beauty of this build, is that you can be complete trash mechanically, feed a bunch, but still have a giant impact on the outcome of the game. If your team feeds, expect a loss, because the fed enemies can kill you faster and outpush you. If your enemies are not fed, well, your team is fighting a 6v5 with your portal.\n\nTry it out. I will continue to play it and refine it. I feel it is the easiest freelo I have ever played.","replies":[]}
