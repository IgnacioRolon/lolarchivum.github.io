I get other mastery tokens on different champs but for voli i dont get any, i am aware after you get like a chat restriction or any sort of punishment from riot, you dont acquire them, and i havent gotten any sort of punishment, but i have been getting keys/chest/and other champ mastery tokens just not on voli, any ideas??","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-06-13T17:52:26.428+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's strange you haven't received tokens yet, so I took a look into this for you.  While you are indeed playing ranked, it's for Twisted Treeline.  Per the [champion mastery](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204211284-Champion-Mastery-Guide) guide, currently tokens are awarded through Summoner's Rift for now.  Let me know if that clears things up!","replies":[]}]}
