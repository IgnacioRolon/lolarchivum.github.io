However, I really enjoy league, and its community. I mean, trollers and AFK'ers are a pain, but they really only come once in every 10 games for me. If you got banned, it was probably from something you said in chat, not in game. Rito can't really ban someone for feeding or being bad at the game, but they will ban people for trash talking (which is a shame). Also, League events (at least the largest ones) receive much more income and viewership than Evo. And also consider that Evo is multiple games over multiple days, so it by nature should make more money than a single game on a single day. And lastly, League has a huge loyal community that probably wont die out for another good 10 years.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PentaJuke","date":"2016-05-16T07:20:31.905+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Bye Felicia","replies":[]},{"poster":"QuantumPanther","date":"2016-05-16T04:26:34.393+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"If this is how you speak, I see why you got banned","replies":[]},{"poster":"Best Valor NA","date":"2016-05-16T04:26:21.251+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":5,"body":"200k People watching a league tournament = Nobody. \n\nYou're just salty because you were toxic and got banned or whatever.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dynamiku Entry","date":"2017-02-23T20:46:02.818+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"League has been around for over ten years.

It seems a tad entitled but that is sort of reasonable (its a video game so by definition it should be giving you positive experiences) however I can't seem to figure out why you think its riots fault.\n\nOnline communities in games especially mobas are very bad. Thats just a fact.  But riot has tried to make it better but ultimately the troll has to troll at least once before they get banned.\n\nThe funniest part about this comment is the whole \"real players\" thing.  wtf is a real player? Aren't we all real players?  I can assume you mean competitive and serious about the game (I hope this was aimed at ranked and only ranked) but still if people are having fun and doing their best then they can hardly be blamed for not \"letting you have your day\".","replies":[]}]}
