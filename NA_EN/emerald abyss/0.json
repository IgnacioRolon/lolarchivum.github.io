Well today I was reborn with a new account (I got bored of the Main and wanted to start again).  Today I am here to give my opinion about the new splash art of Demonic Tristana.\r\n\r\nhttps://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/00_T2_Image_ic47eweitcbsinwyn612.jpg\r\n\r\nI have seen the great evolution that the Riot art &amp; music team has had and I have to admit that I am surprised how they have had that breakthrough in art.  To be honest, what I love most about Riot is the team that is in charge of the illustrations.  That way of demonstrating the identity of a character or skin is just amazing and although I'm not a tristana player (I've never liked being Adc, I've always been more of Mid &amp; JG because I love being contributing something to the game) even so this  splash art is among my favorites definitely Jennifer Wuestling is one of the best illustrators and I have to admit that she has some very good knowledge about Graphic Design that she gives them to notice in her works","replies":[{"poster":"Sir Saltarin","date":"2019-05-17T12:59:29.100+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":4,"body":"I actually dont like it","replies":[{"poster":"Emerald Abyss","date":"2019-05-17T13:20:36.542+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"Opinions are like food, there is a wide variety of them and each one has a different taste about them.
