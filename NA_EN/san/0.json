There is method of copying settings, but they are all saved on our server side now.  Meaning, adjusting them once should save it permanently.\n\nIf your bindings are not saving or working though, then the settings could be corrupt.  In that case a config reset should fix it:\n\nLog into the game client.\nNavigate to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config\nDelete the file  named **game.cfg** and **persistedsettings.json**\nGo into a custom game and verify that settings have saved properly.  Leave game to sync settings.","replies":[]}]}
