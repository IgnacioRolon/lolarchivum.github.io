My ping is currently usually around 80, but in the spikes it goes to over 1000. The highest I've seen it was 5000 I think. For the most part the problem is fixed once I disconnect from the game, then reconnect, but that takes about 5 minutes to do and is hurting my team. All other online activities have been normal. I can stream movies fine, and the spikes haven't been occurring when anybody else was using my home's internet. So, I have no idea how to fix it. Any insights anyone? They'd be greatly appreciated!","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-10T04:51:40.241+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Big changes in latency usually indicate there are issues with your network routing to our servers.
