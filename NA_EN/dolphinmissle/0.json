Atleast as far as the player base. Got people saying ww is op with a mere 51% winrate with 125+ games and Kindred is trash when people with 125+ games have 60-70% winrates. People are idiots when it comes to this game.\n\nThis game is fine though. Riot has league in a healthy position and is still the leading monopoly. They aren't going anywhere and I hope they don't. They are doing a fine job.
