Possbly the only Nasus player who has made him work in high elos. \n\nBy making Spirit Fire's Armor reduction % and not Flat you are removing the whole point of this path, and the only viable high elo build, since you are not fixing his atrocious and exploitable early game.\n\nIts a massive Buff for Low elo nasus, and a crippling Nerf for high elo nasus....","replies":[{"poster":"Ravenous Howls","date":"2017-07-19T15:37:37.210+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Quasus style dies with the ZZ'Rot nerf and then with the Doran's Ring passive no longer stacking. 3 early points in E then going Q is the most efficient style now, if you area against a ranged hard counter, otherwise you become irrelevant after 20 minutes. Let's also not forget that E-Max essentially nullified your life steal passive as well.\n\nThis is a buff to the intended style of play for Nasus which is stacking his Q and making sure that damage is relevant against the tanks and other juggernauts he typically faces now a days.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Nea104","date":"2017-07-20T16:41:21.146+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I hope they will finally fix him, instead :)","replies":[]}]}
