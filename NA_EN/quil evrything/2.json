On top of that, they're relatively good indicators of time spent (I know for a fact that I've played over 1,400 Normal matches, and have a winrate at least over 50% overall)\n\n> I've pointed out that there is a very clear reason NOT to keep it.\n\nThe only reason I see is that you seem to misunderstand the argument that Normals are a more relaxed gamemode than Ranked. Here's how things are:\n\nNo matter what gamemode, you are expected to _play to win_. That is the biggest thing that all gamemodes have in common.\n\nRanked is the \"srs bsns\" gamemode, where you're expected (by the community mostly) to be playing at peak performance with every ounce of focus and energy dedicated to winning. It's where you go when you have pretty much everything on lock, and you are absolutely certain that you can reliably win matches with your set-ups.\n\nNormal is the more casual mode, where you're still expected to try and win, but you're not expected to go all out. If you're intentionally not trying to win, you can be punished, but as long as you intend to break the enemy Nexus, you can try out most any set-up you can think of to do that.\n\nRiven Support? Try it out, feel free. Taric Top lane? Why not? Melee ADC w/ Blitz Support? Go for it.\n\nWins and losses don't change the fact that Normals are fairly relaxed, and, as I mentioned, there's _no good reason_ to sacrifice the win/loss counter solely for the sake of hammering home that \"Normals = Relaxed, Ranked = Hardcore\" - particularly because removing the win/loss counter wouldn't hammer that statement home hardly at all.\n\nIt'd be like removing your LP gain/loss counter in Ranked, while still having it in the background. You can't see how well you're doing, but the intention of Ranked is still the same; play hard, and climb. The only difference would be that you can't see how well you're doing until you've moved up or down a tier/division.\n\n> information for informations sake, is not valid.\n\nExcept even the most odd, out-of-place data can still be valid information. Don't discredit the validity of win/loss data just because you think it contributes to some unspoken gravity in Normals.\n\n> there needs to be actual positive value to the information.\n\nDoes there, really?\n\n> particularly when there is a clear negative offset to publicising the information\n\n_What negative?_","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Leylania","date":"2018-03-20T05:21:50.156+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't even remember when was the last time that someone said that normals don't matter.\n\n If you want to play casual (but still not completly int) you go into normals, if you want to tryhard you go ranked..

If you want to practice in a way that will be counter intuitive to winning and you know you will feed like hell then go into a bot game.
