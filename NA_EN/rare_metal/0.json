Increase your ability power by 150% of your bonus attack damage. In addition, your magic damage dealing active abilities can score a critical strike, but you will not be able to steal life through basic attacks. Crystal weapons - best weapons.\n\nQ\n**Rapid destruction**\nYour crystals are as sharp as they go and you can use them as projectiles. Launch a crystal shard in front of you, dealing 50/70/90/110/130 (0.5 ability power) magic damage to first enemy hit. If this ability scores a critical hit, then it will penetrate all enemies in its way and gets 300 bonus range. So sharp.\n(range: 700)\n(cooldown: 6/5/4/3/2 sec)\n(mana cost: 40/45/50/55/60)\n\nW\n**Crystal barrier**\nCrystallize even the air around you and cover yourself with three massive crystals for up to 5 sec. These crystals will reduce damage taken from next 3 direct damage dealing abilities or/and next 3 basic attacks by 20/30/40/50/60 (0.2 ability power). If these crystals are not broken over 5 sec, then they will explode, dealing 35/45/55/65/75 (0.3 ability power) magic damage per not broken crystal to nearby enemies. Moisture and gasses could turn into her weapons.\n(explosion range: 325)\n(cooldown: 20/18/16/14/12 sec)\n(mana cost: 70/75/80/85/90)\n\nE\n**Earthen Maws**\nForce earth in targeted area to crystallize, forming maws, who will slowly close up. Maws will close up over 2 sec, will deal 70/100/130/160/190 (0.8 ability power) magic damage to enemies caught in them and stun them for 1.3/ 1.4/ 1.5/ 1.6/ 1.7 sec. In addition, when you target area, it will shake as maws appear, slowing movement speed of enemies by 45%. Enemies will no longer be slowed when maws closes up. If this ability deals a critical strike to one enemy, then it deals critical strike to all hit enemies. Even the earth is on her side.\n(target range: 900)\n(maw range: 200)\n(cooldown: 18/17/16/15/14 sec)\n(mana cost: 80/84/88/92/96)\n\nR\n**The crystal world**\nCrystals are your world, so turn everything into crystals. As you activate this ability, the terrain around you will turn into crystals for 4 sec. This area is static and will not move together with you. When you hit an enemy, who is within crystallized area, then that enemy will suffer additional 60/80/100 (0.2 ability power) magic damage after 0.75 sec delay and get his/her magic resist reduced by 10% for 3 sec. Magic resist reduction stacks up to 4 times. In addition, you gain 30/40/50% bonus attack speed while you are within crystallized area. Crystals are outrageous.\n(area range: 840)\n(cooldown: 130/115/100 sec)\n(mana cost: 140/150/160)\n\n-\n\n**Builds**\nMage mid: {{item:3020}} {{item:3031}} {{item:3508}} {{item:3087}} {{item:3135}} {{item:3027}} \nAssassin jungle: {{item:3020}} {{item:3031}} {{item:3087}} {{item:3152}} {{item:3116}} {{item:1402}} &lt;- runic echo\nSupport: {{item:3158}} {{item:3092}} {{item:3116}} {{item:3027}} {{item:3030}} {{item:3190}}\nTop: {{item:3020}} {{item:3027}} {{item:3003}} {{item:3004}} {{item:3025}} {{item:3508}} \n\n-\n\n**LORE**\n\nA little girl from Freljord. She traveled trough the world, meeting different people, learning different things. Being only 13 years old, she was already an experienced adventurer. Yet, when she walked through Shurima's deserts, she suddenly disappeared. Gone for 7 years, she reemerged and joined civilization. But not as she was before disappearing.\nShe reemerged with a life stone, ancient power source of the Brackern race. Taking the wisdom, contained in the crystal, its magical energies, combining them with her personal talents, spending nearly 6 years training in solitude, mastering crystal magic, she now walks a world as a different person, not as an adventurer, but as powerful magician.\nAble to do wonders, crystallize earth, water, fire, wind and nearly enemy withing certain range from her, her power proved to be much too great to be ignored.\n\nA several kidnappers were sent to capture her, as she traveled through Valoran, showing off her powers. She was vain and arrogant, but not stupid. As kidnappers move in, she resisted, fought back. During a struggle she managed to defeat nearly everyone, who came after her, but eventually she lost and was captured.\nHer hands were bound, her eyes were sealed. Being naturally beautiful and now captured, nearly helpless, she was violated by her kidnappers, as they were taking her back to her home land - Freljord.\n\nHer powers lied withing her right hand, as it was fused with a life stone. One night, when she couldn't take more abuse, she got a chance to escape, but for a great cost. Her hands were bound in special shackles, preventing her form doing nearly anything. She was held in a shack, full with old farming tools, so, she found a scythe, rammed it into a wall and cut her hands off.\nAfter this gruesome ordeal, she managed to pull out a life stone, crystallized her wounds and built new arms from crystals. That night, she got her revenge, but that wasn't enough. Someone sent these kidnappers after her and she is determined to find who was behind it.\n\n**\"Crystals used to sing for me, their melodies had echoed through my soul, my mind. They were beautiful, colorful, radiating with joy, shinning in the darkness. But now, they are as cold as my homeland, screaming with pain and horror. They demand revenge as i fuel them with my lust for blood. Someone took away my light from me, leaving only a frozen heart.  To melt it down, i will take their hearts. Soon, they will learn how sharp my crystals are.\"** - Mada.\n\nReview: http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/MkG6MKpE-umbrara-resurrected-plague?comment=0004","replies":[{"poster":"ninjaIRL ","date":"2016-05-09T08:31:00.513+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":2,"body":"Nice boobs- I mean champion concept.","replies":[{"poster":"Rare metal","date":"2016-05-09T08:48:16.367+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"C'mon.","replies":[{"poster":"Fritterz","date":"2016-05-09T16:48:36.888+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Rare metal,realm=EUNE,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=rAHJ5y6i,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2016-05-09T08:48:16.367+0000)\n>\n> Cumon.\n\nFTFY","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"VasilisGreen","date":"2016-05-09T16:51:26.335+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's all about the boobs","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BowieTheNifty","date":"2016-05-09T09:10:35.008+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alright so let me break down a little review for you here. Sense this is fresh and it looks like time has been put into it, I will give some feed back immediately. Without further adu lets go over this kit.\n\nPassive - Crystals of might\nSo while a stat conversion is fine and all to have as a passive, I believe the scaling for this one is a bit too much. Even with it being bonus attack damage you are still getting more ability power out of attack damage items then you would from buying AP items. Now this is after running comparisons to the major AP items verses the recommended items on your build here. Anyways what I suggest is that you lower this scaling. Maybe do 200% of bonus attack damage max. Abilities being able to crit I am completely fine with. Now the question I want to bring up is more of a concern about it. When an ability crits will it deal double damage or perhaps be a reduced critical hit?\n\nQ -  Rapid destruction\nSo the passive on this ability appears to be another stat conversion. This time however I don't see why this is even on the ability. Not only do you not really get a benefit from it, the numbers come out a bit weird. In the case of buying a statikk shiv, well you get 3.5% cool down reduction. Honestly I would remove the passive from this as it feels tacked on. \nFor the active on this ability, I really like it. Having an ability like this is really cool. On a crit it will pierce targets and I will admit it is a nice touch. It shows how much of a power spike she gets from having an ability crit. Don't worry about changing anything on this one.\n\nW - Crystal barrier\nNow this active is pretty neat. It is a defensive ability that isn't your standard shield that blocks damage. Instead it reduces damage from a certain amount of attacks, single targets abilities, or skill shots. At least those are what I believe it blocks, am I right on that? I do hope these work against large minions and monsters. Either way it is a unique ability that I enjoy seeing. \n\nE - Earthen Maws\nOnce again this isn't bad. Though I will admit it does seemed really similar to a certain ability already within the league. I am talking about Swains root, except this one far out classes it. Not only is it a slowing field but it can stun targets and critically strike for massive damage in a small AoE. While it isn't bad in concept, I do have concerns about this ability as it might be a bit over powering even with the delay on the maw. \n\nR - The crystal world\nThis ultimate I have one simple word to describe it, Overloaded. You have an area of effect that grants allies bonus armor, reduces enemies magic resist, cause Mada to gain bonus magic damage on her basic attacks, as well Mada will heal on critical basic attacks. This does so many things at once that it lacks a defining characteristic. Which is kind of a disappointment. In my eyes I can see this girl as a selfish type of character. So why not have this ult reflect that? Instead of her granting bonuses she can gain some complimentary buffs. Like she would be able to shred magic resist with her attacks while in the area. Or you can have something happen to enemies around her upon activation.  There are so many things you could have this ultimate do in this situation, keep it focused with a goal in mind. What is the general goal that Mada would want to accomplish with this ultimate? Sometimes it is a good idea to question yourself on whether something is good and healthy, especially when it comes to design. Guess this is why a lot of concept creators ask for feedback all the time, myself included. Then it takes another person to see the little bits of unhealthy parts of a concept like this. \n\nFor the kit in general you have some good things here. Then again some things I believe are needing a change simply due to either numbers or just in mechanics. Mainly this is to help you refine the character or even future kits when designing. It isn't to put you down by any means, so don't take it to heart. Anyways hopefully this helped you in some way. If you wish to look at some concepts for maybe some insight or just because you are curious, then feel free to look at my lastly concept, [Raseri, The Living Conduit](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/nmMabZpE-champion-concept-raseri-the-living-conduit)","replies":[]},{"poster":"kJs","date":"2016-05-09T09:08:51.105+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't see a common theme here. \nSeems like a bunch of roles and champions mushed into one.\n\nShe's going to be really powerful with that much free AP from AD.\n\nHer kit is overloaded with a bunch of free stats and no interesting ability mechanics.\n____\nI get that you are trying to make someone who can both build AP and AD but she's going to end up with a lot of free AP from building heavy AD items.

Simply dealing damage to more enemies without changing the spell in any other way seems kind of boring.  It also doesn't change the behavior of neither the player nor her enemies.  The ult zone increasing attack speed seems like it only helps if the player is already building critical strike.  Seems like she should gain an increase to her crit chance while in the zone, no?\n\nIn addition, it would be nice if the player could find some consistency to these special crit effects, sort of like Karma's Mantra'd abilities.  What if the Crystal Shield ability caused her next ability to guarantee a crit?  Each crystal that she spawns (up to 3) could act as a charge that is consumed when she uses her Q or E.  Now the player has some choice about whether or not to stay back and protect her crystals so she can get guaranteed crits, or  consume them as a sort of isolated series of spell shields.  This also gives the enemy team the opportunity to jump on her and remove her shields before she has a chance to abuse her crit powers.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Wandering F B","date":"2016-05-09T21:46:38.870+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:44}} :\"im your father and Mada is your sister.\"\n{{champion:72}} :\"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!\"","replies":[{"poster":"Rare metal","date":"2016-05-10T08:16:01.954+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{item:3070}} have new meaning to it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Hildebrand","date":"2016-05-09T14:21:52.036+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like the Q, I think that the way Riot has been playing with CDR and Crit in alternative ways has really brought some life back into the Mage/ADC builds.

Additionally, if the seed grows within your ult area, it will stun for half the duration of the vision.\n\nR- Passively, it gives CDR for building Crit and vice versa, (at like 25%.)

It serve its purpose, but doesn't add anything more, than more built paths. Pretty boring, if you ask me. It is functional, but doesn't any gameplay elements to works around or against.\n\n**Q.** Again, functional. Penetration and extra range is good addition, if you built crit. But, same problem as with passive - feels boring. You pretty much spam it and hope for critical strikes.\n\n**W.** As someone mentioned bellow, allowing you to personally reactivate it and dealing damage when you want, would be much better, than just wait until it will explode on its own. Now, blocking certain amount of damage - you don't see this every day. Like the idea behind it. It scales pretty well early, but, unfortunately, falls off late game. With your current numbers, late game damage reduction against ADC or AP carry enemies wouldn't even matter. Sorry.\n\n**E.** In my imagination, it would look awesome. This one adds more gameplay elements and i would consider the most fun ability in your kit. Placing it at the right place, trying to get as many enemies hit as possible, because many targets = bigger chance to crit. I like this one, i like it a lot. But i would suggest to improve the power of this ability, because any enemy with decent mobility can move out of the area, 2 sec is a lot of time and damage isn't that special, only stun is quite strong.\n\n**R.** Meh. Huge damage steroid, when fighting enemy with no CC. R+Q+AA+Q+AA = profit. Additional reason why your champion should build AD. To tell you the truth, i don't see any reason for your champion to build AP. Even with bonus effects from AP items, you would benefit so much more from AD builds, because of this ability and passive.\n\n**Overall.** I am not impressed. While your champion is functional and could easily fit into the game, i don't see anything really fun about it. Your champion is just too simple and meh. Nothing to play around, nothing to play against. This would be very good champion about 3 years ago, but now riot tries to make complex, yet fun and innovative champions (except failures like {{champion:157}} {{champion:104}} {{champion:420}} and so on).

( the AD given is basically a free BF sword)\n- nashors gives atk speed and Extra AP on hit\n-Yes these items are ment for hybrid but the items themselves cater to different groups of champs/people, Guinsoo go for AD atk Champs and Nashors for AP champs( like Diana and Fizz).\n-Infinity Edge and Statikk are two STRONG AD power spike items and having the IE (possibly) work on her passive is way too strong.\n\nTd;lr- Two many Tears in top lane takes too long to stack.\n\nMy fav build on her would either be the support build or the TOP build though. (You don't need both Manamune and Archangle staff since that requires you to stack two tears which takes along time) \nI would have her build path cater towards either her passive (since it is pretty cool) or to her kit itself. (Like give more incentive for building her AP).\n\nBecause me personally, I would go full AP on her and just use her passive to farm or poke. .3.","replies":[{"poster":"Rare metal","date":"2016-05-10T14:21:57.441+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Build depend on what you want to do.\nI would want to deal massive damage, so i would build mid-lane build, but if i got to support someone, then i would use support build.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Delphinium","date":"2016-05-09T19:19:35.197+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Reminded me of that girl from Frozen","replies":[{"poster":"Choaru","date":"2016-05-10T13:04:20.518+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The picture itself is a picture of Elsa that is why :)\nThat title of the picture was likeEvil Queen Elsa I believe.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"WiegrafOfValor","date":"2016-05-10T12:25:06.229+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Go home Elsa, we already have our Crystal Queen!!\n\n{{champion:44}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cheese Pope","date":"2016-05-09T21:06:48.368+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They changed the roles up, you might want to fix the roles for your champion\nhttp://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/gameplay/dev-blog-classes-subclasses\n\nBtw nice concept ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)","replies":[{"poster":"Rare metal","date":"2016-05-09T21:26:54.370+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What is this?","replies":[{"poster":"Cheese Pope","date":"2016-05-09T21:34:44.947+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is how they categorize champions now","replies":[{"poster":"Rare metal","date":"2016-05-10T08:14:46.771+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Looks strange.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Nautricity","date":"2016-05-09T22:18:01.264+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Artwork is By Zeronis for anyone wondering,\nit's a representation of Elsa.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GaleWinUnleashed","date":"2016-05-09T20:18:49.335+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really like the way you worked crit into this kit.
