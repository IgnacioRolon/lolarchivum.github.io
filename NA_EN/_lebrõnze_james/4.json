I don&#039;t even see the point in trying to even help them with anything. \r\n\r\n1. They don&#039;t listen to pings\r\n2. They don&#039;t accept any advice\r\n3. All they do is feed then find someone to blame for their feeding.\r\n4. If one person afks the whole team suffers and loses league points.\r\n5. It&#039;s the hardest thing in the world to try to get people to group in soloque.\r\n\r\nWhy can anyone call this a team game....the only teamwork I see only exists on the enemy team.","replies":[]}
