I might have worded my comment wrong as I agree with you that people with overall bad internet shouldn't play online games, but people who have most of the time a good/acceptable connection. Then one game they just happen to have a bad connection ofr the match. Or what about people who happen to have some other problem with their computer. As those problems can be unpredictable aswell.\n\nI should add to this that punishing the other player on the duo would be unfair in my opinion as if the other memeber of the duo HAS to go (He will get punished and deserves it), but the other person can play normally. Why should then the other person get punished.\n\nOverall i don't think we can improve the system. Maybe we could decreas the lp loss, but not take it away completely. So 20 lp loss would be 10 lp loss. While increasing the afkers lp loss from 20 to 30.

But then again it could be something simple as someone just getting tired and angry at the game and choosing to simply just stand up and go grab a drink or food. So what i guess i am trying to say is it is hard on riots end to really narrow all of these things down to be able to punish someone who is afk. \n\nFor instance lets say for some strange reason your i dont know mother has a stroke and you have to help her and drop everything you are doing. Then no you should not have to be punished for that but then again how can anyone know what truly happened and now everyone on the team is getting less of a punishment and that person is getting a greater punishment for something that is totally out of their control. \n\nI feel like if you physically close your client or hit the exit button then sure get the punishment because you are the one physically responsible for leaving the game.

The grading system could easily be done to adjust LP gains and losses on both sides with an S being like 15% increase and C or D being extra LP lost whether through a win or loss. That way players were being dead weight don't get the full value of the win and leech and are forced to climb while players who consistently show that they are doing well despite people tanking could climb easier. Another system could be the honor system which ended up failing for the most part. That easily could have acted as a way to get people removed the Ranked pool easier as say, Honor 5 reports someone for rage quit, that person will be flagged faster as they were reported from such a high Honor level.

What's the point? The two should be following each other regardless, but even pretending it's fair for one and not the other is ridiculous. The fact there are two systems is bogus in the first place. You shouldn't ever be publicly ranked better or worse than you are matched up as. That's just dumb in the first place.\n\nHowever, aside from that, leavers aren't supposed to be something to feel better about. I'm not supposed to have a goal of making other teammates' lives unbearable to the point that I may force one to leave and alleviate my loss burden some, just be sure not to cross the toxic line. I'm also not supposed to be boosting the records of early-game champions, who likely get more players to ragequit against them than enemies get your allies to ragequit, and thus have a higher favorable 10 LP vs -3 LP tradeoff. That's not supposed to be considered in this game. Your goal is to win the game more than you lose, and since 100% attendance is not an attainable goal, ever, you need to simply live with a vanilla form of endgame distribution. Other forms of distribution *are* able to be abused, and result in other negative game impacts, including increased leaver amounts.\n\nJust do what you can to make sure you aren't encouraging leavers, and you'll get plenty of leavers on the other team to offset the ones you get.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Saezio","date":"2019-11-04T23:15:40.833+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can't have one team winning normal LP and the other losing less LP.\n\nYou either make the AFKER lose the entirety of the LP the winning team won (minus the 12 that his team lost) or you create LP out of nothing which fucks up the entire balance behind the ladder","replies":[]},{"poster":"rawiazam1","date":"2019-11-04T22:08:28.617+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i like how i made the EXACT SAME POST a year ago and god alot of slack for it.\n\nhypocrites and sheeps gonna hyprocrite and sheep","replies":[]},{"poster":"inwhomane","date":"2019-11-04T21:33:55.371+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"whats the point riot wont ever fix their shitty reporting system. theyll litterally just ignore this post regardless of how many likes it gets. because they dont care.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Teémò","date":"2019-11-04T21:26:55.979+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If  people refuse to surrender, but your the carry and their like 0/15 no he just doesn't want to waste time when he knows he can get the lp back the next game.

And in that match the team lost then i think the players that cause no offence should receive either all or some LP back that they lost. And if the player happens to be in promo during the verdict then he receives Blue Essence.","replies":[]}]}
