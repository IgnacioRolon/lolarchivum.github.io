NEVER. When this patch updated I'm starting to have it. Lag spike happens like every 10 secs which mess me up at bad moments like mis-timing my flash, skillshot delayed, etc. It really ruins my gameplay... Don't think my internet have problems. When I play other online games, no lag spikes. Is there anything I can do to fix this? I did use the \"repair\" tool that the client offers and it did not work.\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"KÃ¼rama","date":"2016-07-30T09:49:39.607+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"[Troubleshoot your lag spikes.](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues)\n\nhttp://na.leagueoflegends.com/sites/default/files/styles/scale_xlarge/public/upload/su16_keyart_1920x1080_0.jpg?itok=6nj8mHjj","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-30T16:44:28.497+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Infrequent lag spikes like this can be due to your network suffering from packet loss, which can be a result of  your routing or some instability.
