Like say I command my champion to go into the grass, delayed for like a sec before it enters there. Don't think my internet got problems, its 25 ms. At first I thought my mouse right button just having problems but doesn't seem like the issues since I don't have that problem in other things outside of League while my skillshots also delayed before firing it. Not sure what's the real problem here... my fps also seems fine. Got any idea what causes these command delays? Hope you get the idea on what I'm talking about.  Any support is appreciate.\n\nEDIT: Ok, I found out that it is pocket loss issue. I fix this issue before simply by stop using wireless and just go with Ethernet. This time... I don't know how to fix it. My old way doesn't work anymore. The logs that got problems is \"2016-04-05T00-04-23_netlog\"(Not sure if that was useful). The rest is fine.
