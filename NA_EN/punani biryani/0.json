Let me also point out that i was ADC and my support was volibear with NO support items NO wards he had exhaust and heal just to put you in context of the kind of player i had to spend my game DUO laning with (oh and he also was taking cs). He started running towards kalista at level 1 while we couldn&#039;t outtrade them especially with their minion wave and he died started blaming me for not following up and i got instantly angry at him cause the lane was basically over at 2 minutes with kali double kills. That anger snowballed during the entire game and he kept calling me a retard and i lost my temper and broke the summoners code. I ADMIT TO ALL THIS. But I got perma banned simply cause he was playing with his friends and they all decided to troll report me together I didn&#039;t even get chat restrictions i didn&#039;t even get 2 weeks suspension i got PERMA banned i&#039;m only level 26 WTF seriously.\n\n THE WORST PART IS: i clicked play again after game recap and played a game he was on the other team this time it took 10 minutes for their adc to ask us to report him as well BECAUSE HE WAS A TROLL you can check in the match history of the reported volibear and if Riot seriously expects us to keep our cool when you have to duo lane with a troll you are dellusional.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Tantram","date":"2016-03-10T19:39:47.160+0000","up_votes":32,"down_votes":3,"body":"> Perma banned without chat restrictions without 2 weeks first\n\nYou've actually had a 10-game chat restriction, a 25-game chat restriction, and a 14-day ban ban before your perma-ban.","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-03-10T19:41:01.232+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":2,"body":"God damn I love you can check on that, and do!","replies":[{"poster":"RottedApples","date":"2016-03-12T02:51:29.208+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"when did nami get a blue name https://media.giphy.com/media/LDyl6dzOr6Njy/giphy.gif","replies":[]},{"poster":"a salty chocobo","date":"2016-03-11T08:58:11.522+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Deep Terror Nami,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=VeWAuvvf,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2016-03-10T19:41:01.232+0000)\n>\n> God damn I love you can check on that, and do!\n\nToxic.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"yuong god","date":"2016-03-10T19:47:08.239+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"wow, you must have been really toxic to be banned before level 30","replies":[]},{"poster":"Karlyr","date":"2016-03-10T19:43:05.109+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Man that was quick.
