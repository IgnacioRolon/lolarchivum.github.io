Since this is the first time you guys released a chroma with a new skin, does this mean that Xin is going to get a big buff or something? Or is it an item that is getting buffed  {{item:3124}} {{item:3153}} ? He is going to get a rework soon so it doesn't make sense if you guys don't do any changes for him. Why make a skin for a champ that no one barely plays? Might as well just make a skin for {{champion:104}} {{champion:55}} {{champion:92}} {{champion:13}} {{champion:110}} or {{champion:164}} \nSo with these facts, does it mean that Xin is going to be in meta again?
