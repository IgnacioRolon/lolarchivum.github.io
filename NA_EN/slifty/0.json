I'm hoping that we can see some responses from rioters as well since they are the ones that can play the leadership role here.\n\nIn particular I want to talk about:\n\n1. Skins and champion body types.\n\n2. Gender diversity (or lack thereof) in the pro gamer scene.\n\n3. Appropriate reactions to misogynistic comments and language in-game (and even more subtle stuff that you might not thwap a full blown \"misogynistic\" label onto but would still make women disproportionately less comfortable than men).\n\n4.

We just want to play games we like without our genders being big deals. \n\n\nI think it's a conversation and solution that has to be met by both genders, because yes, there are girls who could care less about games but play or stream because it's easy attention. But they wouldn't succeed in doing so if guys stopped giving those girls attention.\n\nIf you're a serious female gamer and you actually want to stream or cast about a game you love, once again, you are cornered.\n\n> A) You are either attractive and get called an attention whore, and your opinions are ultimately dismissed BECAUSE TITS, PLZ STRIP, LOL white knight legion. \n\n> B) You are not attractive and people do nothing but call you fat, ugly, still an attention whore and your opinions are ultimately dismissed. \n\nMore in relation to league - I have been playing video games and online games for a LONG time. I've never encountered the sort of harassment and harsh treatment in other games as I have within LoL's community. \n\nWhen we try to voice our opinions about the state of female representation in LoL, we're immediately dismissed as whiny feminist whore bitches who are trying to ruin everything. When in reality, MOST of us are just trying to say \"Hey, you know, we're here, we play, and maybe the issue isn't that our population is small so we can be ignored but rather our population is small BECAUSE we are ignored.\"\n\nNot everybody can have the backbone to stick up for ourselves when LITERALLY THOUSANDS of angry / immature guys are throwing the worst of the worst at us because for whatever reason they think less battle bikinis and strip tease recall animations is encroaching on their rights, or something.\n\nTake this thread from reddit where I told someone off for making fun of chubby cosplayers:\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/uGfF4oL.png\n\nWhich leads into my last point - objectifying and sexualizing female game characters has real-world consequences. Every time I see a gorgeous girl post a cosplay pic and either get ripped apart because she is not a size 0, or already skinny girls photoshopping their bodies to hell so that they can look good enough for global acceptance by the male gaze, it breaks my heart. \n\nHaving characters who are (at times) obscenely mis-proportioned, or at-best cookie-cutter clones of a busty, thin-waisted, booty-licious diva just reinforces the idea that a female's worth starts with her looks, and not her abilities. These are supposed to be heroes and legends, but very few human females in this game are anything but model - worthy. Nobody is average. Nobody is scrawny and flat-chested. Nobody is a little chubby. \n\nEverybody however has an option to show some T&A, though. \n\nThere needs to be a MAJOR mentality swap from current gamers before anything can move forward. \n\nIt can start by stopping the treatment of female gamers are evil or goddesses, or whatever. We're just gamers, and we have a right to have concerns about the media we enjoy.

In fact, I posted a thread on reddit a few weeks back where I photoshopped miss fortune's body to look a little better (by my opinion anyway) and I did defend that I felt a lot of the character's being sexy and provocative fit. Also, some of them being skinny (namely, morgana) also fit with their personalities. \n\nThe issue is that while the males are still idealized, they are done so with a little more variety. We have male characters who are slender (Ez, Shen), toned (Talon, Draven), and built (Trynd, Garen) - all of these body types could be considered attractive and ideal depending on who you ask.  We have one who is totally fat, perhaps as a joke, and some guys who are ridiculous walking biceps (Olaf. Heavens!).\n\nThere are other body types to females that are attractive without having to have a huge chest and bomb-shell curves. Riot certainly achieves this a little bit with characters like Sivir and Sejuani who are both clearly toned, vs say, Ahri who is a softer sort of sexy. But these deviations are slight and noticeable mostly when you're really paying attention. All of them have huge, pronounced chests, for instance. Someone like Vi I would imagine might have a smaller chest, but her boobs are just as boob-tastic as the rest. (this is of course applying only to humanoid characters - I don't count yordles and anamorphic). \n\nI don't mind them all being attractive - I just think there needs to be a little more creativity to their design instead of defaulting to big-boobs-small-waist-wide-hips, and I'd argue Riot has actually taken some steps towards getting better at this (Diana was a shining example. She is still part of this mold but many of her other features deviated from traditional beauty making her unique and striking). \n\n\nI hope that is clearer?

If you have any doubts about this, then ask why Chun-Li or Kiera Knightly are lusted after by so many men.  Ask why porn sites like Abby Winters and Suicide Girls that specifically featured \"normal girls\" of various shapes and figures exploded in size when they first came out.  Ask why so many men enjoy watching women's beach volleyball.\n\nSo pinning the homogenous shape of women on what men find attractive, really, doesn't hold up that well.  If nothing else, only making that shape of women under that logic is alienating the market of men who like tomboys, slim ladies, fit looking ladies and/or furries, and to make good on this lack, they'd have to diversify their female champions post-haste.\n\nIn the end, though, that doesn't matter, because the male gaze shouldn't be the only reason female champions exist.  I say this as a straight man who bought the Headmistress Fiora skin in significant part because he finds headmistress Fiora smoking hot.  (Also because the red scarf looks dynamic billowing behind the black pantsuit)  The main reason female champions should exist is because roughly half the population of the world is female, and they should be represented too.\n\nNote:  Half the population is not made up of scantily clad women with the figure of a pinup model.

You are right in saying that there are no \"bad\" looking girls (though that is a matter of opinion, because attraction is subjective.)

It didn't fit her character.  It didn't fit the costume.  It was ill-placed gratuity.  In short, I would argue it was bad for the game.  I'll grant her present animation is also sub-par, but I never read anyone compliment the original recall based on its animation quality.  The vast majority of voices I read supporting it supported it because they were titillated, and they were upset that got taken away.  It's replacement being bad didn't help matters, though.  If it had been changed to one where she cosied up to the pole, then, subverting expectations, sliced it apart with a laugh and a threat, there would probably have been fewer complaints.

I can see MF doing it.  I can see Ahri teasing similarly, if not with a pole dance.  Katarina, though, I see her as far more likely to stab you than strip for you, and I think that's okay.  Having a handful of women in a game that make you think, \"Yeah, I can see her deciding to do an impromptu striptease\" is plenty, and there should be room for women who wouldn't to not be given the animation for no good reason at all.  If absolutely nothing else, it dilutes their character.\n\nMore problematically, though, it sends a negative message.

This basically made me hate ever playing because they'd just troll me constantly about \"being bad because\" I was female, and could never amount to anything skill-wise in a video game because of it.\n\nWhen I got into playing ranked (currently gold in s3),acquaintances who knew little of my play-style saw that I had reached gold started asking who carried me, when I played in solo queue or duo'd with friends across rank levels (bronze to plat). This was all pretty insulting. \n\n**Pedestal**: Then when I played an MMO, I experienced the other side of the extreme gender treatment, where people were amazed that a female gamer could take top server stats in pvp scenarios and often seemed to worship me (I didn't seek this out, I didn't over-sexualize my avatars or names, I wanted to measure myself against other players without gender being a factor).\n\n**Positive take from the troll**: The fact that this guy trolling your post immediately jumps to calling you legbeard feminist is just sad, though I suppose we can draw one positive from the misguided rage: What are the positive interactions female gamers are having with male gamers (with less focus on white-knighting)? How can these interactions be encouraged in others?\n\nAs Rioters have noted, contrary to the troll's opinion, racist and homophobic comments are the most banned in the tribunal.

I'll see in the morning!]\n\nThis is a good observation. Riot stands as an example of a gaming company that combats toxicity and serves its players' wants, and could easily also represent a FUNCTIONAL effort to investigate how to welcome female gamers more effectively than other games have done in the past.\n\nIf Riot's research and efforts could make that sort of impact on the gaming community at large, they'd set a very unique and powerful benchmark.\n\nThere are a few visible issues, and surely a number of unseen or indirect issues that may contribute to why there are fewer female Summoners, and virtually no females at the pro levels:\n\n\ni) Generally yes, males will be more competitive and driven by overt competition with others more so than females. It's how the genders have typically been socialized. Sadly, females are also often socialized to feel valuable if they are appreciated by males, which is often easily attained at lower skill levels in games. I'm a female gamer myself, and it is always frustrating when another female is brought in by fellow (male) gamers, giggling and flirting and talking about how she bought the most naked skin possible. She can do terrible, pout about it, and have the guys crawling to give her attention and tell her she's \"really good\" (even while the guys and the girl know it's not true, the desired attention was achieved).\n\n\nThen there is another experience for female gamers:\n\n\nii) Stereotyping and resulting interactions; how these negative interactions (intentional or not) affect female gamers' self-perceptions and game play. Stereotype threat (for an overview: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotype_threat) likely affects a number of female gamers. Research on stereotype threat has shown in other areas that when a certain group is expected to perform poorly, that group does perform at lower levels than they would if negative expectations weren't held. Also relevant to performance, social expectations bias decision-making in uncertain inter-personal situations (which occur frequently within a LoL match; example reference: http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0015762). Considering even just these possible factors creates a disadvantage for the general female gaming population when it comes to how they are likely to perform in-game(there are always exceptions).\n\nFemale gamers do not even have to reveal their sex to be affected by these things. Someone could make a bad decision, and the resulting dialogue could be like:\n\nPlayer 1: \"Get back in the kitchen, baddie\"\nPlayer 2: \"Calm your tits, it was one mistake\"\nPlayer 1: \"Chill, put a tampon in\"\n\nAnd the female gamer doesn't even have to be involved in that exchange to be affected because the stereotypical message has been delivered: \"Females are bad at video games and don't belong.\"\n\nWhen I started playing League, I was regularly told by the male friends I joined up with (including my boyfriend at the time) that I'd just be bad because I was a \"girl,\" constantly told \"It's okay you're just a girl.\" I quit for many months because it was NOT fun regularly being told that I could never be any good at the game because of my sex.\n\n\nAnd third:\n\n\niii) Do we really know what female gamers want from their gaming experience? As an example, research in other game styles (e.g. MMORPG) suggest that women prefer social experiences, even beyond what males do. That seems to make sense based on how the genders are socialized (EXAMPLE LINK IN FOLLOWING COMMENT). But discovering what female gamers actually want from a MOBA would be fascinating. Other companies (beyond just gaming) tend to throw pink at women, or obvious efforts to play up the things women stereotypically should want and enjoy, without exceptional success BECAUSE it is so overt and without proper research background.\n\n\n\nGoing to go pass out now, but I think it'd be fascinating and worthwhile to explore these issues and their related factors within the MOBA setting.","replies":[{"poster":"Doomsie","date":"2013-09-18T15:26:50.670+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I ran out of space to add a reference, so here it is in regard to the \"Do we really know what female gamers want from their gaming experience?\" section:\n\n\n\"Sex Differences and Similarities in Video Game\nExperience, Preferences, and Self-Efficacy: Implications\nfor the Gaming Industry\" by Terlecki et al. in 2011.\n\nThis article is an excellent read to explore why males and females play certain types of games more, how they play, what motivates them, etc. I wish I could provide a link to a free read of it, look it up on your school database search.

Leona and Quinn both show a much more varied type of body types with full body armor and reasonable proportions when compared to Miss Fortune or Morgana. Vi is also great because of both her attitude and aesthetic appeal and her lack of sexual focus. \n\n2. Not to take away from the specific topic but I think this is a much bigger problem in the video game industry as a whole.

While I'm certainly no advocate of misogynistic comments and sexually based discrimination, I don't honestly think this is a problem that can be handled like others. Do people do this sort of thing all the time? Absolutely. Does it come up a lot and is it generally accepted by a large amount of people? I don't think there's a single way to deny that. However, I believe that's just a side effect of both anonymity and the global presence that the Internet brings. No matter where you go on the internet, you will always find hateful, spiteful comments about one thing or another. Women seem to specifically be the target in video games, League being no exception, due to the \"boys only club\" mentality that is just found in this hobby. \nI don't think raging leading to negative attitudes or frustrated cussing is inherently a bad thing. I think the problem is that people often focus their frustration at a specific target, many times often a teammate. This is a problem but other than simply eliminating the use of a large amount of curse words, this can't be curbed in a humongous way. That being said, Lyte's posts and adjustments to bans, warnings and the Tribunal seem to be doing very well in curbing this sort of behavior and attitude.

Healthcare is atrocious in Ethiopia, therefore we will not try to improve our system here.\n\nI usually avoid gender-related topics on the internet when I see that there is no potential for actual changes; the discussions usually end with really angry people who are more set in their ways than before they entered the threads. Why I bothered to bring my academic and personal experiences to *this* discussion?\n\n1) Because Riot is a company who is legitimately player-focused with Rioters interested in what we have to say. They have research teams who give concrete definitions to formerly ambiguous and “unsolvable” issues, and explore how to attenuate those problems for the community. If any discussion on gender in gaming culture was to make an impact on the Internet, it would be here, with Riot’s beta community.\n\n2) As a gamer who is female, it has been interesting to see other gamers-who-are-female express their experiences and ideas in intelligent and composed manners.

That’s awesome.\n\n3) There is possibility for change. When more people say that something is not socially acceptable, those norms eventually weigh on people, not all people, but norms *are* powerful. They just need to be visibly supported. There will always be bigotry, misogyny, and so forth, but if THIS community upholds the norms that say that these things are not welcome in this community, *behavior* stemming from these things will be attenuated. Even if some people remain bigoted/misogynistic/etc, any reduction in the related behavior (e.g. due to the consequences of norms violations) is progress. When you add research tools, such as those utilized by the Player Behavior & Justice (PB&J) team Dr. Lyte heads, other means of adjusting behaviors may be uncovered, too.\n\nThere will always be differences, just as you and I have differences in perspective about whether or not there is the possibility for change. There will be dicks everywhere, but there are a lot fewer of them who say women shouldn’t have the right to vote or call black people the N word. Those changes didn't happen because people did nothing about the issues. As this isn’t nearly as a systemic issue as the aforementioned were in their times, it seems an even easier task, then, to call for a shift in gender-related changes in the gaming culture. Or even just in League’s gaming culture.\n\nIf change is to happen, it has to start somewhere, even if it’s just in a discussion amid gamers on Riot’s beta forum.\n\nIn a tangent, I understand the concepts of perseverance in the face of adversity, beyond gender topics. I was born to a poor family who literally asked me why I wanted to go to college, how that would serve Jesus, etc. I went to school full-time while working full-time, all the while with a family that, for a long time, offered little support and plenty of Bible verses. I now have a master’s degree. I get “soldiering on regardless,” and do so in various aspects of my life as anyone does.\nThe social norms around gender in gaming are created, and therefore can be adjusted with effort over time, which I choose to do in the places I perceive as positive and beneficial (which I explained above already).","replies":[{"poster":"tehdef","date":"2013-09-19T16:28:01.708+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I get where you are going, but I still don't believe things will change. We haven't even removed racism fully in REAL LIFE. Why do you think the internet, where everyone can hide behind a veil of anonymity would be ANY different? Because punishments? LoL's community forums won't change gaming. \n\nKnow what is going to change gaming? When TSM, or Cloud 9, or another pro team include a girl who is GREAT. That's what will have an impact on gaming. When people see first hand that girls can be great. Right now, there is no one. So you go find that person, you find a team that will house them, and then we can go back to 1 side of this discussion.\n\nI still feel like feminism in gaming comes down to more than 1 thing, and it's not just an objective concern, but subjective as well. \n\n- Less \"sexy\" characters\n- More respect \n\nCan agree with respect, not with character design decisions. \n\nThere are also people hurting your image when they pop onto a stream, and whip out the push up bra and wear a low cut shirt that makes nobody take girls seriously except for their looks. You know, those dudes that donate HUNDREDS of dollars at a time, they don't help either. What is this, myfreecams.com? \n\nSociety isn't going to change. In fact, I would rather sexuality be embraced more than violence and hatred. So lets kill the lack of respect, and keep the boobs.","replies":[{"poster":"Doomsie","date":"2013-09-19T17:07:25.712+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"We have already established that we differ in opinion about whether or not change is possible. We haven’t REMOVED racism, but I didn’t say “remove” an issue, I said “attenuate.” Attenuation still equates to change. I also didn’t say “Because punishments” as you did, I said because if the **social norms** declare that misogyny is not acceptable, then negative associated behaviors become **attenuated** with time.\n\nJust saying that nothing can change and not investigating whether or not that statement is true with legitimate effort and research is very defeatist. \n\nA pro-female would be amazing, though the summary of your statement on that is “you have to earn your human equality,” whether you intended that or not. A pro-female would help a lot, and seeing how she would be simultaneously white-knighted and mocked (as women in power often experience based on *gender*) in greater public view would likely also help to develop norms saying “Hey, this isn’t right.”\n\nAs for me, I never mentioned anything about the sexiness of champions in League. I actually appreciate the diversity of champions. Where there is Miss Fortune, LeBlanc, and Ahri, etc, there is also Leona, Vi, Tristana, Poppy, Anivia, Karma, Irelia, Kayle, Annie, Lulu, Riven, etc. Riot has done a lot for diversity in champions. \n**So while I said nothing about female champion design in prior posts, I love that League does not offer the token, desperately stereotypical female champion (who probably needs a man to save her) like many other games do. There are sexy champions in the stereotypical sense, and MANY others with MANY types of personalities, all strong.**\n\nUnlike you, I am not giving up at just “Oh well, there will be no change and at least things aren’t as bad here as somewhere else, therefore I will accept things as they are and hope for the best.” It’s why I went into social research. I aim to better my world and embrace challenge.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"VaIence","date":"2013-09-18T20:58:27.952+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"If 20,000 people call a female gamer an ugly bitch, she is being sent the message that she must conform to a socially prescribed ideal of beauty which stems from a longstanding problem of seeing women as only useful for their appearance, or as blatant sex objects. Additionally, \"bitch\" is a derogatory term often used against women who display more agentic characteristics such as aggressiveness and assertiveness which are stereotypically considered male traits. As a result, \"ugly bitch\" is the embodiment of what society thinks of agentic women trying to break the mold of traditional gender stereotypes by displaying more masculine characteristics. And that is a problem. It has nothing to do with her competency at a video game. It has nothing to do with her actions. It is harassment based on an unchangeable physical characteristic. This wouldn't really be outside of the scope of feminism.\n\nOn the other hand, Reginald is experiencing flak for completely different reasons. Other than the eyebrow joke, all of the flak he has received comes from his performances and the way he is leading TSM. It is not based based on physical characteristics like race, gender, age or appearance (again, minus the eyebrow joke).\n\nAlso the harassment in itself is not what matters, what matters is that these kinds of insults carry messages of conformity to a gender ideal that is flawed and needs to be changed. Feminism is much more interested in the negative effects of gender harassment rather than the negative experiences of women who are being harassed because in the end, change will only occur if we change our gender ideals, not simply by stopping harassment. This harassment however continues to reinforce the status quo which is why it is important for it to be dealt with and discussed.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
