Is it that I need much more experience stacking FF AND being there for the lanes? Or that FF and EL are better with different builds (e.g. I see EL endorsed for pure assassin Rengar, and FF for bruiser Rengar)?\r\n\r\nDOUBLE OR: Screw Rengar in the jungle and learn how to top with him. Besides, both items are getting removed in the next season (See Surrender At 20's website for spoilers/ experimental changes).\r\n\r\nI'd appreciate the insight :)","replies":[{"poster":"Tooth Burglar","date":"2014-10-14T10:53:47.113+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly I think both are fine, but if you look at the statistics for item winrates on LolKing, flare has a much higher winrate than elder lizard.  That's likely because if you are able to complete flare before the game ends, you're probably doing something right.  Whereas stats for wriggles are unavailable.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Spreek","date":"2014-10-11T20:50:37.974+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"imo just go madreds and leave it there for a while.","replies":[]}]}
