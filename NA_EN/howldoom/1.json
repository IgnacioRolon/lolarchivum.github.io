Any and all suggestions for me would be appreciated, but I feel that the advice I've already received in the past hasn't helped too much yet. I also find myself having winning streaks and losing streaks, going up and down and keeping me largely in the same place I've been in for months.","replies":[{"poster":"OhBoyItsaMegaman","date":"2014-10-07T18:21:20.393+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Would you be okay with having me spectate you? I do not see anything immediately jump out as wrong in your match history. If I watched you for a game or two, I could get a better idea of what you can work on to climb out of Bronze.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Subdue","date":"2014-10-07T18:14:50.308+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"In bronze, winning is less about mechanically good and more about just being where you should be, when you should be there.  People often spend so much time derping about there, that you can get every dragon, sneak every turret, catch people wandering around, etc over and over again.  My advice to you is that you should watch some matches with more skilled players.  Look at how they approach objectives, what sort of strategies they employ, and how they build upon advantages or cover for disadvantages.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tahra","date":"2014-10-07T17:53:19.543+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think the biggest thing is to have a reliable duo partner, doubles your chances of having a decent team, especially if you both are bottom lane.","replies":[]},{"poster":"StOrmysLIVE","date":"2014-10-11T09:23:40.218+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Looking at your stats, I'm going to guess the number one reason why you can't carry is because you die. Probably because I'm plat, I find bronze games ridiculously easy to carry as adc for these reasons:\n\n1) both sides will make stupid moves constantly throughout the game and repeatedly throw.\n2) because of 1) as the adc it is very easy to get fed\n3) staying alive is the most important thing, because you are essentially the objective destroyer, and as long as you are alive even if you are \"behind\", your team will take out objectives exponentially faster with you than without you\n\n4) You are dying because you are getting caught, I'm assuming mainly because you don't know when to enter a team fight (or your position is bad)\n5) Whenever you are in a teamfight, DO NOT ENTER IT until all the hard cc that can catch you is blown. Once it is blown you get a free pass to rape their face. Sometimes this might mean that you have to enter when your teammates are nearly dead (and with bronze, people will chase like no other after low hp people, so if you enter a teamfight late zero people will ever focus you, because they are trying to finish off your teammates)\n6) biggest thing for any role is itemization. If you are behind you have to learn how to be more efficient with how you spend your gold. Even an extremely high damage carry like yourself can be 100% useless if you die without ever doing any attacks. \n\nThis breaks down to two things:\n\na) if you notice a certain champ is constantly catching you and resulting in your death, instead of finishing your whatever damage item, start building armor/mr against that champ, so even if they do catch you, you will end up alive\n\nb) in a teamfight if you tend to have to attack a certain champ (because maybe they keep wall-blocking you from your team),your option is to either ignore them and fight the team, or build your items to do the max amount of damage vs that champ. So if a full tank malphite is in your face, and you don't have armor pen, you might be better off walking past him to fight the rest of the team, or run away. of course if all their cd's are up and they can spam skills on you, you ignore it.\n\np.s. last thing- your cs is bronze/silver level. You need to practice and bring that average count up. This will help you the most when you are behind and trying to catch up.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Xela Syab","date":"2014-10-11T08:30:18.050+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok I've gotten out of bronze 2 times now. \n1. If a badass-carries-the-game-single-handedly champ is open and his counters are banned nab him (Yi, Xin, Trynd, Nasus, Fizz, Kayle, Teemo, Jax)\n2. Last hit, seriously its important, also nabbing jungle camps when they are ganking is good too. \n3. Don't die in lane needlessly Bronze games are usually decided by 2 fed champs on the map, use wards where enemies can jump you, watch enemy movements and check mias before pushing.\n4. Master 15-25 champs and have 6-10 runepages. Pretty much runepages for each role (mage, adc, tank, bruiser, assassin)\n Best sups for bronze, Janna (best peels in game and give bf sword to carry), Blitz(displacing initiation and cc), Sona (does everything), Taric (auras and cc), Braum (shuts down poke), Leona (cc for days), Thresh (clutch saves), Morg (cc and cc prevention).\nBest Jungs for Bronze, Amumu (aoe cc), Rengar (carry killer), Master Yi (kills everything if fed), Wukong (tanky and heavy aoe damage), Xin Zhao (lockdown displace single target kil), Pantheon (cc, heavy aoe damage), Fiddlesticks (cc, heavy aoe damage) Warwick (carrykiller). \nBest tops for bronze, Nasus(farm and win), Yorick (poke and win), Garen (dont get hit and win), Trynd (farm and kill), Teemo (shrooms), Jayce (massive poke), Fiora(if not focused will kill whole team), Kayle(does everything) Jax(jumpstuns). \nBest mids for bronze, Fizz(combo kills), Syndra (poke cc from halfway across map), Ryze (lockdown apdps), Malz (carrykiller), Kass (janitor), Zed (carrykiller), Jayce (poke), Ahri (bob's and weaves), Akali (jumpkills). \nBest carries for bronze, Tristana(range and jumps), Vayne (chasekills), Caitlyn (range, cc, poke), Graves(aoe damage), Ashe(cc), Kog'maw(tank killer, threat after death).\n5. Keep your cool, recover if things go bad, mute annoying teammates, focus on winning the game.\n6. Teamcomps, pick a champ that fills a niche needed or that syncs with other champs. (Lux and Morg) (Yi and Trynd) (Lee and Teemo) (Nocturne and SIvir)\n7. Counterpicks... stil have to have skill though.\n8. Objectives: towers, buff camps, dragon, baron. \n9. Somehow win 4v5. This is the hardest, since about 20% of your bronze games will have an afk troll leaver pretty much pick a champ that can hit multiple targets simultaneously Kayle/Yi.\n10. Do everything you can. Even if you lose learn as much as you can from the game. (where the enemy ganked from, their teamcomp strength, the engagements, where to ward, picking battles)","replies":[]}]}
