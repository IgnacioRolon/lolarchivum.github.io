The first part is already concluded, which sucks, but this is a great opportunity for other cultures to learn more about Japan and the cherry blossom festival. Let's spread cultural awareness and bring this event (or at least the icons) to other servers too! \n\nhttp://hanarifu.jp.leagueoflegends.com/imgs/reward-06.png\nhttp://hanarifu.jp.leagueoflegends.com/imgs/reward-03.png","replies":[{"poster":"Jofeyy","date":"2017-04-01T18:56:27.604+0000","up_votes":20,"down_votes":0,"body":"When was the last time NA had something exclusive :(. \n\nI really dont remember tho lol","replies":[{"poster":"Malicious Metal","date":"2017-04-02T00:22:15.506+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Neither does EUW","replies":[{"poster":"doodlebob666","date":"2017-04-02T00:54:26.501+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":1,"body":"if they make a losers bracket for worlds that would hit two birds with one stone","replies":[{"poster":"Harmony11","date":"2017-04-30T02:16:53.114+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{summoner:14}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jofeyy","date":"2017-04-02T03:09:26.746+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"savage af man chill :P","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2017-04-05T12:10:33.484+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"EUW *just* got the Slumber Party...","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Slimegoon","date":"2017-04-02T13:36:04.070+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://i.imgur.com/1U3lNEH.gif","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"WookieeCookie","date":"2017-04-05T00:00:58.469+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":1,"body":"Checked with the e-commerce team today and the plan is that these icons will make their way to regions outside of Japan \"soon\"  (FORGIVE ME). \n\nI have no context on pricing or a specific launch date though.","replies":[{"poster":"Lucifer","date":"2017-04-05T15:18:58.713+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Omg yes!!!
