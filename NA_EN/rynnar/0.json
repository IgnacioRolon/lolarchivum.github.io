I later logged in to open a chest because I had 1 yesterday and could now craft a key, but when I opened the menu, I still had 1. Now I could even be imagining I hadd 1 key fragment, but the fact that I still have one means it did not register.","replies":[{"poster":"Rynnar","date":"2017-08-07T01:57:06.642+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh ok, maybe those happened. I will check. Sorry to bug you over two fragments.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-07T03:22:50.348+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No worries ^_^!

There's also a chance that when crafting was reenabled, it for some reason triggered that notification again. After looking over your hextech history though, it does look like you're sitting at the right amount.","replies":[]}]}
