It appeared that the guy was using hacked credit cards to buy me RP. \nLong story short , i know it's my fault for dealing with such individuals , the guy blocked me on facebook and i have no way of finding his contact information . So i want to know what can i do knowing that in my country i can't pay the charges , i would if i could but sadly i can't and if there is anyone hoping to help me pay back the miniscule amout i've been charged please may he or she contact me i would be grateful for life and will pay you back in anyway i could. \nhere's my email if you would like to see the email riot sent me and help \nEmail: -snip, removing for security-\nAnd thank you for your time \nPlease troll elsewhere","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2018-01-03T19:03:23.326+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is a really unfortunate circumstance.  :(  Making deals with strangers like this is super risky and one of the biggest reasons we don't support it, but I'm not sure what we could do about this case.  I'm really sorry that this situation ended up happening to you, and hope everything will work out.  Your best bet is to continue speaking with your Specialist to find some options.","replies":[{"poster":"FirasPvP","date":"2018-01-03T19:14:11.163+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for your support , i'll try talking to riot to see what i can do about it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"FirasPvP","date":"2018-01-04T18:19:43.466+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bump , no help ?","replies":[]}]}
