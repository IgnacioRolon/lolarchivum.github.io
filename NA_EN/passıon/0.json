It&#039;s my job to catch this Volibear, and don&#039;t let him recall. But as I stay on his trail, I keep spamming laugh for fun. But something weird happens after that. As I&#039;m passing our blue, another voice starts laughing. It doesn&#039;t sound like Volibear, or ANY other champion in the game. It creeps me out to hear it, because it never happened again. I went back to the area to try summoning the mysterious voice again, but nothing happened. I couldn&#039;t explore all of the jungles, because they surrendered.\n\nForget my series, please tell me what just happened.\n\n~~EDIT: It also happened yesterday. But every single time it happens, if I go to champion select, the sound of mastery points continuously plays during champion select.~~\n\nEDIT: That was a patch bug I guess, it's not really a problem anymore","replies":[{"poster":"Solidair3","date":"2015-06-14T23:08:54.381+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Very strange indeed! A possible teaser for the next champion? A new Event?

While they're used to show the scale of a champion, we've seen this sort of thing before:\nhttp://3.bp.blogspot.com/-QTkAa0c_-4w/U798KAgCujI/AAAAAAAAMjA/pY57vs6nqMI/s1921/malphite-mecha-skin-splash-1920x1080.jpg\n\nIn Mecha Malphite's splash art, we see Ziggs and Heimer drawn in as a scale, even though they're low detail.\n\nSkin Splash Arts have previewed champions before. Most notably, Vel'Koz was previewed in Creator Viktor's splash art four months before he was released.\nhttp://lolwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Creator-Viktor.jpg\n\n------\nNow, lets look at the hint given in the patch notes, shall we? I think it can be divided into two subjects, one part hinting about the laugh, and the other part hinting about who it's for.\n\nThe laugh is easy to piece together\n\n>For those of you struggling to keep up in your games of League, we're always striving to ensure you won't be stuck up **the river** without a paddle. [...] Mope, and you mope alone - **laugh, and the world laughs with you**. Or so they say.\n\nIt's easy to see, since we already know what it is. What remains should, in theory, be hints about the new champion:\n\n> And that about **encapsulates** the contents of this patch. [...] That said, **if conventional means don't work, be careful who you call when seeking help**; [...] there's all sorts of things out there, **preying on the wishes of desperate people**. \n>\n> Boy that was **crypt**ic\n\nEncapsulates seems too out of place with everything else to be a coincidence, although what it means I don't know. The rest sounds like a witch doctor, someone who's *unconventional* means you seek out after *conventional* options have failed, reserved for the most desperate situations.\n\nThe last one just sounds like a Riot pun if it is about Tabu, since they already put the nail in his coffin.\n\n--------\n\nWith all that said, it's just a theory, and should be taken with several grains of salt. Fortunately, salt doesn't seem to be hard to find in League ;)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Riot Eno","date":"2015-06-14T22:36:34.077+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":2,"body":"It's creeping me out too...","replies":[{"poster":"Toa of Death","date":"2015-06-15T00:46:08.730+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I forgot it was there in one of my games so when I spammed laugh for fun I jumped when something laughed back.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Antonok","date":"2015-06-14T21:06:57.544+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's known, a teaser of some sort.
