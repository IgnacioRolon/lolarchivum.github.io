They will not be different; kept consistent just as they are now - just a themed added to. These themed maps will be consistent with LoL's fictional world and alternate worlds. Additionally, these themed maps can include festive themes (e.g. Harrowing, U.R.F., Winter Holidays, etc). **All of them playing LoL's recent cool music**.\n> \n> * [Associated Maps] - Maps Consistent With Runeterra Locations & Majority Skin Theme\n>  * default theme (re-identified)\n>  * Bilgewater Map Theme\n>  * Demacia Map Theme\n>  * Noxus Map Theme\n>  * Zaun Map Theme\n>  * Ionia Map Theme\n>  * Piltover Map Theme\n>  * Icathia Map Theme\n>  * Kumungo Map Theme\n>  * Shadow Isle Map Theme\n>  * Shurima Map Theme\n>  * Cosmos Map Theme (in space!)\n>  * and the others...\n> \n> \n> * [Promotional Maps] - Special Alternate Themes Of Specific Skins\n>  * Sci-Fi Map (Project, Battlecast, Mecha, Eternum, Full Metal, Bioforge skins)\n>  * [Bit Map](http://euw.leagueoflegends.com/sites/default/files/styles/scale_xlarge/public/upload/leagueoflegends_62_1920x1080.png) (all Arcade skins)\n>  * Ancient Map (Sandstorm, Guardian of the Sands skins)\n>  * Heavenly Map (Justicar, Arclight skins)\n>  * Hellish Map (Blood Moon, Soul skins)\n>  * Summer Map (Pool Party skins) \n>  * Draven's Map (Draaaven)\n> \n>  \n> * [Festive Maps]\n>  * All the festivals.\n>  * All the events.\n>  * An eSports map?\n> \n> **How can it be done?**\n> Champion skin _archetype themes_: Many champions have a similar theme going on and others are alternate and outstanding. When the majority of chosen skins fall into an theme archetype an associated map will load.\n> \n> More or less simple as that!\n> \n> **What will this do?**\n> Variety that will vastly improve the game on so many levels. Increase value of all those skins across the board (increased consistent RP sales?). Possibly even sustain an increased/increasing playerbase; increased profit yield?.\n> You know..
