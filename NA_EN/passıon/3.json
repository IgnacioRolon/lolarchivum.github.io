But these are the two that I believe are easily the best (at least in my opinion.) But it&#039;s so hard to choose which one is *the* best... So what do you think? I used to think that Jhin would always hold the #1 spot for themes, but now I&#039;m not sure.\r\n\r\nFor Reference\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gU_HpD0hWY&amp;t=89s vs https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSQZqVsaKWY\r\n\r\nYou might not like either of them, or think that either of them are the best.

There's no better introduction to Dragon Trainer Tristana than her theme. \n\nYou catch my drift :) There's no better piece, as long as they're all the best fit they can be. \n\nThanks for listening!\n\nEd the Conqueror","replies":[{"poster":"Shíny","date":"2017-04-09T17:44:25.514+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How do you feel about Illaoi's theme and how it fits her?\nI've always had some concerns about it feeling more like a \"Kraken theme\" and not really an Illaoi theme.","replies":[{"poster":"Ed the Conqueror","date":"2017-04-10T01:01:31.919+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ShinyJumanjiMan,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=LpUdbXAK,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2017-04-09T17:44:25.514+0000)\n>\n> How do you feel about Illaoi&#x27;s theme and how it fits her?\n> I&#x27;ve always had some concerns about it feeling more like a &quot;Kraken theme&quot; and not really an Illaoi theme.\n\nHa! This one I can talk about as well because I wrote it.\n\nIllaoi is actually one of my favorite pieces that I wrote for League. \n\nI never thought of what you're describing, but I guess it somehow makes sense. Remember, in her own words, \"ALL is Nagakabouros\". Really everything she says or does has something to do with 1) Nagakabouros itself, or 2) being worthy/unworthy of Nagakabouros. While I never set out to write a kraken theme and really focused on writing for her character, she and her god are very closely intertwined.\n\nThe rest of her theme was an attempt of describing Buhru and the surrounding islands. \n\nThanks for listening!","replies":[{"poster":"patmax17","date":"2017-04-10T07:24:48.770+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi!\n\nI love many of League's theme songs (i have the complete playlist on a usb stick in a car to listen to when I drive), but I too think that Illaoi's (<3 <3) theme is strange: looking at her I had expected something more tribal, with drums and rhythm (not as extreme as Rengar's theme, but similar).\n\nI must say though that there are a lot of themes I love and find extremely fitting: aurelion sol, taliyah, nami, braum, Bilgewater. Just, Illaoi's theme feelst strange to me ^^\n\nEDIT - let's put it in a more constructive and interesting way: would you mind explaining a bit your choice for Illaoi? What does her theme music tell you, what did you want to convey? Why did you chose those specific instruments and sounds, and not others? What were your sources of inspiration? :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Placentas","date":"2017-04-10T01:28:52.246+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just throwing some flattery your way; you and your teammates make very beautiful and moving music.

The strings put you at peace and make your hairs on end. It's entrancing yet shocking at the same time, speaking volumes of Jhin's belief of beauty in death, such an unusual and self-contrasting belief. A chilling piece, to be certain that haunts you to the core.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Niyumi","date":"2017-04-09T03:37:04.952+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dragontrainer Tristana is easily my favorite login theme, followed by Snowdown 2015.","replies":[]}]}
