Her E does like 0 damage at 1 stack. I think it should be changed entirely to deal 300/500/700/900/1100 true damage with 1 stack and multiply by 3 for each stack.\n\nShe finally becomes a good pick and maybe just maybe she&#039;ll be good enough to get the Victorious skin next year.\n\nhttp://www.dogchannel.com/images/news/2014/science-dog.jpg","replies":[]}
