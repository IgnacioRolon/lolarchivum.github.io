I know in this case it may have been out of control, but the system is going to treat every leave equally because it still causes other players a negative experience.  Let me know if that clears things up!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Galacius","date":"2017-07-08T19:37:23.939+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Heya Ramp,\n\n I am here to tell you that unfortunately they do not take away leaverbusters. This [Leaverbuster](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ) FAQ can answer all of your questions. Of particular note is this section: \n\n>IT'S NOT MY FAULT. MY INTERNET/YOUR SERVERS DISCONNECTED ME. I HAD A REAL-LIFE EMERGENCY. I HAD TO GET OFF THE COMPUTER. THE GAME CRASHED. UNBAN ME!\nWe understand that players may be forced to leave from time to time so the system has been designed to keep these situations in mind. After leaving a few games, you will be placed into a low priority queue; as long as you can complete 5 matchmade games without leaving, you will be returned to the normal queue. However, if you continue to leave games, you will remain in the low priority queue.\n\n>Note: You are responsible for all activity that occurs on your account.
