Take Diana, she was intended to be a Nashor&#039;s Tooth diver, but has been and is a 1 shot mid lane/jungle assassin.  While this unhealthy game play pattern has persisted for years, nothing has been done about it. Her numbers could be reduced and her durability increased; de-incentivizing an assassin build and incentivizing a diver build.  It wouldn&#039;t fix all of her game health issues but it would be a huge step forward.  It&#039;s just kinda left there and ignored in hopes the champion never becomes able to consistently succeed because their success case is so incredibly unhealthy.  Even when small changes could help mitigate a champion&#039;s problems, like Warwick&#039;s passive change from his previous state to his VGU, they&#039;re generally saved until a full VGU is done.  To not change things because they wouldn&#039;t fix all game health issues feels like a nirvana fallacy.  I may be cherry picking and ignoring some champs that have been changed, but I keep seeing champs in unhealthy states year after year after year with the excuse &#039;we can&#039;t find a good change.&#039;  Any help would be good for these kinds of champions.\r\n\r\nWhy aren&#039;t champions with unhealthy game play patterns fixed more often, why are they left to languish in hopes they just don&#039;t cause a huge problem until they&#039;re formally reworked?","replies":[{"poster":"Kaioko","date":"2017-02-15T15:30:38.097+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Your example isn't exactly unhealthy.

Being played out of role because they're unhealthy in the other role is an issue - like Trinity Force Alistar top.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Big Lincoln","date":"2017-02-15T15:28:39.708+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"i prefer diana as an assassin\n\nhave yet to see an attack speed champion that promotes interesting gameplay","replies":[{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2017-02-15T15:31:17.568+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd argue Yasuo honestly.

Diana is a diver/assassin whose gameplay boils down to either one shotting someone in .14 seconds or dying.  That's not healthy.  Either she's a zero counterplay assassin or a graduated minion.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TheHappyReaperz","date":"2017-02-15T15:26:40.337+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, what would you do with someone like Aatrox?

They need considerable overhauls to make them viable and playable. They are both extremely volatile, with things such as items or minor tweaks exploding into massive problems down the line due to the butterfly effect. They simply have too much going on in their kits to be simply fixed by numbers.\n\nCamille is actually a perfect example of a champion who was OP, but has a kit designed in such a way that mere number tweaks and implementing minor clauses (such as the need to hit a champ with E to trigger the bonuses, the ult ending on death) have fixed her. After her massive nerfs in the last patch, she's actually in a well-off place now since she's down to more manageable numbers.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Poske","date":"2017-02-15T16:02:30.076+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh you mean why they AATROX champs?\n\nBecause balance team is a joke","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2017-02-15T15:20:07.862+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Usually because they can't be fixed so simply.
