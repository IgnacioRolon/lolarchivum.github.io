To help rule out possibilities, what happens if you try to specate on the legacy client?\n\n-  On the login screen of the open beta updated client, look for the \"Launch Legacy Client\" text at the bottom.\n-  Or create a shortcut directly to the legacy client in your League Installation. Just look for \"lol.launcher\" \n\nLet me know what happens!","replies":[{"poster":"Bharzaroz","date":"2017-01-24T21:59:11.025+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am playing on the EUNE.
