Riot does look at the boards but they can't respond to every single thread. I'm not Riot so I don't know all the details, but what I do know is that if you want to get in touch with Riot directly the quickest way to do that is through a Support Ticket. It's your choice on whether you want to do that or not but you really should stop with the name-calling and insult-swinging towards people who are trying to help you.\n\nRespect and communication goes both ways so if you want people to be respectful to you then you need to be respectful to them.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Mace of Aids","date":"2015-11-18T00:13:25.498+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":9,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Prandine,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=XGh0VyFb,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-11-17T23:48:30.475+0000)\n>\n> It got deleted as it was posted in the wrong sub-forum.

I'm not a Moderator and never said I was.\n2. If you have an issue with Riot then filing a Support Ticket is the best way to do it.\n3.
