This has gotten to the point where the boards already know Riot is not going to listen to feedback, so in return they don't bother saying \"Fix X\", but instead say \"Riot's team is a joke\". Honestly, I don't disagree with the boards either. Imagine you're playing a game of League Ranked, and your adc is overextending constantly without vision, dying all the time. You tell the adc to stop overextending, but they dont listen, thus the adc ends up ruining the game for all 4 of your team mates because they wont listen.

I think that boards would in fact be of much higher quality if there were significantly increased moderation. Since we're all here, I can ditch my saltiness to offer some feedback that I feel would make things better. At least then this topic wouldn't be a matter of who agrees or disagrees that boards is ass lol\n\n* Voting needs relevancy. It's been such a popularity system for years now. If you've seen me talk about it then you'd know my opinion on up/down votes: it should be based on how relevant a comment or topic is, at least in regards to discussing anything relelvant to the game, not just general meme posts. I also believe that a reason should be given for a person's vote, or else it'd just go back to the popularity grind. That would be more difficult to impliment than it's worth, though. If nothing else is considered, then at LEAST we can just remove downvotes. With the current system, the only things I ever see downvoted are everything someone doesn't like but makes perfect sense, such as \"I think this near naked female champion is too sexualized\". That should not be in the negative votes for any reason, and wouldn't be for any reason other than the fact that people like seeing a naked female champion.\n* Boards needs a spam detector. Self-explanatory, really. I hate that I'll check boards and see upwards of ten posts about the same thing with no construction added to the topic. Everyone copy+pastes the same thoughts, and for what I've seen repeatedly I'm pretty sure it's because people believe that if there are a hundred posts about the same thing that means Riot is required to listen and make the change and if Riot doesn't follow those hundred threads then it's a bad company. That's the type of nonsense that gets perpetuated in Boards without impedement lol\n* Resourceful citation requested. I'm still upset that there are people who quote a wiki page for patch notes even though we have a patch notes page. Fake news should not be allowed to be spread in a non-memed manner. There should not be a trending topic of \"This rune is ass look what it does doesn't it suck?\" yet everything said about the rune is incorrect.\n* Is...is trolling reportable? That's an actual question lmao and if it's not, it should be. I've never experienced it here myself, but I've seen many threads where those who consider themselves \"intelligent trolls\" constantly bother people with irrelevant nonsense just because they can't convince a poster of something. All it does is frustrate the poster and ruin the quality of the thread and conversation.\n\nWell, that's my construction of the day. It's too early for me to think this hard on stuff. Again though, I wholly understand that the mod team is both unpaid and busy, and that moderation takes time and effort that doesn't allow for constant activity. That's a major point that should be considered throughout this conversation.","replies":[{"poster":"AugustHeatHaze","date":"2018-12-05T22:49:43.924+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"id looove to see all these things","replies":[{"poster":"The Highest Noon","date":"2018-12-06T02:20:03.123+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=AugustHeatHaze,realm=NA,application-id=6heBIhQc,discussion-id=E6BeJEiw,comment-id=000700000000,timestamp=2018-12-05T22:49:43.924+0000)\n>\n> id looove to see all these things\n\nMaybe one day.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"mack9112","date":"2018-12-01T22:58:56.191+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":5,"body":"These boards are pretty toxic and we need to change as a community..","replies":[{"poster":"AugustHeatHaze","date":"2018-12-05T23:33:38.037+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thank youuuu this is exactly the problem","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"The Highest Noon","date":"2018-12-03T14:20:57.377+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Boards, full of toxicity and deconstructive complaints\nRiot: Boards is toxic and negative\nBoards: \n\nhttps://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/027/475/Screen_Shot_2018-10-25_at_11.02.15_AM.png","replies":[]},{"poster":"Xeronic","date":"2018-12-03T08:24:24.165+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Boards bashes all rioters \nBoards= Calm\n>One rioter bashes the boards\nBoards= Outrage \n\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-mindblown}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"ÆR09","date":"2018-12-03T03:06:20.100+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean boards still thinks zed is op even though hes basically an int pick at this point so I partially agree with him...","replies":[]},{"poster":"SociopathFriend","date":"2018-12-02T21:57:35.334+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Frankly I have no problem with a Developer who likely had no part in making the Boards or running them ripping on the Boards.

I for one do not care how \"offended\" you feel if Riot say something about you that is 100% valid and correct.

I don't think Riot has a policy against pointing out the negativity of Boards. I don't think that manners has anything to do with telling the truth. Basic manners and civility would be to speak the truth and not be offended by it. I'm more offended by the fact that people are offended for being called toxic when they are in fact toxic. How does anything ever get solved when people choose to be offended when being told the truth?","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2018-12-02T02:05:34.646+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=The Highest Noon,realm=NA,application-id=6heBIhQc,discussion-id=E6BeJEiw,comment-id=00050000000000000000,timestamp=2018-12-02T00:30:52.576+0000)\n>\n> What is Riot&#x27;s social media policy?

It may get a pass since the tweet was quickly deleted, but I remind you that a Rioter was recently fired for violating this policy.\n\nI don't even know why you think the insult's accuracy is relevant; it's still rude, which violates Riot's employee policy as well as basic social mores. It may be true that the Boards are in a pretty sorry state right now, but that's no reason for a Rioter to trash-talk LoL's official forum and its users. Are any of your friends or family overweight? Do you refer to them as \"fatso\" merely because it's true, or do you avoid hurtful, _non-constructive_ criticism?","replies":[{"poster":"The Highest Noon","date":"2018-12-02T13:55:27.455+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"I don't know why you think pointing out a flaw is an insult. That's a terrible problem with your thinking right there, and much of 2018 American society at that.\n\nAccording to the tweet quote, there wasn't an insult. Boards was called awful and a negative value. Does that offend you to hear that this site is awful and a negative value? I'm not. My experience with Boards is majority a detriment to my overall League of Legends experience. Most of what I see repulses me. Are you offended by the fact that much of this site repulses and hinders me?\n\nTo answer your question, yes I do have overweight family members. Guess what? They want to lose weight. Guess what else? I do point out how and why they're overweight. And when I catch them going against advice that they themselves speak and follow, I do in fact say \"See, this is why you're still as big as you are.\" What, do you want me to say \"Great job you're losing weight!\" or \"Hey you're still the same weight! Great job!\"\n\nI think youre biggest issue is that you can't fathom the difference between insult and criticism. You can have critical criticism of something and not be insulting. If you feel insulted by criticism, that's a you problem.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
