But ever since Windows 10 updated, i have not been able to play League. It always crashes after champs lock in and i have tried a few solutions with no luck. I have repaired the game, i have updated drivers and i have ran the game in administrator. I have no idea what else to do and its very annoying. \r\n\r\nhttp://imgur.com/a/fABPl","replies":[{"poster":"DevlinCrow","date":"2016-08-17T13:54:54.915+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have this same issue mate did you find a fix?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-16T23:07:48.335+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since you've put a ticket in already, I strongly recommend continuing to be patient while a specialist gets back to you. We've been pretty slammed with tickets lately, but our teams are working their butts off. Please avoid replying to or \"bumping\" your ticket before someone gets back to you, as it sends you ticket to the back of the queue and lengthens the time it takes for us to get back to you.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[{"poster":"zachi2","date":"2016-08-17T00:48:53.937+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the only thing i did to my ticket was tack on a screen shot of the bug splat error so it was probably sent back.
