You can only purchase another Black Spear and use it if it's before that point.

Otherwise I'd just bind it later on to someone like kennen, galio, etc. in order to have better initiates. Its meant to give her a partner \"for life\", so that she always has to work with said partner, instead of rebinding to the initiator.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-10-01T16:27:39.128+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Zyvux,realm=NA,application-id=LqLKtMpN,discussion-id=bfligAl4,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2015-10-01T00:19:38.610+0000)\n>\n> That's so that she cannot simply re-bind to a stronger engager late game if she has someone like a raka support.
