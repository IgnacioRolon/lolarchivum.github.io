HELP ME PLEASE!","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Before you ask, here is my ticket... #24442025\r\n\r\nSaturday I noticed 200 dollars missing from my account. I looked it up and it was 2 $100 purchases of RP. I knew I didn't do that so I tried to log on to my account. It said that my account has been transferred.... crap. Someone stole my account and because my card was linked to it they purchased 200 dollars worth of RP. I contact Riot support through a ticket, the one above. They ask me a long series of questions to verify me as the owner. I answer them and then they ask me more. I answer those as well. They finally verify me as the owner and send me an email for a password change. I do that and think I finally have my account back. Nope. I go to log in to my account and it says my account has been transferred (this is using the new password). I try the old password and the new and nothing is happening. They didn't transfer my account back to NA. I then go on an investigation to find what region my account is on. Through op.gg I found that my account has been transferred to Russia. I message back on the support ticket but I still have not heard anything back. I cannot log in to the Russian account with the new or old password. The password change didn't do anything. I really want an actually riot employee to talk to me here, so we can get it figured out together.\r\n\r\nTLDR\r\nI have played for 6 years, account stolen, transferred to russia, charged 200 dollars for RP, Riot verifies me as the owner and sends password change email, change password, still can't log in, account still in russia, no response on ticket.\r\n\r\nRIOT EMPLOYEES PLEASE HELP ME.","replies":[{"poster":"BREADTANGLE","date":"2016-11-29T00:37:33.285+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bumping for visibility","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-29T22:57:26.536+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It looks like you received a reply from your account specialist.
