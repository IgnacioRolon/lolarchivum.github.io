I'm on my college dorm network (with both an ethernet and a wifi connection) when these issues occur, several times a week.  \r\n\r\nIf it doesn't force a disconnection from the match, all that I can see are the players moving around.  No animations, particles, sound effects, ui or gameplay updates (such as the gold counter going up, experience, levels, etc.)  Though the game clock continues to increase unhindered.  \r\n\r\nIf it does disconnect, it either fails to reconnect or does so after 4-5 minutes of waiting, to which I reconnect to encounter the poor gameplay.  \r\n\r\nLeague of Legends is the ONLY program that has this issue.  DOTA 2, Rainbow Six Siege, Counterstrike Global Offensive, Arma 3, etc, none of them are impacted in the slightest during this time frame.  Voice chat quality or video streaming also have no issues.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt could just be that they decide to either reset the network or sync/update all the campus computers at that time, though usually we get a warning if something like that is going to happen several days in advance.  This issue has been going on for a while, several years now (would happen once every few weeks), but only recently became a major issue where it happens almost daily.  \r\n\r\nOS:  Windows 8.1\r\nBackground Updates or regularly scheduled scans:  None during this timeframe\r\nRAM: 8GB + 2GB dedicated directly to the video card\r\nProcessor: I7  (3rd gen I think)\r\n\r\nI'd also love to complain about autopathing, but I'll save that for another post.  (Where you click on the same spot twice and it literally just turns you around and walks towards the enemy instead)\r\n\r\nI've verified the files, reinstalled once, etc.  Maybe I need to do something specific with my firewall and anti-malware programs?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-27T20:55:24.675+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since this happens on your campus network, have you reached out to your network administrator to see if there's something scheduled to run at that time  and the intervals you notice this at? I suspect there may be maintenance or something planned that happens during this time.\n\nIf you still encounter issues after speaking to your network admin, let me know.","replies":[{"poster":"Phantasmal Dawn","date":"2016-09-29T13:45:23.839+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've contacted NetOps, and am currently waiting on a reply.","replies":[]}]}]}
