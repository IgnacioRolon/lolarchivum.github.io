Everyone else was feeding, everyone kept focusing me and I was in my promos and after I said that like 2 or 3 ppl reported me and now im here with you like tbh this punishment system that riot upgraded is too harsh on tracking people down. I remember one of my friend would flame every single game straight for 5 games and get lots of reports and not get punished but now even if you don't swear you get punished. Like there's no way you can release some stress during game now.","replies":[{"poster":"Urmysoul","date":"2017-10-09T01:42:44.377+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same as you I got honors from every single game before the 2 games I played in my promos, I get atleast 1 honor every game and sometimes more often now 2.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-09T04:13:17.858+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That message you saw was likely letting you know that your Honor progression had been unlocked, meaning you're now able to progress at a normal rate and able to get hextech loot items again.","replies":[]}]}
