She literally just push lanes all game and keep give kills to other team. I didn't even say anything rude and I was just saying she's flaming and inting. After that she starts going by how people from other country play on the NA server should get out of this server? I was like wtf you racist monkey? Now riot is giving me a suspension just because of that and not this adc who died 14 times and telling people to get out of the server?","replies":[{"poster":"Julevi","date":"2019-05-08T01:41:24.833+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mind sharing the full chatlog with us?","replies":[]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-05-08T01:47:53.341+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Was saying \"wtf you racist monkey\" supposed to improve the situation?

I tried to prevent things and even told my ADC that we have to play safe (which was no problem with our given match-up). I did not feed, gave the enemy ADC 1-2 kills and the situation was okayish.

I said Incompetence is WORSE than \"toxicity\". Not that both are bad.\n\nLike it or not, incompetence is also the number one cause of \"toxicity\". Whether the perception is accurate or not, toxicity arises when a player is perceived as being incompetent and costing the team a win 9 times out of 10.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
