Here's a link to a post I made ~2 weeks ago. Sadly it never got noticed, but I think if Veigar does need future changes, this should be looked at, because it can lead to a lot of gold/AP which might not be obtained otherwise\n\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report/aBLwwEQj-veigars-e-grants-assists-before-stun-is-active-rleagueoflegends\n\nas a TL;DR, the potential bug is that if you are in the event horizon zone as it arms, but before leave BEFORE the stun is active and never get stunned or trapped in the cage, Veigar still gets an assist even if he never was able to get any damage down. I argue that, while he should be getting assists for anyone stuck inside his E AFTER the stun is armed (as they are forced to stay in a confined space or usually burn a summoner to get out)  it shouldn't work this way for BEFORE the stun is armed, because champions like Bard, Ziggs, Pantheon, Cho'Gath, etc... who have indicators for spells that take time to arm do not get assists without actually doing damage to the enemy if someone was in the indicator and died before it was active (or left it before it armed and died to someone else)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Solo Josh","date":"2015-10-07T23:39:03.626+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"LordGeovanni","date":"2015-10-08T12:47:30.015+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"nerf Veigar.
