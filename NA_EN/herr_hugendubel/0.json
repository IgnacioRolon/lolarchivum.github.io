I was arguing with a few players on my team and that apparently got me permabanned, as I was reported and punished already before. I don&#039;t really understand the politics behind the punishment on lol, though. It appears to me that you can play as shitty as you want, even intentionally and as soon as someone points that out, you can report him and he gets banned.\r\nI will show you the following example in which I probably could have just stopped arguing, but I do not understand why people play ranked if they do not want to win and just fuck around. I wouldn&#039;t mind that on normals, but I think ranked is supposed to be taken a bit more serious..\r\n\r\nSo I was toplaning as teemo vs Illaoi and the midlaner was fizz playing against bard. Fizz was constantly leaving mid to roam, but didnt actually get anything out of it, while bard used the opportunity to get kills and take the whole mid lane. Fizz came top a couple of times, which was not helping me a bit at that point, especially since he also came right after I recalled, took my cs and froze the lane and the opponents turrets. And as Bard&#039;s roams more or less destroyed our botlane I told fizz to stay mid. He refused to do so for the majority of the game (he always said ok, though), which eventually cost us the whole game as they essentially got  a free lane.\r\nHere is the chatlog that got me reported (so you only see me talking):\r\n\r\nHerr Hugendubel: wow illaoi must be blind\r\nHerr Hugendubel: yeah welll.. fizz is also blind\r\nHerr Hugendubel: it is lee sin commemoration week\r\nHerr Hugendubel: HAHAHA\r\nHerr Hugendubel: fizz u need to pressure if bard roams so much\r\nHerr Hugendubel: gj\r\nHerr Hugendubel: 2 for 1\r\nHerr Hugendubel: and lane resets\r\nHerr Hugendubel: u really need to get the turret, fizz\r\nHerr Hugendubel: stop getting my cs top\r\nHerr Hugendubel: get mid\r\nHerr Hugendubel: fizz u ar eawful\r\nHerr Hugendubel: if u had done the minimum mid we would have had first blood turret\r\nHerr Hugendubel: u might not get it but ur roaming kills us\r\nHerr Hugendubel: go mid\r\nHerr Hugendubel: i am good on top\r\nHerr Hugendubel: fizz if u continue to leavemid i go afk\r\nHerr Hugendubel: u lose the game\r\nHerr Hugendubel: for all of us\r\nHerr Hugendubel: it is not good , it shows that you have no clue\r\nHerr Hugendubel: bard roams and gets turrets\r\nHerr Hugendubel: u get noghting so far\r\nHerr Hugendubel: he lost mid turret although i asked him to stay mid an dpush\r\nHerr Hugendubel: and meanwhile bard is roaming all over the map\r\nHerr Hugendubel: bc fizz makes no pressure\r\nHerr Hugendubel: im done\r\nHerr Hugendubel: he threw the game from the stary\r\nHerr Hugendubel: stay mid and push ur alne\r\nHerr Hugendubel: do NOT come\r\nHerr Hugendubel: stay in ur alne\r\nHerr Hugendubel: STAY MID\r\nHerr Hugendubel: STAY MID\r\nHerr Hugendubel: FIZZ STOP THROWING\r\nHerr Hugendubel: great job\r\nHerr Hugendubel: u could have not thrown mid the whoile time and listened\r\nHerr Hugendubel: i won top and u all run top ha;f the time\r\nHerr Hugendubel: bard killed everyone bc of the retarded fizz\r\nHerr Hugendubel: who would always say ok, but never do what i asked\r\nHerr Hugendubel: now mid is lost and they won the game\r\nHerr Hugendubel: if u would listen we would\r\nHerr Hugendubel: fizz go mid and stay there\r\nHerr Hugendubel: u throw and threow\r\nHerr Hugendubel: yeah you suck anyways, fizz\r\nHerr Hugendubel: swear in vietnamese all u like\r\n\r\nSo, what is your take on this? I personally believe that punishing for saying stuff isnt reasonable at all, as you can always mute someone, while playing intentionally against the team is almost never banned, bc it is simply much harder to prove. But if someone gets angry, bc his teammate steals his cs, his buffs, etc and then says something, I think it shouldn&#039;t be the guy who said something to get punished, but rather the guy who intentionally set his teammate back.

I personally believe that punishing for saying stuff isnt reasonable at all, as you can always mute someone, while playing intentionally against the team is almost never banned, bc it is simply much harder to prove.\n\nMy take is that this doesn't sound intentional: it sounds like a Fizz who isn't good at roaming and didn't want you to boss him around. Further, the mute button is like a shield: it exists to help you protect against toxicity, but that's no excuse for attacking someone. So yes, the person being toxic with language should be punished, as, yes, should someone INTENTIONALLY throwing the game. It doesn't seem like Fizz necessarily was.\n\n>I think it shouldn't be the guy who said something to get punished, but rather the guy who intentionally set his teammate back.
