I have multiple medium end systems and they're all doing this, most have 1050's or 750ti's,  and I've even seen high end rigs drop half or more of their fps at the end of the game, it makes it practically unplayable for most of the rigs I'm on.  What's actually going on besides just the shear number of effects I assume dropping the frames, is there any way to get rid of these effects?  I really dont need the extra light effects for instance that are showing me that we have baron, if it will bring my fps back up to 140+ which it is at the start of the game especially.\n\nIt feels like i'm walking in sludge, and as currently a warwick main it effects how i can hit my ult especially. \n\nyes i already have all my settings turned all the way down, i've followed all the guides, and multiple youtube videos on how to fix the problem, and even looked into installing wooxy, but it kind of is sketchy now since it's no longer supported.

If those frame drops only happen towards the end of the match, it's likely happening from all the effects happening as well as more of the map being uncovered. The more map vision you have, the more assets need to be loaded all at once which could slow down your system. Try turning down some of the settings if you haven't yet, as well as checking for the WIndows Game DVR. It's been known to cause a lot of FPS issues as well, so make sure that's still turned off.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hatta","date":"2017-11-21T07:17:05.182+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This happens if I'm on the losing side as well, with no vision of the map.  It's definitely related to when the super minions spawn and how many it has to render and if the baron is taken, and just the sheer amount of effects going on at the end of the game and the amount of rendering that has to happen.   Also even the effects of the dragon seem to severely lower fps at the end game.   I can't turn my settings any lower in game than I already have, and I still get around 25 fps at the end of the game on my main system with a 1050ti.  It's over 180fps at the beginning.","replies":[{"poster":"ccam0498","date":"2017-11-21T12:39:29.272+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i've noticed more recently (past 3 days) about 30 mins into the game my fps drop from 50 to 5 and constantly sit around 5 - 10 till i leave the game and restart it which leaves it around 20 makes it very hard to play as im a yasuo player so with the sheer lag from the fps drop i can't do anything but just stand there","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TheDeadsh0t","date":"2017-11-21T01:40:32.705+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if i had to take a guess, it sounds like you are pinning your cpu","replies":[]}]}
