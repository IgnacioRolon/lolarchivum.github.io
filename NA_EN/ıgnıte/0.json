Please check the logs for more information.","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ever since patch 7.3 my friend hasn't been able to play league. Originally she patched, tried to join a game but league would crash then would proceed to update again. We have tried several things to try and fix it. It got to the point where I told her to uninstall league and tried reinstalling it and even that didn't help. She keeps getting the \"Unspecified error occurred. Please check the logs for more information.\" I told her to try using the Hextech Repair Tool to force a repatch and I also told her to use it to try and reinstall (even a clean install). She does have issues with space on her laptop and decided to do a clean reboot and then try again, but she gets the same error whether she tries to install legacy or alpha.\r\n\r\nI checked the boards a bit and saw someone else has been having the same issues, however the only comment was from Grumbles stating that one thing that causes this issue is when someone modifies their client info to play in a different language. I know for a fact she has not (she only speaks English and I still made her check her locale.cfg file under RADS to be sure.)\r\n\r\nHopefully I've provided enough information. I told her to post for help however for some reason it tell's her  she has to be level 12 or above, which she is, to post a discussion. If there's any other information needed I will do my best to provide what I can and relay what is said to her.\r\n\r\n-Thanks in advance ^^","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-08T23:38:57.392+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the info, though I need one more piece of info to help your friend.
