Dyrus wouldnt peel for his team and instead ult olaf. Lust boy Would save his exhaust and ultimate, run away and watch his team die....I can't even recall when Lustboy actually ulted. Lustboy was leaving up to his meme....you sure as hell couldn't see him in a team fight, hed just flash over a wall or run away from a team fight. Lust boy would have been better as Tahm kench all he was doing was casting an E on his team mates.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Best Garen BR","date":"2015-10-10T11:40:49.249+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"OG will lose to SKT anyway\nbut for now..\nget fistfucked TSM","replies":[{"poster":"Maszii","date":"2015-10-10T14:09:18.565+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Best Garen BR,realm=EUW,application-id=9hBQwnEU,discussion-id=L1wrEZor,comment-id=0008,timestamp=2015-10-10T11:40:49.249+0000)\n>\n> OG will lose to SKT anyway\n> but for now..\n> get fistfucked TSM\n\nWhy would they be matched up with SKT?
