However, I can&#039;t help but feel when I&#039;m playing him that he&#039;d work a lot better as a melee champion. \nFacts: \n-He currently has the lowest range of any ranged champion.\n-The animation for his auto attack is him hitting enemies with his tail (he doesn&#039;t throw anything).\n-Melee champions that enhance their auto attacks (Wukong, Illaoi, etc.) have a longer range than him.\nSwitching this would allow him to make better use of some of his most common items, like Knight&#039;s Vow. It would also give him the option to use Relic Shield. While Ancient Coin would probably still generate more gold, one of Rakan&#039;s strengths is lane sustain (from his Q and E) and this would help enhance that. \nRakan usually sits around the middle of support tier lists, and I think that this change would act more as a quality of life change, and not make him overpowered. With the Quest for the Relic Shield line being removed, Riot no longer has to worry about him shield stacking.","replies":[{"poster":"skysire","date":"2018-03-29T14:20:57.586+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"even if they nerfed hie range a bit and then called it melee that would be fine like he shouldnft count as a ranged champion","replies":[]},{"poster":"VexJebus","date":"2018-03-13T16:00:07.597+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah.. how about we nerf the champs with overloaded kits, not encourage them.","replies":[{"poster":"skysire","date":"2018-03-29T14:19:48.910+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol someone dosent like lee sin","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Peritheus","date":"2018-02-26T23:52:19.881+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rakans.... ranged????? wut","replies":[{"poster":"RenownedWheat42","date":"2018-02-26T23:53:55.668+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, he's considered ranged.","replies":[]}]}]}
