When I started rapidly clicking answers to try to go fast just to check for more icons, I clicked on multiple ones per question before it went to the next screen. After you do this, when you restart there will appear to be multiples of the test and you can select all the answers without anything changing on screen. Even so, clicking these enough will end the test and will just repeat the glitch again.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-10-10T16:18:40.149+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As Last Master said, there is only one Star Guardian icon to obtain, but you're welcome to take the quiz as many times as you'd like. :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"geky√πme","date":"2016-10-10T01:11:57.684+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"there's only one icon. no matter what star guardian you are you get the same icon as everyone else.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ozzie Storm","date":"2016-10-09T17:19:33.560+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are there multiple icons?","replies":[]}]}
