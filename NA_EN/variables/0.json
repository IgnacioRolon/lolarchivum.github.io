I can't see desktop, nor taskbar... I really like borderless fullscreen, but this is such a pain I can no longer use it.\r\n\r\nI am unsure if the latest november windows update caused it, because I am on-and-off player, but it is likely.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-11T18:37:48.449+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The recent Windows 10 may have caused this, in fact!  The recent update auto-enabled the [Xbox Game Bar](http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8637-game-bar-turn-off-windows-10-a.html) which has been causing this exact kind of freezing for some players.
