It takes a trend of disconnections before you will see a penalty, and if you're continuously disconnecting, I'd recommend investigating into the reason why they're happening.\n\nIn this instance, we know that your game files were corrupted. The client likely made you run a repair, so if this issue happens again, you'll likely want to complete a clean reinstallation of League.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]}]}
