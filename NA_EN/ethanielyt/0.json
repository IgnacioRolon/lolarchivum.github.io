The patcher got stuck on 80% its currently on step 2.  I have dealt with this before but it was at 33% and I'm not sure that way would work. Someone, please help. I just want to play League man.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-22T22:50:49.586+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"During this period, the patcher is trying to download new files but your network is somehow being blocked or unable to establish a connection to our patcher servers.  My recommendation would be to review our [connection issues ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues)guide, and go over the steps provided to get this fixed up.  If you continue to have an issue afterwards, though, hit me up and we can dig deeper.","replies":[{"poster":"EthanielYT","date":"2016-08-24T17:18:18.316+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, I have fixed this.
