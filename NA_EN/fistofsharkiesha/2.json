She's mobile enough to avoid some focus, and Zhonya's is what makes her absolutely overpowered in teamfights. Every other good teamfighting, high burst champion has some fatal flaw. Huge mana costs or cooldown, no mobility, etc. Her passive needs a cap or shrinking effect. There's no reason we should lose the game after having a huge lead just because Katarina swoops in and feeds after she had been outplayed the entire game. This season even encourages teamfights so you either ban Katarina or lose every important objective because she's waiting to get a pentakill.\n\nDon't touch her AP ratios, don't touch her 1v1 capabilities. Do something about her ability to pentakill in a matter of seconds. There are 2 items that allow her to cheat death, and on top of that she has shunpo.","replies":[{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2015-01-26T01:11:50.291+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"She's currently being fixed. Her main issue was the fact that her Shunpo did damage and there was no counterplay to that damage. It's being removed and her Q and W are being slightly buffed to compensate, but because her E doesn't do damage, she has to land her W after she E's in to do damage, so she can be quickly CC'd. The removal of DFG is also going to fix her incredibly nice. Now, her weakness to CC is actually existent now that she has to use her R. \n\nMost consider her nerf a bit over board since her R can be stopped by CC, but because of the buff she got a while back that everyone seems to forget about, her R does damage initially and will do some decent damage since it ticks for 25% of her AP with each dagger and she shoots 10 daggers max at one champion, up to 3 champions. she does this over 2.5s and it does start as soon as it's pressed, so this means she shoots up 1 dagger per .25s. Most CC's take a second, to hit, so a quick reflexes Kat can still put out 100% of her AP. We will miss the raw stats of DFG though. CDR really helps early one because of her long CD's prior to a kill, plus the huge boost to AP. I think we'll survive though, but obviously won't be as prominent now since she can't DFG+Q+E+W a squishy and then move onto the next one and press Zhonya's when she's about to be stunned, etc. etc.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kuroi86","date":"2015-01-25T23:26:47.950+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://www.surrenderat20.net/","replies":[]},{"poster":"ThunderDad","date":"2015-01-25T23:04:46.975+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Already being tested for a nerf on pbe","replies":[]}]}
