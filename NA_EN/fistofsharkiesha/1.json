Now the two problem items, devourer and cinderhulk have both been heavily nerfed. \n\nTime to revert these nerfs.\n\n{{champion:10}}  5 AD removed because of her jungling power. Devourer itself is nerfed, in addition to ranged champions being less effective with devourer. Not only is she back to being a mediocre jungle pick that takes 20 minutes to have the slightest effect on the game, now lane Kayle is 5 AD weaker. \n\n{{champion:14}}  Too many nerfs to fit on this page...\n{{champion:113}} Massive flail of the northern winds nerfs. \n\nI may be missing some, feel free to comment about it. Don&#039;t let Riot continue their trend of nerfing the fuck out of champions because of OP items, later nerfing the items, and leaving the champions they nerfed in the dust. \n\nUnrelated to the devourer and cinderhulk nerfs, but {{champion:9}}  has been suffering since the removal of magus, he doesn&#039;t have any use for runeglaive at all. Maybe revert his 700-650 tether range nerf if you aren&#039;t going to give us better AP machete options.","replies":[{"poster":"3tyson","date":"2015-10-23T15:53:17.969+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I sril claim magnus was also better for nid\n\nSej use to do dmg\nnow she can just cc u","replies":[{"poster":"Wulf Helhammer","date":"2015-10-23T16:18:53.585+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Build a liandry's and tanky.
