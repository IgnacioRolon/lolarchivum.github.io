It&#039;s not a gold efficient item and I don&#039;t have a huge incentive to pay for it&#039;s completion unless I really, really value that active. It's great on champions like Heimerdinger and Swain, and against champions like Zed, but it's simply not reliably worth that much. There are plenty of cases where you don't want to use the active, and you lose the trade because you're basically just missing 1,000 gold in your build. On the other hand, Maw's passive is ALWAYS useful. It protects you from death in ways far better than guardian angel or Zhonya's, and is extremely gold efficient while doing so. Also, it's quite easy to play around Zhonya's active. If you're inhibited by a stun, silence, or knockup, you can't use the active to save yourself. Most champions which could have most of their damage countered by stasis such as Syndra, Annie, Cho'gath, etc have CC which allows them to completely prevent the active.\n\nSo if you think it&#039;s okay and refuse to un-nerf/rework it, okay, but at least give us other options. Maw of Malmortius is making the game an absolute nightmare for mages. Your enemy laner can just buy a hexdrinker and win by virtue of having an extremely powerful item, no matter how ahead you are. AD champions have 2 extremely strong and gold efficient anti-AP items {{item:3139}} {{item:3156}}  while AP champions get an 87% gold efficient items which freezes them in place, allowing enemies to catch up or their abilities to go off cooldown. \n\nThis isn&#039;t a thread about Zhonya&#039;s, it about AP champions not having any good anti-AD options while anti-AP items are some of the most gold efficient and strongest items in the entire game.

It'll stop Zed from killing you with ult, but if you're squishy he has no trouble staying for another half second to WEQ-auto you and kill you anyway. The MR isn't going to save you from that, or Pantheon/Irelia for that matter. Consider, though, having this against {{champion:45}} and QSSing his stun, thus avoiding the burst from his W and making it a LOT harder for him to kill you just off that alone. He can kill you with QR only if it's late game and he's got the AP and the magic pen for it.

How would you use this defensively, unless the raw stats were enough??? I know these were just examples, but my point stands that debuffing a champion for using a shield active similar to maw is a horrible idea.\n\nComparably, you could look at Seraph's embrace... I guess a debuff would make sense if it just takes away something that the item offers already; Seraph's grants you a shit-ton of mana, but to defend yourself you have to let this item eat a chunk of your remaining mana, effectively negating its mana benefit, but proving a huge defensive bonus. That's balanced. I guess if the mage version would give you CDR (don't give me shit about managing CDR, because Assassins get Warlord's bloodlust, and Mercurial Scimitar gives them tons of lifesteal, meaning trading damage with them is pointless half the time) and then the active shield would zero out your cdr and give you a sheild based on CDR... still would suck, but there would be something precedent to look at, if you needed to \"balance it.\"\n\nMakes for interesting thought on how you could debuff Maw to make it less oppressive to  mages.  I get that all classes need an item to protect from other classes that you could use to keep from having a bad matchup meaning game from champ select. But Maw just makes assassins too tanky to kill, and gives them damage  on top of the damage they already get from BF sword being so damn cheap... hell , this applies to Hexdrinker too.

The opposite, however, is true. AP mages need the active to survive a full combo from these AD assassins after they build pretty much any item and hit level 6. There is no other option for AP mids, and, again, no AP mid wants to build Zhonia's right now, because the stats are crap. You pay 1050 gold for the active and 5 AP more than the build path.\n\nMeanwhile, assassins at least can choose between Maw or Mercurial Scimitar. What you're talking about is counterplay. You build Maw because it makes your lane easier and gives you a higher chance to win, but the same can be said of Hexdrinker because it does pretty much the same thing.  You get more than enough useful stats out of Maw than Mages get out of Zhonia's.\n\nMaw gives you more magic resist than Zhonia's gives armor, you get a bunch of AD (~20 less ad than items that give the maximum ad in the game) and armor pen. Zhonia's gives 80 AP, 40 less than it used to, and 40 less than the item that gives the most AP in the game, and has no spell pen. You should want to build Maw in every game, because as long as the enemy team isn't bad, they'll have a comp with some magic damage in it.","replies":[{"poster":"WadeWilson1337","date":"2016-03-16T16:00:29.775+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just played a game with a {{champion:134}} mid vs a {{champion:92}}. Of course the Syndra had to rush a {{item:3157}} in that matchup to not get murdered, and she actually didnt feed and did fair in that lane. The issue however was she had no mana items because of her zhonyas, and every, single, time, she tried to roam or we tried to gank, she had no mana. Its just unfair that ADs dont have to build a mana item so there is absolutely no drawbacks to building defensive, whereas with APs it is basically sacrificing the possibility of winning lane by going defensive.","replies":[{"poster":"DeloricVI","date":"2016-03-16T16:13:56.004+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Another big flaw. Most assassins either have energy (which regenerates very quickly, and is much easier to manage than mana) or don't need to use a lot of mana, except when they full-burst you down, after which they don't need mana to harass you anymore, because you're fucking dead!\n\nThis is exactly the kind of shit that the Riot balance team needs to consider, because they seriously don't have a good concept of how these matchups go. Against AD assassins, the game has officially become this for mages:\n\n-Impossible to roam from the mid lane\n-Will always be mana-starved\n-Will have to hug tower all game, even after Zhonia's is complete\n-Farming is going to suck because Assassin's harass usually either leads to their main combo to destroy you, or gets you painfully low\n-Locking into one item build for the first... half of the game, just about\n-No one can gank for you, unless it's a 2-man  gank\n\nYeah, seems fair. Make them suffer for those seasons where they were either overpowered or just kind of dominant.
