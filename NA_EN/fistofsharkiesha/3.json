Due to her passive and her E ap ratio, it is waaay more beneficial to stack as much AP as you possibly can. During late game, her E will be the burst dmg and will kill carries / squishy champs with few E spams, usually within couple of seconds.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=FistOfSharkiesha,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=EktwmMub,comment-id=,timestamp=2015-06-08T01:18:18.940+0000)\n>\n>She can be built off tank or full tank and I believe both are better than glass cannon.\n\nNope, she would pretty much suck then... since her dmg would be minimal or at least waaay less than what the opposing APC has.","replies":[{"poster":"FistOfSharkiesha","date":"2015-06-08T09:06:58.121+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Um it's called itemizing?

It also gets stronger the less Cc your team has. And Rylai's wreck's Melee laners.\nCatalyst is pretty good vs Poke mages. The psuedo-sustain is much more useful when you have 5+ seconds to proc it. And Twin Fangs single handedly outscales most mages, similar to how Karthus works.\n\nArchangle's usually better then chalice in general. Cassiopeia really wasn't designed to work with Mana regen. You're gonna be spending (50 / 60 / 70 / 80 / 90) 100/120/140/160/180 mana/second, whereas Athene's restores... nothing even close to that. Athene's is just a desperation move against Harsh lane Bullies. If you're not comfortable against the champion you're laning against, build Chalice > Negatrons into athene's + abyssal. Otherwise, just go Tear > Giant's belt/Catalyst.\n\nSo A typical full build would probably look something like;\n{{item:3003}} + {{item:3116}}/{{item:3027}} + {{item:3001}}/{{item:3110}}/{{item:3157}}/{{item:3102}}/{{item:3065}} depending on the enemy team.
