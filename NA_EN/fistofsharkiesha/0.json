Basically I'm arguing that Diana exists to do Kassadin's job way more reliably and other than his (now very short) blink, Kassadin doesn't have much unique to him.

I think Kassadin has room for a buff. He has a very weak laning phase and he's easily replaced by Akali or Diana, Diana being one of the highest winrate mage/assassins in the game, for obvious reasons. \n\nIf other champions have access to very similar abilities (Annie's W comes to mind) that are as strong or stronger, with similar cooldowns, I just don't see the need for the charge system. His slow is harsh, but it's just for 1 second and after the Rylai's rework nearly any mage can permaslow, making it even less valuable as an ability. \n\nHaving an ability gated by mana, a charge system, and a cooldown is odd. Maybe 2 of those 3 things would be fine, but it just seems like overkill, especially on a champion that has been considered weak for quite some time now. He has room for buffs and this would be one place to start. His Q and W are in a really good place right now, so I would personally look to buff/rework his E, R, or even his passive. Being an \"anti-mage\" without scaling MR just makes it like his passive is making up for a weakness he shouldn't have. Even AD assassins get scaling MR and Kassadin doesn't.\n\nSorry if I'm being redundant but my point is Kass doesn't have the most amazing abilities so it makes no sense to me why one of them has an unnecessary requirement. Other champions have better abilities and do his job more efficiently. You're better off assassinating people with Annie's monstrous AP ratios now that Kassadin's blink barely takes you anywhere.

Requiring X number of spell casts to use fits pretty well thematically and should be kept, but that, in combination with a mana cost, is plenty of gating on the ability. The cooldown is redundant and makes it so the use case you mentioned (limited use in a 1v1 scenario, boosted use during a team fight) because in a team fight, you could have the charges refreshed almost instantly and it makes no difference because he has to wait another 5 seconds to use it anyway. Abilities with non-fixed cooldowns (like Shyvana's ult, or any ability who's cooldown reduces for AAing like Master Yi's alpha strike) have been proven to work and be balanced in the past, so I think making that shift here for Kassadin would help capture his gameplay identity better than keeping the cooldown and removing the reset.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Khell DarkWolf","date":"2015-09-29T10:09:47.734+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"To be fair, his E should keep the charge system but allow him to use it even with zero charges but have it's power cut into 1/6th of its max power.\n\nBasically each charge increases its usefulness until he reaches 5 charges like normal it does its original live values.

I feel that if it works on a charge system, it should definitely do more than just slow and do very mediocre damage. In fact, I feel like adding some anti-mage mechanic onto it would be very unique and thematically fit him as an anti mage. Something like letting him cast void pulse in its current state any time, however at 6 stacks, perhaps have it do something extra that targets mages whether it be some sort of silence or implement a mechanic where the target does some value of reduced magic damage for like 1-2 seconds, or something of the sort.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Nahui","date":"2015-09-28T16:49:02.617+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":5,"body":"It's to also prevent jungle Kassadin.

With his ult, Kassadin's ganks would simply bypass wards, kind of like Zac, but he would burst when ganking unlike Zac who's there for CC. You would just max his E in the jungle, get CDR, and burn down jungle camps and lanes alike. The charge system makes it so you're not wiping out the jungle.\n\nThat argument doesn't hold as much ground anymore. For one, Kassadin would need level 6 to even think about ganking, and he doesn't have any (health) sustain in the jungle other than Machete. Two, there are already quite a few champions that can bypass the common warding spots -- Rek'Sai, Lee Sin, J4 to a degree -- and not even Kassadin can bypass a completely warded river. Three, Kassadin would either have to wait about a minute for his ult stacks to wear off or spend a sizable chunk of his mana pool to even get into position if he wants to bypass wards; two jumps without waiting is already 150 mana, and the third would be 200, and Kass only has 767 base mana at level 6.\n\nI think it's time to remove the charge system from Kassadin's E. Change the cooldown if it becomes an issue.","replies":[{"poster":"RogueWill","date":"2015-09-29T02:49:36.555+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are quite a lot of champions that ganks pre 6 are awful. {{champion:19}} {{champion:131}} {{champion:107}} yo name a few","replies":[{"poster":"Auz the Ripper","date":"2015-09-29T14:37:15.892+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Eh, Rengar has a easy root and decent lane ganks, I wouldn't say his pre-6 ganks are _awful_","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Hawkefire","date":"2015-09-29T04:53:06.556+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Errr....you mean his little \"hop\" of an ult?
