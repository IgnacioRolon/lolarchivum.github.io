As a one of the few people who main Mordekaiser, I really appreciate the work done on him, the visuals and gameplay looks amazing.\r\nThat being said there are things to improve, and one of the biggest ones at the moment is his W - Indestructible.\r\n\r\nMordekaiser's new W ability _Indestructible_ seems to be nothing more than a glorified 30% max shield.. With the condition you have to charge it. \r\nThe gameplay loop of the ability seems to be to just wait for the shield to charge, pop W, pop it again, and heal using it as a sustain ability. Otherwise the other loop is to just use it as a 30%maxhp shield for combat, but even then it's not good a good shield option because it decays. The 14 seconds cd between uses is a killer too.\r\nIt's quite a shame seeing Mordekaiser's shield reduce to this considering it was one of his fun mechanics. Right not it's just too uninteractive.\r\n\r\nSo a solution to this problem is to make the shield behave in a way that current Morde's _Iron Man_ behaves!\r\nhttps://imgur.com/a450Yl7\r\nThe goal here is to make the active a bit more _engaging_.\r\nSo when Mordekaier activates W, he gets the shield he stored, and during 4 seconds, he can keep adding onto the shield as deals damage.\r\nYou can then pop it for heal if you think you need to during the ability, otherwise when the duration of the W ends, the shield will pop the heal Mordekaiser automatically.\r\nDuring the active however, you'll only receive shields from damage _dealt_ not  _taken_. This would make it so he doesn't get a 4 second damage reduction from the damage taken portion of the passive.\r\n\r\nHonestly that would make it **very** fun to play, and the high CD on W would feel warranted.\r\n\r\n_;And for speculation that changing his W to this would bring back issues with current Mordekaiser - it wouldn't.\r\nConsidering current Mordekaisers shield lasts forever, and this idea wouldn't and lasts for say - 4 seconds - it would make it very healthy._","replies":[{"poster":"ChrisPixel","date":"2019-05-31T03:45:15.726+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its really sad to see how most people are embracing the change to his shield mechanic without considering the fact it changes the feel of the champion completely. The rework was supposed to update his kit without alienating his players, like it happened with Aatrox, but it seems all they did was relocating all his power to the damage he deals and nothing to his sustain in combat. Mordekaiser should be encouraged to be agressive to stay alive even when he is outnumbered. A good idea for his W is that it should sinergize with his passive like the old W did. The shield would only come out for as long as you can mantain your passive on and the active of W could also make your passive burst and heal you for the remaining shield and the amount of enemy champions hit by the burst. Less annoying lane sustain and more fight survivability.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kelg","date":"2019-05-31T01:47:39.319+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"His old shield passive was broken, it needed to go, and bringing it back as an active would be just as broken with this new kit.","replies":[{"poster":"DaCurtis","date":"2019-05-31T01:49:01.362+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"This isn't Mordekaiser's old shield passive..","replies":[{"poster":"Kelg","date":"2019-05-31T01:53:46.435+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=DaCurtis,realm=OCE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=bnx6stIb,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2019-05-31T01:49:01.362+0000)\n>\n> This isn't Mordekaiser's old shield passive..\n\nLetting him add to the shield for 4 seconds is his old passive, and thats over half the duration of death realm.

Having his shield on a CD is not current Mordekaiser and doesn't represent the problems it had. This re-imagining offers so much counterplay with no expense to fun or balance.\n\n>If he builds damage then the enemy can't kill him during ult.\n\nHow? That's like saying, \"If Darius builds damage the enemy can't kill him during ult.

Honestly his new W has quite a bit more skill expression than I knew about when I started typing lol","replies":[]}]}]}]}
