Bug or no??","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","embed":{"description":"Image Sem T tulo3 hosted in imgbb.com","url":"https://ibb.co/hKEkym","image":"https://image.ibb.co/mZrXdm/Sem_T_tulo3.png"},"up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi, I havent played League for roughly almost 2 months because of university work and when I got back, I've had some problems.\r\n\r\nFrom settings magically changed on my PC, to net problems I had to fix, I have had now this annoying inconvenience with the client. \r\n\r\nIdk how bad my net would be, Im rusty and wanted to practice my CS so I entered the Practice Tool and when I Exited the game I noticed something weird:\r\nAfter I Exit the Victory screen, the League Client window shows up but it is minuscule! Really, really small, its only a fragent of what it is supposed to be.\r\nExample: Top Right corner\r\nhttps://ibb.co/dB92dm\r\n\r\nAnd when I Close the Client on the Tool Tab below, it does show the league's \"Yes or No\" message in the same small window that is suppose to be the scoreboard! (it lets me close that way, at least I have that)\r\nExample:\r\nhttps://ibb.co/bLCcB6\r\n\r\nI experimented entering and exiting the Practice tool many times and the same thing happens and ends with me closing the client to Restart it.\r\nI tried a Bots Game VS AI and the same thing happened and so I couldnt honor anyone on my team and didnt chat with them neither seen the scoreboards.\r\nI still hadnt played Normals and I predict the same would happen. Im happy I can still play but this inconvenience to leave the client after every single game is annoying.\r\n\r\nI did a Full Repair and it didnt solve my problem. Maybe Unistall and ReInstall the game might help?\r\nAny help would be appreciated. I fail to see what I am missing here.\r\nHas this happened to any1 before?\r\n\r\nLifelessAngel","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-02-01T22:13:33.884+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ayyyy I'm glad you found an older article which worked for you before I had the time to get back to work!
