But I duo'd with a friend who was in low priority que and after that I suddenly am. It told me she was for dodging to many, so I don't know why I am though.

You can also get a lower priority queue if you keep declining matches as well, or if you are queued with another player who had a lower priority queue.","replies":[]},{"poster":"VinceDaGr3at","date":"2017-08-31T14:56:36.258+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also it didnt show when I duod with someone else and im getting in games fast.
