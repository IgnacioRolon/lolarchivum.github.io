I would recommend looking into other network use, and possibly running a trace route command to Riot's network to see where your issues are -- my suspicion is that the issue isn't at their end, but it might not be at yours either.","replies":[{"poster":"TheCodeisCupCake","date":"2018-06-05T20:32:01.367+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=The Djinn,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=mVd1EVrv,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-06-05T19:30:14.428+0000)\n>\n>  running a trace route command to Riot&#x27;s network to see where your issues are\n\nThanks ill try it out.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2018-06-05T20:29:57.364+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"you probably should sumbit to https://support.riotgames.com and ask for technical support.\n\nI've had a friend who've had similar issues before.

I will be willing to bet you are playing on WiFi which will answer the ping question. \n\nhttps://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/page/ethernet-vs-wifi-ping-packets-playing-better\n\nDon't give me the I can't use ethernet because I have two 50 footers and a splicer if needed. I'm sorry but gaming on Wifi is not very smart to do in this game when sudden lag could really screw you over. Those lucky enough to have good Wifi won't see as many spikes but trust me, they will from time to time and if they tell you they don't then they are full of shit.\n\nPlug in and most of your issues will go away.","replies":[{"poster":"TheCodeisCupCake","date":"2018-06-05T20:31:10.721+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Im playing on a laptop as my PC is getting fixed, I should get it back in a couple days but the tech guys are being lazy fucks.
