This was such a hype game mode for them to create, and the fact that they said it could possibly be permanent really makes me want to hear more from riot about what they plan to do. This was one of the most fresh game modes I have played in league of legends. It changes the gameplay so perfectly and is a good game mode to play when you are feeling tilted. Aram just isn&rsquo;t the same. I can play nexus blitz to win, or I can play it to mess around. I really would enjoy if riot gave us updates on whether this mode will come back as a RGM, permanent, or just not at all.\n\nThanks","replies":[]}
