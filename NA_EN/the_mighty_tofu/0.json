I patched the game and went into a custom, because I was gonna wait for a friend. I got the \"unable to connect to the server\" message a couple of times, but I kept retrying and managed to get into the loading screen, and the game afterwards. I was getting a lot of lag spikes, so I logged off, shut down my laptop, and went to bed.\r\n\r\nToday, I can't even connect after multiple tries. I ran the connection troubleshoot, but the problem seems to be with either my ISP or my local network because I turned on the mobile hotspot function on my phone to connect and it worked perfectly. Right now, my wifi won't even connect to the network by itself, so I have to use an external USB wifi adapter to manage to connect.\r\n\r\nI restarted my router and modem, but it didn't work at all. I assumed it was my laptop's wifi that could've broken down, but even now that I manage to connect with the external adapter, it still won't load League. I tried Riot's Troubleshooting Connection Issues article, and set the public DNS like it said, and that's when my laptop's wifi stopped connecting to my router.\r\n\r\nI decided to check the boards to see if someone else was having this issue before blaming my ISP, but seems like some other players are getting this problem too.\r\n\r\n1. ISP (Internet Service Provider): Cable Onda.\r\n2. Region: Panama City, Panama, Central America.\r\n3. I did check the Troubleshooting Connection Issues article and the only thing that I hadn't done ended up bugging my wifi. I actually find that weird, because that DNS thing usually doesn't bug my wifi like that.\r\n4. When did the issue start? Last night, after patching the game.\r\n5. How often does this issue occur? Every game. Can't play at all without my phone's mobile data.\r\n6. I'd attach my tracert to the NA servers, but I don't know how.\r\n7. The client works perfect and smooth. No connection issues at landing page, profile, shop, anything; the only problem lies after the champion select. All other games and programs I use connect perfectly to the internet.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-07-31T18:55:59.651+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Based on your description and the fact you can enter games while on your hotspot connection, it definitely sounds like your issue lies in your local or ISP's network. I'd like you to try bypassing your wireless router, in case it's contributing to your connection errors. Try a wired (Ethernet) connection directly to your modem, bypassing your router entirely. \n\nLet me know if this causes any change.","replies":[{"poster":"The Mighty Tofu","date":"2016-08-03T01:51:45.196+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Targons Blade,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=ZTE4EhfA,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-07-31T18:55:59.651+0000)\n>\n> Based on your description and the fact you can enter games while on your hotspot connection, it definitely sounds like your issue lies in your local or ISP&#x27;s network.

Before going wired, I tried playing and it worked great.\n\nNot sure if it was a game issue, or my ISP happened to fix at the same time as the game patch.\n\nThanks for your help.","replies":[]}]}]}
