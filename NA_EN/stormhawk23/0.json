In fact getting new ones is next to impossible for someone like me. I am what many would call a filthy casual who should get the hell out of their game and let only the pros play. But the problem is i tend to ignore those people quite often. I've played this game and loved it but i feel like i cant try any new heroes. I don't have the funds, there's no trial mode for a hero, and Quiet frankly i am both unwilling and unable to fork over the cash you're asking me to riot. I want to enjoy this game as much as the next guy, but i shouldn't have to grind for weeks upon months to get a new hero. In a game about trying new heroes and pitting them against other heroes, i don't want to feel obligated to either grind my life away, or to spend more money than i have to to get {{champion:203}}, or {{champion:429}}, Or even older champions like {{champion:57}} or {{champion:201}}. If you want a dedicated fan base, then that is great. But if you want a wider fan base, to increase that lovely Number of people who can get into your game and fork over even more cash, make the main aspect more accessible to the casual player. I say this because i love this game as much as anyone else. Please, im begging you, make it more accessible to someone like me.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-09T04:56:50.002+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Psssshhhhh whoever said casual was a bad thing?? \n\nYour particular case is the exact reason why we have weekly [**free champions**](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/champions-skins/free-rotation) you can try. We change the list of rotating free champions every week, that way everyone gets a chance to play with many different champions. You might not have them permanently, but it's a great time to do precisely what you're wanting to do: try out new champions. \n\nWe also recently introduced a new practice tool, which allows you to fiddle around with a champion mechanics outside of real matches and completely on your own.","replies":[{"poster":"Stormhawk23","date":"2017-05-13T01:48:33.526+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alright, i give the whole IP cost. Xenos handled that for you. But i still believe that hero costs shouldn't be static. older heroes like Darius or Vel'Koz shouldn't be as expensive as Xayah and Rahkaan. and its not like i can try a hero i don't own already. How will i know that the 6750 IP i just spent was actually worth it if i haven't been able to try a hero outside the rotation. Maybe i'm just complaining but... i feel like you guys focus so much on the game and the numbers and the abilities that you forget the UI of the client and hows it can feel being a player trying to go through it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Xenos von Faneli","date":"2017-05-09T10:21:36.256+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"With first win of the day you get around 225 ip per day with one win, that's 900 every 4 days, in a month you get and easy 6750 (assuming you only play and win one game a day), which buys you any one champ at only an hour of play daily.
