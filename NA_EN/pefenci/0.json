Since one patch it was change to that it still knocks up even if Blitzcrank is blinded. \nBut it seems like they made the ability to a 100% hit when being cast and the aa animation has begun u cant evade it anymore.\nSo i was playing fizz and besides fizz being completly op getting s nearly every game with him 1 Blitzcrank completly countered me the whole game.\n\nNormally when using fizz&acute;s E you get untargetable. I know that there is a little window that fizz can still get damaged right at the beginning of the animation and that he still gets dmg from ignite or Zed ult for example when casted before but in this case it is completly unlogic. \nWhen i used my e skill he knocked me up and i got targetable again. The first time I thought ok maybe a bug or maybe he just had the right timing. But after dozens of times that this happend i was completly sure that this is either intended which i dont think it is or a bug since he also knocked me up while i was already on the pole and ready to fall down. So he wanted to e me and when i wanted to dodge it his animation just did not get canceled and he just walk up and hit me while i was about to fall down  making me targetable again and negate my whole dmg.\nSo this completly screwed me up and was gamechanging it wasnt ranked but it is still annoying.\nIve have never seen any other skill or auto attack that i could not cancel with the right timing but this was undodgeable when he targeted me once.\nFor example any aa gets canceled, cait ult , garen ult , even zed ult with right timing basicly every target ability.\nAnother example woulg be with alistar when he charges at you. He targeted you he already used his skill but with the right timing you can just dodge it and he just charges to your position.\nAnd i also dont think that it is just a problem related to fizz. Probably it also bugs out Vlad or maybe even kalista ult or yiÂ´s alpha strike, Maokai ? Kled when he jumps of his animal ?\nSo this seems like a gamebreaking issue to me and needs to gets fixed because this completly threw me out of the game like he just took me and made me useless one of the champs i am extremly good with and who is completly op and who could probably use some nerfs but ... he still destroyed me with this.\n\nEdit : I tested it out for a few champs. Thanks to x8MadMen8x for helping me out.\n\nFizz -  His E skill still makes dmg but he gets knocked up and receives dmg and is also targetable again. I was probably dead before the E was able to do dmg so thats why i thought it would get negated.\n\nVlad - Gets knocked up gets the dmg but stays in his pool for the rest of the duration\n\nMaokai - If timed right he gets knocked up midway receives dmg and his root gets completly negatet no root no dmg.\n\nZhonyas - The animation still goes of he tries to hit his target but the unvurnable part of zhonyas negates everything it but the untargetable part still gets ignored \n\nBlitz - It only happens when he started the attack animation but doesnt metter where or in which state the enemy is if the attack animation has started you get knocked up and receive the dmg.\n\ni have found this video which just shows the bug the only thing to add is that sometimes its more extrem than in this video where vlad is already completly in his pool or fizz standing already on his pole but still get knocked up.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTA-lx-Nkrc   \n(This Video is not from me !)","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Exgeniar","date":"2016-08-29T05:35:37.007+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Functionally it is working as intended, but not as expected (small edge case of its design). Blitz's E locks on a target when the attack winds up and will always hit (even if you flash it or go untargetable). I don't expect us to change this interaction / behavior anytime soon unless we make sweeping changes to how target acquisition and untargetability work as a system.","replies":[{"poster":"Pefenci","date":"2016-08-29T21:45:09.477+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"As far as I know it is the only ability that works like this while every auto attack or abilty from other champs get canceled with the right timing. \nSo i am asking myself why making this one exception where it works like this without mentioning.","replies":[]}]}]}
