They don't care. You and me and so many others are being faced with craptastic cut and dry cookie cutting responses from this lackluster careless support team employed by RIOT. They have been trained to do so as evidence by the same responses they tell everyone. It is like listening to a telemarketer. Doesn't matter who they call, it is always the same generic response. Same is true here. Doesn't matter who has the problem. Riot has the same response.  Read through the forums, you will see what I mean. Broporo or some other person will link you the connection setup crap and imply this has nothing to do with RIOT but everything to do with you and your connection or windows or computer in general.","replies":[{"poster":"Xaeros","date":"2017-11-10T03:13:18.465+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"You can look through Broporo's (picking on them since they're already in this thread) [post history](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/player/NA/Broporo) and see that they're not just spamming boilerplate messages.\n\nIs there something you'd rather see posted beyond the relevant help material if the cause really is out of Riot's control? Or is the assumption that Riot is definitely at-fault and just being negligent?","replies":[{"poster":"greenlightgo22","date":"2017-11-10T03:23:33.287+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Honestly, it is RIOT being negligent in my opinion. You have multiple threads being posted since last patch with a multitude of issues. Look, I get testing things to see if they work or not. But, if you have a school looking to test its students in a pen and paper format but there is suddenly no more paper on which to prints said tests, how then do you test? My point is telling me to test things in game will only work if I can get into an actual game. I had absolutely no problem doing anything. No problem until the last patch. Somewhere in that little bundle of joy is an actual bug. So yes, repeating the same thing and cookie cutting things is not being genuine in concern for correcting the problem. A problem that exists with more than just one person.  You trying to C your way between A and B is not doing anything to help matters. I can assure you. Thanks, though. :)","replies":[{"poster":"Xaeros","date":"2017-11-10T03:38:18.256+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fair enough. Keep in mind that a ticket is probably the best way to get 1-on-1 help digging deep into a single issue. I know not every Red poster is an engineer, so I'm sure they're just trying to get people to the quickest resolution within their power to grant. \n\nHopefully whatever issue is plaguing you gets taken care of ASAP, it sucks when things aren't working :(","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-10T03:16:52.134+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Always love a shoutout XD! I know you're concerned about us linking guides, but the only reason we use that guide so often is that it actually covers all of the basic troubleshooting steps we'd give you here anyways. It's a lot more time efficient to link a guide you can freely reference, than make everyone come to a single post for the troubleshooting steps. \n\nI always try to end my comments on this note, but if our steps don't help *please* come back and let us know. We never expect a single thing to solve all your problems, but we can't continue troubleshooting unless you let us know what worked and what didn't ^_^","replies":[]},{"poster":"SwarmOfSeagulls","date":"2017-11-10T04:13:38.980+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"i suggest trying battlerite out. its new but already way more fun way way more balanced dont have 20 mins of sitting in a lane and best of all....it works and the devs listen and help with problems.
