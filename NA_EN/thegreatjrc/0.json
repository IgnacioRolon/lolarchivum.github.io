Maybe this seems theoretically unsound. But developers do control the size of the circle for each variable. Therefore, they can choose a range larger than the computer realistically needs. E.g. an 8-bit integer (the smallest range) enumerates up to 2^8 = 256 unique values and often specifies a range of either [0, 255] or [-128, 127]. \n\nWhy [0, 255] and not [0, 256]? Because computers count from '0' whereas humans count from '1'. If humans counted from '0', we'd say 2017 was in the 20th century instead of the 21st century. See also [Why numbering should start at zero](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD08xx/EWD831.html) by Dijkstra. \n\nWhy is [-128, 127] unsymmetrical? A naive binary encoding would double-count zero as '-0' and '+0'. But this leads to \"5 - 10 = -4\". We'd prefer only a _single_ zero. So we pretend '-0' is actually '-1' and tug the remaining negative values over a notch.

So what's happening is that Ezreal is taking out a loan with Future's Market, putting his gold below 0, and because an unsigned value can't represent negative numbers, it's rolling back round to the maximum possible integer.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Elipo","date":"2017-11-13T05:38:52.130+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":10,"body":"dodge his skillshot kit, stay behind your minions so he can't q you.
