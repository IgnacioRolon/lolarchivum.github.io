I remember i didn't even know what a MOBA was at the time and I just clicked random and got Sona. I remember I didn't know how to level up abilities so instead of maxing out a certain ability right away, I leveled them all equally over time. I miss those days because everyone was truly having fun, including me. Now these days I don't even have the feeling of fun in me anymore when I log on. I get on, get into a game, witness my own friends become frustrated simply because they gave first blood and it hurts to watch because I watch and remember when we first started playing together. Long story short, he taught me how to play and we had fun and he didn't mind when we lost because he knew I was still learning. However once I hit level 30 and we started playing ranked, I saw him become this monster who did nothing but vent on me and produce negative thoughts and results. Now these days I play two games and then I sit there not knowing what to do next, because I have nothing else to do but if I go back into another game, I know it will just be another painful experience.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JLau","date":"2014-12-28T02:51:27.700+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I love this.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Artorris","date":"2014-12-27T21:56:13.383+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"RIOT PUT THIS IN THE LAUNCHER  PLEEEEASE","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gwellaouen","date":"2014-12-26T18:25:56.960+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"So cool and so true. \n\nLove this video.

And it had spread around me affecting those players, people, coworkers and family. But that was long ago, Because one day showed me something, Was that I had seen my life flashed before my eyes, And from that moment is what had changed me, Because I saw what I was doing wrong and found out just how much I could better my self as a person and a player. And I have learned there's a hell of allot to the game than I could have possibly imagined since than. I am afraid of hate and what it means, Because hate can destroy you and throw you around like a rag doll. I am a more honest player, I communicate more and i respect teamwork for what it stands, I love to win even if i have to lose 10 times in a row just to win.

They intentionally put themselves in a hyper competitive environment where the goal is to be the best, and then get disappointed when people take it seriously. \n\nThat's the whole point of teambuilder and normal blind / draft. Those are there to just play for fun and enjoyment and experimentation.

And it did break my heart, seeing as I used to be one of those players who went Wu AP (that's around the time I joined) or Leona mid because I was new to the game, with actual new players on both sides. It we had fun and laughs. After a while I started to become the toxic player (I blame the family member who introduced me seeing as I was like 12-15 at the time) and he was really good. So I began to start talking trash to my teammates and the enemy thinking I might just be like him and become better with no concern for others. Why? Because it's online. Nobody knows who I am and I can't be punished. Then a year or two ago or so I kept getting bans over and over again with different accounts, either for going AFK if the match wasn't going well or raging hardcore and getting reported to the tribunal. Eventually I started to mature and become the person who I am today, which is who I like, and I slowly became calmer and more patient. When I came up with this account as a joke with a friend who I found out plays League, before I introduced and was the reason for about 4 other players joining, I was considered a \"smurf\". After finding out what it was I slowed down and helped those who were new, went easy on them, gave them tips whether they were with or against me, and started becoming a positive influence on the community. Of course I am slowly going back to the toxic side a bit I will not lie, as you might have seen from a previous \"hot post\" I have created. But even now I am trying again to be calm and positive, even going through the process of muting everyone at the start of the game if I feel like I might rage. So I don't take it out on them. This video reminds me of the change I am and did go through, and it does hurt once again to know I was and am almost again \"that\" guy.\nSo as I pick up my heart pieces from the floor I say, I have always loved League no matter what. The toxic side of the community is something that will most likely stay here forever, and that can't be changed. Riot no matter how many times they screwed up did provide and create something we enjoy today. Funny enough, with my recent purchase of Jarvan and my learning of new ways to play and think, despite some current issues I am able to actually have a lot of fun in League again.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CarrierKestral","date":"2014-12-27T01:20:34.072+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"this wouldnt be an issue if we didnt have a majority of the community as 4fun players.
