Riot wants Zed to be the strongest champion in the game because that&#x27;s what twelve year olds spending their parent&#x27;s money want.\n\nThey said they are streamlining classes, creating subgroups organized into big classes. In most games, be it RPG, MMORPG or MOBAs Assasins are the mage killers, they are designed for it. They seem to want the same thing here, which is not exactly bad - I mean, it makes sense - But Zed kit is obnoxious to play against and they should nerf the hell out of it so he can pay for all that mobility and safety. The best way we have to dislike this change is giving dear Zed a 90%+ ban rate tho\n\nThis buff isn't aimed only at Zed, either. Look at the new mage changes, how many of them are based on debuffs?\nCassiopeia, Brand, Malzahar, Vel'koz have a small debuff system that empowers them, outside of CC. QSS could remove those things.\n\nFew things were more frustrating than being a mage murdering an ADC just to have him cleanse out with QSS your ignite, debuffs and kill you with basic attacks.

ZH is 120 sec in 6.9 (up from 90). _**Zed's ultimate's CD will NEED to be nerfed.**_ I've played Zed though I'm no expert and I honestly feel little to no punishment for abusing his ult.\n\nAnyways, ZH changes in 6.9 makes Zhonya's more a counter/utility item when you really need it (vs Zeds) while the decreased AP means it's going to be less of an impulse buy on pretty much every mage that only really wants an excuse to be invulnerable for second. `-`\n\nALSO! Zhonya's is getting cheaper in the 6.9 so your squishy champs can build it faster vs Zeds. It's still 3000g, but faster is faster.\nZhonya's also gives you 10% CDR so you may have more just that little bit extra breathing room to make actual plays against a Zed.\n\n\nThough I do agree how his reply seems to be centered around AD based champs.
