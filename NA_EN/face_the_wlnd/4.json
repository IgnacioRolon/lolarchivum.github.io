According to her lore, Taliyah is encountered by Yasuo after running away from the carnage left behind whilst fighting along side Noxus against Ionia, and Yasuo takes her under his &quot;wing&quot; (Haha get it, because she&#039;s a bird, get it? Ok.) and tries to guide Taliyah as to how to control and unlock her power. So due to her aquintence with Yasuo I obviously suspect they will have great synergy (Yay!), but I also think that Taliyah will be the first support to enable a melee adc to botlane, and be a viable pick. Another reason I suspect this is because Riot has stated they would like botlane to support a wider variety of adc&#039;s not specific to just marksmen. These are just my speculations, I would love to hear your thoughts, lore related theories, speculations, and guesses on what Taliyah as a champion will be like!","replies":[{"poster":"Stars Shaper","date":"2016-04-28T19:32:49.476+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":2,"body":"{{champion:157}} “I now understand why much of your desert is flat.”\n\nWe got some infos on her chest.\n\n_I was really expecting some anime reaction from her._","replies":[{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2016-04-28T19:34:17.119+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Does he actually say that?
