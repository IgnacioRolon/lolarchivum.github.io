It's been working fine until recently. I logged into it perfectly fine but then I get a Maestro error saying something like can't connect to maestro. please try again. so I click the box and it exits out. I looked around for a solution found some that says its a firewall/anti virus problem, run it as an admin, and then some say restart the pc. I've tried to disable the firewall and uninstall the anti virus still no results. I've also tried to run it as an admin that didnt work either. Restarting didnt work. Repairing and uninstall lol didnt work. I'm so frustrated...I'm turning to the players for some help with my dilemma with this.  Any help will be appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-20T04:28:41.950+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maestro is a service that the client relies on to stay connected to the game platform.
