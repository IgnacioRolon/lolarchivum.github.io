It keeps coming up with a message saying that there's too much of a ranked difference between us. Neither one of us is ranked in flex. I just barely placed myself in Silver 5 in solo queue, and he has yet to finish his placement, although I expect him to land high silver.\r\nThe only thing that makes sense is that its still taking data from last season where my ranked flex level was merely a bronze 1, and he made it to silver, i don't know which rank in silver.\r\nIf that's the case, that's dumb. Is this a bug or do I seriously need to find another team to flex rank until I'm silver in flex so I can play with my buddy?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2018-01-19T22:00:39.653+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey guys, the premade queuing issues should be resolved now.  If you still have issues queueing with friends there are some other caveats.  If you were disqualified in the previous season you would be unranked for this season queueing with a friend.  Your tiers also need to have been placed in the same ranked mode to queue together as well.  Hope that helps clear things up!","replies":[{"poster":"apoc37","date":"2018-01-20T04:28:06.761+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"RTRD Nico","date":"2018-01-19T00:14:51.353+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"same problem. bump.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BaileyBrooke","date":"2018-01-19T20:53:08.755+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Having the same problem with my friends, any news?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pandoras Actor","date":"2018-01-19T19:52:02.340+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same problem, been having it since the season started. It is weird because from my group  we tried different combinations to see who it could be but it seems to be just random. Some who were on the same rank cannot start together, others who have a difference in rank as in silver/gold can start together and vice versa.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Azziecat","date":"2018-01-19T04:43:03.454+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This was an issue highlighted on the server status yesterday, but has disappeared today.\n\nI've been trying to queue with various people since the new season ticked over and always get the message about rank difference being too high even though the people I am trying to queue with should have been the right rank.\n\nI've spoken to two people from support and one said it was still a known issue, while the other said it was resolved. The only help they would offer me was to check the server status or the boards, both of which don't seem to have any information any more.\n\nThe other issue I've found is that some people don't know their exact flex rank from last season, and there is no way to check it. So I haven't been sure if the issue is a game bug, my account being bugged, or just friends with poor memories of their actual rank from last season.","replies":[]},{"poster":"dqwan","date":"2018-01-19T02:44:19.764+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am the buddy, and yeah, its pretty lame.
