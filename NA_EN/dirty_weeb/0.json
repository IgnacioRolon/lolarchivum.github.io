why pick an adc who is gonna build lethality. \n\nor a jungler who builds lethality? \n\nif you are facing a team that has burst/assassins a hyper carry melee like yi you need hard cc and to shit on him as a team comp you arent beating him by yourself. \n\npeople wanna make this game into a competitive 1 vs 1 solo game to show their skill when its a competitive team game. if you watch pro games and the picks/bans team comps and how they structure this and counter pick etc it would more insight that 1 champ vs 1 champ dont win or lose game its a whole comp and how they work together. \n\nas far as vs maokai... you need two damage dealers that can shred a tank... you need someone to keep him from being the engager and lock him down so your damage dealers can shred him. \n\nkindred is good vs maokai for the bork/black cleaver build he goes with blood razor cuz thats a lot of dps and % hp damage and armor pen/shred and if he engages upon you and your team your ult helps if you play it right. \n\nbut picking kindred in jungle means you give up something in your comp that has to be made up else where. she is a range carry in jungle who can turn into a hyper carry \n\nbut you have no cc, no tankyness, no engage/peel etc so somewhere in your team you need these factors. top? support? mid might have cc and some peel but typically not alot, adc really dont some have some utility \n\nthis is where the fault of solo queue and non team play lies... people pick whatever they feel they are best at or want to play so shit like team comps and playing around it etc kinda goes out the window\nand because most have this mentality of SOLO CARRY instead of TEAM WIN you get every one playing for themselves instead of picking and playing as a team. \n\nand this is a clear difference in play at pro level and the rest of us","replies":[{"poster":"Dirty Weeb","date":"2017-08-02T01:14:11.241+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"damn dude thanks for the explanation, il keep that in mind","replies":[{"poster":"oSEXYPLATYPUSo","date":"2017-08-02T01:17:07.049+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"also keep in mind play a champ like a maokai kinda buffers you room for mistakes and are slightly forgiven due to the nature of the champ and build \n\nif you were to make the same mistakes on a different class of champ you would have some really glaring deaths \nand in a game where the team who makes the least mistakes and dont get punished as hard for them usually will win... sometimes its not about the plays you can make its about the mistakes you dont make","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
