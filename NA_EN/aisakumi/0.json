It seems that the Alpha Client doesn&#039;t have this, at least not in the post-game lobby. I thought this was a really nice feature, and hope that they implement it somehow in the client. It&#039;s nice to know how many AURFs or ARAMs I&#039;ve won and lost in total.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Codebear","date":"2016-11-07T17:45:37.697+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Aisakumi,\n\nThanks for the post!  This is something that is still in our backlog.  Just to be transparent with you, we de-prioritized the work until we had a clearer view on where we wanted to take the post-game user experience.  This is something that we will get to in the future, but it may take a few patches before you see it.\n\nHope the context helps :)","replies":[{"poster":"Aisakumi","date":"2016-11-12T01:21:55.869+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Great, thanks!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GunKil1er","date":"2016-11-07T12:34:18.682+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Super agree, we can see if we got better once in a while not just by playing ranked :D\nBeside that, it's a really nice feature :D","replies":[]},{"poster":"Elite Drones","date":"2016-11-07T04:27:29.451+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"i agree with this i use to use this reference on my champions and how i progress and the champs i usually win with,","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sir Rei","date":"2016-11-08T01:50:58.142+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{item:3285}} {{item:3285}} {{item:3285}} When I finished a game I was put in the lobby but it was super laggy and I pressed the sum icon change and I couldn't exit out of it.
