Also why does it matter what I've said in the past?  Does it invalidate what I say now?  I want to enjoy this game but the shitty low elo community drives me nuts.  It's a love-hate relationship.","replies":[{"poster":"AeroWaffle","date":"2017-04-14T03:52:10.921+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"A plethora of MMOs.\n\nThe various other games inspired by dota such as dota 2, smite, and hots.\n\nAnd yeah, it does kinda matter what you were saying in the past.

Yeah I've \"dealt\" with around 12 or so losses over the past 2 days.
