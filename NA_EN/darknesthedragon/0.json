I would have done things differently had I not been misinformed by Riot.  40+ skin shards in my inventory lost value.","replies":[]},{"poster":"haywire android","date":"2017-09-06T17:21:42.454+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Seems to be some conflicting information here. Posting what I've read just in case.\n\n\"Hey! The rates of orange essence from shards will be going down in the pre-season so I would advise you disenchant any shards you do not wish to keep in order to get the most essence out of them.\"\n\n-Riotaredherring (https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/6xg9hi/upcoming_changes_to_leveling_ip_rewards/dmfpf4p/)\n\nI made the following suggestion in another thread, to avoid situations like these where players potentially will loose out on thier currently earned essence:\n\nI think that players who has used the crafting system to collect skin shards should be able to keep thier skin shards without loosing essence, just add the amount the skin shards are lowered with direcly as orange essence to the accounts. I like that the system is improved, but forcing the veterans of the system to disenchant or lose value is a poor solution, and I'm pretty certain that a lot of players will miss potential news (no mather how many) and just log into the game and notice that what they've previusly earned has devalued.","replies":[{"poster":"DarknesTheDragon","date":"2017-09-06T23:16:56.757+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thanks for the info. and let me get this straight Riot. people who have been playing this game for a while and collecting things like champ and skin shards are now going to have the value of those decreased screwing people like me who have been hoarding the skin shards they want since you released the crafting. you're making it so that we can't earn ip from playing games only from leveling up (like overwatch which isn't something i think you want to be compared to) and youre changing the way that champ shards are working so that they're only a 20% discount on the champs making them practically worthless and more of a \"oh hey i happen to have this so whatever\". flipping the middle finger to all of your veteran players who have spent a lot of time in your game (see \"https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/o1hsbxt5-the-real-reason-veteran-players-are-unhappy-with-the-rune-rework\" ) BUT HEY RUNES ARE FREE RIGHT? and im almost a hundred percent certain that riot is going to completely ignore everyone and whos talking about how unfair this idea is and go with it anyway because HEY you'll make more money off of new players who don't want to grind and so just buy chests! nice marketing sham Riot 10/10 forgive my salt but i've been grinding this game really hard to get some nice stuff and right now it feels like you're practically throwing it in my face","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DarknesTheDragon","date":"2017-09-06T03:26:08.134+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ok thanks for the assist, but do you know when exactly preseason patch hits?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-06T16:44:39.926+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Won't know until it's announced, likely through our [News](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/) page!","replies":[]}]}]}]}
