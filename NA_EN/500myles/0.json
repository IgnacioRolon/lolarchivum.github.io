There will be absolutely no warning, no high ping, nothing. Just randomly it will be unable to connect and then have no choice but to exit the game and come back. It usually happens 3-5 times a game making it very difficult for myself and my team. \r\nI thought it could be my wifi but it has happened now in two completely different wifi networks. It again has only started happening since I downloaded patch 7.15 this morning. Was playing fine last night. \r\nHow can I fix this? Could it be my computer? (I dont see how, the game was running perfectly fine on it yesterday)\r\nI uninstalled and reinstalled it last week because the file size of the game was getting very large on my computer. Could that have something to do with it?\r\nPlease help!!!!!","replies":[{"poster":"ScromegaPrime","date":"2017-07-27T18:23:07.665+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm having the same issue.

Grab your network logs from a game that froze up like this and pop them into our [**log reader**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743). If you can grab a screenshot of what it says using something like Gyazo, post it here so that we can go over it together!","replies":[{"poster":"EvilGen1us","date":"2017-08-03T05:11:47.690+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i have been tracking my fps and cpu and gpu temp. they were all fine. but after the recent patch 7.15 update (i'm in NA).. every game approx 5mins or so in..the game sound will suddenly cut out for 2 seconds then comes back and then the whole game freezes. it is frustrating as i have a decent new comp. i formatted and reinstalled windows already. and updated all drivers. so not sure what's wrong. 7.10 to 7.14 no problems at all.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bullymonk","date":"2017-08-02T13:03:51.620+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm having the same issue.
