These audits were designed to compliment our PB systems by finding players who “fell through the cracks” of detection.  We then feed the results of our audits back into our PB systems to improve detection so less and less bad experiences get missed in the future. \r\n\r\nWe stand by these audits; upon review **99% of players audited were correctly disciplined**.  Intentional Feeders, Bots, cheaters, and rage quitters are all common offenses found through our audits.  But in very rare instances players who chose extremely unusual picks could end up getting audited.  When we dug deeper we found it was usually the result of poor communication with their team that caused extreme frustration and pain; players (and even the reviewing rioter) would interpret this poor teamwork as intentionally trolling.  \r\n\r\nTo be honest, it’s pretty rare to see bans of these type; every day we see thousands of oddball/unusual picks that don’t result in any reports or bans and go through matches normally. So in these weird and unusual cases (4 or 5 a year) where players were banned for going off the reservation, we dove in to see if the player’s behavior deserved a penalty and if they did, what kind of penalty. **The thing that stands out about these edge cases are that their goal was to win; although their attempts were often muddled by unclear or inconsistent communication** with their team mates.**  Doing crazy stuff and challenging the meta is something we want to enshrine in League of Legends.**   And although this may cause a higher burden on teammates and communication; **after review we feel a 14 day ban for imperfect communication (when there is a clear intent to win matches) is too harsh.**\r\n\r\nAfter a lot of talk internally we’ve developed a new policy that protects players who want to try new and unusual stuff while also ensuring that we shield all players from actual trolls and intentional feeders.\r\n\r\nHere’s how that process will work:\r\n\r\n- Players who cause an undue amount of frustration and pain because of a crazy pick but are dedicated to winning (not trolling) will not receive a ban instead we’ll temporarily lock their account.  The player will get a message to reach out to Player Support so they can unlock their account.  Before you guys get too scared, given our review of past audits, we feel this will only apply to a few players a year.  Seriously, last year thousands of these audits were performed, and we saw only a tiny handful of these cases appear.\r\n- When contacted; Player Support will let the player know they’re not banned, but temporarily locked out of their account because of an audit. We’ll share in-game examples and reports of the kind of behavior that’s causing them to pop up on our radar.\r\n- The player gets feedback on how they can communicate what they’re trying to do and how their team can win without ruining the experience of people they play with. After that Player Support will unlock their account.\r\n- With their account unlocked the player is free to return to games right away.\r\n- Player Support will reach out again if they find any actual behavior problems. If they’re flagged with unsportsmanlike conduct, or outright trolling, they’ll receive a penalty. If it’s just their style to try to win with weird picks and unusual plays then they won’t get a penalty.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe want players who enjoy playing off-meta picks but massively disrupt their team to learn and adjust their communication on their own, without being banned. As long as a player is working towards their team’s chances of winning, we won’t punish them for non-standard play styles. That said, there are clear differences between meta breaking and straight up trolling.  We stand firm that people who intentionally troll and disrupt games in League will end up banned.\r\n\r\nAll this talk on the topic made us want to dig deeper into how players understand the meta, so we’ll be rolling out a Dev Diary to get into how we view the meta and what that means for you with Lead Gameplay Designer, Meddler. You’ll hear more on that soon.","replies":[{"poster":"Big Lincoln","date":"2017-03-27T18:18:23.063+0000","up_votes":111,"down_votes":5,"body":"finally, I won't be punished for playing AP Yi support mid with clarity and smite\n\nnow i can play my REAL main in peace, soloQ here i come!! :) ","replies":[{"poster":"Pyrithegethon","date":"2017-03-27T18:24:53.906+0000","up_votes":47,"down_votes":2,"body":"This is false because clarity is removed","replies":[{"poster":"MauFromSwe","date":"2017-03-27T19:56:15.638+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":15,"body":"Clarity is still in the game my boi, clairvoyance was removed.

I was told by one of your support staff a while back that you can _never be punished for not using chat_.\n\n2. Additionally, I have some suggestions as to how to decrease the overall levels of griefing/toxicity from players about off-meta. I would suggest that Riot design a more thorough support page and/or summoner code page which outlines in summary, what is considered trolling vs off-meta picks, when someone is actually _intentionally_ feeding versus just having a bad game, et al. I recommend that punished players' reform cards have the particular words or phrases hyperlinked to the corresponding part on the summoner code, as well.\n\n3. Can you more clearly define what communicating _at_ someone is versus communicating _with_ someone? How are off-meta players supposed to integrate into teams, whenever there is opposition to their picks and playstyle? Can you clarify what to do when one, some, or all of the team in lobby oppose your pick? What if no one opposes it, but in the game if you perform poorly/lose, they start to grief/harass you, and threaten reports? Shouldn't this sort of behavior be considered punishable _on the opposing party, not the off-meta player?_\n\n4. Adding to #2 above, I feel that the reason Riot sees these \"fringe cases\" about off-meta players being punished/reported, is due to the overwhelming attitude from a majority of players in Ranked queues, that anyone who is 'off-meta' is instantly considered 'trolling' -- therefore because of this communicative disconnect between _what Riot states is allowed_ and _the perception of off-meta picks are 'trolling' by players_, you get the results that **off-meta players are reported regardless**. Should you change the understanding and perception of the League community _as a whole_, then you will see a huge decrease in reports against off-meta picks or one trick players, because _everyone will be on the same page_.","replies":[{"poster":"BloodKnight94","date":"2017-03-27T20:50:30.900+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Bôôsted Bonobo,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=EtXQhs5J,comment-id=000300000001,timestamp=2017-03-27T18:45:14.110+0000)\n>\n> What is the stance on off-meta one trick players / off-meta players who play _a lot_, but forgo using the in-game chat or lobby chat whatsoever (mute all, etc)?

(We had a lot of the same debates that were going on in the previous boards/reddit thread internally)\n\nHopefully game design's post will give clarity to this issue.  In the short term we won't process any of these kinds of account locks until the community has a chance to see our thoughts and participate in the conversation.","replies":[{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2017-03-28T01:21:40.412+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wookie bb, support smite nunu and support smite singed both had the \"this is my play style, so fk you if you don't like it\".\n\nBoth were playing to win with off-meta strats (not only off-meta picks) and had poor communication.\n\nHow would you recommend people (such as SSSinged and SSNunu) communicate and what happens when their team refuses their strat?\n\nWhat if they choose to /mute all at the start of the game?\n\nWhat if they continued their behavior even after 1-1 talk?\n\nWould you be able to answer these questions? or is this going to be answered in Meddler's post?

A while ago, it was mutually decided by the employees at this store that everyone looks good wearing red shirts, and the owner agreed, so everyone working there since wore red shirts. Now, the store owner has a policy for employees that says \"most everyone here wears red shirts to work, but that isn't our _strict_ company uniform color; you are free to wear any color shirt you want, and you can never be fired for wearing something other than red\".\n\nWith me so far?\n\nOk, so you and I are new hires at this store, and on the first day you come in wearing blue, and I come in wearing red like everyone else. I'm following the crowd; you are not. You are however, well within your right, according to the store owner, to wear blue, even if it's different from everyone else. Now, we go in and I see you wearing blue and I tell you \"hey buddy, I don't want you wearing blue, you should wear red so you match everyone else\". Upon hearing this, you explain that blue looks better on you, red does not,many anyways you are within your right according to the store policy to _not be forced to wear red_. However, every time you come in to work wearing blue, myself or some other random employee either harasses you about wearing blue, and/or just files a complaint with the owner. Every time, you explain clearly why you are wearing blue to every random employee that gives you grief about it, day in and day out.\n\nEventually, the owner brings you aside and says **you are fired** -- when asked why, you are told that \"well, we're not firing you _for wearing blue_, but since we had so many complaints about it (even though according to our **very own store policy you are allowed to**), we felt that we needed to fire you because you _weren't communicating to your fellow employees well enough your intention for wearing blue_\".\n\nNow do you see where the disconnect is? \n\nYou are doing something completely authorized and within the bounds of the store's policy _as it is written_, except some coworkers _still don't want you wearing a different color than them_, and even after you explain yourself _over and over every single time you go to work_, they still complain to the owner about you wearing a different color. _You are being held hostage to the whims and demands of any random coworker that complains, whether or not you have explained to them the reason for you being different_.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Goose009","date":"2017-03-27T21:44:46.362+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"So, what if these infamous off-meta pick players had sub 50% win-rates? \n\nI am all for off-meta but I am concerned about the message... \n\nI guess, I am questioning that if the smite support nunu had a 44% win-rate instead of 54% would we still be having this conversation?\n\nWhat is the required win-rate to play in ranked?

I just found a sub-50% player in plat 5. Didn't take me all that long, either. Now, maybe he's off meta, I won't be digging that far. However, he's sitting decently high with a 47.78% winrate on Lolking. So, either it takes no skill/will to get that high, or 50% winrate is not an indicator of skill/will. I'm somewhat for the former, but the point is that 50% winrate is not necessarily something to scoff at.","replies":[]}]}]}
