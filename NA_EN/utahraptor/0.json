Now back then I didn't even know that it was a legendary, and I didn't even own Janna so I didn't really care. Now playing Janna and realizing what a good skin that is, I'm just curious, why don't I have it? I mean, I rerolled into permanent and got it, but if I don't own the champion does that mean I don't get it?","replies":[{"poster":"Utahraptor","date":"2017-09-04T11:45:37.830+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think I did activate permanent while I didn't have the champion.

I checked all of your histories, even purchases and hextech rerolls as well, but I'm not seeing any trace of Forecaster Janna on this account. Could you be talking about a different account?","replies":[]},{"poster":"BlargChikaBlargh","date":"2017-09-04T02:05:20.951+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did you activate the shard (unlock as skin permanent after the reroll)?
