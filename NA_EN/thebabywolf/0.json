This hacker isn't giving up on your account then. I suggest making a ticket to riot for more help. Assuming your hacker probably still has access to your account, I advise making a ticket under a different account of yours, to prevent the hacker from reading your ticket. If the hacker does NOT have access anymore, I'd still suggest making a ticket to Riot for help on further instructions on how to prevent the hacker from robbing your account. \n\nLink's here: \nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us\n\nClick \"Submit a Request\" and choose the option best suitable to your issue here. Make sure to provide information that may prove that you're the original owner. (I know you are, but they need it) Make sure to provide ISP and date when you created the account, Card/Phone you may have used to buy RP on the account. Make sure to see if they can help you from keeping that hacker from continuing robbing your account.","replies":[{"poster":"theBabyWolf","date":"2017-10-20T15:19:21.929+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Already did it with this account and with an email which wasn't attached to any Riot Account.","replies":[{"poster":"Giojun","date":"2017-10-20T15:22:00.727+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alright.
