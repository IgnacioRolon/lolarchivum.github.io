He's been my favorite champion for about 9 months now and recently started working on the guide Riot PhillyBrew linked. It's very much still a work in progress and feedback is welcomed. I have over 400 games with Taric at a platinum level (S4 and S5) and generally, I feel comfortable first-picking him in soloq.\n\nI'm hoping as the guide is fleshed out, it'll be able to provide a bit of an introduction. Unfortunately, I don't have any videos, but you can keep a lookout at my op.gg page and you'll be able to watch it in action. I'll try to record some games there.\n\nThe TLDR is Taric is a Tank Burst + DPS support. Typically Burst and DPS don't go together, but Taric's passive helps him get several spell rotations in fights and he ends up doing a fair bit of burst by stacking armor and setting up for other champions.\n\nBuild path is typically focuses on building components of Face of the Mountain, Frozen Heart and Locket of the Iron Solari, and Boots (Tabi, mobi, or Merc Threads). Only after these 4 items are built, will he build Thornmail, Randuins, Sunfire Cape and if you're feeling semi-troll, possibly a Tri-force.\n\nI'm happy to do a deep dive into other areas if you have specific questions.","replies":[{"poster":"Reidy","date":"2015-03-25T13:38:27.407+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you have any ETA on completing the Taric guide? I'd be interested in hearing what you have to say with him considering you're still playing him.\n\nI guess you could say I mained him in Season 2 (89 games played as opposed to Maokai at 56 xD) \n\nI love playing off-meta champs now and if Taric is decent enough to win games, I wanna try and go back to him...","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"DynamicDouchebag","date":"2015-03-24T19:11:56.535+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Taric needs a spotlight? \"stun you, huehuehue, team attack!\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ironhand","date":"2015-03-24T20:39:11.814+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Well Taric has a ton of issues both on the rift and off it and I would wait until he is reworked.","replies":[]}]}
