He was a lot of fun, but I found his soldier placement kinda wonky/clunky.\r\n\r\nSo I was thinking, it would have helped a bit if instead of a normal targeting reticule, the cast indicator was instead an AoE indicator with their attack range.\r\n\r\nWould/could this be a nice thing to have or would it just be annoying?","replies":[{"poster":"ZenonTheStoic","date":"2015-04-23T20:44:04.901+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's a great idea!
