I just made it to level 41, and as of now it takes hours of playtime to level up. And all I get in return is about 600 blue essence. I hate the idea of being forced into buying RP for CHAMPIONS. It seems like we don't have much of a choice. Riot please make blue essence less of a rarity in the next patch. I've never seen someone happy with this change.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-28T23:52:39.882+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"You aren't being forced into buying RP to get champions just like you weren't with IP, the rewards just feel a bit different since they're mostly contained in capsules after level-ups now. Don't forget the other method of getting champs as well, using those shards to unlock the champion permanently. Overall, you're most often getting more BE on average than IP considering you can infinitely levelup.  You don't have to save up 6300 BE for every champ either, since most cost 4800 or lower.","replies":[]}]}
