Your research is spot on, super impressive! We listened to a lot of different flutes and were most inspired by the Quena's sound; however Nunu & Willump's music isn't played by one exactly. We loved the sound, but the key wasn't right & the timbre was a bit too \"bright\" for something in the Freljord. So the flute you hear in their Login music is a cane/wood flute like the Quena (although it was performed more like a traditional flute, not recorder), but then we EQ'd the sound after the recording to make it a bit darker/warmer. So glad to hear you love the sound! <3","replies":[{"poster":"BeatzBoyFTW","date":"2018-08-30T17:50:30.542+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Before anyone comments him about their balancing bullshit, this Rioter here has absolutely nothing to do with balance.

The Login Music is one of the reasons I come back to league, I genuinely stayed in login screen for 15 minutes listening to this one!
