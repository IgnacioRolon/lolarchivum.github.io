We kind of need some help.\r\n\r\nMy cousin logged onto his league account this morning to find that someone logged into his account and bought $100 worth of RP. He changed the password and opened a ticket with Riot and left to run some errands. He just got back and found that his account got TRANSFERRED to a whole new server.\r\n\r\nHe doesn't know which one it is, so he can't log in and check the ticket and he has no way of talking to Riot. Can someone please help?\r\n\r\nHis IGN is CLG Aphrodude and it WAS on NA. No idea where it could be now. Thanks in advance.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-04T18:14:16.355+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your cousin can reach out to us without having to login to the ticketing center by submitting an[ account recovery form](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=72416) or sending an email to support@riotgames.com.
