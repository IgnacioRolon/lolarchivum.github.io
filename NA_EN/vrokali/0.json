When it's my turn to pick in Ranked, after I choose my champion and click on \"DONE\" the lobby bugs out and goes blank. I hover around to reveal as much as I can of the blank UI as I can and then LoL crashes. Thankfully I can estimate when the game starts and then relog to reconnect to the game before closing the client.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LND CarryPotter","date":"2018-02-10T06:40:22.985+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello guys i have a problem with error dumb file 183 when im champion select crash please help me im wait you thx !! ;(","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-22T17:58:38.905+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Crashes inside of champ select are most often caused by your client temporarily losing connection to the server, which disconnects you from the champ select instance.
