And the Nexus Blitz map obviously isnt finished, visually. I think it would be really cool if Riot made the map look like the Magma Chamber would&#039;ve, with the Nexus Blitz layout, of course. Since the Magma Chamber never was released. I think the aesthetics would suit Nexus Blitz really well with lava and obsidian, etc. I have no idea if Riot has the magma chamber stored away in a file somewhere in their super secret archives but I guess they could re-use some of the textures from that. Its just an idea though. https://i.gyazo.com/bfc80d7f4e35dfda2e9355e758644fef.jpg https://i.gyazo.com/6a64f78e6db416a02fa8e7d995747bb2.png https://i.gyazo.com/0c4613dc1984456a8d1699b452d0c750.jpg https://i.gyazo.com/2dead35151e051a2874a8de692ac979f.png\n{{sticker:leblanc-funny}}","replies":[{"poster":"Camille Ferrøs","date":"2018-08-16T18:53:33.113+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"I would personally like something else then this.
