I just played through (sometimes with just a team of 4) and then tried again.\nGetting the augments let's you get stronger and be your own kind of DoomBot, while the mission that ask for minimal augments are more of the \"challenge and testing yourself\" type of mission.\nI never felt I had to \"beg\" to get some missions going. I just went in, asked nicely, and then we either did it for the mission or we went in and just played.\nAs for finding people to que up with, that is also not Riot's fault. Either find friends (if ya have any that play league) or just go in and hope for the best.\nIt really is that simple.","replies":[]}]}
