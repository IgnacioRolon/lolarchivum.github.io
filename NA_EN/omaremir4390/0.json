My question would be, what if an entire city suffered a blackout? What happens then. Obvious this is an isolated issue, albeit not THAT isolated, but it can affect a large group of people.","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-05-11T22:28:03.088+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Totally get where you are coming from.  Loss Prevented is activated when there are Server Wide issues.  However, there are hundreds of players on any one server, and the odds that multiple people are from the same specific city is actually incredibly low.  Additionally, this is done specifically for when the server itself is having issues.  While random acts of God really do suck, as long as they happen rarely, you won't be penalized outside of losing a game.\n\nI wish I could give some better info!  >.<  Let me know if you have any other questions!","replies":[{"poster":"omaremir4390","date":"2016-05-13T05:38:13.648+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes I suppose you are right. My issue isn't with the loss itself, but when it happens to me, I get the leavebuster delay. This has happened before, albeit only once with blackouts but with my service provider doing maintenance or something like that that causes me to DC. How am I to control that. At least let me not get leavebuster delays for these issues...","replies":[]}]}]}
