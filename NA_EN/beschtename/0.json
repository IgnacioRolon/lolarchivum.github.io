(A good rule of thumb is never say anything more than twice.)\n* Asking for reports.\n* Threatening, blackmailing or bullying your team in any way. This specifically includes any reference to going AFK, feeding or aiding the enemy.\n* Anything that could be construed as you not doing your best (Im not helping bot any more!, for example).\n* Whining, especially if its about your team not surrendering.\n\n>Basically, you should avoid anything you would not say at the funeral of a loved one or during the interview for your dream job.","replies":[{"poster":"côw","date":"2017-09-29T23:58:01.155+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"\"Basically, you should avoid anything you would not say at the funeral of a loved one or during the interview for your dream job.\"\nYou're fucking joking right?

Those just limit how many messages one can send at a time and don't prevent one from playing the game. Regardless of whether or not you think it's punish worthy  there are certain things that aren't considered acceptable regardless of context both here and in the real world, hence the zero-tolerance policy for them, and hence the part you quoted: \n\n>Basically, you should avoid anything you would not say at the funeral of a loved one or during the interview for your dream job.\n\nAlso, even if other people were acting up the \"they started it\" excuse doesn't work here, nor did it work in school as fighting fire with fire just makes things worse. I get how frustrating dealing with flamers can be but in those situations it's better to just mute, report and move on rather than add to the flame war.\n\nP.S. I personally don't see the point in tracking people you've reported as it takes time away from other more productive things.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"zPOOPz","date":"2017-09-15T21:17:12.609+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"mind...blown...\n\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-mindblown}}","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"AriCei","date":"2017-09-19T22:07:11.981+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Honestly your ban system should be reserved for real offensive negativity.
