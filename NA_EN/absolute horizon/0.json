Please make sure your video card is using the latest video drivers from the manufacturer.\"  I have tried to follow the suggestions of others who encountered the same error.  First of all I did verify that my drivers were indeed up to date (which they are).  Second I tried deleting the game.cfg and input.txt files from League/config directory as well as League of Legends/RADS/projects/lol_game_client and lol_game_client_en_us and running a repair on the launcher.  This doesn't seem to make a difference.  The game has run just fine before tonight.  I even ran a game earlier this evening and had no problems.  Now since then every single time I try to play a game I encounter this error.  What do I do?  I'm probably going to be punished for \"abandoning games\" at this rate at the very least since I can't even connect to them. \n\nEdit: It seems I am now ineligible to earn loot because of this issue, great.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-09T22:50:38.488+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just to be clear, the ineligibility for loot message you saw was most likely for that single match. I haven't seen any case where a player was continuously ineligible for loot after disconnecting from a match once. The error you're running into is most likely caused by corrupt or missing files inside your Directx locale. You should be able to resolve this by running and installing **all available windows updates** before installing [**this standalone package**](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=34429) from Microsoft for Directx 9.\n\nLet me know if this resolved your issues.,","replies":[]}]}
