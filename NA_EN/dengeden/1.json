Well, with a few rare exceptions (Blitzcrank&#039;s laugh makes some robot noises even when his voice is muted e.g.).\n\nAll you&#039;re doing by saying stupid things in chat or spamming ctrl+4 is encouraging people to mute both permanently. Denying people the possibility of encountering a friendly enemy player or enjoying the champions&#039; voice lines. The only reason you&#039;d do either of those things is if your goal is to deny people those possibilities. So. Thanks.\n\nEdit: Anyway, thanks to all the people who stood up and called it legitimate. It proved my point perfectly and please read what I say next time.","replies":[{"poster":"Cup of Cocoa","date":"2017-07-02T15:24:34.545+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean, to be fair... what else would Riot create a voice line specifically called \"taunt\" for?","replies":[{"poster":"Dengeden","date":"2017-07-03T17:55:15.897+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"For banter for those who wish to hear it.","replies":[{"poster":"ElizabethBáthory","date":"2017-07-07T11:24:22.551+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Liiike, taunting the enemy team, you can call it whatever you want, Banter, annoying, w.e but it's entirely based on how the other party receives it.

Unnecessary, but all the power to you.\n\nOn the other hand, regardless of how tilt proof you are, it does get annoying to see your opponent bm, especially if they do it every time they get a kill.
