Sometimes the 1-3 second delay makes it so that the last command i put in just gets forgot and i just stand there or i'm stuck moving in one direction that i wanted to go in a second ago but then i can't move anymore so i just walk into the enemy and basically give them free harass or a kill. I've already made a bunch of posts about this and only gotten replies on one. the few replies i got said to check my drivers and make sure i don't have any big computer updates. so last night i did all of that. my drivers were fine. I checked to update my display adapters which were at the most up to date possible option already. is there something else in my drivers i should update? i'm still new to having a pc. I've only had this pc for 9 or so months so that's another thing to note, the computer i'm using is new and i haven't had this problem before or any problems up until now. i'm using NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 6GB as the display adapter. I was told by someone to try unplugging my mouse and keyboard after my computer was shut down. i tired that and it didn't really do anything. they also threw in the idea of completely cleaning out my computer and doing  a factory restart. but i reallly realllly don't want to do that. anyways i also checked to see if there was any big update i was missing which i wasn't but later last night i got a notification saying a new one had just come. i did it and tried a game this morning and the delay was still there. any help would be really appreciated. it's incredibly aggravating loading in to a game and seeing everything in real time but having a lag that isn't clearly affected by internet.","replies":[{"poster":"ChrisBrownze","date":"2019-10-10T06:59:15.713+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It honestly sounds like youve maxed out your troubleshooting abilities and besides suggesting the things youve already tried, the boards really cant help you. \n\nI would honestly take your computer to a computer shop and have them take a look at it. They will be able to troubleshoot it, run diagnostics, etc. If you live in Canada, I would recommend taking it to Canada Computers, if youre in the US, find the nearest computer parts store and take it there. These computer shops usually have a repair department.","replies":[{"poster":"Ivern a Tree Guy","date":"2019-10-10T18:05:23.412+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ty for the help. i'll definitely look around in my local area to see if there are any shops that can help. i'm not quite sure what exactly to ask though since everything else works fine for the computer it's just league (to my knowledge). i'm not sure how packeting works with other applications or what.  thanks again.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-10-10T21:38:11.394+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Waste of time and money, most repair shops dont know any more than the average user and just exist to \"find\" problems and sell you new parts.
