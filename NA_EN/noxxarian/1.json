It certainly should've been worded differently, and that was the challenge with some of the questions. It's pretty much a technicality, as I composed a ton of questions, after a while, the specific technical wording faded a bit. Looking back at it now, it would make more sense to word the question with something along the lines of \"regions accessible on Valoran\" or \"can be found on Valoran\" but quite honestly, it went over my head and I just defaulted to \"The home of\" - just because it sounded nice haha. I'll definitely try to be more careful about it in the next quiz :)\n\nAlso, your final answer made me smile because that (although not official, but according to my research) should be the correct answer I'd say!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"RyzeTheSmurfMage","date":"2019-05-12T07:09:37.633+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Very nice quiz and well done animation-wise, although I wish there were some Shurima-related questions too.","replies":[{"poster":"Noxxarian","date":"2019-05-12T18:12:51.684+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RyzeTheSmurfMage,realm=EUNE,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=EydKE53o,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2019-05-12T07:09:37.633+0000)\n>\n> Very nice quiz and well done animation-wise, although I wish there were some Shurima-related questions too.\n\nThere certainly will be in the next one :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"The Iceborn","date":"2019-05-11T19:30:59.036+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is a great idea, especially for those who like their lore-knowledge tested :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Terozu","date":"2019-05-12T21:08:45.914+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bandle City is actually in a different dimension separate and connected to both Shurima and Valoran, isn't it?\nIt's the only one I got wrong so im trying to _technically_ my way out of it...
