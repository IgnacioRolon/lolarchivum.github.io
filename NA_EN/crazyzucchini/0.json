Before the whole honor system was implemented, it was easy to get keys. Chests came in frequent enough that it drew me back to the game after a year hiatus as it as a nice feeling of progress. Now, it seems like it is impossible to gain any key fragments. I am not being toxic, I am very frequently getting honored and giving out honors, not to mention playing at my peak in a while, but it seems like the fragments are just not being fairly dispersed. I think the change to have them link with honor as a player is a great idea in concept but is lacking in fairness. It feels like the standards to get key fragments are too strict and perhaps a balance between some key fragments based on performance and some on honor as a player is the best fix. I've heard about a system that automatically gives you keys after a period of time but I have NO clue how long it is considering I have literally not seen a key fragment for MONTHS (talking about 3-4 atleast)! I have chests piling up but it is SO frustrating to not be able to touch them!
