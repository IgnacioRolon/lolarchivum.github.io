I don't have any of these issues on other game maps. I am also have an issue where my victory screen goes completely red but I can still click the victory button.\r\n\r\nThe issue has been occurring since the start of season 5. Never had the issue during the preseason. I am not seeing any patterns with occurring on certain champs either. I have also tried to repair the client but this did not solve the issue either.\r\n\r\nAny input as to what may be the issue?","replies":[{"poster":"Digital Ram","date":"2015-02-05T19:27:15.317+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Delirious133, \n\nThere are a plethora of issues that can cause Summoner's Rift to crash.
