They will then have the opportunity to learn what is expected of a LOL player,  while those that display the traits of the desired behaviour will have the opportunity to play with similar players.","replies":[{"poster":"Troll Armada","date":"2016-10-19T11:55:05.403+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"wow, are you completely delusional?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sarutobi","date":"2016-10-19T09:19:46.366+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While this does look like something good on paper I don't think it would work with this game. Like the person said before, it could be abused. In all ranks no less. One would just bad rate \"good\" players so they are stuck with bad players and can stomp on them.\n\nThey should revamp the honor system and make it much more rewarding.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2016-10-19T05:07:44.523+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First, that would be very abusable in ranked, you would be given bad ratings for doing well so people don't have to play against you.\n\nSecond, if you put toxic people with other toxic people they won't see the behavior that is expected of a player, which was one of your goals.","replies":[]}]}
