That was by design because first and foremost PROJECT is about the Champions, not the world, and secondly any time and effort that could be spent on world-building for PROJECT was time that could be better spent on the core. I still hope PROJECT inspires you to theorycraft and fill in the blanks for yourself. I'm super excited to see what you think up.","replies":[{"poster":"sp441","date":"2015-09-09T13:00:29.006+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm disappointed that there isn't a PROJECT: Riven with white armor and black hair.\n\nOr a Senator Sion skin.","replies":[{"poster":"MxWhiteKnight","date":"2015-09-09T19:37:44.881+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> PROJECT: Riven with white armor and black hair.\n\nYou trying to reference Raiden with Riven??? \n\nYasuo already fills that role, and thematically even so (He negates the first damage by his shield, just as how Raiden negates damage through his pain inhibitors.)","replies":[{"poster":"sp441","date":"2015-09-09T22:43:26.812+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Jetstream Sam, actually.\n\nWhich is weird, since Yasuo looks a lot more like Jetstream Sam...\n\nAlso halfway through the game Raiden stops using his pain inhibitors.","replies":[{"poster":"MxWhiteKnight","date":"2015-09-09T23:54:13.471+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"True, the whole Iado style of Sam can clearly be attributed to Yasuo's Q. \n\nBut even then, Riven couldn't work as that type of reference.
