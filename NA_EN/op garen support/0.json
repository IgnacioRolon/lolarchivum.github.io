Mine was the biggest damage next to assassin Kayn who did 30K.\n\nFor this superb stats I only got an A+. How does this even make sense?\n\nIt was 33 min long game and I had 169 farm.\n\nIs the grading system only rewards AD's who can afk farm well? You would think solo carrying the game should get you an S- at least.\n\nThe 2nd guy who was playing full AD assassin {{champion:141}}  had 210 farm, 14 kills and did 30K damage. He got an S+\n\nIf you want a good rank you should afk farm instead of helping your team? If so Riot you really should fix this.\n\nAh the silent cowards downvoting. At least have the balls to comment why.\n\n\nI had 5K more gold then anyone else. So that farming >kills logic is bs\n\nAll my downvotes are from : Bot mains so far.

So it checks with only with Zilean 1 tricks? \n\nMeh Im sure Riot only cares about farming. My proof is the aram games. Even going 20 0 0 you only get A-  because you did not farm enough.","replies":[{"poster":"Mysticman89","date":"2018-03-18T00:08:49.791+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, it doesn't care about your rank/mmr, that's just a common assumption people make without actually having looked into it.\n\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/bZL8vAWw-champion-mastery-qa?comment=000f0000\n\nA loose explanation for why it works out is because silver mmr players are playing against silver mmr players, diamond vs diamond and so on, so while silver players may make a lot more mistakes, silver players get punished for those mistakes far less, and it loosely cancels out.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ExHentai","date":"2018-03-17T23:20:30.540+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=OP Garen Support,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=6crnNrXA,comment-id=0000000000000000,timestamp=2018-03-17T23:15:53.762+0000)\n>\n> Wasnt it that it only checks with tiers? bronze, silver ,gold , etc\n\nGrades in ARAM wouldn't make any sense if that was the case.
