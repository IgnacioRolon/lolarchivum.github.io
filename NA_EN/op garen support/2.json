But here is the newest input from riot :https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/general-discussion/27mrj62T-give-us-an-update-of-whats-coming-this-mid-season-dont-leave-us-in-the-shadows\n\n**Riot Axes:**\nSure. Gonna talk more problem statement stuff than exact details but those'll be coming in the next couple weeks.\n\nOne thing to note is that we're doing less of a giant midseason release this year. Changes will come over a couple of patches, and it'll be smaller scope - there's no Runes Reforged or Elemental Drakes in this one. The changes that are there are likely to be significant, though. Likely to see changes aimed directly at Marksmen on 8.10 or 8.11, possibly both depending when work is finished, and then possible (but definitely not guaranteed) Fighter work in a follow-up patch.\n\nWe're looking at Marksmen with a few values:\n\n    The mere fact of getting to two items shouldn't guarantee they're the most valuable champion on a team, but getting ahead should matter a lot.\n    They need to be able to buy early items that ensure they can be fun, have responsive inputs (shoot-step-shoot is pretty unpleasant with no AS), and contribute appropriately. I take that to mean they need to get Attack Speed, potentially movement speed (though less required), and at least some punchy, powerful hits.\n    We're going to be looking for ways to play up the difference between a snowballing champion and one that's merely on the curve - that includes Fighters, Assassins, ADCs, and Mages (though we think Mages are actually more correct than the other three - if they're behind, they provide primarily utility, if they're ahead they can be great damage carries). We'll especially value any time we can hit multiple of these classes with shared items - e.g. items that help both Fighters and Marksmen, or Assassins and Marksmen.\n    Some opportunistic stuff - e.g. reducing the burst damage of very late game Infinity Edge builds to other squishy champions.\n\nThis will probably mean significant reworks to Infinity Edge, Essence Reaver, Last Whisper/Lord Dominik's Regards, cost changes to things like Phantom Dancer, possibly a new item, likely buffs to some underperforming items, plus some ADC base stat changes.\n","replies":[{"poster":"Häxel","date":"2018-04-18T17:04:54.826+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":11,"body":">  Likely to see changes aimed directly at Marksmen on 8.10 or 8.11, possibly both depending when work is finished, and then possible (but definitely not guaranteed) Fighter work in a follow-up patch.\n\nWhy you now rant liek all these other guys if you even have here the proof that it is **not** that riot will also handle adcs, but just 1, 2 patches later? \n\n**Ofcourse** the boards are full of \"Whatabout\" claims while crying that one broke class gets tuned a bit earlier for them to see as the other classes.\nJust cause some clasess are broken **doesn't** justify that your calss can also be broken. Just means riot ahs to do stuff on a bunch of classes in general there they ahve shipped problems over the years: Cdr and free mana for everyone (funny that with less mana even if you go 45% cdr you hurt yourself if you spam without thinking), adc, mage and support itemization while toplane items still got kinda left behind, all these powercreep or focusing on just competive fused to some heavy inbalance. \n\nBut saying Riot has destroyed the game and everytime they try to fix some classes same time crying over how unjustified it is to nerf \"my beloved class\" doesn't help anything.","replies":[{"poster":"OP Garen Support","date":"2018-04-18T17:41:58.946+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":3,"body":"Mages are not broken.

Assassins also are a natural counter to Marksmen and they're nowhere to be found. Buffing Lethality isn't making things better because then the Assassins overtake the role/position and make everyone's life miserable, having to be nerfed yet again. And then certain champions who can use Lethality that aren't Assassins, rise to power unintentionally.\n\nAssassins got their Duskblade nerfs/compensation buffs to make sure that Duskblade isn't such a powerful first purchase and that their power level doesn't depend on this item. Now Riot's looking into other potential changes, like Mages that can super waveclear everything and still roam a lot for successful ganks.\n\nThird reason that you're not considering is that Riot's likely also trying to lay some groundwork for potential bot lane meta changes that would allow some mages to be primary carries there and replace some Marksmen. Allowing these bot mages to outdamage, outpoke and outtrade everyone due to how mana isn't such a big issue anymore, could be one of the concerns there. It may also increase the duration of the laning phase for mid laners, due to some items getting a bit more expensive.\n\nThat also leaves bot and top lane with a bit more time to stay and farm, actually increasing the game duration slightly. You're not even looking how this change can have an impact from a few different perspectives, all because they're not directly nerfing Marksmen because you think they need to be. And surprise surprise, they're also doing that as well.","replies":[{"poster":"OP Garen Support","date":"2018-04-19T12:29:18.262+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Assassins are not struggling wtf are you talking about?

Then... rather than gut tanks like what's currently being done, rework more of their basic farming abilities so that their damage to minions stays the same, but their damage to CHAMPS with the same abilities is lower... think rumble q but in reverse. This would bring adc's more into line with other champs, help non-tank toplaners w/o having to gut tanks, and also help opponents who are jumped on by a tank not have to worry so much about being blown up while still rewarding the tank by allowing them to be tanky.\n\nKaboom.

Either they go full tank and are only useful for the cc they bring, or they hope to 1-shot adc and win fight off that. If they can't, any damage they do is irrelevant because... lifesteal and healing via support items and  the fact that with even just a single peeling ability from one teammate, the adc cannot be caught again unless you have infinite gapclosers like akali. Unlike past seasons, you largely cannot afford to focus anyone but the adc unless both sides focus the frontline. Well when that happens, bruisers and fighters get screwed because their dps to to tanks isn't enough to outweigh the extra damage they take from the enemy team compared to what the enemy tank takes in damage from your team. Thus... league of tanks top - barring ranged or splitpush full damage champs with extreme safety in lane like vlad, gp, camille are the norm for most of season.\n\nIt doesn't take a genius to figure it out, but I don't think Riot has. It's like how they took half a season to figure out how to nerf tank ekko when he was broken. Hmmm... a full tank (except triforce) champ is doing too much damage and can stick to enemies better than anyone else (at the time). How do we deal with this... Nerf is base damage? No, that would never work. We're going to try this first. That just made him stronger? .... half a season later... we nerfed ekko's base damage and buffed his ap scaling to incentivize him to go ap.

Ah, boards are talking about subjects they don't understand again. Mages went from being a role with mana as a resource to a brainless spam fest on mid ever since they kept adding more mana to items on top of having runes like Manaflow band. Over the years mages have been made so much easier for any brainless monkey that can press 2 buttons in lane to clear the wave.\n\n> Mid feels shit.\n\nThat's a very subjective observation buddy.
