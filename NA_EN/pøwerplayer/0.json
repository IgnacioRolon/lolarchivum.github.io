Wouldn't it be great if we could get the pre-death Sion skin, don't know about you fellas but honestly, I'd like to see that.  Concept art of Sion's pre-death head looks pretty neat, along with a massive sculpture that we had in \"Reborn\" that represents his living state. Anyways, would be cool if you guys could support this idea by commenting or something, just so we could get Riot's attention. Regardless, would love to hear other people's thoughts!\n\n\n____\nAn update! Being a bit late with this but.. better late than never, right?\nWe got a couple of answers from the Q&amp;A that was held a few days ago!\n\nIronStylus's answer http://puu.sh/bUigI/8ee51ab190.png\nFruity's answer http://puu.sh/bUmfL/97d4c71526.png\n\nNothing got confirmed really, but it's nice knowing that they like it too.\n\n\n____\nLast \"update\" of sorts.\n\nWell it saddens me that whole two years have passed since I've posted this and no concrete statement has been made. All I can do is hope that someone, somewhere at Riot's headquarters is still thinking of this and is nudging their co-workers with the idea. I haven't forgotten about it and I hope those of you that did support it, back then, haven't either.\nHopefully we do get this skin sometime in the near future.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Scruffy","date":"2014-09-29T23:12:38.004+0000","up_votes":53,"down_votes":0,"body":"I seriously want nothing more.
