The first hit me for a reasonable 71 damage which I still thought was a bit high, the second one hit me for 223 mixed damage and basically one shot the last slight over quarter of my HP I had left.  Both of us were stunned (she literally stopped moving for several seconds and just stood there) and I have not been able to find a way for her to possibly have hit for so much.  Even assuming that the first hit proced her Conqueror, and not the AA before it which I had thought triggered it, I could not find a way for her to fit 223 damage within a single q at level 2, even with Conqueror, Scorch (which I don't even know/think she took) the bonus AD from conqueror, her fully stacked passive, etc, I could not find a way for it to be hitting for more than 110-120 damage, or about half of what I took.
