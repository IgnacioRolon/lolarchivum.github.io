She hasn't been for quite a long time. Are you one of those people that ask her why she isn't building Warmog's at 20 minutes? A popular skill route for Soraka is actually to start Q, then go into E depending on the situation, then take W and start maxing it.\n\nIn fact, a lot of people lose against her because they underestimate her bully potential early game. That's also why building an Executioner's Calling on the first back to try to counter her ends in a disaster. Actually, for most of this season she was an oppressive lane bully with E silence poke. Her heal alone isn't what makes Soraka deadly either. That's just what people in low ELO focus on. Her AoE silence is the most powerful ability in her kit and a hard counter to a lot of assassins and ults if she can use it wisely and position herself correctly.\n\nAs for her stats, according to u.gg 5.8% pick rate in Platinum+, which is nothing to scoff at. She is a popular pick for support, even among enchanters, so I don't know what you're talking about.\n\nTo OP's main point, yes we do need less damage, especially bot lane. Damage supports are what is making the situation bot lane so volatile and almost unplayable. The other issue is one-sided camps from the jungler that they're rewarded for doing.\n\nI don't know if Riot's main objective is to create a damage focused bot lane. Let's look at Yuumi for example. She's a caricature of what people like the person I'm quoting _think_ enchanters are. \n\nThey think they do nothing and contribute little and only should heal and throw out minimal CC. They're right about one thing, enchanters are easy to play mechanically speaking for the most part, but so are a lot of other champions. What makes an enchanter difficult to play is that they're often the number one target on the team while being squishy and not doing a lot of damage, so they need to pay close attention to positioning and their safety. They need to risk themselves to protect teammates at the same time.\n\nDoes Yuumi have to do that? No. She's incredibly safe to play and doesn't have to interact. Riot eliminated the weaknesses of the enchanter role, which means she can either be an OP must ban like she was earlier in the season, or she can be largely irrelevant like she is now. That's bad design.

This was literally their words during their design notes.\n* Riot reduced the impact of players having to work as a team, and increased players selfishly depending on themselves. Solo queue ranked is a big contributor to this.\n* No voice comms further increases the divide between players. Might as well hide away all your teammate names and make chatting a non feature at this rate.\n* Focusing game and visual design more on getting the casual anime audience and pushing out the PC strategy audience. This includes pushing chests and skin sales in favor of smarter game design. The moment this happened, that PC player with some experience in other RTS was replaced with a 12 year old that is playing fortnite and minecraft.\n\nBack in early seasons, each player came to the game knowing that there was an overall strategy to play out and everyone had a role to play. There was a carry, a tank, one or two supports, and someone to take jungle camps, making three solo lanes, and 1 duo lane. Supports and junglers spent their income on vision control, carries farmed to try to get to their damage items, and the tank held a lane to farm up defensive items. Nowadays, you can have five carries and still win games off that alone due to the free damage and gold given to everyone.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ActionWildman","date":"2019-11-12T18:52:41.171+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol people told me as an AD main to shut up and accept change but look now.
