She feels so satisfying to play as and has a fun-to-use ultimate.\r\nJungle: {{champion:28}}. Being invisible for long periods of time gives you that &quot;hah! Nobody knows where i am!&quot; feeling which i love to have.\r\nMid: {{champion:127}} Not a popular pick but definently my favorite, her Q gaining bonus range off minions feels very cool and her {{summoner:4}}+W is a fun combo.\r\nADC: {{champion:21}} Excecuting minions with her Q, then having it bounce to the enemy and take half their health is just the most &quot;haha&quot; feeling ever.\r\nSupport: {{champion:163}} its really hard to narrow it down since i love so many supports, but her powerspike at level 3 is simply amazing on a support and can sometimes gauruntee a kill.\r\n\r\nWhat do you guys think?","replies":[{"poster":"Handy Sandy ","date":"2017-04-16T00:14:26.372+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Top: {{champion:111}} It's so fun building one armor or magic resist item for the laning phase and then stop taking any damage from them! \n\nJg: {{champion:7}} I've done this a couple times with attack speed runes instead of AP ones.

It makes your losing chances a lot higher. If you get him there, go full ap runes, the E alone can harm really badly the squishies even at level 3, you have a very high chance of winning the match.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DarkRitual","date":"2017-04-16T00:53:17.867+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:432}} for any role.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RageQ2","date":"2017-04-16T00:03:06.074+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Support for me would be {{champion:35}} , The countless amount of times that I've tricked an adc or support into my boxes is hilarious, It's extremely fun playing around the minds of your opponents and makes you look like you are a genius when you outplay them.","replies":[{"poster":"Asayake 5150glow","date":"2017-04-16T00:33:13.983+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RageQ2,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=lFpBkzI5,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2017-04-16T00:03:06.074+0000)\n>\n> Support for me would be {{champion:35}} , The countless amount of times that I&#x27;ve tricked an adc or support into my boxes is hilarious, It&#x27;s extremely fun playing around the minds of your opponents and makes you look like you are a genius when you outplay them.\n\nSorry dude, the truth is people rarely think of you as a genius, they just rage at what you did and rage at Shaco's kit :P\n\nWhen they calm down sometimes people will acknowledge that you were a genius but most won't.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Karfuss","date":"2017-04-16T00:26:48.366+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:8}} : TOP\n{{champion:8}} : MID\n{{champion:35}} : JUNGLE\n{{champion:18}}  : ADC\n{{champion:89}}  : SUPPORT","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-04-16T00:24:37.923+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:105}} \n{{champion:432}} \n{{champion:105}} \n{{champion:432}} \n{{champion:432}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"franchise7676","date":"2017-04-16T00:03:39.295+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"WW top just much fun 1 v 1\ntwitch jung surprise\nkarthus mid can gank all lanes at once\nlulu support no one dies\nvayne 1 v 4 no prob","replies":[]},{"poster":"stone the blacks","date":"2017-04-16T00:02:21.404+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:36}} Goes where he pleases, no matter the role","replies":[]}]}
