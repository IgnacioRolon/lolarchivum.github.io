I hate the \"double buff ASAP then gank\" meta. I like counter jungling, I like messing with the opposing jungler, but there's not much to do when they are just rushing both buffs and ganking. All I can do is rush my buffs and gank and/or countergank. It's not fun. Unfortunately I don't know how to fix it or even why it started being this way in the first place, because it didn't used to be like this.
