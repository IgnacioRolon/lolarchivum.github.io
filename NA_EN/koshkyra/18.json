BTW gonna add this in as a general statement to anyone. Yes duskblade is stupid but this is what happens when we gut ad assassin kits this hard riot has to make insane items like this so they can actually function.\n\n> When old LeBlanc had to do a full rotation at short range to burst a squishy it was considered &amp;quot;unhealthy&amp;quot; and they reworked her to where she has to die before getting her burst off, and needs to buy Gunblade+LichBane to be able to burst a target down.\n\nShort compared to other ap champions sure but it wasn't that short especially considering she has a dash and her burst was fast. \n\nThey reworked her because most people hated playing against her and they have no avenues to buff her when he playstyle is oh hi im here and you are now dead. \n\n\n> When current Talon/Nocturne/Draven (dravens an assassin at this point) AA you once  and kill you, theres apparentally nothing wrong with that and considered balanced, while LeBlanc is constantly complained about.\n\nThis literally isn't happening which is why no one is complaining about it. You won't see complaints about hyperbole people complain about reality. In reality they all use most of their kit when killing you unless they are insanely fed which riot doesn't balance around. People have only really complained about draven. Recently most people on this forum who post about leblanc want old leblanc back.\n\n\n> &amp;quot;omg she just has to hit her global chain and then i die!
