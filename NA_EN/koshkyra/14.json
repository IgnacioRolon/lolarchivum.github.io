The whole message thing only happens if YOUR report gets them flagged, otherwise you don't get any message.\n\nReports do help, as it evident by the many people on this board crying about their suspensions/bans. Just don't respond to people being jackasses in game, mute them if you need to, then report them after the game and move on with your life.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-12-20T14:17:45.075+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You aren't always given the message that someone was punished even if your report led to a punishment.\n\nThere was one time that a friend and I both reported a message, I got the message and he didn't. There was another game where we both reported the same player again and we both got the message.\n\nBasically just report and move on with your life.
