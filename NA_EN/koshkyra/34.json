All popular characters that are constantly popular in the pub scene no matter what their actual state of balance is.

Occam's Razor is used to simplify a situation into something more manageable but sometimes that situation simply can't be simplified as much as we want. \n\nAnd honestly: It sounds like you harbor the same kind of bias Riot does but in the opposite direction, and somehow that makes you more correct to hold it? How are you going to accuse them of bias while you hold your own so strongly? The boards demands the game to be balanced for casual play but lo and behold when people resort to pulling out competitive stats to prove their point and isolated statistics that can be used in many different ways. \n\nI can go to champion.gg, as an example, and tell you that Lee's damage isn't as crazy as everyone says: he's ranked 33 of 39 in terms of jungler damage output, so therefore his damage shouldn't be touched, right? But that's too narrow to speak on, isn't it? He also dies a lot (26/39) despite claims that he seems to be impossible to catch and kill. Those statistics would be flawed in your eyes, and yet you do the same with pick rate. You pick and choose what statistics are convenient to you and go from there. \n\nYou want me to be honest? I could see Lee getting a bit of a love tap, but he doesn't need much more. It sounds like you're so biased you can't see him possibly being balanced despite the fact that he very well can be.

Lee is problematic for the exact same reason as champions like Azir, Ekko, Thresh, Camille, Yasuo, Elise, Jayce and Nidalee. They all quite simply do too much. Until Riot is willing to outright remove elements of their kits I seriously doubt any of them will be remotely balancable. At best the swing wildly between overpowered and garbage, at worst they're perpetually overpowered as Lee Sin and Elise have been for a long time now.\n\n>Gutting Lee is not the answer: giving everyone else equal treatment to Lee is, in my opinion. \n\nEqual treatment flows both ways. Even if Riot legitimately changes their philosophy I think Lee Sin is a massive outstanding case. The simple fact is that under their current philosophy Lee Sin should have been put in the dumpster 3+ years ago. It's actually quite insulting to players who did see their main champs get dumpstered with excuses like the infamous \"time out of the spotlight\" quote used as justification to not ever see that applied to Lee Sin and worse yet see Riot go out and defend Lee Sin with bullshit like \"we like Lee Sin because we think he's a fun champion to watch\". \n\nAs someone who does and did main Sejuani at the time when she was gutted I find the idea that Lee Sin should be allowed to escape Riot's policy of gutting, even if they later change that policy utterly insulting and disgusting.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Anidan","date":"2017-04-11T02:40:42.945+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"_now_ we can agree. I also think that other champions should be balanced to the same standard as all of the rest. Riot is definitely showing bias toward certain champions, Lee among them (which you probably noted I said they did). That said, I personally think the rest of the roster should be balanced more similarly to Lee, where they're careful not to hit him too hard or buff him too much on any given single pass. Gutting Lee is not the answer: giving everyone else equal treatment to Lee is, in my opinion. Obviously nobody should have to fear that their favorite champion will be unusable, and some designs are just outright bad for the game, like Azir, but Lee is actually not on that list of poor designs, in my opinion. He just seems like it because he's so routinely dominant, but that's on Riot, not Lee. His kit is pretty good about rewarding skill, while giving you plenty of room to screw up--that's perfectly fine. He should maybe have some of his consistency hit, but otherwise he's fine. Other champions need to be balanced as carefully as Lee tends to be. What happened to Sejuani, as you brought up, was completely unfair to Sejuani and the people that played her, and the justification Riot used was unfair to absolutely everybody, since being treated unfairly better is still unfair treatment, just not negative unfair treatment. It was a slap to the face to everyone. \n\nI wholly agree that Riot needs to balance everyone more akin to Lee with careful measures rather than the whole \"they had their time in spotlight\" balance mentality.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Blåbæret","date":"2017-04-10T20:47:52.071+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Carl Grimes TWD1,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=yXeEPedo,comment-id=000100000000,timestamp=2017-04-10T17:49:22.524+0000)\n>\n> The solution to that is buff and/or make other champions more &quot;fun&quot; to play.
