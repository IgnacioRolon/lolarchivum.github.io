Both playing with and playing against.\nAgainst: positioning is useless. You are **always** in range of a sudden dive. If you get poked by the enemy support and can't win an all-in right now, then you have to back immediately.\nAlongside: Oh look Tristana just went in for the kill. Oh look, Tristana died before you could even get there. Oh look, Tristana's flaming you for not blowing flash to backup her surprise all-in.\nI would recommend people not pick her ever when playing with randos. With good communication with the support she could be good, but without it your lane goes from a 2v2 to 2 consecutive 2v1 matches.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Aatrox Mid 1v5","date":"2017-12-02T23:11:11.271+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"People kill her before her jump animation has a chance to play.","replies":[{"poster":"McFatal","date":"2017-12-02T23:17:29.771+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=free software,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=NjaAxfVJ,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2017-12-02T23:11:11.271+0000)\n>\n> People kill her before her jump animation has a chance to play.\n\nhahahaahahahahahaahahahahahaha\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nxd","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"PopcornBunni","date":"2017-12-02T23:14:37.196+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because {{champion:67}} {{champion:29}} {{champion:96}} exist as better lategame pentakill machines\n\nAnd because {{champion:67}} {{champion:81}} {{champion:21}} {{champion:110}} {{champion:119}}   exist as better early harass characters.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jinzo Torrance","date":"2017-12-02T23:12:58.122+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I will forget to play this game until ADC are nerfed","replies":[]},{"poster":"Azadethe","date":"2017-12-02T23:04:41.702+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly? because the new runes opened the doors for MANY broken possibilities. As the masses start to spam those broken rune combinations and conform to them, we see more and more complaints about them.\n\nFor example, atm MF and Vayne are more consistent 1 sec killers than Trist because now MF's PASSIVE procs a rune effect for double tapped first hit damage, followed by a huge Coup de gras damage bonus on Q. There are also assassins hitting 1 hit strides with no real counterplay, and good farmers are abusing Dark Harvest to get 2-3 on hit non stat based damage procs (Duskblade, Dark Harvest, Muramana) in addition to their built in damage. \n\nThat's stacking higher in priority for people than the complaints that just say, \"ADC's stack crit/zeal items too fast and can outrange.\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"McFatal","date":"2017-12-02T23:02:36.086+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"no one forgot about vayne/tristana/twitch/kogmaw/ezreal.\n\nsome just got tired of asking the balance team to do their job and gave up.\n\ni personally dont care anymore. the game continues to become worse in terms of balance and gameplay and riot doesnt seem to be doing anything about it except making it worse with the new runes and lack of attention towards bruisers for 3 seasons and NOW the release of Zoe.","replies":[]},{"poster":"kaironen","date":"2017-12-02T22:57:30.862+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:18}}  hasn't been broken until they buffed the crit items by reducing the cost and also having the {{item:3087}}  + {{item:3094}}  combo. Tristana right now is probably a little too strong due to the interaction, crit buffs, and press the attack synergizing extremely well with her. Also, I think that she isn't the main problem currently. Champions like ezreal, mf, vayne, twitch are stronger than her right now. I also think that  {{champion:51}}  is really strong but most people that I say she is op to think she's balanced so maybe that's just me.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2017-12-02T22:49:11.423+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"because there's more important things for people to complain about.\n\n\nThey complain about anything there is to complain about, but at least they seem to have a decency to complain about more important matters.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Durzaka","date":"2017-12-02T23:17:35.999+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"because the game shifted and she isnt as strong anymore.\n\nShe works, but with the shift away from enchanter supports, and ardent censer meta, she isnt a god anymore.","replies":[]}]}
