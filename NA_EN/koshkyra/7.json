As much as people hate the class, it is by a large margin, the most important class in the game right now. Although the ADC in your situation was being rude af, it makes sense that Zilean can be useful without CS. His kit can still do what it does without him getting a new item. The slow, the ult (although having AP ratios), the Q stun is largely unaffected by Zilean having more gold. It's a different story when your ADC has more gold and is an item over the enemy ADC cuz their entire kit is based around right clicking. It's sad that team fights are lost simply because your ADC doesn't have lord dominiks but they do. Your ADC doesn't have the IE, Shiv, RFC power spike but they do etc. \n\nBottom line: Riot needs to buff other laners to be as important as ADC so they can carry the game in their own ways.
