Riot likes skill-scaling-power champs that scale with the mechanics, but {{champion:142}} {{champion:157}} have been pure toxic cancer for the user base at various points.  A real Invoker-style champ in League would be a game-changer, and it would be quite challenging to balance the high skill and *moderate* power levels required without making the champ feel too-hard and unrewarding.\n\nStill though...a six-mode shapeshifter mage, at least?

Are there any plans to make new champions with simple and easy playstyles?_\n___\n___\n#A\n_Simple, straightforward champs have a lot of pros and cons, but overall we agree that they are an important and fun part of the LoL roster. The big benefit is that it opens up a more decision-based and less input-mechanics-based playstyle that’s really appealing to some types of players (especially new ones). A cost and common drawback is that they’re often much more powerful in low elo play, so when balanced, they end up being a non-viable option in higher levels of play. Simple champions can also devolve much more quickly into “stat check” gameplay when they’re snowballed ahead or behind because they don’t have enough tools to outplay their opponents._\n\n_To answer your original question—**we will likely not be adding a lot more of the “old Taric” style of champions to the game** because we think that the amount we have right now is serving that niche pretty well. In the cases of VGUs, we are trying to keep the simple champs simple when we can. I think Warwick was a good example of this, where we made a lot of good changes to his kit without pushing it into a high mechanics space._\n\n___\n\nSo don't expect new champions to have simple kits.","replies":[]},{"poster":"flibitydoo","date":"2018-07-07T06:21:59.278+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"That champ looks like a balance nightmare\n\nyou'd have to focus all of it's damage power to it's Q since it is it's only damaging basic ability.\n\nWhich means periodically it's going to get it's Q to nuke people super hard once it's amped up by it's passive and E.

I want to see people have to choose actives or stats; less synergy in favor of diversity. More utility will lead to bigger plays.

Champions like Lulu shouldn't be allowed to be \"good\" because the amount of brainpower it takes to absolutely counter any sort of aggression is laughable at best. Lulu has ONE skillshot in her entire kit meaning you can only actually play around ONE ability. If you dive on Lulu and she happens to hover over you and hit W or hits R on herself you are going to die because she happened to click a few buttons. Back when Lulu+Kog was INCREDIBLY strong (5.0 as kog with ardent) you could honestly play Lulu and hardly look at the screen and just put your cursor over kog's portrait in the bottom right and spam W and E (they had almost 100% uptime anyway and you had infinite mana regen from support items).\n\nAlso, another thing is generalist champions also shouldn't be able to outclass dedicated specialists in their own field. Lulu who is much more aggressive than the likes of Janna (who is a problem in her own right) shouldn't be able to peel as well as her, yet against 1-2 divers can easily get the job done just as well since W and R are both huge \"no\" buttons. Her shield which can double as damage shouldn't be remotely as strong as Janna's yet time and time again has been on the same playing field while still providing damage at the same time (that also doesn't get removed when the shield drops).\n\nEnchanter supports until the class gets reworked just doesn't ever feel \"fair\" to play against if they are good. Like the fact that when strong Karma could easily outshield most of a teamfight mage's damage by using R+E and still having a Locket available isn't fun. We can lure the entire enemy team into a choke where I land a bullseye 5 man Ziggs ult and Karma hitting R+E and negating over half of the total damage on a MUCH shorter cooldown where you just have to kind of pay attention isn't interactive. It isn't NEARLY as bad now that you can't just pre-emptively shield everything THAT easily, but it will still be annoying since the only way to \"play around\" massive shields from supports it seems is to play at 5 AM and hope that Lulu starts dozing off a little bit in the game.","replies":[{"poster":"HaIlMonitor","date":"2018-07-08T06:05:16.617+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To be fair Lulu and Karma takes way more skill then someone like Janna to play. If they miss their one skill-shot or use skills the wrong way they become way less effective. I play a ton of assassins and to be honest I know if I face either of them they are dangerous, and I am okay with that. \n\nLulu cant 1 shot me, nor can she kill a tank. All she can do is make it so I cant do my job properly, but do you know who is way worst to play vs? Garen, Tryndamere, Darius or Tahm Kench. They actually just sit there doing nothing well you die which is a true joke.  Some enchanters are braindead and easy to play, but Lulu and karma are way more enjoyable to play vs then Janna who stops everyone and everything in their tracks, or brand or Zyra who can actually solo carry games.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Beacon Academy","date":"2018-07-07T09:46:14.493+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yea...

Enemy champions are Mutilated for 3 seconds, reducing all Heal power healing and shielding on them by 40%.\nDeathbringer Stance's cooldown is reduced by 2 seconds when Aatrox casts an ability or hits a champion with the edge of The Darkin Blade The Darkin Blade.\n\nThe Darkin Blade\tTARGET RANGE: 650 / 525 EFFECT RADIUS: 200 COOLDOWN: 16 / 15 / 14 / 13 / 12\nAatrox swings his greatsword in the target direction, striking enemies in a line. The Darkin Blade can then be reactivated twice within 4 seconds, with the second cast refreshing the timer. The second cast strikes enemies in a cone and the third in the target area.\nEach cast deals physical damage, increasing by 25% on the second cast and 50% on the third. The Darkin Blade deals 65% - 100% (based on level) damage to minions.\nHitting enemies at the far end of the first two casts and the center of the third deals 50% bonus damage and Airborne icon knocks up enemies for 0.25 seconds.\nMonsters take 10% AD bonus damage and are Airborne icon knocked up for 0.5 seconds instead.\n\nInfernal Chains\nAatrox smashes the ground in the target direction, creating a chain that stops on the first enemy hit, dealing physical damage, doubled against minions, and slowing them for 1.5 seconds.\nIf Infernal Chains hits a champion or large monster, they are chained to the impact area. If the chained enemy is still in the impact area after 1.5 seconds, they are dragged to the center and take the same damage again.\n\nUmbral Dash\nAatrox Heal power heals for percentage of the post-mitigation-physical damage he deals, with a 33% effectiveness against non-champions.\nAdditionally, Aatrox periodically stores a Umbral Dash charge, up to 2 stored at once.\nAatrox Dash dashes in the target direction, gaining Attack damage icon bonus attack damage for 1.5 seconds.\nUmbral Dash resets Aatrox's basic attack timer and can be cast during his other spell casts without interruption.\n\nWorld Ender\nAatrox unleashes his true demonic form for 12 seconds, fearing nearby allied and enemy minions for 3 seconds, and for the first second gaining bonus movement speed.\nWhile transformed Aatrox gains increased size and (20% AD) bonus attack damage, refreshing the bonus movement speed when out-of-combat with champions and turrets.\nAatrox generates Blood Well equal to 15% - 50% (based on duration) of his maximum health over the first 10 seconds. Taking lethal damage during World Ender revives Aatrox over 3.25 seconds, during which he is untargetable, pacified and slowed by 25% and consumes the Blood Well to recover the same amount in health.\n\n#Vs Annie\n\nPyromania\nAnnie gains a stack of Pyromania when she casts a spell, up to a maximum of 4.

The stab deals 50% damage to minions and monsters beyond the closest.\nIf Pyke is interrupted during the charge, or the charge completes without reactivation, Bone Skewer is cancelled and the ability is put on full cooldown but refunds Mana icon half the mana cost.\n\nGhostwater Dive\t\nPyke enters Ambush 2 camouflage and gains Movement speed icon bonus movement speed that decays over 5 seconds. Enemies are notified if Pyke is within X-units of them.\nAttacking or casting abilities immediately ends Ambush 2 camouflage.\n\nPhantom Undertow\t\nPyke Dash dashes, leaving behind a drowned phantom.\nAfter 1 second, the phantom returns to Pyke, dealing physical damage and Stun icon stunning enemy champions it passes through.\n\n\nDeath from Below\t\nAfter a 0.75-second delay, Pyke strikes in an X-shaped area, executing enemies below 200 - 605 (based on level) (+ 80% bonus AD) health while dealing the same amount as physical damage to enemies not within the threshold for execution.\nIf Death from Below hits an enemy champion, Pyke will blink to the center of the X.

When every new kit is given so much stuff that they end up doing much of the same, e.g. AoE damage, AoE CC (especially displacement), and mobility, the end result isn't particularly diverse. Similarly, when a kit tries to be complex just for the sake of being complex, rather than because that complexity brings greater health, the product is a champion that is more difficult to balance or fix in the longer term, as they have many more moving parts to take into account. Complexity can and does bring opportunities for more depth, but only if used properly and sparingly. Currently, a lot of kits are pretty gratuitously complex, and that mechanical overload has often been directly responsible for their downfall.\n\nI think it's also worth bringing in a little more perspective on this matter: League isn't the only MOBA on the market, and there are plenty of other games that manage to have a large roster of characters, characters that stand out from each other while often retaining simple, intuitive kits. HotS is probably the best example of this, but Dota 2 also has a whole bunch of heroes that are extremely simple, yet full of depth (it also has some _really_ complex ones too, though their complexity has a purpose). Smite has the issue of having a lot of samey effects (especially dashes), but still has a lot of distinct kits whose abilities can each usually be described in a couple of sentences. This is just within the MOBA genre, and there are plenty more games beyond that which demonstrate how to extract a ton of depth from a minimal amount of complexity. We could all benefit from looking at these other games, and thereby realizing that the complexity we've experienced in League is not a necessity, but an ongoing developer choice that hasn't panned out all that well.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Warlord Rhinark","date":"2018-07-07T06:21:54.260+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"#Fucking minigames","replies":[]},{"poster":"Aloe Plant","date":"2018-07-07T03:56:52.636+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i believe this kind of thinking will be used as they keep updating champions, for example nunu, hopefully it helps them realize that a new champion thats straight forward can still be fun","replies":[]}]}
