I was a victim of this last season in my first ranked games.  I had scores like 2-10, 0-7, 1-9 and didn't even finish the placement matches because clearly I wasn't ready.  When I checked my opponents profile, some of them were gold the previous season while most were silver.  Some new ranked players can hold their own in Silver, some can't.  The ones who can't, usually get demoted to Bronze.  But overall, I agree with you.  Unranked players should start in Bronze 2-3 and go up to Silver..even Gold if they win a certain amount of games.  There's too many people jumping into ranked after they hit 30 with no custom runes going 0-11 against Silver/Gold players.  But it's not their fault though.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Raknyshonchau","date":"2018-05-06T00:31:30.213+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think your understanding of the Bronze - Silver tiers is misconstrued. \n\nAnyone in bronze with over 200 games played across all seasons is a below average player. Silver is EXACTLY where new players who go 5-5 in placements or better should be placed.\n\nPlayers who go 0/10 do not get Silver 3 that is simply untrue.
