Most of them will have Morello which negates healing even further; the gold is just not worth the stats against the burst / grievous wounds / dot dmg.. It feels terrible to buy any of them because it rarely makes a difference, Dark Harvest is a thing as well, you don't even have to hit more than 2/3 spells to do enough damage later on in the game (Or 1 in case you're Karthus jungle, because spamming R and scaling your DH is a thing ). \n\nIt doesn't matter if you're immobile though, not all ADC's have a dash either. Most mages have slows/snares/stuns or the likes on one or more spells in their kit, that's usually plenty to keep someone at bay unless they flash on you -- but that's how it works for ADC's too. You can't say the CD's are long, they are not. You'd think that mana issues would be relevant, but not even that. I just want to be able to play ADC (Jinx, Twitch, Kalista) again without feeling like I'm handicapping myself. I'm spamming Zyra support at the moment on this acc just to prove a point. Frostfang needs a nerf so people will quit spamming mages on support and having the most dmg dealt at the end of all games while getting items at the same pace as midlaners would. Beyond that, it'd just be nice if the dmg output would get nerfed overall.
