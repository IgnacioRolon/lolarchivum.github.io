My fps is usually in 60-80 during games, the only problem I have is during champion select.\r\n\r\nDuring champion select, all noises I hear from the game is distorted.\r\nLet's say I banned ekko, I would hear:\r\n\r\n\"You (glitch noise) use (glitch noise)d to be (glitch noice) co (glitch noise)ol\"\r\n\r\n(As opposed to \"you used to be cool\")\r\n\r\nIf I picked lissandra, I would hear:\r\n\r\n\"I (unknown noise) will bu (glitching)ry the w-o-r-l-d in (glitch noise) ice.\"\r\n\r\n(As opposed to \"I will bury the world in ice\")\r\n\r\nWhen it's my turn to pick someone, all I hear is a loud glitching noise followed by the very ending of the \"it's your turn to pick\" noise.\r\n\r\nI don't know why this is happening. It is definently not a lag issue, help?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-10T01:00:14.439+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It seems like this might be caused by some corrupted sound files in your league directory.

Back in patch 7.1 (I think), I had the same issue, then it stopped. Now in this patch it's doing it again.\n\nIt'll be fine for a while but after playing a few games, the sound will deteriorate and become distorted, until no sounds in the Client work whatsoever.\n\nEverything else works fine without lag or delay in the client.","replies":[]}]}
