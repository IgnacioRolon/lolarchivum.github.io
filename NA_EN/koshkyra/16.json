On the other hand, I believe it is intended to kill you unless you are at least even with her and have itemized some defenses.\n\nAlso the nerfs made it easier to avoid being hit by her E and easier to avoid being hit by Q in the absence of E.\n\nI am hearing a lot about her feeling clunkier now, but I don't understand why. She was always meant to be seen and vulnerable before her q hits, and she generally was for new players, and know she is for everyone.\n\nRiot seems to be handling things pretty fairly in my opinion, she just has that sort of muh-skillcap game play that a lot of people do not enjoy playing against yet is the simplest method to reduce \"stat checkiness\" in non-utility champions.","replies":[{"poster":"Tykenn","date":"2018-01-14T15:45:07.735+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"One thing I disagree with is that Zoe is not for new players, she's much more akin to Zed. Anyone can play her, but it comes in the combos that set apart the great and mediocre. The removal of this interaction has lowered the skill ceiling drastically, the ultimate now is a noob trap, the only real use for it is to look over walls and nothing else.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Azadethe","date":"2018-01-14T14:19:52.584+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Sorry. I erase Zoe when i play against her, and I usually fall short of Q's when I play her. Her kit is one of the most unreliable in the game, even if your aim is dead on. The nerfs to E just pretty much ruined her. It's almost useless now. Most of her presence now comes from items, not from skills (Lich bane autos). She's playing more like Karma or Ziggs with a Lich bane now. Q and Auto. Q and Auto.","replies":[]}]}
