However, since being positive is an active *choice* (you can't always win, period) even in the face of emotional adversity, you have more agency in that regard.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"e46 Fanatic","date":"2017-05-08T00:55:24.061+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"I just won 7 matches with 2 losses in between, had to honor all players on my team for the reason this post is made.

He was relentless, going after me without pause. Pinging me whenever he could. I also don't know how he could type so much. I could hardly respond back to him, because i was busy trying not to die again. Heimer was the type of guy who calls you \"kid\", like he was a grown man playing League.
