In the past,it showed that rioters where more likely to respond to toxic comments than cival ones,because they knew people were pissed off and frustrated. Getting rid of toxic comments entirely is not necessary,as long as the rioters don't have a mental breakdown just from reading them.","replies":[{"poster":"Academy Kayn","date":"2018-07-25T00:09:19.543+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Toxic comments are needed sometimes in case they won't listen\n\n\"Man, these guys won't listen.

It isn't. And people are different from each other. What one person can deal with is what another might not.
