The early and overall jungle clear on sol even when done well is trash tier.( idk about adding the monster buffs to drags and barons, prob not good).  or atleast make it so that his jungle clear can be up to par. Isn&#039;t diversity a big thing for this game? would be nice if more things were viable. This can scale down with level so that he doesnt become a monster at clearing mid-late game if needed. please.","replies":[{"poster":"I am Pacman","date":"2016-11-08T12:28:29.196+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"How about we wait until we see how the jungle changes shake things up first?","replies":[{"poster":"why so bad tho","date":"2016-11-08T12:33:33.129+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"the krugs. and chickens. nuff said.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GROUP OR FEED","date":"2016-11-08T13:08:03.835+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Whoa that actually seem's like a viable and balanced way to make sol jungle viable.
