I actually AGREE that Zed is in a bad spot right now and does need some changes.  But I would like to share my thoughts on Zed. \r\n\r\n**A quick preface**\r\nI have been a Zed player since mid season 3.  He quickly became my favorite champion, and I played him through ALL metas.  When he was strong or weak or OP, or whatever.  Changing Zed will not change my desire to play him, and playing him through all the changes in the game since mid season 3 has given me a pretty objective perspective on him and his strengths/weaknesses.\r\n\r\n**Can Zed's kit be balanced?**\r\nA lot of people have short memories.  Early to mid season 4, this game was considerably different.  At that time, Lulu, Soraka and Ori were the dominant mid laners and the meta called for support style mids to support the strong bruiser/carry style junglers and and AD carries.  At this time, Zed was not considered OP, in fact, anytime someone would complain about Zed on the forums they were usually down-voted into obscurity.  Alas, the meta has changed -- assassins are on the rise again, and Zed has taken the forefront.  \r\n\r\nI have read a ton of threads in the past month that have said that \"Zed can simply not be balanced...  His kit is just way to strong.\"  And I think that it only takes looking back 3 short months to see a time when he was considered a bad pick in both competitive play and solo-que.  So a massive overhaul is not what Zed needs, he doesn't need a rework and he doesn't need a changed ultimate.  His balancing issue is strictly a numbers problem.  \r\n\r\n**Why so OP all of a sudden**\r\nHis buffs this summer were not the reason for him being considered OP right now.  The meta has just happened to shift back to him being in a dominant position.  I mean, think about it, the mids rising to popularity right now are all similar to Zed (assassins with good lanning-phases and roam potential).  This is due mostly to the changes in the jungle, discouraging, or at least evening out, early game pressure.  \r\n\r\nOnce Zed is nerfed, which is probably inevitable at this point, he will no longer be over-shadowing the major problems with EVERY assassin, not just Zed.  And pretty much every popular assassin right now has the same issues.  So if we are going to put Zed under a microscope and talk about his strengths, we should probably do the same with other assassins that have similar kits.\r\n\r\n**The other strong assassins**\r\n{{champion:105}} \r\nI think that if we are going to talk about Zed not having the \"risk vs reward\" play style that assassins are suppose to have, then Fizz should be right there next to him.  Every problem concerning Zed right now can be applied to Fizz with the exception of being manaless.\r\n\r\n{{champion:7}} \r\nWith the changes to her W, she is once again strong, and will surely make a come back.  Plenty of wave clear, and a very safe playstyle with considerable burst.\r\n\r\n{{champion:55}} \r\nShe was just recently nerfed, but still the same issues.  Including being manaless.\r\n\r\n{{champion:84}} \r\nNot the same wave clear as the champs above but enough damage to easily put Zed to shame while having a crazy safe play style and no mana.\r\n\r\n{{champion:103}} \r\nAhri is in a weird spot, really strong but very  under-played.  I expect she will make an excellent come back.  But maybe not necessary on this list.\r\n\r\nAll these champs have glaring issues with the meta right now, and any one of them could be in Zed's spot easily.  I think as a community we need to examine the role in general, not just Zed.\r\n\r\n**What Zed needs**\r\nI think Zed is in need of some nerfs, and here are my thoughts.  First, death mark cooldown at levels 1 and 2, should be higher.  It is up to often in the lanning phase for mages to have opportunities for counter play. Next, his W should have a significantly longer cooldown, but the cooldown reduction from his E should be applied only on Zed's E not his shadow, and be much higher.  This means that Zed still has sticking potential, but not as much safety, poke in lane without taking risks.  Finally his Q damage should be slightly reduced at early levels.  \r\n\r\ntl;dr\r\nZed needs changes, but every assassin does, let's not go crazy here with all the Zed hate, he CAN be balanced.","replies":[{"poster":"blujadajhdja","date":"2015-01-10T03:02:53.188+0000","up_votes":32,"down_votes":1,"body":"Wow, this is actually pretty un-biased, especially for a Zed main. +1, all the other threads on this topic are way overexaggerated.

Take Master Yi for example: He is considered a n00b champion and is very easy to get the hang of. However, really skillful players can make use of a ton of things in his kit, like dodging skill shots and negating enemy burst, which is why he sees play in high elo soloque.\n Zed to me is a pretty high skill floor for an assassin, but once you get the basics, he is easy just like most other assassins. I'd say probably the most complicated assassins I can think of are Rengar and Shaco. Both have a ton of skill and/or combos required to achieve standard damage compared to most other assassins. They aren't the highest skill cap, but very high skill floor champs. I'd say highest skill cap is probably Zed. And that is part of what makes him so strong, you can get good at Zed, but you have a lot more room to do cool things with him than with a lot of champs.","replies":[{"poster":"lDontLiftIcarry","date":"2015-01-10T04:17:32.745+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"shaco is one of the highest skill caps in the game.\n\nHave you seen riots Ai?\nImagine ttrying to get one of thier beginner bots to fight for you.\nThats how difficult shacos clone is to make useful.","replies":[{"poster":"junglerboy16","date":"2015-01-10T12:40:52.438+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, that is high skill *floor*.

As it stands, Death Mark has a 120 second cooldown rank 1, that with brutalizer and masteries drops to 102 seconds. Roughly a minute 1:45, and thats not a lot of time to pressure him, considering if he kills you the respawn timer is 20 seconds at lvl 6. If it takes another 20 seconds to reach lane against, you have 1 minute before his ulti is back up. This is made worse by how safe Zed can play in that minute.","replies":[{"poster":"Junkο","date":"2015-01-10T16:48:18.849+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"To be fair his ult CD is higher than the ult of every other mid lane assassin.\n\nTalon has 75, also buys CDR\nLB has 40, also buys CDR\nKatarina 90 CD, maybe buys CDR+reset passive\n\nAnd all 3 can snowball harder than Zed (though LB falls off hard if the game isn't finished quickly)","replies":[{"poster":"B4ckslash","date":"2015-01-10T17:28:00.018+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Talon will fall short in any kind of fight nowadays, even vs a squishy caster....

Zed can then just keep pushing until they run out of mana, then either kill them or go roaming freely.\n\nThen there's the other side of that. Let us assume that you are able to perfectly dodge all of Zed's poke, and do not feel the need to buy armor, so you can get mana regen instead. Mana regen has recently been nerfed, to the point where you are almost guaranteed to run out of mana just trying to stop Zed from taking your turret by pushing. Buying regen helps, but it's not enough for most mages to keep up with clearing wave after wave of minions.\n\nAnd even pushed up to your turret, ganking Zed is nearly useless anyway if he's halfway decent at warding with his trinket. He can just ward one side and avoid the other, and his W will make for an easy escape 90% of the time, no matter how far he pushed.","replies":[{"poster":"Epilogue of Life","date":"2015-01-10T23:16:02.201+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If the mage builds armor, then Zed can't kill that mage unless he or she let Zed ult them out of tower with about 1/2 health. Also, blue buff exists for a reason, get that to help with the mana problems. And, about the jungler gank--if Zed uses his W to stay alive, he can't use it to poke you. A good jg pressure will make the Zed hesitate about throwing out his W offensively, and life is SO much easier when the Zed just Q's to poke. Zed's a strong laner, because late game he can't compete with champions like Vayne and Ori, so beating him in lane is supposed to take more than beating a Kassadin in lane.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"CaptnJakSparrow","date":"2015-01-11T03:19:16.277+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIBR4zudWpo    \n\nTo be frank. Zed is quite overwhelming in lane. He punishes poor farmers, but at the same time holds his own against dedicated pushers while applying the burst potential of poor farmers. Only, he also guarantees his jungler blue buff + experience just for picking him. People often forget that's actually a pretty big deal.  Especially considering he get his own just by simply killing the enemy mid. And if he fails? Doesn't really matter anyways. High reward, low risk. \n\n\nThe other problem, he's arguably as slippery as Lee, only also untargetable at times, and has the potential to travel over  8,000 spaces via his W and R. Yes, Leblanc can do that too. But, the difference between him and Leblanc, is Leblanc can't auto attack you to death, nor does she leave homies that can also attack people chasing him. She also doesn't build boots of mobility. \n\nHis tower diving is also quite out of hand. He pidgeonholes anyone without an untargetable ability to immediately rush a zhonyas, or prepare to die.  That's actually a pretty big dps loss for most mages that are now so nerfed they require deathfires to reach the same burst as Zed.  So, by simply picking him you are indirectly saving your team from becoming roaming death fire killed. \n\nIT's actually risky to pick any assassin champ besides Fizz against him. You're better off with a more tanky/supporty mid. \n\n\nWhat exactly is the downside of picking Zed? Honestly, there really isn't. And what few downsides there are are easily remedied by an ap jungler, or top which isn't too uncommon to begin with. Other than that, the only real downside is there will be more zhonyas on the enemy team. But, by switching your ult to the adc, the issue is remedied anyways.\n\nTl;dr if you're good with Zed, there really is no reason NOT to pick him. That's kind of an issue.","replies":[{"poster":"D1rtFarmer","date":"2015-01-11T16:05:04.171+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You've said it best by far!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Decaedeus","date":"2015-01-10T22:33:58.215+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think a meaningful way to hit Zed's raw power is to force him into different itemization paths besides the {{item:3153}} {{item:3142}} combo. These two items give Zed raw chasing and dueling power, while not forcing him to build raw AD items like {{champion:92}} {{champion:91}}. Right now, Zed is an assassin who can prioritize things other than AD and still burst, due to his high base damages. To this end, Zed's base damage should be toned down a notch, while his AD scaling should be increased to compensate. While not a flat nerf, it actually adds counterplay to Zed's kit (at least, I think so).

While this may bring him in line, I feel like it has the possibility of being a much harder hitting nerf than intended, but it might be needed.\n\nHowever, reducing the Death Mark duration might not be as effective as hoped. Most Zeds I have seen generally blow his load of WQE and auto a few times if possible, then leaving, which doesn't take much time. I could see this being a nerf to dueling, but not his safety, which from what I have seen is what people complain about. Maybe make it so Zed can't return to his ulti shadow for X seconds? \n\nHowever, I'm not about to state I know everything about League, I am an unranked player who is somewhere between Silver and Gold judging by the people I play against. This is just my opinion, and I don't play Zed enough to gauge exactly how hard nerfs would hit him, and how to best change him.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Yoshuo","date":"2015-01-10T03:42:17.900+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"100% Agree.
