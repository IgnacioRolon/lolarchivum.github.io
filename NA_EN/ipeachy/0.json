I can click everything and when i look at my ping and fps its normal there isnt a spike. im sooo confused its been happening for the last couple nights. Ive played other games and no lag. I even restart my router every night before i play and it still happens. anyone else experiencing this?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-16T20:40:05.243+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This kind of input delay is usually due to a network issue, and it's strange that it's happening at a specific time every night.  This could either be some kind of background processes your PC is working on at that time, or possibly a change in your ISP's routing during that period.  Do you have any antivirus downloads or maintenance happening during this time that could be taking bandwidth?  I suggest going over our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to help tune up your connection and make sure your settings are ok!

Ill put it to the test. I do not have any maintenance going on; I normally do all my maintenance checks in the mornings before I even start to play anything. Alrighty i'll see to that connection issues page. Thanks i'll let you know!","replies":[]}]}]}
