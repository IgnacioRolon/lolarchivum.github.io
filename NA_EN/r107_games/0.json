Self harm is a common term used for destructive actions taken by a person with a mental disorder or in a destructive place.   The word choice is awkward because when taken out of context it can be applied to anything but I seriously doubt itâ€™s meant to be taken that way (unless theyâ€™d consider it a euphemism. I vaguely think Iâ€™ve heard of someone get banned for the phrase kiss yourself for example?).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tahminatrix ","date":"2018-12-04T04:11:34.857+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Go duel a 10/0 yasuo.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Snarf of thunder","date":"2018-12-04T03:45:24.713+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Go step on a melted chocolate peice","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-12-04T02:14:16.519+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is actually a pretty good question.

(it pisses me off that I'm afraid to even type the damn phrase out...) \"to discontinue existing\" is against the rules. Therefore, I would assume telling someone to cause themselves lethal and/or serious harm would be against the rules. And seeing how... \"amazing\" RIOT is, I would assume they'd say something like this:\n\n\"League of Legends has the greatest community with no trolls whatsoever. We hold to the highest code of conduct in the highest order! We believe nobody should say anything negative, at anytime, for any reason. Happy happy happy\"! it's at this point they'd tell us to take our joy (video game reference).\n\nWith that said: I still see plenty of troll say the same things. Only they put it much more elegantly, and are still happily playing league after reports. So.. you know. Yay justice.","replies":[]}]}
