His usage at higher levels of play attests to that.\n\nGod forbid that Kassadin might need to think about what he's doing instead of just ulting in, delivering a combo, surviving with his tanky stats and maybe using zhonyas if things get really bad and then ulting out.","replies":[{"poster":"Kobila2000","date":"2015-02-18T23:44:07.226+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Yes, I always wonder in which case would you absolutely need to flash more than 3 times, since apparently having any kind of mana limitation counts as a huge flaw, no matter how insignificant it really is in practice.\nAnd don't forget \"bad early\".
