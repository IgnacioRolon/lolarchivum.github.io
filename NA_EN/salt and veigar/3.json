She is very squishy early game so this helps her more than hurts her. The only change that is a rather sizeable nerf is the mana regen nerfs although this is probably to stop her from mindlessly spamming. I assume that if this change hurts her to much they will increase the effects of a spell or two or just change it back but mindless spamming is rather dull in lane. Plus they are buffing her mana regen per level so she will be able to cast more as the game goes on. She already will have greater mana regen by level 8.

That's just stupid, considering that her strong early game poke was countered by the fact that she was one of the squishiest champs in the game.  They're essentially trying to completely change her playstyle, for no stated reason other than \"clarity\".

More or less forcing Sona to play more passive and smart as a mage who looks for good trades while she outranges/pokes/sustains her lane opponents.\n\nI say this because @ level 4 Sona will effectively be at less total health than pre-tweak, however changes to her mana regen also mean that during the time she has more health post-tweak(levels 1-3) she instead has less mana regen meaning bad trades will hurt more during this time, but after this point she will have more mana regen allowing her to go for more good trades that she previously couldn't take advantage of because she ran the risk of going OOM.\n\nIn assessment, this is Riot's way of rewarding better Sona players who know how to trade effectively and punishing those who aren't positioning and trading to Sona's fullest potential","replies":[]},{"poster":"kunkudunk","date":"2015-02-01T08:12:15.324+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://www.surrenderat20.net/p/current-pbe-balance-changes.html\nHere you go, you will have to scroll down a bit.
