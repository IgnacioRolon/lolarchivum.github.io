At the champ select screen, my game weirds out and I get greeted with a \"reconnect\" button.\nI click it.\nNothing happens.\nI click it again.\nNothing happens (etc etc.)\nAfter spending about 10 minutes looking up a solution, I notice my client has a new message for me.\n\"You have left a game. Leaving ruins games (something to that effect, don't remember exactly what it said), and we want to understand you won't leave in the future. Type \"I Agree\" below to confirm that you agree.\"\nWHAT?\nI didn't leave, my client just glitched out and the reconnect button didn't work! The only way I could even continue is to type \"I Agree\" and I didn't even leave, so why do I get some sort of punishment for that? (also why is leaving bot games even punishable?)\n\nDo you guys have any feedback?\n\nEDIT: This happened AGAIN after I posted this. Does anybody have a fix?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-29T04:37:14.872+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It pretty much sounds like your client had a strong enough connection with the servers at first to get you into a match (since you mentioned being on the champ select screen), but then your connection might have gone dormant for some weird reason and couldn't get another solid link. First, I'd check to see if your firewalls or antivirus might have caused your connection to timeout by going through and setting up exceptions for League following the steps in the [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) for firewalls.","replies":[{"poster":"Raymond Amantius","date":"2017-12-29T16:49:25.345+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, because this was only in bot matches.
