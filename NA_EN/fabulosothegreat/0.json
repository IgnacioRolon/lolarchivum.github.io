It may not immediately seem like you're the one at fault here, but it'd be important to remember that this type of abuse negatively affects the experience of other players.\n\nBecause they're not the ones to suffer any instant consequence, boosting services are likely to use cheats for convenience.  We've made significant efforts to detect this scripting behavior, and as a general rule, I'd recommend not [sharing your account](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751664-Protecting-Your-Account#h2q1) for any reason.  \n\nGold V definitely isn't worth it.","replies":[{"poster":"Decrit","date":"2016-01-15T09:33:40.465+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"wait\n\nyou forgot this\n\n{{summoner:11}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"shyv","date":"2016-01-15T06:26:27.300+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=mirageofpenguins,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=oo9XnJvf,comment-id=0007,timestamp=2016-01-15T06:12:39.496+0000)\n\n> Gold V definitely isn't worth it.\n\nl m a o","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sythriel Draken","date":"2016-01-15T06:28:10.740+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":24,"body":"So do you losers use that excuse for everyone now?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"PIMPSMOOTH","date":"2016-01-14T23:27:23.096+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"The last kid who was calling down the thunder on Riot banning them for this swore up and down he didn't script or use 3rd party software, and when a red posted in response it turned out the kid was right: \n\nHe was banned for getting boosted and they had the exact number of games he boosted too LMFAO!","replies":[{"poster":"FABULOSOTheGREAT","date":"2016-01-14T23:33:41.581+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"Even if he was banned for boosting I had friends banned for 2 weeks for that not forever.","replies":[{"poster":"Pixiehorse","date":"2016-01-14T23:50:36.716+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"The boosters will use 3rd party apps 90% of the time.
