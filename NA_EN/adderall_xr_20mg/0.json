Once minions spawn everything starts rubber banding while my ping and fps are fine. I can play aram , but certain champs cause this lag, like MF ult and illaoi ult. My connection is currently being throttled to 128kpbs, is this the problem? Is there something I can do?

I ran the log reader, my results\n\naverage ping: 88, highest 142 (no problems here) packet loss 2.54%.\n\nI'm assuming it's cause my data is throttled to 128kbps.

I started to do the repair on the client but canceled part way through. I tried to do the Log Reader but I think it wanted to check my recent games, all my recent ones were at my friends house. So I started up a game, I turned shadows off, disabled eye candy and turned sound off. Game ran smooth, running my 2nd test game now.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-23T17:59:28.643+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like your network is suffering from some packet loss and causing the rubber band or delay that you're seeing.
