I originally submitted a bug regarding crashing errors before I was place in low priority. \r\n\r\nDoes the Arma 5v5 count toward low priority to get out of it? \r\n\r\nAny help would be appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-14T03:56:06.251+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Aram's should be counting towards LPQ's as long as you're in them from start to finish without being marked as afk!","replies":[{"poster":"CajunWafflez","date":"2017-12-14T17:54:53.926+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am in it from start to finish. I've completed like 4 of them and I'm still in Low Priority waiting 20minutes each time.\n\nI think this is slightly over kill. I reported a bug as to why my game was crashing. How many more 20 minute penalties do have to sit through?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-15T02:10:42.158+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahhhh so you were just confused as to how many LPQ games you had left is all. Anytime you get an LPQ, it's there for a certain amount of games. It actually looks like you've already finished all of them up by now.\n\n\nPS We read through all of these, of course. You just happened to respond while I wasn't at work.
