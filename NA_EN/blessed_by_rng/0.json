He has what players would call an \"Overloaded kit\". Pyke users wouldn't be so ballsy if they knew they couldn't gain almost all that lost HP back in matter of seconds.\nHell from what I seen, having a Tank Support doesn't even work well against Pyke as compared to other pull champs. Usually hooking a tank is one thing a pull champ worries about...not Pyke though.\n\n\nBut yeah thats how I feel about him...the biggest gripe is everything centers around him being able to heal almost everything lost so he can get away with making lots of mistakes and making high risk plays with little to no actual risk! Kench's concept on recent lost health being a shield is a better idea then just giving all that HP back.\n\nSide Note: WHY is all champions that can go stealth/invisible getting \"SPEED Increases\"...The idea of those is to move around slowly to not be spotted...not somehow move around faster.","replies":[]},{"poster":"saphireflame123","date":"2019-08-02T22:29:12.553+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":10,"body":"Why?
