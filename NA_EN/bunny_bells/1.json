This did not help.  I found an issue similar to this posted many years ago.  I know Rito likes to say \"Soon\", but I feel like this is an oversight that could have been addressed.  The work around you provided also has another problem.  The game won't capture my mouse in this mode and ends up going over into my other monitors, making the game absolutely unplayable.\n\nIf you have any other suggestions though, I'm all ears.\n\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Jibbur,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=sWYHl2GX,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-11-11T04:27:07.261+0000)\n>\n> this is a pretty sad work around, unfortunately I have to play on my 4k monitor with league at 1080p, just so i can find my mouse and click the correct person.

All the particles and everything look great in 4k.  I'm more willing to try and learn how to play with a small pointer on 4k than deal with the wonky scaling from 1080p.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-13T21:40:04.288+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"That usually resolves it for most players @ 4k.

I also noticed that 2k mouse cursor is tinier than 4k. I have been using a 1080 tv as a monitor since 2009 recently got a 4k for sale and now if I cant fix this, League will no longer be playable for me.\n\nAlso I hope league gets on this soon. 4k TVs are becoming the norm as they are as low as 300 on sales now. Got an LG 4k 2017 model for 350 with this superbowl sale.\n\n\nP.S. Adapting is nearly impossible when your in a teamfight you loose sight of your mouse completely. \n\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"KwiKz","date":"2017-12-15T03:21:25.332+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"when is there going to be a fix for this issue?

That isn't even a terribly hard thing to implement in a game so it is really odd to not be implemented.   Also a higher contrast colorblind mode cursor that _really_ stands out would be great considering how many yellow impacts and sparkles are around.\n\nHell... as a standard nasus makes it pretty easy to hide your tiny cursor on yourself....","replies":[]},{"poster":"AbdullahTron","date":"2018-03-08T15:21:40.391+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Found a solution.
