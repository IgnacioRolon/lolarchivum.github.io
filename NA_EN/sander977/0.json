However I got back into the game recently and went to go check my pbe status and it gives me an error 500. It seems that in 2014 others were having this problem but haven't seen anything recent. Any sort of feed back would help.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-15T23:54:06.954+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The PBE Page Error 500 usually indicates that there's something up with your ability to reach that page through standard network routing.
