In additional, my character has become a blur.  You can barely see the character you are playing and it feels like it's skipping frames.  This only occurs when you **MOVE**, standing still does not trigger this.  In game, this seems to only effect me, not the other players, unless they come in contact with me, but once they leave my circle their character and gauge return to normal.  This occurs in all game modes, beginning to end.  I've already re-installed and repaired, yet nothing seems to help.  Please, can someone help?  (If there is a sitcky/post about this already, then forgive me because I couldn't find such topic)","replies":[{"poster":"TheTruePlagueRat","date":"2016-11-24T03:54:53.939+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm having the same issue right now. I don't have Movement Prediction on and it's still happening for some weird reason. It gets worse the more I move and it becomes uncomfortable on the eyes after a short bit.\n\nEDIT: I turned off Anti-Aliasing and Wait for Vertical Sync and it calmed the jittering down greatly. It still does it but not on the scale it did before. It's almost non existent.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Charge Shot","date":"2016-12-13T00:49:15.790+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay!  So I found something that _might_ have something to do with it.  It's the resolution.  It's never been a problem before, but minimizing it and changing it to borderless/windowed gets rid of the problem.  It could be because of something else, but this worked for me, at least so far.  However, my laptop's max resolution is 1366x768 and I do not like playing at a resolution any smaller than that.  Personally saying, my screen is already small enough and I don't wanna make it smaller.  I don't know what is triggering this, but please fix it if it is something in your abilities. The \"Hextech Tool\" program you provided in your comment was helpful, but didn't solve anything at the very least.
