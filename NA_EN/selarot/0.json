The account that I transferred has the same username as a native LAN account I also owned, and thus anytime I try to log into my (previously) NA account, it instead tries to log me into my LAN account. My account has effectively disappeared and can no longer log into it, neither on client, nor on the league website. \r\n\r\nI tried sending a ticket to support, but so far the only response I've gotten was from the LAN Blitz Bot giving me a useless password reset for my LAN account.

I don't have any details to look into this for you, but if you've submitted a ticket then it will be escalated to the account team.  They'll be able to help discover where your account is currently sitting at.

I transferred the one from NA to LAN, and since they share usernames I'm unable to log into the recently transferred one.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-26T16:58:45.302+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In that case, if the username already existed then you would have been prompted to create a new one.

I have two tickets:\n(#23896440) - LAN ticket, where the Blitz Bot replied and gave me password reset on the LAN account, which was irrelevant to what the ticket asked.\n(#23879525) - NA ticket, which merely told me to wait.\n\nAlso, due to being unable to access said account, and the nature of recover-account tickets (which make you submit them logged off) I cannot even check the progress of the ticket on the Riot Support website.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-26T17:12:01.922+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the information!  The username is different than what you're attempting, but unfortunately I can't provide any information here through a public venue.  Our account team will need to help out with letting you know the username you had, and will need to verify ownership before providing it.  In the meantime, see if the following[ username recovery guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751724-Recovering-Your-Username) might be able to help.  Otherwise, hang tight until they are able to reach out to you.\n\n(My initial response about usernames still stands, if you ever return to a region you've already been to once)","replies":[{"poster":"Selarot","date":"2016-10-26T17:37:55.884+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How could it possibly be a different username when I have been logging in for years as that one?
