It's still in testing and the I Agree window there is fairly new.  If you're still having issues, try the legacy version to type I Agree.\n\n-  On the login screen of the open beta updated client, look for the \"Launch Legacy Client\" text at the bottom.\n-  Or create a shortcut directly to the legacy client in your League Installation. Just look for \"lol.launcher\" \n\nLet me know if that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"Bepuzzle","date":"2017-03-07T21:57:07.357+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"l tried League client;lol.laucher.admin and lol.launcher already, none of them works.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-07T21:58:32.131+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can you grab me a screenshot of what you're seeing?","replies":[{"poster":"Bepuzzle","date":"2017-03-07T22:30:54.915+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"l dont know how to post screenshot.... l am updating 7.5patch now.
