Bought lots of skins, champs. It was great adventure. But sometimes u can get bored from playing one game. I made a break from League Of Legends in last days of December and didn&#039;t really bother checking the account. I came back to league, tried to log in and saw:\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/bHJc9Oq.png\r\n\r\nI was like: &quot;Wait what...? It must be some kind of mistake&quot;. I logged into my support and saw this:\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/dPAEeP9.png\r\n Translation to English:\r\n&quot;Someone is hijacking my account and i want to change password but to do that i need old email&quot;\r\nHe then writes that he lost access to his email 4 years ago (It&#039;s not true, the real owner has it even now) and wants to convince support that he is the real account owner by telling about champ and skin refunds (it&#039;s not like he could see it in history). He then says about account creating location, which is untrue. Unlucky for him support isn&#039;t so eager to let him change the e-mail and sends him to the other page.\r\n\r\nHe got access to my account probably because of Brute Force method, because none of my other accounts (for ex. facebook or email) were stolen and I had the same login and summoner name. He played few games, mainly rankeds (lost a lot of them). I think he just couldn&#039;t get this account for himself so he thought &quot;if i can&#039;t, nobody will&quot; and used scripts to get my account banned. \r\n\r\nAfter I realised what happened I wrote to support about my acc being compromised. I got answer that my account was disabled because of using scripts, exploits or other third-party programmes. I wrote to support once again with clarification that I wasn&#039;t the one who used them. Their answer was negative.x Had I known, I would have changed my summoner name or used even harder password, so they wouldn&#039;t get it so easy.\r\n\r\nWhen I was checking the boards I saw topic about some scripters being unbanned... It was sad for me considering the fact they said they won&#039;t be able to help me...\r\n\r\nI know there is almost no chance to get my account back, but if there&#039;s any Rioter who reads this, i&#039;ve got two questions and a request.\r\n\r\nFirst of all... Is it possible to know when were the scripts used on my account, so I could be 100% sure when was it done? I didn&#039;t get email notification and found out about ban when logging to my acc.\r\n\r\nSecond is: Is there anything I could do in this situation or  is it just lost forever?\r\n\r\nThird is: Could u please implement some kind of authorisation feature? Many different sites or programmes are using it and it helps a lot. I&#039;m pretty sure if it was at that time on League, I wouldn&#039;t be here right now. It would prevent many other uncomfortable situations.\r\n\r\nThank you If you read it up to the end and thank you in advance for any kind of information.","replies":[{"poster":"Periscope","date":"2018-05-11T20:30:18.788+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Locking this post, due to its severely old age.\n\nIf you have any questions about this moderation, feel free to reach out to us in the [Boards Discord](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/community-moderation/7rtKBZLi-boards-moderation-discord-verification) or [Discuss the Boards](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/community-moderation).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Only Play Darius","date":"2017-05-14T15:25:31.661+0000","up_votes":119,"down_votes":0,"body":"Let's get this upvoted and see if we can't get your account back.

That said, it's still quite off that such a basic security measure is unavailable in a game where people spend hundreds of dollars on cosmetics.\n\nIt doesn't exactly encourage me to spend more money on it, since I don't have the peace of mind 2FA provides. Too easy to just lose it, even if my own security is fantastic. Also, the lack of security makes me a bit uncomfortable with Riot's internal level of security knowledge. It makes me wonder if all their support people know enough to prevent social engineering issues, and that's really the most viable form of hacking into accounts these days.
