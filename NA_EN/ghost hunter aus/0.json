Each game I load into I am stuck in base with attempting to reconnect/high ping issues and cant move/do anything but am able to sort of see the rest of the game go on around me.\r\nChanged my DNS server as has been suggested on other threads to the 8888 8844 etc and it worked briefly but next day isn't working again. \r\nInternet is fine - no problems in anything else etc just LOL. I have also previously played LOL on this computer without any problems.\r\n\r\nWhat are potential options to fix this?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-24T22:43:15.880+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you've got an unstable or degrading connection that's falling apart while in-game and ultimately disconnecting you.  Even though your internet is fine, you can still have problems or blocks communicating with specific servers.  Changing your DNS is a good step, but I suggest going over every step of the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to rule out possibilities and fix this up.  Let me know if you have any questions on this, and welcome back!","replies":[]}]}
