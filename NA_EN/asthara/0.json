If I just let the cursor sit and dont move it at all the frames stay at whatever I set them to (be it 200 or 60) but as soon as I move the cursor they go all over the place, saw it drop as low as 7 at one point. I really have no idea how to fix this please help.","replies":[{"poster":"Dark Morgana","date":"2017-08-27T00:03:49.316+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel as if you tried a lot of the steps in our FPS guide already, so i'm gonna get you over to the [tech team](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) to take a closer look into the situation.
