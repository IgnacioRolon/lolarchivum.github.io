Though I believe it was only made to make money who knows. The leader of this team is supposedly a master rank player. For years now people have asked why there are barely any female players in League and in professional. Well think of it this way, say a girl comes into a game with the name like ShootThemDownGirl or PuppyAnCatChick, most of the time you will get &quot;Are you a girl?&quot; &quot;Look a gamer girl&quot; &quot;How old are you?&quot; along with name calling, sexism, and many other hurtful things. By the end of it usually you get upset and the people who said those things then try to add you.  It can get tiring and just makes you want to stop playing. League is a very toxic and hateful game because of its community, if you were to go onto rank right now and play a match, you will find your team screaming, cursing, and hating on each other. So for some, they just choose to not play rank and not play League. Riot has tried over the years to calm down the toxic and hate but it still happens. If you ever want females to get into League more, we all have to calm down, start respecting each other and treat others like how you would want to be treated. If someone is being treated badly don&#039;t sit there and watch, defend them, it doesn&#039;t matter if they are on your enemy team or not, no one should be treated badly. For such a toxic community this is a big step but in the future, maybe one day, we may see kinder people and more women. This is my own thoughts and opinions, if you would like to share yours then please leave a comment and try to keep it positive. Thank you.\n~KittyLovesPoros\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[{"poster":"Beatrice falls","date":"2018-11-07T00:06:54.590+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"...

The odds of running into the same people again are extremely low, so even if someone who was toxic to you gets punished it makes no difference whatsoever. You'll still get harassed by someone else some other game when you're feeding. That's how the world is. Putting one killer in an electric chair doesn't stop all murder all around the world.","replies":[{"poster":"Silly Neeko","date":"2018-11-09T00:08:10.451+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Well, the joke is pretty much just saying that the ass is the most noticeable, just not the most useful.

I get that girls may pick a name they find \"cute\". There are names that are kind of implying you're female versus names that explicitly identify it though. Honestly - I think girls (and many guys) pick names that are explicitly female because they're used to RPGs where for whatever ridiculous reason male players will give female characters free stuff pretty often and help them out a lot. However in a game like league, that doesn't happen. There's no \"easy mode\" for female players, so there's naturally going to be less of them. \n\nIf it was really just the hate, females could just pick generic names and completely avoid the problem... (I agree it's a problem and shouldn't need to be avoided, but in the meantime why not avoid it?)","replies":[{"poster":"KittyLovesPoros","date":"2018-11-26T01:16:23.239+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not all ladies feel the need to have female in their names.
