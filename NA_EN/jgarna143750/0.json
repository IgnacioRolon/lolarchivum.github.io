I&#039;ve never seen him played with or against before. I mean, is this guy even considered a champion anymore? I know some champions are generally unpopular, like Galio or Urgot, but this is a just pitiful. He&#039;s being completely ignored by not only Riot, but by the LoL community as a whole. His share of games has been a resident in the Top 5 lowest for longer than I can remember. I&#039;m confused because when I first played Yorick, he was really fun. He seems just as good as any other champ, but yet he&#039;s so unrecognized. There have even been games where people didn&#039;t even know who Yorick was. There was new of a rework about 2 years ago but that just disappeared. All in all, I just want some answers as to what is going on with Yoric, and what we can expect in his future.","replies":[{"poster":"What Is Smite","date":"2015-06-21T02:45:03.841+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alas poor Yorick, I knew him well -Hamlet","replies":[{"poster":"DeathToHeretics","date":"2015-06-21T05:53:50.139+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fun fact, the quote is actually \"Alas, poor Yorick!

And unfortunately his redesign is no small task, ideally requiring changes to the very game engine.\n\nLiterally only a few months after he was made, the developers admitted they probably shouldn't have released him until they had new UI and controls, which would allow for his real niche, that of a multi-minion mage, a necromancer, to actually work.  Even the tanky elements were added to him, they admitted, just so he would find a role because his mage role wasn't going to be fulfilling.  And he has now been in this state for... four years I think?   It's been too long for me to even remember.  \n\nIn that time he's never been terrible because of the tanky sustain elements, and in fact had a fairly lengthy stint as a competitive top a long long time ago.  But he has no supportive skills, no ability to gank, and no way to secure a kill.  He is pretty much about nothing but survive and deny, stagnating whatever lane he is in no matter the lane opponent.  However, this strategy started to become excessively dominant in the competitive scene, and he was not only nerfed, but most fighters since have been designed or redesigned to discourage any such stagnate bunker strategy from ever making a resurgence.","replies":[{"poster":"Ariel the Cruel","date":"2015-06-21T00:40:35.751+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">ut most fighters since have been designed or redesigned to discourage any such stagnate bunker strategy from ever making a resurgence.\n\n{{champion:201}}","replies":[{"poster":"Conncept","date":"2015-06-21T14:51:44.184+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"In what imaginary world do you live in where Braum is a fighter?

If he goes to melee to proc his passive, Yorick can just drop his W on him, click on him with E, and by that point Nunu should be running already, unless he is super fed.\n\nEarly, and probably even in lane, Sion doesn't do well against Yorick. Most melee champs don't.\n\nOut of the 4 you listed, from my playing a lot of Yorick, Nasus does great against him, if he can smack the ghouls, and isn't getting hit with his W. The other 3 don't do well in lane against Yorick.\n\nThe knocking back ghouls with Sion for example isn't actually the issue. The W drops and does damage. The ghoul staying out is sort of whatever after that point. The E ghoul is more for harass, and Q, again the ghoul isn't that important as what Q does otherwise. \n\n\nI get where you are coming from, and in theory it sounds good, but doesn't work out. For example:\n\nIf nunu uses consume on the ghoul, he won't have it for a minion, and he will need it to help grab the cannon for example, cause Yorick will be harassing him down since his auto is melee.\n\nSion is good after6-9, but early levels, Yorick will bully him with his W mostly, and his E will just be annoying (I rarely early level my Q until I have to against other melee champs).\n\nMao gets bullied as well, just in general. Since Yorick does AD with Manamune and the like, but his main Spell (his W) is ap, you can't really just build defense against him in lane, cause he will go around it and just change how he attacks.\n\nNasus will make Yorick's day miserable. Not cause of q'ing his ghouls, just how he plays, and his built in sustain, and the death patch he puts down.  The other 3 aren't a problem for him in lane.","replies":[{"poster":"YumaS2Astral","date":"2015-06-22T08:54:50.192+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Before the nerfs, I used to counterpick Yorick with {{champion:84}} - She actually has sustain to survive against Yorick thanks to her passive, her E can destroy the ghouls, and her invisibility shroud can make the ghouls lose aggro.\n\nShe can also burst down Yorick after 6 with a Hextech Gunblade.\n\nOr at least she could, I am not sure how Akali would do on that matchup now.\n\nNow I like to counterpick Yorick with - believe on me or not - {{champion:90}} - Malefic visions and voidlings help in cleaning up Yorick's ghouls, which end up being free mana for Malzahar due to his E passive.

She lost a charge of mantra for a much shorter CD, her passive became reduced CD on her R rather than giving her upwards of.. 80ish AP I think based on how low of health SHE was like an AP version of Tryn's Q or Maw, and her Q went from a cone in front of her to a skill shot (Pretty fast moving at that) explosion and the Mantra Q is now boosted damage rather than healing nearby enemies.\n\nThe BIGGEST change that a lot of people hated was the loss of her Fans. If you see a Karma with the skin that shows her fans, that was her ORIGINAL art and that's how she ACTUALLY looked and she had fans to use as weapons. Her Q used to toss a bunch of fans in a cone and her AA's had her waving them around.\n\nI loved Karma pre-rework and I love her now.","replies":[{"poster":"Ariel the Cruel","date":"2015-06-21T07:48:46.062+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">The BIGGEST change that a lot of people hated was the loss of her Fans.\n\nVisually, it was the fans and the dress.\nThey went back a re-textured the fans into her classic skin's dance, and jury-rigged a dress onto her new rig.\nBut the fans were very iconic of her, and one of her strongest visual queues.

That reasoning doesnt make sense because what we WANT with a traditional skin is the previous qoutes. I LOVED old sions VO. I hate new sions VO.

He's the reason \"win lane, lose game\" is a phrase. It's not about his numbers, not really. They're okay. First, he's a melee champion with fantastic ranged harass and sustain, meaning that he can't really be strong at either.  Then, you really benefit from the tanky items and builds, making his build path confusing for newbies, as it can become very situational. Third, he does nothing for a team. At least nothing that other champions don't do as well if not better.  His lack of meaningful CC is exacerbated by his lack of mobility.\n\nHe's cool conceptually, but executed poorly by Riot. I like him, and I keep him in my pocket for those times where I have to shut down top lane no matter what, but he needs a rework. Not just a normal rework, the whole minion AI needs to be redone for him to work well.","replies":[]}]}]}
