FALSE. Games are matched so both teams have the same or similar average MMR. For easier understanding I will use simple numbers. average mmr of each team is 1000. though players in enemy team are at 1000 MMR each while you were recently on winning streak climbing hard so your MMR is higher than usual mmr for certain division. You have 2000 mmr. so to make an average mmr of your whole team 1000 you need to be matched with people of 750 MMR which is much lower than usual mmr for certain division. So those players are visibly worse than enemy team so you have to carry hard because for matchmaking both teams have same mmr so its fair. Well as you already know its not. The thing is that unlike Riot, other companies that are using this broken system can admit they are doing this and try to make the system more fair (watch blizzard's hots).

LP rank at the moment (and a lot of the time, not all) spends too much time lagging behind MMR, from things like current promos/demotion protection, and too wide of a variation between win/loss values. Moving up and down in LP rank should be LESS different than MMR ups/downs after each game. \n\nFor example in an extreme situation, if you go on a massive losing streak, you should be moving down rank significantly, and vice versa. Currently if you win a lot of games, your LP rate gets so padded that you can lose a lot yet stay close to the same division. The opposite is true if you lose a lot first, your climb in the future is so halted that it takes twice as long to move up divisions. \n\nAs a result people get stuck in certain ranks, whether it's silver 5 players taking forever to move up, or diamond  5 players taking forever to move down, and no one actually plays against people in their same division. If division rank was a closer indicator of your skill level, it would be a less frustrating and more fun/satisfying system overall.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Ben Sharpio","date":"2017-11-23T17:48:29.913+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah, and at the elo i'm in (plat1), people just duo to get past the D5 0LP players because its actually insanely hard to get pass the boosted OR boosting players as a solo player, or simply someone who doesnt play carry champs.\n\n Like, you literally have people duoing, not because they WANT to, but because it simply means you have 1 less retarded player on your team\n\nand its weird too.

I was talking about Overwatch. My understanding is that it's a small effect, as it should be, but does certainly matter and at least somewhat work from what I can tell.\n\nIn team games I feel it's an absolute necessity. Without it luck is far more important than skill as to whether or not you go up or down in rank within a certain range, the edges of which are a bit far apart (like more than an entire division typically) and where your skill (or lack thereof) eventually is different enough to overcome the fact that you're just 1 person on a team of 5 (or 6, or whatever depending on the game/mode).","replies":[{"poster":"ChargeItDownMid","date":"2017-11-24T03:15:04.476+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Cosnirak","date":"2017-11-24T03:41:44.975+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">Because you have been providing sources for everything you say. Why do you think riot tried so hard to create a formula that judged individual performance?\n\nSo you're just assuming.\n\nI'm 99.999% sure you're wrong because _they made an entire new system known as champion mastery to use the grading system_ and it'd be silly at best to do that _just to disguise it._ And here is where you say \"why not use it for both?\" And I say \"technically possible, extremely unlikely, and ya know they _would've said something about it because they aren't evil villains trying to hide their dastardly plot.\"_\n\n>overwatch is not a moba. No serious moba does it.\n\nIt isn't about being a moba or not. All that matters in this regard is team game vs individual game. Pure MMR/ELO is a terrible way to rate individuals playing a team game. I can explain why if you want, but I feel like it's pretty obvious.\n\nAlso you don't get to decide which mobas are \"serious\" and which aren't. Also there aren't a lot of mobas. Also very few games period have ever tried individual performance affected rating systems within team competition because yeah it's complex, nuanced, a good bit of work, and inherently imperfect. It's still better and totally worth it. But just using the old standard is free, minimal effort, and there's safety in numbers (aka \"No serious moba does it\" defense).","replies":[{"poster":"ChargeItDownMid","date":"2017-11-24T04:11:46.315+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Cosnirak","date":"2017-11-24T05:12:25.534+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">They weren't disguising it at all. They straight up said the grading was made to reflect individual contribution to team performance. Originally, it even broke down exactly what percentage of the mastery points your own contribution accounted for.\n\nGonna need some major proof here. I'll wait.\n\n>Actually, it is very important because of what is and what is not possible in a moba vs in another game. What you are proposing is straight up impossible to do in a moba. You have to stop living in your own fantasy world. There is no magic formula which can calculate individual contribution well enough to be a better rating system than mmr.\n\nIt's impossible to do it _perfectly_ either way for _any_ type of game. Even in a 1v1 game ELO is not a _perfect_ system. That isn't the point. Incorporating some amount of individual performance metric to simply influence the degree you gain and lose rating would be an easy improvement even if only halfway decently done. MMR systems are simply that awful at rating individuals in team settings. Most people are just so used to it that like you they accept it as somehow ok. It isn't ok. It's wildly bad.\n\n>I never decided, I played all of them.\n\nIt doesn't matter if you played them or not. You alone do not get to decree which are serious or not. No one person does. Even popularity alone doesn't decide that. _Nothing_ decides that for everyone. Each person decides how _they_ feel about it and that's it. It's fine for _you_ to not think it's \"serious.\" It's not fine for you to tell _me_ that it isn't \"serious.\" And for the record, I actually agree with you about hots. It just doesn't matter in this discussion anyways.\n\n>Also, league already tried individual performance and failed.\n\nNeither of those things is true as far as I've seen. Certainly not if you're talking about champion mastery. Yes it's clearly flawed in a number of ways, but I wouldn't call it a failure at all. I think if Riot decided to use it to affect MMR they'd take it a little more seriously, tune it, get feedback on it, and keep tuning it over time. They simply haven't decided to do that and I doubt they will any time soon sadly.","replies":[{"poster":"ChargeItDownMid","date":"2017-11-24T05:46:43.358+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Cosnirak","date":"2017-11-24T06:04:30.573+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">They say it straight up in the support section:\nRiot never hid the fact that the grading system was a way for them to attempt at measuring your own performance.\n\nYou're completely right in regards to it literally being that. But I assumed we were still talking about it in the context of it having anything to do with MMR. What they said has nothing to do with MMR. You haven't remotely proven that they ever intended to use it to affect MMR (or even LP) in _any way, shape, or form._ When you have proof that they did, come share it.\n\n>This has never been the case in a moba.\n\nNo direct bearing on if it _could_ become the case. It's only related in the sense that change is hard, making something new takes effort, people will be scared of change, blah blah all that typical stuff. Nothing is inherently wrong with doing it.\n\n>Individual performance metrics are simply too hard to evaluate well\n\nI strongly disagree and I don't think either of us can convince the other on this issue. But regardless, that's not even terribly relevant. What matters more is that current MMR systems are _so stupendously terrible for team games that even a bad individual performance system slightly influencing one is an upgrade._\n\n>Riot took it very seriously and tried to tune the mastery system for over a year without much success.\n\nAccording to who? I certainly didn't see that from Riot. They certainly didn't sound like they were fine tuning it after the first month. Where are you even remotely getting this idea from?\n\n>Dota inhouse league have been trying for many years abeit on a smaller scale without any success.\n\nI have zero knowledge about such a thing. But based on how you see League's champion mastery system and your out of nowhere assumption about Riot's intentions for it I honestly have no faith in your assessment of the situation so... *shrug*","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Escheton","date":"2017-11-23T17:52:36.643+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you win a lot your mmr rises a lot.
