Steraks is an amazing item and again ROA doesn't really work on too many champions. Steraks give your HP plus Base damage increase while providing a great passive that helps eat any burst damage.

Should all 10 players in the map deserves to build 10 GA despite different various team comp?

For Example name 1 dedicated AP Assassin Item, now go ahead and name AD assassin Items Duskblade, Youmuus's, and edge of night come to mind even if the last one isnt great. and then AD assassins have choices Maw, GA, Deaths Dance, and so on for some defensive items. Right now the only decent defensive items for AP mages and assassins is Zhonya's and Banshees (which is built far less). AD items have better choices AP items suck with Variety. AD assasins can easily get 40% cd from 3 strong items BC, Dusk, and youmu's all work great together which you cant even compare a single item on the AP side like black cleaver is on the AD side.

First you are just wrong plenty of AD champs rely on their kits especially AD assassins. Wukong, Zed, Talon just for example heavily rely on their kits just as much as AP champs so we will consider them AD casters.  Second there are different types of AP user not just mages like you seem to assume. They want an AP fighter (Diana) but the only kind of AP fighter Item the have is ROA and maybe Rylais which fine whatever but they need an AP % shred like Black Cleaver. AP assassins are sharing the same items as Mages which is dumb because you don't have AD casters/fighters and Markman (usually excluding MF and Lucian building Black cleaver) building the same thing. They need different Items they need different passives. There are so many different types of AP users yet they are all stuck with the shitty AP items that are basically just stat boosts BIG EXAMPLE Rabadons which I would take an item that has a better passive like the Black Cleaver passive, but for an AP user.","replies":[{"poster":"boricCentaur1","date":"2018-10-26T03:02:42.628+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I used black cleaver as a example to why  you can't have items like that for ap.

You said that there are different types of ap champions but you did not say how like yeah there all different types of ap but that only means how the champion is played a ap assasin will most likely have the sames needs as a burst mage.
