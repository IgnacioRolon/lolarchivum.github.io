If your brother needs himself with this account, he can reach out to us directly to a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new), and we'd be happy to help.  Account security is something we take pretty seriously, so we won't be able to help without certainty that we're corresponding with the owner.  Hope that helps clear things up.","replies":[]}]}
