However, I've been experiencing an interesting bug where my keybinds just don't work, starting at the beginning of the game. \r\n\r\nI load into the game, just like any other game. I will pick my first spell, run out to lane, leash, etc.\r\n\r\nOnce I begin the laning phase, I will attempt to harass, poke, etc. with said spell. However, the spell never triggers.\r\n\r\nNormally I will wait a level or 2 to see if any of my keybinds will work for any spell, and it just doesn't happen. Flash, ignite, items, etc. do not work either.\r\n\r\nHere's the kicker: all of my spells will work if I hit the windows button+ the designated key for the spell (ie, windows+Q will let me actually fire my Q spell). \r\n\r\nI'm not a huge fan of maneuvering my hands all wonky to use 1 spell, as it feels a lot more fluid using 1 key compared to 2. \r\n\r\nThe only fix I have found so far is to leave the game and re-log into the client.\r\n\r\nIt seems to be fairly random; I haven't really seen any set pattern as far as when it occurs; I just can't use spells sometimes, and other times it works just fine.\r\n\r\nI don't have any issues once the keybinds are working; they will NOT just randomly stop working. They either work from beginning to end or don't. \r\n\r\nThanks for reading, I hope to gain some insight and possibly some prevention or fixes to this issue, as my computer is a little slow and those few minutes spent logging are very precious in this game!","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-26T02:26:13.974+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yikes that's no good.

I haven't quite tried this yet since reading, but what seems to be working at the moment is running the client as administrator. I'll update if this stops working!","replies":[]}]}]}
