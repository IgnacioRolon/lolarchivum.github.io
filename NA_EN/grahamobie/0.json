First time my account has ever got reported or banned or anything. 14 days. Out of no where. My friends on my own team who had about 4x more message than me didn&#039;t even get banned or reported. Most of the messages it said were bad were to my own team anyway say like &quot;these guys suck&quot; you know that kind of thing. I don&#039;t understand why I got this massive ban and now it says I might get the Perma, so I guess I just wont communicate so that I cant get banned. I&#039;m just baffled that I was the only one banned and that it was 14 days. Now I want to go report them (I don&#039;t ever report people cause I&#039;m not a ()  ) but I cant because my account is suspended.  I mean they were saying the same thing to me. I just did not ban them right as the game ended. I know that there is probably nothing that can be don but ... And it says that I&#039;m on of the .2 % to get banned. Like, no I&#039;m on of the .2% to get in a game with a bunch of babies. Its just a game you don&#039;t have to report me. I don&#039;t really care at this point I don&#039;t really even play that much anyway. If anyone want to play some WOrld of WarShips while I&#039;m banned add me a Grahamobie. (good game, highly recommend)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings I said to the other team\n\neat my dick and gargle my nutz\nur a bunch of easy bitches\nlil pussies\nall of ya\nFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUCCCCCCCCKKKKKKKKKK\nlol\nouchy]\nyou guys suck\nive never see so bad people before\nez\nlol you are taint\nOk\nfiora = shityasshole\nworth\nmal fuck you\ni swear mal ults me every time\nmal you are so fuck gay\ncause you will go to hell <- started talking about religion\n%%%got? <- =\n\nI know looking at this it looks pretty bad but you were not in the game. I chose not to report anyone because I new I was a little toxic myself and ended up with a 14 day ban. I know that people are going to be like, well you deserved the ban that's pretty bad language. Yeah pretty mean right, no. Not really. Ill probably have some ranked guy who only plays with pros say \"we never talk like that to our opponents\". we I play ARAM which is the cesspool of LoL. I enjoy talking smack. It is part of the game to me. My team was doing it and so was the other team. No one else on my team got banned except me. Not sure why. It just seems fair that the reporting system doesn't take into account the other team. I don't want to be banned, and I don't really want to ban anyone else. I don't care if people cuss in the game, they can say what ever they want. They can call me bad, I don't care its just a game. But if they do I'm going to respond. People are saying \"you didn't have to respond\" yeah I know that but its fun talking rekt to the enemies. And really have you ever played league and not had someone say \"say are terrible\" or \"get worked\" or cuss are you? I have played tons and no one ever gets banned until someone just cries because the cant take the heat. Whatever I guess I deserve the ban. I know that's what everyone is going to say anyway.\n","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Tantram","date":"2016-01-29T03:22:44.524+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"Generally, you have to be pretty bad to skip the first 2 warnings and go directly to a 14-day or perma-ban.

Escalated punishments (skipping tiers) are dealt directly by Riot after a manual review of your behavior, so it's extremely unlikely they will remove it. They only do this for extremely toxic behavior, and even then it usually takes many games of this behavior before it happens. If the other person did the same think and isn't punished yet, most likely it's because you have a history of it while they do not.\n\nI suggest posting your reform card here, and asking for one in your support ticket if you don't have one. Be aware that having been banned you are now on the edge of punishment already, so when you come off it it will be easy to trigger the next one (a permaban). You'll need to completely change your behavior if you want to avoid it; simply mute them instead of getting toxic back. It takes 3 months for your punishment tier to drop down 1 step, and if you don't know the steps they are as follows;\n\n* 10 game chat restriction\n* 25 game chat restriction\n* 14 day account ban\n* Permanent account ban\n\nThey will always go in this order except in extreme circumstances. Let me know if you have any questions, and don't forget doing a support ticket if you need help from Riot.\n\n-DTN","replies":[{"poster":"Tocosrevenge","date":"2016-01-29T03:30:59.332+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"It takes 3 months for your punishment tier to drop down 1 step\" \n\nAnyone care to confirm?^","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-01-29T03:45:44.653+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/f/mNBeEEkI/d/p7scKW1K?comment=00050000000000000000","replies":[]},{"poster":"Airbane98","date":"2016-01-29T11:21:31.646+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Tocosrevenge,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=ffZd4M01,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2016-01-29T03:30:59.332+0000)\n>\n> \"It takes 3 months for your punishment tier to drop down 1 step\" \n> \n> Anyone care to confirm?^\n\ni confirm","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Faceplow","date":"2016-01-29T06:35:52.201+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"In an ARAM? lol I play those for off meta build tests and to have fun.
