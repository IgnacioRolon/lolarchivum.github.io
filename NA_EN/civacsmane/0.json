I do not even load up into the screen and I have to keep closing my client and restarting it just to not be able to reconnect.  I have gotten 2 leavers now, this really messes me over because if I get any more leavers I'm screwed.  Is there any way that someone can help me out or whether Ill get banned for it not even being my fault in the first place.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-11T17:20:04.831+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If I understand correct, you don't have any connection issues in game or while loading.  Instead, the client doesn't even load when champion select ends.  This sounds more of a security setting problem and not a connection issue.  Something might be blocking the game from loading entirely.  I suggest using the [permissions](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) guide as your first step towards a resolution.  let me know if that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"CivacsMane","date":"2016-11-11T21:25:34.317+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello Porocles,\n\nI used the Hextech Repair Tool the first time this happened and it solved it for one game only, I allowed both league.exes through my firewall and even ran as administrator, and still doesn't allow me to reconnect sometimes.   This has been happening since yesterday never happened before, I just got placed into low priority queue this is frustrating because I just want to play the game you know and it doesn't allow me to.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-11T21:34:01.738+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for trying, even if the fix was fleeting.
