Let me be frank - it's a lot less, \"omg no muh farm I'll lose 3 minions\",  and a lot more, \"If I leave this lane for a minute to come help you I am sacrificing a level and possibility an entire wave of CS to potentially do absolutely nothing.\" I cannot stress enough that **this is a big deal**. Especially because a lot of the time there is absolutely **nothing you can do**. And then you just end up being behind, slightly tilted because you just wasted a minute of your life, and frustrated too because not only did you just waste a minute of your life, but you netted absolutely nothing out of it. \n\nAs a top lane main it is incredibly frustrating to have your ekko who died at wolves in about 2 seconds bitch at you while you sit about three screens away in your lane for not coming to help him, or when your nidalee dies at their red because of an invade gone bad, and says \"wtf gnar why didn't you sit at red with me for two minutes to make sure I didn't get my teeth knocked in by the other jungler??\" This happens more often than not, so let me get one thing straight. I'm not going to go on a useless goosechase through our jungle to avenge you, because statistics dictate that that is retarded, and if you invade I will watch for you from the safety of my lane, where I can control the enemy laner and farm. What I **will not** do is stand at their krugs for two minutes while you fuck around, just so you don't die.\n\nThis thread is honestly incredibly hypocritical and I'm surprised more people aren't speaking out. You junglers preach consistency and \"being responsible for your lane\". Okay, fine, but hey, PSA: You want to pull the whole, \"it's not my job to babysit u fam win ur lane wtf\"?

That's the honest to gods truth. Plus, if I'm pushed in, I'm sitting my ass on my lane and farming that up. I'm not missing 10 farm for a kill, nope, no way.\nNow, if my Jungler is smart, has a defensive ward down, and we spot the would be pillager from a mile away, then you better believe that I'll be preparing to push my lane out and collapse on his sorry ass.\nBut if he just suddenly pops up on my Junglers position and starts kicking his ass, I'm not about to go losing farm and flashing over walls just to superman save him or some shit.\n\nLastly, Jungler farm doesn't die to turrets or the enemy minion wave - don't try it.\nI say this as someone who mostly Jungles.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dehorn","date":"2015-12-30T14:36:02.890+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"just played against a very good nunu... the kid was ruthless. he lived in my jungle. yes i warded. yes i pinged. my teams reaction... \"man that nunu\" thats it. thats all i got. not only that, their mid and top started invading with him. what i still cant wrap my head around is that even though my team never left lane, they were even or behind the enemy.... a;lkdjf;lakdsjf;lkajds;lkadjf;ldskjf;lkadsjf;l","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jasiwel","date":"2015-12-30T15:45:18.828+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd gladly help my jungler if my opponent wasn't already handing me my sorry ass. :(","replies":[]},{"poster":"fééd l0rd","date":"2015-12-30T15:14:44.165+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"sometimes it's hard to follow because of the matchup and certain circumstances, since it is soloq. \nIf you are getting invaded you should better leave the buff (if the enemy midlaner is strong early and you got something like Cassiopeia) and don't risk anything there.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LankPants","date":"2015-12-30T14:54:27.782+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll normally move to help if a ward catches the enemy jungler before he's jumping all over mine.

It could just be a product of the matchup. The real problem is, the entire team knows there's a Lee Sin or Shaco on the enemy team, and when the jungler calls for help doing defensive warding in the river or calls for assistance at their second buff, they will frequently go unaided--leading to an invade and a kill. There's only so much one jungler can do to prevent getting jumped on, and if the laners aren't willing to help prevent the invade or provide support, the blame is also in their court for knowing its coming and letting it happen. \n\nPeople get so wrapped up in their lanes that they don't realize that it's everybody's job to protect your side of the jungle. As a laner your job may be to defend the front door to make sure the zombies don't get it, but you also have to help your jungler watch the windows because he can't have eyes on all of them all the time. That's especially true in the preseason because of the changes to warding.","replies":[{"poster":"Tails Doll","date":"2015-12-31T19:56:25.365+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you had defensive wards why didnt you see the enemy jungler coming?
