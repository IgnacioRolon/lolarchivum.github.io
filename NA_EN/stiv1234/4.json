(Warning: Long Post)","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":59,"down_votes":17,"body":"So, {{champion:245}}  is here. As we all know, he&#039;s an assassin, a mobile guy that jumps around and kills things. Not only does he have tons of damage, but also loads of utility in the form of multiple slows, a stun, an MS-buff, a huge shield, a rewind and of course mobility.\r\nNow, Ekko is not the only mobile champion in League, and that&#039;s actually not that bad of a thing. Mobility is flashy, fun for the user and creates various outplay potential. It definitely adds something into the game, but at the same time, it causes some problems, especially if it gets thrown into every new champion that comes out. \r\nLet&#039;s look at the last 15 champions: The only ones that are really immobile are {{champion:161}} and {{champion:222}}, maybe also {{champion:432}} if you dont count his E, though hes fairly mobile in terms of roaming. That&#039;s a percentage of roughly 13,3%, less than one out of six. Mobility is way more present in today&#039;s League than it was in the early days. That&#039;s the thing which is referred to as **Mobility Creep**. The most extreme example is {{champion:429}}, who was hated to hell and back for her endless jumping.\r\n\r\nThe problem with most of those champions is that they tend to overshadow the immobile ones due to not having any actual tradeoffs. Granted, most of them are melee, but they usually have higher base stats and are naturally bulkier.\r\nIn addition, Riot is continuing to remove more and more point-and-click abilities from the game, making them skillshots in order to give them counterplay, especially p.-a.-c. CCs. However, this favors mobile champions even more, because it will be harder to lock them down since they can just dodge everything.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat could be done to slow this movement down? My suggestion would be a new type of CC, called **Cripple** (name subject to change). What it would basically do is disabling any dashes and blinks that a champion has, excluding {{summoner:4}}. This could be coupled with various slows of champions who struggle against mobile champions, or could just need some love. Some examples (keep in mind these are only **ideas**):\r\n\r\n{{champion:34}} It has been a long time since Anivia has fallen out of favor, considering half of the champions can dash over her wall. Even Froggen has dropped her because of Mobility Creep. However, **Cripple** would be a neat addition to her Q (and possibly her E), preventing pesky assassins from hopping around and doing **#LC$B1GPL4Y$**.\r\n\r\n{{champion:60}} **Cripple** could perhaps be added to her Cocoon, lasting for maybe 1 - 2 second after the stun has expired, since victims often tend to just dash away before you can eat &#039;em up.\r\n\r\n{{champion:3}} Q maybe?\r\n\r\n{{champion:30}} could also make great use of this, but honestly i don&#039;t know where to add it (seems a bit overwhelming for his E)...\r\n\r\n{{champion:117}} A bit more peel for her Q could fit her quite nicely.\r\n\r\n{{champion:99}} would love this, but again, i can&#039;t seem to find a place for it.\r\n\r\n{{champion:21}} Another great candidate for a **Cripple**: Added to her Make it Rain, it would give the ability some actual use.\r\n\r\n{{champion:82}} Would look super awesome on his ult (even feel a bit like Doom&#039;s Doom from DotA), but maybe too strong.\r\n\r\n{{champion:56}} Don&#039;t know about his current state, but perhaps for his tether.\r\n\r\n{{champion:20}} Would maybe make his ult too strong, but if we lowered the slow...\r\n\r\n{{champion:113}} Would make sense thematically, though she had quite some spotlight recently.\r\n\r\n{{champion:27}} It&#039;s mega glue, not some sort of sticky honey...\r\n\r\n{{champion:72}} GIMME BACK MAH STICKINESS! T.T\r\n\r\n{{champion:91}} I would really like it for his E, although the salt may still be too strong...\r\n\r\n{{champion:6}} In addition to the slow from his shield.\r\n\r\n{{champion:110}} Similar to MF, for his E.\r\n\r\n{{champion:45}} This poor little guy... I wouldn&#039;t begrudge him this one...\r\n\r\n{{champion:161}} Maybe if he procced his passive or something.\r\n\r\n{{champion:143}} Her E Plants would love it...\r\n\r\nAnyways, you get the idea of it. It&#039;s similar to a silence, but not even close to it in terms of toxicity. You can still CC the enemy, and for emergency cases, you still have {{summoner:4}}. \r\n\r\nI would really appreciate your opinions on this.

You're looking at 400-500 range a lot of the time. And most of those are projectiles which are disjointed by mobility spells.\n\nWhich is why stuns aren't actually considered the best mobility counter. That falls to silences, which have extremely generous durations in Dota. Like, 5-7 second silences. It's obnoxious on high-mobility champions. And you can buy a 5 second silence item, or a 3.5 second polymorph item (also disables items, preventing self-purging), though their prices rival ADC items. \n\nWhich is in turn countered by silences being purgable, but stuns being entirely uncleansable (barring a handful of hero-specific abilities.)\n\nAnd so on. There are a lot of differences, but you're right that the essential reason that mobility is less abusable in dota is that there are more tools available to use against it.","replies":[{"poster":"Stiv1234","date":"2015-06-02T13:28:36.085+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's why i wrote 3 seconds CC instead of 3 seconds stun. :) I actually meant the kinds of Drow/Death Prophet/Skywrath anyway.

I knew even then that mobility creep was going to cause huge problems for the old, immobile designs that had been there from the beginning. I knew that without those champions receiving significant help that they would eventually become outclassed by their mobile counterparts. Now, in season 5, we live in the world I had foreseen then, where champions without mobility are largely ignored. Riot has had a VERY long history of consistently underestimating the power of mobility in their own game.\n\nThey also have a long history of failing to foresee the unintended consequences of balance changes that they make (although their changes are often good at solving the problem they were engineered to fix). This recent movement to get rid of p.-a.-c. CCs is just the latest example: They are trying to remove the profound lack of counterplay inherent in targeted CC by making them skillshots (an entirely logical solution to the problem), but in doing so they are indirectly giving mobility a huge buff (which as I have already pointed out champs with mobility are very privileged in LoL as it is).\n\nThe thing that bothers the most in all of this is that it feels like riot fails to learn from their mistakes. It had been apparent for a long time that mobility is incredibly powerful (many of the marksmen that were added in season 3 and season 4 showed that it was very strong on that archetype, the season 2 fighters showed tanky dudes with mobility were also very strong, etc.), yet they turned around and made Kalista recently, and Yasuo, both of whom are very mobile, and as a result very powerful (and unsurprisingly both have been subject to mostly nerfs since their respective releases. They even wrote in their design blog about how they had made the mistake of giving certain champions overloaded kits, and yet they turned around and soon thereafter released Jinx (who has a very overloaded kit and has been subject to LOTS of nerfs and yet remains one of the best marksman in the game).\n\nIn pretty much all of these cases, and many, many more, I have been able to foresee these imbalances sometimes before I had even seen the champion being played in game. Jinx in particular I knew was going to be absolutely broken on release and she was (and despite significant nerfs since then remains one of the better marksman in the game). I was not alone in making the prediction, and when I have made balance predictions, I've usually been right. If I can make predictions like that on a consistent basis, why can't the folks at riot, who have a dedicated team of people that work on the game's design and it's balance not foresee these things?","replies":[{"poster":"AlexXeno","date":"2015-06-02T03:13:22.190+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"To add to this, Riot has admitted they were fools with the mobility creep, or at least one of the designers did. and said they would be trying to fix it in the future.. then they made kilista...and Ekko... so yeah, didn't learn.

And everyone wants this so the mobility \"Meta\" is created because that is the most fun for them as they have better scores from either killing more or dying less.\nBut the fact of the matter is that why do we have to play ONLY champs with dashes and blinks?\n {{champion:266}} {{champion:82}} {{champion:68}} {{champion:110}}  Are all very fun for me, because of there lore, abilities, and out of the norms kits. And have** very limited** or no mobility at all.  \n\nSo where does mobility come in here?\n{{champion:83}} {{champion:82}} {{champion:2}} {{champion:266}}  are examples of low mobility champs, that fit certain comps.\n\nbut will you ever see them played a lot or competitively?\n**NO**\nWHY?\nbecause there are a handful of champs that do there job to a T, and can stick to targets, or escape over a wall or dash away from danger. And that s what makes the Lc$ B!G Pl4Y$, which i have to attribute mobility creep, and a lot of meta problems (off topic) to. \n\nThe fact of the matter is that mobility is becoming the EX of pokemon cards. Where they have to create over complicated champions that do tons of stuff. That destroys all other before it. Then make another over complicated champ that trumps the last over complicated one.\n\n{{champion:245}} is the PEAK of mobility creep now.\n\n-AS steroid with 3 AA on hit\n-dash  **AND** blink WHO THOUGHT THAT THIS WAS HEALTHY\n-and an ult that resets you 4 seconds back in time.\n\n3 mobility abilities crammed into ONE kit.\n\nand here we are complaining about champs with one dash or blink.... while THIS is allowed to happen????\n\nAlso with the current nuking of silence, and click cc. they make mobility un-counterable. wheras before you could hit that hard stun, or silence them so they cannot dash out.
