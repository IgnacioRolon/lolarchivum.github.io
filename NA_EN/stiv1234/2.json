Ever since rank was a thing bot lane has been dominated by ranged adc.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2015-11-04T21:07:27.645+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because Graves is now a jungler and top, Quinn is a mid, jungler, or top (Recommended to be a roaming mid), and Kindred was made to jungle.\n\nI mean, we can easily shove an AP type champion who scales more with items like Azir and Morde.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Reaper Soraka","date":"2015-11-04T09:07:11.793+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've had a lot of fun with Blitzcrank+Anivia bot lane.
