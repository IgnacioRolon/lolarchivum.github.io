Twitch as an adc is already shit because of pink wards, and having you be able to see him would just crush him.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Solideus","date":"2016-08-11T20:50:07.495+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"So you mean red trinkets and pink wards will stay the same, but you're ALSO adding built-in detection methods for champions with stealth? \n\nThat's pretty good, but I'm a disappointed you're not doing a proper holistic overhaul of the stealth system. It's pretty archaic and surely not as good and well designed as it could be. When, if ever, might we se a proper stealth rework, then?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Support Position","date":"2016-09-14T08:53:36.429+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can you guys just not change stealth? Stealth is fine as is... Unless your gonna nerf is with better detection. That's fine. Honestly stealth in this game is the only stealth in any mobas that are actually good why ruin something that's fine .-.\n\nAlthough I guess your company is notorious for that...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dreadusa","date":"2016-08-15T21:56:44.635+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But why is stealth being changed?   There are several ways to prevent something like a Shaco popping you or a Rengar ulting you.  Buy a pink ward, stick to your team, don't position poorly, don't position poorly early game and avoid feeding the assassin.","replies":[]}]}
