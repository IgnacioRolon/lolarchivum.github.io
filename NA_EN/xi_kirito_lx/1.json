There's a noticeable change in ping.  It's happened for a few months now, and it's consistent among all of her skins.\r\n\r\nAny idea why this would happen?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-03-02T04:27:27.432+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I haven't seen any other reports about this, so it's likely caused by something local to your PC. So you see changes in your latency (ping) rather than changes in your framerate (FPS) when she uses her E?","replies":[{"poster":"xI Kirito lx","date":"2017-03-02T04:40:28.816+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, I figured it was my computer.  Just weird.  But yeah, Ping gets hit, not FPS.  Doesn't make sense.  It spikes from 60-ms to about 130-ms.  \n\nIt's a minor enough glitch, and outside of URF it's not very impactful.  Still, interesting.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-03-02T23:49:22.313+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To ensure there isn't an issue with one or more of your local network settings, I'd like you to work through the steps outlined in our [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) in their entirety.\n\nIf this doesn't cause any change to your symptoms in-game, let me know so we can further troubleshoot this together. ^.^","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Sephir53","date":"2017-02-28T21:20:47.847+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"no i desagree i play syndra with one of her skins and i'm not lagging its may be your computer wich don't have enought power","replies":[]}]}
