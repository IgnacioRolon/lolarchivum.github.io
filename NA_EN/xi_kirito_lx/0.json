I didn't have to logg in when it reopened.  \r\n\r\nWhy does it open three separate processes?  And why are they all required processes?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-23T03:48:28.055+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not on the team that worked on the new client, so I don't have a direct answer for you.
