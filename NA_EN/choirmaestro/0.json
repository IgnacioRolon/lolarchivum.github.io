Now, I typically play her as a support, but after poking around the internets looking for some recommended build guides, I found that there are some people who choose to play her mid, or even occasionally on top. What do you guys think is her **_best_** role?\r\n\r\nI know that in Support she has excellent kiting and poke with her kit, and early game is excellent (I've gotten **FIRST BLOOD** for myself or my ADC a few times just by poking down the enemy's {{champion:99}} or {{champion:267}} to almost no-health, then ambushing from behind)","replies":[{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2016-06-09T20:02:30.639+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I actually really like playing her top.  You can stomp just about any melee top laner in the game, and do well against the ranged ones.  The amount of kiting and early harass/burst makes it impossible for them to do anything.  I start just using W on them as soon as they get close to the minions and then hitting them with RQ as the snare starts.  Throw in a jungle gank and you've got an easy first blood to snowball off of.\n\nThe only problem is you have to be sure that you have a tank jungle or support, and that your team isn't overloaded with magic damage.","replies":[{"poster":"Choirmaestro","date":"2016-06-11T18:51:12.695+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Seems like that would be best if you're duo-queue with your jungle or support then?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Mig89","date":"2016-06-09T19:59:20.811+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Support is her best spot in my experience. She can turn bot into a kill lane pretty easily with the right adc.

I don't play karma much but ive played enough against her to know that. Karma is good against a lot of tank supports. Blitz or thresh can give her a tough lane but it comes down to how you dodge skill shots. It all depends on how you play her too. If the enemy is aggressive you can max her shield and itll make the lane a little easier. In the right hands karma is a meta pick or close to it. I seen her in some LCS games so the pros trust her enough to play her.","replies":[{"poster":"Choirmaestro","date":"2016-06-11T18:50:35.860+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, I know Morg counters a lot of supports and CC-based supports, but as I said I **_blind_** picked Karma against Morgana.
