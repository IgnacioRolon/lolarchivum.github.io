Whenever i scent someone i see a trail, however, the trail becomes disconnected most of the time half way. Someone would have like 10% hp and trigger my blood scent, i follow it, it it stops midway. Then i zoom over to the low hp champ thats marks and around him theres no trail, just a mark on top of his head. Never had this problem with other warwick skins.\r\n\r\nALSO on a side note, for the part of the trail thats actually visible, since scent is trail is yellow its a bit harder to see than red, it blends into the ground. Can you guys make it a bit more easier to see pls, such as adding darker border or making it brighter?","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2018-02-08T20:36:14.587+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Stealth Panda,\nThanks for the report!

There is also a pretty obvious volibear bug after new patch. Go attack a monster, if you first use your e to dmg them, their hp will regenerate fast until the fear is over. I have to auto atk the monster first before i can use my e to overcome this bug.\n\nIm not sure if the same applies to enemy champions too havent tested it out yet.\n\nIts got many upvotes pretty fast, heres link: https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report/w781jPkm-new-obvious-volibear-bug\n\nIm a hardcore Volibear main, please look into this.
