I understand what happened to his ult after the update. However Im pretty sure what i just saw was a bug here&#039;s what happened:\n\nSo I stunned enemy Lux right next to 2 minions. She was literally a Teemo away from them OR LESS. Then I ulted her and guess what happened? The ult just hit lux and disappeared, even thoough there were 2 minions literally right next to her.\n\nNot sure whats triggering this bug, but what happened was the split second just before my ult landed, lux was out of stun and used shield. Perhaps when enemy champion (lux) shield JUST BEFORE (miliseconds) Brand&#039;s ult lands and there are only minions beside enemy champ, the ult will disappear? Not sure but it is what happened and the enemy lux also saw that happen and think its a bug. Since Riot recently modified his ult coding to fix a previous bug, perhaps they messed something up which caused a new bug? PLEASE LOOK INTO THIS RIOT. :)","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-02-05T16:56:51.129+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey AngryPanda 77 - \n\nThanks for the report!

Since you guys already knew about this but didn't disable brand, can I get a loss prevented or erase one of my losses from placement record? \n\nThanks :)","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-02-08T17:23:40.272+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Unfortunately, we won't be able to give you a loss prevented/remove the game from your history.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Totalwanabe","date":"2016-02-06T18:02:27.414+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"what they should do is prevent brand from being selectable until the fix come in atleast for ranked or every mode if it's too much hassle.","replies":[{"poster":"Stealth Panda","date":"2016-02-07T05:29:42.887+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Totalwanabe,realm=NA,application-id=LqLKtMpN,discussion-id=MXrxxlsb,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2016-02-06T18:02:27.414+0000)\n>\n> what they should do is prevent brand from being selectable until the fix come in atleast for ranked or every mode if it's too much hassle.\n\nYah i agree with this, if hes bugged why not disable him? I guess there are so many other champs that are bugged as well they cant disable them all! This kinda hints at how buggy this game really is. But then again, all games are buggy. :D","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TheLastShadow45","date":"2016-02-05T06:27:25.658+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"I keep seeing this kind of post but have never seen it in any game I have had with a brand.","replies":[{"poster":"Stealth Panda","date":"2016-02-05T06:59:35.869+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=TheLastShadow45,realm=NA,application-id=LqLKtMpN,discussion-id=MXrxxlsb,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2016-02-05T06:27:25.658+0000)\n>\n> I keep seeing this kind of post but have never seen it in any game I have had with a brand.\n\nMost of the time bugs only happen when certain conditions are met thats why riot failed to Detect this before until now.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Bijorn","date":"2016-02-08T17:49:27.780+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have seen this bug many times since the fix of his ult prioritizing champs regardless of if they are ablaze or not.
