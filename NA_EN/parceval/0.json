I'd be far more interested in the ability to amplify my own towers and base. We need something to combat the dive-game, and an Earth dragon is the perfect ticket.\n\nSecond: If the dragon spawns are random, and if we can get at most ~5 spawns before 35m, then won't this system inevitable result in certain comps just being lucky based upon which dragons spawned? Let's say, for example, that you're a comp that relies heavily on movement speed based initiation. If the Air Dragon spawns first, your team just won the lottery, but if it spawns 4th, you can get at MOST one. Isn't that a bit of an unfortunate reality which negates strategic play? Or is the lottery intended?\n\nEDIT: I would like to note that I definitely love the direction this is taking. No matter how it plays out, it will make for a more engaging, and better, Rift. \n\nEDIT2: I can't change the title of the post... very annoying how it swapped to R9K instead of RNG...

Do bear in mind what the new definition of \"good dragon\" will be in this new iteration, as all it will mean is that the dragon is relevant to either team, as that would automatically give it value to the other team and that's not only talking about denying it. If a poke heavy comp got the water buff then their poke potential would increase accordingly, whereas the other team getting it would increase their poke-resistance accordingly. Of course if the new stacking buff became so overwhelming that a team with certain buff combinations became unbearable then Riot would be able to change the numbers accordingly to manage the issue.\n\nAn example of a \"bad dragon\" would be a water one where say both teams had negligible poke and any champ that used mana had enough regen to not worry about it. Another would be an earth dragon during a game where neither team comp had split pushing potential nor seiging power, meaning turrets would only fall after successful teamfights like they would have anyway.\n\nTLDR - A team powerspiking should take advantage of that accordingly as it means they successfully remained a threat. If a team can't recover from a dragon capture then either the winning team successfully abused whatever advantages they had or the numbers on the buffs would need to be balanced.","replies":[{"poster":"Wolfeur","date":"2016-04-20T01:20:07.245+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"The concern is that the award they get is random.

A highly tanky team, or just an early-game team that wants to overpower with base damage, would have much lower benefit from the AD/AP multiplier since they don't purchase as much to be multiplied, nor would they benefit much if they did. A straight-up damage multiplier, or some penetration (total armor % penetration would make it effective regardless of enemy team comp) would (imo) do a better job of being appealing to all champions rather than only having value in denying the opponent for some. Having it only apply against enemy champions would also help focus it as a \"teamfight\" buff rather than just making carries stronger at everything. Alternatively, having some special effect when an enemy champion is CC'd might do an even better job; not saying this particular implementation would be perfect, but something like gaining movespeed for every nearby enemy champion affected by CC would make it desirable for both engaging or disengaging, bringing it in line as the buff that you want if your team wants 5v5 teamfights, while also being a buff you want yourself if the enemy wants to engage on you.\n\nThe Earth dragon buff misses the mark even more. Bonus damage to objectives rewards offensive sieging, or rushing neutral objectives (such as sneaking a baron while the rest of your team sieges offensively, or if you want to siege but even with Earth dragon buff you need more power). However, it has no power at all defending against a siege, and very little when contesting an objective that the enemy already started. The only situation where it \"counters itself\" is if objectives are being traded: the team that is better at taking objectives wants to emphasize their win condition, while their opponents can use the buff to bring their objective taking power to a more competitive level. To phrase it differently, it's a buff which only encourages tower/objective trading, rather than contesting which was one of the main objectives of the changes in the first place (or so I'm told). Again, I can't guarantee that this particular thing would be a good implementation, but I think that a better option would be if the Earth dragon gave a buff which either activated at those objectives but only affected champions, or which only activated while near one of those objectives when an enemy champion is also involved. For example, it could grant a shield like the 2nd tier side lane turrets. For a team that wants to make aggressive objective-focused plays this would discourage the enemy team from contesting because of the advantage you get, while a team that is defending against that style would have the edge they need to stand on even ground with the team that otherwise had the confidence to be aggressive. \n\nI'm looking forward to seeing how the Dragon Chroma Pack impacts professional play, but I'm also interested in one more thing: There have been some vague mentions that the spawn order of dragons is \"not purely random\" i.e. it isn't just a 25% chance of each at any given spawn. Is there any more information about that? Like, is it weighted to be less likely to provide streaks or large stacks of a single dragon buff, or the opposite? Or maybe it's dependent on how long the previous dragon went unkilled, so a hotly contested dragon type is likely to come up again while one that could sit for a long time is undesired so won't show up again? Or maybe the game attempts to analyze the compositions themselves and provide its best guess for the popular dragons?","replies":[]},{"poster":"RoakOriginal","date":"2016-04-20T17:52:41.045+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am bit concerned about usefullnes of Eart dragon...

Let's say that we're on live. Both teams want dragon equally because the stats essentially mean the same to both teams. This ends up in the buffs feeling fairly generic and not very fun. However, if we look at something like blue buff, it's better for some champions. If it wasn't a good chunk of XP and gold for the jungler, a team with Rumble JG and Yasuo mid may never really take it. This isn't what Riot wants for the dragons, since they want each one to be contestable in some way. Riot wants a split between the two. If we go with the Water Dragon example, a team with Rumble and Yasuo (and insert low-mana cost ADC/Supp/Top) would, once again, not really need it. But they may still contest it, since it gives a good buff to the enemy team, who we'll say is a poke comp, and still gives some nice health regen. The Yasuo/Rumble team would have an interesting choice to make: Get it ASAP and don't let the poke comp get it, wait for the poke comp to come for it and contest it, cross-map a Rift Herald or even Baron, or try to push in towers to get ahead for the opposing push.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Pierce The Veal","date":"2016-04-19T20:30:18.358+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=WC Prince,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Iw38mkWO,comment-id=0007,timestamp=2016-04-19T20:10:42.182+0000)\n>\n> The thing about that is that creating a dragon that is purely defensive is universally good on every team.
