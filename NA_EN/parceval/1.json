I'll just copy the post I made yesterday:\n\nI really don't see the point of allowing duos in \"solo\" queue at all. It doesn't really eliminate the problems of DQ, just lessens them. Namely:\n\n1) Legitimate boosting is still allowed, since people can duo with high ranking smurfs and get winrates they wouldn't get by themselves. That includes paid boosting, which is an abomination for any ladder with any semblance of competitive integrity.\n\n2) It doesn't completely level the playing field. Duos still have an unfair advantage over solos since they can practice together, have easier access to voice coms and generally work well together. Specially a support/ADC duo.\n\n3)It makes matchmaking problematic because even though duos can potentially have an advantage, it doesn't necessarily mean they do. If they don't put a handicap on duos they'll have an advantage over the other team if they have things like voice comms or trained together. And on the other hand if they're just random people that happened to queue together but don't really have comms or played before etc, then the team hosting them will be on a disadvantage because the system will handicap the matchmaking accounting for an advantage that isn't really there.\n\n4)Allowing duos in Solo Queue makes the Flex Queue less viable. Duos and trios complement eachother and 5s are self sufficient, so only 4s need solo players. By funneling duos into the flex queue they don't need to worry as much about attracting solo players.\n\nBack when there was only one ladder, it made sense to allow duos into solo queue, because people who wanted to play with a friend would have no other way to do that. But now we have 2 separate ladders and you can be part of both at the same time, so the reason doesn't exist anymore. Just play solo on solo queue and hop over to flex for the games when you want to premade with friends.

Accounts with suspect IP changes (such as people playing ranked games in another city etc) are already automatedly flagged for review. There also systems in place that keep track of your average APM ratio and other patterns, and flag accounts that shows suspect variations. Even changing your password then changing it back can cause your account to be flagged. About a year ago Lyte said in a podcast that they managed to clamp down on account boosting so efficiently that by then it was almost statistically negligible. \n\nAnd even if that was not the case, how is this an argument? If we can't find a perfect solution does that mean we should implement an improvement? I don't think that makes sense at all.\n \n> 2.

Even if you win the game it won't have been as enjoyable as if you were playing on even grounds, and it feels doublly bad to lose lane because the opponent had an unfair advantage. Statistically it might even out winrates, but it does nothing for your enjoyment of the matches.\n\n> 3.

Or maybe they don't have comms or can't use them at the time (it's late at night or something). I could go on and on. And it does make a huge advantage in lane, which can be translated into an advantage in-game if you snowball other lanes. Imagine this scenario: you're a midlaner playing an even or slightly advantageous lane so far. Then bot lane loses hard and you're collapsed on by the support and ADC. \n\n> 4.

There is no valid reason not to implement true solo alongside flexQ, the only reason I hear stated is that people want to bring the advantages of premades to an otherwise solo environment, that's an advantage to personal benefit, not to the health of the queue. Have you already forgotten how duos were the main complaint of solo/duoQ? Where you even playing back then? Why take a step back when they have the chance to completely correct their mistake and keep their promise?","replies":[{"poster":"Parceval","date":"2016-11-10T23:29:28.106+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Agreed.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Splashworks","date":"2016-11-10T08:28:33.533+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":4,"body":"I disagree...Despite the obvious point of the solo queue ladder showing who the best individual players are, sometimes carrying 4 people depending on matchmaking is very difficult considering you are 1/5 of your team.\n\nAlthough, if I'm confident in my duo, then that is a much larger impact on the game and it seems to be less of a \"please don't match me with plebs\" system.\n\nI feel like pure solo queue all the time would become a roulette for some such as myself.

The one where the duo of two guys that want to climb together can be faced with a fate worse than a solo going against a duo, the fate that exists as 3 man and duo vs a single duo and a bunch of solo's. Fantastic idea. /s\n\nYou're literally contradicting yourself; it's ok for you to only face solos, but the duos aren't allowed to face another duo? They HAVE to deal with 3 mans and 5 mans? How's that fair? \"How's it fair if the solo has to face a duo\" It's not, but it's way way way less unfair than a duo vs 5 man or 3 man. Besides, if you lose vs a duo and you were in a solo lane, that's either your fault for not communicating with your teammates or your team's fault for not giving you a helping hand...Although I personally welcome a duo attempting to camp me in a solo lane. I, personally, like challenge. I don't like it as much in bot lane, but that's because I'm not a very good adc for people around my level. Something i need to work on personally though.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
