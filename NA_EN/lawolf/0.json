I could see it happening if modifications to the config files were changed, but I'd like to help get this fixed either way.  You were on the right track in deleting the input file, but in order to reset your settings to a fresh state it will be necessary to delete the whole folder:\n\n **Log into the game** then hop into **a custom game**. *Alt+Tab* out of the match, then navigate to your League installation folder, which should be in C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\n\nDelete the folder named **Config**\n\nOnce you've deleted the folder, leave the custom match. You'll then want to hop into another custom match to confirm the changes were saved.\n\nHopefully, that will get things working on!","replies":[]}]}
