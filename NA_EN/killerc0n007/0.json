It&#039;s clunky, feels like I&#039;m playing just a shitty Ahri. I play Leblanc because I want to assassinate an out of position ADC. Not use chains to peel the front line late game over and over. Yes Leblanc is good right now but we all know she&#039;s going to get gutted. I just want my smooth fun Leblanc back.

Imo, you're rewarded even more with how it works as opposed to before, there are lots more combos you can use and it feels really good to use a combo that best matches a specific situation.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"fancyassgrits","date":"2017-02-20T21:48:58.396+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"that's because you suck and not creative enough. \n\nNEW LB is harder to play but so what. She was  actually on the easier end of control then other assassins but in exchange her teamfight contribution was miniaml.
