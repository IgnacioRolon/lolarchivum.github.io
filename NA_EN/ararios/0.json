I specifically remember thinking of how it was useless in the past.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-07T02:25:18.033+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just checked for ya and that XP Boost is still on your account! Looks like it still has 17 wins remaining, should be a good boost once uncapped leveling hits live servers!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Valeeva","date":"2017-11-06T23:55:14.463+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes you will get them back.\n\nI talked with a member of support the other day about the exact same thing and was told my 7 Games XP boost was still on my account and would reactivate once the prepatch hit :)","replies":[]}]}
