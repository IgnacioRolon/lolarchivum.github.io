They don&#039;t seem to be bots, but what I have realized is that they are extremly friendly, and flirty (I have no idea if they know if I am a girl or not but it&#039;s creeping the hell out of me)\r\n\r\nSo my quesition is, has this happened anyone else than me? And do you know why and how?\r\n\r\nP.S I find it really strange that Diamond+ are adding me since I am only Gold\r\n/Thanks Cookie","replies":[]}
