These 12 champs along with the free to play champs should be enough to play ranked, but it tells me that I still need to own 20 champs. I am able to play draft, which requires 20 champs. Do the free to play champs count for draft, but not for ranked? If they do count towards the 20 needed for ranked is this a problem of sort or something I didn't do?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-17T23:19:31.512+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You need to personally have 20 champs unlocked to play ranked, not counting the free to play champs. Those are just a sample of some champs to test out before buying them possibly, so they don't count as being owned.","replies":[]}]}
