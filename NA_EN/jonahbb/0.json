Today I decided to record it.\r\n\r\nIt appears that every hour on the hour I jump from ~40 ping to ~250 ping. If I leave and rejoin the game, I return to my normal ping. However, if I do not leave, the ping seems to never drop back down.\r\n\r\nI know it seems strange but it happened at 12:00, 2:00, 4:00, and 5:00. It would seem like a strange coincidence.\r\n\r\nI was wondering if anyone had any insight on this problem or could recommend some steps I can take to troubleshoot it myself.\r\n\r\nThanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-03T22:04:08.224+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sudden spikes like this can be caused by network problems like packet loss.  This could result from a poor connection or even how your ISP is routing to the game server.  I recommend starting off by getting a clear overview of your specific issue through a [log reader](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743-Connection-Troubleshooting-Log-Reader).

Those logs are from 12, 1, 2, and 4 p.m.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/CP1x5\n\nLooking at my other logs, my ping seems stable.\n\nAs for next steps, think I should just go straight to talking to my ISP?\n\nThanks!\n\n*Edit: Hopefully as I monitor this, it might just fix itself and go away too.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-04T21:48:11.512+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the detailed info!
