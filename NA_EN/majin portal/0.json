So I hit the exit button and as soon as I did, everything started freezing up and lagging out on my PC and I had to manually shut down my laptop. The problem now is that I am unable to start up League. I've tried reinstalling and system restoring but as soon as it pops up and tries to run/the logo is trying to load; the processes automatically close. I'm trying to hurry up and fix this for a tournament coming up in 4 hours and would appreciate any help I can get.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-07-15T20:37:06.551+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"An OS or some antivirus update may be the cause here.
