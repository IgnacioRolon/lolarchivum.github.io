He tried to do the switch password and nothing, no email or anything.  He then tried contacting support and they are asking questions that would have required amazing memory or luck to guess properly.  Glad i got out of league a while ago and glad i did.  support has always been shitty and now they lost 2 players for sure.  means nothing i know, there's millions others but still.\n\noh, forgot to mention, they apparently allowed for acct information and email to be swapped without sending any conformation for the previous address.  good job Riot","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-12T21:55:43.099+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Account security is super important, so we take strict measures when assisting with recovery.
