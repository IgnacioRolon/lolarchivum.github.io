As a result, I am unable to provide you with access to the account. Please understand that these steps are taken to ensure the security of our players and their accounts.\r\n\r\n> I know this can be frustrating, so please contact me again if you remember any more information about the account.\r\n\r\n> MERCYKILLER12\r\n> Player Support Specialist\r\n> Riot Games\r\n\r\n>   \"ASCEND\"\r\n\r\n\r\nNow this worries me as im 100% sure the information i provided was correct as i have a habbit of saving details in the signup menu for anything i sign up for in a notepad document. I had changed the signup email to more up to date personal email within the past couple of months i included the email change and password change link and code i was sent from Riot in the support ticket i also included information as to what my IP was at the time of creation. The account was created and not bought or shared as i know that is against the TOS i  have sent a reply to the recent reply by the support specialist giving them the info that i had writen down in my notepad. Consisting of the below im just wondering as to why this would not be 1) sufficent enough or 2) how the details i saved when i created the account would be wrong.\r\n\r\nAccount Name : \r\nSummoner Name :\r\nThe server you play on : \r\nCreation date of the account :\r\nOriginal email address used to register the account: \r\nLocation where you registered the account : \r\nList of locations that you have played on this account : \r\nLast IP address used to play League of Legends: \r\nInternet Service Provider (ISP)/Internet Carrier when registering the account:\r\nHow did you first come into possession of the account: \r\n\r\nAny help/Thoughts are appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-10T23:54:17.283+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can't speculate why you haven't been able to recover this account since I'm not the agent working your ticket. Since you're already working with a recovery specialist, I encourage you to continue working with them and do your best to provide them with the most accurate and complete information as you can.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lilyard","date":"2016-10-10T19:28:14.643+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I recently contacted support for the same reason and got the same response. Atm, I do not believe they are even attempting to recover the accounts. Could you email the original email address? Notice the sudden change of IP addresses and locations of where the game is being played? Play style change on the player. I'm a support player and now the account is full Jungle and Mid? Obviously not me. I don't know what they want. \n\nLets say yours above, maybe one of the ISP rebranded or something? I have no idea what I or you may of typed wrong. I didn't know the creation date exactly, is that it? Is month and year not good enough? Next is location based on where the ISP located or is it my physical address? I gave physical, so I'd assume that, but I may be wrong.\n\nI wish you the best of luck on recovering your account friend. Currently, I have no faith.","replies":[]}]}
