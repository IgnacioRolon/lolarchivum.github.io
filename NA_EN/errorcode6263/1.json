I will start around 400 FPS (Vert Sync and AA off) or 60 FPS (V-Sync and AA on) but by the end of the game its 200 FPS and 30 FPS respectively. The card is still before its temperature throttle recording in at a max temperature of 71 or so. I was wondering if there was a reason I was seeing a drop of almost half of my frames as I would like to be able to play with V-Sync and AA on. \r\n\r\nDrivers and league are completely updated and other games on my PC seem to run fine reaching 60 or so FPS on ultra consistently it just seems to be LoL that has the issues. \r\n\r\nThanks! {{champion:99}}","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-07T06:00:50.644+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is the card at a stock overclock or did you overclock it past its factory settings?","replies":[{"poster":"ErrorCode6263","date":"2016-12-07T20:52:49.434+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Custom Overclock using MSI Afterburner.
