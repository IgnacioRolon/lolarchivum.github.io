As it is right now, he can lose lane 0-3, not snowball at all, and if his team is even half-decent and plays defensively, he can still splitpush effectively and win the game without team-fighting even once. This is non-interactive as hell, kinda boring, and far more pressing than the *possibility* to snowball once in a while. He needs a complete rework, not just some tuning regarding his early Crit.\n\nAnd I play Tryndamere myself, so I'll be sad when he is changed, but I'll still acknowledge that's a good thing for the game as a whole.\n\n(Also, Trynd Crit is in the order of 10-30%, that's not the same scale as a 1 or 2% Crit Rune, either.)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Quepha","date":"2016-10-26T05:43:35.489+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've still never seen a single clip of RNG being the sole deciding factor in a tryndamere game, never seen it in any game I've played either.

He is basically that kind of champion that actually punish you for trying to play safe with his mobility and mocking shout who is often difficult to punish if he loses out on an engage. He's bad in team fights unless the opposing team for whatever reason lacks hard CC so he just splitpushes all game. ults and then spins away.
