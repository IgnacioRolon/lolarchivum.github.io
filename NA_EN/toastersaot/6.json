They're just still figuring out how to make 10 bans happen without making the draft phase longer. I imagine that on top of having 2 bans per side at a time, they'll add something like a ready button where you can preload your ban and it will lock in a few seconds after it's your turn so that you can still click to unready. Perhaps the ban phase could also be limited in time like 10 secs per person (except for player 1 due to connecting and stuff), but while removing the penalty when missing out your ban. It's an opportunity, if you miss your ban, you just lost that advantage.","replies":[{"poster":"GayFluffyUnicorn","date":"2016-08-25T15:06:52.864+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Like SoloQ happened?","replies":[{"poster":"Dr Poro","date":"2016-08-26T03:13:21.894+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"true dat.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"XxbekfestxX","date":"2016-08-24T11:06:18.436+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":5,"body":"lol yet theirs more ekko nerfs on pbe man #leaveekkoalone","replies":[{"poster":"Oakleaf Ranger","date":"2016-08-24T11:13:20.677+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"I smelly a filthy tank ekko main","replies":[{"poster":"paisy","date":"2016-08-24T11:25:31.110+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"I'm annoyed because the nerf is hurting ap Ekko as well","replies":[{"poster":"Junkο","date":"2016-08-24T12:57:20.996+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":3,"body":"Implying AP Ekko doesn't deal too much damage either (as a result of getting a shit ton of AP ratio compensations when tank Ekko got nerfed).

I prefer Phantom Dancer for its dueling ability.\n\nThe reason they also build frozen mallet (which btw took a big nerf on pbe) is because you slow targets.\nSo, you having big movement speed + mobility from E + them getting slowed = you get a lot of auto attacks out. And fervor gives your a bunch of dmg for that.\n\nSimilar for Ekko. He has mobility on E + his passive slowing the enemy target + q slowing the enemy target.
