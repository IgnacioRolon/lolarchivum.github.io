Apparently Tank Yasuo is a thing, and how we should change him.","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":62,"down_votes":16,"body":"Yasuo currently has a 52.4% Winrate Top Lane. This usually wouldn&#039;t be a problem (hell, Morde Jungle had a 55% Winrate last patch) but currently he is one of the most popular Champions in the game with a 11% playrate.\r\n\r\nKorean Build Lucian had a similar play rate and Winrate, and he was considered absoultely broken.\r\n\r\nOnly now, Yasuo&#039;s standard build, two Crit items and then AD, armor pen, and bruiser, is being replaced by Tank Yasuo.\r\n\r\nTank Yasuo has NO CRIT, and instead goes {{item:3078}} {{item:3111}} {{item:3022}} {{item:3026}} {{item:3068}} {{item:3053}}  in that order. This build has a 54% Winrate top lane.\r\n\r\nFrankly, I think the problem here is the high base damage on his abilities, followed by the sustained damage Fervor gives and the stickiness of Frozen Mallet.\r\n\r\nSo I think we should do this:\r\n\r\n1: Increase reliance on Crit to damage by reducing base damage in his Q and E. As somebody else pointed out earlier, Q base damage is a decent, and the Crit penalty could make people want to build tank.\r\n\r\n2: Make his E do physical damage. This would mean building Armor is always good. E is also maxed first because of its base damage being higher than that of his Q . Even with the armor pen on his ult, E will do less damage because people will stack armor.  Also, why does a guy sweeping through someone with a sword deal MAGIC Damage? Never understood that.\r\n\r\n3: Nerf Ult&#039;s armor pen. This is basically giving Tank Yasuo the final bit of oomph to kill enemies. I think that a good change would be to make his Ults armor pen apply ONLY to attacks that Crit. This means he must build Crit to do damage to enemies with armor.\r\n\r\n\r\nDownvotes me to hell, I already know where I&#039;m going.","replies":[{"poster":"TTK Dreadnought","date":"2016-08-03T18:56:39.042+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":30,"body":"Yasuo is a fighter.......","replies":[{"poster":"Marshbouy","date":"2016-08-03T18:57:06.898+0000","up_votes":27,"down_votes":5,"body":"but\nHES BUILDING TANK","replies":[{"poster":"Iageri","date":"2016-08-03T19:01:15.711+0000","up_votes":20,"down_votes":9,"body":"It's not really tank, it's a typical fighter build.. \n\nGaren, Gnar, Volibear, Mundo, and Darius.. \n\nThey all get pretty tanky, but surprisingly their main role is fighter. \n_______________________________________________________\n\nRight now Yas is played as a Mid lane Melee ADC, but apparently that falls off hard.... gee wonder why...","replies":[{"poster":"Marshbouy","date":"2016-08-03T19:04:27.220+0000","up_votes":25,"down_votes":3,"body":"you just listed 3 juggernauts.","replies":[{"poster":"TTK Dreadnought","date":"2016-08-03T19:10:27.227+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":1,"body":"Actually, 4 juggernauts.\n\nHowever, a Juggernaut is a champion who is a combination of fighter and tank.\n\nYasuo, even if building tankier, will not be able to out-tank those mentioned champions.\n\n{{champion:62}} {{champion:92}} {{champion:254}} are great examples of champs who have common fighter builds.\n\nEven {{champion:104}}  who is technically a marksmen, is built as a fighter half the time.","replies":[{"poster":"Iageri","date":"2016-08-03T19:12:42.894+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"But in game they're technically still marked under \"Fighter\"","replies":[{"poster":"BoundaryBreaker","date":"2016-08-03T19:41:14.802+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"So?
