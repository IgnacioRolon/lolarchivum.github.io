So far we have seen no trace of the Hemomancer in the Pro Scene. We haven&#039;t had that many games yet, however the games we have had come from Top Tier Korean teams like \nSKT, KT, and SSG. If Vladimir does not get picked or banned, what types of buffs will he receive? Will it be in 7.2, 7.3, or maybe even 7.4? \n\nEdit: This One http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/7sjq1gvo-meddler-would-the-vlad-buffs-that-were-hinted-at-be-in-72-like-nidalees?comment=0001\n\nThanks","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2017-01-19T01:15:31.854+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"He's looking like a reasonably likely candidate for 7.3 or 7.4 at this point, though can't guarantee that yet. Development on 7.2 stopped today apart from bug fixing, so there won't be any new balance changes going into the next patch beyond this point.","replies":[{"poster":"Quantux","date":"2017-01-19T06:49:16.310+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Vladimir is sitting at a poor win rate  but he has decent damage, i think you guys should look at the base cooldowns of W or E\nBut he needs MOVESPEED more than anything, even if he lost stats from Protobelt and a lot from Rylai's it would be ok if he could reach someone. Movespeed is what he needs the most IMO, hope u see this Meddler keep up the good work!\n\nCheers, Quantux","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Erockandroll","date":"2017-01-18T21:28:51.706+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Difficult to say, considering that Boards is pretty much in arms when Vlad is competitive. \n\nPersonally, I would have liked Riot to ease up on the HP based nerfs. (I like my Jugger-mage) And yet, a High defense build does seem to have it's counterplay issues. (When an SV rush buy, manages to invalidate any AP match up.)","replies":[]}]}
