He almost immediately stopped being picked in competitive. \n\nAfter his base HP and MS were nerfed, the Rylai's nerf is really starting to affect his usability. There's no reason Syndra, or even Sol for that matter, should be able to outrun him if she misses all of her skillshots. I've had it happen several times. Its practically impossible to go mid with him if you aren't going full-tank so you can just ignore their damage and sustain through it, but he's essentially a non-factor if you do so. That build has a 44% winrate compared to AP for a reason. \n\nThis is also the reason he's mostly played top now. He **can't function** vs anything ranged because they all have higher MS, higher CC, higher damage, higher range, and higher base stats than him.\n\nImproving his options vs ranged would be a good place to start if you want to hit his ranged vs melee interactions more. How do you do that? Base MS is a good start because he'll have a significantly higher buff relative to other ranged, but still significantly less MS than most melee.

People being unable to deal with arguably the easiest ranged vs melee match-up in the game is no excuse for keeping him weak. \n\nEvery game is just avoiding the inevitable flash->ignite cheese engage against anyone under plat for a free lane. Plat and above its practically impossible to lane against anyone with even the slightest pressure+ignite.\n\n________\n\nConsidering he just lost 100 HP from Rylai's, as well as a significant portion of the slow, giving him MS and HP to essentially revert nerfs in the past should be no issue, especially since he effectively had those before Rylai's was ever stupidly buffed in the first place. He's approaching a sub-44% winrate for fuck's sake. \n\nThis double-dip on HP and relative MS nerfs feels horrible. Even Darius can just run you down without any MS items when you start boots+pots.
