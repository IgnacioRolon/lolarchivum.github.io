That doesn&#x27;t help you know when it *is* going to occur though.\n\nThere is more warning than that.  You can see his fury bar.  You can manipulate his fury bar through playing back at it.  I can take advantages based upon that.  I can gain experience about the match-up.  I can learn when his window's of opportunity are and when mine are in that match-up.  I can learn when he has advantageous trades and when I do.  And you can do all this with crit chance.\n\nAnybody can list out an aspect of a champion and act like it is grossly unfair. But if a player doesn't know when trades are favorable for one or the other or underestimates the potential damage of a trade or all-in, that's a misplay.  I could complain that (old) LeBlanc jumps on me as Lux and removes my health without warning and that's unfair, maybe toss in the words \"mobility creep\" to get people to agree with me.  Or I could complain that Lux hits me as LeBlanc with damage from across the lane and that I go oom if I trade back, maybe toss in \"power creep\" to get people to agree with me when I get hit with a combo while hanging around when I'm in kill range.  But I would rather play both and learn the match-up.\n\nOther people don't.  I've seen Tryndamere threads on here; 70% of them are \"He keeps splitpushing! He can't do that!\" as if it is against the rules to not \"group up\" and then ARAM mid all game, and the 30% are slightly more sophisticated, and mentions his crit chance, unfortunately, usually in the terms of he crits from nowhere and that's toxic and unfair.\nWell no, it doesn't; it comes from his fury bar which we spent the last thirty seconds watching him constantly AA the minion wave to build up, and it's the other guy's fault for not doing anything before or after this.  So let's not say it there is no warning.\n\n> However, this is a problem with crit chance in general. Trynd&#x27;s problem is that he is entirely reliant on it.\n\nThat's not true.  If Tryndamere really is entirely reliant on lucky crits, like the threads say, or entirely reliant on crit chance in general, why do the top Tryndamere players keep building things like Ravenous Hydra, Blade of the Ruined King, and Black Cleaver?  Shouldn't they be rushing IE and 100% crit if he is entirely reliant criting?\nTryndamere is reliant on pressuring the map which low elo players suck at dealing with and that explains the threads we get for certain champions.","replies":[{"poster":"Ariel the Cruel","date":"2016-11-26T14:28:43.400+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Tryndamere gains 0.35% crit chance per point of fury - maxing out at 35%.\nWith even 1 point of fury, Tryndamere has the potential to crit.

That's the heart of the problem.\nLB has cooldowns and mana costs. [Old] LB's burst came out fast, but you at least knew when it couldn't happen. Crit doesn't have that luxury.
