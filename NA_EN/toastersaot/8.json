I love awful, disgusting champions top lane like {{champion:41}} and {{champion:8}} .\n\nHowever, I&#039;ve really been noticing something. My Jungler just doesn&#039;t like coming top, and I really can&#039;t blame them. \n\nRift Herald is just not as efficient to take as Dragon, especially Infernal. If the Jungler with the mid laner, and kill  the enemy bot lane with a 4-man dive, they get Bot turret (4-people smacking a non-fortified turret for that First Blood Gold) Dragon, 2-3 kills. In most games, many people just ignore it, since it just meant for splitpushing and gives little to the entire team. I liked the old rift Herald which gave minions that mini Baron buff better, since it gave the Jungler an reason to come top, even if it was to just snag up that buff every few minutes. Now Rift Herald just seems ignored to me.\n\nEdit: I was tired af when writing this post, and I can give a good summary now I think.\n\nDragon: Can be soloed by a good number of champions who have decent single target DPS, such as {{champion:121}} , {{champion:254}} ,{{champion:64}} , {{champion:120}} , but it can benefit the whole team for the ENTIRE duration of the game, and leads into a much more powerful Late Game with the Elder Drake buff, which is given to everybody on the team.\n\nRift Herald: Takes 2-3 people to kill, and only benefits on every of them directly. Splitpushing is a good way to help your team, but if your a tank or a teamfight oriented top laners(my highest mastery point tops are all AOE team fighters, {{champion:41}} ,{{champion:8}} ,{{champion:14}} ) Rift Herald just isnt that great for the long run either, because it expires after 20 Minutes. It takes multiple people to kill to benefit one champion, which just doesn't feel good.","replies":[{"poster":"SGT Dingle Berry","date":"2016-12-21T16:57:11.258+0000","up_votes":30,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rift herald just takes too damn long to kill making you a sitting duck for a mediocre buff.","replies":[{"poster":"Darth Sidiouss","date":"2016-12-21T17:33:44.920+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"its not mediocre its pretty damn good if your split pushing, 1v1 potential and more opportunities to 1v2 when the JG comes top for you.","replies":[{"poster":"Erockandroll","date":"2016-12-21T18:43:55.533+0000","up_votes":21,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Yeezy Taught you,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=rRLuhPWn,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2016-12-21T17:33:44.920+0000)\n>\n> its not mediocre its pretty damn good if your split pushing, 1v1 potential and more opportunities to 1v2 when the JG comes top for you.\n\nI think the real problem is that Rift herald isn't really fun to take.\n\nWith Dragon, many champs can solo it, but everyone focuses dragon because everyone benefits. \n\nWith Rift herald, you usually need 2 or more people to defeat it, just to get a buff that will at most effect one person. There's no greed in helping top laner get that buff, taking rift herald is purely a supportive task. \n\nIf Riot is under the opinion that Rift Herald shouldn't be soloed, then I think it should grant at least 2 copies of the buff.

However, right now it really seems like it's only something you can take if you are already ahead in top or jung, since it requires so long to take.
