We're working on the pre-season patch right now, which has enough changes to the game in it that it'll disrupt balance across the board for a patch or two. We tend not to do individual champion balance adjustments in the pre-season patch or just before it unless they're really out of line as a result, given they'll shortly get shaken up a bit by the new environment. Kennen's getting some attention at present, I'd assume based off his World's play, he certainly doesn't seem like an urgent problem though, especially given that we've got Protobelt nerfs coming that we'd expect to noticeably impact him as one of its core users. We'll give him another look post pre-season see where he's ended up.","replies":[{"poster":"Sun Wu Ryuumoku","date":"2016-10-17T18:44:15.396+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Any nerf planned for Jayce presaison ? he's clearly overhelming toplane (same at world's ).

All of which give him CDR.   \n\nKennen's power is a direct result of the Mid Year Mage update, people are just now catching on because of worlds.    He does need toning down, but so does portobelt and rylais.    It's a multiple tiered problem.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Swiftstrike4","date":"2016-10-16T20:25:42.808+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think his some of his damage needs to be toned back. I am starting to see {{champion:85}} at support mid and top a lot more. Many of them don't do that well and are playing them just because the pros played them. The thing I am noticing though is that even though they may fall behind or die a few times early, their damage output remains extremely high by the end of the game. \n\nIt may be the itemization route and {{item:3152}} may be need to be toned down? I am not sure. \n\nIt just seems like he is a champion with few draw backs for play. He is a lane bully, has great damage scaling, is good at team fighting, and has a pretty good escape.\n\nI will say with all the {{champion:126}} and {{champion:85}} top picks it is getting difficult to play melee carries in that lane. Now we know {{champion:126}} will be indirectly nerfed because the armor pen builds will be changning, but nothing has really been discussed regarding Kennen.","replies":[{"poster":"SlyTactician ","date":"2016-10-17T19:25:58.689+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Protobelt is getting nerfed quite a bit as confirmed by Meddler, so I'm certain that Kennen and Rumble will both be impacted by it. \n\nKennen has always been a flex pick whether it be from top/mid to even adc or supp. It's just his recent popularity from worlds that has really caused him to gain notice.

Combine that with Kennen or even Annie or Rumble ults and you get squishies blown right off the map more easily than usual.\n\nIt's only now that the pros have shown the power of the combo of Kennen with protobelt that people have realized that he is indeed stronger than intended. Though consider the fact that most of his counters have also been nerfed as well prior to this. As a player with 250 k points on Kennen, his rise to popularity really showed up from the mage update ever since the overpowered status of the protobelt item. Nerf it and Kennen will be balanced.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SlyTactician ","date":"2016-10-17T19:15:23.622+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kennen's main strengths came from the over powered protobelt if anything as it allowed him to dish out additional damage that was far too strong combined with his ult.\n\nOther than that, Kennen had his W range reduced a couple months ago and has barely changed at all aside from some ult cleanup numbers from the mage update. Most of his competitiors were nerfed and along with the boost of  protobelt's damage, it's no wonder he's so popular at Worlds.  I really think nerfing protobelt will solve the issue - look at Rumble as well who also abuses the item.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Loboros","date":"2016-10-17T01:49:00.094+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I saw a lot of kennen mids when I was going into silver.
