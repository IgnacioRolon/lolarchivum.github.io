When I start LoL at first it won't open through the desktop shortcut so I open it with the admin launcher (lol.launcher.admin). Then it opens but as I get into the queue it just goes on forever. I tried playing with friends but the only thing that happens on their screen is just that I don't accept the match. My screen is a different story. I sit there waiting for it to find a match but nothing happens and the timer just keeps going. \r\nThis keeps happening all the time. Eventually, I gave up and thought that if I maybe reinstalled LoL it would work but it didn't. It keeps happening and I am getting so tired of only being able to play up to one game a day. \r\nAnother thing is that when I try to view my profile I just see a black screen with the layout for a profile then all of a sudden I disconnect. \r\nI know that it has nothing to do with the internet because it worked fine before we got faster and stronger internet but yeah then we got the faster and stronger internet and LoL just stopped working.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-08-05T20:54:03.401+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it sounds like you're having a combination of issues.  Since you're having to run as admin, you should go over the steps in the [permissions](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) guide.  This will make sure access is being allowed, so you don't run into other blocks after you've launched the client.\n\nPast that, your connection could also have trouble staying connected to the matchmaking service.  It's important to resolve that as missing matches can result in a dodge.  The steps in the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide should help fix that as well!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Longstriker","date":"2017-08-05T19:29:52.819+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would run the Hextech Repair Tool and than send the information that generates in a ticket to Riot Support.\n\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367-Automated-Troubleshooting-Hextech-Repair-Tool","replies":[]}]}
