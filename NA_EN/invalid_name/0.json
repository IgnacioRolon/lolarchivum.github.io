Like, jesus fucking christ, that's what balance changes are for. They're to ***balance the fucking champion***. If Riot removed shit as soon as it was strong there'd be no fucking League, because everything would have been removed immediately.\n\nAlso, [he doesn't](https://u.gg/lol/champions/aphelios/build/?rank=master_plus). Yeah, it's high, but there's quite a big difference between 75% and 90%.\n\n---\n\nEDIT: Yeah, I misread. Pick+Ban, not just ban. ***Regardless***, a champion being strong ***IS NEVER*** justification to outright delete them. It's called a fucking balance patch.","replies":[{"poster":"5050BS","date":"2020-01-10T19:50:34.038+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"Because IT IS A BAD DESIGN.\n\nWhy remove a seat belt design from a car that has killed 20% of those using it.

If you made a completely new design and it is faulty, it wastes time and money to continue to try and \"improve\" what has already worked before\n\nif there is a minor detail that can be corrected, fine, but if you have to re-invest time and research money into fixing new problems, things get expensive, especially in games with a model like league\n\nAphelios is one of the most conservative models they have used in a while, yet he still has various levels of overkill in his kit that better players have been able to find and point out their flaws for the health of the game\n\nI believe someone mentioned that he had over 1000 individual possible animations based on his combination mechanics, which makes him difficult to market.  He has tools for most situations (which also makes it difficult to balance)\n\nand if you really want to know that they just went overkill....it's possible to hit with over 1000% AD damage at level 6...","replies":[{"poster":"DuskDaUmbreon","date":"2020-01-12T10:25:04.497+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah.

And most of those animations will be similar, so you can copy-paste a significant chunk and change what you need to.\n\nYeah, it'd be longer for him than other champions, because of those combinations, but 1k animations sounds highly suspect.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
