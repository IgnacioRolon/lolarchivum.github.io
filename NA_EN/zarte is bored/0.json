I&#039;ve recently been permanently banned for &quot;extreme nature of toxic behavior&quot;, but was I really toxic? Honestly, I&#039;m standing here in unbelief by all of this. Is this what it comes down to in the end, having that one bad game where you must say something to your teammates and try to reason with them, just to get automatically suspended after? I swear I was not toxic, if anyone was, it&#039;s &quot;Leona&quot; and &quot;Xin Zhao&quot; in my team. I can describe the whole game which made me get &quot;banned&quot; but I want to keep it short as possible. I did not say even one offensive words, but still angry teammates reported me and instant feedback got me banned. Please review this, I&#039;ve been playing for a very long time. Whether you lift this ban or not, it&#039;s not really that important to me, I just can&#039;t stand injustice, and I took my time to submit this out of the pure reason that it happens a lot to others too.\r\nHere&#039;s the chat log.\r\n\r\nGame 1\r\nZarte Is Bored: jelde haha\r\nZarte Is Bored: ne igraju je ljudi\r\nZarte Is Bored: ne znaju\r\nZarte Is Bored: xin instead of talking do smth\r\nZarte Is Bored: lele\r\nZarte Is Bored: sure bruh\r\nZarte Is Bored: XIN\r\nZarte Is Bored: DEFF 1ST BLOOD DUDE\r\nZarte Is Bored: GO MID\r\nZarte Is Bored: u know\r\nZarte Is Bored: flaming won&#039;t make me play better\r\nZarte Is Bored: xd\r\nZarte Is Bored: whatever\r\nZarte Is Bored: lose\r\nZarte Is Bored: like i care\r\nZarte Is Bored: :D\r\nZarte Is Bored: at least im making u mad\r\nZarte Is Bored: 0/3 promo i lose nothing changes\r\nZarte Is Bored: tho u r so mad\r\nZarte Is Bored: ur parents prolly don&#039;t love u\r\nZarte Is Bored: xd im the only one not flaming in this team, except for aurelion\r\nZarte Is Bored: check my last games\r\nZarte Is Bored: and decide if im boosted\r\nZarte Is Bored: if u r so interested\r\nZarte Is Bored: pls.\r\nZarte Is Bored: don&#039;t bother flaming mates, i&#039;ll report u after\r\nZarte Is Bored: now muted\r\nZarte Is Bored: :D\r\nZarte Is Bored: leona\r\nZarte Is Bored: don&#039;t u have anything better to do in ur life than flame players?\r\nZarte Is Bored: if this game is lost for u\r\nZarte Is Bored: go to yt, watch smth\r\nZarte Is Bored: please\r\nZarte Is Bored: yh\r\nZarte Is Bored: proves ur age\r\nZarte Is Bored: it&#039;s 10 right\r\nZarte Is Bored: yy\r\nZarte Is Bored: xin u had 1 job, and that was to make sure i snowball\r\nZarte Is Bored: instead\r\nZarte Is Bored: u farm\r\nZarte Is Bored: and let teemo hit the ball\r\nZarte Is Bored: u all seem to be 12 years old so no point in trying to teach u smth\r\nZarte Is Bored: i had 5 win streak before this, i bet xin had like 8 loss streak, dying to find out after this math\r\nZarte Is Bored: match\r\nZarte Is Bored: i was carried lucian? dude check out my acc and then talk\r\nZarte Is Bored: bad games happen\r\nZarte Is Bored: especially when ur jng doesn&#039;t do anything\r\nZarte Is Bored: i guess someone can rage so much to flame like this only because they don&#039;t have life outside of lol but whatever, wp anyway\r\nZarte Is Bored: zaboli me cosak ba haha, jebes 1 gejm","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Tantram","date":"2016-09-12T22:22:41.561+0000","up_votes":34,"down_votes":5,"body":"Yes, this is unacceptable behavior.

This is literally what Tantram was trying to explain to you. \n\nCorrect on the first part, horrendously incorrect on the second.\n\n1- Permabans have been here since late season 1 , early season 2, yes.\n\n2- Zero-to-permaban, ESPECIALLY FOR \"Toxicity\", are very rare and have not \"Always been here since ever\". They began in late S3 and really started to be applied since S4 when Riot began \"cracking down on toxicity\".\n\n3- Zero-to-permaban are reserved, according to Riot themselves, for the most ultra extreme toxicity fringe cases which mine was not. It was not even close... two different Rioters directly told me that my toxicity was mostly low to moderate and certainly not justifiable zero-to-permaban levels, there is a reason the permaban was later overturned.\n\n> It&#x27;s unrealistic because he still doesn&#x27;t reply to all of them. \n\nAbsolutely irrelevant, earlier you said it was 'unrealistic' which does not follow with what you are saying now, keep moving those goalposts though.\n\nThe level of egregiousness of a case has always been one of the main draws of Riot Tantram's inquiry, mine being at the maximum level should have gotten me aid but it did not, he went out of his way to not assist me and that was very disheartening, as a loyal player for many years I finally realized that Riot didn't care.","replies":[{"poster":"TrulyBland","date":"2016-09-14T20:24:54.043+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And once again, you manage to not adress a single point I made, elegantly misrepresenting them one at a time, and acting as if your definition of things are the only objective truth.\n\n\"Deliberate\" is not an absolute term.

The zero-to-permaban punishment did not occur by accident, it was deliberate.\n\n> since we now seem to suddenly agree that zero-to-permabans are not a violation of protocol in principel\n\nAnd I said zero-to-permaban was a violation of protocol when.....? your strawman argument is noted and dismissed.\n\n> Also, I have yet to see the Rioters explaining to you that your toxicity was &quot;mostly low to moderate&quot;.\n\nThen perhaps you should look into it, my thread was at the top of the list for over 10 days with many responses and a copy paste from every interaction I had with Riot members.... including the one that specifically stated that my permaban would be overturned as my behavior did not even come close to qualifying for the ultra rare zero-to-permaban.\n\nIt's not difficult, it's not complicated.\n\n\n>I still doubt it, given taht your permaban was overturned, but a 14-day ban (which is still escalated punishment) was kept in place.\n\nWhich was wrong and a violation of protocol.\n\n> And finally: You claim I&#x27;m moving the goal post, but I&#x27;m not. \n\nExcept you have, multiple times... you use strawman arguments and red herrings to pretend like you are making headway but you're just talking absolute nonsense (Ex: Accusing me of saying that zero-to-permaban cases are automatically wrong rather than me talking about my case specifically, which is what I was doing from the beginning with zero ambiguity).\n\n> And that is still my point. You pointing out that Tantram does these things on a regular basis\n\nDisproves your nonsensical argument and reinforces mine. Yes.\n\n> The egregiousness of your case is neither an objective truth\n\nExcept that it is, I had never even heard of someone being hit with a zero-to-permaban with low to moderate (At most) toxicity. Every single zero-to-permaban case I'd seen was people that were ultra toxic which I was not. There is a reason my case was one of the rare ones that is overturned.\n\n>nor was it even determined at the time.\n\nExcept it was, which is why the punishment-under-false-pretenses was overturned.\n\n>You wanted Tantram to look into it\n\nYes. Finally you understand at least one thing.\n\n> And I&#x27;ll be honest... with your absurd sense of entitlement\n\nDo you even know what a \"sense of entitlement\" is? I highly doubt it.\n\nI have been punished before and even had an account permabanned in S2. I had no need to even make a thread on the forums because I knew exactly why I had gotten banned, I was warned many times that a permaban was coming but I ignored the warnings. The difference then and in this case was that in this case I had nothing remotely resembling what constitutes zero-to-permaban behavior and had not been punished in years.\n\nZero-to-permaban is reserved for the ultra rare fraction of an already small fraction of a percent. The ultra toxic players of which I am not, even by Riot's admission I am only low levels of toxicity on the scale.\n\n>combined with your immense paranoia\n\nEvidence of above quoted where? oh yeah nowhere. Next.\n\n> The world doesn&#x27;t revolve around you.\n\nWhat a nonsensical statement.\n\nLet's clarify;\nBeing in the correct website, in the correct board subsection, with the correct information, requesting a review from the correct person, who does that kind of thing on a regular basis I might add, when my case is ultra-egregious is not \"the world revolves around me\" behavior.\n\nIf I were worthy of such an extreme punishment, I would accept it. I was not, I was mistreated by Riot. This is not debatable. At this juncture I would like to know why they chose to do such a thing to me but I have no illusions or hopes that they will ever answer the question.\n\nIf they refused to aid me when my account was hit with a zero-to-permaban punishment under false pretenses/by what I speculate to be a rogue Rioter that abused his power.... then I doubt they will ever even answer the question. I had great faith in Riot prior to this incident even though I had been permabanned before, but after their atrocious mistreatment of me coupled with giving me the cold shoulder (Radio silence during the debacle) eliminated the faith I previously had.\n\nBetraying a loyal player for no reason is wrong.","replies":[{"poster":"TrulyBland","date":"2016-09-14T21:57:42.712+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">And I said zero-to-permaban was a violation of protocol when.....? your strawman argument is noted and dismissed.\n\nfunny, how I explained where you said that **EXACTLY AFTER THE PORTION YOU QUOTED**.\n\nThe entire answers to questions you ask in this way too long post of yours, are between the very lines you post.\n\nAnd you still claim that words like \"egregious\" are objective.\n\n\nAnd you wonder why Riot doesn't talk to you.

Also. you do realize that dunkey got banned due to consistently poor behavior right? Heck, even Lyte himself commented on it back when he still worked at Riot Games: \n\n>**What do you think about vgdunkey's ban?**\n\n>It's really unfortunate. Many Rioters love Dunkey's content, and I've unloaded my share of \"Not even close babyyyyy\" jokes around the office; however, we really can't show favoritism to someone just because they are a pro or a known content creator. This isn't really a debate about whether trashtalking is OK or not OK in games; we've talked a lot in the past about how we're OK with players bantering with their friends but you should be careful when interacting with strangers who may not understand your intentions--especially if you're using hate speech or slurs. We have a zero tolerance policy against hate speech, racism, homophobia, and sexism and that policy stands whether you're a random player, a pro player, or a Youtube celebrity.\n\n>This also really wasn't a case about intentional feeders and whether it's OK to be toxic towards other toxic players--there wasn't even a Malphite in the game that got him banned and either way, retaliation just isn't OK because it makes the experience worse for everyone else in the game.\n\n>We know that players have been asking us to be more aggressive against intentional feeders for awhile, and it has taken us a bit longer than we'd like. We do consider gameplay toxicity just as serious as verbal toxicity, and are launching a new Intentional Feeder Detection system in 5.18 that can ban feeders within 15 minutes of matches. We're starting with conservative settings to make sure the system would not ban players for having the rare bad game, even if it was a 0-10 type of bad game but this is a great first step to aggressively tackling intentional feeders.\n\n>At the end of the day, this incident sucks for everyone. We respect that Dunkey hasn't posted his Reform Card, and I'm not going to post it either. Best wishes to him in the future.","replies":[{"poster":"ChaoticGodsLOL","date":"2016-09-14T16:53:04.903+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"No, the only way to not be punished by the extremely bullshit system that riot lyte has put into place is to simply play with 3-4 other friends, or never talk in chat.

I've been playing since Snowdown Showdown Season 2 and I often talk quite a bit in my games (usually things gameplay related like \"fizz flash down\" or \"mid mia\" or things of that nature\") and I have never been warned nor banned (and before you say it, no I do not have a group of friends that I play with on a regular basis). How? Because I don't do or say things that I know will get me in trouble.\n\nIf you behave like a jerk who rages at and harasses their teammates when things don't go their way then yes you will be punished. If you behave like a decent human being though and don't rage in the chat or troll via gameplay then you won't have to worry about being punished. If you need to vent then do so at the screen and not in chat.\n\nAgain, you can use chat, you just can't use it to rage and flame at people. If it's not helpful, respectful or constructive then just don't press enter. From [Riot Tantram](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/unobngtr-how-player-behavior-penalties-affect-hextech-crafting?show=rundown): \n\n>Actually, Erdrik is correct here.\n\n>A report flags a game for review. They do not establish guilt. The game is then reviewed for harassment, feeding, etc. This is why 'troll reporting' or 'gang reporting' do not work. False or inaccurate reports are thrown out.\n\n>You cannot ever be punished for saying nothing .. unless of course it's for something gameplay related like feeding, afking or cheating. But, you can never be punished for offensive language, hate speech or verbal abuse if you said nothing.","replies":[{"poster":"ChaoticGodsLOL","date":"2016-09-15T04:02:43.899+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Would like to respond with this.

If it's the former and your friends report you for fun (I've read threads where people claim that they and their friends report each other for fun) then that might be a problem, since the IFS doesn't differentiate between friends and strangers. From [Ulanopo's Knowledge Base](http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=4086541&page=12#post46206108): \n\n>**\"I should not have been banned for bantering with my friends.\"**\n\n>Just as Riot filters out numbers in many cases, they have a program that detects and removes banter between friends. (source (http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?p=27042870#post27042870))\n\n>_This is probably news to most people, but friendly banter is hidden from Tribunal in most cases... so you never see it in a case. This is partially why sometimes in a case file, it might look like there is missing chat or context._\n\nIf it's the latter then if you don't make it known that you're joking then that's the problem. Strangers won't know that you're joking when using that kind of language if you don't make it known that you are joking.\n\nEither way I'm pretty sure that it's not slang that's the problem.
