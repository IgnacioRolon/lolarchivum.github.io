Riot's already gone and nerfed a ton of the damage in the game as is, and Akali's the least bursty assassin in the game.

You really just need to E + Q + Ignite her if she's diving you under turret.

Sometimes it gives enemies chances to run (though it gives MS) and other times it just makes her damage patterns very awkward. The point is it delays her damage.\n\nI wonder what would happen if enemies saw the ring as well, so they can dance to the other side when Akali moves to one.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Vlada Cut","date":"2018-09-10T10:59:20.910+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Assasin's shouldn't have hard cc in their kit, even if it was a micro one it can still mess you up.

In fact that was probably the ONLY reason they put the stun in her ultimate to begin with, so she could outplay Katarina. If Akali needs any kind of nerf it's to her Q. Her passive deals enough damage as it is and once that Q is maxed and she has some AP it deals a ton on it's own.","replies":[{"poster":"Somebody Love Me","date":"2018-09-10T06:30:41.307+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's  kinda her only real damage ability till 6, and considering her already shit waveclear and energy problems, I think her Q is the last thing demanding a nerf.","replies":[{"poster":"VoraciousX","date":"2018-09-11T03:39:56.183+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Actual Trash,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=oWqFQXlU,comment-id=00130000,timestamp=2018-09-10T06:30:41.307+0000)\n>\n> It&#x27;s  kinda her only real damage ability till 6, and considering her already shit waveclear and energy problems, I think her Q is the last thing demanding a nerf.\n\nShe gets bonus minion damage at max rank. They could give her rank scaling bonus minion damage instead to make her waveclear not shit. Late game she can practically Q a whole wave and clear it. That's a lot better than Katarina considering Kat's damage is delayed and ADCs generally mop the floor with your wave before you even have a chance to clear them. Here's a comparison of Akali with just gunblade(no runes or anything) of the damage of her abilities at max rank:\n\nPassive: 272\nQ: 191\nE: 416(both activations) or 196(just hitting the E but not reactivating)\nR:260(first activation)/264(second activation)/524(both activations)\n\nQ doesn't look like much in this sense, but if you think about it Akali's gonna Q you most likely 2 times in the same few seconds. That's gonna put her Q at 382 which is more than her passive(assuming she doesn't use her passive on you both times, which she could, but there could be situations blocking her from doing that, meaning she could proc more damage than her passive by just using her Q in shroud).\n\nTo be fair though after looking at it, E could probably use more of a nerf than Q, but then again Akali doesn't max E because she needs the waveclear so probably not. It does do an awfully high amount of damage rank 1 as well though.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"gabetheguy","date":"2018-09-09T21:16:35.987+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":5,"body":"it's like the shortest CC in the game lmao","replies":[]},{"poster":"DuskDaUmbreon","date":"2018-09-09T18:16:46.705+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"It's a .5 second stun on the first cast.\n\nRiot could remove it, but then to compensate they'd have to reduce the lockout time on the second dash by .5 seconds as well.","replies":[{"poster":"Ryrynounet","date":"2018-09-09T19:16:09.835+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And maybe even more because that micro stun allow akali to instant E after her R1","replies":[]}]}]}
