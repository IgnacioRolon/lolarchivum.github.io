Every single gay, trans, bi, etc person I&#039;ve ever met find it fucking stupid for those SJW&#039;s trying to &quot;defend their right&quot;, even though they never ever ask for them to defend said right. Remember the &quot;Trans people should decide what bathroom they should be allowed to use&quot;? The Trans community never fucking asked for that, it was SJW&#039;s and I remember very clearly that it pissed the trans community off.\r\n\r\nSame thing here, girls in the League community never fucking asked to come to Pax early, and leave the males to come an hour and a half later. It&#039;s the stupid ass SJWs, leave shit alone, because no one asked for this.","replies":[]}
