The fact that not every Jhin player is good enough to take full advantage of this broken interaction doesn't mean its not a broken interaction. If Jhin had a much lower play rate, he would statistically have a much higher win rate, due to the sheer fact that much, MUCH less people would be losing on him. You want to know how I know this? Because even with a winrate that you would consider normal for a champion, complaints about Jhin are spreading like wildfire.\n\n\n> \n> Here&#x27;s something to think about.

Before, it was very rarely one champion warping the game.  But even if it was, you could ban it and the rest of the roster would range from below average to above average. Why? Because the CHAMPION was broken fundamentally. It wasn't a combination of items and runes/masteries, it was the champion itself. Today? You can't find a single damn champion that people call broken that got to that point based on just existing. It's ALWAYS items/runes now. You nerf those broken items but then replace those nerfs with buffs to other items (OR THE SAME DAMN ITEM, DUSKBLADE HELLO?). A good question to ask is, \"when did this game start to revolve around the items you build and not the champion you pick?\" What items ruin the game the worst when you see them built?\" There's always going to be broken items because that's the MO now.","replies":[{"poster":"Kerrigan 4 Prez","date":"2018-09-04T12:16:01.424+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":2,"body":"Dude, I think you need to turn it down a bit.
