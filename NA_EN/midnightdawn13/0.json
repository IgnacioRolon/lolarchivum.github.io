Once I go into the settings in game and set it to the proper resolution I have an overlay glitch where the game does not recognize my mouse location properly. Clicking far away from the pointer, and text is displaced. Furthermore, it refuses to save my settings from in-game, or the config file changes. I quit playing league after four years with the game, three months ago due to this, figuring it would be fixed in a patch, and have since sought to return, but even with updating the problem has not been resolved. I am looking for a \"people's solution\" as this has probably been seen by other people.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-30T16:31:34.533+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Making modifications to your config can result in issues in-game, so it's not a good idea to continue doing that.  Your resolution or monitor may be too high to be supported as well, which can result in the mouse or visual issues you're reporting here.  You'll need to reduce your resolution to 1080 or less, and try not to tab in and out if using a 4K.  I hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
