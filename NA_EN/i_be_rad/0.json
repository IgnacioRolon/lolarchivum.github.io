If a top lane champ KNOWS they can't survive in lane bc they will be dove, and the enemy isn't freezing at tower, they can roam and get back in the game by getting kills ganking, or pushing lanes out on a gank and taking tower, or maybe even just taking dragon or something. If the enemy pushes hard and drops the outer tower early then the top has a chance to let the enemy push to second tower and freeze if their team can keep from getting dove by the fed enemy top, or shove and keep roaming if they can't let the enemy roam. If the enemy stays in lane they have to extend a very long way without a tower to fall back to and jungle or even jungle and mid can gank (say if jungle ganks mid and gets a kill then they both roam). Sometimes abandoning lane to let them take tower can be a tactical advantage if you know how to abuse the lack of laning safety and not get abused bc top can roam or go into your jungle easy.","replies":[{"poster":"darkmatchwaldo","date":"2015-09-20T00:33:35.289+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The sad thing is that some people are literally clueless as to what they can do roaming, they kinda just walk around for a bit.

Early on there are few objectives to control up there save for towers. You go mid/bot and start crushing the other lanes if your jungler isn't/cant come top to counter gank, and then when the enemy toplaner joins the first teamfight you don't die so fast and they get two shot by your adc.\n\nAlso warding deep helps so if you do know the enemy jungler wants to just dive you then you can simply back out and let them take the tower. Yeah it sucks but they lose a lot of map pressure if your team knows they're up there and all they get is a tower and no kills.","replies":[{"poster":"starly135","date":"2015-09-19T21:35:22.487+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are often two problems with this.\n\nFirstly is communication leading to co-operation, it can be very hard to convince team mates that you haven't met before to help you relentlessly roam and apply pressure unconventionally.\n\nSecondly is your own power, as you have already fallen behind you are likely at a level disadvantage to everyone else in the game, your ganking power will be weak and you run a high risk of dying unless assisted by another lane, which ties into the first point.\n\nOvercoming these however will get you back up to speed and avoid a snowball.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"hgjkdlsaf jeldvb","date":"2015-09-19T08:28:48.982+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yes, but Riven is a shit example.

Towers basically don't exist once the enemy has 2 kills on you especially if they're playing any of Riot's most recent favourite children.  I'd like to see you play any mage mid give 2 kills to Diana and lets see how safe you are behind your tower.\n\nyou're relatively safe vs a diana under tower compared to someone like zed or ekko though.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"PanterLily","date":"2015-09-20T14:33:09.851+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im very good at loosing lane in a solo lane, when i support however sometimes depends how good in loosing lane my ADC is, so sometimes Im half as good in bot lane :D\n\nBut depending on the champion I really lack risky plays and I rarely engage in a fight that has 50-50 chance of me wining it, jungling in normal's helped me a bit to resolve this issue to an extent, but I'm still rarely the one that gets a quadra... hell even triple almost never happens.\n\nWhat im trying to say is that this... \"good\" at loosing lane; it depends a lot on the personal play style, players cant stay in the opposite play style for long in a match.\nI have friend that is the opposite of me, he knows how to stall the opposite laners success but he cant stand playing like me longer than 7 min (I actually keep tabs when he is loosing lane), But when he is ahead he wins with multy-kills. I also can charge for about 5 minutes until im killed then I get back to may safe play and waiting on the team.\n\nThe ones who thrive on assists like me can keep the enemy busy even when they loose, so my friend that thrives on death-matches can have time to make his build and stomp them :D .","replies":[]},{"poster":"Noski7","date":"2015-09-20T01:24:47.073+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"your were in my game with the 1/14/1 yi top weren't you","replies":[]},{"poster":"Asayake 5150glow","date":"2015-09-20T01:29:55.285+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"I've got a feeling that Olaf is a little overpowered right now. He can slow lock you, and when you have no escapes, that's huge. Second, you can't duel him, because he attacks faster when he get's lower, to the point of TWO ATTACK SPEED at LEVEL 7 with a Vamp Scepter(?). Third, that also means he's really good at diving, because the turret shots will only make him hit you faster. Ragnorak stops your CC's, and he whacks away at you. Fourth, if you're running away, he can throw his Q at you repeatedly. If he hits, he gets 1-2 auto's off before he reaches his axe again, and then he throws it again. If he misses, he just picks it up and THROWS it _Again_. It's really sad... because landing a single Q let's him stay on top of you...","replies":[]}]}
