Why would a report that the system inspects and rejects have any impact?\n\nActually they do. If you get reported a decent amount, it doesn't matter if they're false. There are many cases which prove this if you search forums... including people playing very non-meta picks getting suspended. No one's reading your chat logs. There's no jury. It's just a simplistic AI and keyword search followed by report agreement and frequency stats.","replies":[{"poster":"Mysticman89","date":"2017-09-04T01:09:45.571+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm honour 5, and on an approximately weekly basis like to go on an off meta adventure supporting as something I do not have a S rank mastery chest for (i.e. the majority of non-supports), until I get my chest.

If there isn't report agreement, it's true that you won't be punished but if there is, you definitely will have it count against you regardless of whether the reports were justified. They do not have an advanced AI system truly understanding context, humor and language (literally no one does so please don't pretend they do when they can barely solve primitive technical problems with their client and engine... they'll ban players for even quoting toxic players when getting offended ex: \"very negative behavior, Mr.Wiggles just called me \"\") and practical play has proven that it's an automated system based on keywords, report frequency and report agreement. Singed support is one such case where the guy was not toxic at all and merely went Singed support with Smite, counterjungled the enemy and then went back bot. He managed to do so maining it in Platinum ELO and still got a suspension till a thread blew up on reddit. There are many such cases if you care to look. They aren't the norm but they prove this is how the system works especially with certain \"evidence\" logs which are complete nonsense and don't even seem toxic. In that case, said player likely was toxic before and thus very close to a punishment threshold so even a game where he wasn't, if some people dislike him, will take him over the edge with false evidence.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Escheton","date":"2017-09-04T00:26:08.109+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you pingspam or otherwise flame/troll via non-verbal methods?","replies":[{"poster":"Rebel 986","date":"2017-09-04T11:14:19.385+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Escheton,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=gimFYzO8,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2017-09-04T00:26:08.109+0000)\n>\n> Do you pingspam or otherwise flame/troll via non-verbal methods?\n\nNope.
