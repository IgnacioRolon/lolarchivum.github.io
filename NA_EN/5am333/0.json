This is my first time doing this and I am glad that you are the one to read it.  This concept will not be comprehensive with stats and all the like, but it was something that I thought and wanted to share with others who appreciate creativity.  So let me know what you think :)\r\n\r\n**Champion** \r\nName:  Negev\r\n\r\nVisuals:  Looks like a blob of sand with small eyes and a big mouth.  Kinda like a brown Muk if you ever played pokemon\r\n\r\nRole:  Support/ Tank\r\n\r\nAuto attack: melee\r\n\r\nDamage type: AP\r\n\r\nResource: Mana\r\n\r\n**Abilities**\r\n\r\n*_Passive:   Sand pools_        \r\n                 \r\n                    After Negev takes (0.20 Hp) damage, he drops a small pool of sand that lasts 180 sec.  Sand pools moderately slow enemies that walk on it.  The sand pool will be destroyed if an enemy champion walks across it.\r\n\r\n* _Q:  Sand bomb _(hits enemies in a circular area of impact, skill shot) (range similar to maokai&#039;s sappling toss)\r\n\r\n                    Negev hurls a piece of himself dealing damage and dropping a sand pool on the target area.  \r\n                    ( Base damage is relatively low with moderate AP scaling )\r\n                    ( Cost is a small percentage of health )\r\n                    ( Cooldown is average)\r\n\r\n* _W:  Sand lock_ ( point and click on sand pool )\r\n\r\n                     Negev causes any enemy that is currently on a target sand pool to be rooted and to take damage.  After the root is finished the sand pool is depleted.  If an enemy walks on the sand pool after the root has been applied, they are only rooted for the remaining amount of time and not the full duration.  If for any other reason the sand pool is depleted then the root ends early.\r\n                    ( Base damage is relatively low with moderate AP scaling )\r\n                    ( Cost is average amount of mana )\r\n                    ( Cooldown is average )\r\n\r\n*_ E: Eruption_ ( point and click on sand pool )\r\n\r\n                     Negev quickly travels underground to a target sand pool and erupts out of it causing damage and knocking up enemies in an area around him.  Negev heals for (0.05 Hp) and depletes the sand pool.\r\n                     ( Base damage is on the higher side for a support tank with a moderate AP scaling )\r\n                     ( Cost is high-ish amount of mana )\r\n                     ( Cooldown is low-ish )\r\n\r\n*_ R: Sand Prison_ ( Self cast )\r\n\r\n                     All sand pools within a very large radius ( large enough to reach from bot lane to dragon ) are called back to Negev and catch all enemy champions on their path back to Negev pulling them into him.  Negev transforms into a prison, which also causes himself and every rooted champion inside of him to be un-targetable and stunned for the duration.  Negev absorbs all sand pool he calls back healing himself for (0.025 Hp) each.\r\n                      ( Base damage is low with a high AP scaling )\r\n                      ( Cost is high amount of mana )\r\n                      ( Cooldown is long )","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2018-11-07T04:21:26.724+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is nearly identical to Zac, in both theme and kit.","replies":[{"poster":"nasu010","date":"2018-11-09T12:47:36.910+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Nope Nope Nope Nope Nope get out of here\n\nNo fight downs \n\nThis is a first time creator and this champ is a WIP.\n we need to encourage creativity NOT SHOOT DOWN WHE.

So this can go through walls and deals extra damage to enemies if they are carried into walls, it roots them if they hit a walk and this lasts until the entire sand wave has gone through the wall.\nE can be another ability, am just giving ideas on how you can develop this concept better \n\nBest of luck brainstorming.

Thank you for your input.  Do you think that it would be more effective if his damage scaled off of AD instead, so that his auto attacks were a strong part of his kit?\n\nAlso, in case I didn't make it clear, I mentioned that his Q leaves a sand pool where it lands and his Q does not have a mana cost, so he should be able to lay out quite a few if he stays in lane a minute or two.  Do you think that that is still not enough to effectively fight?","replies":[{"poster":"NotAPurpleFrog","date":"2018-11-08T19:48:35.514+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=5am333,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=vHNyEEBE,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2018-11-08T19:34:04.132+0000)\n>\n> That&#x27;s a good point.
