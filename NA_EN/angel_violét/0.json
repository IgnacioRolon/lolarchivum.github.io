I just went on a loss streak from plat 2 60 lp down to plat 4 75 lp.  This happened due to me not knowing when to stop playing (like when its 2:00 am and you are tired as balls).  \n\nI say just play ranked and don't even look at your lp post match, just focus on doing well or improving something every game.\n\nidk just my 2 cents.","replies":[{"poster":"Angel Violét","date":"2016-02-29T05:52:52.718+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Often times I play champions who i want to practice, and i don't really \"try hard\".
