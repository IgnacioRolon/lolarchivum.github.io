Restarted the client for an update as usual. Queued up for an aram and noticed all my rune pages are gone (along with my summoners being reverted to the default ghost/heal). I didn't quite manage to throw together the correct page, so I'm glad that it wasn't a ranked game. Check my rune tab in client and yup, all the pages are gone. \r\nAnyone else have a similar problem? Last patch my game was fine.\r\n\r\nSomething else to note is that when I go to add a new rune page it starts with a separate \"choose your tree\" page, before turning into the normal rune selection page. This feels awful imo and I don't remember it doing this every time I wanted a new page, but maybe I just haven't had to make pages from scratch in such a long time.","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-09-22T01:17:27.828+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It also resets your skin selections to default for every champion, resets your party status to open, etc. Moderately common issue and very annoying.","replies":[{"poster":"Cakelynn","date":"2019-09-22T01:35:41.565+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"it seems like I cant properly hide the default rune pages either.
