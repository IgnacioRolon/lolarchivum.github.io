Nothing feels worse than trying to go after a certain champ when other players are just sitting in the circle making it hard to see the champs and getting in the way.

There are people who will actually run around bumping into people as they are trying to pick their champ, just to knock them off.

If this was 'supposed' to be this way, I think it's dumb. Get your pick and get out XD.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Porglit","date":"2019-07-12T13:19:29.677+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They did MASSIVELY reduce your hitbox, so it's a ton harder to disrupt people by bumping.
