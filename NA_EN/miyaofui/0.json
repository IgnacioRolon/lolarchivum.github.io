I was playing on the beta client. Then an error occurred. Checked web page for help. Finally fixed the problem by configuring DNS. League worked just fine. After logging on yesterday morning I couldn't log in.\r\n\r\nI reset basically everything: League, my computer, and the internet router. My internet is just fine. Everything else runs on my computer. I re-installed league and it finally shows me the login screen and gives me this:\r\n\r\n\"Connection Failure: Unable to connect to the PVP.net server.\r\nInformation regarding what may have caused this error can be found here.\r\nService availability can be viewed on the League of Legends Server Status web page\".\r\n\r\nTried Hextech tool and still nothing. I think it has something to do with the beta client.. prior to install I would choose to update to beta but it would never go through. Skipping the beta league began to actually install.. Progress, but no success in the end.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-09T00:38:57.637+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like your connection to our servers overall is *pretty unstable*.
