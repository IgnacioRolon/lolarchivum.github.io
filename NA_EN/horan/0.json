Her dance emote is the only one that produces sound. Tried using her Classic and Firecracker skin and they are all fine.\n\n**[How to Reproduce]** - Start a custom game lobby by yourself and select Mafia Jinx. Once loaded on Summoner&#039;s Rift, she produces no sound. Can also be reproduced on normal games (draft). \n\nAnyone else having this issue or can this be solved by simply repairing the client? Thanks in advance for the help.\n\n*edit - Would also like to add that my allies cannot hear her as well.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-11-03T21:36:45.396+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Juiz,\n\nThanks for the awesome bug report! \n\nWe're aware of the issue and are working to resolve it ASAP!","replies":[{"poster":"Horan","date":"2015-11-03T22:21:59.683+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Whew, I'm glad I wasn't the only one getting the issue.
