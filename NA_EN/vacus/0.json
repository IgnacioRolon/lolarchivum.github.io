Lines were being thrown out from it all over and it was barely recognizable as a model.  Trust me, if you reproduce it, you'll know.\r\n\r\nIt was fixed when I changed stance, and would not reoccur until the next time I died in Bear Stance.  I can't say what would have happened in other stances; I only died while in Bear that game.\r\n\r\nAnother player in the game reported seeing it as well, suggesting it was not unique to my machine.  It's possible he had some setup that included the same parts as mine, however.\r\n\r\nr3d log and dxdiag attached.\r\n\r\nReproduction steps:\r\n1 - Play Primal Udyr.\r\n2 - Enter Bear Stance.\r\n3 - Die.\r\n4 - Respawn.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-01-29T17:46:55.484+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the report!
