Riot just doesn't officially support third party programs not prohibited player to use it if their virtual machine  is capable to play the game, so it would not cause the account be banned, am I right? As you know, lots of computer can run VM and even run faster than some old actual pc. It would be no problem to play it at all.\n\n2. The Virtual machine is a third party program not a bot, so using it is not botting, am I correct?","replies":[{"poster":"bulldoggamer","date":"2017-04-28T17:26:07.421+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You should be correct. VMware wouldn't directly interfere with league. So it would be treated the same as running it on any old machine. I'm not sure if your IP address will change so be wary of that because it could be seen as account sharing. But my guess is that you would be in the clear.","replies":[{"poster":"Raysjdy","date":"2017-04-29T02:05:18.671+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for reply,  but I still need reply from rioter because the only thing I used is vmware but my account get banned and said I used bot.","replies":[{"poster":"Arch4ngeL","date":"2018-02-23T17:11:22.308+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi all,\n\nno one replied to this question?\ni want try to use vmware on mac for play lol on a virtual Windows.
