I create a username for example aabb in one region and AAbb in another region. I find I can use either of my username even use AABB or mix the capital and lower letter to login to the support and game(as long as i choose between these two region I sign up). In the support page, no matter which region I choose, both direct to the same result which I can see these tickets by using one of these two username. Only difference is when I login into client ,in one region I has a summoner and none in another region because I have not create a summoner. \r\n\r\nSo my question are: \r\n1. The username do not tell difference between the capital letter and lower letter? \r\n\r\n2. If in this case, when I want to transfer to one region to another, since I have already create a username aabb, I can not even use AABB or mix letters? But since aabb and AAbb are both mine and use the same email address, can I just use the anyone of these username only transfer summoner and contents? \r\n\r\n3. Does the summoner name tell difference between capital letter and lower letter? For example, I have a summoner called aabb in one region, and AAbb in another region, when I want to transfer from one to another region, can I choose aabb as well even there is a AAbb exist? If not, can I just use AAbb I have but have my summoner's champion and skin etc transfer?","replies":[{"poster":"Raysjdy","date":"2016-11-10T13:58:36.575+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for reply. But it is little bit unfair, because both name are mine, and I just want to transfer the champion and skin. And I notice that I can request to delete username and summoner, hence in my case, if I can not just use that identical name, but I can ask to delete it first then I apply it again, It just take more steps to do the same thing, why could you just let me use the name?\n\nSecond thing is like I said, I find the two username I login can find the same ticket I submitted, it was only submit by one username for one server, how can the other username see it if these two username recorded in different server?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-10T02:34:56.911+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The username is not case sensitive, so capitals do not matter. Additionally, if you have identical usernames across servers (let's say NA and OCE). If you transfer your NA account to OCE, you'll have to pick a new username. Furthermore, if your summoner names were identical as well, you'll also be prompted to select a new *summoner name*.
