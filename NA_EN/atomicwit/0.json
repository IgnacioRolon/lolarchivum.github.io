There'll always be some freelo out there. ;) Though if you want to needlessly rack your mind you could make an analogy to the [efficient-market hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient-market_hypothesis).

So, a burst champion can 100-0 you, but all burst champions could... All continuous damage champions deal the same damage in the same timeframe, etc etc... as it is now.. some burst champions are useless because other burst ones do more dmg in same timeframe... other continuous dmg champsions are better than others because they do more dmg in same timeframe... To balance the game, this would need to be addressed and a champions should be unique because of their OTHER abilities (you have 4...).","replies":[]}]}]}
