For example, if someone says \"ur so bad... bronze 5 trash\" etc., I&#039;ll type something like \"actually, according to our rankings, I&#039;m a better player than you.\" This is factual and logical based on what statistics can be checked and using the only objective method of determining who the better player is. This makes them rage even more and I realize that they don&#039;t like facing the truth but I&#039;m not going to let people abuse me without challenging them when they&#039;re wrong. I get spite reports from players like this all the time just because their BS was deconstructed.\n\nVirtually everything I get reported for is merely in response to toxic behavior. I do admit that I called some kid \"incredibly pathetic\" for afking a ranked game we were winning because he was mad J4 took his cs. However, even here, I think pathetic is an apt description of a person who chooses to sabotage the game for 4 others because he&#039;s mad at 1. \n\nI once was about to mute a toxic player and typed in chat \"muted and reported.\" He then says he&#039;s reporting me for refusing to communicate since I&#039;m muting him.\n\nOther times, I go non-meta picks and the raging team types stuff like \"report x for trolling.\" It&#039;s not even an actual report category and champion choice isn&#039;t reportable according to ToS so sometimes they just report a random category in that case. \n\nMy point is, the system doesn&#039;t care very much if reports are valid or not. It just tallies the reports and then punishes you. No one is actually reading anything and verifying the reports aren&#039;t complete BS. It wouldn't even be feasible for Riot considering they have tens of millions playing online every month. This is why the system needs to be changed to check the validity of reports and/or punish those who make false reports. If you&#039;re the kind of person that fights back against toxicity (even without calling someone else an idiot, terrible, etc.) but just using logical arguments, you&#039;ll get punished as well. It makes no sense and seems incredibly stupid/flawed.","replies":[{"poster":"Handsome Jhin","date":"2015-04-29T01:36:49.268+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":1,"body":"Honestly, the easiest thing to do is mute them without responding (and usually not even telling them you're going to mute them).

Their report power is nearly intact if they only make blatantly false reports occasionally (perhaps only out of spite). \n\nThere is no system verifying the accuracy of the reports, it's just whether there is statistical agreement. We could all agree you're a witch but that doesn't make it true. You should see how some toxic duos treat reporting. \n\nMoreover, I think there's a bigger problem with people making false reports than not reporting enough. I see report requests almost every other game when someone does really badly in a game. It's usually \"report X feeding/trolling\" even when they are clearly trying and not dying on purpose. Sometimes I see those report requests for non-meta picks even when the player performs adequately. Poor champion choice isn't a report category but that doesn't stop people.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CATS OF THE RIFT","date":"2015-04-30T02:43:39.787+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was under the impression that the tribunal watches the games and gets an overview of everything going on in the game, that way they don't falsely ban anyone (unless you AFK, then you automatically get banned temporarily and placed in a low priority queue).","replies":[{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2015-04-30T03:02:20.700+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's how the tribunal usually works, but it's out of commission until they can fix it (don't expect it to be fixed anytime soon, it's been down for a while.)\n\nNow, it's automated for chat bans (you get a certain amount of good reports, you get chat punishments)  but bans (both temp and perm) are overseen by Rioters.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"atomicwit","date":"2015-06-16T21:17:19.812+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"After many demands for chat logs upon my chat restriction, I've gotten a response.

For example \"you fed him almost as much\" is clearly a response to someone accusing another player of feeding an enemy carry. \"probabyl some loser teengage kid so not worth wasting time on... just trying to make himself feel important by talking sht... pathetic really\" is a response to a player harassing our whole team, intentionally feeding and later afking.  Note, I did not even call him a loser but merely stated a likelihood based on observed behavior so that the team stops focusing on him and plays the game instead. And yes, I stand by calling this sort of behavior pathetic. It is an opinion with a firm foundation. \"3 troll promo games ina row\" is a reaction to getting DCs or incredibly one-sided games. \"you dare to talk?\" is a response to a player harassing our team after being DC for 10 minutes.\n\nThese are either factual statements or opinions. There is nothing inherently toxic in any of these statements unless Riot believes thought control is a good thing and that I am not allowed to express opinions. It's not even retaliation. Retaliation would be akin to person A stating: you're an idiot and then me responding \"you're a dipshit\" etc. I guarantee I've been called an idiot many times in those chat logs and yet at no point, did I respond likewise. A lot of this is merely describing reality and explaining my course of action. For example:\n\n[13:01] Me: if she says anything of value, tell me \n[13:04] Me: otherwise, i keep her muted \n[13:06] Me: pure cancer\n\nA player is harassing me and I'm asking the team to relay any potentially useful information.

I would only type any of that if I'm harassed and if it's objectively true. If someone says \"u suck, noob adc, go back to Bronze 5\" then yeah I'll say \"muted and reported.\" That's exactly what they deserve. I don't mind advice or even players being unhappy with my performance but it can be written in a less antagonistic way. \n\nLikewise, if that player who keeps telling me I suck all game is ranked worse, I will point that out because he's being a hypocrite and everyone has bad games sometimes. This is simply keeping people in check and grounding the situation in reality. I would hope someone would do the same to me if I let my ego get out of line. Although, I don't think I'm a great player anyway.\n\nPerhaps my comments are unnecessary but they are also not harassment and I don't think LoL is Soviet Russia. I'm allowed to express an opinion. If someone's comments are condescending and antagonistic to the extreme, I feel no qualms about exposing contrary facts. \n\nHowever, I will never go out of my way to point someone's lower ranking out etc. if they do not harass me. Thus, if I sound like a dick, it's only because someone else is being a dick to me. Moreover, I never cross the line to the point of violating ToS even though I get reported by said player. Responding to \"u suck\" with \"you're actually ranked worse than me\" might be annoying but it is not against ToS.\n\nBTW: Many people don't actually report when they say they'll report you. I sometimes don't either if a player stopped being a jerk or if I simply forget. Make no mistake though, the punishments are indeed automatic.

He continues with stuff like \"that's cause ur bad, just admit it\" and blames me constantly. You can miss an ability or it can be dodged - 2 ways of looking at it. After the game, he asks for reports on \"negative attitude\" since I'm not \"taking responsibility.\" Basically, he wants me to admit that I suck (and I'm sure I do compared to high ELO players but Jinx ults. aren't the main reason for it). I don't see how not admitting/disagreeing you played something badly falls under negative attitude but apparently it does. This kind of stuff happens way too much.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Çhåryzård","date":"2016-12-10T16:47:38.744+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I thought, at least in certain categories of reports, the system looks for certain words that were used in chat.\n\n\nSo like if someone decides to report you for harassment and you never spoke to them all game, the system doesn't find you using any words considered toxic and throws out the report.\n\n\nIdk","replies":[]},{"poster":"Galgigrin","date":"2016-12-10T16:43:29.502+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can someone tell me that what to do when my internet connection broke for some reason and afterward I log-in but some player has reported about me, that I left the game in middle and I get penalty for that how to tell Riot that it was not my fault ? and remove the penalty ?","replies":[]},{"poster":"seriesido","date":"2016-07-30T18:27:13.740+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:202}} {{champion:202}} {{champion:202}} {{champion:202}} {{champion:202}} {{champion:202}} {{champion:202}} {{champion:202}} {{champion:202}} {{champion:202}} {{champion:202}} {{champion:202}} {{champion:202}} {{champion:202}} {{champion:202}} {{champion:202}} {{champion:202}} {{champion:202}} {{champion:202}} {{champion:202}} {{champion:202}} {{champion:202}} {{champion:202}} {{champion:202}} {{champion:202}} {{champion:202}} {{champion:202}} {{champion:202}} {{champion:202}} {{champion:202}} {{champion:202}} {{champion:202}} {{champion:202}} {{champion:202}} {{champion:202}} {{champion:202}} {{champion:202}} {{champion:202}} {{champion:202}} {{champion:202}} {{champion:202}} {{champion:202}} {{champion:202}} {{champion:202}} {{champion:202}} {{champion:202}} {{champion:202}} {{champion:202}} {{champion:202}} {{champion:202}} {{champion:202}} {{champion:202}} {{champion:202}} {{champion:202}} {{champion:202}} {{champion:202}} {{champion:202}} {{champion:202}} {{champion:202}} {{champion:202}} {{champion:202}} {{champion:202}} {{champion:202}} {{champion:202}} {{champion:202}} {{champion:202}} {{champion:202}} {{champion:202}} {{champion:202}} {{champion:202}} {{champion:202}} {{champion:202}} {{champion:202}} {{champion:202}} {{champion:202}} {{champion:202}} {{champion:202}} {{champion:202}} {{champion:202}} {{champion:202}} {{champion:202}} {{champion:202}} {{champion:202}} {{champion:202}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"OVCO","date":"2015-12-02T19:33:05.526+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had a game which we lost but i have said only one thing and it was not offence :O and after the game BAM reported for saying bad words :O","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonSunleaf","date":"2015-10-28T16:54:00.196+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah but how i deal with people that keeps reporting you for \"bad build\".

What do they think that they can achieve at winning or losing. NOTHING. Is just a game to get relax and stuff. If your so great go to rank and play there. I rarely go rank for the reason of meeting crybabies, sure you can mute them, but the point of this game is to strategies with your team to play.
