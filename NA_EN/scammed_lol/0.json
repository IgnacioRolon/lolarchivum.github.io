But the fact that it makes it take longer to get back into a game because I can't use a quick exit seems dumb. I have a couple examples.\n\nFirst bug I get frequently is the really tiny LoL window after a game ends. Instead of a full resolution window, it becomes like this tiny box with no Minimize-Maximize-Exit buttons. If I press Alt+F4, I can see a little thing pop up that says \"Are you sure y...\" but I can't see the whole thing or click on anything. This needs me to close the game from Task Manager and relog. This bug isn't that bad, since it's not keeping me from a game I'm already in, but it's still very annoying.\n\nThe second one I've gotten fewer times, but it has a much more severe impact. The good ol' black loading screen where you wait for 15 seconds cuz you're not sure if the game is just slow to load or what, but it's unresponsive so you try to quit and reconnect. But I can't Alt+Tab, I can't Alt+F4, I can't do anything to get out of the black screen. If I could Alt+F4, I could just open League, relog, and reconnect and it'd take maybe 15 seconds and I could still make it before the game starts. But instead, I become basically unable to use my computer since I can't change windows and I can't exit the game with a simple key combo. So now I have to hard shutdown the computer, wait for windows to boot, do all this shit that ends up basically ruining the rest of the game because I get there so late. Not only that, because it was a black screen for me and the client/game were technically running, I never actually counted as DC for the game and my team couldn't remake (even though I hard shutdown my computer and I had never been able to buy items or leave base). So that doesn't make any sense either.\n\nRagers are gonna rage, quitters are gonna quit. Why does it have to be harder for me to rejoin a game in which I actually want to try? Why do you need to override basic computer functions just to uphold some ideal that people will work around anyway if they're angry enough?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-18T21:59:38.061+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That happens when you alt+f4 sometimes because you're forcibly telling your pc to halt that process and end it out of nowhere. If it's in the middle of loading game files, it's going to have some hang-ups and this will happen for almost any process intensive program. If you need to back out in a hurry, it's best to try exiting the normal ways.","replies":[]}]}
