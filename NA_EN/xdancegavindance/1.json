Garbage ass jungler... take another cs im done. Sick of people talking shit but then muting me when I say something back? So they end the arguement and you get upset about that? Like, why do you want it to continue? You should be the one muting in thefirst place when they start it. Riot bans people who start it, AND retaliate. So just mute. Retaliation is literally pointless, unless you WANT to get punished.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-01-18T06:11:51.900+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You did nothing except flame all game.\n\nToxic is toxic, regardless of if you be passive-aggressive about it.","replies":[{"poster":"xDanceGavinDance","date":"2019-01-18T06:13:34.735+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"You did not see what was being said in chat. with just my log it seems like i was toxic as hell.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-01-18T06:16:54.849+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"What was said in chat is irrelevant, this is not a grade curve where you get a free pass just because someone else was breaking records.\n\nYou cant beat stupid by hitting it with more stupid, the only answer is ignoring it and hoping it wont tilt harder.","replies":[{"poster":"xDanceGavinDance","date":"2019-01-18T06:19:39.308+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i dont mean that what they said  justifies what i did, what most of what i said would make sense and not look toxic.

As Telephone Booth and i Sona i said, the instant feedback system (IFS) is inconsistent and more often than not won't give you any kind of registered-punishment message.","replies":[{"poster":"xDanceGavinDance","date":"2019-01-18T06:14:45.801+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ok thanks for the help.","replies":[]}]}]}
