The skin was probably the weakest of all of Sona&#039;s skins, even behind Muse, and did not live up to the amazing splash art. While the art looked totally great and made our sweet Maven into a badass-looking rocker girl, once in game all you got was Sona in a black dress with some red... thing slapped onto her head.\r\n\r\nBut now they&#039;ve given her hair proper texture and even lengthened it to match her splash. Her dress was given some details and the color change imo is minor and completely fine. Even her face was made prettier, and most players will never even see it!\r\n\r\nSome people will complain about the lack of different musical cues to her spells, how the non-metal music sounds out of place on her and... well, yeah I get that, but honestly visually she looks so great I really don&#039;t even care!\r\n\r\nNot to mention how pleasantly surprised I was to recall as her ingame and see that they gave her a different recall animation than her other skins. Since the mass recall update, using other animations, I almost felt left out as a Sona player, since none of her idle animations are very noticeable at all and so it barely felt any different. However, not only does she use a different animation, she uses FIVE! And they all flow into each other really cooly, and it just adds another layer of enjoyment to the skin now.\r\n\r\nThis skin has gone from being &quot;the one I really like and want to use but it just feels so underwhelming in game&quot; to my second favorite of all of her skins after Sweetheart. I love it that much. (I was never an Arcade or DJ fan, personally. Her other skins need love, too!)\r\n\r\nSo thank you again, Riot, so much for this little update, from a Silver 1 Sona OTP\r\n\r\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2017-08-16T18:49:40.037+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello, hello! \n\nA sincere thank you from the skins team!  <3\n\nWe know change isn't always easy, especially when you've become attached to a particular skin. A lot of older content has been, and continues to be updated to be brought up to the standards of our current art style, which is overall, great for the game, but there does become the fear of change, and understandably so. \n\nIt's great to hear that Pentakill Sona's changes have bumped her up on your skin tier list. *(Even though it's wrong 'cause Arcade is best skin. ;D)* \n\nSeriously, though, thank you for the kind feedback, and we encourage you to keep giving us feedback - both positive and negative - when new content comes out! \n\nhttp://imgur.com/zhozEXB","replies":[{"poster":"Poolparty Sauron","date":"2017-08-16T18:53:49.511+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since skin updates are brought up any plans for Dragonslayer J4 as it is lackluster compared to all the other DS skins.\nKatey pls ;-;\n(edit) also vayne ;-;","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2017-08-16T19:16:17.070+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"There isn't, no.
