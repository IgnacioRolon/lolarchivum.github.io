They&#039;re both her highest tier skins ~~and are more fanservicey than her others~~ so they tend to draw the most attention.\r\n\r\nHowever, what about the less expensive skins? Some of us surely enjoy these lower tier skins more than the higher tier, right?\r\n\r\nMyself, I vastly prefer Sweetheart and Pentakill Sona to Arcade or DJ, and I do realize they aren&#039;t as impressive, but it&#039;s a purely opinionated thing.\r\n\r\nSo what are some lower tier skins that hold a soft spot in your heart?","replies":[]}
