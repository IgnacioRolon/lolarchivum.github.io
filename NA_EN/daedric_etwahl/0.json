I&#039;m posting it here because it seems like a bug since it doesn&#039;t always happen.\r\n\r\nWhen a shield wears off, it flashes red when it disappears. This makes it look like you&#039;re taking damage from something, and it feels really bad to see and for a moment wonder what&#039;s hitting you when nothing actually is.\r\n\r\nThe strange thing is this only happens SOMETIMES. Judging from my attempts to replicate it both in Training and in a custom where the shields simply disappeared when wearing off like normal, this only seems to occur with larger shields, and it has happened in several games, but only later on in them when my shield value gets bigger.","replies":[{"poster":"Ququroon","date":"2017-12-07T19:43:55.174+0000","up_votes":44,"down_votes":1,"body":"Known issue; redeploy should be going out later today for it. :D\n\nThe repro is to have it expire while you're already damaged, it just looks worse with bigger shields.\n\nEdit: The fix for this is now live.","replies":[{"poster":"DeadUnborn","date":"2017-12-08T02:35:03.621+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"is there a key or document were we can check what all the new symbols mean?
