For your specific issue, your ISP might be taking the scenic route (or the long way) to the game server, and may need to change the route the connection goes through.\n\nGet a [traceroute](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752674-Network-System-and-League-of-Legends-Logs#wq2) and submit a ticket to our [Player Support Team](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) who will be able to help you out.","replies":[]},{"poster":"precambria","date":"2016-07-06T22:58:41.568+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm in Toronto and in the same timeframe my connection to riot servers has been unstable, while my normal average is 27 (which is a dream to play with) it has begun to spike to 200+ and while it corrects pretty fast it just goes up and down like that making the game pretty much unplayable. Everytime I see yet another post about this I throw my hat in the ring in hopes that there will be a real answer as to why, support is great if you make a ticket and I appreciate their help but the solution never lasts or is not a real solution because the problem is not with my connection I can ping to pretty much any other IP and get consistent results.\n If your connection is slower than before and is stable it is probably just going to stay that way, sorry be to the bringer of bad news but that happened to me and it only improved when the server moved to allow east coast to participate in LoL on the same level. my old 37 ping turned into a unsteady 90-120 which is basically a huge handicap you can't really play ranked. I would go through the Knowledge base though and see if the connection troubleshooter can bring you back into playable range there is a lot of good stuff there it is a long list but if you make it through without having some impact I would be amazed.","replies":[]},{"poster":"fewerbog","date":"2016-07-06T17:55:53.175+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Having the same problem","replies":[{"poster":"Medúsa","date":"2016-07-06T17:57:31.262+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=fewerbog,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=XvKfEkEh,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-07-06T17:55:53.175+0000)\n>\n> Having the same problem\n\nthey must use several servers, and i must be getting placed on the ones far away, wish it would stop. the past 8 months ive had no problem and loved the 67-72 ping, literally right after the switch i went to gold, now im on a 98 and find missing a lot of cs, and delays on my lucian missing double shots cause the ping dont keep up with my speed -_-","replies":[{"poster":"fewerbog","date":"2016-07-06T18:00:31.735+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im having almost the exact issue but im having a problem with loading screen, I crash in the loading screen making have to restart my client and reconnect I get in about 1:30 but its starting to get super annoying Iv had around 60-80 ping but now its 100-400 and at worst its goes to 5000 and I disconnect","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Voidac","date":"2016-07-07T00:23:59.216+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I wish people would stop blaming the servers for their shitty internet connection/PCs.","replies":[]}]}
