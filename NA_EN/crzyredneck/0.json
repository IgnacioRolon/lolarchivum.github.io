League did not patch and pulled files as well as preferences (login info) from somewhere from the previous OS. Was wondering if anyone has ever encountered this or if anyone has any ideas of where exactly league is pulling files. It may not be related but it seems to load much slower now that its pulling files from some unknown locale. Please help if at all possible!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-03T16:48:28.372+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I haven't heard of this happening before, so I'm not really sure.  Download our [hextech repair tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367) to help fix up these game files though, by performing a clean reinstall and restoring your game to a fresh state.  Hopefully, that will do the trick!","replies":[]}]}
