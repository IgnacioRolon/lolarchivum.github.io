I am not saying Riot handled this situation well by blocking off as much time as they did for other, paying PAX goers, but they have every right to meet with members of their player-base who they feel are not being treated well and excluding other players. Looking at members of Riot staff who act idiotically is NOT an excuse for you to act the same way, nor is it a justification for you to act toxic in games. Two wrongs don&#039;t make a right. While, Riot is making mistakes, they are trying to do right by the player-base because we are responsible for putting food on the table for them. This is their first BIG screw up since I started playing (around the end of S2). \n\nAll I see on the boards is a lot of talk, but not a lot of walk. Some of you are claiming to be vehemently upset with Riot for what they have done at PAX, but here you are... on your &quot;n&quot;th game of the day. \n\nI&#039;m not looking to argue and I realize I will be downvoted, but just curious to find out more about the specifics of why people are as upset as they are. Must be more than just the PAX issue.","replies":[]}
