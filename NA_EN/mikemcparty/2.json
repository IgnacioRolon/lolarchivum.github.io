I would love to hear any responses. Riot released a statement basically saying that, as a support, one of your jobs is to purchase a sightstone and ward for you team. Understandably, people got upset about this.\r\n\r\nSo here is the conflict. Supports are getting upset that Riot is saying they need to take up an item slot and build sightstone because one of the jobs of a support is to provide vision. I would like to compare this statement to other roles/champions and talk about items that are considered as &quot;must buys.&quot; Support job is to provide vision and support for team.\r\n\r\nIf you are a jungle, you are forced to take smite and forced to purchase a jungle item. That one is clearly obvious, but we never see junglers complain about this. One of the jobs of a jungler is to clear the jungle and provide map pressure. Jungle items help to accomplish that role. Jungler job is to provide pressure.\r\n\r\nFor a mid-lane, I&#039;ll use Diana as an example, since she is my most played mid/champ. When I play Diana, my job is to either provide sustained damage or to nuke squishies. Depending on my match-up, I need to buy {{item:3100}} or {{item:3115}} . Looking at all recommended guides, one of those two items is a must-buy. You never see Diana players complain. Our job is to do damage. \r\n\r\nI don&#039;t want to talk about top lane, since there is A LOT of variability in that role. From what I have noticed, the people playing top, usually have a lot of versatility in the role. I usually play swain top, but I&#039;ll play kennen, gnar, diana, kassadin, etc. (just depends on the niche I need to fill)\r\n\r\nLastly, let&#039;s talk about ADC. Depending on which ADC you play, you have certain items you are locked into buying. ADCs have very little diversity in the items they buy because they ALWAYS build damage, even when behind. Their job is to build damage.\r\n\r\nSo let me get back to the point of the post. Riot told this guy that supports should always be buying one of the sightstone variants and people absolutely flipped. Every day, we ignore the items that are considered must-buys for different roles and champions? That doesn&#039;t make sense to me and is actually pretty aggravating. \r\n\r\nAny thoughts? Interested to hear from supports on this or anyone else who can speak about their experience with &quot;must-buy&quot; items in certain roles?","replies":[{"poster":"MarshCreature","date":"2016-11-18T17:26:25.446+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"the main problem was't him just not buying a sight stone it was the fast he picked support went into the enemy jungle and sacrificed his adc for his selfish play style ,combine that with the fact he did not provide any vision no sight stone no wards just selfishly went to the jungle then went to gank top or mid while the adc gets killed and feeds becoming useless very early in the match he was imposing his play style in people that did not want to play with that selfish way of playing singed. a singed support has one job slow and flip people not to go into the jungle and abandon the lane like a bard would at least the bard has it in his utility kit and play style.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Teridax68","date":"2016-11-19T00:25:57.155+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The thing is, Lich Bane/Nashor's Tooth for Diana at the very least has a bit more variety, and either item a \"must-buy\" because it fits her kit. Smite on junglers is mandatory and not necessarily related to their kit, but it is helpful in that it unlocks items specifically for them. On top of that, Smite is direct power, and the control it provides over contested jungle objectives can feel really fun. By contrast, Sightstone offers nothing that directly benefits the support, it's just something they pick because that's what their team expects them to pick. On top of that, its unique effect is now near-identical to that of a trinket, i.e. a free item everyone can equip that does not take up an inventory slot over other \"real\" items. Wards generally have a hard time conveying how powerful they are, but it also doesn't feel great to give up an item slot and precious early gold for an effect everyone can get for free.\n\nBecause of that, I also think the poll question is poorly phrased: as long as Sightstone exists in the game, supports will be required to pick it, because the moment one champion can itemize for vision more than the other, the burden automatically falls upon the support to equip that item and become the team's ward mule. It is also what forces supports back so hard on both gold and experience, because they're expected to spend more time than anyone else to ward and counter-ward alone, despite supports being the least independent class in the game. \n\nBecause of this, I think the game, and supports especially, would be better off if Sightstone were removed. Wards are no longer purchaseable, so it would be impossible to force them to buy more vision than anyone else, which means nobody would have any excuse to ward less than anyone else. If teams end up with too little vision, one possible solution would just be to buff trinkets to match up to that loss.","replies":[{"poster":"mikemcparty","date":"2016-11-19T15:30:39.069+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think sightstone nor its upgrades offer something that everyone gets for free. The value is the fact that you get to have three wards out at a time. By yourself, you essentially match the ward count of everyone else on your team combined. I like your idea of removing sightstone completely and making it dependent on players to ward. It would definitely increase aggression of junglers and decrease the frequency of large team fights though.

If you are required to buy sightstone the next question is when you are required to have it by, because it is no longer up to you whether or not you get it.\n\nJunglers can put off their item for as long as they see fit.  Mid and top laners can build whatever it is they feel is best for the given situation.  ADCs just kind of do whatever ADCs do.  Supports, however, are forced to buy sightstone as early as possible.\n\nIt's not that sightstone is bad for supports, it's the thought of it being something you HAVE to get.  Should the situation arise where a different item would be better you should be allowed to get that, which can put off your purchase of sightstone.

Riot released a statement basically saying that, as a support,\n\nRiot did not say supports buy sight-stone. They said they acknowledge supports are expected by non support players (not by riot) to purchase sight-stone, and they believe the choice of delaying or outright not purchasing the sight stone is a legitimate game-play choice. \n\nYou have taken their acknowledgement and blown it out of proportion and (falsely) you claim it means riot is officially saying supports must purchase sight stone or 2 week suspension. \n\n>  2. Support job is to provide vision and support for team\n\nhow do you know? That is not necessarily the optimal path. In fact, I am more and more convinced lately that marksmen should be getting the Sight-Stone, and also leave all the farm alone and let the Zyra or Brand gobble it all up while they scale off passive gold and provide vision and utility while they are weak. \n\nIf we look at typical end game stats for Brand and Zyra, we see a lot of damage output. More than your diana. Since it is your job, as a mid lane, to provide control of the map in the mid game, and you have more opportunity to roam and more capacity to 1v1 opponents if you are caught, it stands to reason to have the responsibility of team vision to be for the mid laner. \n\nWhat I am trying to say is this. What we have now is a \"meta\" which has developed organically. It has developed in some part because it is \"statistically\" optimal, but also because of a lot of stagnation, it stays the same even when it is shown it should change. the stagnation is caused by selfish players trying to throw \"un-fun\" tasks in game like warding onto others, or are just fixated on their way of playing.\n\nFor instance for about a year and a half the \"optimal\" play style was to organize a lane swap and to 3v1 the enemy first tower, and from the other side of the map have the top laner accompany the jungler and steal half the junlge XP. That was the optimal competitive play - y did we not see this in soloQ? because players are too stagnant and need their \"comfort zone\" and cant deal with different strategies even when they are shown time and again to be outright better, when they require first coordination but more important than that self sacrifice.\n\n> 2. Our job is to do damage. \n\nFrom looking at a small sample of Zyra supports. We examine the stats of  its quite obvious that Zyra's job is to do damage. In fact since Zyra support is capable easily to out damage the mid laner, purchasing an item that provides neither damage not opportunity to deal damage is a waste, on her. \n\nActually, it really is a waste on her, considering she can out-damage the typical mid lane by a LOT if she is on equal farm. \n\nWhereas a lane champion like Aurelian Sol can easily start off by rushing a Banshee's veil or some other tank item and focus on map control using a sight stone. \n\nThe specific function and responsibilities you have in game should be determined by the circumstances of the specific game, not just by what button you clicked when you queued. I understand you want your role to be \"to jump on an ADC and kill him\" - that is a fun responsibility whereas \"to take a detour into the enemy blue and drop a ward on it\" is less so, but the sight stone should be purchased by the champion most suitable for using it and least hindered from purchasing it. \n\nI am really not certain that in today's meta that champion is always the support. If it is not, the play style that puts that burden on other players should be open for exploration, not shut down by \"I dont want to get it and the support is not getting it, RIOT please fix this piece of shit support player with a ban hammer and also get the economy of the roles proper so that the zyra is incentivized to be the one getting it\". \n\n> If you are a jungle, you are forced to take smite and forced to purchase a jungle item.\n\nyes but you should learn your history before you talk about machete. Also, it upgrades into a ward item so why are all the junglers getting challenging smite? \n\nThe jungle item is designed to do two things: to keep jungler's PVP power low at the super early game (the jungle used to provide more XP and gold in the really early game, leading to junglers entering your lane in levels 2-3 and just 1v1ing you, and also at level 6 doing the same with some cheapo items), and to keep laners from poaching (junglers after level 9 would find most of their jungle taken by their team and would fall off really hard because of that).\n\nWithout machete we have two problems in the jungle: Lee-sin and similar junglers just fuck the lanes up early game with very little counterplay due to level / item advantage (and the fact that they have good early game), and carry type jungler being non-viable due to problem with getting items on time past 1 and a half items (because your mid takes your chickens, your bot takes your krugs and your top helps himself to the wolves and gromp) .\n\nThe whole \"forced into smite\" thing - its just something that accompanies the machete thing. Junglers actually need that \"meta coercion\" to keep the role from overlapping with the \"non farming\" role too much. Otherwise laners will actually get machete and start poaching. \n\n>  When I play Diana, my job is to either provide sustained damage or to nuke squishies\n\nI disagree. As a mid lane, your job is to provide control over the center of the map and give your jungler a fist to shove up the other team's behind. Whether this is best done with damage items, tank items or a sight-stone is up for debate. \n\n> So let me get back to the point of the post. Riot told this guy that supports should always be buying one of the sightstone variants and people absolutely flipped. \n\nPeople flipped because of people like you not because riot said anything about sight stone. People don't like coercion from team mates and fellow players. When they hear that people like you have a problem understanding simple texts from riot and are going to go on with your attempts at securing riot's support in play-style coercion, they get mad at you guys.\n\nbecause you are out of line. \n\n> who can speak about their experience with \"must-buy\" items in certain roles?\n\nLets say I am playing Support Trundle. Or you are playing Support Diana. What is the justification for having the sight stone on us? From a champion power fantasy aspect, there is no justification. \n\nIf we say our champions are supposed to kill shit, regardless of role, than to do our jobs as players of those champions we should be buying items that have good synergy with our champion's core identity. As trundle I want the most tankyness {{item:3143}} and the most AA damage {{item:3748}}  -  not some half baked not that tanky item that sets me with my limited income behind. Same with your support Diana. \n\nThis leaves \"role\" as the only justification for getting the sight stone on the support. The argument that \"the support is the one expected to do it\" is not good - because we want to win and to do the best thing for winning not the best thing for our team's happiness and satisfaction.\n\nTherefore maybe sight stone is better on another champion? is it possible? if you can't prove that it is always in all cases better on the support, than the option of not getting it should be open for the support player to take. \n\nand yes, if the support decides to go full damage and not ward, it maybe means the job of warding is Diana's.","replies":[{"poster":"mikemcparty","date":"2016-11-18T19:43:41.934+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Right, I am saying that each lane has some type of role and this has been defined by the meta.

Not sure I am correct in purchasing it. The more i think about it, i come to the belief that mid should be the one purchasing SS, whereas the support should rush combat stats. \n\nActually, let's suppose I am correct and support should rush combat stats and mid lane should get SS because it is an important item to have in a team. How do i get mid lane to understand that in the context of the game? \n\nthey will go \"my job is damage, your job is SS, buy it or report\". \n\nwhich is essentially your position. \n\n> I don't think the intention of FQC is to be a solo lane item.\n\nIt does not matter what the \"intention\" of FQC or any other item is.

You clearly are having difficulty understanding that certain roles support the team in different ways. One of the ways in which a support provides support for the team is through the purchase of vision-based items and items that provide additional actives and cc effects. My experience playing the game for the last 5 years has shown me that holds true pretty consistently across all elos.\n\nI don't know if you are being sarcastic or if you actually don't have any idea what you are talking about, so I am trying to remain patient. Riot doesn't need to enforce an item purchase if they target the item at a specific role. You won't see anyone going out and buying {{item:1408}} as a mid laner. They don't normally take smite and the stats that item offers don't benefit a normal mid lane champion. Riot doesn't explicitly say, you can't purchase that item, mainly because they don't think that their playerbase is a bunch of idiots.\n\nClearly, you have not been paying attention. My stance is that support is a role that people play knowing that they will be providing vision for their team in combination with the vision provided by their fellow teammates. Knowing this, if you don't want to provide vision and to have that be one of your \"roles,\" then don't play support. Instead, play a role where it is acceptable to build damage and offer no other utility, like adc. When I play support, I know I will be warding, healing, providing utility, and soaking up some damage. Because of this, I build accordingly and you will see sightstone in my item list. If I'm playing top against, I will build according to the situation. Since you don't actually practice what you are clearly trying to preach here, I don't think we need to continue the conversation. You have no experience of playing support without attempting to build sightstone (according to your match history). When you have played a few games building exclusively damage and having your midlane build sightstone, then come back and we can continue the conversation. \n\nGood luck out there, buddy!","replies":[{"poster":"Aptest","date":"2016-11-21T08:26:11.208+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alright. Let's take the discussion a step back and look at the big picture. \n\nYou wanted to ask a question: are there items that champions in specific roles \"must\" buy. Does the jungler \"have to\" go with smite, must the support go with sight stone, must the mid lane have a deathcap. \n\nConsidering a death cap is a natural purchase for anyone who wants to bring damage to the table, and smite is a natural purchase for someone who wants to bring dragon and baron control to the table, and sight stone is a natural purchase for someone who wants to bring vision control to the table, the actual question is this: \n\nShould the role of mid lane be locked into dealing damage? or is this open for discussion and experimentation? Is the role of the jungler absolutely to control baron and dragon, or is the jungler allowed to choose a different function? Does the team actually need a \"vision control specialist\"? if so, should this specialist be the support?   \n\nLet's talk not about support for a moment just to distance ourselves from the hot iron and discuss a different example: \"need a tank\" (I'm sure you heard this one before).\n\nIs it absolutely accepted that all teams need a tank? Given that the support makes for a poor tank (lacks gold), is it acceptable to select 4 damage dealers and then ask the support to be the tank? Must someone else also be a tank? is it absolutely a given that the mid lane is not ever going to be the tank? \n\nCan you go into queue as a mid, having decided in advance that you will not be the team's tank? Or are you required to make concessions if both top and jungle pick assassins? Are you allowed to dictate for the team a play style where you are a damage dealer and there is no tank? \n\nAre the answers to these questions open for personal interpretation? should you be able to make your own mind on how you approach the \"Tank issue\" from a mid lane's perspective? or  should you adhere to \"the meta\"? \n\nand if you must follow \"the meta\", how is the meta itself allowed to change? Let's suppose there are two conflicting ideas in the meta: \"there must be a tank who is not the support in every team\" and \"the mid laner never picks a tank\". If we assume you \"know\" the answer, is someone else allowed to come and coerce a different answer on the team? If not, how are people who want to play differently able to bring their different play styles to ranked? \n\nMy stance is that all these questions are open for the personal interpretation of the players involved. Each player should make his/her own decision as to what his \"role\" is about, and play according to their decision. Since it is highly likely that many players will want to stick to some parts of the meta like glue, dissenting players cannot be asked to depend upon team agreement, and therefore should not be coerced into following accepted conventions s.a. \"the support's role is to provide vision\" or \"the mid lane's role is to deal damage\" or \"the top lane is the tank\".\n\nI believe your stance is that there are strict conventions as to what the responsibilities of the different \"lane assignments\" are, and players should not be allowed to deviate from those conventions on their own. I object to this stance. \n\nSince I also assume that team agreement is largely unattainable for big deviations from the conventional play style, my stance is that team agreement should not be a requirement, and instead i offer the following solutions: you disagree? deal with it.

If you want more gold, don't say \"hey, I know you are the adc and are supposed to be a damage deale, BUT I want to do all the damage because I don't like supporting.\" That is basically what you are telling me. There is nothing wrong with playing a support champ mid or even flipping bot and top. There is a problem, however, when you decide to ruin the experience for other players at the expense of yourself being greedy and thinking you can play every role even though you locked support.
