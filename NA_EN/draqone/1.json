Lets investigate:\n\nTo move the sidelane you need to cross about 8100 units. To move to midlane you need around 6500 units.\n\n**First, lets assume the most favourable scenario:**\nYou have 325 base movement speed. With the wind Dragon you have 340 movement speed. \n\nTherefore it takes 20 seconds for midlane and 25 for sidelane. \nThis means a single wind dragon saves you 0.89 of a second when you move to the midlane and 1.1 of a second moving to the sidelane. \n\n**A normal scenario:**\nYou have 340 movement speed, 45 from boots. You also have an item that increases your movement speed by 5%. \nWithout dragon: 404 movement speed. **16** seconds to get to midlane. **20** seconds to get to sidelane. \nWith the dragon: 420 movement speed. **15.5 **seconds to get to midlane.** 19.3** seconds to get to sidelane.\n\n\nYou are considered &quot;out of combat&quot; if you did not deal or receive damage in the last 5 seconds. \nThe wind dragon is useless when splitpushing since you are in combat with minions and for junglers since you are in combat with the camps -  the out of combat buff doesn&#039;t kick in before you start another camp. \n\n**Conclusion: \nThe wind dragon saves you between 0.5 and 1.1 of a second each time you move to lane. It&#039;s useless in nearly every other scenario.**","replies":[{"poster":"Quepha","date":"2016-06-09T02:55:30.213+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"An ally being one second late to a fight has massive implications.

Taking the cloud drake takes time. And the drake doesn't give you any other benefits except save time unless you get to the elder drake.\n\nThe tradeoff is not worth it as the time spent taking the drake is far greater than the time saved by running to lane.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2016-06-09T00:14:32.452+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"That .5-1.1 sec may be worthwhile when roaming for ganks.","replies":[{"poster":"Voluug13","date":"2016-06-09T01:01:47.085+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Not for a contested buff like dragon.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"EcchiOtakuTM","date":"2016-06-09T04:32:20.157+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So basically give cloud dragon the furor enchant additionally and it should be great.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Yetii Rider","date":"2016-06-09T02:50:48.977+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually the most favorable situation (and one of the reasons Cloud Drakes help so much) is when you're playing a jungler that has a % ms amp that they use to gank (Hecarim's Devastating Charge, Rammus's Power Ball, Master Yi's Highlander, Rengar's Thrill of the Hunt, Shyvana's Burnout, and the Scuttle Shrine on every champion). \n\nPlus, you're only accounting for one Cloud Drake. 15 MS may seem weak but 45 is amazing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"jaymc1130","date":"2016-06-09T01:06:56.011+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Home guard TP plays...
