If you walk into a ball field you are dead, but she can&#039;t just 100 - 0 you without setting up the balls first.\r\n\r\nit&#039;d also be good for soloQ/ competitive balance since pro players should be better at avoiding ball fields, and thus she wouldn&#039;t be a 100% pick/ban.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-10-11T22:46:59.384+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Durrr.\n\nMore syndra ragethreads inc, handle agro.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Catastrop","date":"2016-10-11T22:40:48.079+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"She already can't 100-0 with just 3 balls anyway. You're suggestion is, no offense, pointless because it's exactly how it works already. More spheres=More damage. \nThe only you'll die with a 3 sphere ult is if you're really low, or she did a standard combo, which still isn't a 3 sphere ult either way.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Surr20plz","date":"2016-10-11T22:32:49.056+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Let's talk about HURRRRDDUURRRRR.\n\nI saw HURRRRDUURRRR at worlds and now I think that HURRRRRRR needs some DURRRRRRRR.","replies":[]}]}
