Note that each server or service you access (youtube, skype, League, Google) are all located in different geolocations and your network route to each server takes different pathways or nodes. This means you could have a good connection to one server, but run into routing issues to another.\n\nI strongly recommend working through our [connection guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues), as local network configurations have the highest chance of causing connectivity issues in League.\n\nLet me know if those steps caused any change in your problem.","replies":[]}]}
