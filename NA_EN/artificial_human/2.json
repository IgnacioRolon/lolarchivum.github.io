The bad part is that old Sion was one of the worst designed champions, so heavily improving on that was not a tall task. In fact, if he didn't keep his name you probably wouldn't be able to tell Sion was a rework instead of a new champion entirely.\n\nAs for current Sion, his problems stem from his unreliability. His abilities can either be easily dodged, counterplayed, or both. The most reliable form of damage he has is bowling minions; that says a lot. Sion is one of those champions where even if you manage to land his skills perfectly, you're counting on your team to follow up. And sometimes they don't.\n\nThat's not to say Sion doesn't have damage of his own, but if you whiff all your skills because the person you're trying to target is a {{champion:7}} or a {{champion:105}} (or anyone with half a brain and even a mediocre amount of mobility) then all those base damages and ratios mean exactly jack shit. I suppose you could just ult at point blank range and set up the combo from there, but I have the thought the Rioters that designed his kit wanted you to ult from range.\n\nOf course, that thought is silly. If they wanted Sion's ult to be viable at range they wouldn't have made steering him like {{champion:64}} driving a car and alerting the entire map the moment you hit R so they can all hang back to prepare for it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MLDzXnRRR","date":"2015-11-18T17:03:19.769+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Overnerfed his laning...","replies":[{"poster":"Artificial Human","date":"2015-11-18T17:12:13.979+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":1,"body":"His E was in fact too strong, far too strong.","replies":[{"poster":"Hawkefire","date":"2015-11-18T21:56:39.010+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"Aye, but it wasn't the E nerfs that killed him.

I get the idea, but it still is super OP and there would need to be nerfs in other areas to make this work, which I don't want, his entire kit is fair or less atm, so I don wanna see mo' nerfs.","replies":[{"poster":"Spoofghoul","date":"2015-11-18T21:07:29.076+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Dumbest argument ive ever heard balancing around pro's \nFollowed up by the second dumbest argument needs nerfs over there cos he got a buff over here.\n\nSeriously who balances a game with millions of players only for the top 100 players...\n\nAnd the entire point of a buff is to make something stronger not to justify a nerf elsewhere because then he would not be buffed.\n\nCome on the red health properties can be anything i just pulled some shit out of my arse as to what it would do.\n\nAt least it would be an extra balancing lever around his health farming. Right now Sion isnt good at anything his skills are unreliable his base stats are weak so his tankyness is unreliable aswell.\n\nNow when you play Sion you are punished harder then any other champion for having bad farm...
