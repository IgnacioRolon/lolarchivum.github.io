This account was new one with allchat disabled at first cuz every game there are kids on enemy team who spam EZ and EASY cuz they can. These chatlogs weren't nearly as toxic as some of my friends have been over the years and this one got immediate 14 day suspension without a warning. The stats don't add up just like the ban system doesn't work lol. Guess imma be disabling allchat forever then and doing /mute all every start of the game cuz showing a little bit of NEGATIVE HUMAN EMOTIONS is apparently a reason to jail a person...Trash system by far and im not the only one that thinks about that like this lol\n\nAnd NO, i haven't been \"toxic\" in the past game as i said i had allchat disabled and i enabled it cuz we had an enemy player who was from the same country as i was.
