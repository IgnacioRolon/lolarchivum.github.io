My problem is: I have 44rp and if I buy a prepaid card I would have 1624rp but I want to buy infernal nasus (1820rp). Would riot give me the rp left (196) to buy the skin if I draw something and send it to them? \r\n\r\nThanks.","replies":[{"poster":"the Anarchit3cht","date":"2017-01-03T07:07:25.757+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They typically only give anything sub 80 from what most people I know have experienced.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-03T05:41:36.923+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"196 RP eh? That's a decent chunk of RP, so I'm not sure we'd be able to manage to help out with that much. If you need a lower amount in the future, feel free to reach out in a [**support ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and we'll see what we can do.
