When I jumped into a game my excitement quickly turned to frustration when I discovered I was lagging. Both my ping and fps are normal and I checked my task manager to find everything running fine. Its like a weird delay on everything I do in game and randomly my character moves like as if they are slowed then they go into a speed boost to catch up to the real in game time if I had been moving for awhile. I reinstalled the game and made sure to update all of my computers divers to find no relief. I'm near certain it is caused by the new patch some how but I'm unsure and I don't know what to do. I'm close to doing a factory restore on my computer but dread doing so when considering my saved files. So before I do something crazy as such I ask, is there any known issues with the current patch?\r\n{{sticker:zombie-nunu-bummed}}","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-03-31T21:08:23.150+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First of all, I'm so jealous of your Pug'Maw XD!\n\nBack to business, this sounds like you're experiencing packet loss.
