What operating system, device, and browser version you're using? We've been testing this internally and although the load times can be a little slow on mobile devices for instance, when you're not on wireless, it's only by a couple of minutes at most for the entire comic. 15 minutes is definitely excessive.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Iceborn","date":"2019-03-09T23:04:32.742+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes its laggy for me too... But honestly youll just have to wait until they fix it or try another browser(I use chrome and its laggy atm) or youll have to wait till they fix it..\nIf you love the comics you can also buy them on the marvel comic app or comicology, since they have more content there and no lags. But again just wait till the lag gets better","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Trent","date":"2019-03-10T01:44:21.119+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Upgrade your computer maybe? The site was slow for me on my old computer. Other than that it's probably your internet or add ons (most add ons are viruses tho so idk why you would have any other than adblock).","replies":[]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-03-10T00:06:39.912+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's modern web design for you. The site is nothing more than a photo gallery, which has been a thing on the Internet for about 30 years now. It's a solved problem with a dozen lines of HTML per page plus a couple MB for each image. Each page of such a gallery would load in less than a second, but Riot's Rich Media Web 2.0 masterpiece is loaded with so much crap that it's unusable. 3+ minutes to load; that's atrocious.","replies":[]}]}
