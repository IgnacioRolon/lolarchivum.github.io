I tried going into the files but whenever I would press tab it would lvl up a random spell instead of letting me press tab then corresponding spell to lvl it up.\r\n\r\nIf this isnt implemented in the current client I hope this is resolved in the next because I am put at a very high disadvantage compared to higher elo players when this happens","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-04T04:51:20.728+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The new client actually doesn't change anything you see past champ select as far as I know.
