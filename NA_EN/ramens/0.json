After getting dropped down in honor, you simply need to keep playing \"honorable\" games (without anything that would deserve a punishment) and get honored by teammates. There isn't a set amount of time, but after you've shown the system that you've reformed your honor will start to rise again.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Valeeva","date":"2017-12-10T20:31:58.701+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your Honor has nothing to do about who you get teamed up with. It has no effect on the matchmaking system at all.\n\nYou will gain honor by your teammates \"honoring\" you in the post game screen, which means you have to change your attitude, be less toxic and be helpful towards your team so you can get your honor level back up.","replies":[]}]}
