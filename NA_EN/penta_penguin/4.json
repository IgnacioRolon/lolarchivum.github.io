It's a play that's potentially fairly powerful, but dependent both on you as the jungler opting to try for a riskier gank and on Illaoi playing it well.","replies":[{"poster":"SpecterVonBaren","date":"2015-11-12T08:48:55.820+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What are your thoughts on having Heimer and Illaoi duo bot lane?
