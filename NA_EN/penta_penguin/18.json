So many people will call you &#039;satan&#039; or say something else similarly bigoted, and Riot just goes along with it (Look at the &quot;Devil Teemo&quot; skin... problematic much?).  People don&#039;t care that you&#039;re good at Teemo and will even insult you for playing enough Teemo to reach Mastery 7. Until you&#039;re 10/0 picking up Quadra kills nobody wants to acknowledge you or your struggles. But if Ahri is 2/2 and gets a double kill with a gank everyone is like &quot;GJ&quot;.
