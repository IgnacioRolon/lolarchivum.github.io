This is **Jinx, Jhin, Caitlyn, Draven, Ezreal**.\n\n&quot;Play-makers&quot;\n\nHere we have Marksman that feature big, game-changing, momentous abilities and play-making potential outside of just dealing damage. They may also offer strong utility in other ways. This is **Ashe, Sivir, Quinn, Varus, Kalista, Kindred, Urgot, Teemo** (still a marksman folks)\n\nThere are even a few cross-class Hybrids like Quinn (brings raw damage with game-changing roam potential), Varus (Pokes at fairly long range but also brings that nice Ulti to team-fights), and Ashe (delivers big stuns from anywhere on the map).\n\nEDIT: Just my personal name suggestions in the order above; **Hunters** (or **Bounty Hunters**), keep **Snipers**, **Rangers**","replies":[{"poster":"67chrome","date":"2016-04-19T19:58:19.043+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's not a bad breakdown.\n\nThere is a lot of diversity in the marksman archetype, especially with the archetype being capable of lanning anywhere ATM and the great diversity and build routes marksman itemization provides. \nMakes sense they should have at least 2 sub-classes.\n\nIssue I keep running into when trying to describe them is that marksman don't really clump together in specific play-styles though. You can pick a few on the edges with a lot of unique characteristics, but then there's a wide range of marksman stuck in a middle ground for the class.","replies":[{"poster":"Penta Penguin","date":"2016-04-20T01:12:27.266+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah that's true","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Moon Mom","date":"2016-04-19T20:06:19.866+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Love the breakdown :).","replies":[{"poster":"Penta Penguin","date":"2016-04-20T00:59:29.151+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks friendo~","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"The Loveless","date":"2016-04-19T20:10:05.995+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even with his ult, I wouldn't call Draven a sniper.

However, I would suggest Corki under the sniper subclass, as he is poke oriented with his very long range and low cool down ult and strong bomb (could also classify as play maker due to his Package offering incredibly impactful spikes). \n\nI think kog could also be classed as a sniper considering the very long range of all his abilities and w auto attacks, as well as being very strong when stationary (like an actual sniper!). \n\ndraven is definitely damage oriented though, certainly not a sniper just because of his ult! \n\nThese are a good start at defining the class as a whole. Riot definitely could have done more in this regard.","replies":[{"poster":"Penta Penguin","date":"2016-04-20T00:55:15.083+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for mentioning that, I forgot about Special Delivery.\n\nI think maybe if sub-classes still get sorted as \"primary\" and \"secondary\" as the tags are now, then champs with poke like Corki could also be snipers\n\nMy logic was that \"Snipers\" were the champs with extraordinary (pretty much global) range abilities with a huge gap between their range, and the range of even pokers. But maybe SNiper could be more about both long-range and having to aim difficult shots, to include shorter range stuff like Varus, Corki and Kog'maw","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"JRobin31","date":"2016-04-19T21:30:09.768+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like your breakdown.\nBut where exactly do \"hyper-kites\" fit?  Some ADCs rely on superior mobility to kite their opponents to death rather than raw damage, burst, or play-making.  They can be distinguished from other ADCs that just aren't as mobile.  Blue Ezreal is the kite-you-to-death champion.  It isn't about raw damage, burst, or play-making - just about being more mobile to chase you down or run away while dealing damage.","replies":[{"poster":"Penta Penguin","date":"2016-04-20T00:47:24.956+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think that's a good point and could be it's own sub-class.

You put Corki in the same place as Vayne. Same with Ashe and Quinn.
