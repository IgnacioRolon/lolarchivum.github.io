One of core gripes with the old champions is that their lines are generic to the point of making the characters look like caricatures and pop culture references (Gangplank is a pirate so he says typical pirate stuff, Shaco is a jester, so he says typical jester stuff...)

Instead of easy to digest \"walls of text,\" your team chose to \"let players fill in the blanks.\"  Instead of full stories, your company told champion expositions and abandoned them soon afterwards for reasons that still baffle.  Instead of giving us content that we could digest and discuss, you took away what we loved and put nothing in return.  Then, you switched departments and let the new guys deal with the messes you left behind.\n\nNote that this isn't just about you, Opeli.  Kitae, Runaan, Entropy, TommyGnox and everyone else involved with League's lore up until the Retcon are equally to blame for the mess that is League's current story.  All of you destroyed what little was there and created a gulf between the fans and the company, then ran away to let others deal with.\n\nI'm glad you're still poking around the boards, Opeli.
