Which is extremely dumb to do. Modre was  monster pusher pre-rework and while he was clunky, he was still good and had an identity as a slow moving AoE killing machine. Now his AoE is shot. His Q is a joke and his W is the worse ability in the game. He is now made to be a snowballing monster that gets to 6 before anyone, takes dragon ghost and then facerolls on the enemy team. That is not good game design and being a snowballing champion is no excuse for the lackluster base stats he has. Sure he now has the highest AD but that does not do jack when he is slow and frail. even with his passive which has been nerfed even if he can now store 25% of it. \n\nI wrote a post on my Ideas on what to do with morde a while back and while it got some hate, I still think it's worth a shot checking it out. \n\nLink: http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/UkqwHBEx-suggestions-to-fixing-mordekaiser","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Skias","date":"2015-10-04T16:23:48.729+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=DragonShea,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=jQK0TqdR,comment-id=0002000000020000,timestamp=2015-10-03T12:33:41.955+0000)\n>\n> And you could.. be less of a dick and criticise my post in a more constructive and respectful manner.

You would make post all the time about Yasuo if he was treated this way with a rework like Morde's or Cass'. Understand that Riot lied in saying they would help out these champions. They ruined their identity as a champion. Imagine if Riot decided to make a champion like{{champion:36}} a beefy fighter into a squishy mage don't you think that's unfair to the champions playerbase who play Mundo for who he is? A fighter that can literally go where he pleases because he can just eat damage and regen his hp fast is what makes Mundo's identity. Now imagine if Riot decided that he should just be a squishy mage that has to auto attack too do his damage and that he would be given no mobility of getting to his target and no real way of ccing them. You don't think that people have the right to call Riot out on their BS?","replies":[{"poster":"Slamurai Jack","date":"2015-10-04T12:01:51.420+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"The attachement to old Morde really is astounding. He was either completely broken or garbage and there was no reason to pick him over any other champ whenever he wasn't broken. His kit provided no points of meaningful interaction for his opponent if the matchup was favorable to Morde and very few points of meaningful interaction for Morde if he was in an unfavorable matchup. His kit was the most underloaded piece of garbage in League and possessed 0 playmaking ability whatsoever, very problematic for a solo laner. 0 CC and 0 gap closers with enormous pushing power and innate survivability turned every lane into a non-stop shovefest that Morde typically won by default until the enemy jungler showed up to collect a free kill. \n\nYou want Morde to keep his 0 CC  and 0 gap closer kit and still be viable but not broken? He has to go bot so that allies can do the playmaking for him. Solo lane Morde either had a good matchup and had no meaningful counterplay or had a bad matchup and did pretty much nothing. His balance of good and bad matchups was entirely determined by how strong Riot felt like letting him be at the time since Morde had 0 mechanical complexity to him. And lately, most of his matchups weren't great; Riot rightly realized how helpless it was to be against Morde when he was strong and kept him weak intentionally. Now that Morde is a bot laner, there's far more variables to tune on Mordekaiser and Riot actually has a chance of balancing him to a healthy place in the game, even if they're nowhere near that point yet.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Wolfeur","date":"2015-10-02T23:40:26.490+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"OP =/= Unhealthy\n\nThose are different problems.","replies":[{"poster":"B1naryB0t","date":"2015-10-03T19:17:57.467+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"OP would equate to overtuned numbers.
