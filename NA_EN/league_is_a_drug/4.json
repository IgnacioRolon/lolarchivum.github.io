It would be so cool and good! They could be clever in how to set up the storyline, but I'm sure I would enjoy it either way. So I wanted to set up this poll so we can try to get Riot to write an anime series for League. Please vote, this could potentially happen!","replies":[{"poster":"Baron of Bread","date":"2015-03-14T21:50:48.981+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"I think there is a show based off of League called La La Demacia, you might want to give it a look.","replies":[{"poster":"League is a Drug","date":"2015-03-14T22:17:01.986+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Baron of Bread,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=Rir5eEo0,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-03-14T21:50:48.981+0000)\n>\n> I think there is a show based off of League called La La Demacia, you might want to give it a look.\n\nOkay, from the first little bit I watched before my game started, it looked good haha. Still though, I think it would be best if Riot wrote the storyline. But thanks for telling me about La La La Demacia! I will probably get into it :p","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Locriann","date":"2015-03-15T00:18:57.739+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I LOVE anime (No I don't go to conventions) and I think this would be a great idea!
