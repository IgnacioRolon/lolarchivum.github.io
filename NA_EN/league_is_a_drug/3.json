I don't think I'm the only one who would enjoy this change, so I am asking Riot to change this in the next patch and I will be very happy.\r\n\r\nAnd I can't remember if {{item:2004}} show up either because I don't buy them a lot and I didn't see them in the patch 4.21 notes, but if they don't, please change this too.\r\nThanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Dingding123","date":"2015-01-12T16:47:02.726+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've got the Biscuit in my sights","replies":[]}]}
