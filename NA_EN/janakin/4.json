Fact that over 120 million players play each month. Fact Diamond and above are the top 3% of the player base. So there is no way this was made for the average player. The que times for the average bronze silver and gold players at the time was never 10mins Fact.  I played before the system was in place, the longest i ever waited and i was gold, was 5 min and that was a sole rare occasion.

It is a statement based off of what Riot has said, and I would trust their word over you, Fallenshaw, unless you're secretly a disgruntled Riot employee sharing trade secrets and hoping your manager doesn't find out. *shrugs* Could be, I suppose.\n\nRiot has stated on numerous cases that without an auto-fill system but WITH a 'queue for role' system, the wait times would be insane due to the disparity of role preference. You can doubt them if you wish, but they have the data and I choose to trust them on this since it makes sense. As a support my queue times are insanely low, near-instant most of the time. The only way this makes sense is if there is a massive disparity in role preference.\n\nPrior to this system being in place, EVERYONE played fill. So every game you were auto-filled. Literally every game. That's why queue times were low. Because every game your role was largely random, so of course they could make games fast. They didn't have to care what the players wanted to play, they could just throw any five players in the same rank range together and say 'have at it!'\n\nIt is perfectly reasonable to prefer that system. I don't, I like that I can queue for the role I want to play and have a relatively good chance of getting it. To each their own there.\n\nHowever, claiming there was LESS toxicity in the past is rose-coloured glasses at work. You're forgetting all the negativity. Champ select was FULL of people bitching that someone else picked their role when they'd called it, and whining about who had to be support, and fighting over roles. I can't count the number of 'okay we're both jungling' or 'welp I guess we have no jungler! Have fun!' because nobody wanted to do it. Hell, the toxicity over trying to pick who had to support was a large part of why I started maining support. I figured it was easier for me to just play it and learn to love it than to have to deal with people fighting to avoid it every game.

I actually want anyone to reply to this telling me a reason why auto fill is in the game, who gives a shit if ur queue timer is a minute faster, i want to play my damn role and i dont understand why riot thinks autofilling is gonna help anyone have more fun or have a better game.

I'd happily wait 3-4 minutes to get what I want. ESPECIALLY considering I have to go through 4-5 dodges between matches because of the autofill system that's supposed to get me in quicker. Seriously, I once went through 7 fucking dodges before I got into a game. At least half of them the autofilled person waited until the last possible fucking second to leave, wasting even more of my time. \n\nThe whole autofill system is poorly thought out, implemented, and whoever the fuck though of it needs to be fired. It's not possible for people to get better at what they want if they are forced into doing stupid shit they don't enjoy. It certainly isn't an issue with there not being enough players, and even if it were merging servers would solve the issue.\n\nThis coming from a Support main...i'd rather have people on my team that get what they want as opposed to people who are forced into it. \n\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-clap}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"PiVoRx","date":"2019-05-27T14:32:52.316+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I actually miss pick order of S4, at least i could ask to go supp if i didnt get a main role.","replies":[]}]}
