Don't understand that. You would still have to build items depending on your champions combo which depends on champions that you choose from random rolls.\n2. That is true. However, when you are already forced into building certain champions combo (because the RNG rolls forced you to), you depend on certain items drop that synergizes with that combo. If you get shit items, you are in a disadvantage compared to your opponents.\n3. Again, this is already secured by champions being randomized.\n4. This is also true. But this point also applies to summoner's rift rankeds -- theoretically, there's no need to create a system that would protect you from losing LP if you have an afk teammate. If you play many games, and you never leave, you will actually benefit from people going afk (5 potential enemy leavers vs 4 potential teammate leavers). However, it still feels terrible to lose LP like that, and the system should be there.","replies":[{"poster":"iainB85","date":"2019-07-12T01:54:09.617+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"1-2-3) But people would quickly find out the optimal items for every team composition they are building and it would quickly devolve into who rolled the better champions, which would be even more frustrating. \n\nHaving randomness to what items you get forces you to switch up strategies dynamically far more than if you could just build whatever items you wanted based on what champions you are offered.\n\n4) You keep comparing it to Summoner's Rift, but it's a bad comparison. The only real thing they have in common is the champions and one ability. \n\nAuto Chess games completely take away control of individual champions, so you NEED to have other hard choices like what items to get based on what is available and what you have already gotten and if you should stick with your champions based on what you have been offered.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Romans VI XXIII","date":"2019-07-12T00:01:49.759+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If this where a thing then they would have to remove spatula. or make it so expensive its useless.\n\nIf they didn't you could:\n1.
