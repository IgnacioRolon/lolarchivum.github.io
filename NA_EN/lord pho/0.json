It would be very nice to the players out in the world who wants a skin or legacy skins or wards that they wanted for a long time to get it. I know the Riot Games makes money from all the gift cards, but what if players have no RP and ran out of IP to buy a champion or chrome skins, at least Riot can give the players a random gift for events, and the players who can&#039;t afford to buy gift cards. Especially for the players that had their account banned or suspended, at least give them 1 more chance of trying to redeem their selves. Because, who knows why the player got suspended or banned. Maybe because they had poor network connection when they were playing a league game (like me and im not trying to offend people btw) and their teammates took it too personal and everybody reported that player just because they think that player left on purpose. \r\n(This is just a suggestion for Riot, i don&#039;t mean it personally)","replies":[{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2016-10-14T05:09:40.521+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Almost everyone has had second chances. Thats what chat restrictions and  suspensions are.\n\nAs for your case, it is very difficult to get banned just for leaving matches. You have to leave very consistently for that. It is also your responsibility to make sure your network is suitable to play on, which it wasn't apparently. It isn't WHY you left, its THAT you left.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nik Nikerson","date":"2016-10-14T03:53:07.066+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> who knows why the player got suspended or banned.\n\nPretty sure Riot knows.","replies":[{"poster":"themachamp","date":"2016-10-14T03:56:20.695+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Nik Nikerson,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=tFiuKonh,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-10-14T03:53:07.066+0000)\n>\n> Pretty sure Riot knows.\n\nThey only see the end product...very rarely do they see the causality.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sarutobi","date":"2016-10-14T06:59:25.909+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They have been giving us stuff for Xmas, birthday could be something to look into,but who knows!","replies":[]}]}
