We decided to leave out Hecarim and Veigar due to both space (didn't want to cram his eyes into a point that would be largely covered anyways), and time (we had to do this fast considering everything going on!). We decided to focus on the new skins and focal area the most.\n\nAlso, Hecarim going sideways might feel strange when we consider how the background moves forward so fast, as zzman mentioned!\n\nLet me know if you have any more questions about this! Sorry for the lateness, but I figured I should try to be more active on the boards recently, so here I am making up for lost time  :)\n\nThank you!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Captain Astora","date":"2015-08-23T04:34:51.073+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He is the Waves of light rushing in the backgrounds, too fast to see.","replies":[]},{"poster":"zzman73051","date":"2015-08-23T04:34:02.860+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"they didnt put him in the login screen cuz where sona riven and mf are just kinda moving a little, Hec is in the middle of a full on jump. if he was in there they would basically just have to having him floating there","replies":[]},{"poster":"lightdragoon88","date":"2015-08-23T04:32:17.458+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1) He not sexy enough\n\n2) He is, but cut off: http://s.lolstatic.com/site/skins-arcade/ff906c7f62b2ff24f60a10fdeeb4803fbb1fd7c3/images/extras/wallpaper/Arcade_Art_1920x1080.jpg","replies":[]},{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2015-08-23T04:31:38.499+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He's just off to the right on the full picture, but they probably didn't want to make the picture small enough to include it.\n\nhttp://s.lolstatic.com/site/skins-arcade/ff906c7f62b2ff24f60a10fdeeb4803fbb1fd7c3/images/extras/wallpaper/Arcade_Art_3840x1080.jpg","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chicken4dinner","date":"2015-08-23T04:30:30.735+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And Veigar in the top left corner","replies":[]}]}
