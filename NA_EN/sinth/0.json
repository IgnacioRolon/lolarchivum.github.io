It&#039;s like I don&#039;t travel as far as I&#039;m supposed to go, and come down in the wrong spot.  This actually has a big impact on the utility, since you can&#039;t knock an opponent back towards your team effectively by chaining the Q, and you also have to wait to see where you land before hitting the Q since you can&#039;t predict where you&#039;ll be positioned relative to opponent.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2017-01-25T18:01:33.929+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Heyo! \n\nThanks for the report! Off the top of my head, I'm not sure what may be causing something like this to happen. Lemme pass it on to my good friend Riot LoveStrut - he's the QA on this project! He can take a look and figure out what's going on. ^-^","replies":[]}]}
