If yes, where? \n(Obviously not to steal them and use them for grievous things, just to play around, have fun, educate myself and maybe submit some of my own ideas)\nAnd if any Riot guy reads this, could you guys consider releasing atleast some of them, just short lines would already be very very helpful! \n\nThanks!\n\n(Link to the Site : http://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/2016/12/developing-dark-star-thresh/)\n\n(Edit: I falsely posted this on the German forum, moved it to here. If that&#039;s still not the right forum, i will throw my PC out of my window. I&#039;m not a forum wizard geez)\n\nEdit 2: \nHere's the Dropbox link for anyone who want's to listen to it. It's probably not useful for an ingame environment, it's very wide and loud and would sound totally out of place.\n\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/ufzjyeyfubpboxc/DarkStar%20Tresh%20Original%20Clean%20AND%20Self%20Edit.wav?dl=0","replies":[{"poster":"Riot TreblMuffin","date":"2017-05-17T17:27:33.824+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dude, post it up we'd love to hear it! That's a great technique to refine your sound chops. John Frusciante used to talk about the best way to get guitar chops is just to play along with records and try to sound exactly like the guitar player on there. In no time you can cover any style you want and hopefully develop your own style.\n\nI'd say record your own stuff when you can and just mess with it. Come up with a character in your mind and ask how they would sound? Where are they from? What are people like there? What do they wear? Are they big? Are they small? Are they even human?!","replies":[{"poster":"Vanye Best","date":"2017-05-19T09:54:24.859+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I left a Dropbox link as edit!\nThanks for the reply! Love how active Rioters are on the forum!\n\nIt's actually been my dream for years to work at RiotGames eventually, after i get all my school done, in my opinion there isn't any other game developer that does so much for their game with such passion like riot does!","replies":[{"poster":"Riot TreblMuffin","date":"2017-05-22T22:04:35.096+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sounds really cool. You definitely got the flavor of Darkstar in there! Regarding \"unedited\" voice files for champions like Thresh etc; no, but I imagine a resourceful audio nerd could imagine some way to get their hands on a snippet or two of the right VO for practice and learnin'. You might want to check the googles. You've got em all over the interwebs for most champions! Try making a thematic for Ezreal or Jinx. Their base VO is basically clean.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"mr Boombastic787","date":"2017-05-19T17:32:48.405+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That is some great stuff you've done!
