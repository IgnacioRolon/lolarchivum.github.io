I had a pretty rough start with her as I started to play her directly in Ranked(First in plat, now I'm in Diamond, won my promos yesterday with {{champion:420}} {{champion:114}} {{champion:60}} [Here](http://imgur.com/LMAtANF), because normals won't pop up in draft. After about 20 games I'm performing ridiculously well with her, If i get ganked its usually a double kill for me. She's not undertuned, in fact, I feel she is very overtuned, but she is quite hard to play. Not from a mechanical POV but from strategic one. You have to know exactly when is the best time to use your R and E. Positioning is crucial and you can't spam W mindlessly. Illaoi's tentacles are like Orianna's ball or Heimer's turrets. Your entire kit is based to play around them, and doing so away from them is a secured loss. That's why her ultimate creates a temporal power zone and why It's so hard to get good with her, no other melee champion in the game has a similar pattern.\n\nIf you check champion.gg and Illaoi, you'll see after 50 games people have close to 60% win rate with her. \n\nI'm starting to believe the statement \"There is no weak champion but bad players\" is absolutely true.

Against the OP picks. Why? How?\n\nBoth these things can be true: balance can be terrible, and yet often not determine the outcome of the game.\n\nLet's say a given champ had a winrate of 62%. That would be a _horribly_ unbalanced champ. However, it would also mean that the outcome of the game was **usually** not being determined by that champ. There are so many other factors that affect the outcome of a game (9 other players, AFKs, you name it), that unless a champ can automatically 1v5 from level 1, they can't guarantee a win by themselves every time. That doesn't mean that all champs are automatically balanced, though.","replies":[]},{"poster":"FooDang","date":"2016-02-14T16:49:04.388+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Skill>FOTM until Master through challenger where mechanics has been mastered by that player base, the only difference is champion kit.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ChargeItDownMid","date":"2016-02-14T06:17:17.014+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":5,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Slamurai Jack","date":"2016-02-14T11:06:49.111+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Pick and Ban rate are merely a reflection of what the community as a whole thinks is good and enjoyable to play.

That's the only stat you need to know Lee is garbage in Solo Q.\n\nAnd to answer your question, almost none of them. I remember at the beginning of Season 5 when Jinx had a 55% winrate and around a 10% pickrate. Then she became FOTM due to LCS and her pickrate shot all the way up to 40%. Her winrate? Didn't fucking budge. Stayed at around 55% regardless of her pickrate. She's not the only example of this either. Vayne saw a similar trend in mid season 5 where her playrate spiked massively and her winrate didn't move at all. The idea that high pickrates massively drive down winrates and that low pickrates massively push up winrates makes sense in theory, but only when other variables are unknown and even when it does have an effect, it's impossible to tell exactly how much. The idea that a balanced champion would have their winrate drop to the lowest in the game were they to suddenly become very popular is completely ridiculous and not supported at all by the many times champions have seen sudden spikes in popularity with a negligible impact on their winrate.\n\nOut of curiosity, how do you explain champions with both very high winrates and pick rates? At this point, Janna has a 54% winrate and a 22% pickrate. And yet, I'm willing to bet you don't think Janna is super OP, even though according to your theory, she would easily have a winrate well over 60% if she were picked less. Hell, you used that exact argument for Zed and Janna's pickrate and winrate are both far higher than his.

She's strong. very, very strong. I have the most mastery points with her, at 54.9k points, she's my most played ADC, and I pick her almost blindly, knowing I will perform [very well](http://imgur.com/ZrrGNIi), only and ONLY avoiding to pick her into {{champion:54}} as he is the only diver in this game who can bypass skill and good positioning and still kill you, with no major punishment or risks for him.  \n\nI don't mind the enemy team having divers. In fact, sometimes they even make things easier killing themselves by trying to dive me and get permenently slowed. If I'm against a heavy mobility composition I usually go {{item:3508}} {{item:3085}} and they just CANT dive me. No amount of dashes on tanky champions is going to make you catch an Ashe with CDR kiting you. In my experience, so far. Notice please that at this rating {{champion:238}} {{champion:114}} {{champion:36}} {{champion:48}} are spammed. My only current problem aside Malphite is {{champion:77}} but he is being banned every game.","replies":[]}]}]}
