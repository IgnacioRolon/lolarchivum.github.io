Running through the list in my head I started to wonder about Yorik as well as a few others, but Yorik specifically.  Is he going to be reclassified as a juggernaut because I honestly could see him becoming very viable and completely unique running in that theme.\r\n\r\nThat being said, I would also like to know how you are making a differentiation between Tank and Juggernaut, or on the flip side, Bruiser/Fighter and Juggernaut.  There seems to be a fair amount of overlap here, unless you are renaming these archetypes, which honestly I would prefer.","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2015-08-08T20:04:36.746+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"We see juggernauts as a sub class of fighters/brawlers/bruisers/whatever else you want to call them. That's a really large group of champions that ranges from the really mobile characters that build damage only, like Tryndamere, to the immobile champs that build tanky like Nasus. We've been looking at a series of sub groups with that larger fighter group as a result as follows:\n\n* Juggernauts - Immobile, tough, build one to two offensive items on average (e.g. Nasus or Garen)\n* Divers - Pretty mobile, and really good at getting onto specific targets they want to kill, builds a little bit more offensively than juggernauts (e.g. Irelia or Xin Zhao)\n* Light fighters (need a better name for this group - Highly mobile, builds almost entirely offense, often good at killing multiple targets, usually squishy with windowed defense of evasieness (e.g. Trynd or Fiora).\n\nBiggest contrast between tanks and juggernauts is in what each group is trying do. Tanks are generally trying to initiate or peel more, kill by themselves less. They build almost mainly (sometimes exclusively) defense/utility and have a greater amount of mobility, generally tied to initiation or peeling actions. \n\nAs far as other juggernauts go, Olaf, Shyvana are the next two we're planning on looking at. Yorick's arguably a juggernaut, he'll get a full relaunch though. Volibear could be described as a juggernaut, though he's also got some diver and tank bits to him. Mundo also shares some juggernaut characteristics, but doesn't really match overall (which is fine, we're looking to use these descriptions as ways to map similarities and differences between champions, not because every champion has to be forced into a specific category).","replies":[{"poster":"ExecutorDill","date":"2015-08-08T20:37:24.775+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Juggernaut Shen {{champion:98}}..Please..

IE will we start seeing sub classifications of tanks or sub classifications of Marksmen.  Mages already kinda have that with the glasscannon vs sustained damage mage vs cc mage.  \n\nAlso would it be possible to search these archetypes when doing a character search like you currently can with \"marksman\" or \"mage\"?  \n\nAnd in regards to your \"Light Fighter\" need for a name.  Go with Skirmishers.  Realistically that's what they are and what they excel in.  They enjoy a good skirmish and have a way out when they are done.  \n\nWhile I agree that Shyvanna could be more juggernaut I'd think she fell more into the tank side, where she engages with super power but overall is content being the focus of the enemy team, and much less focused on taking people out.  Olaf fits your description pretty well too.  I know that Yorik is getting a full rework but I wasn't sure if we were looking more at a Fighter setup or a control mage setup, or a juggernaut setup.  \n\nAs far as other people that may end up in this classification, would Gragas, Trundle, Renekton, Cho, or even J4 be thrown in here.  I know you don't want to make the people fit the mold but does the mold fit these people.

We'll likely look at clarifying some of those groups, particularly those that need items to suit their needs better, but it'll be on a where useful basis, rather than driven by the need to label stuff.\n\nUnsure if we'll add these tags into the search bar or not, we're still talking about that. \n\nSkirmishers is one of the names we've considered, concern we ran into was that it's a very general term. Doesn't tell you much about the sub class in question, in contrast to Diver or Juggernaut for example, and could just as easily apply to someone like Kayle, Teemo, Nidalee or Quinn. \n\nWe think juggernaut's probably the closest description for Shyvana because damage output, and ability to kill enemy champions herself, is a really core part of her identity. She's happy soaking some damage certainly, but she's not there primarily to set up/enable her team. Gragas and Cho we've been looking at as tank/mage combinations, Trundle as tank (though he's definitely got some juggenaut characteristics and doesn't fit the tank mold that cleanly), J4 as diver or tank (definitely not a juggernaut given the amount of mobility on his kit).","replies":[{"poster":"Teridax68","date":"2015-08-08T23:11:00.296+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Perhaps this might be a tad too fancy, but would the term \"Blade dancer\" work? Pretty much every light fighter (e.g. {{champion:11}}, {{champion:157}}, {{champion:114}}, {{champion:23}}, {{champion:92}} probably counts) uses a sword, and as you mentioned their survivability relies on key moments of situational and skill-dependent defense and powerful mobility. \"Melee carry\" is also commonly used, but the term \"carry\" tends to imply that these champions can singlehandedly win games for their team, when in fact they tend to be very dependent on their team's assistance to survive teamfights.\n\nAlso, by this classification, would {{champion:41}} qualify as a Juggernaut? He lacks the tools to close instantly on his target and makes up for it with a lot of damage and tankiness, which is a hallmark of Juggernauts, but his kit is also super-flexible in that he can also build far more damage than a typical Juggernaut and succeed, and he does possess a degree of ranged threat.
