So only by the third time **the same person** is brought up in the ridiculously slow Tribunal they are getting the same punishment as they do now when they are caught the first time.\n\nSo without manual reviews by Rioters (which are still present in the current system) a troll account could easily be active for months without there even being a serious punishment.\nEven if we assume that the Tribunal was better at catching trolls, Tribunal was simply too slow to be considered effective for anything.","replies":[{"poster":"KVbqbFsC8e","date":"2017-01-02T21:46:21.260+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Because an automated system cannot tell if someone is trolling.

But that's an entirely different subject. The automated system sees more context. Period.\n\nWhat you are arguing is whether it can **understand** that context. And that is precisely what Riot is working on. Making the system understand all those patterns is difficult, but with today's technology it's far from impossible.\nI mean, it's obviously not impossible, given that it is currently already being used to detect feeders. It's not particularly good at it yet, but it's obvious that it's generally capable of identifying certain contexts that constitute feeding. Now all Riot has to do is teach it more and more patterns.","replies":[{"poster":"KVbqbFsC8e","date":"2017-01-03T03:42:48.135+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I never said the Tribunal was perfect at catching everything, what I said is that its more effective than the automated system, and that is true.  You can get a much better picture as to whats happening in a game with a full chatlog of all players.

Due to how slow Tribunal is working I could call it \"entirely ineffective\" as well... Throwing exaggeration leads nowhere.\nTribunal caught feeders and trolls.\nThe current system catches feeders and trolls.\n\nAssuming which of the two is more effective is mostly guesswork. But what's undeniable is that the potential of an automated system is much much higher; **because** that system can very easily be given access to literally all information about a game.\n\nYou can't see whether somebody spammed the laugh emote after placing an anivia wall that doomed the team. You also can't see the exact placement of that wall. You cannot see timing of the wall, and how likely it is that it was an accident. Hell, you cannot even see that the wall happened and that it did, in fact, doom the team.\nBottom line: If an Anivia trolls her team via icewalls, but only once, maybe twice, and doesn't announce it as a troll move, Tribunal literally can't detect it. An automated system could.\n\nGiving all this information to Tribunal is virtually impossible, and for most cases it would add a massive amount of irrelevant information, which would unnecessarily complicate cases and lead to an even larger backlog.","replies":[{"poster":"KVbqbFsC8e","date":"2017-01-03T21:02:47.654+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"The automated system does not use a full chatlog. Its only looks at specifically what the person being reported typed.  And when it comes to feeding/trolling, it is ineffective. You can see multiple examples of that on the front page of this board. Sure, theoretically the automated system could be made to see if people are trolling.\n\nBut as of now, it doesn't. I wasn't going by \"what ifs\" when I said the Tribunal was better at catching trolls/feeders. Compare the automated system we have now, not what you think it will be made into in the future, to the Tribunal.","replies":[{"poster":"TrulyBland","date":"2017-01-03T21:57:20.058+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">The automated system does not use a full chatlog. \n\nFirst off: Citation needed.\nSecondly: So what? You were talking about context being available, not being used. Other peoples' chat was ignored by Tribunal users most of the time as well. It's also been since made very clear by Riot and by the community whenever the subject comes up, that while context generally matters, the specific context of \"who started it\" or \"who was worse\" does not.\n\n>And when it comes to feeding/trolling, it is ineffective.\n\nYou keep saying that but you're not actually backing it up with anything substantial. The only thing you are backing it up with so far is that there are still examples of feeders that are not caught despite being very obvious in it.\nBut those examples were pulled back in the days of Tribunal as well, because again: It was slow as fuck. The feeders of today were not caught until months later, if at all, because Tribunal always only used recent games to create the cases. So if somebody was feeding their ass off for a few days, and then never again, chances are they would get away with it.\n\nTribunal had basically the same flaws the current system has, just for different reasons and with a bunch of additional flaws.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"bk Tiger","date":"2017-01-02T17:30:22.966+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"still with chat related offenses....","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"eufleuria","date":"2017-01-02T17:49:24.945+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">Didn&#x27;t tell anyone to get cancer or kill themselves. No racial slurs.\n\nSwearing and telling people to die isnt the only way to get someone banned. This dude was griefing his teammates and harassing them about their gameplay. He was overly aggressive in chat.\n\nInstead of all of that complaining he did, he couldve worried about himself and tried to focus on ways to winning the game.\n\nAnd I dont even see anything about comparing stats. All he did was using their \"stats\" against them to make himself feel better by putting them down for it. Stats dont mean anything if you cant win by being a good sport.","replies":[]},{"poster":"wtf is tht dmg","date":"2016-12-29T23:05:07.966+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"permabanned for talking too much nice bro ROFLLL","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"YerroFever","date":"2017-01-03T15:34:09.196+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1)  You control YOUR league actions. Don't make it so that YOUR actions negatively affect other people. \n\n2) Don't compare yourself to other people and state that you're doing better than someone else because you're actually passive aggressively insulting your teammate. You're saying \"well at least I'm not a big of a mess up as that person\" even though you may not explicitly say that another person is a mess up, you imply it by your comparison and your attempt to deflect and redirect negative comments from your teammates to another person. If you messed up, own it, learn from it. No one is perfect. \n\n3) Ask for MIA calls if they're missing or ask for ganks if you need help. Don't insult your teammates directly or indirectly by comparing how you die or comparing how your enemy team is doing better than your team. \n\n4) Negatively comparing and/or insulting your teammates rather than giving constructive criticism or non-insult based suggestions, typically leads to them basically hating you as a league player... which also means, they're more likely to save their life saving skills/summoners on teammates that they do like more than you... which most likely is the reason you're experiencing such a negative league game.\n\n5) You have a lot of control over your own league experience and there are things you can do to limit your negative experiences in league. Unfortunately, you can't stop all of the negative experiences but you can put someone on ignore. If they're ruining the game and making it unwinnable (as we know one player can cause a team to lose if the remaining four aren't on the same wavelength), resolve on just having fun and/or turn the game into a mechanics practice. \n\n6) You also seem to need to stop typing in game because you can't seem to control your anger towards others in game. If needed, just put everyone on ignore and do your best in the game, end game, block everyone you didn't like, and move on. What's the point of picking online fights? No one cares about your epeen except you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"swordofsun","date":"2016-12-30T20:43:19.276+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You must've just had the 14-day ban.
