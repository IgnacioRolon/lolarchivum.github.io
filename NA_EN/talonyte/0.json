After my two chat restrictions, I reformed for 9 months. And I got full honor. Suddenly one game, I say bad a couple of times, noob also, because a feeding alistar in ranked was spam pinging me and saying way worse things. So it was supposed to go back to chat restriction cause I reformed, but it went to temp....??? Then eventually I got a perma. I never say anything worse than trash, and I rarely say that. just noob and bad sometimes. I don't know how saying bad and noob a couple of times skips my reform?? it was an error to ban me because I wasn't reported for 9 months and reform is a thing but I guess its bugged. I lost my level 210 account that I spent two years on and hundreds of dollars to an error in reform. Each time I go to riot support, they say that it \"wasn't an error\" but they don't even explain why. And it wasn't an error anyways sooo","replies":[{"poster":"Imperial Pandaa","date":"2019-07-19T19:24:00.060+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Logs could help identify what lead to punishment this time.\n\nAs for the past, 9 months doesn't actually tell us anything.
