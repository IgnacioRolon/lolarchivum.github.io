The only part of her that made her nonviable wasn't her kit. Her passive was considered anywhere between the 2nd to top 10 depending on what site you looked at. it was her mana regen/ cost of her spells that made people rage people for playing her. Unless you insta killed Karma quickly went oom and became a super minion. That and it was easy for her to take cs with her support skills if she was careless, but thats a player awareness problem not a champ problem. I jungled her back when only junglers like noc or fiddles took blue lvl 1 without a leash, and karma could do it, but even with the blue buff, she would run out of mana on wolves, the second camp. Her mana pool was stupid nonviable early game. Also I don't know why you say her kit is uninteresting or non cohesive. Its more cohesive than the current kit. Her q went from a damage ability with a mantra'd heal to a damage ability with a mantra'd nuke. her shield went from the strongest in the game to one that is mostly utility unless mantra'd. Her link, while offering some small utility, now is there for her survive ability mantra'd. The old leash was a speed buff/debuff for all who crossed the leash and the leashed targets, and only did damage if it hit an enemy who wasn't a leashed target. Much more utility oriented. The new karma's kit feels so much less like a support and instead a weird hybrid of support/carry that I feel isn't enough of either to be effect after lane, though I have definitely seen it work so I realize that it is just my opinion. All being said, I was never a karma main, but she was my favorite niche support and I would love to see the old one back.

They literally don't exist anymore. It's just Zyra Malz Brand every game I'm in who top the damage charts don't build a sightstone and steamroll the game. Quarantine supports so we can have a fair game, not get instantly destroyed at 5 minutes cause there's tons of AOE and no reason why not to take them support","replies":[{"poster":"The Rogue Blade","date":"2017-02-16T21:53:29.435+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"A couple years ago, Supports where the first class update and the role itself was re-done. Was when they changed the wards around, like making it so you can only hold 3 wards and 1 pink ward out at a time. They changed the way supports received exp and also introduced the support gold generating items and more interactive items for them as well.  I do agree that the role and some of the champs need a overhaul again, but most likely they will go through the classes that have not received a class rework yet.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Valor Bot","date":"2017-02-16T08:03:24.810+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Aside from divers, are there any other strong contenders for the end of year class update?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wobly","date":"2017-02-16T19:00:37.375+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Any thoughts on what happens to the Roster Update team after the Diver update? At that point you'll have updated every class except Skirmishers (who could use some work admittedly) and Controllers, who seem in a pretty good spot.
