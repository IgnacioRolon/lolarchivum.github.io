It's annoying having to spend 10 min until you actually enter the queue. For a matter of fact im waiting right now. I have a picture showing the FPS and info.","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-05-09T22:12:20.349+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Does this consistently happen in every single game, such as loading into a Custom Game?  Or did this seem to be an issue only for this one particular game?  While I can't remove the LPQ at all, I could help to make sure it doesn't happen again!\n\nReply back and let me know!","replies":[{"poster":"killerbeast873","date":"2016-08-06T11:14:04.403+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello, I used to play LoL like a year ago and i remember being disconnected 3 times and receiving low priority cue (thats why i left the game) and after a year i come back to the game and now i have a 30 min cooldown before everygame. Im just saying this low priority thing is very bad and you may lose alot of players. If you want to keep it atleast do something like 0min or 5 but 20 and 30 is alot. As well as waiting for 30min you have a game that goes on for more than a hour so people like me who have a busy schedule wont be able to play the game","replies":[]}]}]}
