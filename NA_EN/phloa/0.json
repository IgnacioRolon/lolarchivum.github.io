Adding warm colors makes it a lot more visually appealing IMO. But the thing is, I don't know how I feel about the gold added into the in-game skin. It's kinda meh for me because it was hard to make the cloth on his waist not stand out since the metal in the original is the same color, if you notice I even tried changed the tint a touch. What do you guys think?\n\n\nOriginal snap shots credit to surrenderat20.net","replies":[{"poster":"IronwallJackson","date":"2017-01-12T00:47:32.004+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"The warm color doesn't line up with the rest of the pallet, hombre. It doesn't exactly clash, but it contrasts way too strongly with the rest of his colors and draws the eye enough to turn an unimportant detail into a major focal point of the skin. If the rest of Tundra WW's color scheme wasn't made up entirely of cold, saturated colors, then yeah, gold might work, but not like this.","replies":[{"poster":"Phloa","date":"2017-01-12T01:15:59.420+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Are you saying that the addition of the saturated blues to the reworked skin made it harder to add warm colors without having them unnecessarily stand out... wait, I realized that's exactly why it was bothering me while typing that!!!!!!!!!!!  lol","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"warmcorntortilla","date":"2017-01-12T22:40:30.111+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think your edit looks a lot better, honestly. The other one is so muted, you'd barely be able to see it amongst the particle effects and other whatnot that happens on the rift. If you want visual clarity, you need contrasting colors. The blue and gold look great together, and I think it's a needed change once again just to see it in-game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Grimm Howl","date":"2017-01-12T10:27:50.906+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know the original texture of Tundra Hunter before the texture pass update that is now on live wasn't the greatest, but when they changed is from the dull silvery-brass to the gold that is live. It didn't sit well with me personally. I enjoyed the cool muted tones, and felt the gold armor deserved to stay on his base model, not add it to his skin that was just a recolor anyways.","replies":[]},{"poster":"VivaLaKitten","date":"2017-01-12T01:19:32.234+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I like it","replies":[]},{"poster":"KoggyStyle","date":"2017-01-12T08:12:46.976+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the ebony before TU was best......","replies":[]}]}
