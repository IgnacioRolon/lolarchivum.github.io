I play differently based on the situation, sometimes you can completely zone them, sometimes you have to turret farm all game. Just depends on the champions being played. After lane phase ends, much of where I go and what I do is determined by the shot caller. In solo queue, I usually push my lane out, group and try to take turrets and get objectives throughout the map.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Xtronick","date":"2015-04-25T06:06:23.037+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Application:\nCurrent Rank(CR) Highest Rank(HR): plat 3, decayed to gold 1 because I was on holidays.

Be honest, during lane phase and after lane phase, elaborate if you can: I like farm out and play cautiously until our lanes has an advantage (Allied jungler attention, numbers advantage, hitting a level/item powerspike) utilizing my knowledge of wave control to keep the minions on our side of the river without having them crash into the tower, whittling the enemy lane down with poke and maintaining a CS advantage until we have the ability to secure a kill. If we take a sizable lane advantage, I like pressing the enemy duo away from their lane and assuredly starving them out on CS & experience rather than going hard and potentially giving up kills and or pressure to equalize the lane back out. After lane, I prefer objective based play over solo farming.","replies":[]},{"poster":"wiiplayer","date":"2015-04-24T22:17:43.716+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ok so im gold 3 my highest was gold 1 and i play Jinx graves cait draven and ez. i have skype and  i meet the requirmets i can atend practice and i can get alot of farm.
