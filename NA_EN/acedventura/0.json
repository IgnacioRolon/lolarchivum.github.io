A possible solution??","subforum":"Player Behavior","up_votes":4,"down_votes":12,"body":"Okay I know everyone has heard this a billion times but I&#039;m sure many people know the struggle of climbing up the ranks. \r\n\r\nMy concern is the amount of people that add a negative experience to the game, eg (feeding, toxic, giving up etc)\r\n\r\nI know there is a system in place to report players but does that really stop them unless a bunch of players are using it, even more so, are they learning anything?\r\n\r\n**The Solution  **\r\n\r\nIntroduce a performance system, for example if you do well in game you dont lose as much lp and or cant be demoted. For example you should get more lp for doing really well in a game (carrying) instead of just getting lp according to you mmr. \r\n\r\nThe game tracks your performance in game and if you&#039;re feeding too much you get a temporary ban from ranked.\r\n\r\nMake losing streaks less stressful.. okay if you losing because you&#039;re feeding your arse off.. okay demote them to wood but if you loss three in a row just because you&#039;re team is feeding, someone dcs etc then you should be losing less lp or at least have a demotion shield. Some/all my ideas should be tested in lower elo where the problem is far more pronounced. \r\n\r\n**Remake**\r\nThe person that caused the remake should loss 9lp which is donated to the unlucky 9 that had their time wasted  (1 each).\r\n\r\n**Block a player **\r\n\r\nYou should be able to stop yourself from being paired with toxic player by blocking them, i dont remember how many times I&#039;ve been qued with the same toxic players from a previous game. \r\n\r\n**The reason why this is such a problem**\r\n\r\nYou&#039;re promoting people to carry bad players. Half the time a smurf is playing and carrying people that shouldn&#039;t even be winning. So the game encourages people to want to get someone to boast... which consequently makes the problem worse because then people arent even in their own elo. Also from what i said earlier if you lose a bunch when you&#039;re almost carrying and then get demoted, you&#039;re following the people that got you there in the first place. So is that really what the goal should be?\r\n\r\nThese are just a few of my ideas, I have so much more and I really hope someone from riot sees this and could maybe add their opinion on the problem.****","replies":[{"poster":"Ulanopo","date":"2017-02-18T01:41:18.434+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":">The game tracks your performance in game and if you're feeding too much you get a temporary ban from ranked.\n\nThis won't work.

A disconnect may not be your fault but your team is paying for it. Especially if its not in the remake time period. So there should be some kind of dynamic LP system that causes your team to either lose less to no LP.","replies":[{"poster":"Ulanopo","date":"2017-02-19T04:31:43.443+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=twichtvBootysama,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=fsFGV5ZJ,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2017-02-18T23:19:50.211+0000)\n>\n> Ehh..

Another problem its just a bad game, or you understood you don't wanna play today anymore right after champion select ended and being afk is no good eather. Your jngler just didn't helped your lane despite there we're tons of opportunities for him to do that AND he was near your lane. For bottom lane all it takes for 1 player to be a fuckup and entire lane wents to shit. So real problem of feeding is not how to punish those people, but how to prevent them from doing that.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jinx BÃ²t","date":"2017-02-19T16:05:44.001+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel like you wrote this after a bad couple of games.

The process of banning feeders wouldn't increase the speed at which you climb (or drop), and it actually rewards teams that play smartly and manage to either convince the feeder to play safer or be less toxic, or can find a way to play around them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Snow Aisaka","date":"2017-02-18T01:09:17.563+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"so if someone is having a bad game and dies like 13 times you want them to be banned? or if someone is having a bad game then me as an ADC gets 1 shotted every time i spawn i get banned from playing ranked because someone else fed? think you need to rethink your ideas.","replies":[{"poster":"AcedVentura","date":"2017-02-18T02:22:54.981+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"If they do it like 3, 4, 5  games in row then yes at least have them go back to norms.
