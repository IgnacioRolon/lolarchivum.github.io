The thing is, the client is downloading like 14GB when I remember in the legacy client it used to be like 5 or 6 GB. Whats going on? And worse, there is no way to pause the download as 14GB is way over my daily download limit of 5Gb (Damned isp ...).\r\n\r\nIs this a UI bug or something?","replies":[{"poster":"ScarletStudy","date":"2017-05-22T04:28:44.779+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just remembered that diablo 3 had a 15GB download, in-comparison league does not seem to require downloading as many files as diablo needs. At the very least the 15GB download needs to be compressed (7.5 or 8GB) or have a a pause feature.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ELmajek King","date":"2017-12-16T18:04:46.108+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So I had gone over 3 GB then it stopped.

That really sucks that your ISP caps your daily download limit, and like you said we don't have a way to pause that download yet. I know it's not really the best solution, but the most I could suggest right now is to maybe try downloading the game at a friends house/pc cafe or something similar =\\ .","replies":[{"poster":"ScarletStudy","date":"2017-06-19T14:31:53.510+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Broporo,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=XyUOH1mj,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2017-05-22T20:45:45.163+0000)\n>\n> Over the years, League has been adding new features like new champions/skins/wards/etc. Naturally, the size of the installation has grown as well.
