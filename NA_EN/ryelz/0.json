At first we thought it was our connection but that isn't the case since everything else on our network works perfectly fine and a speed test confirmed that. We were in one of my promo games and there were constant animation lags for us. For example, I'd hit Q and then 2 seconds later I'd see it show up. When a team fight would start everyone would pause and then jump around as if it was ping lag, but my ping did not move from 59 so it didn't seem like it was a ping related issue, which is why I'm calling it \"animation lags\". So I decided to reset my client to see if that'd work and now I can't even log into it (Lost the promo game because of it obviously). It stays on the \"authenticating\" phase and doesn't move. Any ideas what this is?","replies":[{"poster":"DaRkViRuS","date":"2017-06-13T22:35:29.392+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Porocles,\n\nI am also experiencing a lot of lag.

Something wrong with their pairing to Riot?\n\nEdit: It seems to be slowly improving, now around 100ms.

Something definitely looks odd reaching riot direct.  There could be a peering issue with your ISP getting to the game server, so I recommend calling them to see what's up.  If you like, you can also hit us up in a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and our tech team could help get some logs to send over to them as well.

Specifically, this sounds like you've got some packet loss that's degraded to a total inability to connect.  It sucks that this cost a promo, and I want to help!  You guys should both go through each step of the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to help fix this up.
