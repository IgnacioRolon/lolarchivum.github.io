I didn't believe it at first, but now that I see that animation on the rift, I feel like it maybe true. Especially since we've seen teasers for many of the new champions before they were announced.........Anyone else noticed it?","replies":[{"poster":"Zach Sandwhich","date":"2017-01-08T04:52:00.323+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah no.

It just seems weird to me that they'd tease two things at once since one is clearly going to be overshadowed by the other in most cases. Also kinda weird that its not a new support (Unless its a lighting support or something) since we havent had a new support in forever.","replies":[{"poster":"Arakadia","date":"2017-01-10T00:49:36.567+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree incompletely.

I also highly doubt any new champion is going to be lighting theme'd since thats sort of Kennens thing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"HotshotGrim","date":"2017-01-10T09:18:31.004+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I 100% guarantee that it's not edited in. You can go to Jensen's stream on twitch from a couple of days ago and you'll see it. I took it from there. Also it did happen quite a few times in many of my games as well. It could however still be a bug. It's just that the leaked artwork of a lightning champ and this so called repetitive bug came so in sync with each other that I couldn't write it off as just some coincidence.
