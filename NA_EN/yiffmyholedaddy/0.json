I can&#039;t really provide footage of this as it&#039;s literally just &quot;the volume is quieter&quot; but most people I&#039;ve spoken to are also seeing this occur. To reproduce it just go into a practice tool and use some spells. I&#039;ve experienced it on Slay Belle and Warring Kingdoms, although someone I spoke to tried it on PROJECT and said it also had muffled noises. I will admit I&#039;ve yet to test it with base spells effects. I've tested this on multiple volumes and it remained consistently quiet than what is normally expected. It was at the point where the _enemy's_ spells were louder than mine, extremely noticably so at that. \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqeYY1Ei-QM\n\nI uploaded a video demonstrating this in action. Take note of just how loud everything else sounds compared to Katarina. She is noticably quieter than every other audio queue.

It's really quiet compared to any other Abilities so it's hard to hear it especially on Teamfights.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2017-10-27T22:15:54.762+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think one is planned, but I can follow up.","replies":[]},{"poster":"YuGiHo","date":"2017-10-27T21:54:38.370+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"its kinda cool, for this one patch kat is going to be this assassin that silently kills teams","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Muskiller","date":"2017-10-28T00:34:16.952+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"is the death Sworn going to stay silent my friend really likes how its quiet.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2017-10-30T21:04:45.257+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nah, the sounds for all skins and base will go back to being consistent/how they were prior to patch 7.21 when the next patch (7.22) goes live.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"CJPwnz","date":"2017-10-26T05:42:55.757+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I used Kitty Cat Katarina and that skin also had muffled sounds.
