This box really bothers me, and it sometimes interferes with my farm, since I can't correctly gauge the hp of the minion.\r\nIt's even worse when my cursor goes over huge characters, because at that point, the character box just blocks the damn screen.\r\nAn example for that case would be with Baron: whenever my cursor goes over Baron, his character box covers the entire pit, and I can't see anything.\r\nDoes anyone else have this problem? Can I fix this?","replies":[]}
