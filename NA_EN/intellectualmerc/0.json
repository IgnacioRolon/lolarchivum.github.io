I&#039;ve been playing League for about 3 years now and it has become my go-to competitive game for quite a while. I&#039;ve never made a post in the community boards (though I have read a lot of threads here). However, after what has just happened, I felt I needed to post in order to try and get some answers.\n\nI went to log into my account this morning and got a notification that it has been permanently banned and that an email with more information had been sent to my email. I have received no such email and do not understand why I have been banned. \n\nTo pre-answer some questions, I have never received either a warning or a suspension before. I am not usually toxic (but let&#039;s all admit we have the occasion game where we are). Usually I am just talkative and try to be fun with my team/the opponents. I had high honors with the old system and don&#039;t use any 3rd party software to cheat.\n\nI am worried that this may have happened due to previous opponent threatening to &quot;dox&quot; my account, as I do not know of any reason for Riot to suspend me. If there is a reason, please explain to me so that I can understand why I have been permanently banned.\n\nI really believe that I do not deserve to be banned and I would love to continue playing league. But if this suspension stands, I don&#039;t know if I can start over again with a new account. The amount of skins (not a lot, but still) and particularly the experience with my champs after 3 years would be so disheartening to try and rebuild.\n\nPlease, if anyone can help me understand or give me tips on what to do, I would really appreciate it.\n\n*EDIT:*   Yes, I have created a support ticket. Hoping I hear back from them soon...\n\n\n**UPDATE 1:** Due to what you have been saying, I went back and checked my account out. The email listed is still mine. I also changed my password and the email notifying me went to the correct account. So I at least know that I can still get into my account and now that I've changed the password others probably can't get in. Still don't know what the issue is though.\n\n**UPDATE 2:** Riot has recently posted below to let me know that this was a protective ban to prevent my account from being compromised. Thank you for the post mod. Looks like I just need to wait for my ticket to be answered. Sucks that I've missed on playing for (at least) 2 days. But hopefully they respond soon and I can get back to it.\n\nThank you again to everyone who posted here. It's really great to know that there is a solid community outside of the game as well as inside.","replies":[{"poster":"PlsTouchMeGently","date":"2017-07-27T16:32:01.955+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll upvote you, but I'm used to people like you not telling the entire truth.

If you look at the IP addresses from each login its pretty simple to see that two different computers had access to the account.
