My pc (Screen) turns black, and is marked \"No signal\" I tried to update my drivers, change the resolution of the game compared to my screen but nothing works. I'm on a TV screen and not on a PC screen but before the game started normally. The other games like Cs go, Rambow six walk very well.\r\nHow to do ? It is impossible for me to play Lol at the moment.\r\nDraftClubFr.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-24T05:12:21.226+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're likely experiencing an issue with the fullscreen resolution that League is trying to run at. I suggest hitting **ALT+ENTER** once you see the loading screen pop up, which should toggle you in a different video mode and resolve this, if the issue was in full screen.\n\nLet me know if this worked.","replies":[]}]}
