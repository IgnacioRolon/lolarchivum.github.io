It's one thing for him to be immune to the initial Tibbers summon damage (where Annie could be argued to be the \"source\" of the damage), but once Tibbers is summoned, aside from tower aggro considerations, Tibbers is the \"source\" of his own AOE damage and autoattacks.\r\n\r\nIs this intended, an oversight, or a result of somehow using the tower aggro system (which is presumably there so an Annie can't towerdive solo without taking aggro on herself) to calculate where a damage \"source\" is?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-22T21:26:23.838+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think this *might* be working correctly. It first seems like he should be hit by Tibbers but not Annie, but since all of Tibbers damage is considered to be Annie's damage everywhere else (EoG screen, death recaps too I think but correct me if I'm wrong) he's still immune when Annie is outside the circle.\n\nIf you want some extra confirmation or to go ahead and draw some attention to it, go ahead and post this over in Report a Bug as a *possible bug, need clarification*.","replies":[{"poster":"RabbitQueenRemi","date":"2017-10-25T04:59:21.549+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks muchly!
