So to answer your question, the boarders were made with the intent to be a limited time thing and never return, if they did then Riot would need to comp everyone who already owns them by giving them something exclusive in return other than just extra rp; therefore 99.99% sure they will never be re-released.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
