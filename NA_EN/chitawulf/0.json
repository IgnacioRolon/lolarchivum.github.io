Then you noticed that your blue was gone and that the enemy Kayn took it. Which means he had the oppurtunity to place a deep ward and you want to make sure he doesn't have that vision on your jungle. You place a control ward and voila! Turns out he did place a ward there. But what happens to the control ward you placed previously over dragon? Does it dissapear? Does the vision stay but the enemy ward becomes unsilenced? What happens to a control ward after you place another one?","replies":[{"poster":"LordRedStone Nr1","date":"2019-06-22T22:17:54.972+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It disappears and the effects it had disappear too.\nThat means disabled wards become enabled again, and you lose the vision it provided.\n\nYou can also use that to troll enemies, namely when they are about to clear one of your pinks you just drop another one anywhere, hopefully somewhere safe. It will disappear right before their eyes xD","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kai Guy","date":"2019-06-22T21:04:48.823+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">  Does it dissapear? \n\nYes. Just like when you place normal wards over 3. {{item:3363}}  I is the only one with no cap.  But let me check just incase its got a soft cap. Will edit after a test.\n\nEdit 1. To answer specefics. the vision you had is gone. Any wards it was blocking vision on will regain vision.\nEdit 2. {{item:3363}}  have a cap of 10.\n","replies":[{"poster":"ChitaWulf","date":"2019-06-22T22:45:08.197+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh, so normal wards and farsight also have caps? I had no idea. I thought all normal wards disappeared after an interval, not after 3. Does that mean the first three wards you place are permanent?","replies":[{"poster":"Kai Guy","date":"2019-06-22T22:52:22.569+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Take a look at the tooltip on items. {{item:3361}}  It shows both duration as well as the limit. Same for support items. {{item:2055}}  You can check them on the boards by using the greyed out Doran's ring icon that shows up when your commenting.\n\nEdit. Sorry did not give a direct reply to your question. Fixing that. No. Yellow wards have a duration, they do not last forever.  Zombie wards and ghost Poros also have durations But Blue and Red wards do not.\n\nAlso a funny Easter egg. A control ward that lives long enough gets a buff. click on the ward and look for a buff icon on the top left under its stats after 5 min or so.\n\nAre you new-ish to league or Mobas?\n\nIf yes then hit me up if you need some assistance with mechanics or learning the game.  The lol wiki is helpful to learn but you sometimes need to know what your looking for first.","replies":[{"poster":"ChitaWulf","date":"2019-06-23T07:00:38.744+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for your detailed response! I didn't know that you could look up items on the forums. And yeah, league is my first moba and I've been playing for two weeks now. I don't know how I can contact you on the forums so I'll just ask here. \n\nI was watching this video from 2016:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fESqRJo8tjs\n\nAnd this Bronze Trynd tried to ult then teleport while in undying rage, and that's a strat I've thought about before. I main Kindred, and I want to know if it's been changed since 2016 where being attacked and/or damaged while teleporting takes you out of it. I'm thinking instead of having flash I could use ult + teleport (since teleport is 3.5 and lamb's respite lasts for 4 seconds) as a way to escape as flashing after lamb's respite ends usually ends up in me dying and wasting my flash and ult. With teleport I could teleport to a ward on the other side of the map, farm jungle to recover hp and mana, then promptly gank on the other side of the map. Also does teleport get interrupted by cc like roots and stuns and fleeing? Usually cc in lamb's respite spells my doom anyway, but I'm just curious. Also do abilities like Urgot's ult, Alistair headbutt, Poppy ult, Pyke/Blitz/Thresh, Yasuo tornado thing, Kayn and Sion's thingies that make you airborne, etc. interrupt teleport?","replies":[{"poster":"Kai Guy","date":"2019-06-23T08:48:13.244+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To get some ones attention You basically have to reply to a comment.\n\n\nTeleport is not stopped by normal damage or Soft CC (slows). Hard CC will. Here is the page where you can find details on Teleport. https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Teleport\n\nNow personally, I recommend using Flash over TP when your new. You can try some off meta builds and do well, but you need to have a good grasp on all champions kits to know interactions.\n\n For the abilitys your asking about Urgot R will not end TP unless your HP is low enough he can reactivate it. The first casts is fine. The second is going to stop the ability. Also as far as the second cast goes.  If he is outside of Kindred R you die. If he is inside kindred R you live.  Kayne Does not have hard CC unless he goes Rhasst. (red).  In that form he can stop teleport. However in all 3 forms of kayne if he casts his R on you at the correct time he will travel with the Teleport.\n\nEverything else your asking about will cancel TP.\n\nWhen your very new. I recommend you try all free week heroes VS AI bots for a game or two. That way you learn what they do and don't have to find out the hard way by playing with or VS them. Reading is fine, but hands on experience tends to teach lessons faster.\n\nThe game has a lot of champions in it to help teach mechanics to new players.\n\nMacro is important. Vision is HELLA important. A lot of players treat Mobas like FPS and go after kills. In my opinion The only thing you should care about is whos nexus goes BOOM! And what you can do to make that happen.\n\nIf skill shots are giving you a hard time. Try spending a few weeks playing Battlerite on steam. That game is free and has almost no macro so you can get a good feel for Micro skill shot gameplay.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-06-23T09:27:28.409+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just out of curiosity, did you try loading up Practice Tool, buying two Control Wards, and then placing both of them?","replies":[]}]}
