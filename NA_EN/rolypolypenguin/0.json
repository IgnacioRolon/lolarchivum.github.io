(ive tried everything posted on the forums with no success.) but every once in a while the game downloads at like 100-300 kbps so I wait for it and at that point every time it gets to 50% it crashes and I have to restart at 0%, I have tried uninstalling and redownloading the installer, ive tried turning my firewall of and I even did an entire hard drive wipe and after, still no change. I just want to play the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-22T20:34:14.863+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Patching issues at this point in the process are usually caused by the patcher not being able to maintain a good connection to the patching servers.
