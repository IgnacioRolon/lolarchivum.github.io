My issue is I have been loosing control of my character during matchs since about three days ago. My character will run of in the direction of the last input I gave it and I can't move away or use any abilitys. This as first only lasted at best of 30 seconds and I could re-synce? without an issue but the last three games i played I have to manually close the game and reopen to get a chance of being able to play again. \r\n\r\nSome things of note, my ping doesn't shoot up in these time and most of the time I can still see roughly what my team is/was doing including the chat log. If i  cannot reconnect I get like a loop of animation of everyone teleporting around the map. My character stays in the same animation he was in when i de-sync? For instance i was playing rammus and during the whole period I would be teleporting around in the power ball animation. At no point do i actually disconnect (but i might of well have been). I just seem to loose control of my character and he seeming follows the last input givin (like auto attcking someone) and have him chase all the way to the fountain. This is really concerning me because last game i played i have my team flaming me for inting during this period I lose control.\r\n\r\nI have looked around my computer for anything the sticks out like a sour thumb but I have very little experience dealing with computer software that I don't honestly know very well what im looking for. I am currently running a virus scan hoping that the problem is just a bug on my computer that could be snuffed out(i just feel like it isn't an internet issue). I will also be resetting my internet box.  I'm hoping a helpful person has experienced this before and knows exactly what i should do to fix my issue (as i have seen other forms describing this issue) Any input would very much be appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-07T22:40:44.050+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This sounds an awful lot like packet loss, especially when you mention that your champ will sometimes kind of ignore your command and continue running in the same direction. Basically what's happening is this: you click to have your champ move a different way, but for some reason that data doesn't make it all the way to our servers, so your champ never starts the new command. Most of the time it happens outside of your network along the way your ISP is routing your connection, but sometimes we can tweak a few things to help out.\n\nLet's run a quick test to be sure by using some network logs from one of those games and letting our [**log reader**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743) scan it. Hit me back up with a screenshot of the image it gives and we can go over it together.","replies":[{"poster":"Officer Zyra ","date":"2017-08-08T19:50:24.259+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://imgur.com/cH7mqbS","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Officer Zyra ","date":"2017-08-07T20:20:17.097+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/2566915627/227344809?tab=stats\n\nthis was the match my team tolled me I was inting","replies":[]}]}
