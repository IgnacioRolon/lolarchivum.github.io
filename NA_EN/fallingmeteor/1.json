Although, Galio should logically awaken due to the sudden spike of magic being used in the capital. Yet there's are a few possibilities to consider.\n\nFirst, and most important, Galio is actually housed outside of the capital on one of the main roads leading there. So he's simply too far away from the action to actually absorb enough magic to move.\n\nSecond, depends on where the mob of mages came from. I interpreted that they're all citizens born of the capital. Mages who weren't imprisoned and successfully kept their abilities a secret until Sylas sparked a rebellion.  If that is so, one would assume Galio has permanently been surrounded by the magic of mages naturally living in the area this whole time. If Lux alone could bring him to life, surely a quarter (more or less) of a city's population who're also mages could inadvertently do it too?\n\nThirdly, Galio can only awaken if magic is ACTUALLY being used/conjured in his vicinity. While citizens who have magical capabilities but aren't doing anything magical in the moment wouldn't necessarily awaken him. Explaining why the mage section of the capital's population could be around Galio at any given time, and he still couldn't move.\n\n ","replies":[]},{"poster":"Leadboo","date":"2019-09-09T20:33:57.951+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=lodcea,realm=EUNE,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=8WKhW6xX,comment-id=00000002,timestamp=2019-09-09T20:26:32.773+0000)\n>\n> but still how is {{champion:3}} still asleep?\n\nThat's a good point, His lore states he only awakens because of magic\nI assume he's being kept out of the story for now because they want more issues instead of, Bam, giant statue, problem solved.

Takes Sona to a place she's likely to have decent upbringing (the orphanage) before turning back into her instrument form.\n\nShe then tethers herself to Sona (making her mute in the process?) and acts as a discreet protector to the child until she's old enough to become a host but has a change of heart midway through, possibly due to the child's natural artistic disposition. Etwahl influences Sona into developing her artistic sense.\n\nLater, Lestara Buvelle (who i'd lore up to belong to either an artsy or historian family), visits Ionia post-Noxian invasion as a diplomat, hears of the child and her instrument, and recognizes the Etwahl for what it is. She immediately adopts Sona and brings her to Demacia, hiding her latent magic as well as actually teaching her how to play. Sona develops her talents to epic levels, and becomes a diva.\n\nThe result could be a Sona/Etwahl as beautifully interwoven as Kindred are.","replies":[{"poster":"GreenLore","date":"2019-09-10T18:06:53.852+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Honestly I'm not sure if Riot would be ready to add a second character to Sona as the champion.\nSure the past VGUs changed the characters quite a lot, but never have they added a second character to the champ.","replies":[{"poster":"GinoSoldier","date":"2019-09-10T18:49:15.679+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=GreenLore,realm=EUW,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=8WKhW6xX,comment-id=00050000000100000000000000000000,timestamp=2019-09-10T18:06:53.852+0000)\n>\n> Honestly I'm not sure if Riot would be ready to add a second character to Sona as the champion.\n> Sure the past VGUs changed the characters quite a lot, but never have they added a second character to the champ.\n\nIt's not like what she is right now even *is* a character.

However, if I'm not mistaken, I *think* it was said that Yordles might be able to make portals? It's all super fuzzy and even if they can, there are probably certain conditions in which they can make them and etc.","replies":[{"poster":"Doom emissary","date":"2019-09-10T20:17:28.091+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They definitely can !\n\nMy take on it was that it's something that takes preparation and time. They can't be made instantly on need (this is just my own understanding, it's not officially confirmed).\nSo since this is an urgent matter she'll have to run toward one already made in case of urgency, then go out of the closest one to the capital.\n\nFor Demacia's communication, there is a rebellion in the capital, they even took over the castle and many important places. So on top of all the chaos and confusion there, the officer's forces can't move as easily (mages will kill them or imprison them).\nDon't forget that with their current technology (mediaval age) and without magic (cause demacia), their only means of communication over long distances is to send a person on a horse or demacian raptors (big flying mounts) or send a message bird. So it's definitely not super efficient. Countries like Noxus can use magic and others like Piltover can use Hextech devices.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Soul Dealer","date":"2019-09-09T20:22:49.741+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As far as I know fiora is off fighting Jax on some bridge","replies":[]},{"poster":"NightFellow","date":"2019-09-10T03:50:21.851+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":1,"body":"There is Galio in the comic the 1st or 2d one I think","replies":[]},{"poster":"Galiö","date":"2019-09-10T18:24:08.059+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Xin was delivering a letter\nGalio had no signal/service\nQuinn and Valor had a fight and were resolving issues\nFiora was in the bathroom\nSona kept quiet\nShyvana went for a walk because she was upset about J4 possible plan to be married off to Lux\nVayne was out of ammo\nLucian was too depressed that day\nPoppy was trying to find help so someone can use he Hammer.","replies":[]},{"poster":"kagepaladin","date":"2019-09-10T06:15:53.797+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"you also forgot {{champion:37}} she maybe from an Ionian orphanage but she was adopted by Lestara Buvelle, who is a demacian noble.
