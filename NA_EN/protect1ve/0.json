( replying to me saying u dont have the right to report someone just for having 0-2) , so i told him yes because you are an arrogant %%%%, whats crazy is that i got a chat restriction only  because of one game , do you think i deserve that ? by the way i reported them both for flaming a new player and ofc nobody got any sort of restriction but apparently i did , i didnt know that saying %%%% or Bitch or something like that can be a valid reason for someone to get chat banned especially in literally one game ,and even if the answer is YES you deserve it , i respect that really, but what about the real one's who are ruining games ? seriously , isnt there a way to ban those who should be banned  , its like if you are smart enough you can literally ruin games avoiding specific words or trolling indirectly and still get away with it !   thanks anyway.{{sticker:sg-soraka}}","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-11-24T14:04:09.335+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"You weren't punished for misbehaving in one game. You were punished for misbehaving in _one more_ game, in a consistent pattern of negative behavior that breaks the game's rules. Additionally, the reform card doesn't always show all the logs that led to your punishment: it randomly selects up to several logs. You might see three logs, but you also might see as few as one, even for players whose punishment stems not from a small number of egregious infractions but rather from dozens of instances of mild toxicity. The purpose of the reform card is to tell you how to reform, so it shows you an example of the behavior that prompted your punishment and explains that such behavior is inappropriate and should be avoided if you want to maintain an account in good standing.\n\nIn a perfect and just world, everyone who deserved a punishment would get one. In reality, it is possible for some punishable behavior to go unpunished. First, punishments in LoL can only occur after a valid report. Second, punishments take into account the consistency and severity of the punished player's misbehavior: if two players in a match break the same rule in the same way, one who consistently misbehaves in this way might get a punishment while the other who almost never does so gets away without a punishment (this time). At the end of the day, though, all this does is explain how differences in player behavior over many games can produce different results for equivalent behavior within a single game. It doesn't excuse poor behavior. One person having a rare bad day doesn't give a consistently toxic player the right to join in. The only behavior that matters in your punishment is your own... and a good thing, too: how would you feel if you behaved yourself but got punished anyway just because all your teammates were spectacularly friendly, communicative, and positive?\n\nFrom [Riot's support knowledgebase](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/360025054153-Understanding-Your-Temporary-Account-Ban):\n\n> We can not discuss other playersâ€™ actions with you but you can always report them at end of game and mute them when in game. There is no excuse for raging back or responding to people trying to get you to tilt. You are the only one responsible for your actions and your words which is what we are trying to address with these bans.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Yin Yang Taoist","date":"2019-11-24T17:10:42.927+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"How do you know that they didn't get punished? And that's Riot's policy, yeah. Its only a level 7 account. Just make a new one. And next time, simply submit a ticket if they are being toxic without actually cussing.

I thought that's one of the zero tolerance word.  You probably should count yourself lucky it is only a chat restriction.  Normally any ZT word would get 14 days ban.","replies":[]}]}
