My ping jumps to 300+ (if I'm in loading screen for example I can watch it jump from green to 300+ numbers while its loading and this lag continues into the game).  As of downloading the most recent patch this morning I tried playing two games this afternoon and now that kind of lag is the happening the entire game.\n\nI doubt it's a connection issue on my end.  I've been playing league for over a year now.  I had a really good connection before the server move, and it's still pretty good, but I've never had this kind of lag before barring the \"reconnecting\" error from a few patches ago that seems to have been fixed at this point.\n\nIs anyone looking into this?  The game is currently unplayable for me.","replies":[{"poster":"Jeoh23","date":"2016-05-05T18:54:24.446+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same here.

I noticed my ping rise from a consistent ~42ms to a consistent ~88ms after the login issue presented itself at the end of last week.  Still having the same issue as of right now.  It's playable, but certainly something I'd want to fix if at all possible.  I've contacted my ISP and they've had no change in service status (which I kind of figured they would say anyway, since I have no real way of proving that statement) so I figured I would reach out to see if the issue is possibly not on my end.\n\nReally appreciate any guidance you could give!

The extremely frustrating part is that even spikes of 2-10 ms causes the game to lag as if you have 600 ping, which makes no sense.

It did not feel like it at all and because of it, sometimes I even felt like the number (ms) was frozen at 82 or 83. It felt like 200+ at times and I asked my friend if he felt slower or was lagging and he told me he was along with asking the enemy team. There were multiple times throughout the game where either I clicked to auto and then clicked to run immediately after to have my champion keep running to auto still or where my friend had dove a turret to clean up an easy kill but couldn't because he spiked underneath the tower and couldn't move or anything. I believe this is due to packet loss because as the user, if your ping doesn't change but you're lagging which means it is a server side problem and not a problem with your home internet connection. I also started to notice a few things weird with lag but were very subtle and didn't really have an impact on a game starting around Patch 6.6 unlike the problems I noticed after patch 6.9.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SkullsForKhorne","date":"2016-05-04T18:53:26.354+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same here.
