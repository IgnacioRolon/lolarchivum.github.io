Like the gruesome [assemblages of artist Alex CF](http://www.merrylinmuseum.com/index/) (icky, slightly NSFW).\n\nI imagine that a lot of the monster parts are mostly being used for very practical reasons - sea monster hide for clothing and armors.  They may even use them to create the watertight outer of smaller row-boats or canoes - all the better for dissuading smaller sea-creatures for attacking them!  \n\nMuch like Nashor's Tooth is an item, I'd suspect that teeth and claws and the like are used as tools and weapons down at the Slaughter Docks.  When slicing them up for parts, I imagine there are few tools better suited to cutting those hides than the very teeth of their competitors or predators.\n\nThat's not to say the more exotic items don't find enthusiastic buyers in the markets of Bilgewater and beyond.  I can imagine Zaunite scientists eager to see what splicing a deep sea monster's liver into a living surface dwelling creature might do.  I also imagine Piltover scientists (like Bubbs, the shopkeeper) are keen to categorize and study specimens - whether live (in Bubb's case) or preserved.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ebonmaw Dragon","date":"2015-07-28T19:51:43.783+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Dreamspitter,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=Gl5j5OtE,comment-id=,timestamp=2015-07-28T19:46:59.956+0000)\n> \n> * What sort of things do people use these sea monster organs for? \n> \n> * Does anyone like Janna want to make such products illegal to save the dragon-sharks from the Slaughter Fleet before they become an endangered species?\n\n1) Well, Mr {{champion:223}} has the answer for that...

Think rhino horns but from giant sea creatures.\n\nI could also imagine certain areas of Valoran prizing their organs in the use of all manner of concoctions, from alchemical substances to perfumes. Ever heard of ambergris folks? Like that.\n\nBilgewater itself would likely get a lot out of the creatures themselves; meat, hides, organs, bones, teeth, whatever they can get from their bodies could be used for food, equipment, medicine as described above, hell even building materials or ornaments. There's probably a few buildings in Bilgewater with a serpent mouth for an entry way, or with shark skulls hung up on the walls. While we can joke about this the Blue Flame Isles likely lack a ton of natural resources, so not only can the sea monsters provide but they could be traded for resources with other parts of the world. I'm sure there's been a fair number of pillocks from the mainland fooled by a silver tongued Bilgewater business man selling squid hearts and shark gall bladders.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SSJTribe","date":"2015-07-28T20:32:35.472+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"OP's pic reminded me of this Ziggs statue","replies":[]},{"poster":"2nd Fiddle","date":"2015-07-28T20:03:40.092+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:27}} \"I require certain _ingredients_ in large, consistent, and--most importantly--discrete, shipments.\"","replies":[]}]}
