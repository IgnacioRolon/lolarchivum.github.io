But this is the first time I've ever considered using it myself. Let's review...\n\nPassive: Slow every 3rd attack, and on champions includes a \"strong\" move speed buff\n\nQ: damage, slow\n\nW: passively basic attacks do bonus damage to low health targets, plus  an active which creates an aoe slow zone that detonates if he enters, granting him a shield and stunning all targets inside\n\nE: Initial dash, increased attack range, and targeted blink\n\nR: Rewinds time, becoming untargetable and invulnerable appearing where he was a few seconds ago, and regaining a portion of hp lost over those seconds....\"while dealing tons of damage to all nearby enemies\".\n\nOn an assassin. It SOUNDS like a lot of crowd control. But I supposed numbers will be everything here.\n\nEDIT: note here ult is actually a TINY bit disappointing considering it's depiction in the teaser. Many people expected, considering how replays are often done in these games to save space -that is literally \"recreating\" the game action by action from a small kilobytes sized file- that the game would not only record for replays but be able to support a character that could literally rewind game time  for EVERYONE enabling it to play out differently.  (That and we could finally get replays)","replies":[]}
