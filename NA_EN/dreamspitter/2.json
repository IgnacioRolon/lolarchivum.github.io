They are born from men and each sees the shades differently.&quot; \n\nSo what does Jhin believe in?\n\n&quot;I am avant-garde - you are stuck in the past.&quot; -{{champion:202}} \n\n>Much of the avant-garde theater developed in France from 1914-1939 can be seen as a revolt against tradition. \n\n&quot;The Noxian invasion should be a wake-up call. We need more elaborate productions.&quot;-{{champion:202}} \n\n>Deeply affected by the events of _World War I_, the artists of the movement felt increasing skepticism of the _existing societal structures_ that had allowed for _global warfare_.\n\n &quot;My theater is the mind.&quot;-{{champion:202}} \n\n>In his writings on the Theater of Cruelty, Artaud points to both &ldquo;theater&rdquo; and &ldquo;cruelty&rdquo; that are separate from their colloquial meanings. For Artaud, theater does not merely refer to a staged performance before a passive audience. The theater is a practice, which &ldquo;wakes us up. Nerves and heart,&rdquo; and through which we experience, &ldquo;_immediate violent action_,&rdquo; that &ldquo;inspires us with the fiery magnetism of its images and acts upon us like a spiritual therapeutics _whose touch can never be forgotten_.&rdquo;\n\n_At that moment, a town guard stumbled from the entrance, his face pale and hollow.\n&quot;Her flesh, it was... it was... &quot; he said. He took a few steps, then collapsed to the ground in shock.\n&quot;He saw it. He saw the flower!&quot; Against the far wall, the tavern&#039;s owner laughed. Then he began weeping - his face painted by madness.\nThese were not people who would forget seeing Khada Jhin&#039;s work._  -Golden Excellence, Jhin&#039;s color story\n\n&quot;Art requires a certain cruelty.&quot; -{{champion:202}}\n\n>According to scholar Nathan Gorelick, &ldquo;Cruelty is, more profoundly, the unrelenting agitation of a life that has become unnecessary, lazy, or removed from a compelling force. The Theater of Cruelty _gives expression to everything that is &lsquo;crime, love, war, or madness&rsquo;_ in order to &lsquo;unforgettably root within us the ideas of perpetual conflict, _a spasm in which life is continually lacerated,_ in which everything in creation rises up and asserts itself against our appointed rank.&rsquo;\n\n &quot;My genius will be understood - eventually.&quot; -{{champion:202}} \n\n>Artaud felt that the focus of theater in the west had become far too narrow&mdash;primarily examining the psychological suffering of individuals or the societal struggles of specific groups of people. He wanted to delve into the aspects of the subconscious that he believed were often the root cause of human being&rsquo;s mistreatment of one another.\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre_of_Cruelty\n\nCould it be that Jhin believes in a twisted form of the Artaud&#039;s Theater of Cruelty? And if so, was it drawn from other artists and philosophers of his time, or did he devise it himself? And if not, did the idea at least contribute to some of his development?","replies":[{"poster":"WAAARGHbobo","date":"2017-10-13T19:49:15.325+0000","up_votes":25,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well done!

He would've never started questioning Ionian society, philosophy and politics.  He would've never started seeing it for how backwards and archaic it truly is.  He would've never had a desire or a motivation to change any of it.  He'd probably just continue following the ways of the Kinkou Order in an effort to impress his father figure, much like Shen.\n\nAll in all, this really makes me wonder what he has in mind for Shen and Zed for his 'final masterpiece.'

Is he leading them on a trail to uncover something even greater?  Is there more to Ionia's society and political system then we know - perhaps it's truly corrupt at its core and their philosophies of \"peace\" and \"balance\" is just one giant public facade?  Better yet, what about Jhin himself?

It too sought balance and became complacent. There was slavery for example in the republic, and the Jedi Temple spent more of its resources just keeping itself propped up as a symbol. Anakin Skywalker was by prophecy said to finally bring 'balance' to the force. He brought the Dark Side that was missing to shake apart the order, humble, and diminish it. \n\nBut he failed. As things swung again out of balance fully to the Dark Side with the rise of the Empire. It was ultimately Anakin through his son, Luke who brought balance. Though The Last Jedi could have something to say about that.","replies":[]},{"poster":"HonestJohnTheCon","date":"2017-10-14T12:36:42.638+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It would have had to be at a young age, he mentions in his color story (or maybe bio) that he used to use blades from his father's martial arts training facility to make art rather than guns.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TyrekGoldenspear","date":"2017-10-13T22:30:25.589+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Phew, you get a cookie for that insight.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Placentas","date":"2017-10-13T13:50:03.585+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:202}} {{champion:202}} {{champion:202}} {{champion:202}}","replies":[{"poster":"EternalFrostFire","date":"2017-10-15T19:41:48.275+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1 _2_ **3 ** **_4_**","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ungrateful Thug","date":"2017-10-13T22:27:21.493+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nice","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kloqdq","date":"2017-10-17T17:47:52.746+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is such an interesting find within the lore!
