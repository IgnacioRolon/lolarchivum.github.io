Most of the characters it seems were apart of this. Since Katarina and Zed are fighting against G/NETIC I assume them to be apart of it. Yi sounds as though he is a man on the edge. On the one hand he rescues others, and fights Zed but...he has some odd quotes.\n{{champion:55}} {{champion:238}} \n{{champion:11}} (Formerly?)\n\nHUNTERS -These are individuals all after something. None of them seem to be following higher orders, rather they act on their own. Vayne has her one woman quest for vengeance at any cost. The Vigilante. Vi is the cop, and an honest one which Vayne notes as a rarity. Whereas others would see an open and shut case, Vi wants the truth. Jhin is a collector of black market tech seeking upgrades. The Artist. \n{{champion:67}} {{champion:254}} {{champion:202}} \n\nThe first big question is, what is PROJECT?\n\n>PROJECT: is the perfect fusion of one’s supernatural essence with advanced weaponry and body augmentation. This linking of technology and energy allows extraordinary hosts to channel their essence into physical manifestations and, in rare cases, transcend the corporeal plane. Only subjects possessing extremely focused inner essence and exceptional physical attributes can unlock the true power of PROJECT.\"\nhttps://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/champions-skins/creative-spotlight/how-project-champs-transcended-humanity\n\nIn ways, PROJECT is something we've seen before. A kind of fusion between the magical and technological, like Hextech with a totally different vibe and aesthetic. Not everyone can wield it, as it requires an extraordinary inner power. It can allow you to manifest your essence -perhaps as weapons, blasts of energy, or.....even transcend humanity.\n\n\"Through my work, you shall transcend.\" -{{champion:202}} \n\nThis gives us an interesting idea- Astral PROJECTION. It makes me want to go back to _Projection of the Astral Body_ by  Sylvan J. Muldoon. If PROJECT were to allow a human to transcend corporeal reality, they could become utterly immortal and everlasting. One could perhaps transfer from one machine body to another even after the destruction of it. It could represent absolute freedom,  power of mind over body, and reality itself. It makes sense that people of the PROJECT world would pursue it, but there many problems that have come along with this.\n\n\n Most of these skins are 1350 Epic Skins, but a few of them are 1820 Legendary skins. The latter have fully new voice overs that contain interesting details. We can examine some of the themes of the PROJECT setting through the skins that have been released.\n\n\n--- \n\n#Lost Memories\n\n{{champion:22}} \n\"Memories are more than ones and zeroes.\"\n\"Erasing our memories only ensures we repeat our mistakes.\"\n\"Each reboot, a fresh guiltless mind.\"\n\"Today only matters if we can remember it tomorrow.\"\n\n\n{{champion:11}} \n\"Do not trust corrupted memories.\"\n\"Memories... like shadows in the fog.\"\n\"We are memories - deleted.\"\n\n---\n\n\n\n#Lies In The Code &amp; Life Under PROJECT \n\n{{champion:22}} \n\"The source code lies.\"\n \"They promised us infinite possibility.

I enjoyed it and look forward to more. While voice lines from the few Legendary skins, and cinematic trailers give us hints of what is going on and what this 'skinverse' setting is about, writing takes us directly into it. \n\nThe PROJECT setting takes place in a particular city, unnamed with a population numbering about 100 million. The Tokyo metropolitan area spread over multiple prefectures holds only close to 40 million. I take the city to be a bit like the Boston-to-Atlanta Metropolitan Area in Gibson's Sprawl trilogy. The Boston-Washington Corridor or Northeast Megalopolis is projected to reach 58 million by 2025. It's divided into many sectors -perhaps like city blocks, but also vertical levels. The lower levels are poorer and destitute compared to wealthier upper levels. This reminds me strongly of the relationship between Piltover and Zaun currently. \n\nThis is a dark world lit by neon. Neon itself is an aesthetic choice, since a world so advanced probably wouldn't use gas-discharge tubes. Cyberpunk is a genre full of retrofuturism. It often rains in the PROJECT art, giving us a Noir feel. If this were set on Earth, perhaps it could be Seattle home of Shadowrun. But, one of the characters notes that while he is old (intending to retire 20 years ago) he's still not old enough to remember \"real\" rain. There's no mention of greenery, or plants and the rain that falls is produced by moisture condensers. Why though is a good question. Perhaps it helps clean polluted air? \n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/oU9LuyU.jpg\n\nEveryone in this setting pursues augmentation. But most people can't afford augments fresh off the assembly line. The poor, and working class acquire older parts that upper sectors no longer want. After using augment technology for a time, one's memories somehow become imprinted on the technology. Remember ....PROJECT interfaces with the _soul_ . In a sense, this means after you upgrade, you leave behind a piece of your essence.\n\n\"At my last performance hearing, I asked the reviewing officers what it took to make it in Central. One of them said you had to be ready to trade a piece of yourself—that every upgrade would take you higher up PROJECT’s command line, but would cost some more of who you were in the bargain. \"\n\n Characters are bothered by memories that aren't there's passing through them because of used hardware. Sometimes scrubbing the hardware dozens of times can't remove them and one could imagine some people becoming cluttered by thoughts and feelings they can't get rid of. Jhin has been collecting high end parts stolen, or taken right from his kills -but had experienced personality fragmentation. In theory, in this way Jhin _might_ keep the memories of his targets last moments. In Shadowrun, an illegal cyberdrug is called \"Better Than Life\" or BTLs (Beetles). These single use chips allow you to relive someone else's memories of anything -just as if it were happening. Adventure, Romance, Wealth can all be yours- for a time. Unlike commercial simsense tech, BTLs have no limits to intensity or content. Sex is common, but there is also are rape, murder, torture (giving or receiving), and other crime. Some BTLs are strictly mood chips, with all data except the emotion edited out and overrides removed, so one can move about in the real world and still be aware of one's environment.\n\nIt is implied that, in certain cases it might be possible to raise people from the dead. Jhin reveals to us that Shauna Vayne and her squad \"all died\". But they \"Rebuilt\" her because she was \"special\". It may be that Yi, Yasuo, and others are these special souls.  Jhin says that she \"wears them well.\" indicating most of her hardware was reclaimed from them. And further, that \"PROJECT rebuilds us _all_.\" Based on Ashe's remarks certain military personnel might be formatted after \"death\" in an attempt to gain complete control over them. Or like the Hashashin of old (from which the word Assassin comes) , who were said to smoke  hashish in hopes of forgetting their crimes or believing them to be only a dream.","replies":[{"poster":"Dreamspitter","date":"2017-11-27T20:15:56.529+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Another thought.\n\nWhat happens when someone dies?\n\nSince PROJECT can interact with the \"soul\" then the soul , does that mean a soul can be kept in a mechanical body forever?

This was fairly new ground for the skins team as the idea of thematics and alt universes was just beginning to be discussed. A few of us new concept artists were very excited by the idea and spent a lot of time pushing for more story, cohesion, etc. but at the time it was kept pretty light; Evil Megacorp vs Freedom Fighters. In subsequent years we've added layers to this which I think is turning out to be a really unique way to introduce a world. We've done a similar thing with SG, SG, BM etc. where we begin in with the central characters then spiral out learning about the broader story.\n\nWhen we created Program Lissandra, it was always my intention that she be the AI mastermind behind the PROJECT as the 'bad guys' were under-represented with just Zed and the heroes were really missing a villain. I was lucky enough to work on the follow up set with Ashe, Ekko and Katarina as well as Camille's launch skin and we used them all to continue to flesh out that story (Ekko is Ashe's hacker insurgent and Camille is Lissandra's human hunter, each sent to destroy the other leader). But without a cinematic that story remained largely internal 'head-canon' until much more recently when the team got some narrative support and decided to be more proactive with alt-u storytelling. It's been awesome to see everyone from promotion to execution all working together to give releases a consistent tone and voice and I'm glad (now that I'm not on the team) they are supporting all our wild notions from days of yore.","replies":[{"poster":"Moonboy65","date":"2017-11-28T20:18:16.470+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"do you know the names for PROJECT: Jhin and PROJECT: Vayne's weapons/equipment?","replies":[{"poster":"ChuShoe","date":"2017-11-29T03:59:43.874+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's mentioned in the story, jhin has a pulse rifle and vayne just has a crossbow.

And the \"familiar scent\" with the \"never trust corrupted memories\", could be him associating those 'fake' memories with his current experiences. \nBecause his lore says that he never fought anyone back at his village, only to see the ruins and everyone dead or dying. But shown in his PROJECT trailer, he did fight someone. Showing that something doesn't match up. \nMy thought is that, there was a PROJECT, or machine being in the attack on Yi's village. However, they did something wrong and were killed off by what seems to be the leader of the killing. \nSo when Yi was 'upgraded', the parts from the machine that helped kill his village were used. Perhaps to constantly remind him of what happened, and attempt to corrupt his own self. As he did not truly master Wuju until he was able to clear his mind of what happened, and did not fight for vengeance anymore. This caused him to become one of, if not, THE most powerful bladesman in Runeterra. So IF he were to fall to those thoughts again, his skill and strength would fall and the Noxian army would be able to destroy him.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"JooshBox","date":"2017-11-27T23:52:35.417+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is a really detailed and thorough post, I look forward to reading it after I finish up the PROJECT: story.

A long time ago Riot said after Pentakill, when making group skins they wanted ALL the champions in them to be able to play together as a team that works. That means people have to fill all positions.\n\nPROJECT has a large number of characters -12 not counting PROGRAM but trying to divide them up is difficult.\n\nThat aside PROGRAM apparently includes iBlitzcrank though it's got a unique name, AND Soraka.

This is why I think Program Nami can definitely happen.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"HudnofskiBleh","date":"2017-11-28T17:51:40.379+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is it confirmed that Project, Mecha, and Battlecast are seperate universes?","replies":[{"poster":"ChuShoe","date":"2017-11-29T04:05:04.621+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My personal theory was always project is a fractured group of factions all fighting each other, revived from fighting against viktor's \"glorious evolution\" terminator-esque battlecast epidemic, programs were built to keep project in line or healthy, and the mechas, I haven't found a place for them in the theorized timeline yet, but it's basically just giant robots fighting, pacific-rim style.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"l Ryden l","date":"2017-11-28T05:54:57.730+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How about Pulsefire {{champion:51}} and {{champion:81}}. \n\nI believe in one of Caitlyn's quotes, she mentions how slaying a PROJECT: champion might affect her timeline.
