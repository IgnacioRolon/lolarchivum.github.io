A lot of people denied it, and said that Metal Gear Solid was the sole inspiration. I agree MGS was definitely apart of Yasuo.  But now I am sure, now that I&#039;ve actually started playing Warframe I think it was apart of Zed and the Project theme music. Now the tagline for Warframe was always &quot;Ninjas play free&quot; and the theme was basically cyborg ninjas IN SPAAAAAACE.\n\nNow, listen to the Project theme:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYi2Bf7VAKo\n\nNow listen to this  Warframe track by Keith Power @ 1m 35s to 2:21 called  synapse.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euRlAUB8s6M\n\n\nIf you listen, you hear what parts influenced the LoL track.\n\nAnd here is the _Ash_ warframe. {{champion:238}} \nhttp://warframe.wikia.com/wiki/Ash\nHis abilities are also reminiscent of Zed.

This is a genre I know very little about -but there is in fact a retro vibe that has become one of those iconic parts of scifi. The roots of things can go very deep and stories, games, and art can share influences even if not directly between each other. \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSx_N18TWjs https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3F2pr2FbfQ","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Digital Daddy","date":"2017-04-22T21:28:30.107+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Btw just saying the new orianna skin looks like a warframe too :0","replies":[]}]}
