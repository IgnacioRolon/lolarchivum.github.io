It&#039;s such a small detail, but conservation of detail says this ought to be important. It actually looks more like a cutlass than a dagger, but hey, it&#039;s Bilgewater (that ain&#039;t a noyf matey, disizza NOYF!).\r\n\r\nWhat I&#039;m wondering is if it has some innate magic, or else some religious significance.","replies":[{"poster":"Peridition","date":"2015-07-28T21:59:23.425+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are we sure {{champion:21}} didn't hire {{champion:4}}  to go steal it so she could lure {{champion:41}}  out of his ship?\n\nShe was also behind the boy who told GP it was happening.

Now, ionians had an entire TEMPLE for one knife/blade. So... it might be pretty valuable. Maybe even a magical artifact. I'd say it's powerlevel is at least 0,3 Bard. (1 Bard equals the egg Bard stole in his video.

Being crimson, it could be related to the Noxian Blood Cult that was mentioned briefly in GP's lore. Could be Darkin-related, if that Living Weapon theory is correct.
