They are ageless \n2. They&#039;re Evil (with capital E)\n3.  They&#039;re highly varied in morphology, but _generally_ humanoid . {{champion:223}}  wasn&#039;t always a Catfish man, and has taken other forms IIRC from the Tahm Kench Q&amp;A. \n4. This is theorycrafting now.......but I believe all demons have an inescapable craving that drives them, and is what they embody \n\n{{champion:223}} Despair is what he hungers for\n{{champion:28}} Agony is what she desires\n\n{{champion:56}} &quot;The Eternal Nightmare&quot;  That&#039;s right. Fear. \n\nhttp://universe.leagueoflegends.com/en_US/story/for-demacia/\n\n\n>Lux awoke with a scream, her heart hammering in her chest and her breath coming in wheezing spikes. Terror filled her mind; a nightmare of clawed hooks dragging her beneath the earth, of fetid mud filling her mouth and darkness smothering her light forever. Lux blinked away the last afterimages, glimpsing retreating shadows out of the corner of her eye. Her mouth was filled with the taste of rancid milk, a sure sign of lingering magic\n\nand later\n\n>Lux quickly saddled her mount and rode toward Fossbarrow&rsquo;s northern gate. Dawn was already an hour old, but the town was still to fully come to life. No smoke rose from the forges, no smell of fresh bread wafted from the bakeries and only a very few sullen-looking merchants had their doors open for business. Demacians were hard-working, disciplined and industrious, so to see a frontier town so late to begin the day&rsquo;s work was highly unusual. But if Fossbarrow&rsquo;s people had endured a night like hers, she couldn&rsquo;t blame them for being slow to rise.\n\n\nIn this story we have Nocturne possess  several people, a classic demon ability. \n\n>\"You mortals are always so quick to fear the things you don&rsquo;t understand. So easy to fan those flames and draw forth the most exquisite visions of terror. (...) He can&rsquo;t hear you. And even if he could, you know he&rsquo;s right to fear what his own people would do if they discovered the truth. That he is the very thing they hate.&quot;\n\nI believe Nocturne is the LoL equivalent of Diablo Lord of Terror.  He was originally slain by Fossian Crownguard. But...he didn&#039;t stay dead. Which begs the question of whether demons can ever actually be &quot;destroyed&quot;. \n\n\nThese three are the only &quot;confirmed&quot; demons. What follows is speculation\n\n\n{{champion:35}}  &quot;The Demon Jester&quot;.  In his old lore he claimed that he had been summoned from an unimaginably dark realm. Some have noted his similarities to Pagan the Court Jester of Asmodeus, in the Lady Death Comics and I've been told Shaco quotes him in some lines. Let&#039;s suppose he lives up to his title and really IS a demon. Shaco is an anagram for &quot;chaoS&quot;. That&#039;s what he is a manifestation of. Shaco was speculated, in his old lore interview to embody the darkest aspects of mankind&#039;s desires. And perhaps that&#039;s what all demons are.\n\nNow. The Darkin. Dark. Kin. Think about what that word means. A lot of people really DON'T want the Darkin to be demons, preferring them to be their own totally unique magical creature.  But Tahm Kench at least, called Aatrox &quot;Brother&quot;  (although it neednt be literal) and remarks on Aatrox hunger _&quot;War is a manly appetite, and your directness has my admiration.&quot;_\n\n{{champion:266}} War. He likes sewing the seeds of strife (one of his quotes), and thinks of Tryndamere as his masterpiece. He often takes the underdog side, and fights the uphill battles. It&#039;s not for any sort of gain, or profit, or even power. It&#039;s JUST because. \n\n {{champion:141}}  Slaughter. While Aatrox would fight alongside, and against seasoned warriors,  _&quot;Death and war, this will be delicious.&quot;_ -is what Rhaast says as an interaction with Aatrox. \n\nThen also consider again, the possession aspect. Darkin as far as we know are embodied in weapons. While those weapons are powerful, the Darkin can take over the person who wields them and consume them entirely. It could be speculate that perhaps the Darkin were free roaming demons, that were &quot;sealed&quot; within weapons. However if the will of the wielder is not strong enough, they could possess them and become free roaming again. Kind of insidious. Defeating a powerful demon and then picking up the sweet &quot;loot&quot; like a scythe or a sword and then being taken over.  That&#039;s exactly what Kayn is dealing with.  \n\n>\"Rhaast has long awaited the perfect host in order to join its darkin brethren and lay waste to the world, but Kayn will not be easily dominated.&quot;\n\nI don&#039;t know that Aatrox and Rhaast would exactly see eye to eye. They both kill, TONS of people, but they&#039;re very different. Rhaast says &quot;We....have history&quot;, not that they are &quot;friends&quot; or even &quot;brothers&quot;. \n\nNow, the one thing against this is the idea of the Darkin &quot;race&quot;. The Darkin were an ancient race. Specifically, there used to be a WHOLE lot more of them. We....don&#039;t know anything about where they actually came from. Aatrox first appeared in the Protectorate/Magelord war which might be the &quot;Rune Wars&quot;. It&#039;s not clear.  The confirmed &quot;demons&quot; all seem to be utterly _unique_ one of a kind beings. We haven&#039;t seen any official demon hierarchies, or official &quot;species&quot; or subraces.  But otherwise Darkin certainly seem to have an insatiable drive, ability to possess, are Evil, and are immortal. To say nothing of the clear demonic imagery used in their art. Darkin may or may not be demons. But at the very least it lets them use a certain style when they want to, without having to limit their ideas for evil entities. \n\nAnother thing....\n\n_&quot;Angels to some. Demons to others.&quot;_ -Pinhead, Hellraiser\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/JVhQqxF.jpg\n\nAs Ezreal&#039;s research revealed, Aatrox has touched all cultures in Valoran. Maybe all of Runeterra.  Many cultures relics and even stained glass windows in Demacian churches honor him even though his name has been forgotten. Justicar Aatrox represents the Demacian memory of Aatrox. One wonders.....if demons exist in Runeterra.......are there demonic cults? \n\nWe know there are dark mages and necromancers, lich lords and more. But thus far most of the beings listed seem too selfish, or too destructive to be venerated. To be worthy of worship implies an entity can provide followers with something without pulling a jackass-genie trope or slaughtering them (aside from virgin sacrifices with curvy daggers occasionally). Who would worship Tahm Kench? Who would worship Nocturne? Who would worship Evelynn? \n\nOk. Some people would worship Evelynn. They&#039;d die. But I can imagine some people trying it. I figure if a cult were to exist it would be a bit like the  followers of Zon-Kuthon in Pathfinder. The most extreme sadists and masochists imaginable.  The thing is, such an organization could provide Evelynn a lot of &quot;toys&quot;. And she&#039;s charismatic. But....somehow I think Eve&#039;s appetites are so strong she&#039;d that no cult would last if she were to personally lead it. Then again...how often does a venerated Entity appear to worshippers of anything? Sure. It happens. But those are are only to certain people. Ultimately though, Churches are run by priests and cults by cult leaders. I suppose if Evelynn&#039;s legend were to grow, she might inspire some humans to follow her example. They could be lone serial killers, or small groups of sadists who might pray hoping for blessings while they hunt. Not that this means she would even know about them, or have the ability to give them anything. But that doesn&#039;t stop cultists from existing. \n\nThat aside. WHY does Evelynn have such a BORING name? I mean it has an odd we-can-copyright-it-spelling .\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evelyn_(name)\n\nIt&#039;s not a name like Nocturne (music inspired by night). Shaco (chaoS anagram). Or even Tahm Kench (Tahm meaning &#039;taste&#039; in hebrew and Kench being a barrel for salting fish). Aatrox may or may not count, but it  is a latin word meaning fierce, savage, or bloody. Which makes it a &#039;meaningful name&#039; trope. Now of course if we stick to demon tropes, then all true demons would have &#039;true names&#039; which would be kept secret, thus necessitating the use of other names. I kind of like the idea of demon characters having meaningful names. Tahm Kench took his name from a gambler, and trope invoked &#039;I Have Many Names&#039; . I sort of wonder how Evelynn got her name.   Maybe it was the name of the first person&#039;s agony she tasted? Maybe she killed an &quot;Evelynn&quot; and took her name.  \n\n Also an obvious question. WHERE do they come from? \n\nI know what you&#039;re thinking. HELL! Or some dark dimension that leaks into our world. But the Void has all of those tropes covered. We don&#039;t know how demons are born. They might be a manifestation of humanity itself. They might just be apart of the natural magic of runeterra. Evelynn in her V.O. says that &quot;I was born of a thousand screams. What&#039;s one more?&quot;  What if that was literally true, and a demon could be born of some unspeakable act of sadism so extreme it gained a life of its own ?","replies":[{"poster":"Doozku","date":"2017-09-27T20:06:24.907+0000","up_votes":22,"down_votes":0,"body":"The Darkins have been confirmed by Rioters to not be demons, and aren't being treated as such.","replies":[{"poster":"WAAARGHbobo","date":"2017-09-29T21:45:28.971+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Correct.\n\n Darkin ≠ Demon.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Tattersall","date":"2017-09-27T17:53:00.655+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for not saying that the demons are the seven deadly sins.","replies":[]},{"poster":"HalfTangible","date":"2017-09-27T16:52:32.039+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":3,"body":"Darkin are not demons.","replies":[{"poster":"Dreamspitter","date":"2017-09-27T18:10:12.035+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=HalfTangible,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=wbGUJJ3B,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-09-27T16:52:32.039+0000)\n>\n> Darkin are not demons.\n\nWhich is odd. And let me tell you why.\n\nFirst up....\n\nIs {{champion:8}} a Vampire? No. \n\nHe is a 'Hemomancer', a blood mage. Uses blood magic. Now, his ART very CLEARLY draws on Vampric themes. And there are skins like Nosferatu Vlad and Blood Lord Vlad that enable you to fully embrace that sort of player fantasy. But the character himself is not a Vampire. Do Vampires exist in Runeterra?  Considering Liches do, I wouldn't be suprised but there is a distinction. One is an undead creature , another is a mage.\n\nSo.....\n\nIs {{champion:266}} a demon? \n\nHe very clearly draws heavily on the traditional imagery. It pretty obvious. It just strikes me as odd to use such strong imagery...and then say \"But it's not a demon\". That would be like very clearly designing a creature that looks like a stock dragon in all but the name and saying \"Oh, this isn't a dragon. These are Snogard. But dragons do exist and are nothing like that.\" And then have the \"actual\" dragons of your setting be totally different.  If he is not a demon, then WHAT is it that defines a demon as distinct from any other magical creature? What distinguishes demons from Darkin? And just what are the Darkin _really_?  \n\n\nI mean for example.... Noseratu Vlad and Blood Lord Vlad ARE Vampires -but ONLY in those skins. Skins are a different incarnation of a character. So take a skin like Demon Vi. In that SKIN -Vi is a Demon. But wait. That traditional horned, western demon imagery. Aatrox draws on the same imagery. But why?  I sort of wonder if perhaps the armies that were decimated by Aatrox never forgot that imagery, and if any of those cultures called the creature \"demon\". I mean really, **what** **else ** would you call something like Aatrox if you had _never_ seen it before? Demon/Devil might be applied by hapless commoners, or mercenaries to a whole lot of things that mankind does not actually understand. And then considering the fact that the known 'true demons' have such varied forms, why would anyone who actually managed to survive an encounter with Aatrox or Rhaast not use the term? It's easy invective to slap on any wrongbad Evul thing of doom.\n\nWhen someone in Runeterra says \"demon\"....just what does that mean? How is it defined? What's the most stereotypical image that pops into someones head?  Now mind you, the imagery the people of Valoran come up with could be different from people of Earth. But I wanna know what it is. \n\nDevil's advocate: http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurMonstersAreDifferent\n\nI kinda hope there is a plot twist. And Darkin are '_Devils_'.  :p \n\nKayn's  release did reveal some things about Darkin in that we got to see a human in transition and you could suppose the same happened with Aatrox. I don't know how much was planned in advance, considering it was 4 years before the next one came out. I'm kinda hoping it won't be  12 years before they are ALL out -the 5 Darkin that remain. {{champion:110}}  is implied from interactions with Rhaast that he could be a Darkin in transition as well, and perhaps due for a lore update.\n\nP.S.  {{champion:10}} {{champion:25}} .

Darkin are not Demons and we actually know it for sure.\n\nAbout Darkins:\nDarkins are an almost extinct species that once terrorize Runeterra. This event is known as the Darkin Invasion, which let us assume that Darkin are not from the same dimension as Runeterra. (For clarity - I see the Spirit World as the same dimension as Runeterra, but for humen not reachable).\nIn this Darkin Invasion almost all Darkins were killed. The last five were bounds to weapons. Now they are known as sentient weapon, but these are not their real form.\nThese are the things we know about them rn.\nI understand why you think they are demons, but if you compare them to the demons you notice they have acutally differences.\n\nAbout Demons:\nSince Shens updated lore we know that Runeterra has a Spirit world. A normal human being can't interact with this world and there are probably enough spirit who can't interact with the \"Human\" world as well. (I also believe that Bandle City lays in the Spirit World, since it isn't reachable for humen).\nThey are different kind of spirits and we still know little about them. Janna was born of the prayers for good wind and depends how much people believe in her, she has power and can interact with the human world. Kindred is also described as spirit, same goes for Bard (however, Bard is probably a higher rank, since he can travel different worlds).\nDemons are probably spirit as well, but malicious ones, who are need special condition to interact and harm peoples.\nWe can assume that Demons are born out the dark attribute of humanity. (Evelynn mentions \"I'm born out of a thousand screams\")\nHowever, as I mentions, Demons have to met  special condition to interact and harm peoples.\nTK needs a contract, a deal. Evelynn only needs \"A touch with intention\". After this condition are met, they can kill/toture their victim as much as they want to.\n\nAnother things I wanna mention. Aatrox Promo is outdate, since she happened a while before the retcon. Everything before the retcon should not be taken to seriousily into your argumention.\nSecond thing, almost all lore use the \"Unreliable Narrator\". We don't have any reason to believe the narrator lies to us, however we also have no reason to believe that all his information are correctly as well.\nThird thing, Evelynn is on of the original 40 champions, who were design for this game. Ofc, the newer champion have better and more fitting names. I wouldn't think too much about her name, tbh.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Phazanor ","date":"2017-09-28T00:49:26.891+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Finally someone knows that Tahm =/= Gluttony","replies":[{"poster":"Dreamspitter","date":"2017-09-28T08:04:08.598+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well.....it seems they weren't _entirely_ wrong.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Reav3,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=94QcNJyP,comment-id=0008000000000000000000000003000000010000,timestamp=2017-09-24T02:56:59.941+0000)\n>\n> Demons are intrinsically motivated by killing humans.

Don't get me wrong I love Kench's short story I just want to know more about how he became whatever he is. I am also super excited to see future demon champions that Riot will release as it seems they really want to run with the 7 deadly sins idea.

They're like the opposite of humans, whereas humans are very physical beings with weak souls demons and spirits like Kindred, Tahm, and Eve are all almost entirely soul with little matter anchoring them to the corporeal world, which makes things like Eve not being spotted from a mile away with her glowing pink horns in her demonic form when she's stealthed make sense because she's simply mostly in the spirit realm, and things like Tahm's insatiable hunger make sense because his body's probably mostly a hollow pit of magic that things just sort of fall into.\n\nI also think the Darkin are a possible offshoot of demons, sort of like branches in regular evolution, but also Darkin evolved a physical form that their souls were connected to more indirectly, namely the weapons like Aatrox's sword and Rhaast's scythe, though some didn't like Varus's Darkin (possibly Pallas) and then people just sort of shoved them in their physical forms (or in the case of Pallas a pool of water with what little physical form they had) and then they became the deathy demon men they are now.\n\nAlso think they could be a different form of ascended, sort of like how Atreus just sort of got pushed aside by the Aspect when he became a Pantheon, though obviously this brings up the question of where the extra souls of the Darkin came from, and if I went any further into this I would probably get a headache and ramble even harder so I'll stop now.
