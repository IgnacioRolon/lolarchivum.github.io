I think) and every game I've played in since has been laggy as hell. even with the graphics settings on low, all of a sudden I'll see my health start depleting and my abilities not appearing then suddenly I teleport into a place I wasn't before and i'll either have done a terrible trade or i'll have died. I've restarted my computer, fiddled with the video settings as well as closed everything that was running along side the game. No fix yet, anyone having any trouble with the same kinda thing? or have some way to fix it?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-21T19:24:16.887+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The first thing we need to figure out is if you're having fps issues or network problems like packet loss.
