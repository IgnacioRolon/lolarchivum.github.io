I am just wondering how it will be handled as it would be a lot of work to give the full 1820 treatment, but at the same time it would be mean to the players that own it if you didn&#039;t. Just wondering how it might play out.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-05-13T17:27:40.211+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Im FrankReynolds - \n\nThis is a hard question to answer, particularly because updating content is a case by case basis. A lot of the changes made to skins for a champion during an update depend on the base champion's kit and how that's changing. \n\nFor example, if we give a champion a new ability for example, the skins will also need the new particles. Now, if a skin had unique particles prior on the skill, that's something we would also want to add to the new skill. IIRC, Tristana was giving new bell ringing on the (E) of Fire Fighter Tristana, so that type of thing isn't out of the question either. \n\n**TL;DR**: I don't have an official answer, but I hope this explanation of how we go about things may give a bit of insight on the design process and how this could potentially be tackled in the future.","replies":[{"poster":"Elewd","date":"2016-05-13T21:26:27.330+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"does the price/tier of a skin apply to this as well? Like in your example the tristana skin, it originally only had a new auto attack animation for splashing water, but after her update as you said, she got more firefighter theme'd effects such as the bell, the bomb looking different, water effects on her rocketjump.\nBut during the Zyra texture update when asked about the red vines for skt you claimed \"skin is 750 so no new particles\" \nAlso when do we get unique recalls for some of the 1320 skins that got bumped up to 1320 after they were originally released at 975. (seriously when irelia gets her VU i expect a ton of new effects and custom recal to her frostblade skin cuz it is def not worht 1320)","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-05-13T23:11:28.843+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Partially, yes. \n\nAt this time, we don't have plans to retroactively add recalls to existing skins.","replies":[{"poster":"Elewd","date":"2016-05-14T05:34:50.902+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"do you think it will ever happen tho? its kind of awkward when a skin like Blackthorn morgana is a 1350 Skin, when Ghost Bride Morgana is only 975.\nBoth skins are absolutely beautiful in their own unique ways, but its just strange that the 975 skin looks like it had more work put into it.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-05-16T17:38:35.863+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To be 100% honest, I don't have an answer for this one. In an ideal situation, yes, we would like to go back and update some of the older content, which in some cases, would mean a new recall animation. It's not something we've been discussing, which leads to my original answer - it's not something we have plans to do right now. That doesn't mean we couldn't consider this in the future, should be have the bandwidth/discussion around it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hello I am Bird","date":"2016-05-16T16:42:55.240+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/r0ZFEqzXbM0/maxresdefault.jpg","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"GreenLore","date":"2016-05-13T08:23:36.298+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its really hard to judge this because we simply never had a big VU for a champion who owns a legendary skin that is still avaliable for purchase.\n\nI mean Alien invader Heimerdinger,magnificient twisted fate and so on are all in the vault,so I can see why riot doesn't bother bringing them to the same level as regular legendary skins.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Arakadia","date":"2016-05-14T17:24:04.391+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Annie in WonderLand is 1820, but the only new thing is how her model looks.

Gatekeeper Galio was made much later, and so it meets the quality bar of modern Legendaries, as well as having a higher-quality model than most of Galio's other skins since they're older.\n\nThey would have to actually downgrade it in order for this to happen, so I wouldn't worry.","replies":[]}]}
