I'm repairing the launcher and have updated to the most recent windows version. I believe that the error will still persist. The game also 'stops responding' whenever i click on the loading screen (as in just click my mouse), but then shortly recovers. Please assist!\r\n\r\n~Thanks","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-23T21:40:16.998+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like your network might be having problems establishing a connection to the game server, so it's failing into a dormant state and getting stuck.   Basically, by waiting to respond it means that it's failing to make that connection!  I suggest using our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to help get this fixed up!
