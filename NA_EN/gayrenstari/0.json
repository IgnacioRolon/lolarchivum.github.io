Are you so jelous of 2 handsome and muscular men loving each other in the biblical way and only belong to each other? And they even beg Riot to say Garen and Taric are not offically romance couple, lmao, like rioter will just tell you in the face that the might of demacia is gay or something, where is their brain? \n\nAnd hence evertime I started a thread about Garen and Taric, there are full of jellyfish spamming saying they are not offical. IT SHOWS IN THE LORE HOW MUCH THEY LOVE EACH OTHER! YOU DON'T LET THEM BE WITH EACH OTHER AND YOU FORCE THEM TO BE WITH WOMEN TO AVOID BAIS! WHAT KIND OF JUSTICE IS THAT?!\n\nI'm still amused how  a rioter just replied my random post and telling me Garen and Taric is not officially romance couple, like I opened a fobbiden door or something. :)","replies":[{"poster":"BlackKnightJack","date":"2019-08-10T01:25:43.231+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, Garen loved Taric so much he personally sentenced him to climb Mount Targon expecting him to die.","replies":[{"poster":"GayrensTari","date":"2019-08-10T14:04:57.775+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"\"And while the Crown of Stone was traditionally used by the dishonored to simply flee Demacia and make a new life in exile, \" \nGaren tries to protect Taric even when the later commited a felony.

They are the shield and the sword, like valmar&amp;kai, they are bounded to be one. They hide the forbbiden love between Garen and Taric but more openly admit Valmar&amp;Kai, because Garen's social status and background is too special, unlike Valmar/Kai, Garen is the might of Demacia, and his reputation can not be hindered by homosexual relationship like that.","replies":[]}]}]}
