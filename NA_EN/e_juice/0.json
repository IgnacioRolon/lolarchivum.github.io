I don't remember when it dissapeared, but my friend had the same incident with the skin \"mafia jinx\". I don't know if any of my other skins dissapeared but I hope that this can be solved.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-01-28T01:17:47.139+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there! \n\nSorry to hear about your missing content. \n\nWe'd removed some player's content if it was obtained from Refer a Friend abuse.
