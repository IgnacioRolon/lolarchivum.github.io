Early seasons had some *insane* damage.  But it was mostly on scalings.  There were however also some insanely broken items.  Most people forget that Season 1 was dominated by mages, because something called Zhonya's Ring existed in the game - it was literally {{item:3089}} {{item:3157}} in one item, for the cost of one item.    What didn't exist as much in the early seasons were the depth of champion selections, strategies, and knowledge that exist today, the amount of front-loaded *physical* damage {{item:3078}} {{item:3095}} {{item:3147}} represent,   the damage/mobility creep represented by the past several seasons' worth of reworks, and the war on mana.\n\nFor me, even with the balance issues that existed, early seasons felt better because:\n- the old rune system gave a lot more flexibility on builds and stats than Runes Reforged\n- mana-based champions weren't constantly forced to recall because of forced mana shortages\n- when you got one-shotted it was usually by a spell or ability that you knew you shouldn't be getting hit by - instead of two or three near-instant autoattacks and/or spammable physical abilities\n\nOthers' experience may vary.   \n\nI think that it's entirely possible that \"Runes Reforged\" should actually just become Masteries Reforged - and possibly see certain nerfs to reduce keystones to the level of old masteries -  and that the old runes and stat bonuses should come back but be free.  I think the new system has produced some new and cool iconic abilities - Klepto, Grasp, Augment are the kinds of things I think are not fundamentally broken and deserve to stay - but the ability to customize your early free ~1000 gold worth of stats so precisely was more empowering.","replies":[]}]}
