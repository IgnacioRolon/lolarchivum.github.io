However the cooldown on the tool tip on everything when you try to level any ability is 0.0 -&gt; 0.0. Really confusing if you need to know what the cooldowns are before you put a point in them.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Exgeniar","date":"2015-11-18T04:03:25.748+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fixed in next patch!
