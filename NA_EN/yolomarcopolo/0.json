When I use an imac to play league my ping is 26ms.  When I use windows to play league, my ping is 55ms. I have updated OS&#039;s for both systems (sierra and windows 10) and I use the computers both on the same network. \r\n\r\nNow, I realize there are other major differences with the computers (graphics cards, processors, etc, the list goes on). However, the baffling thing is that the windows pc is much newer and has a way better graphics card and processors.  I use the windows pc to play assassins creed origins, farcry 5 etc, while the older mac could not handle those games very well.\r\n\r\nObviously, it doesn&#039;t really matter that much since the ping is very low either way, but I thought I would ask for shits and giggles. XD\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!","replies":[]}
