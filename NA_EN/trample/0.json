Sion could be really squishy early game.

It's no Morgana Q, but it also travels a lot faster and keeps him at a safe range.\nHis W is a shield relative to health, that still scales with minion deaths anyways.\nKinda hard to poke down a guy who has a longer range harass pre-6 than most ADCs and supports and a shield to boot.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"redniwediS","date":"2015-02-26T19:41:58.767+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Any two people who are on the same page can make any combination of two champions work in bot lane.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Thefriendlyorc","date":"2015-02-26T19:47:49.733+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So this is why he is getting nerfed.
