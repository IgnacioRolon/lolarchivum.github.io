Judging by our ranks, you would be dragging me down.\n\nI like to think about it like this...\n\nIf you want to be a higher rank than the rank you are in, you shouldn't EVER listen to the people who are stuck in the same rank as you unless you are around Master-Challenger tier. Otherwise, no random player will have any useful information for you. You dont need pings if you can look at the mini map and comfortably predict where enemies are and arent.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Solutate Khaz","date":"2019-07-07T23:23:14.859+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MagicFlyingLlama,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=0E1s1WAi,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2019-07-07T05:49:47.433+0000)\n>\n> You dont, because it makes you a huge liability to your team.
