The troll poll and such are effected by what, DoTs applied before using the skill and tethers applied before activation? The only counters to all the mobility are toxic in their own right and complained about too, such as {{champion:1}}&#039;s stun Tibbers with no warning, {{champion:13}}&#039;s perma root, etc. Other than these, the answer is usually \"just CC them before they can do anything\" which would be fine if these kinds of issues weren&#039;t so common, you don&#039;t have the CC every game to keep 3 or 4 of the 5 opposing team from moving while you 100-0 them, that happens once in a blue moon.\n\n\n\nThis has led to patch after patch of things being nerfed that didn&#039;t seem like all that big of deals, while idea after idea is pitched to deal with the problems players want to see fixed and see nothing in return.

Riot is totally okay with the concept of snowball champions.  The reality is that some champions snowball incredibly easily with a lead, while others are only slightly stronger when ahead.\n\nOn the other hand, some champions have abilities that are incredibly strong even when even or down in gold.  These abilities frequently offer hidden power that may completely determine an otherwise even game.  Taric's armor aura or Warwick's ability to single handedly neuter an enemy carry are both abilities that don't require many resources to be incredibly effective.  These are the abilities Riot seems to be more concerned about.  In reality, these probably are the type of abilities that have a bigger impact on more games, as champs with these abilities frequently do tend to have a higher win rate than champs with great snowball ability, but these champions generally don't feel oppressive in the same way that a fed Annie does.\n\nAll of that being said, I personally think there is still something wrong with champions that feel too oppressive when ahead.  The reality is that most of League's player base isn't playing in high level play where deaths are less frequent, and it is very common for snowball champions to start snowballing.  When a snowball champion gets fed off one bad enemy laner, the power fantasy of these snowball champions has a significant negative impact on the play experience of every other player on that enemy team.  In my opinion, this is what breeds lots of toxicity.  When the enemy Annie or Fizz gets a couple of solo kills early on your mid laner, there isn't really any light at the end of the tunnel in most games.  \n\nChampions who are very oppressive when ahead create a culture of blame which undermines team play.  Rather than try to figure out how to win, because it seems hopeless, many teams instead resort to calling out a player for having \"fed\" the oppressive champion.  This obviously breeds toxicity.\n\nFurther, however, champions who are very oppressive when ahead also sometimes have a negative impact on the players who play them.  The power fantasy of these champions frequently devolves into being able to walk around the map with impunity and kill anyone they encounter, even 1v2ing or 1v3ing at times.  Players who experience this power fantasy, or players who watch it spin out, or who are forced to try to deal with it, frequently draw the wrong conclusions and mistakenly view this as core to the league experience.  These experiences are what spawn the \"carry\" mentality, where players start to believe they have to single handedly carry games or else they are going to lose.  This leads players to start to feel that if an enemy player is snowballing, the game is over, and they stop playing.  Some players take it further and begin to feel like if they give up even a slight lead, they aren't going to be able to carry, and thus aren't going to be able to win.","replies":[{"poster":"Trash ADC Btw","date":"2015-08-13T17:01:34.647+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You hit the nail RIGHT on the head.

People like to say items like Banshee's don't get to count, because that's counter-building, not counter-play. So, removing an item that blocks an unforeseen spell, what counter was there to a Veigar within about 1000 range just dropping a stun on you much more frequently than Annie's Tibbers and for much longer duration? There was no reliable action the enemy could take against his stun. It was pretty absurd if you actually remember being on the receiving end of it as well, especially from a support Veigar who only had to use it to peel or just CC a vital target, without having to worry so much about how he'd get to the target himself. \n\nThe ult nerf is uniformly bad, though, that's because nerfs are bad things, usually. The Q rework though.. doesn't that now reward him even more for skillful play? It allows you to potentially kill 2 minions per Q, which isn't too likely, I understand, or kill a minion while harassing the enemy champion at the same time, which is much more likely than the boards have led me to believe. That sounds more rewarding for skill than a point-and-click \"+1 AP or harass\" to me.\n\nWhat skillful play was there to be seen from someone who only had 1 hard to land ability, which could be made negligibly easy to land by landing a fairly easy stun (gonna be honest: I barely even played Veigar but still had a very high chance of landing that stun by making sure the edge was on the champion, it was incredibly easy), paired with 2 point-and-click abilities? That sounds like the type of kit that most people complain about, to be honest.\n\nSo I guess that brings me to another question: Was he actually fine or are people wanting to say he was fine because they want what they once had unchanged? Was he actually healthy or are people just saying he was because of how much power budget was in his stun therefore it deserved to feel like it was broken? \n\nBecause from what I remember, during both the boards and forums, there were a lot of complaints about the stun.

Because of that, his pool allows hit to maybe get an extra two spells off during a fight where he might otherwise be killed, or maybe allows him to dodge some high-impact spells or escape a gank.  On the other hand, this skill has a huge cost to Vlad - 20% of his health and a massive cooldown.\n\nMeanwhile, Fizz in a champion who can instantly kill you if you get close to him.  He has massive amounts of burst damage.  His trollpole has a much, much shorter cooldown and merely a mana cost to use, which means that he can deal massive burst damage and then become untargetable to avoid any repercussions for his risk move; he also gets to wait for his cooldowns in safety, and his individual skills are much more impactful than Vlad's once he gets them back up.\n\nWith some CDR and mana regen, Fizz pays almost nothing for this skill, so he is able to use it much more freely to dodge less-important spells.  It's also much more versatile because it allows him to reposition and deals massive damage to anyone nearby when he comes down.  Enemies are *punished* for waiting for him to leave his untargeable state because of the AoE damage.  Compare this to Vlad, who only gains a slight movement speed boost and whose pool does relatively little damage.  Enemies can easily wait for him to come out of his pool and then murder him afterwards.\n\n\nIn my opinion, Vlad is an example of how to do untargetability properly - a long-cooldown high-cost ability that allows Vlad to avoid a few seconds of pain, and survive a little longer in fights to deal a little more damage, placed alongside a kit of slow, sustained damage and immobility.\n\nMeanwhile, Fizz is an example of the wrong way to do untargetability - a short-cooldown low-cost ability that can be used to dodge almost anything, which also deals heavy damage, allows Fizz to choose if he wants to re-enage or not, and is coupled with a kit of extreme burst damage.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PeachsProperty","date":"2015-08-13T03:46:50.124+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":2,"body":"Community haas views that vary on each champion.\n\nRIOT has statistics.","replies":[{"poster":"Shadow Gilgamesh","date":"2015-08-13T04:10:44.009+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"While true, statistics do say a lot, and can sometimes be an indicator of problem champs, they don't always paint as full a picture as you would think.\n\nAs a key example, when they took LBs silence she wasn't a top pick, and she had a sub 50% winrate, that was a while back when they were removing a low counterplay mechanic from a lot of assassins because it WAS unfair, regardless of if the champ(s) was massively OP or not.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Remlap1223","date":"2015-08-13T09:52:00.474+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alright kids, today's keywords are \"windows of counterplay.\"\n\nBoth Annie and Vel'Koz can stun you, deal ridiculous amounts of magic damage over a very little amount of time, and are both immobile mages.
