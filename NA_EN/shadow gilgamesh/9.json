Despite the fact that this game is fantasy, it does tend to run on modern physics in that there is no way that a bird casting a massive blizzard from the shadows would cause you to somehow never see the blizzard. \nThis issue with Nidalee is most likely not a fault of Nidalee's, but more likely a fault with how the Fog of War is wrongly causing things to render as if they were still in the Fog of War. While I haven't experienced the Nidalee invisible spear chuckery yet, I have experienced a similar thing happen when playing against a LeBlanc who's entire rotation went invisible when she attacked from the shadows. It was like \"Boom! I'm dead\" and then suddenly LeBlanc is beside me. So given that Nidalee isn't the only trigger of this issue, this would be a much, much larger scale problem to deal with that would require more than just tweaks to Nidalee.","replies":[{"poster":"Spacesuit Spiff","date":"2015-03-25T02:43:37.959+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not the shadows though, some games every single spear is invisible and they stay that way for the whole game.

Even when you counterjungle her, kill her multiple times, win the lanes and control dragon, she can murder whoever she wants or just pelt the team with invisible spears, while healing her team and stealing objectives with an execute. I'm not one to complain about specific champs (this sort of thing is what bans are for) but I'm never gonna understand why they let Nida of all people be this powerful. Sure, tanks and RG are a thing, but using that amount of resources on a jungler that's just gonna jump away and heal herself means you probably lose the teamfight.","replies":[]},{"poster":"bad arcade kitty","date":"2015-03-24T23:27:19.545+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"a secret passive, sometimes nid throws spears so stealthy that you cannot even see them!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sammystorm","date":"2015-03-24T20:18:16.396+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its not just nidalee.

I was originally under the impression that it was an inconsistent bug, that sometimes triggered and sometimes didn't, but I've noticed it can be replicated consistently after playing against her more. Now, there's the question of whether this is playing off of an intended mechanic or if a similar bug is also affecting other champs, because something similar happens with abilities such as nunu's or anivia's ults (if you can't see the champ, you can't see the ult). If it's intended, that's one thing. If it's not, it's a mechanic affecting many champs that needs to be fixed.","replies":[]}]}
