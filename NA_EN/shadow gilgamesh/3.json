Because now ranked is just normals with better match making. Sure I could still get matched with smurfs or with people inviting at high as they can, but at least the game won&#039;t on it&#039;s own go &quot;hey man, here&#039;s 3 diamonds, let&#039;s match them with 2 bronzes against a team of 4 bronzes and a silver and call it fair!&quot; because of separate ranked and normal MMR. If Riot doesn&#039;t care about competitive integrity why should I? ranked players will get fucked over FAR more by getting matched with 4 mans or against a 5man team than they will by me clicking &quot;fill&quot; even though I&#039;m not up to snuff with my ADC skills and mid lane I can only use {{champion:3}}. Hell even if I use champs I&#039;m not particularly good at it won&#039;t be as bad as what Riot has done.\r\n\r\nI would have NEVER felt like this during soloq&#039;s time, in fact, I didn&#039;t play much ranked because I knew if I was gonna ranked I should put my tryhard pants on and I just don&#039;t do that much. I know not wanted to give it 110% makes me shitty to the other players in ranked, I&#039;m not crazy, but for the first time, I actually feel okay with being a fucking worthless brain dead scumfuck bastard pile of trash mental dick face that should be gunned down in the street like the degenerate I am. To think that up till now I&#039;ve even refused to pick up champs like {{champion:105}} {{champion:238}} or abuse shit like tank {{champion:245}} or echos {{champion:77}} because I know that shit ruins the fun for at least one other player in the game, and now I&#039;m one bad day from being the guy who goes off the deep end and becomes the shitass who plays a champ on release day in ranked.\r\n\r\nfuck, maybe I should just stick with Overwatch so I don&#039;t start fucking up peoples promos and shit.","replies":[{"poster":"I am Pacman","date":"2016-06-01T15:27:09.435+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> I actually feel okay with being a fucking worthless brain dead scumfuck bastard pile of trash mental dick face that should be gunned down in the street like the degenerate I am\n\nCouldn't have said it better myself.  I'm not insulting you I'm agreeing with you.\n\nThen again since you are bronze 2 I don't see much evidence of you ever putting on the try hard pants and going 110%.  If anything a more relaxed mindset will probably help you climb better.","replies":[]}]}
