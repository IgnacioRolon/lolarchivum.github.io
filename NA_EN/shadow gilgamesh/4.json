The animation is very unintuitive on when you&#039;re locked into the pull, sometimes it seems like people are getting pulled even though they left the area of effect before he even fully extended his axe, much less actually pulled people, I can&#039;t tell you how many times I&#039;ve seen people waste their escape move or even flash, only to be pulled all the way back to Darius despite being clear with a wide margin. Most other pull/push mechanics work fairly well in terms of intuitive results, dodge blitzgrabs and thresh hooks before they hit you and you&#039;re clear, you have until you collide with Alistar and Poppy before you get shoved, but Darius&#039;s pull REALLY doesn&#039;t make sense.","replies":[{"poster":"Wofye","date":"2015-03-28T06:47:19.209+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"I have flashed landed out of the pull animation once and after the animation ended, I got pulled ALL the way back, that was pretty dumb.","replies":[{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2015-03-28T16:51:25.149+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Darius mains downvoting this.\n\nNot realizing this bug is one of the reason's Darius is kept weak.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TheFleetAdmiral","date":"2015-03-28T17:45:00.543+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Making it so that you can flash out of his Apprehend would allow him more noticeable power somewhere else, like maybe increasing mana or something?

Are you outplayed when Lissandra, Annie, Or Veigar click R? Do you know what outplayed means?\n\nBruh, I play Darius, and being able to Bait flashes using your E is bullshit. It is confirmed to be a bug, it was actually fixed, but then reinstated when they made a fix to cone shaped abilities firing in the wrong direction.\n\nRiot even once admitted they had to balance him in some area's around a bug in his E. That's literally aroudn 20% of his power invested in an \"unreliable\" bug. it is pretty much RNG, as you will only land it if they are mid flash as the E is half-way through.","replies":[{"poster":"dunk is my life","date":"2015-03-28T19:04:01.845+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That was poor writing from my part I agree I shouldn't have said outplayed.\n\nI would like to see a cd buff to his pull if it were to be changed tho","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Shadow Gilgamesh","date":"2015-03-28T17:42:52.276+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"His pull WOULD be fine if either you could escape it during the delay (the way the ability is supposed to work), or if the delay was removed or far shorter so it didn't give the illusion of counterplay.

Nothing else matters except if you were in range when he pressed the button.","replies":[{"poster":"EndlessSorcerer","date":"2015-03-28T18:12:24.300+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Isn't that what I said?
