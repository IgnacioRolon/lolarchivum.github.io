I recently tried to open LOL and the game WOULD let me sign into my account, view my profile and all that, however it would not let me start a game. It had something about scanning files in the top corner where the PLAY button usually is. After about 15 minutes, the Percentage of files scanned was still 0% so I uninstalled and reinstalled.\r\n\r\nNow the entire client wont open at all. I have run it as an admin. All i get is the Logo appearing on my screen, and nothing else. The logo just stays there. Task Manager says the app is running, and occassionally I get a message about PVP kernel not responding.\r\n\r\nAny ideas how I can get League up and running again?\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nMark","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-02-02T00:03:30.352+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Both of these issues may actually be related!  The patcher needs to first scan your game files to prepare for updates but needs permissions.  In the same way, your patcher also needs to have permissions from your OS to launch, otherwise it won't appear.  The kernel error further affirms this, so I suggest running through each step of the [permissions](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) guide to get that access restored.  Let me know if you have any questions!","replies":[]}]}
