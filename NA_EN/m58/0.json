It sounds like you're having a network issue that's leaving you behind and losing sync.  The hextech repair tool is a great feature, but it's not going to fix every connection problem.  I recommend also using our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to strengthen your connection and stay in your group!  Let me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]}]}
