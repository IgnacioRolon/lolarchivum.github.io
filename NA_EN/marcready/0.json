They are sneaky, uncatchable rats whose kits do not allow funny trades.\n\nAgainst a Yasuo you can't even fight in your own minion wave without taking a shitload of damage while also offering him a tons of mobility. The windwall? Let's not talk about it: there's nothing more frustrating of a Yasuo eating a skillshot of yours, pooping a crit on you and writing \"outplayed\". This is not a \"big play\", this is a ridiculous cheat which makes me curse god himself.\n\nWhat about Zed? In lane, if he's pushed to tower he just spams his q and proceeds to last hit with his passive, if you are hugging your tower... well, don't be silly: you have no chance to save your butt cheeks, because he can dive you whenever he wants with no retaliation. Building armor makes no sense against Zed, since he will just buy armor pen while you will do no damage to him.\n\nSure these champs are hard and need time to master, but if a Yasuo or a Zed is good enough, you can only eat poop. fact.\n\nWhen I beat Yasuo or Zed players I don't feel like I've been a better player than them, I just think they haven't been good enough with these champs and it makes me nervous. When I win against them I feel angry anyway because it has not been a funny match: I literally try-harded to kill them, to stomp them, I've put so much effort that I feel exhausted\n\nIn conclusion, whether I lose or not against them, the match makes me rage and I often find myself shouting curses to the pc \n(Sorry for my bad english :/ )\n\n\nEDITED\n\nA more in-depth discussion\n> [{quoted}](name=Knight Devout,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=kw9Ni3xV,comment-id=000d,timestamp=2014-12-26T01:21:42.209+0000)\n>\n> http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/d2kh7wAg-this-is-why-yasuo-and-zed-are-problematic-champions\n> \n\nGood post which explains better  my thought\n\n> [{quoted}](name=RasCaelestis,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=kw9Ni3xV,comment-id=00010000000000000000,timestamp=2014-12-26T00:19:01.933+0000)\n>\n> Aye.

This is balanced by having much higher kill potential when they get close. \n\nHis infinite dash makes him slippery enough to dodge most skillshots, and his windwall and passive shield allow him to not care about the ones he can't dodge. Poke doesn't do shit. \n\nInfinite dash (again), no resource costs whatsoever, and a next to instant cooldown AOE attack makes him farm better than some mages. \n\nSo he naturally overcomes the disadvantages of being melee, while keeping the advantages. \nWhere exactly in there is he really not overpowered?","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"SouL1ess","date":"2014-12-25T23:36:07.140+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":1,"body":">I literally try-harded to kill them, to stomp them, I've put so much effort that I feel exhausted\n\nThat feel. ahahahaha.\n\nSums up my normal game experience, playing against Zed 90% of the time.","replies":[]},{"poster":"EIven Rope","date":"2014-12-25T21:32:06.925+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":2,"body":"I agree, they just have too much utility and are too easy to live in any situation pretty much, while having gnarly damage.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rikari","date":"2014-12-26T16:14:18.102+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kinda dumb how an ad assassin can outrange you,outsustain you,outplay you,outdamage you, tower dive you behind your jungler and get way away from you.\nEvery time.","replies":[]},{"poster":"meatjunjun","date":"2014-12-26T02:36:32.870+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":6,"body":"The way I see it, Zed and Yasuo are balanced champs because they're melee.  They need to be able to pick their spots because almost all their opponents are ranged.\n\nA ranged mid laner has the opportunity to poke as long as they have mana, whereas a melee champ can only stand far away and try to capitalize on your mistake.\n\nThe point is, yes they are very hard to fight if the player is good, but they worked hard to get that good.  You shouldn't punish them for that.  A melee champion also needs the ability to kill a mage if they find a way to get in.

Yas and Zed both counter anyone considered squishy, so skill for skill, they are better than the vast majority of mid laners. On top of this, the OP argues that they don't have particularly counterable kits. You can't poke Yas effectively between his windwall and passive shield, and Zed just has an instant delete button combined with an escape that he doesn't have to burn to get to you. Neither of them suffer from farming problems, under tower or otherwise, and neither have to worry about mana. \n\nThey are, in short, un-fun. Un-fun because they have powerful kits that leave little room for counterplay.","replies":[{"poster":"meatjunjun","date":"2014-12-26T17:37:11.835+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"You're absolutely right.  Yasuo and Zed are designed to counter mages.  But I ask you, what's wrong with that?\n\nRanged mages have so much advantages over melee champions.  They can poke all day as long as they manage their mana.  And even against a Zed or Yasuo, if they make a mistake and you poke them a few times, you have a huge life advantage while they have to just sit back.\n\nMy point is, Yasuo and Zed counter squishy mages, but these same mages counter almost every melee champ.  So I see absolutely nothing wrong with this balance.\n\nHaha this is how I see the forums' complaints about Zed/Yasuo = \"Oh nooooooo, these assassins counter the mages I love to play.

Almost all mages, the standard pick for mid, are relatively balanced and can expect to have an even matchup against most other mages. Now we have single champs who can reasonably expect to walk into lane against most standard picks and have an advantage from the loading screen. That is specifically what Riot said they don't want to happen, and that's what's making the match up Un-Fun. \n\nLanes should have their meta, and players actually require solid skill to break the meta. Top and jungle should be melee. Mid and ADC should be ranged. Support is based on the kit not the attack style. Once you start allowing anyone to go anywhere, you start having game breaking balance issues, and that's what's happening here. It's happened once before at top lane when Vayne and Quinn and Ryze started stomping on a whole group of champs, and it's happening again in mid lane.

He's got incredibly strong manaless wave clear and amazing escape.\n\nBasically, Zed is the kind of champion where, if you step out of position for even a second, he can kill you, but he has to screw up comparatively much harder to die, and it's practically impossible to keep him off the minion wave.
