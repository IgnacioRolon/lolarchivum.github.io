His damage is still ungodly high, the only problem i've forseen after testing him is that the new delay on E may be too high, as hitting the stun is much more difficult now, especially when escaping, but more aptly is problematic because its the only reliable way for Vivi to hit his W. With the reliability change to E, it might be a good time to lower the delay on W, if only a little bit.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Critkeeper","date":"2015-02-13T21:12:23.121+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Albiros,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=PQIAuhGt,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2015-02-13T16:07:31.027+0000)\n>\n> The E range was INCREASED from 650 to 700, not reduced.\n> \n> Q also hits 2 targets so you'll be able to farm those minions even more effectively and increase your AP faster.\n> In the end game the 0.2 ratio nerf on ult won't matter since you probably got enough ap from Q farming to keep it at the same damage levels as earlier.\n> \n> Next time read the changes more carefully.\n\nthe difference in ap gain with the double q is negligable because by the time you max your q at level 9 you will be killing every minion with it anyway.

Also, as a skillshot it's even less likely that you'll hit your opponent with it because, once again, your probably not going to able to actually stun them. The only way that this Q change is possibly a buff is if you can consistently setup a minion kill + enemy champ hit for harrass. Finally, the Q farm argument is highly situational. Veigar *cannot* one-shot minions with Q until later in the game. This means that to make the Q change useful at all he has to prep the minions and then move into a position to hit 2 minions at once while both are at lower health, which is fine, in a bot game maybe. Against oppenents? If your not Q harrassing them, then they're at full health and will be ready to aggress on you, you won't have the positional freedom to line up minion Q-shots and with your E delays, you have a much lower chance at stopping them from walking all over you.\n\nR is straight up nerfed. No compensation anywhere, just nerfed.\n\nTL;DR: Nerfed through loss of DFG. Changes further nerf all reliable damage output scenarios and CC effectiveness.
