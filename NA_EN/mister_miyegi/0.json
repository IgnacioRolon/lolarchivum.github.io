Of course they start fighting and TOP, who is picking first, takes Yasuo. The other guys start already with threats..... And out of nowhere, the actual troll is my sup who comes and sits (idle) next to the tower...of course they kill him and he repeats over and over and over so im starting to lose it! I chat the opponents to just ignore him and give me a chance, i am willing to try 1v2 as long as they ignore him but they won't (at some point late game they did ignore him cause it became fkn ridiculous) so everyone was ganking bot just to take a kill and as a result i could not even farm while the 'Yasuos' did not give a damn. I guess they even banned me too LOL!\r\n\r\nAnd then.... in what was probably the 8th straight game where i was the only on my team that cared for the win (cause you have to win sometime right? unless you are playing this game to screw with your teammates)... I guess i had too much of that, so i type pre-game lets fuck them in an attempt to get them more 'involved'. Start of the game, 5 minutes in and my sup quits! And im like...NO MY FUCKING GOD, NO, NOT AGAIN! TOP has Yasuo and has never left top while he was playing alone cause his opponent came bot so i was 1v3, mid was 1v2 while Yasuo and JG were farming carefree. I was pinging like crazy but none of them gave a shit...and then with all the arrogance in the world, Yasuo asks to ban me because im feeding while i was just trying to make t work 1v3........ THAT WAS IT. Something cracked inside me... I respond and he says fuck your mother and then spams with Italian (i guess) and then...BOOM... i became toxic, not super toxic like talking about mother or die etc but still I wont post it here cause im not proud of it.\r\n\r\nResult? Yasuo gets away with it and i get chat restricted and my honour goes down to Level 1.\r\n \r\nI find no reason to play this damn game anymore. There are always trolls, quiters, and spoiled kids creating a mess pre-game, so whats the point? If i'm gona need a bottle of pills after 5 games just to stay composed and avoid a penalty, whats the point? Its pointless, just a waste of time and health. \r\nThanks RIOT!","replies":[{"poster":"Xidphel","date":"2019-04-04T00:39:12.338+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":">lets suspend this guy because he won't bend over and take it like a man!\n\nExcept you sorta did.

Because they successfully provoke people into feeding them, which is their goal. \n\nWhat did you do here? You fed the trolls. \n\nDon't be part of the problem. Don't feed the trolls. The day players like you and me stop reacting to trolling with flames, the trolling dies an ignoble death.","replies":[{"poster":"ionst0rm","date":"2019-04-04T01:32:15.063+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"So you must have a serious complex issue?  Every post under player behavior you speak as if you're an expert in this field.  Doing riot a great deal by putting your two cents in.  Looking for identity in a forum while gaining likes from others who dislike players who speak out about atrocities that aren't being corrected falls under a documented mental illness.  I applaud your consistency.  \n\nIgnoring the problem has never solved anything in the history of mankind.  Wars, gaming, law breakers, sports ectâ€¦  Wanting to just brush it under the carpet is a nomadic principal to follow.  \n\nAllow these players to have an opportunity to speak their mind.   Negating everything said is more oppressive and a big form of fascism.","replies":[{"poster":"iChem","date":"2019-04-04T02:13:23.682+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He isn't all wrong. Ignoring a troll in game and not giving into there baiting has a better impact then feeding into it. They will most likely keep going, but sometimes they stop. Save your replies for the report feature, feeding the troll takes away from there own actions, lowering the chance of them being banned and it puts you at risk for being banned as well.\n\nI had a game today where a Riven was feeding, kept going ham into the enemy team and blaming everyone else for not following her when she was 1/10 lol. She kept flaming us and baiting us trying to start an argument but no one went for it. We lost, and I reported her. Played another game, won the game...when i got out there was a lovely message waiting for me to confirm her punishment.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jo0o","date":"2019-04-04T10:52:52.618+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm on these boards because I like posting on forums, and of the games I play at this time, League PB has the most active forum. I suspect that if WoW Classic is a success, I'll be much less frequent over here. Not much more to it than that, though your attempt to Sherlock me is noted.\n\nYour comparison is completely incorrect. You need to actually examine a problem rather than just picking the most obvious solution. Sure, if an army is at your gates, you can't ignore them. That's a bad metaphor for how to deal with trolling, though. How about an itchy scab that will leave a scar if you insist on picking at it? Or a tiny blackhead that you fuck with and turn into a massive blemish? Or having your computer taken away for a week by your parents for getting a failing grade, then complaining about it so much that they take it away for a month instead? Or getting pulled over by the police for going 7 mph over the speed limit, then giving that cop so much bad attitude that they throw a bunch of secondary offenses at you and get your car towed away?\n\nGetting trolled sucks. You'll very rarely have the opportunity to actually prevent it from happening to you. But flaming the troll exacerbates the problem, for both the person getting trolled and the rest of the community.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"GlHf Muting All","date":"2019-04-04T00:21:06.817+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Let me give you an actual decent answer instead of flaming comments.\n\nIn my opinion, you were in the wrong for a lot of the things said. YES it is frustrating and very annoying from people behaving poorly and immaturely, but you have the control to respond or react like Jo0o said there. In the end it's all about self control from what riot wants. As long as you don't retaliate, you don't get in trouble. I know it's painful and you feel as if you need to let them know they're idiots or etc etc.. But best bet is to mute, ignore and just play it out, and honestly I would encourage rage quitting. Mainly because honestly, it's better to receive time punishment rather than something as severe as flaming since verbal abuse is the biggest looked at bans.\n\nAnd about your teammates arguing and trolling/afking. Let them, don't get yourself involved. If you get screwed over, it's one game, ignore it and brush it off and move on. Just think of it as an auto-loss and there's nothing that literally can be done about it. If they camp you and get you to feed them a lot of kills, it can't be helped. Getting reported for inting also when you weren't inting won't do anything to you. Brush it off. Take my words to thought honestly and not as flaming or lecturing but as advice to help future instances. Trust me, I've been there. I've had over 12 Perm. banned accounts now (Not exaggerating) and even uninstalled this game 3 times.. Nothing new has changed all the times I've came back. Same trolls, same toxics, same cocky players, same bad players. Now I'm on this account and literally doing by it. Once game starts, I mute everyone and just focus and play. Team ints at times or trolls, ignore and just keep playing.\n\nBest of luck and hope you take my words into consideration or even read it fully. If not up to you also.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tham Chundi","date":"2019-04-04T00:55:40.515+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"OMFG is an acroynm many people use without knowing its true meaning it stands for Oh.
