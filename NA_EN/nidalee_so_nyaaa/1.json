This is also made worse by any sort of ping which makes it so an easy as hell to dodge skill shot on LAN or low ping, turns into a strong low chance to dodge skill shot on high ping (50+) that seems to appear and inst hit you.\n\nIts the the same if you had a champion that had the random chance of 1 in 1 million of insta killing an enemy with the next auto, even though it would never happen 999,999 times, that 1 time it would happen will just annoy the other person even if it only happens 1 in the entire game, they would complain how OP it is, even though it rarely happens.\n\n---\n\nI honestly think Nidalee's style is perfect fine, as the concept, of:\n1) Land a slow hard to land skill shot, that weakens the enemy.\n2) Nidalee can jump in and kill/finish off her target \n3) Jump away and repeat it again on another target.\n\nThe problem is that people get annoyed by that 1 javelin landing then her going in, but if she spent all lanning phase throwing 1 million javelins and the enemy standing in minions (cough* playing smart *cough), they never complain at all, it cause her javelin is basically, land it and go in and maybe get a kill and get out or try to poke and get nothing done at all.\n\n---\n\nThere are many champions that can do that far better than Nidalee, and bring a whole lot more to the table than she does, as stated before Azir can poke enemies out (W Q) and then when there low enough go in (E) and also bring team utility with his R.\n\nNidalee however doesn't really offer much, she is known for her \"Poke\" but honestly that was removed with her rework and again there are champions that do that better and easier than her (Ziggs), she then became the land a spear and commit, which honestly didn't work well cause if you landed a masisve long range javalin 99% of the time you were out of range to go in, and even if you could go in, most of the time they are with there team and you going in 1 vs 5 is not a good idea.\n\n---\n\nNidalee honestly needs to be revert to a earlier patch (pre jungler Nidalee) then riot needs to focus on what makes Nidalee, Nidalee and stop with the all lane champion, take her back to the mid/top lane and focus on the aspect of her, that make her, her, weather that be long range hard to land but high damage poke, or maybe get a bit of poke damage and fully engage champion.\n\nHonestly she was fine patch 5.1 but since she was made into the Jungler, Mid, Top, Support champion that could be played literally any lane, then she stopped being able for Riot to focus on her aspects and focus on balancing in her one specific area, and then going with the part of her that make her and then encouraging those aspects as her play style/pattern of play.\n\n---\n\nNidalee was honestly fine (patch 5.1) and she had the 100 or 0 play style, where she either lands a javelin and can go in , and more often than not, maybe kill you, or she can spam 1 million javelins and have the enemy dodge, miss them or Rito bugs, and do nothing cause her entire play style depended on being good with javelins and the enemy not playing around them (such as using the minions etc, to avoid them), she honestly needs to be brought back to her mid lane routes and have her aspects properly focused on and enforced to then re-enforce her play style and how she works and re give her back an identity that make Nidalee, Nidalee.","replies":[{"poster":"Decrit","date":"2015-09-01T19:32:19.200+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=boss10000,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Twtc98fj,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2015-09-01T18:35:26.959+0000)\n>\n> I loved Nidalee way back before you made her into that stupid jungler, she was perfectly balanced before then, the issue you guys created was your own doing, she was fine in the mid lane and the such, because it took skill to land a javelin, that then meant you could engage, the problem you have put her in now is, that she has crap all in her kit to really do anything (except jungle) to a high degree.\n\nsometimes i still cry in my bed thinking about these javelins...","replies":[{"poster":"boss10000","date":"2015-09-01T19:36:24.310+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Decrit,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Twtc98fj,comment-id=000100000000,timestamp=2015-09-01T19:32:19.200+0000)\n>\n> sometimes i still cry in my bed thinking about these javelins...\n\nYou should see some of the javelins i can do on low ping, thread them perfectly through moving minions waves, the amount of times people thought i was hacking cause i could perfect thread javelins, but that was on <20 ping, i miss those days, where you were reward for being a god at skill shots.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Retillin","date":"2015-09-01T18:35:38.181+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"All you need to do, is give a cost to her cougar form.

I feel like the numbers on that would be really interesting. \n\nMy thoughts are that her kit and where Riot is trying to get her kit revolves around getting a mark on an opponent then jumping in for the kill. \n\n\"These changes continue to pressure Nidalee to really commit with cougar-form takedowns, instead of constantly fishing with poke from afar. \" - Patch 5.15\n\nBut if Nidalee players cannot land spears, how can she get a mark which would encourage her to use cougar form as mentioned in the patch? Her traps have a time delay on activation so they cannot be placed under a champion and no player is going to randomly walk over them in lane. Again, not many opportunities to want to commit to cougar form takedowns.\n\nInstead of making spears harder (nearly impossible) to hit why not reduce the damage or increase the mana cost. Lowering damage means no fishing (no more than ezreal and his q's). Higher mana costs means less javelins thrown. Late game mana costs could be run on a similar system as kog'maw or kassadin ult.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Boltrix","date":"2015-09-01T19:04:46.962+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RiotRepertoir,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Twtc98fj,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-09-01T17:43:27.365+0000)\n>\n> Hi there Nidalee SO HOT,\n> \n> Sorry you didn't get a response to your last post; I must have not seen it.

Why not do what DFG and Fizz's ult does, and have the spear be the thing that sets up the combo and promotes damage? Perhaps a larger buff the farther it travels? I mean it can have damage, but the problem is it promotes a cowards game where someone just builds AP, tosses spears until they get one or two kills, and win by a 3v5 proxy.\n\nAt least Fizz has to go in to make his troll combo.\n\nWhich brings me to a way to deal with Fizz: make him vulnerable to being knocked up on his pole. Janna, Yasuo, Alistair? They can knock people up, and Fizz is literally just standing on his pole.\n\nEnd of complaints, counter to Fizz is knockups.\n\n#inb4Yasuorush","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Hugify","date":"2015-09-01T15:39:13.869+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Nidalee's speara were still too powerful,and losing 1/2 of your hp from fog of war was infuriating.\n\nI think they should move her power elsewhere,probably In her leap combo.","replies":[{"poster":"Nidalee SO NYAAA","date":"2015-09-01T15:45:47.200+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Taking away the heal and give her something that fits her.","replies":[]}]}]}
