I have a good 15+ accounts for those two purposes.\n\nIt might become a smurf account though, the one I was using to help teach my friends and other new people the game is getting pretty high level so I need a new one anyways.  Sucks bringing high level people into low level games which is why I play on low leveled accounts while doing it and make sure to play champions I am not familiar with 90% of the time so it isn't as unfair for the enemy team.\n\n(I say this to make it clear that while it may be a smurf account in the sense that a smurf account is any account that isn't your main account I do not use smurf accounts for the purposes that many others do.  I use smurf accounts for reasons purely positive to the community)","replies":[{"poster":"reaperteaser","date":"2017-05-20T06:02:47.376+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"god speed Taric SO HOT","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Demosthentine","date":"2017-05-20T03:25:40.474+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is equal parts adorable and terrifying.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DorkunedAuras","date":"2017-05-19T18:08:13.355+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They're not hopping all over the place incessantly.
