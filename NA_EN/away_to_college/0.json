People are just too toxic and annoying, and when ever they are toxic, they dont get banned and when you say like 1 bad thing, you get banned. Its complete crap in my opinion, so I have a suggestion of getting rid of the chat. I know it will make it so you cant communicate so much, but it will help by people not being toxic. I know this wont get read by any staff members of riot, but I just thought it would be a nice suggestion\r\n-Ty :)","replies":[{"poster":"Zagar","date":"2017-11-20T15:57:44.318+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"/mute all","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-20T02:51:44.508+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We definitely read these posts ^_^!\n\nSomething like this isn't very likely to happen with a team-centric game though. You're welcome to post this idea over in Gameplay or General Discussion where the Devs will have a chance of seeing it, but I don't think it's very likely for chat to be completely removed. Instead, I'd suggest simply dragging the chat window off the screen in your case. This way you won't be provoked by what other people are saying!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Victorious Nasus","date":"2017-11-20T00:18:14.762+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They will read, but I am completely against it if you ask me. Chat is needed, you have a filter and they will eventually get punished.","replies":[]}]}
