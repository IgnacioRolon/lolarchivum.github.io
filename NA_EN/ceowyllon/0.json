I think that if you're at 0LP and haven't gone negative or anything in the past like 3 games you shouldn't get demoted I went from s3 back down to s5 because of teams feeding lanes repetitively and I'm about to got from s4 to s5 again because of people feeding.","replies":[{"poster":"Flamecowz","date":"2014-07-25T22:59:45.549+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot wants there to be a lot of teamwork in League so they make it so if your whole team is feeding, you can still win by working together.  If you sit there raging at your team and complain, than you WILL lose that game.  But if you start talking to them and start coming up with ways to win (like focusing, split pushing, etc) than you can win most of your games.  So overall, they make it so if your team loses, you lose too, no matter how good you did, because if you really DID do good, than you could of won by carrying or teamwork.","replies":[]},{"poster":"InsaneSamurai","date":"2014-07-25T17:59:38.393+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cause the ranking system is mostly luck based.  You still gotta try and play well just in case, but that won't matter more often than not.  With a 5 man team and the game's tendency to set up one sided matches, it's more a crap shoot than anything.","replies":[]},{"poster":"12tales","date":"2014-07-25T15:30:47.096+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Why is it that I can have multiple back to back games where I do well and my team throws yet I lose lp?\n\nBecause your sample size is incredibly small. I don't think a rating system exists that can draw accurate conclusions from just a few games.","replies":[]}]}
