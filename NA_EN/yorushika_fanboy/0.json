I will be in french horn performance program. I really enjoyed the Irelia theme this time.  I cant quite place my finger on it, but i get a classical trained orchestration vibe from this. It felt like there was a attempt to balance western style and asian melodies. Am i correct in my assumption? The fluttering flutes, pentatonic(i think its pentatonic) lines, and the percussion are very asian, but the sustain from everything else(the constant heavy brass and bass sustain), and the explosive climaxes(Huge french horns) scream western Hollywood. I also might think it is because of the western trained orchestra members. (I MIGHT BE TOTALLY WRONG, BUT I CANT SHAKE THE FEELING OFF.) is there any insight that you could give?\n\nalso, I am a huge fan of the fact that you put out the scores you composed online. Scores cost a fortune, and a bunch of them are not available at all(IM LOOK AT YOU FINAL FANTASY) so i really appreciate the ones you've posted. is there a possibility this one will be out too? I would love a PDF so i can analyze and study it(and perhaps have a chance to play it with orchestra friends).","replies":[{"poster":"KuiiwaX","date":"2018-04-10T23:10:49.861+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i was also looking for the composer! I played cello for like 8 years I just cant get over the melody. and yes youre right, the pentatonic lines are well used in here, which made it sound very Asian.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ZOE IS MY GF","date":"2018-12-26T09:58:58.439+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Excuse me sir, may i ask you if you can give us the music sheet ?
