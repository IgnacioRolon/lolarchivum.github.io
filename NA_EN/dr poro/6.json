This one, however, can be completed easily in legitimate games. Yes, you can force it which makes you play suboptimal, but that also goes for getting neutral objectives, placing 50 wards (just stand in base with sightstone and spam away), etc.","replies":[{"poster":"SciFi Scrivener","date":"2017-10-31T19:17:56.720+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot, please give up on the 5 man premade missions.
