But wait, I&#039;m the worst player of my entire team because I only had 19 CS. Forget that I had more gold than Nocturne and midlane Orianna dispite this low CS and forget about my highest kill participation (2nd highest dmg to champs) and lowest death count. I sucked at CSing.\n\nAnd you know why? Because I was in lane with Vel&#039;Koz who cleared waves instantly so that I could easily land my Qs. Our lane synergy was on point and we killed the first turret and inhib BEFORE 2v1 toplane.\n\nYes, it was a 5v4 and I personally think that it&#039;s too easy right now to get S scores in 5v4s (system should take this into account and compare it with other 5v4 games) but I cringe by the fact of how important Riot rates CS **in gamemodes where you&#039;re laning with more than 1 person**. Hexakill, OFA, URF, ARAM and Nemisis draft should not have the same weight in their grade for early CS.\n\nThe game after, I had 14/9/19 on Vladimir. Meh, not as good as the previous game, but still okay. I received S+. Why? Because with 165 CS I had the highest of my team. Good for me. (I actually get S or S+ half the time in this mode, even with shitty KDA, because I usually splitpush.)\n________\n##Make (early game) CS less important for grades when you play in lanes with 2 or more people. The one with waveclear/who is allowed all the farm by their teammates shouldn't get an automatic S+. They'll already have an advantage by having more gold than the rest. Sometimes your role in the team isn't to farm early. But in these game modes, Riot's system doesn't seem to recognize it when players are willingly not going for the CS but giving it to their team instead.","replies":[{"poster":"Handy Sandy ","date":"2016-09-23T21:32:04.436+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":31,"body":"CSing is a skill, and if you aren't good enough at that skill then you don't deserve the high skill grade of an S/S+, it's the main thing that gets you money and early leads.
