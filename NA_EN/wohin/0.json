But recently I have been put onto the lower priority que due to my efforts of loading the game. Every time I click that orange button to lock my champion in I get moved to the loading screen where the percentages are scaling up for each champion. And then you see the champions spawn in, but I do not. My screen changes to show the map, but then freezes at around 4 seconds into the game. The worst part is my whole laptop freezes, I cannot lower or shut down or close the game, no task manager, no ctrl+alt+del, no windows key, nothing. I have to force shutdown every time. Can someone help me? My only connection to why this might be happening, was when I was creating a custom match and hit the 'Add Bot' button, it said disconnected from PVP.net Servers.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-02T23:55:34.312+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you're having the game freeze issue that some players have reported after a recent Windows 10 update.  The culprit here may be specifically with the [Xbox Game Bar](http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8637-game-bar-turn-off-windows-10-a.html).  Disabling that should get this fixed!","replies":[]}]}
