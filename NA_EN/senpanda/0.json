This is intended.\n\nYou guys should really leave it in the game.\n\nI mean, I have tried to edit my sound files before, and I know what a clusterfuck it is to find anything, let alone edit anything, but you guys should make the effort to add that 3rd music option to the dropdown menu anyway.\n\nOn a related note: the age of your client and out-dated code are really showing themselves, when your sound guys literally replace the \"classic SR\" music for the event instead of just adding a 3rd option in the menu to select Bilgewater. The fact that the \"quick fix\" of doing that was easier than actually doing it properly... Is kinda sad. The fact that it might have taken them hours to do it properly because of the clusterfuck of code and mismanaged file organization known as the League of Legends game client makes ME sad :(. You guys really need to rewrite the game from the ground up if it's so hard to do such simple things, and you literally use hacks and quick-fixes to set up all the temp files for the event.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Thryale","date":"2015-08-11T02:18:50.229+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"\\*puppy dog eyes\\*\n\nCan we plz has teh moosic backs?
