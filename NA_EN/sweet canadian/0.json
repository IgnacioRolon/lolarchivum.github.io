Maybe it is not important for some of you but for me it is important, at some point. I paid extra rp for that card. Can someone from riot or the development team do something about it ? Like edit the splash art to make cards a bit smaller ?","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-11-17T02:06:48.160+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Sweet Canadian,\n\nThanks so much for bringing this to our attention!
