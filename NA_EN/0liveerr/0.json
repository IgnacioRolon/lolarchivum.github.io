And then I saw something.. My most expensive champs and skins have been refunded, and I didn't get any RP. So this guy somehow refunded my 3 most expensive skins and gifted it to himself.. I looked this guy up and he was on my blocked list. Please help me, what shall I do to get my skins back? I've changed my password. When I think back I remember I clicked on a link from probably him. Please what should I do? Im scared and I need help ;(","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-21T22:50:46.165+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We gotchu fam, no worries! That's sounds pretty shitty overall if someone was able to hack your account and refund skins!! Hit up our account agents in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new), and they'll be able to confirm when it happened and repair any damage done in that time.","replies":[]}]}
