Its a ridiculous but the automated system finds this to be slightly negative.  Never type \"gg\" \"ggwp\" or \"ff\" 3 or more times in a game this is also a trigger if you do this often (I know this didnt happen here, but just be aware).  The system also hates one word, quickly typed sentences.  So if you type one word and hit enter very fast.  The system will assign this a small negative value (I think it considers it spam).    \n\nAnyway, just assume your teammates are going to report you every single game you are losing.  As you can see the automated system is a mess and always has been.  You will probably get this overturned if you didn't hide anything.  But, just be aware the system is hyper sensitive and to just avoid typing at all.  Typing baron is up or lets fight for drake.  Obviously, not going to trigger.

Because of that they often look for any perceived error in the system as evidence for it being broken or whatever and accuse any who say otherwise as being a \"sensitive snowflake\" or \"insert insult here\". Your case may just be an example of a very rare false positive assuming you're being 100% truthful*, hence why they're latching onto it as \"proof\" of a flawed and broken system.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with bantering with others provided you don't take it too far and know when to stop. In some of my games I talk quite a bit, sometimes even joking around with my teammates and I have yet to receive any kind of punishment whatsoever. When it comes to \"Ez\" the IFS is smart enough to know the difference between the champion name and other uses. For example, \"ggez\" is considered unsportsmanlike &amp; can contribute to a possible punishment if there's other more problematic behavior displayed, though rarely on its own. On the flipside, \"gj ez\" wouldn't be considered bad on its own.\n\nAlso when it comes to cussing, it only becomes a problem when directed at others, which you didn't do in this case.\n\nJust wait for the Support ticket to finish up then post it here in its unedited entirety. Hopefully then we can figure out what's really going on here.\n\n*Forgive my skepticism, but since people have been known in the past to lie about and/or even withhold, edit and/or make up information about their cases in order to fit their own narrative I have to take cases like this with a grain of salt.","replies":[{"poster":"makeemrun","date":"2020-01-15T20:13:48.378+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I posted screenshots of the chat logs.
