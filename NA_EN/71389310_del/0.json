Requested","subforum":"Concepts & Creations","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"If you can get a discount on a bundle because you own one or more skins in it shouldn't that concept should apply to Chroma Packs ( CP ) as well? I own Garen but would have to pay full price for his CP ( I don't intend to buy Garen's CP but I noticed upon clicking it that I don't get a discount ) and I've noticed this same result when clicking on the CP for both Master Yi and Nasus. I guess this is more of a thread regarding the concept of how skins/CP are sold as opposed to a concept for a new skin but I couldn't decide the best place to ask on the Boards. I'd welcome a response from Riot explaining this too if anybody working feels they have the time.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-10-16T20:30:46.258+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"Hey StefNBennett,\n\nWe aren't currently offering discounts on chroma packs. While they're living in the 'Bundles' section, they're not the same as the sale bundles you see rotate through the shop. Chroma packs are permanently in the store. \n\n If you're purchasing one of the Team Championship bundles, the RP amount will decrease if you own some of the content in the bundle. For chroma packs, they're currently sold at a flat rate of 590 RP, and you would need to own the champion or the champion + skin in cases like Pool Party Leona.","replies":[{"poster":"71389310_DEL","date":"2015-10-16T20:36:18.535+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for responding, RiotKateyKhaos.\n\nWhat you said and the way you explained it makes a bit of sense but I'd like to pose a hypothetical just to make sure I'm 100% understanding you: If I were to buy Fizz or Dreadknight Nasus ( I already own Nasus ) the price of the CP would drop from their current price down to 590 RP?\n\nFuture edit: KK Cruisin answered the hypothetical for me in a different post ( see quote below ) on this thread.
