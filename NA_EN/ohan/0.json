League is the only game that does this and I don't understand why. I uninstalled and completely reinstalled the game to see if it would stop then but it didn't. I also reinstalled OBS and the problem still occured.\r\n\r\nAny help is appreciated. I'll try to respond to any questions a soon as I can. &lt;3","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-26T03:24:57.664+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not entirely sure how OBS is impacted by league personally, as I haven't used that streaming software myself. If you're having issues with OBS I'd suggest reaching out to their support for the most accurate and best help with their software!","replies":[{"poster":"Ohan","date":"2018-01-26T04:58:54.729+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well after a bit of messing around I decided to use Xsplit to see if it was actually OBS's fault. Xsplit had the exact same problem except when a game of league opened the stream stopped entirely. But yeah I'm going to the OBS forums too to check. It just confuses me, because its only league and both my streaming softwares have issues with league even though i've streamed way more intense games.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-26T05:04:20.679+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Off the top of my head, it could honestly just be caused if OBS and League are eating up all of your processing power/ram and is slowing down your entire pc when both are running. I'm not 100% sure on this, of course, just a general guess. You could also reach out to our techs in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) to see if they've got any suggestions!","replies":[]}]}]}]}
