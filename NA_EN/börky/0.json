(&gt;.&gt;) {{champion:92}} \r\nSo if you needed to retreat, the minions move out of the way! IT&#039;S FULL PROOF!!!!!!\r\n\r\nSome of you might be asking; &#039;&#039;But beautiful and amazing Borky, what if the minions were attacking?&#039;&#039;\r\nAn easy and simple solution, the minions would cancel their autos and not deal any damage to the enemy or enemy creeps while you run.. I mean tactical retreat.\r\nThat would be the price you&#039;d have to pay, a slight advancement of enemy creeps.\r\n\r\nOf course, this wouldn&#039;t apply to champions who can go through minions from some ability or item.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the creeps would use their eyes (OwO they have eyes, amazing) to move out of your way and in consequence cancel their attacks.\r\nPersonally, I think this would be the best solution without it harming the game too much. Of course, people would have to program things and whatnot, but that&#039;s their jobs... Upvoting this would be a real treat. maybe (and hopefully) the devs at Rito would see this remarkable solution and implement it into the game, please support this \r\n{{sticker:sg-lux}}","replies":[{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2017-10-16T04:52:08.875+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">An easy and simple solution, the minions would cancel their autos and not deal any damage to the enemy or enemy creeps while you run\n\nThen people would abuse it to freeze the wave by preventing your minions from attacking the enemy's.
