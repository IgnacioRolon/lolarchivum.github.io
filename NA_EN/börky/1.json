These 2 fellas {{champion:75}}  {{champion:45}}  will give you around 20 minutes to end the game before they become too strong for you to handle, no matter the numbers.&#039;&#039; \r\n\r\nGod forbid you get both these cucks in one game. Depending on your play style, you&#039;re either going to have a little resistance or completely shut down. You&#039;re going to be made into their little bitch if you don&#039;t close the game before they get irreversibly strong. And good luck having any gameplay if you&#039;re squishy, i.e ADCs and most mid laners (and some junglers and top laners). Riot should just make them stack like kindred, which is why I didn&#039;t mention her in this even tho she also stacks. make it a certain amount of farm at a time and not all of it.","replies":[{"poster":"Tenth Leper","date":"2017-10-22T05:44:15.215+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I kind of see where you are coming from (though I quite enjoy Veigar).

So anyone can be a timebomb if they want to be.
