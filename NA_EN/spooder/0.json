Today I tried to play a normal game, I joined the queue and got into a game. I selected my hero, but at the moment the game started (Right when the hero select timer reached 0) I got disconnected. I tried to press reconnect but nothing happened. It simply didnt work. Due to \"Leaving the match\" I got into the low priority queue. I waited a while until the game I was disconnected from ended, and tried to join another game, and the same thing happens. \nI would like to note that my internet works fine and Im too scard to join a new game until the issue is solved. Is this a known problem?\nthanks for your help.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-07T01:37:17.191+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like your network was having a hard time switching your connection over to the game server you were going to be playing on. If you weren't able to reconnect either, there might have been something blocking that connection from getting through altogether. I'd suggest checking up on your [**network settings**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to make sure everything is still in order there, and test the changes out in a custom or practice game just to be safe!","replies":[]}]}
