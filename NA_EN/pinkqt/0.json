Does anyone know how to fix it? Please let me know if you do, thx.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-04T19:38:49.542+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The disconnections were likely being caused by a network problem so reinstalling wouldn't necessarily resolve it.  I recommend going over each step of the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to resolve issues specifically reaching our servers.  This way the updated client can connect to the patching servers and complete the update without errors.  I hope that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"pinkqt","date":"2017-01-05T22:31:44.907+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks, just yesterday I was using the old client and there were no problems for some reason","replies":[]}]}]}
