It stills happens that I can't ban or accept the game so it treats me as an afk... Really annoying and it happens to all of my friends too. Are they going to leave it like that or they are fixing it?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-01T03:30:30.487+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If your client isn't sending those bans and picks it's due to your connection being a little unstable and not being able to communicate with our servers quickly enough to send that info.
