Not to mention that her ult requires a good amount of synergy to use effectively. If you can use her and especially if you duo often then she's better.\n\nJinx on the other hand is incredibly solid. You can't go wrong as jinx. More damage and she's fairly safe do to her range","replies":[]},{"poster":"FedAsFuk","date":"2015-05-02T23:36:27.824+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would say Jinx, as it sounds like you are newer to the game with only playing Ashe as far as ADCs. Jinx is alot easier to play than Kalista, requiring less mechanics and general game knowledge to build her properly, as her build changes drastically based on the team comp, the enemy team comp, the state of the game, who is and isn't fed. Jinx is much more linear, making her the better choice until you learn alot more about the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"aaronautumn","date":"2015-05-02T22:43:08.438+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"play whichever one the situation calls for","replies":[]}]}
