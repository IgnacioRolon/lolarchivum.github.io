If there was a buff on it's damage against minions I feel it would be bought more often without making it too strong in champion vs champion interactions. It would also help tanks make their way back into play in top lane more often and not have to be banished quite as much to the jungle.","replies":[]},{"poster":"stochastic42","date":"2016-01-26T04:57:58.236+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"I agree that deadmans is strong right now but considering that Frozen Heart and Thornmail were both nerfed significantly, and as was mentioned Randuin's is rarely a good item for lane due to it's new crit blocking passive, it's not surprising that it's outshining the competition.\n\nAlso as you mentioned it is outshining even hp/damage and hp/mr defensive items largely due to the fact that health is an effective way to mitigate magic damage in the early/mid game and because often the champions that build it have everything they need in their kit to win fights and just need the mobility to engage without completely sacrificing tankiness. nearly any melee champion with deadman's can 1v1 any ADC with ease.\n\nAnother reason it's strong is because it makes tier 2 boots unnecessary allowing you to get an early second item and still be able to engage. It also helps you get back to lane quickly which will often make a significant impact. Between all this it's very hard to beat as a first item for any non-carry top laner.\n\nPerhaps the solution is to change the speed boost to an active so it's not providing the extra utility (roaming speed and getting to lane fast) which is out of scope for the item.

You significantly dwarf my expertise on the subject, but I still think that it is worth noting that if you agree that Sunfire/Randuin's both need a pass-over, but you believe that Deadman's is too strong, isn't Riot's approach to do one set of changes at a time, let data from live roll in (because PBE is inadequate) and then follow up again if necessary?\n\nThis is why people got upset with the Sejuani nerfs, because they were delivered hand-in-hand with Cinderhaulk nerfs, so she got the double nerf bat. I think it might be prudent to make one set of changes first, let the dust settle, and then use the \"new environment\" where Randuin's and Sunfire are in a better state to make the decision about how much/if to nerf Deadman's.\n\nPeople pick Deadman's because it has reliable utility, and is a nice statball. Randuin's has \"unreliable\" utility, as does Frozen Heart (Aura ranges, activatable, stats are basically \"negating stats\" which work to whittle down your opponent's strengths) where Deadman's is just a set of positive stats (MS, AR, Health, all of which positively impact you 100% of the time).\n\nIf you increase reliability (f the intended goals of FZ, and Randuin's specifically) you should be able to increase their power but not in a way that invalidates mages (agreed, health stacking wrecks mages). Potentially, buffs to the aura's or \"bonus effects\" of Randuin's, FZ, (and a flat-out re-imagining of Sunfire) seem like a much healthier way to balance Deadman's.\n\nI'm simply trying to implore you to entertain alternative methods to the same goal, of having healthy and balanced Juggernaut items, with diversity most of all.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Amicaze","date":"2016-01-26T07:18:39.201+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think you widely underestimate the value of mobility.

It's crowding out not just other armor options but other defensive options period, which points to it simply giving more for its price than items usually give.\n\nMy Thoughts on Armor Choices\n\n{{item:3068}}  1) Sunfire Cape gives invisible power that feels unsatisfying & that's hardly noticeable. Unless they sit on you for a very long time it won't do much & even then it's not all that great. As of now it's only really good for waveclear & combining with Thornmail.\n\n{{item:3143}}  2) Randuin's Omen is a niche item to use versus a lot of crit & attack speed. It's usually better to get this later because most tops don't have ton of either of those things. Also, as others have said, it's more satisfying to speed yourself up always rather than slow others down for a few seconds in a small ring.\n\n{{item:3075}}  3) Thornmail is good versus a lot of attack speed and to some extent life steal (untill they get omega amounts in which case they heal through the damage). Again, very niche, especially when you consider it benefits from you already having armor to make the return damage higher. Best versus a full ad team and synergizes well with Sunfire Cape/Cinderhulk.\n\n{{item:3110}} 4) Not gonna lie, Frozen Heart is kinda lack luster. In exchange a for mana & a static attack speed debuff aura you have to sacifice health & crit reduction. It is basically an item for people that can't live without the extra mana because Randuin's Omen is just better all around as a tank item (like Deadman's Plate is to...literally everything). It's also an aura which feels less satisfying to have just like Sunfire Cape's burn.\n\n{{item:3512}} What in the Burning Hells is this thing? I think I saw someone take it...once...on Anivia.....for shits and giggles....\n\n{{item:3025}} It's great as an alternative to Triforce so you don't get 1-shot for building a sheen item. If this item gave health it'd be straight up broken because that's the only trade off I see here. Seriously, why is **this** not being talked about more in terms of balance?\n\n{{item:3742}} Let's you move faster all the time, has decent health and armor, doesn't require the enemy to be already next to me to help against all the kite I'm fighting.........yeah fuck everything other tank item. Unless I'm fighting a Yasuo, Tryndamere, & a few marksmen at the same time why **would** I take anything else? All joking aside, Deadman's Plate is the apex of anti-kite tank items & that's not all that bad really. It made playing tanks/fighters/juggernauts/etc feel so much better in \"League of Mobility\" that it's understandable that all other items fall short by comparison. Nerfing Deadman's Plate too harshly would cripple not only the 4 reworked juggernauts, but also every other low mobility champion in the game. Perhaps reconsidering the \"Crushing Blow\" portion of the item would be a sufficient nerf for the diversity gods? If I'm being objective, speeding up yourself & slowing down others is a bit much.","replies":[{"poster":"hopeful4","date":"2016-01-26T04:17:53.324+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":">As of now it's only really good for waveclear \n\n Because that is supposed to be its niche lol.

As for thornmail, you basically need to be a tank to use it, due to the requirement of stacking more armor. Frozen heart gives good stats, however mana isn't worth itemizing on a lot of champions that want to be tankier outside of actual tanks (Ex.  rek'sai, garen, mundo, morde, etc.) Essentially deadmans plate is the best option of the group for the majority of champions due to the somewhat exclusive nature of the other armor items.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"shadowsaotome","date":"2016-01-26T03:16:56.293+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot Axes,realm=NA,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=fWOVQoin,comment-id=00060000,timestamp=2016-01-26T02:58:22.929+0000)\n>\n> I'd like to look at Randuin's Omen and Sunfire Cape as well.

AP Juggernauts have very few itemization options. While AD-based Juggernauts can make use of multiple options like Dead Man's Plate, Black Cleaver, Titanic Hydra, and even items like Frozen Mallet, Iceborn Gauntlet, and Sterak's Gage. AP Juggernauts have very few options overall, let's take a look.\n\n{{item:3116}} : One of the very few solid AP Juggernaut items, essentially the Black Cleaver for AP champs. Solid stats, a good passive, and makes its way into plenty of AP Juggernaut builds. Occasionally picked up by full mages, but causes no major abuse cases where it becomes a must-buy for non-Juggernaut champions.\n\n{{item:3151}} : A decent option, works well together with Rylai's, but always feels a bit like overkill unless you're really ahead. Provides less raw HP and AP than Rylai's, and though the Pen is nice, AP Juggernauts usually do enough damage that they rarely need it, and if enemies are actually building consistent MR, it would usually be better to just get a Void Staff for raw damage, even though you lose out on some HP for it.\n\n{{item:3027}} : At first glance it seems great! Scaling HP and AP, along with Mana? Good stuff! Except... well, one of the primary AP Juggernauts, Mordekaiser, doesn't use Mana at all, making it a wasteful option for the big guy. He's your poster-boy for AP Juggernauts, and will NEVER want to buy this.\n\n{{item:3001}}  and {{item:3157}} : Both of these seem like great options. Solid resists, backed up by powerful passives, and nice chunks of AP. This is great... except everyone else is going to buy them even more than Juggernauts. Abyssal is more often purchased by assassins, melee-range AP burst champions. While Zhonyas is purchased by... well, everyone. Seriously, the item is STILL one of the best defensive AP items in the game, and almost every AP champion who is worried about getting hurt is going to buy the thing.\n\n{{item:3060}} : This is the only item left with both HP and AP.

Thanks a lot for this thread. As a \"Juggernaut main\" (I played a lot of Garen, Mundo, I was one of the few advocates for Mordekaiser bot on the forums, and even if they are not all proper Jugg, I played a lot of other tanky dudes [and dudesses :p]), I have a few questions.\n\n1. About Udyr: is he really considered a Juggernaut internally? He has huge MS, a stun, and lifesteal (which discourage from building HPs, as mentioned in a later point).\n\n2. And what about Mundo? Despite his ranged poke, I'd say he is a Juggernaut. If he is not, what is he? Because he's definitely not a Tank with just one slow, and not the most efficient of Divers either.

Thanks a lot for this thread. As a \"Juggernaut main\" (I played a lot of Garen, Mundo, I was one of the few advocates for Mordekaiser bot on the forums, and even if they are not all proper Jugg, I played a lot of other tanky dudes [and dudesses :p]), I have a few questions.\n> \n> 1. About Udyr: is he really considered a Juggernaut internally? He has huge MS, a stun, and lifesteal (which discourage from building HPs, as mentioned in a later point).\n\nI wouldn't say that Udyr in his current state is a Juggernaut - just that he shares enough properties that he's in the same general space, so he naturally tends to come up when we're talking about Juggernaut items.\n \n> 2. And what about Mundo? Despite his ranged poke, I'd say he is a Juggernaut. If he is not, what is he? Because he's definitely not a Tank with just one slow, and not the most efficient of Divers either. And yet if he is a Juggernaut, he doesn't build their items, mostly full durability, and if he builds offense, it's more magic-damage-oriented (1 or 2 among Rylai/Lyandry/Abyssal/Witt's end).\n\nMundo feels like a Juggernaut to me, but that's my opinion, I wouldn't say that it represents some kind of internal consensus.\n\n> 3. Which transitions well with my next question: there are very few magic-damage Juggernaut/Bruiser items. It's obviously a problem for Mordekaiser, but even beyond that, its a hole in the itemization system, and it could open a lot of diversity in type of champs and buildpaths available, especially for guys like Rumble, I think. Is there any plan to add new items in this direction, or rework some of the existing items to gear them more toward AP Bruisers? There is probably something cool to be done with Rylai/Lyandry/Abyssal/Witt's End/Sunfire, and yet I cannot think of a single champ who would actually wish to build that stuff.\n\nThe big question for me on \"AP Bruiser\" is that it's not clear that we're talking about any real class of champions. Names I hear include stuff like Mordekaiser (hybrid stats Juggernaut), Rumble (AP damage dealer who buys minimal tank stats), and Maokai/Singed (more or less straight up tanks). I could imagine doing an AP Bruiser item if it's clear that it's supporting a decent set of champions who share an itemization need, but most of the ideas in that space that I've heard pitched end up being an item for just one or two champions since these champs don't really share many properties other than \"fighter-ish and scales off AP\".\n \n> 4. About Stat Binding working: aren't Tanks using Deadman's Plate too much? Or Sunfire? And by the way, can you confirm that Black Cleaver and Sunfire are actually considered as Jugg Items, and not Tanks Items (despite not being the 3 added items you mentioned)? And Randuin, with the utility actives and the crit reduction is more a Tank item, despite the HPs, right?\n\nBlack Cleaver, Sunfire Cape, and Randuin's Omen are all definitely in the space of Juggernaut items. Sunfire Cape and Randuin's Omen are also used by Tanks, while Black Cleaver crosses over with all manner of non-Juggernaut Fighters (and a few AD Assassins). This kind of crossover is perfectly fine.\n\nThe reason we care about stat bindings is that if we can ensure that Juggernauts are actually the core users of a particular item, we're able to balance the item around them instead of some other champion that just plain abuses it better. The reason we're calling this a successful demonstration for stat bindings is that we believe that it demonstrates that we're able to bind these items when we need to. Sterak's Gage in particular was successful in that regard.\n\nRe: Dead Man's Plate: I think that's a problem with DMP being simply too powerful for its cost, not a problem with its stats profile.\n\n> 5. About the \"Known Tradeoff\": does this label mean that it won't be improved in the (near) future? Not that I'm complaining, but it's kinda ambiguous what you mean there.\n\nIn this case, I mean that we think we'd have to take on another fairly major project - at around the preseason Marksman itemization scope (which was much larger than the Juggernaut items scope) - to improve it enough to call it done.\n \n> 6. About Titanic Hydra: IMHO, the intended users should be: Volibear, Mundo, Udyr, Darius, and potentially reworked Nasus/Olaf with a better binding with health. All of them have a kit centered around basic attacks, with resets/AS buff/aa-enhancers. The problem for Nasus and Olaf is that their lifesteal encourages them to build resistances more than hps. (But you are probably aware of that already ^^'). And why allow to swap between Titanic and Ravenous freely? This seems a bit odd, and unfair compared to Smite/Boots/Zeal upgrades/Sheen upgrades/etc.\n\nWith a few changes that's more or less the list I had in mind (Trundle and Shyvana might be candidates, not sure it'd make so much sense on Udyr in his current form), but as you've probably noticed they all would need a few tweaks to really consider Titanic a core item. That's the exact concern with the item - its niche is so specific that it almost doesn't exist.\n\nRe: the swapping: It's a bit of a thematic nod (they're configurations of the same weapon), but not ultimately crucial to the items. I rather like it but it's definitely odd and I understand why there's concern about it. I don't know if it'll stay or not.\n\n> 7. About Deadman's Plate: can't you buff the alternatives instead of nerfing it, just like you did with Thunderlord recently? If not, why is it a different case?\n\nIn Thunderlord's case, our thought was that the other Keystones had been left in a bad enough spot that nerfing Thunderlords would just leave Keystones feeling terrible across the board - none of the options was close enough to feel even ok about and we didn't have a ton of time to build confidence in buffs to them.\n\nWith Randuin's/Sunfire, they're items that players have appreciated in the past, which gives us quite a bit of confidence that some tweaks will make them desirable again. We'll likely try to float up both of those items in the near future. As I've said elsewhere in this thread, however, I think Dead Man's Plate is too strong for an item in League of Legends given its cost, not just for an armor item, and I don't think we can possibly buff Sunfire and Randuins enough to compete with Dead Man's without just making champions that use both overpowered.\n \n> I'll appreciate any answer, even partial ;) Once again, thanks for this thread, and thanks to Riot for the Dev Corner in general.\n\nThanks for the questions!","replies":[{"poster":"Godman873","date":"2016-01-26T07:07:21.799+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot Axes,realm=NA,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=fWOVQoin,comment-id=000b0000,timestamp=2016-01-26T05:05:17.567+0000)\n> \n> The big question for me on \"AP Bruiser\" is that it's not clear that we're talking about any real class of champions.

Aside from maybe one or two of these guys, they're all very focused around sustained damage and fighting for a longer duration than most APs can or at least are focused around sustaining themselves for a long time in a fight with most of these characters also utilizing basic attacks (vlad and swain don't while singed and zac can use them for filler.)\n\nIf you say 'oh they're just fighter like' then isn't {{champion:266}} just a bruiser that fights like a marksman? Or {{champion:64}} being a fighter that fights like an AD caster? \n\nI can't imagine they would be easy to balance but I am sure it could be done, specific characters such as Maokai, Mordekaiser, Swain and Rumble would benefit greatly from being able to deal damage and take punishment in response. It could also open up midlane to be more welcome to ADs as opposed to soloqueue ending up with things such as AD top, AD mid, ADC with support and tank jungle being only magic DPS. It feels better to play Galio than Maokai because you don't have to choose between Damage or survivability. Most of the characters such as Evelynn and mordekaiser also struggle to find a use beyond damage if they fall behind so when are able to build both some survivability and DPS they're able to at least attempt a teamfight as opposed to instantly exploding or standing the middle of a teamfight being useless. The only thing keep some of those characters in a decent spot is %hp damage tied onto their kit by default (which starts making me think %hp mechanics are a desperate attempt to help a character deal damage would be better off with flat AP damage in their kit. %HP mechanic as a whole seems to be overly abundant nowadays, heck 7 of the characters in that list have %HP damage and also 7 that are difficult to balance because there are no real items for them.)\n\n\"But if we build items then mages might use them.\" Okay, so lower the AP they give. Most end build AP items should have 80-120 AP. \n\n\"But what if those characters just build full AP?\" Most of them are melee, they will instantly explode and if they're playable as AP like {{champion:131}} then why not embrace non toxic off builds?\n\nAnd if both didn't work, why not do what you did for Melee AD and make Melee AP items? The distinction between melee and ranged AP has been done before on Twisted treeline with Moonflair spellblade.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Raxistaicho","date":"2016-01-26T03:43:30.942+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"So if you're looking at Udyr, are you considering Shyvana as well?

Some suggestions to improve his stat binding:\n\nTurtle Stance - basic attacks restore a bit of bonus health instead of lifesteal, maybe 1%.\n\nInstead of a shield, it gives armor and MR (makes health more useful)\n\nShield is a % of his max health (like Sion)\n\nTiger Stance - Instead of bonus physical damage based on AD, have Tiger Stance apply on-hit effects twice (doesn't stack with Sated Devourer). This would give him more use out of BoRK with less AD (more room to build health if he has a lower dependence on life steal) and also inspire the same synergy with Titanic Hydra that Renekton has.\n\nBear Stance - Maybe remove the collision ignore and the gap closer to make him feel more like a juggernaut, and give the stun an extra .25 second duration to make the reward for catching enemies better since you also made it harder.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Adalore","date":"2016-01-26T02:41:45.062+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"On the case of deadman's plate it's probably less that it's super good but the contested choice of \"Sunfire cape\" being less of a choice.\n\nWhile I know it's hard to weigh deadman's vs Sunfire, that IS the choice going down between champions.
