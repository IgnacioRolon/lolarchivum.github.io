That&rsquo;s very different from how the game has historically been played, where a team with a lead can count on building an even larger lead just by farming and controlling the map, while a team which is falling behind typically doesn&rsquo;t really catch back up by defending their towers. This is definitely a philosophical shift in how advantages are pressed or a game of League is won (particularly at the competitive level), but we think it&rsquo;s a goal worth pursuing for this season, and are hoping these changes are a push in the right direction.\r\n\r\nFor the actual changes: the short version is that the minions of a team with a level advantage become slightly more powerful against enemy minions, dealing more damage and taking less damage to enemy lane minions. These advantages are increased in lanes where the advantaged team has killed more turrets than the disadvantaged team. \r\n\r\nBy giving an advantage to the winning team&rsquo;s minions, we change who has to take action to win &ndash; if you&rsquo;re behind, more of the gold on the map comes to you, so you&rsquo;ll tend to catch up rather than fall slowly further behind. If you&rsquo;re ahead, however, you get more opportunities to siege towers. Out of control snowball games will potentially end faster through successful sieges, but teams that are behind should have a more realistic chance of coming back through successful defensive play.\r\n\r\nWe&rsquo;re starting with this tuned pretty light - these gains are tuned primarily by level advantage (the team with the higher average level gains the minion buff), with an additional increase based on the number of turrets downed in the lane. Minion damage is quite low, so while talking about percentages might seem high, the numerical impact is fairly low. The formula&rsquo;s currently tuned at (5% + (5% x number of turrets downed)) x average level advantage). That&rsquo;s about a 15% damage bonus for minions against minions if your team is, on average, 1 full level above the opposition. \r\n\r\nDamage reduction is a little more straightforward: 1 + (number of turrets downed x average level advantage). So, in total, if you&rsquo;re 1 level ahead and 2 turrets up in a given lane, your minions deal 15% more damage to enemy minions and take 3 less damage from enemy minions.\r\n\r\nIn close games, we&rsquo;ve seen the average level advantage go between 0.2 - 0.4 average levels. Minions which normally hit for about 30 will have their damage increased by less than 1 &ndash; the effect is rarely noticeable. If that still sounds like a lot, consider that we have powerful comeback mechanics in place for levels &ndash; if your team is 1 level behind on average, the game probably feels significantly snowballed; if you&rsquo;re 2 levels behind, you&rsquo;re probably being crushed. So far, we have seen *very* few games get to 3 levels behind because, by that point, you&rsquo;re either getting mega-stomped (think 18 minute game end) or catch-up mechanics will quickly rubberband you with *large* amounts of bonus XP.\r\n\r\nI did want to address a few concerns we&rsquo;ve heard &ndash;\r\n\r\nWe agree that you should be able to know what&rsquo;s going on with your minions and we&rsquo;re actively working on ensuring that you can tell the state of your minions in game. It&rsquo;s going to be pretty subtle, but it won&rsquo;t be totally hidden. Not sure exactly when that will ship - as soon as we can have it finished.\r\n\r\nWe&rsquo;ve heard the concerns that this devalues lane manipulation skills such as freezing and slow pushing. Real talk, it probably does reduce the value of those skills &ndash; but it does not eliminate them, and it does make other skills (like coordinated rotations) more valuable at the same time. In particular, in close games it&rsquo;ll work about the same. Freezing a lane with these changes when you&rsquo;re behind is easier; when you&rsquo;re significantly ahead, it&rsquo;s much harder. Slow pushing shouldn&rsquo;t be that different except in extreme cases &ndash; it tends to create a situation where you have a 2-to-1 advantage in number of minions or more, which easily outweighs the amount of power from the new mechanics.\r\n\r\nFinally, there&rsquo;s a lot of concern about how stompy and snowbally the game is, and whether this will make that worse. We agree that there&rsquo;s a problem with early game snowballing, and 5.23 has a number of changes (notably tower health increases and less experience gained for killing an enemy) that should help that problem a lot. If these changes make that experience worse, we will follow up, whether by pulling back on these changes or by working on other mechanics.\r\n\r\nWe&rsquo;re definitely keeping an eye on all of this and we didn&rsquo;t make these changes lightly, so I hope you&rsquo;ll try them out and let us know how things go.","replies":[{"poster":"Stonington","date":"2015-11-21T07:26:27.288+0000","up_votes":21,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your theory and intent behind the minion changes is sound and I've seen people argue for it before. Back in season 3 and prior, once you took a single inhibitor minions in all lanes would get stronger and every lane would automatically push. I remember quite clearly, taking one inhib would be a huge event that would tip the scales in favour of your team winning dramatically. Not to sound melodramatic, but it would be a watershed moment in every game you'd play. The winning team would be able to ward the entire map freely, take all the jungle camps, and easily take baron dragon at their discretion. Players back then would sometimes make the same argument you are. 'All the lanes are pushing and the losing team will have the opportunity to catch up and get more gold than the winning team.' That would never happen though. Once all the minions put pressure on the map it was basically an auto win scenario. So in season 4 they removed this feature in efforts to prevent snowballing.\n\nI don't see any reason why winning teams won't group as 5 in a single lane and just wait for their side lane minions to auto push the outer towers to force the losing team into a lose-lose scenario. They either defend the side lanes and pray the 5 man advantage doesn't dive them, they allow their side lane turrets to fall, or they forced to take an engage onto the winning team. This is how you would win every game in season 3 with one inhib down.\n\nWith that said, why do you think the changes you're proposing will be any different from season 3?","replies":[{"poster":"ICantNameMe","date":"2015-11-22T00:25:38.523+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Inhibitors increased the HP and damage of every minion agnostically, i.e. they were tankier and dealt more damage against turrets and champions too. These changes only apply to minions; they do not make the minions harder to clear for champions or turrets. Yes, it is significant that this pushing change impacts all lanes, but from the OP, it seems to only be noticeable if your team is significantly behind (losing at least 2 lanes, towers down, etc.). If the winning team just groups as 5 in a single lane, that doesn't stop you from pushing the lane before they reach your tower. Just because the enemy minions are stronger doesn't mean you can't push a lane out, it just means you have to hard push instead of attempting to slow push. Regardless, I feel like it's too early to tell how this will actually affect the game without seeing it in action first. If it's not working as intended, I'm sure Riot will tune it to accomplish its intended goal (as a comeback mechanism).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mishli","date":"2015-11-24T16:22:22.840+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i honestly completely forgot that inhibs used to do that, one of the lesser known things in the early seasons. i honestly just feel paranoid that these changes are going to make the losing team just lose harder, as they either have to always put someone in that lane to collect the minions/xp and protect the tower, thus being a man short around any objectives, or they lose towers while trying to contest an objective after a pick where they might have an advantage. i do think, in a good way, the minions more often being on your side may help some people to overextend less and maybe they will be able to scale up? i'm really on the fence with what might be coming","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2015-11-21T02:58:35.304+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":7,"body":"I look forward to how it all balances out by the time the 2016 Season starts.

The minions will push away from him naturally, allowing the already-winning opposing laner to gain an even larger lead. Similar stuff can happen in mid and bot, where a losing lane becomes even more difficult to survive because your team happens to have a higher level advantage.\n\nI feel like this is a band-aid fix, similar to when Riot made top and mid towers take less damage early to prevent pros from lane swapping. It works in theory, but it's a really lazy way to fix a problem.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BADxW0LF","date":"2015-11-21T04:49:26.065+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"One thing you didn't address is how much gold difference you are adding to those who are behind.  With the aggressiveness that this will cause for the team that is ahead, my concern is that this will just create more lane bullying as opposed to people actually thinking \"hey, I can rotate to a different lane because my minions are stronger and will keep this lane pushed for now\".  Instead, I see this will just put the enemy laner in the position to continue to push minions under turret denying huge amounts of farm.  I realize this is not going to be a problem for higher elos who know how to farm well under turret, but from what I've seen in bronze and silver, this will be a nightmare of a change that will just end games much more quickly.  Stop weeding out the lower elos :P\n\nFrom all the changes that have been made, it seems like this is Riot's goal for next season:  making games shorter.  Sure, playing more games in a certain time frame can be fun, but a lot of people get way more enjoyment out of the games that are intense and go on for more than 40 minutes.  That is where the thrill is at.  Not seeing how quickly I can get to play another game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Silverclaw","date":"2015-11-21T03:22:11.023+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"The one thing that goes totally left out here is what I want to know. What about all the minion tactics players have come to learn over the years? How will that change, and will it even be feasible? Saying to your team _\"Don't push that tower, I want to keep my freeze\"_ in soloq will rarely work, if ever.  Splitpushing when your team is behind, one of many ways to come back into a game, looks to be MUCH harder in 5.23.\n\nI know the main argument that was tossed around earlier was \"the PBE didn't complain about it at all\" but that's because we had _no idea_ it was even happening, so I don't find this argument to be particularly valid. It's hard (if nigh impossible) to be able to give feedback to something as vague as minion damage unless you're really studying.\n\nAlso, it doesn't seem like the changes are not fully ready yet. If something of this magnitude goes ut WITHOUT a proper way to tell which team has the minions advantage at a glance and by how much, how do you expect anyone to be able to make proper use of it? Why are we making it hard to see?\n\nI'm not worried terribly about close matches. If the true level difference is about .2 to .4, then that's not bad (although that leaves out turret differential which is VERY IMPORTANT). I'm worried about the stomps just feeling stompier. And the stomps already feel plenty stompy.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bashi","date":"2015-11-21T09:08:42.816+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"As long as I don't die or miss kills or CS because of minion blocking (happens literally every game and it's the most frustrating thing) and the minions don't follow me half through river (giving the enemy team undeserved vision).

That means ennemy creeps will hit 20% harder than the ally creeps on the other side lane only from 1 action on the opposite side of the map? And if the jungler stay there and kill the lane again, what happens A LOT at high elo,  the game is basically over cause both mid and bot will be harpushed what means the ennemy team will get the objective control, also they will take the other T1 faster from the passive minion push, what will make the minion buff even harder, etc.. \n\nHow can you even think that could be a good thing...  that's basically the worst idea RIOT ever had in the history of the game.

So two champs being 1 level higher than their counterparts on the enemy team is only .4 levels up.  And if levels are even there will be no difference in minions based on downed towers.","replies":[]}]}]}
