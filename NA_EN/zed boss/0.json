Doesn't it occur to you guys that maybe they just dont care anymore? Not saying you shouldn't be complaining, but it hit me hard, that they just may not be listening anymore. At all I mean. What's the point now? It seems like Riot isnt even acknowledging your existence at this point. \r\n\r\nThis upsets me, because I even thought of coming back many times, but holy shit..it sounds like the state of the game has gotten worse and the fact that Riot STILL isnt communicating with its playerbase, is incredibly disheartening.","replies":[]}
