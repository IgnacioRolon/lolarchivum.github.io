This black screen at the loading screen you see is likely caused by a connection problem.  Your network might specifically be having trouble reaching our game server, regardless if your internet is fine elsewhere.  You'll want to go over each step of the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to fix that up.  Test it out in a custom as well so you don't get any penalties or LP loss.  Let me know if you have any questions!","replies":[]}]}
