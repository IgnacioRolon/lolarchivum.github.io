I&#039;m honor level 5 but I don&#039;t believe that has any bearing on the types of players I&#039;m grouped with.\r\n\r\nGranted this is low Elo (Silver II/III) but I don&#039;t understand how, when a player states in team chat, he/she is going to intentionally throw a game, despite his team mates begging him to rejoin/not throw, the account is not simply deleted?  I can not comprehend a situation where it is okay, regardless of how good or bad a team is, that a player states they are quitting and it&#039;s ok?  Riot, please, if somebody is reported, and your all-seeing-eye can see, that in game, that player, specifically tells his team he is quitting despite their attempts to win, it&#039;s is negligent on your part not to permanently BAN that account! \r\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}} \r\n\r\nIf somebody is so fed up they just DC/AFK, well understandably there&#039;s no real proof it&#039;s a rage/quit, and currently DC/AFK  does hurt, I&#039;ve been penalized courtesy of a bad PC/connection and wouldn&#039;t call it an unfair penalty.  You&#039;ve gotten better at banning accounts for inappropriate names, now please turn your attention to these players that are so commonly what NA LoL is so known for.  Over the years none of my gaming friends are willing to play LoL specifically because the community has such a bad reputation.  A few bad apples ruins the bunch.\r\n\r\nI would suggest stricter monitoring and much higher number of games played and even a number of days to pass, before being able to play ranked as it&#039;s the only way to slow down toxic players from making new accounts so quickly  Admittedly things are better than they were when I started lightly playing 6ish years ago, but there is still a lot of room for improvement.  \r\n\r\nLast though, please make some kind of higher access account requiring a credit card, long time delay before account is approved or something that long term players would benefit from.  I would happily pay a monthly subscription fee if it even cut down by half the number of over the top toxic players I had to play with.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPS.....Make Auto-fill optional..........{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"breakordoom444","date":"2018-11-10T04:12:20.592+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If we made auto-fill optional, ranked would take years.\n\nand with the current ah \"meta\", they need solid gameplay evidence or chat logs to prove that they are inting.\notherwise, bad players and meta exploiters (**_inting sion_**) will be punished even though they are trying their best.","replies":[{"poster":"Malachipt","date":"2018-11-11T09:07:51.218+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=breakordoom444,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=sxyVBYsv,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-11-10T04:12:20.592+0000)\n>\n> If we made auto-fill optional, ranked would take years.\n> \n> and with the current ah &quot;meta&quot;, they need solid gameplay evidence or chat logs to prove that they are inting.\n> otherwise, bad players and meta exploiters (**_inting sion_**) will be punished even though they are trying their best.\n\nThat was what I referenced specifically, when a player states in chat they are inting/quitting and then proceed to do that, it should be a guarantee account ban, or at very least ranked ban for the season.\n\nI would think if you opted out of auto-fill and as such you were stuck waiting for a while then so be it.  But other people who check the auto-fill box would certainly get to play sooner.  Most of my games (granted it's silver) only have 1 minute long Que times.  Auto-fill does not appear to happen very often at my elo, but when it does, it is often miserable for all.  I for one jungle or if need to, Support all time so if I get stuck as a laner my CS is terrible and everybody loses.  Same happens to others, don't want somebody stuck jungling who rarely if ever does it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"VanDeadly","date":"2018-11-10T04:25:24.027+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is almost a carbon copy of what I posted an hour ago. Tonight I decided to quit playing for the season because of trolls. In my last game we had an afk in the first 5 mins. Then we had a jg tell us in chat he was going to afk, int, sit in base, let the other team win, etc. If someone admits that, how are they not banned? Check out my post if you can, we need more exposure on this.","replies":[]}]}
