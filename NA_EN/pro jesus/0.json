We found no evidence of the most crucial games being played.\r\nI'm sorry to inform you that your tournament is ineligible for prize. We are unable to support it.\"\r\nSo this got me angry and till now i still cant udnerstand how riot meant that. So our enemies refused to play and riot is gonna punish everybody ? Really ?\r\nIm not writing this to get rewards or some stuff just wanna let the comunity and admins know that im not satisfied with riots decisions lately not only with this one.\r\nPS: I hope I found the right sub-section this time, im dont really come to the forum often {{champion:24}}","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-02T05:59:32.495+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm sorry to hear you aren't satisfied with your tournament's outcome.
