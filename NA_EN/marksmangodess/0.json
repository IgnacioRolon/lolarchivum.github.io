I recently bought 50 per win boost and 3 per day boost, but it doesnt seem to stack up? I only recieve 1 boost ?? can i get help?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-08T02:28:21.489+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The boosts will not actually overlap with each other I don't believe. AFAIK the daily boost would take effect first since it will guarantee you get more IP, then once that one was used up the 50 win boost would kick in. \n\nWith that being said, it looks like those boosts weren't actually added correctly to your account. Something a little weird is going on at the moment, and I wasn't able to get both boosts on your account at the same time from my end, but I did go ahead and refund the 50win boost and made sure the 3 day boost was on there, that way you had one of the boosts you bought and had the one that wouldn't work refunded (due to the store error).\n\nIf you try buying that 50 win boost again and it still doesn't work, please hit us up in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) so that we can start looking into this issue more closely!","replies":[]}]}
