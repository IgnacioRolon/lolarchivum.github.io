But didn't notice he left the store. When did you's take him out? And could you possibly answer me i am confused. Been away on vacation for a week.

This shop was only around for a short period during the preseason after converting IP to BE.  The BE shop will return, though, I cannot make any guarantees for what content would be made available.  It's too late to grab Urfwick now, but keep your eyes on our [News](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/) page should something come up.  Sorry!","replies":[]}]}
