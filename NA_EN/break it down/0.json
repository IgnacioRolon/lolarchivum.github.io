What makes Ninja Tabi powerful is the fact that every champion uses auto attacks and it blocks a percentage of damage instead of a static number, which means it scales even if you fall behind. \n\nThe AD enemy gets a lead, you get Tabi and now they're instantly useless because it gives Armor and has a busted passive that blocks a huge percentage of auto attack damage. Simply put, auto attack negation shouldn't be a mechanic that is allowed in League of Legends. Riot already removed it from Doran's Shield for the same reason, I'm not sure why they allow it to exist on boots.","replies":[{"poster":"Break It Down","date":"2018-03-12T01:40:16.406+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tabi and Merc treads negate the penetration/lethality , which costs a ton to get with just 1100 gold, they're overpowered its a fact","replies":[{"poster":"Best Ekko NA","date":"2018-03-12T06:37:42.260+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Break It Down,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=PTPRAtgm,comment-id=00000000000000000000,timestamp=2018-03-12T01:40:16.406+0000)\n>\n> Tabi and Merc treads negate the penetration/lethality , which costs a ton to get with just 1100 gold, they&#x27;re overpowered its a fact\n\nYou can get a Chain Armor and Negatron Cloak for cheaper than those boots.

If you don't like that, play a different champion.\n\nAlright, now to sound less snarky about it.\n\nBoots give basic stats because boots are something that, inevitably, everyone's going to buy. You can't do crazy-ass shit with boots like giving them actives or crazy passive abilities that work under certain conditions. They are meant to be passive and soft-counter items, not core parts of a build.\n\nAlso, why did you put Rapid Fire Cannon and Shiv in the same example? They're basically the same item.\n\nLethality boots is an awful idea because of how damage works. Magic pen on boots is fine because there are very limited sources of magic pen in the game, and mages get totally screwed by MR, much more than assassins get screwed by armor. Plus, the reason you're suggesting lethality is because armor pen doesn't exist anymore. Armor pen doesn't exist because it was too fucking strong on AD champions, and had to be completely reworked into something else. Not to mention, you could by 5 fully completed items, all with a metric shit-ton of lethality. We don't need it on boots too.\n\nFurthermore, of course these boots have some pretty high stats. The reason for that is because, in order to get boots, you have to sacrifice an item slot. Besides, since attack speed is capped, buying those boots just pushes you towards the cap a bit. I honestly don't know why it makes that much of a difference to you. Not to mention that ADC's are one of the roles that probably have the least control of the outcome of a game right now, and this would only make them even worse. They take so long to get started, by the time they start making a difference, the game is already basically over.\n\nAnd, as a side-note, why didn't you say anything about Boots of Mobility? Also, what do you think about getting rid of boot enchantments?","replies":[]},{"poster":"C9 Squeeky ","date":"2018-03-12T01:09:22.735+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"NO on lethality boots. There's a reason why flat armor pen got removed. You'd have to nerf assassins (who already are weak in meta) and bruisers (again, not favored compared to tanks). AD outshines AP in a 1:1 ratio with AA & AA resets. CD between autos is much shorter than CD for abilities.\n\nI don't think you need to increase the cost of t1 boots to 350. MS isn't direct combat stats, even if it has its own uses like dodging skillshots and stutter-stepping. You shouldn't be punished by spending 50g that doesn't help you to trade/farm safely.\n\nTabi/Merc idea I like, though I'd probably add a small cripple FX (reduced atk speed) to tabi instead of reducing more dmg. It shouldn't punish crit builds, which are for tank-busting.\n\nYou don't need AD/AP on boots. That is what your other 5 slots are for. Selling your boots for a 6th item should also be a choice.","replies":[{"poster":"Break It Down","date":"2018-03-12T01:39:30.417+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tabi and mercs are what's the problem they're negating the Penetration items for both ad and ap , and they cost just 1100 gold!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"RainbowCrash88","date":"2018-03-12T01:38:14.785+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I disagree.","replies":[]}]}
