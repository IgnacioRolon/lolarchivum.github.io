Anyways, how did I determine this, you ask? Well, if you look on wikipedia at the top 5 most expensive movies ever made, you'll notice that all of them cost AT LEAST $300 million to make. On the other hand, if you look at the top 5 most expensive games ever made on wikipedia, not a single one if them cost more than $300 million. And let me also point out that (conveniently) the movie article doesn't take inflation into account, while the video game one does. Even when inflation is taken into account, movies STILL cost more. With this in mind, games theoretically should cost less, but we all know this isn't the case. If you don't believe me, let me ask you this. When was the last time you spent $60 or more on a movie? I can't think of a single time I ever have. And did you ever have to spend $400+ on a dvd or blueray player? I think not. And did you ever have to spend money for additional content (whether it's cosmetic or not) in a movie? No. When you buy a movie, you get EVERYTHING. The only reason games cost more is greed. Prove me wrong.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most_expensive_video_games_to_develop\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most_expensive_films","replies":[]}
