Dying is going to happen a lot.\n2.  Don't be afraid to take risks.\n3.  Don't run around with your shield up.  Just use it for perfect blocks.\n4.  If there's something that has your attention, you are probably going to be attacked from the side, rear, or above.  \n5.  Some chests will kill you if you don't attack them first.\n6.  Save your item upgrades for the important items to you.\n7.  A lot of people suggest starting a knight on the first playthrough for the extra armor.\n8.  Falling kills enemies and bosses too.\n9.  The stats you level depends on the items you use and if you cast spells or not.\n10.  The lore is in the world and the item descriptions.\n11.  Holy items help against undead.\n12.  Don't be like dan and run around in the darkest area in the game, complaining about a lack of light, when you have a lantern in your inventory.\n13.  If something is too hard, you are probably doing something wrong.  \n14.  A lot of challenges and obstacles can be beaten several ways.\n\nThere's a spoiler I can give if you want it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shandrake","date":"2017-10-03T01:51:55.434+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is only one tip you truly need to follow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_Praise the Sun_","replies":[]},{"poster":"SymbolicFear","date":"2017-10-03T01:38:16.828+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay bud, as someone who has been a huge dark souls fan boy, since Demon Souls, its first installment.

Pyromancy scales entirely with an upgraded item called a Pyromancer's flame. Sorcery has a diverse amount of spells. Pyromancy is almost entirely fire damage.\n\nStats for a sorcerer are mostly going to be intelligence for scaling, attunement which allows you to equip more spells, and vitality which increase your health.\n\nStrength and Dexterity will play their part when you pick your weapon, and you will need a weapon. Endurance increases your stamina and how much your equipment can weigh so it has its uses but as a sorcerer your armor is typically going to be very light.\n\nFaith lets you use miracles which you wont want as a sorcerer. Resistance is literally a useless stat.\n\nFor stats you want to start off by going for the soft caps.\n\nVitality is 30. Intelligence is 40. Attunement is 50. Soft caps are where more points invested will result in you getting less of that stat for each point.","replies":[]}]}
