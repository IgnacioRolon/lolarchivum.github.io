You could in theory have something like where it does damage on first attack and marks the opponent, and the second cast within 4 seconds has the knock back effect. \n\nI don't mind how it's currently set up, but if you were looking at options to change it, it wouldn't be that hard. You don't have to just add to, you can reduce from the initial to balance it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Cloud273","date":"2017-02-02T20:43:53.859+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This isn't about \"adding more\".

You could easily re-tune it to do % damage initially and % damage +knock back on second cast.\n\nThis would actually lower his power I think as he would actually have his damage and effect spread out over time allowing for a little more counter play.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Requiemsfire","date":"2017-02-01T20:42:56.272+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wouldn't that be redundant?","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-02-01T20:43:18.403+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"GR8 B8 M8","replies":[]}]}
