What I'm wondering is how you balance this game when you get different feedback from different regions. This is completely hypothetical, but let's say NA thinks Irelia is OP, but EU West/East thinks she is weak. You also have Riot staff from each region (or who visit different forum regions). If different regions have different opinions on how to balance champions, how do you decide what to do?","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2014-11-06T04:12:33.535+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Short version - we don't balance off volume of feedback. What's useful is the logic and justification behind the feedback - one well put argument for why something's too strong, weak, abusive etc's worth more than hundreds of 'wtf nerf' comments. Sometimes that will mean a champ is considered overpowered in some regions and underpowered in others (Ezreal a couple of years ago in China, compared to most of the rest of the world, being one of the clearest examples). We won't always get that assessment right the first time of course, and there have certainly been cases where we've missed something or acted incorrectly based off a pattern in some region's, that's the approach we seek to follow though.","replies":[{"poster":"CupcakeTrap","date":"2014-11-06T06:20:58.088+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [Chinese Ezreal]\n\nTime to link **[this](http://www.nerfplz.com/2011/12/theoddones-compiled-ezreal-quotes.html)** again.\n\n \"TeddyRO's trying to prove something by playing Ezreal.

All his Qs get blocked by ghouls and TANKS, he's not even viable. What are you going to do, shoot these zombies to death?\"\n\n \"So we have Ezreal poking them down. And by poking I mean 10 damage.\"\n\n \"I'm getting will of the ancients to help out Ezreal. Now he'll do 20 damage instead of 10 damage\"\n\n \"Could have picked a real champ like Corki but noooo picked Ezreal.\" \n\n \"Great. Ezreal just died to Malaria. The jungler didn't even come gank. Ezreal just died to disease walking in grass. Ezreal's so weak that he dies to things that doesn't even exist in this game.\"\n\n \"See that's why they didn't release the Pulsefire Ezreal, they were afraid people would actually play him and realize how bad he is...then never play him again\"\n\n \"Ezreal's damage is so low it doesn't even register as an assist. It only registers when he dies\"\n\n \"Ezreal does so little damage he's like a ****ing minion.

Also all other types of feedback on content from other regions are ignored.[...]\n\nYeah, while I can't confirm this from playing on NA, I do remember the situation for non-NA players, when the \"community discussion\" was launched for the Karma rework.\n\nSuch a discussion was never started by Rioters in other regions and I even tried to create an NA acccount to give feedback on what I would've liked to keep on Karma or what made her strong for me. Of course, I couldn't take part in the discussion, since my NA account was below lvl5 at that time.\n\nI felt quite helpless, because I kinda had to stand back and watch the whole rework take place. Consequently, I was even more disappointed with it, since my own opinion as a Karma player, who actually mained her as a support in particular until the rework, got ignored.\n\n\n\n * **That said I at least want to thank you, Riot, for creating these cross-regional forums! ** Finally, players from all regions can contribute to a topic that will eventually affect them all.","replies":[]}]}]}
