If you send someone there, then your siege is over, and their team had an advantage because the time it takes for one of you to get back to top lane is enough time for trynda to take a turret.\n\nTanks don't really screw him, unless the tank is fed and trynda isn't, in which case he just runs away with his E and Ult if needed.

Yi actually takes skill to play at a high lvl, trynda is very braindead, only requires some game knowledge and match up experience at most to do well with (unless you jungle, in which more emphasis in knowledge, less in match ups). The difference between a skilled Yi (like cowsep) and those \"hurr engage with alpha strike and right click\" yi is absurdly higher than that of a tryndamere main and someone who just randomly decides to pick trynda.\n\nAnd no, tanks don't generally screw him. Some bruisers can work against him, but then again if he randomly crits twice in a roll at lvl 2 it's kinda gg regardless so there's that, but anyways, in a match up where trynda can't outright kill you, he just farms and farms with his free sustain, and if needed (ganked?) just rolls and imortalities away. He'll eventually outscale almost anything. Try and pick a tank, let's say a Rammus, who's verily known as anti-ad, against a tryndamere and rush a thornmail. Proceed to watch him ignore you and kill your wave, while you can't kill minions for shit and just lose a ton of CS and get behind and then die to him when he decides to jump at you with a few items ahead.\n\nA malphite could work I guess, i don't have experience in that match up but I guess with the attack speed slow and the kiting with Q he could do allright, but then again, trynda will just ignore him and split push, malph can't really stop trynda from pushing and eventually goes oom while trynda perma-sustains","replies":[{"poster":"Ariel the Cruel","date":"2015-06-28T15:26:21.753+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"> but then again if he randomly crits twice in a roll at lvl 2 it's kinda gg regardless so there's that\n\nThat's the only problem I have with Trynd.\nHell, I can take {{champion:201}} top and make his life miserable.

The team that has an underfed or farmed {{champion:23}} has a huge weight to carry. He either gets a little fed, then roams to other lanes crushing them, or he loses lane very badly and loses for the rest of the game. It's why so many rage quit if they don't get fed.\n\nHis kit is so annoying, but easy to overcome. It's designed to overwhelm a lot of players, but when you figure out how to build/outplay him, he just becomes an annoyance until you start dominating the lane. After that it's a cake walk. \n\nI play {{champion:114}} against him quite a bit, and I have no CC, and I'm not terribly tanky. When I'm up against him though I rush {{item:3047}} and {{item:3075}} . I also get {{item:3140}} and build it into {{item:3139}} . {{summoner:14}} this spell is essential for your match up because of his ult. However the best time to shut him down is always pre 6, so pick a champion with a decent early game, or ask for a gank. Trade with him frequently, and this should be easy because his bar requires him to push the lane.\n\nAlthough he's not difficult to outplay, and doesn't require a lot of skill to beat for most champions, I do think he's toxic for this game. He sucks all the fun out of playing top lane, and I see him so much in my unranked normal games because people in bronze/silver fall victim to his ridiculous kit. \n\nThe most problematic part of him is that if he gets fed off of others, then you're in for a miserable game where you basically have to avoid him unless you have the full team. I wish they would rework him already.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ironclad Dragon","date":"2015-06-30T06:36:24.720+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tryndamere players, I'm sorry. But screw Tryndamere's ultimate. Why should he be able to activate his ultimate why he's stunned? Why the Phreak can he subvert what should be a bedrock that you can always rely upon?\n\nWhen someone becomes stunned, they can't do anything. They cannot escape or retaliate or even act. That's the whole point of a video game stun. If you're stunned, you're locked out. And for the most part, that's how it works in League. Except if you're Tryndamere –he can still activate his ultimate, which will outlast whatever stun you put on him. Then he will turn around and kill you.\n\nPutting aside how aggravating that can be, that flat-out violates an otherwise-universal rule of the game. If you play any other champion and get stunned, you can't use your abilities. Even Tryndamere himself can't use his other abilities when his stunned. So why is his ultimate, of the hundreds of abilities that exist in the game, is the sole exception to this rule?\n\nI will permit that a lot of recent champions have bent our perceptions of what's allowable in game, e.g., taking away control from your allies (Bard, Tahm Kench to a lesser extent), being able to attack and move at the same time (Kalista), bypassing terrain (Bard), giving allies the ability to stun (Braum), etc. But what if Riot made a champion who, if he runs out of mana, can still use his abilities? He's not resourceless; he can just keep using his abilities without a hitch if he doesn't have mana. Which means, yes, he can still benefit from Manamune and Archangel's Staff. That'd violate a fundamental rule of the game. Even \"unfair\" Ekko can't use his abilities when he's out of mana.\n\nSo why does Tryndamere get to subvert how the system works? \"Oh, but Dragon, if Tryndamere can't get off his ult when he's stunlocked, he'll be useless!\" I call crap! If Karthus doesn't get off his ult, he won't be at his best. If Gnar doesn't get off his ult, he won't be at his best. If Lulu, if Nasus, if almost every champ in the game can't get off their ultimate, they won't be at their full potential. That's why you stunlock them! You render them null and void! \"Well, but, it's part of his core identity!\" So is everyone else's ult. If Tryndamere really needs his ult that badly just to preform, that's a sign that something's wrong with his kit.","replies":[{"poster":"Rueian","date":"2015-06-30T19:15:27.925+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"would you rather his ultimate also be like olaf, who can BREAK CC?\nBe glad it only activates.","replies":[{"poster":"Ironclad Dragon","date":"2015-06-30T19:18:05.451+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Rueian,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=bnrPMTmy,comment-id=00480000,timestamp=2015-06-30T19:15:27.925+0000)\n>\n> would you rather his ultimate also be like olaf, who can BREAK CC?\n\nUh, no?
