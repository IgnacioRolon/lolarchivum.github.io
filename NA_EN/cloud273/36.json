Lucian is currently sitting at a 44% play rate, and he still maintains a 53% win rate. We also have Ezreal, another popular champion, and he&#039;s only at a 47% win rate. Not played as much as Lucian, but still very high play rate. Ahri is played more than any other mid laner in this game, and she has a higher win rate than 99% of them. I could keep listing examples, but you get the point. So, when we talk about balance, please don&#039;t bring up play rates.

Winrates don't go down because a bunch of noobs are playing the champ. They go down because the champion is weak and harder to play. Ahri has a high play rate and high win rate because she's easy to play, and she does literally EVERYTHING. She has sustain in lane, true damage, safety with her dashes, and hard cc. And she does a ton of damage.\n\nNow let's look at another champion with a high play rate, Ezreal. He has a blink (which isn't even that good honestly), but everything else about him sucks. His mana costs are too high, his cooldowns are way too long, he has the worst waveclear of any adc, and he's way too squishy. He also has the most counterplay of all adc's because his kit is mostly skillshot based. But people claim he's OP because \"on hit effects\". He actually needs to farm before he gets the item, and as I said his waveclear is terrible, so good luck with that.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-04-09T19:54:04.485+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Go play ahri for some freelo, then.

More random nonsense. Such quality posts from you. OP.gg confirms she is indeed a noob champ, since even in bronze she has a 51% win rate (which is actually impressive considering the population of bronze).","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-04-09T22:10:15.229+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Wonderful cherry-picking and hypocrisy.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"CannabisOverlord","date":"2017-04-08T19:42:24.916+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Point in case, Mordekaiser has a 58% winrate and a .77% pick rate xD","replies":[{"poster":"La Belle Sauvage","date":"2017-04-08T21:46:28.317+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've always reject op arguments on champs if  there win rate is way above 50% but pick ate is under 5%. \n\nMany people utter, \"Take  Zigs bot!

That statistic  means  little to me. \n\nI'd take notice at X champ with a  win rate at a 55% or higher and their pick rate is above what the average pick rates are for the top champ in each class. Like say nunu adc  is winning 69% of games with a pick rate of 60% (Absurdity on purpose).
