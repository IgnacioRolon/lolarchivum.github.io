Not only are they gapclosers but also escapes so beating her in lane is.... near impossible she can jump in take out your health and get right back out probably never taking the same damage that she dealt and usually none. \n3. Not only does she have her huge gapclosers she can return to for an escape but her passive is a clone AND invisibility making her this perfect assassin with everything in her kit that it would take 4 other assassins put together to make.\n4. Lets compare kassadin - had insane mobility and reasonable damage now he has pretty much neither and i guess riot wished to make him useless, they were successful. \nKhaz - once a feared damage doing mobile jungler. Now a pathetic wimp that can barely clear his camps let alone try to make a gank because he his backing after every 2 camps now. On top of that it was supposedly a good idea to nerf him multiple times in a row so they take a champions from strong to average to worthless. It seems that riot likes to make champions worthless once they become popular. For example khaz was strong but never insanely op and look at vi now pretty much dominates every game and untouched.\nON terms of khazix he was one of my favorite champions to play and definitely needs to be shown some love and if they don't want to rebuff his w, then why not give his q a buff so he can at least do SOMETHING.\nRengar - decent assasin, has a stealth , very high damage, no escape, and a gap closer that takes skill to use. Compared to leblanc he is nothing she has everything he doesn't and requires no skill to use them.\nZed - Still strong if skillshots are hit but worthless for auto attacks now. Has an escape, gap closer, and high damage. Still nothing compared to leblanc considering all of his damage relies on landing his q's.\n\nAll in all leblanc is just an absurd champion and some other weak champions like khaz need to be shown some love.","replies":[]},{"poster":"flibitydoo","date":"2015-03-06T17:18:44.984+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"kassadin gets really tanky from his general item build though\n\nleblanc doesn't\n\nlategame, \nIf you cc Leblanc when she goes in, then you can usually burst her down and kill her\n\nif you cc kass when he goes in, then you can knock out about 50% of his max hp before he blinks away.","replies":[{"poster":"JedenVojak","date":"2015-03-06T20:50:41.570+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=flibitydoo,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=hVJ9EIxZ,comment-id=000d,timestamp=2015-03-06T17:18:44.984+0000)\n>\n> kassadin gets really tanky from his general item build though\n> \n> leblanc doesn't\n> \n> lategame, \n> If you cc Leblanc when she goes in, then you can usually burst her down and kill her\n> \n> if you cc kass when he goes in, then you can knock out about 50% of his max hp before he blinks away.\n\nIt's not that Kassadin get's really tanky from his item build, it's that he has no choice but to build tanky (RoA + Zhonya's = tanky???) because A) The meaningful mana items (and you MUST build mana as kassadin) provide some form of tankiness or shield and B)he doesn't do anywhere near enough damage to kill his opponent, meaning that he will be counterbursted/attacked by his target, meaning he has to be able to survive the encounter long enough to get back out.\n\nI would love to be able to make a glass cannon-instaburst Kassadin - he just can't do it right now.

Leblanc was probably one of the first 5 or 10 champions I played.\nAt the time, about 1.5 years ago, no one ever played Leblanc, and it was nice to play a less picked champion.\nShe even had a silence back then...i remember picking her one game , doing well...and someone was like \"Leblanc is good?\"\nLiterally all they've changed since then is removing her silence. \n\nNow she sees LCS pick and is spammed in solo queue. I can barely play my favorite champion now bc every just bitches and bitches\nabout her being OP. \n\nAnyways, I've played her a lot (i'm only mid gold, but i don't play ranked much), but here are some tips for you whiners playing against her:\n\n1) shove her into her turret early, before she gets 3+ points in W. To hit her mid game power spike, it is important to quickly get her first 2  items (some CDR and AP). Yet, her early farming and AA is quite poor, exploit this. Force her to use her W to farm and waste her mana. Delay or weaken her mid-game (when she is arguably at her strongest) by hurting her early farm. This opportunity really only exists through levels 1-4 or so, so don't miss it.\n\n2) Following 1): do not let her push. If you don't want to push to make yourself vulnerable, then fine, but don't let her push...if she does then she has the ability to become a huge lane bully and turret dive with little retaliation potential on her enemy's part. If you keep the waves balanced, or better - yours pushed, she won't really be able to push without using W, which is costly early and leaves her vulnerable without her escape. \n\n3) Remember, Leblanc is one of the strongest if not THE strongest lvl 6 champion. Respect the lvl 6. I stress this much more if she has flash + ignite available. \n\n4) She is a burst mage or assassin. She quickly uses all her abilities and then is all but useless while waiting for cool downs. Play carefully until she uses her combo. Wait for it, attempt to juke her E, and immediately engage her / the team after her combo is down.\n\n5) she has huge kill potential and engage-range while Flash + ignite is available. Keep your distance. Force her to waste W as a gap closer, and prepare to juke E. \n\n6) Landing E makes for a skilled Leblanc-everthing is about landing that E. You know when it's coming...obviously when she Q's you or dashes in your face. Remember, keep your distance and prepare to juke the E. \n\n7) Ping her MIA & follow her roams. \n\nI know some of this is obvious, but I hope it helps someone.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kakakakakaka","date":"2015-03-07T14:07:24.311+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"remove the passive and gg easy","replies":[]},{"poster":"Demented Lemur","date":"2015-03-07T05:16:26.806+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"OK just going to say lebancs W is not a skill shot it's a dash as it cannot be blocked by Yasuo's wind wall and cannot be minion blocked unlike a true skill shot","replies":[]},{"poster":"Realm Down","date":"2015-03-06T19:29:42.534+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't really understand what's so scary about Leblanc.. she's mobile, sure, but she's also super, super squishy and if she doesn't land her skillshots she's generally useless.
