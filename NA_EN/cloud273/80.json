I guess mages aren&#039;t allowed to have CC, AOE damage, or something that makes them unique. I don&#039;t care if gragas wasn&#039;t meant to be played as an AP champ. That&#039;s how he was being played, and he was average at best. Other mages like Annie, Malzahar, Swain, etc are equally strong but they haven&#039;t been nerfed into oblivion yet. I feel like every time a mage becomes good, Riot nerfs them. Lulu and Kayle started being played mid, and because they countered the assassins, we have to get rid of them. I feel like the assassins are the only champions Riot cares about anymore, and anything that beats them gets nerfed into an unplayable state (Kassadin is actually decent still).","replies":[{"poster":"67chrome","date":"2015-03-28T03:11:33.848+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"The problem with most of the champions you mentioned getting nerffed comes down to counter-play, or a lack there of.\n\nCounter-play is the basic idea that everything shouldn't just be fun to use, but should also be fun to have used against you in some way.\nThe some way Riot has opted for is choice.

Since his free mana regen is now gone, why can't he have his AP ratios back? \n\nAlso, Nidalee does the exact same thing as Gragas. She pokes even harder and it's very difficult to poke her down since she'll just heal any damage done to her and she has free mobility.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Talamare","date":"2015-03-28T02:43:53.341+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I believe Gragas needs to be carefully balanced to be a close range AP mage\n\nRolling barrels from 1500 range was stupid gameplay, and if you ever got close he would E or R you away.\n\nGragas should be balanced in a way that makes him want to use E and R to get closer and be more in your face.

His barrels would destroy minion waves with little effort, and his old W gave him damage reduction for like 20 seconds (though the CD was around 25), so he'd be very hard to harass. \n\nHis ult's big thing was and still is the displacement effect, so you can position it to really fuck up enemy's positioning. His old ult was so strong damage-wise that AP Grags just used it as a finisher more than anything. \n\n\nHe had to get reworked because his ratios caused him to be played in an unhealthy way (and this is coming from someone who likes playing the new Gragas and prefers it over the original), and went against the design goals Riot had for him.","replies":[]}]}
