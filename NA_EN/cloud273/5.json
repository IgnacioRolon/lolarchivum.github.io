Edit: Looks like the Q stun got changed to 1.25s instead of the 1.0s it had always been too (tooltip was wrong). That's just outright bugged (not intended in 6.14 either) and will also add noticeable power. \n* More good targets bot lane for her. Leona does well against squishy enchanter type supports and we've seen some increases in play rate for some of those in 6.13. \n\nWe've still got changes coming in 6.14 for her. Original intent of those changes was power neutral, given some of the buffs shipped without any of the nerfs would expect 6.14 to make her weaker than in 6.13.

Now look at a lane with thresh vs leona.  Both are tanky, have great CC, and arguably thresh will provide more teamplay benefits with lantern.  Problem isn't with 1 champ but the entire champ catagory.  Its why so many people are playing midlaners and top laners in the bot lane as support now.
