I was jungling, and I  let Soraka and Kayle hold the lanes. It wasn&#039;t for the entire game, but for a significant portion of the game, Soraka bot just sat at our tower doing absolutely nothing. Sometimes after she got killed, she would go somewhere else and do the same thing. Also, there were small periods of time where she followed us around and helped us teamfight, but for the most part she just sat there. I wish I had a video of this, but unfortunately I do not. Will be happy to answer any questions.","replies":[{"poster":"Princess Emma","date":"2016-09-06T00:05:01.213+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think it is an issue with the Twisted Treeline.\nSoraka Bot works on Summoner's Rift, but I never tried her on TT.\n\nJinx and Fizz bot don't work on the Twisted Treeline either, but I think they might be able to work on Summoner's Rift.
