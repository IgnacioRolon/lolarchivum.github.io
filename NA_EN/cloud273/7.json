Anyways, let me start by saying I think this is an amazing game. The first 3d mario game ever made, it was pretty incredible when it came out, even though the graphics weren't the best. But there's one thing about this game that's a bit strange. This game has no super mushrooms or fire flowers, things that have been in every other Mario game in existence. I realize this game has other power ups, but it still seems weird they were left out of a Mario game. Why do you think they chose to exclude them?","replies":[]}
