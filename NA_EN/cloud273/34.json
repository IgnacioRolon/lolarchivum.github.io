I'm gonna be paraphrasing it down hard as i vaguely remember the details but i remember the point of it. \n\nThe guy was playing an online game like chess or something and the opponent won and he wanted to give some reply to show he wasn't a poor sport right. So he thinks to himself ill reply with \"good for you\" but ill shorten it to \"gfy\" and be mr l33t. The opponent get offended of course and the guy doesnt understand why till he explains what he thinks gfy stands for. \n\nYa i know i told it bad and you probably figured it out at gfy or good for you but the point is this story i remember from like 2002 maybe? and i didn't even know that acronym at the time. Some people don't and some do and it's not something that should be auto dealt with but maybe case by case and in the context of the conversation and game. but that is just my two cents.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"KlydeFrog","date":"2017-09-25T05:07:42.381+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"exactly","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Rodder","date":"2017-09-23T22:01:26.571+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"They should autochange such phrases into something like  \"i am stupid and need to wash my mouth  with soap\".\n\nOne game actually did that, i just cant remember wich one.","replies":[{"poster":"A Sealed Box","date":"2017-09-26T03:20:21.141+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Rodder,realm=EUW,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=EhWE93EF,comment-id=0008,timestamp=2017-09-23T22:01:26.571+0000)\n>\n> They should autochange such phrases into something like  &quot;i am stupid and need to wash my mouth  with soap&quot;.\n> \n> One game actually did that, i just cant remember wich one.\n\nOverwatch did this.
