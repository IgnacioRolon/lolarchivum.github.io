And this isn&#039;t unique to one particular assassin. Literally EVERY assassin in this game has at least one of these things. And they don&#039;t even have to work for their kills. Literally all they do is right click you and win. Katarina, Akali, Shaco, Talon, Zed, etc. Almost all of the abilities they possess are just point and click burst. Nidalee is the one assassin in this game I have respect for. Because when she wants a kill she actually has to work for it. If she doesn&#039;t land that Javelin she isn&#039;t killing anyone. Other assassins are just...smack face on keyboard and win.","replies":[{"poster":"Paeon","date":"2016-12-19T07:33:14.173+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"All honesty, the assassin's have tons of counter play. Just pay attention to what they do and things will change. The reworks helped and unless these champs are ahead they are meh. Exhaust is a thing","replies":[]},{"poster":"I am Pacman","date":"2016-12-19T07:37:27.504+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"If fizz doesnt land that shark he isnt killing anyone, If rengar doesn't snowball hard early he isnt killing anyone, talon has no escape in teamfights, akali is still a broken champ and is kept permanerfed because of it, kat was completly reworked and is now waaay more obvious.  Leblanc has to wait to get her burst off.\n\nThey made assasins less faceroll with the assasin update during preseason. Just use exhaust on them when they dive your carry.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shaydrox","date":"2016-12-19T10:14:26.309+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The rework made them 10x less faceroll, even Rioters are saying most of them went from easier champions to more difficult champions. Looking at faceroll champions I'd point my finger at someone like Annie rather than someone like Kat lol","replies":[]}]}
