If you go on lol.gamepedia.com you&#039;ll notice almost half of their active roster is Korean players. Is this really a win for China when almost half of their team is from a different country? Just saying. I&#039;m not butthurt that Fanatic lost or anything (personally I don&#039;t really care who wins), and I'm happy for IG, but I don&#039;t really think it&#039;s fair to call Invictus Gaming a Chinese team when almost half of their players are Korean. As a comparison, look at Fanatic. Almost their entire team is European players, so it's completely fair to call them an EU team.","replies":[{"poster":"QuadraBananas","date":"2018-11-04T07:01:22.414+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"IG players are currently playing on korean server because they are in korea for the world tournament right now.

But I think in order for it to be a true victory for China you need a team of China born players. Look at SKT. Not a single player on their team is from a different country. Literally all of them are Korean. I'm sure they make their country EXTREMELY proud every year at worlds. They don't have to rely on talent from other countries.

And yea SKT didn't make it to Worlds THIS year, but I'm sure all the other years that they have makes up for that. The pride that Korea gets when SKT team wins is greater than the pride China gets this year. When they (SKT) win they do it without help from anyone.

The team's nationality is Chinese regardless of who goes into the team. \n\nThe same reason why say, Fnatic having had many Korean players in its roster at different part of its history (former and current; 1 currently active) does not in any way undermine the unquestionable fact that it's an European team; or how the 2 currently active EU players in C9 also does not in any way, shape, or form undermine C9 as a NA team.\n\nLeague (and most sport and game topic/event) is not something like Olympic Games or World Cup where BOTH the team and the player themselves represent the nation/region they are from, it does not require specific citizenship of the player to be recognised eligible to join and represent a team. In League, the victory is in the end of the day crowned to the team and not the nation/region; the tendency to associate teams with nationalities is ultimately unofficial and only exist mainly within the playerbase. This is the same for every single team sport and game event that is not specific and emphasising on the nationality part, which is basically 90%+ of it; import happens a lot  and this is no news, so to speak.\n\nEither way, the team is a Chinese team because it's registered as Chinese, and that's kinda it.
