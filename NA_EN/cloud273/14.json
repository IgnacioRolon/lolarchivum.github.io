Don't get me wrong, these players are good but they aren't that much better than Gold players. Diamond players just have a more consistent performance than Gold players. If you're looking for high elo games then Masters and up is where you want. The difference between a Diamond 4 player and a Master player is much much larger than the difference between a Diamond and a Gold player.\n\nIf you want to spectate Diamond games, you might as well just spectate the Gold players on your friend list. You're gonna see basically the same gameplay.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cloud273","date":"2019-10-24T09:53:33.908+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=FOR JUSTICE,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=kc8w0v4G,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2019-10-24T06:55:48.414+0000)\n>\n> from what i can see you can only spec people in masters+ in client.\n> if it existed as far as diamond thats kinda cool\n\nI might be mistaken about the diamond part. I just remember they were always high elo games. To be fair though master and grandmaster weren't around when this was a thing, so people in challenger often got paired with diamond players.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"FioraWillCarry","date":"2019-10-24T18:29:39.752+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> I know this has been gone for awhile\n\nA while?

I mean just use any site like LeagueOfGraphs or op.gg, find any high elo player you want, log in on an account on the same server as the player, look up their match history from the client and you can download the replay of any of the last 20 ranked games played on the current patch.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LatetotheRace","date":"2019-10-24T18:00:33.637+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're always to spec my games, but I doubt you'll learn anything, my games are a fiasco XD","replies":[]},{"poster":"Veloz Destello","date":"2019-10-24T09:19:12.629+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can now spectate every single game downloading the game in profiles lol","replies":[]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-10-24T07:18:02.670+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can still spectate high-level play, but you have to go to your profile, then look at ranked, then choose a ranked leaderboard, scroll through the list of names until you see one with an \"eye\" icon, and then right-click and choose \"spectate.\" You can't see how far along the match is, nor what champions people are playing.
