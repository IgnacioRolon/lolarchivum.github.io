This was technically my first game. A few years later I got a SNES for my birthday with Donkey Kong, and this is what really got me into gaming. I remember I couldn&#039;t get past the snow world for some reason, and then a few years later I started playing again and finally beat the game. So what was the first game you ever played, and which game got you addicted?","replies":[]}
