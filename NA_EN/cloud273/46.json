Lee Sin isn't nearly as hard as his fanboys pretend, but he's still a mechanically difficult champion compared to most. As such, his win rate would've been skewed negatively by quite a bit.

I don't think win rate is the be all end all, but it is a valid statistic and an important metric. I would like to see someone smarter than I do an analysis of win rates of champs who are being played by their mains. I would find that interesting.","replies":[{"poster":"Shinjusuke","date":"2015-04-15T18:15:29.444+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The problem is, you're like the guy who says \"Scientific Theories aren't true because they're still just theories\".

This is what League has repeatedly shown to be the trends. This is a logical sequence of thought. What you're asking for requires access to the information of every game ever played by every player in the history of the game, which nobody on these forums can provide and frankly is unnecessary to establish a balance state.  You're asking to see number specification for correlations that're plainly seen by anyone with any understanding of trends, which is fine I guess, but it seems like you're just debating for the sake of debating rather than accepting the obvious case in front of you.  That's the point when I say \"alright, just think what ya want\", because nothing more can be gained from the discussion at that point.","replies":[{"poster":"Mikal Pikal","date":"2015-04-15T21:16:15.625+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> The problem is, you're like the guy who says \"Scientific Theories aren't true because they're still just theories\". Anyone who isn't willingly ignorant knows Gravity exists. But it's still a theory.\n\nUhh. Not even close. If you think your speculation about what variables affect win rate WITHOUT PROOF is even close to the certainty regarding other \"Theories\" such as gravity and evolution you are deluded. Do you honestly believe there is no evidence or facts to support the theory of gravity? That some guy just guessed about it and everyone agreed because it's common sense? No. There must be rigorous testing, experiments, and data before something is considered a scientific theory.\n\nWhat you have is a hypothesis. I am not saying the hypothesis doesn't make sense or isn't true, I am saying no one has tested it yet most seem to take it as true. For example, your explanation is that higher pick rate but low win rate actually means the champ is better than indicated because more people new to the champ play it, but its \"mains\" have a much higher win rate. Thus, the high pick rate artificially lowers the overall win rate. That's cool. It makes sense. I could see that. That doesn't make it true. Maybe Lee Sin's low win rate is because he's not that OP and the only reason people thinks hes strong or pick him a lot is because he is played in LCS a lot.\n\n> You're welcome to say \"there's no facts to back up\" my statements, but frankly then you're adopting the same dogmatic attitude as those who attack theories on the basis that \"you can't prove it\".\n\nI completely disagree. The theory of gravity and evolution have both been proven using actual experimentation and observation. They may not know all the details but for all intents and purposes they are proven. Dogmatic would be saying that the Creationists are right because it \"makes sense\" even if there is no proof. If anything, I am being scientific by demanding some evidence for these claims everyone makes about why win rate is useless. I also never asked for proof but evidence other than mere speculation.\n\nI think you completely missed my point. Moreover, is it really that hard or impossible to come up with some statistic for win/loss ratio of a champion, but only count games where the player has played that champ at least x times? In fact, I think I saw a post with just that information on either these message boards or on Reddit but I can't seem to find it. I would be shocked if this information wasn't available. Why you think such a task is impossible I have no idea.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"AMYS GRAVE","date":"2015-04-14T23:10:55.027+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Win rates aren't an accurate measure of a champion's strength, but they are an indicator to be taken into account with other factors.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tibberino","date":"2015-04-14T22:27:44.443+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"What ends up giving champions high winrates are:\n\n1.

It's about her overall performance (not just in ranked but also in normals). Sejuani is a solid pick at all levels of play. She doesn't really counter anyone, but there's no one who counters her either because she can easily dash over a wall or slow someone who's chasing her.","replies":[{"poster":"GundayMonday","date":"2015-04-15T20:35:54.932+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Try playing Trundle against her.
