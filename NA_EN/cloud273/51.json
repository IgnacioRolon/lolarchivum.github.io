What if instead of flat regen there was an item that healed based on how low your hp was? Higher regen if your hp is lower than a certain percent, and normal regen if your hp is higher than that percent. The exact numbers Riot can decide.","replies":[{"poster":"Athenes Lulu","date":"2017-09-27T06:55:23.838+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Warmogs used to do that.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Khristophoros","date":"2017-09-27T06:15:29.742+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Originally Spirit Visage did that and I thought it was really fun.

With lower health health regen spikes to 200% and normally its 100%. I'd like to see more variety in health regen items though.
