But guess what? You can also purchase them with RP. I get that the content is supposed to be random, but if you&#039;re buying something with REAL MONEY the least they can do is give you something you don&#039;t already own. It&#039;s stupid when you get something like a Jax shard (assuming you already own Jax).","replies":[{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2017-08-28T08:56:02.640+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"No it's not.\n\n1. its a company trying to make money.\n2. No one forces you to buy chest.\n3. Everyone has the knowledge you have a change to receive something you already own, so its the person whose willing to spend money's fault.","replies":[]},{"poster":"EternalSmiley","date":"2017-08-28T12:28:57.682+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also its an RNG system. tons of games have them and people love it. The thrill of getting something you don't have vs something you do have is a rush for people. It's all about Risk vs reward, if it was purely rewards it wouldn't be as fun.","replies":[]}]}
