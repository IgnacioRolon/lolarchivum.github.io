Even while simply holding it in front of you, you can charge into the opponent and smash your weight against the shield, likely stunning if not injuring your opponent\n\nhere's another thing, in traditional staff fighting, most weapons are nearly useless because you can disable your opponent while maintaining a distance.  In Jax's case, he can spin a staff fast enough to stop even a bullet\n\nthis is all magic stuff, now imagine a staff (solid metal) being spun at hundreds of miles per hour (a kilometer is roughly 3/5 to 2/3 of a mile)\n\neven an ordinary staff can still cause damage while defending, let alone \"the grandmaster at arms\" expertise with it\n\nthat's the beauty of magic when applied to physics and real examples.

Don't expect him NOT to use his counterstrike.  It's an adaptive ability for offense or defense.  You use abilities and defenses to your advantage.  Jax has the means to engage, but he has no poke damage, little disengage, no healing or shield and he usually burns his defensive ability to engage his target.

Weaken him from a range if possible and disengage when he gets too close.  Your own crowd control can help with this.

It's almost like Jax's counterstrike is not a solely defensive move, and it's intended to enable him to trade better, or survive. You're labeling it something it's not, and then complaining about it not being 'good design' based on your own misconceptions.

I really can't understand the concept that the ability isn't a purely defensive ability is somehow against 'basic design'. Cause wow, I could've sworn how many times I've used my Sion shield to deal damage. And if you tell me that Sion's shield is intended to be able to function offensively, than I can tell you that Jax's Counterstrike was intended to be used offensively as it can be defensively. \n> \n> Cause wow-wee, if you look at the game as a whole, a lot of the defensive moves can be used offensively, because they have offense in mind. Fiora can use hers to stun enemys if she blocks CC, an offensive trait to a defensive move.

You're labeling it something it's not, and then complaining about it not being 'good design' based on your own misconceptions.\n\nI feel like character design with intended balance should generally follow the idea that if someone has 100% of it's power invested in attack, then a defensive character should be something like 30/70% offense/defense, and the two should be able to match each other blow for blow, because defense blocks 70% of the opponent's 100% offense, leaving both at 30% offense. If that makes sense.\n\nOf course there's a bajillion other factors to consider in here too like mobility, multi target abilities, ability uptime, strong early VS late, and such. But, gonna have to admit, there are no, or next to no tanks currently able to go blow for blow against pretty much any AD champions in 1v1's at equivalent gold.","replies":[{"poster":"GonahtanuGepardi","date":"2019-08-07T10:18:17.740+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":">there are no, or next to no tanks currently able to go blow for blow against pretty much any AD champions in 1v1's at equivalent gold.\n\nAnd they shouldn't. Tanks are utility champions that rely on their teammates to deal damage. They aren't designed to be 1v1 champions. A bruiser is supposed to beat a tank in 1v1 but the tank is supposed to be more useful in a team fight.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"PaladinNO","date":"2019-08-07T07:50:03.688+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":">\"Jax enters a defensive stance\"\n\nhttps://66.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ma8za4bNyX1rdhs82o4_r1_250.gif https://66.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ma8za4bNyX1rdhs82o5_r1_250.gif https://66.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ma8za4bNyX1rdhs82o3_r1_500.gif\n\n\"The best defense is a good offense.\"","replies":[]}]}
