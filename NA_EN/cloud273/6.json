Different expectations lead to a lot of cases of allies jumping out just before Tahm's ult went off, resulting in Tahm's who were irked they ulted without company they'd been planning on. Swapping to an opt in model helped a lot with that.","replies":[{"poster":"Jeddy017","date":"2017-01-18T07:55:53.100+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, I could totally see that. \nYou eat a buddy planning to ult away from a bad fight. But then they jump out as you zip on out of there. Since they would likely be an idiot, they would blame-flame you for leaving them while you facepalm.\n\nIt would have been Thresh lantern all over again. Except it would be less clear because the buddy probably didn't know the Tahm was planning to ult somewhere. Unless they were using some communication program.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sir Poodle","date":"2017-01-18T03:19:19.740+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also, I think that it might be annoying:\n\n\"Thanks, Tahm!

Just give his allies a way to jump out of Tahm's mouth if they don't wanna be there. But yes there is potential for trolling in it's current state lol.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Demon King Maou","date":"2017-01-18T02:27:56.110+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Would make game too easy ;p","replies":[]},{"poster":"Trash Goblin","date":"2017-01-18T04:59:20.397+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"On a closely related note, Kench's Devour being locked out after he ults can make ulting in for a mad clutch save feel... a bit difficult, at best. I know it'd possibly be an excessive powerspike, but did you ever consider allowing Kench to target an ally with his ultimate, so that as he leaps from the ground at his destination he devours them?","replies":[]}]}
