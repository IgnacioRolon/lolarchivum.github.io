Singed is proxy farming bot. My team decides to send 2 people bot to deal with the Singed, even though I tell them to ignore him. The dead person on their team comes back up, and it becomes a 3 v 4 mid. We can&#039;t retreat, cuz mobility creep, and we get wrecked. Enemy team proceeds to snowball from that point and we lose. And the singed wasn&#039;t even fed. The Singed was 2 and 11. TLDR PLEASE ignore Singed. He does not split push well at all. Kill his team while he afk farms and win.","replies":[{"poster":"TequilaZombie","date":"2016-10-26T02:31:06.221+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't listen to this man, he's out of his mind!
