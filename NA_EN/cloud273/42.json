There are champions with significantly less counterplay in this game. Almost nothing that Fizz does can be dodged, except his ult, and the amount of safety he gets from his passive and playful is just stupid (not to mention the low cooldown on playful/trickster). Zed and Leblanc are also some of the safest champs in existence, because they have instant repositioning, untargetability with their ults (Zed), and super safe poke. Talon can just jump over one of the numerous walls in this game if he ever f*cks up, and has one of the most powerful cc&#039;s in this game. He also has a slow with an ENORMOUS cone which is almost impossible to dodge in lane. Yasuo by contrast has super low base hp, almost no poke, an ult that he can&#039;t even use half the time, and garbage damage without his crit items (which cost about 6000 gold btw). Until he gets his gold, he's literally a free kill whenever you want. Oh, you used your dash? Guess that's a free kill for anyone who feels like ganking. And when he actually gets his damage from said crit items his crits don&#039;t even do full damage. Meanwhile Tryndamere gets 35% free crit at level 1 and is allowed to have full damage criits (he also gets invincibility btw). The cooldown on his &quot;safety&quot; ability (wind wall) is 26 second at rank 1, which is absolutely insane, and none of his core items have cdr. Finally, Yasuo&#039;s so called &quot;mobility&quot; is completely unreliable. Unlike assassins and other champions with mobility (Azir, Garen, etc) he actually NEEDS A TARGET in order to do anything, and the animation on the dash is insanely long. He also can only dash through a target once, and the distance of the dash puts him in an EXTREMELY dangerous position. And again unlike assassins he can&#039;t just immediately escape after he jumps into a fight.","replies":[]}
