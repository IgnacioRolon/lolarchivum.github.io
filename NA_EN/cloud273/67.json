However, because his abilities cost health and several of his abilities are skillshots (unlike the other 3 junglers), he definitely has a higher learning curve than other junglers, which leads people to think he is &quot;weak&quot; and needs a rework. Agree or disagree?\n\nAlso, I'm not saying jungling is the only thing Aatrox should do, but he seems to synergize well with the jungle items. He's finally found his niche.","replies":[{"poster":"Jbels","date":"2016-02-13T01:12:44.743+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well considering his base stats are terrible, he does no damage without items, and he is literally worthless in teamfights if he hasn't snowballed out of control, then yes, I would say he is that bad","replies":[]},{"poster":"Slamurai Jack","date":"2016-02-13T01:37:07.406+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"He's better than people think but still not that good. You can definitely win games with him but better champs would probably be easier.","replies":[{"poster":"Cherysse","date":"2016-02-13T01:49:51.063+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"All that Aatrox needs is a buff to his HP per level, he is nowhere near any melee champ and his sustain doesn't compense for the fact that he CONSUMES his own life to cast spells.\nOtherwise Ive found Hybrid Aatrox to be a really succesful build, mainly because the sustain/damage/tankyness is crazy","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"The Voids Call","date":"2016-02-13T02:46:08.320+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He's not \"weaker\" he's just inconsistent. Miss a Q, you have no hard CC, miss your slow moving E, you have no CC at all. His W hits hard if you max it, but it's probably not enough to miss your targeted first. Also his Q can be interrupted, something i feel they should change.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Droogzy","date":"2016-02-13T02:23:29.614+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He definitely not as bad as people claim, he's pretty good in the right hands.\n\nThen again, so is urgot in the right hands.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Loveless","date":"2016-02-13T02:21:58.439+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Needs his crazy attack speed back if he earns it. Right now he has to buy too many stats to be worth a shit, but then being a ball of stats means he doesn't have a strong point, and can only be good with full build...so why bother?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Athenes Lulu","date":"2016-02-13T01:55:37.716+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sounds like almost every \"underplayed\" champion out there.","replies":[]},{"poster":"charcharmunro","date":"2016-02-13T01:35:34.141+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I often see people playing Aatrox more like Yi/Jax, as a careful duelist who hangs back until he can go in. He's really more meant to be a hyper-aggressive balls-to-the-wall fighter, going in and going ham. Of course that only works if he's fed, but... Yeah.","replies":[]}]}
