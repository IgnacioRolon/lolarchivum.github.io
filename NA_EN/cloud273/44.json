Knock ups.  If your adc screws up , as treshuse W, use Q, use E, and even after that they are still engaging, use R and exaust. Oh, you are winning the fight? Bring him back with W, usa E, use Q and use R to screw the other team disengage. Way too much utility in his kit.\n\nWith janna the problem is the same. Q for engage/disengage, W for engage disengage, E for engage disengage, and even her R is for engage/disengage (if you position yourself proper). Janna is a worse offender since you can't predict by any means where her Q is going to land.\n\nLeona is especialized in engage, but only has 3 of these tools made for that. Alistar is the same, only Q and E have a utility combat value.","replies":[{"poster":"Togekiss24","date":"2015-01-14T06:21:15.498+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Janna is at least relatively squishy (even with her shield), and her Q, if you are paying attention, is VERY easy to see coming (even if she does it in a bush, mind you) so she's at least counterable to some extent.\n\nThresh is pretty much good at everything. He progressively builds armor with his passive, has an engage, multiple effective disengages, AND decent ranged AA. Most other engage supports lack one aspect in exchange for being stronger in another, but not him.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2015-01-14T13:23:29.431+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Janna isnt even OP. She is good at fighting hard engage and assassins. Guess what the meta is?\n\nI honestly dont think her nerfs on the pbe need to happen.
