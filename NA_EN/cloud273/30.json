For one thing, most XBOX One controllers (and PS4 controllers too I think) come with a mic now, so instead of typing everything out you can just use the mic in your controller. Voice recognition software exists (Xfinity anyone?), so what if the game was able to recognize what the person was saying and put that into the chat box. This could be useful in champ select and in game. A button on the controller would allow you to switch between all chat and team chat.\r\n\r\nMoving your character around is also very simple. One control stick controls movement, while the other controls the camera, and the buttons are used for abilities. Consumables and item actives can also be assigned to buttons. Most modern controllers have enough buttons that there should be enough for all your item actives.","replies":[{"poster":"Live2LetDie","date":"2017-03-15T21:18:28.226+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"1.
