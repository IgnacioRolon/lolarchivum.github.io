The amount of survivability assassins have in their kits is absolutely insane. And let&#039;s not forget about the massive buffs armor pen items got this year. TLDR assassins are way too easy to play and the class as a whole needs some serious gutting.\n\nOh, and I forgot. Most of them are also manaless.

Rather than strong defenses they are typically either rewarded heavily for killing the opponent or just evade damage altogether. \n\nAssassins are not heavy survivability champs and will be punished somewhat for trying to be.
