The fact that people even complain about him in the first place just blows my mind. We have champs like Xin, Tryndamere and Teemo whose entire kits are point and click and require zero skill whatsoever to play. The fact is, if Yasuo doesn&#039;t hit his &#039;q&#039;, he&#039;s not doing sh*t to you, unless you&#039;re stupid enough to let him walk up to you and auto attack you to death. And if he does manage to hit you, it&#039;s not like he&#039;s doing 100% crit damage.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-04-02T00:01:07.696+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"skillshot champ\".\n\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-clap}}","replies":[{"poster":"jinxedchef","date":"2017-04-02T00:04:45.601+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well I guess he has one.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"1wolfpack","date":"2017-04-02T00:28:33.612+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I get it, its an April Fools day prank\nhahaha I get jokes\n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cheetah Nidalee","date":"2017-04-02T01:06:47.982+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"LOL skillshot?\n\nwhat his tornado? yeah..  except all he has to do is use his dash on you and then press it. so not really","replies":[{"poster":"SwiftKitten88","date":"2017-04-02T01:22:24.251+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Cheetah Nidalee,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=UjwyfbpH,comment-id=0009,timestamp=2017-04-02T01:06:47.982+0000)\n>\n> LOL skillshot?\n> \n> what his tornado? yeah..  except all he has to do is use his dash on you and then press it. so not really\n\nyeah back in the day when nid could lane , i could beat 90% of yasuo's in lane.\n\nbecuase in my elo.. 9/10 yasuo's did NOT used the knockup on their dash... the 10% that did would absolutely DESTROY me every game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cloud273","date":"2017-04-02T01:52:29.019+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Cheetah Nidalee,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=UjwyfbpH,comment-id=0009,timestamp=2017-04-02T01:06:47.982+0000)\n>\n> LOL skillshot?\n> \n> what his tornado? yeah..  except all he has to do is use his dash on you and then press it. so not really\n\nHe has to land his 'q' twice in order to get it. If you let him land his 'q' twice you deserve whatever happens. And if he does get it, don't stand near the minions he hasn't dashed to yet. And even if he lands a knockup, you can still cc him and he's not able to ult you. Like I said dude, there's so much counterplay it's stupid.

That's no reason to complain about Yasuo. You can't give him mana because then he becomes a Ryze, building Mana all the time. Energy is reserved for specific champions such as Ninja's, too. However, you can find a way to give him energy by refunding an energy cost when he E's + Q's. I could see that happening.\n\n> Not as though he has a free escape/gap closer\n\nWhile the gap closer is not situational, the \"free escape\" is very situational, and thus not a viable point either. His jungle mobility is only just as good as Lee Sin's jungle mobility.\n\n> the best defensive spell in the game(one that stops almost every source of damage in the game)\n\nTrynd ult stops all damage for longer than wind wall can be up after use. Kayle ult not as long as wind wall after use but a lot more effective. Kindred's is the best defensive spell, but is restricted by it also affecting monsters and enemy champions.\n\n> free shield\n\nNo way in hell that shield is \"free\". Late game, you have to spend an eternity walking to pop it up. While it blocks almost less than 100 damage (resistances aren't applied with the shield, like other shields) early game. And in most matchups in mid lane, it's nearly useless unless Yasuo has his top priority to preserve it or the enemy has no idea how to auto attack if ranged.\n\n> gets a ton of free stats\n\nHas less AS built into him than Yi, one of the champions with no scaling MR, 55 base attack damage, base armor is TWENTY FIVE, and 518 base HP. This compensates for \"free stats\" which is only double crit, which is also compensated by reduced critical strike damage. Clearly you have no idea what you are talking about.","replies":[{"poster":"Inari Fox Orrion","date":"2017-04-02T00:59:20.030+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The issue is that he's resource-less AND has a free gap-closer and [situationally] escape AND a free shield that procs after 1-3s of running at full build AND gets double crit with an extremely minor drawback.\n\nYes, that shield IS free. It costs nothing to him. It may be weaker than \"normal\" shields, but it's innately stronger in terms of health and you get it by MOVING and nothing else. .\n\nYes, that double crit counts as \"free stats\". As much as you want to tell yourself otherwise, his base stats are actually near the top of the line. Not in terms of Lv1, but in terms of growth and Lv10/Lv18. \n\nThird-highest base HP/5 in the game. Easily mitigates that \"low health\" you talk about.\nThird-highest base AS in the game. It means he makes more use of AS than Yi does.\nYou'd have a point about his health, if it didn't have 82 growth/Lv.\nYou'd have a point about his AD, if it wasn't higher than 73 other champions.\nYou'd have a point about his armor, if it didn't exceed Ali/Riven's.\nYou have a point about his MR, but that's one weakness compared to endless strengths.\nDid I mention he has the highest unconditional melee attack range?\n\nSorry to shoot you down, but I'm really tired of people defending him. \nHe might be balanced, or might not, I don't care. \nAll I know is I want to AFK whenever I have to fight one.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Eedat","date":"2017-04-02T00:02:36.557+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The salt","replies":[]},{"poster":"Big Lincoln","date":"2017-04-02T01:35:25.417+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Cloud273 is one of the best and smartest posters on this board, and a true pillar of the community \n\npraise be to Cloud273","replies":[]}]}
