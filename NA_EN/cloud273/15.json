He can have all the benefits of a mage (doing magic damage) while having the benefits of an ADC (lifesteal, crit, strong auto-attacks) without drawbacks. It is simply... absurd.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Melledoneus","date":"2016-03-16T05:27:59.510+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Please.

If you've watched pro matches you'd notice that the moment that warning goes off the entire enemy team immediately stops trying to make any offensive moves until it either wears off or Corki uses it. I used to spam him for a bit and my most memorable moment was brainlessly using the package into a group of 5 that had just got done doing dragon. Despite the fact that I died before I could cast any more spells, I got a quadra kill from the grave.\n\nMy main problem though is how he just does everything. He's a mobile-burst-dps-poke-mage-marksman-duelist-antitank hybrid with a passive that rivals the strongest ults in the game. It isn't uncommon for my bot ADC Corki to outright kill assassins that try to pounce on me without even being fed.
