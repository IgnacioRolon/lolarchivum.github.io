The ones that have just the left and right buttons and the wheel in the middle (not the ones with a million buttons on them, and not the wireless ones either). Anyways, about a month ago I was out shopping for a new mouse because my old one wasn&#039;t working properly. I told them I was looking for a gaming mouse, and the mouses they showed me didn&#039;t look fancy at all. Just the left and right buttons and the wheel (and the cord attached to it, not the wireless ones). Now you&#039;d think that these simple mouses (no new technology or anything) would be the cheaper ones. But no, apparently these &quot;fancy gaming mouses&quot; are the most expensive. I find it hilarious that stores charge you more for a piece of outdated technology.","replies":[]}
