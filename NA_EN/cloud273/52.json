If he hits an ally with it their attack speed goes up.

It was changed shortly after because it was 2 stronk. While I much prefer playing AP ezreal over ADC ezreal, I can see why people play him AD and don't play him AP. He is very weak early game as an AP champ and takes a while to scale. His late game teamfight ults destroy people though XD\n\nTeamfight starts, you ult, enemy team is now at half health XD","replies":[]},{"poster":"463","date":"2017-02-01T00:00:34.433+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's already someone who plays APC Ezreal bot lane in like Master or Chall\n\nNo idea what you're saying\n\nThe only way you can promote something is bring it to light and hopefully everyone on stream starts playing it then it will \" become meta \"","replies":[]},{"poster":"oSEXYPLATYPUSo","date":"2017-02-01T00:20:57.473+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i just thought he was an AD CASTER mage \n\nbut who knows...","replies":[]}]}
