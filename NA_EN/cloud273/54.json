It seems that DOT mages were hurt pretty bad with this mage update, since Swain is doing pretty bad as well. Cassiopeia is currently at a 38% win rate for top (her best role currently), and that&#039;s just pathetic. I don&#039;t know if the issue is with the item changes, or with the changes to Cassiopeia herself, but she clearly needs some help. Swain could also use some love, as 39% win rate isn&#039;t that much better.\r\n\r\nhttp://champion.gg/statistics/#?sortBy=general.winPercent&amp;order=descend","replies":[{"poster":"Quepha","date":"2016-05-10T19:01:00.151+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Considering she was a high-tier pick at LCS, you aren't really saying much.","replies":[{"poster":"Leu07","date":"2016-05-10T22:00:35.147+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"For like what? 3 months? riot gutted her then, she is not allowed to remain strong and relevant EVER.","replies":[{"poster":"Quepha","date":"2016-05-10T22:03:51.551+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Leu07,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=oQol2uEB,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2016-05-10T22:00:35.147+0000)\n>\n> For like what? 3 months? riot gutted her then, she is not allowed to remain strong and relevant EVER.\n\nIn pro play she was strong for a long time, the problem was that it was hard keeping her under control in pro games without making her a guaranteed loss in normals. The rework should hopefully bring those two levels of performance closer together so that, once her numbers are properly balanced, she can have a little better winrate in solo queue while still being viable in pro play without being oppressive.","replies":[{"poster":"Ahegao Bunny","date":"2016-05-11T09:52:09.207+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Seriously... who cares about her winrate in solo Q when people play her who don't know what to do with her.

If you look at her winrate on lolking.net (and Swain's win rate as well), it's very similar to her winrate on champion.gg. My point is that it doesn't really matter what tier you're playing in. The performance of the champion is pretty much the same no matter where you go.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Queen Viper","date":"2016-05-10T22:16:24.354+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"... still WIP.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fives55555","date":"2016-05-10T19:19:24.579+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I played Cassi, she's easier to play now, but not as strong as before and not as fun.
