Without the hook they have to improvise pretty heavily for anything but a defensive play, and it's a clear opening in both kits (such that Thresh even relies on landing it to manage the cooldown effectively).\n\nI'd suggest taking time to play against them specifically and focus on how their hooks work, and how to best foil them (and who does it). When in doubt, a Banshee's is a good shot against both since they're both lacking ways to fake out the shield terribly reliably.\n\nOf course, it might be the case that they have really good help who capitalize on their opportunities more closely than you do on yours.

That means one of two things, or both. He's not overpowered, or you need to learn how to deal with him","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"HaIlMonitor","date":"2017-04-30T23:24:00.540+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They are fine... {{champion:51}}  with them isnt... lol","replies":[]}]}
