Xin is strong for sure, but he doesn&#039;t have the mobility that the other popular attack speed junglers have. If he gets caught, all he can do is use his ult or die. And his attack speed steroid and heal aren&#039;t that great. Everyone making a big deal about Xin after this tiny buff, but there are still stronger junglers out there. Anyways, that&#039;s just my opinion. What do you think?","replies":[{"poster":"Venowolf","date":"2016-02-24T02:23:53.686+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"IMO All of them need a nerf. Right now, are the most powerful junglers (Udyr and Xin receives a fair nerfs on PBE). I'm afraid about the Shyvanna state, she is OP in this moment and Rito need to do something with her, I mean not a huge nerf but some like Xin or Udyr nerfs  is neccesary.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wenderwall","date":"2016-02-16T20:06:33.164+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Whoever get's fed first/fastest.","replies":[]},{"poster":"HandheldBrandon","date":"2016-02-14T20:28:46.670+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Of all the ones Udyr probably has the biggest overall impact.\n\nHe brings damage, Mobility, Map control and tankiness which is really hard to beat.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AlwaysByMySide","date":"2016-02-14T20:25:55.057+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Speedy Udyr.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JavelinJoe","date":"2016-02-14T20:24:24.248+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yi like always","replies":[]}]}
