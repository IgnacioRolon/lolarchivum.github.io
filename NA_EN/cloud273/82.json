Anyways, the console itself is $300, and it doesn&#039;t come with a game. I can get an XBOX one console for less than $300 that also comes with a game. If you want extra joycons (the &#039;basic&#039; controllers), that&#039;s $80. These are the smallest controllers I&#039;ve ever seen, and the technology in them really isn&#039;t that impressive. The pro controller (which looks more like an XBOX controller) costs $70. Finally, the docking station for the console itself is $90. I dunno about you guys, but at the current price it doesn&#039;t seem worth it.","replies":[]}
