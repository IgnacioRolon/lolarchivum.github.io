Everything else about him sucks. His &#039;e&#039; isn&#039;t even that safe either because 99% of the time he doesn&#039;t even have the mana to use it, and the distance he can travel isn&#039;t very far. On top of this, he has the worst base hp of all adc&#039;s, the worst passive of all adc&#039;s the highest cooldowns, the highest mana costs, and the worst waveclear. His abilities are also way too easy to dodge, unlike with other adc&#039;s, who just right click you and do tons of damage. There is absolutely no reason to play Ezreal. He&#039;s more of a liability to his team than anything.","replies":[{"poster":"Joseph Gladstone","date":"2017-01-27T02:07:37.788+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"i absolutely disagree with everything you said","replies":[{"poster":"EndlessSorcerer","date":"2017-01-27T03:09:25.763+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, Ezreal _can_ use on-hit effects.\n\nThey got something right.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TyrekGoldenspear","date":"2017-01-27T03:01:08.136+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:81}} You belong in a museum!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sugar Momma","date":"2017-01-27T02:04:11.252+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ezreal is probably the most balanced ADC atm and he's really strong pick if you are skilled with him.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Touch My Box","date":"2017-01-27T02:16:39.893+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Worst Passive?\n\nRemember he has two.\n\nHis Q means his cooldowns are extremely low, and he gets 70% attackspeed free. That's a pretty nice passive.\n\n\n\nIf you aren't retarded or you build {{item:3025}} {{item:3153}} {{item:3042}}  you have a very hard hitting AoE permaslow, you will have high CDR and your blink ends up with a few seconds on cooldown. \n\nHe might have the lowest hp of adcs, but he also has very long range with his Q and incredible kite with his E.\n\nIf you think he is crap, you are just playing him wrong.\n\n\n\"His abilities are also way too easy to dodge, unlike with other adc's, who just right click you and do tons of damage\"\n\nYou know you can still build him like a regular ADC, and still do tonnes of damage with autoattacks, right?\nBT/IE/Trinity/SS/PD/LDR is still a viable build, it is just less safe and focused more on short teamfights because your mana will be low.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Akali Prime","date":"2017-01-27T02:22:01.542+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"imma just assume you've just tried to play ezreal and failed miserably because every single word you've just said is a flat out lie.\nand i think you belong in a museum","replies":[{"poster":"Cloud273","date":"2017-01-27T02:54:50.126+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Hells bellsX,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=LbLRye9v,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2017-01-27T02:22:01.542+0000)\n>\n> imma just assume you&#x27;ve just tried to play ezreal and failed miserably because every single word you&#x27;ve just said is a flat out lie.\n> and i think you belong in a museum\n\nWhat did i say that's not true?
