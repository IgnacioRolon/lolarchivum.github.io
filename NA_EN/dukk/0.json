A couple of games in I started to experience extreme consistent internet lag bringing my ping up to 6000 in some cases on my Aorus X7 Pro. My friend, literally sitting next to me on the same network was still receiving fluid 66 ping. I couldn't even leave base and it kept attempting to reconnect while my friend was duking it out on the rift, no issues. I tried restarting my computer, disconnecting other devices, restarting both computers, and now I am reinstalling league. I have a feeling this won't fix my issue and I would like to know if there is a known fix to this. I'm very disappointed because I have now received a lower priority queue for being unwillingly disconnected.\n\nYour help is very appreciated.\n\nSincerely,\nBFS","replies":[{"poster":"Redic","date":"2017-02-26T12:55:59.261+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"@Dukk I've experienced the exact same thing last night. It wasn't my first game of the day and I qued for ranked. As soon as the game loading screen popped up, it showed I had 400+ latency. I assumed it was something that was going to be very brief and go away, but lo and behold the latency issue has not gone away. I've reset my router, checked for downloads, and even re-downloaded the client (which didn't help). And it's also something to add that league is the only game this is happening too. I'm just glad to know I'm not the only one out there that's having this issue. Would love a response for a possible fix to this issue.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-27T00:27:36.013+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Were both of these computers connected to the network with the same connection type? (WiFi, Ethernet). If so, it's likely that the issue is with the network adapter in your Aorus X7 Pro. I'd first recommend visiting Aorus' support site and ensure your network drivers are completely up to date.\n\nLet me know if this helped.","replies":[]}]}
