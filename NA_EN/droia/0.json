Does Viktor killed Vel&#039;Koz and created a machine-like? Is this in the future (that would suck) or is a totally an alternative Universe?   Or is something like Vel&#039;koz ascended and became a god (Arch light skin) and Viktor created the Battlecast-Vel&#039;koz using Vel&#039;koz lifeform as a model? \n\nAnd will be new Vel'koz skins in recent future :D?\n\nTy and sorry for my English (is not my native language)","replies":[{"poster":"Carnival Knights","date":"2018-04-09T17:57:47.020+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Skins writer here. In the Battlecast universe, Victor has killed off most of the world's living organisms and transplanted their brains into his robots. Most, if not all, of the void creatures are extinct.
