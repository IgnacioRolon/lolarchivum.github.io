Other than that game (swears after swears),\n\nOne game, unless it's blatant hate speech, will not get someone permabanned.  It has to be a history of it, since the system has levels (you know this.)  Coarse language if not directed at anyone won't get you banned either unless super excessive (not even sure if that would do it?).  It's directing that language at players that makes it reportable.\n>there was a few others where one, I either only swore because I was saying \"fuck i stole your \" or \"wtf that ahri somehow killed me bull shit LOL\" \n\nIf that was the extent of it, again not really actionable.  They account for saltyness and know people are passionate for the game.\n>or two, somebody in champion select told me to say something in game, and I did, \"everybody in spam in chat alex is a fucking nigge*\" and so I did, because I felt like having fun.\n\n*facepalm* why would you even do that....\n\n>I don't get why how in one game, a few reports that actually were true, can get me banned,\n\nOne report will flag the system to review the game; multiple reports do nothing.\n>while in a few other games, people like the enemy abuse the report system just because they were either salty because they lost, or they just got tilted and decided to report everybody for no reason.\n\nThe reports are checked if they're valid or not before they're acted on, false reports do absolutely nothing.  They're worthless.\n>Mean while, while I'm over here getting chat restricted for one game,\n\nCan't be one game unless it was the hate speech; how many games were in the logs?\nI know that's supposed to be a sampling of the games that brought attention to your account.\n>there are other players who constantly flame and swear almost every sentence, and who are lucky enough that people don't take the extra 3 seconds that it takes to report somebody. And on top of that, I know that they don't get punished!\n\nHow do you know if they got punished or not?  Maybe they're on their way up the escalation system right now?  What they did doesn't make what you did any more pardonable.  Everyone is responsible for their own actions, and we (as players) have collectively decided (through reporting it over and over) what is punishable and they made the system with those parameters.  It's not Riot's rules technically, it's the players of NA's rules.\n>Please, riot, I beg of you, that you take the time to look over reports, and see what is actually punishable or not. Because in cases like mine, the majority of the reports are complete bs, and because you have the Tribunal set on auto-punish, \n\nI'm pretty sure the only thing really on instant auto-punish is leaverbuster :/\n>players who have one-two bad games get punished, while the other ones who have \"bad games\" every game are left untouched.

Welcome to League.\n\nI think the important thing to remember is that most of the bizarre chat which happens after someone dies or whatever, is written down in a text file and spewed out semi-randomly, it's called a 'humanizer' (it's one kind) and it sounds fake and stupid to you, but it's good enough to fool Riot support. So maybe if you know that most of those accounts are usually 1 person, and the rest bots it will help not to respond.","replies":[]}]}
