For example, I can be clicking to move somewhere or to cast my abilities and the guy just stands still and does nothing.\r\n\r\nOr if I have a move command somewhere and it does this freeze then he'll continue to just move forward regardless of any action given to him for like 1 or 2 seconds.\r\n\r\nPing at constant 40 and FPS at constant 200+.\r\n\r\nI restarted my computer, and now I'm thinking about reinstalling League to see if that does anything. Just started happening today and it happens every game. I haven't played ranked yet, just normals. Is this happening to anyone else?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-07-07T18:35:26.789+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you're experiencing packet loss or extreme packet buffering.
