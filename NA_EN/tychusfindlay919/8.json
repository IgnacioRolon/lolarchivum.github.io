Make flat apply before %, remove edge of night (no nerfs, removal of the item. if you want a spell shield, get a banshees and suck it up), and this horrid meta will end, and lethality will go to assassins and whisper to marksmen and champions like riven can go fuck themselves because they always break new AD shit coming in. And make these changes NEXT PATCH, because it's not hard to just reverse a calculation.\n\nEDIT\n\nFor those wondering, we lost that game. Riven snowballed, and by the time we started stacking armor they were adding whispers to their flat pen and nothing mattered.\n\nDOUBLE EDIT\n\nIn response to the \"Why did you build SV?\" posts... Not factoring in runic armor, SV makes:\n\none man decimate heal 15% (base 12%)\ntwo man decimate heal 30% (base 24%)\nthree man decimate heal 45% missing HP (base 36%)\n\nthat's fucking huge, and now I will not respond anymore to the spirit visage posts. Waste of my time. As HP increases, the heal amp becomes more and more valuable, and as their pen increases and they get LW items on top of lethality, the armor I would get with a frozen heart or thornmail becomes less and less relevant. No I don't use mobafire, I use my brain. Frozen heart licks balls because they're all prioritizing burst, not an AS DPS build.\n\nAlso, between tabis, randuins, scaling armor runes, darius's retardedly high base armor, and a cloth armor, I had well over 200 armor which gets bumped up a ton for 2 seconds because I had the fearless mastery, which burst lethality builds should be suffering heavily against if it wasn't so efficient to tack on % pen afterwards.","replies":[{"poster":"Eedat","date":"2017-02-19T19:30:45.500+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":24,"body":"Why on earth did you build a {{item:3065}} against an all AD team?","replies":[{"poster":"EndlessSorcerer","date":"2017-02-19T19:32:59.450+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":22,"body":"The curse of the cookie-cutter builds strikes again.\n\nFrozen Heart would have been such a good option too.","replies":[{"poster":"Critmaster Garen","date":"2017-02-19T20:52:26.785+0000","up_votes":26,"down_votes":4,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=EndlessSorcerer,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=YyXlWQkk,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2017-02-19T19:32:59.450+0000)\n>\n> The curse of the cookie-cutter builds strikes again.\n> \n> Frozen Heart would have been such a good option too.\n\nthey had last whisper and cleavers.\n\nfrozen heart doesnt save you.","replies":[{"poster":"EndlessSorcerer","date":"2017-02-19T20:54:29.997+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":8,"body":"It's a better option than building MR.","replies":[{"poster":"Critmaster Garen","date":"2017-02-19T20:57:15.660+0000","up_votes":26,"down_votes":5,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=EndlessSorcerer,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=YyXlWQkk,comment-id=0002000000010000,timestamp=2017-02-19T20:54:29.997+0000)\n>\n> It&#x27;s a better option than building MR.\n\nis it though? the mr is wasted, but he still gets the health, cdr and healing amp.\n\nhow much of that armor is wasted after % pen when you compare those two items? more than a chain vest, which is 800 gold worth. \n\nwhats left of the item is 45 armor before cleaver shred, some mana, cdr and an insignificant aura against ad casters. does that give you more protection than 500 health and increased heals?\n\na health/mr item against a full ad team in this case offers actually equal or more protection than a frozen heart. its petty sad.","replies":[{"poster":"Tychusfindlay919","date":"2017-02-19T21:09:25.439+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":4,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Critmaster Garen,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=YyXlWQkk,comment-id=00020000000100000000,timestamp=2017-02-19T20:57:15.660+0000)\n>\n> is it though? the mr is wasted, but he still gets the health, cdr and healing amp.\n> \n> how much of that armor is wasted after % pen when you compare those two items? more than a chain vest, which is 800 gold worth. \n> \n> whats left of the item is 45 armor before cleaver shred, some mana, cdr and an insignificant aura against ad casters. does that give you more protection than 500 health and increased heals?\n> \n> a health/mr item against a full ad team in this case offers actually equal or more protection than a frozen heart. its petty sad.\n\nExactly, and I remember a while ago they changed spirit visage by lowering the MR it gives and amping up the % heal to 25% increased heal.

Even 300 is hard for a average game.  And There are other factors we must consider as well.\n\nThere are 3 primary lethality ADCs played, {{champion:202}} {{champion:21}} {{champion:110}} . \n\nJhin first, deals...fairly mixed damage between autos and abilities however his ultimate packs a punch and his fourth shot is a guaranteed crit, takes a while to load up however i´ve seen this hurt supposed tanks a ton.    Doesn't help that his passive is a weird mess of math that i haven't looked up but i know that building AD results in more damage than a normal auto attack in exchange for his reload mechanic however that more damage part is pretty important. \n\nThen MF, she will start her fights by....well ulting in, if a tank get's caught in this depending on a few circumstances the damage is usually around 2,2 k to 3,8. Dependent on how fed they are and what items used.  However that is a ton of damage regardless. I believe that it doesn't usually take much effort to kill a tank after that. \n\nVarus is a AD xerath meaning he´ll shot at enemy squishies from miles away and usually ignore enemy tanks however if he does get into a situation where he does need to auto attack the results depend on the tanks items. If the tank has magic resist he´ll be fine, if not then a good varus will shred the tank with his W. \n\n\nAnd assassins usually have abilities that allow them to hurt the tank plenty, talon for example, with his melee Q+W-AA doesnt just slaughter his mage victims, it actually hurts the tanks too.  \n\nZed...depends skill and opponent i guess but his potential ultimate damage is not a joke to be certain. \n\nThen for another we have graves, whom with lethality kills pretty much everything, koreans love and hate him for it.","replies":[{"poster":"Sun Wu Ryuumoku","date":"2017-02-20T12:10:20.550+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":">There are 3 primary lethality ADCs played,    .\n\n{{champion:202}} is weak af against Tank.

Gapclose her and auto her to death? Good luck there....People are hating both MF and that item for a good reason.  And in teamfights a tank will never have the chance to get a good MF, she will simply walk around and wait for your tank to engage then burn her ulti to kill him off. Then it's a 4v5 and easy from there, Koreans are abusing the hell out of this.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"EndlessSorcerer","date":"2017-02-20T03:52:54.755+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> The only reason people run lethality is because it reduces no armor targets to negative armor which results in increased damage.\n\nPenetration won't reduce resistances below 0.\n\nOnly flat reduction can do that (and it applies before everything else).","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Stillname","date":"2017-02-19T22:11:13.389+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Okay but what is the excuse for the rest of your team?\n\nExcept for kat none of them invested in armor which is just plain stupid vs an all ad team.

The problem is that he probably should have waited to build it and sat on the kindlegem because frankly the amount of magic damage that they were dealing at that time does not warrant grabbing the SV.  Personally I would have gone with a dead mans, because of the additional movement speed to stick to their (extremely) slippery team, and then after that I would have finished the SV and then grabbed another armor item.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Master Vemira","date":"2017-02-19T19:37:02.246+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":15,"body":"dude, what are you talking about? flat pen has gone before % pen since they nerfed last whisper, that was the ENTIRE REASON people were bitching about the last whisper changes back in season 5","replies":[{"poster":"EndlessSorcerer","date":"2017-02-19T19:39:38.998+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":0,"body":"The order of application is:\n\n* Flat Reduction\n* Percentage Reduction\n* Percentage Penetration\n* Flat Penetration\n\nThis has been true since ~Pre-S3.\n\nThe complaints regarding LW in S5 were about how it no longer penetrates base armor.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MaeDoSan","date":"2017-02-19T19:41:08.915+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lethality applies last","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"uulwi","date":"2017-02-19T21:33:12.076+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"I started going lethality on Ivern and never looked back!","replies":[{"poster":"Melledoneus","date":"2017-02-20T05:58:20.774+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:427}} A gift from the forest!\n{{champion:81}} OH MY GOD MY RIBS GAAAAAAH\n{{champion:427}} Uh-oh.
