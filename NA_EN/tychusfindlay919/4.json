If someone actually does jump her ass, she should pay dearly for it.\n\n&quot;Vayne is squishy git gud, vayne needs peel, vayne needs this and that and this&quot;\n\nHa, she is a hell of a lot more self sufficient than many other hypercarries: {{champion:222}} {{champion:29}} {{champion:96}} who have no viable form of self peel or stealth or great amounts of spammable mobility. Twitch has his stealth I guess but once he&#039;s out of it or someone jumps his ass he wont be going stealth anymore, he&#039;ll just pop.\n\nI could care less if everything else about vayne stayed the same, so long as that condemn is reworked. She has so many tools to be an asshole in a 1v1, a mini tristana ult on a basic ability isnt something she needs.\n\nThats my http://jbssa.com/images/our-business/beef/cutout-beef.jpg","replies":[{"poster":"JoeMG","date":"2016-12-12T16:14:42.378+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was just thinking last night they could at least make condemn a skillshot.

Also, then we have to determine if it can hit minions or not, and of course we would have to determine the projectiles speed.\n\nThe stun part itself already is basically a skill-shot in and of itself, so adding another on top of that, might be overcomplicating things.\nAll that said, personally I think they should outright remove condemn and give her something different in its place.
