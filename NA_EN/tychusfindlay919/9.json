When they created the Juggernaut as a class, they had everything in mind, and did the itemization accordingly, but they didn't consider existing tank items, especially because they are very old and are thus too much \"generic\". So people started doing things Riot wasn't expecting, things they shouldn't. They failed because it was the first time, and with the time they slowly tried to fix these mistakes, even though this led to other mistakes because they still needed to do patchly balancing.\n\n> there was no issue with tanks building dead mans plate on occation, but the item is and should still remain a fighter item first and foremost.\n\nMaybe they don't like it as a fighter item. Every tanky item with cc is already a tank item, so maybe they thought is would be better to make it a rule and shifting Deadman's to a tank item. The last patch did this: it completely removed the dps \"potential\" of the Deadman's, and made it a \"one hit once in a while\" item. Also they shifted all this power into the cc, the slow.\n\n> its the same they did with cleaver by making it heavily ad focused and nerfing its health with the marksmen update, even though the item wasnt fucking meant for adc to be built or used, and designed as a core item for juggs.\n> \n> because for some reaosn they always tunnel vision when it comes to item changes.\n> \n> steraks bought by adc and assassins a problem? nerf the item without compensating juggs.\n> \n> titanic hydra bought by skirmishers? nerf the item then change the skirmisher to not scale with it anymore and dont revert the change.\n\nAll of this still falls under the category \"temporal solutions until I figure out what to do\". I'm not a professional, I don't know how to balance things properly, so I can't say if they're doing right or wrong. But they still must follow some guide lines, and this also means they are bound to them. Maybe they can't do everything we ask because for them it's not  so simple.\n\n> and theyre showing that by nerfing health on basically every source of health in the game, including juggernaut items?\n\nNone of the juggernaut items (which looks like are the class meant to stack health) has nerfed health on the pbe. If they did it during the past year, it doesn't matter: they were just band aids. Now they are marking tanky itemization, so it's now that you have to consider. And none of the items a juggernaut should build has health nerfed.\n\n> thats my entire point. you cant just balance tank and jugg itemization in a vacuum. juggernauts are expected to build items like wamogs or occationally randuins to complement their builds.\n> \n> and if you make these items less viable for them, then at least leave juggs with alternatives and dont just remove options.\n\nThe options are there. They are undertuned because other classes abused them, and because juggernauts abused tank items. One step at a time. Now they are taking away the tank items. I'm pretty sure in time we'll see changes to juggernauts to counterbalance the loss of these items.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Big Lincoln","date":"2017-04-07T12:28:40.869+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mallet is shit\n\nCleaver and titanic is almost always one or the other, the only one who builds both isn't even a juggernaut {{champion:58}} \n\nWarmog is worthless \n\nJuggernauts do not abuse items.","replies":[{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2017-04-07T13:19:12.592+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Imo Mundo does...mainly cause Mundo.","replies":[{"poster":"Big Lincoln","date":"2017-04-07T13:20:23.122+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"mundo is just a shit design, we all know this\n\nJuggernauts are intended to build tank items for survivability though","replies":[{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2017-04-07T13:30:52.368+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's true, but it can lead to the issue that juggernauts become more tanky than tanks.

Think they just need to make more juggernaut items then. As per Deadmans idk. I've built it on tanks before but mainly as another armor option when stacking vs an all AD team.

Ironically, Titanic rewards higher attack speed onhit builds (even if you dont stack as much HP, if you're attacking way more you're getting more out of it than a slow hyper-tanky juggernaut like darius or garen or illaoi) as opposed to tanky builds and the same goes for mallet which is probably more core on certain ranged champions as opposed to melee champions.\n\nRanduins right now is pretty much better than deadmans. It has a lot more anti kite, the active is 4 seconds man, that's a LONG ASS time to be slowed. Dead mans also doesn't do much for you since the smallest of CCs saps stacks.","replies":[{"poster":"OyddAWqJ5r","date":"2017-04-09T03:11:21.438+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe I prefer it moreso cuz almost every champ I play benefits a ton from mobility.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"KoKoboto","date":"2017-04-07T15:56:53.758+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I hope they consider juggernauts with these changes, they focused on separating damage from tank items as well as decrease the universality of defenses with items by reducing health and focusing on resistances which is great.
