{"poster":"Tychusfindlay919","date":"2017-04-08T16:59:13.288+0000","title":"@riot this is the time to actually make steraks worth a slot for juggernauts","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":87,"down_votes":6,"body":"Current steraks:\n\nStats\n+400 health\n+25% base attack damage\nPassive\nUNIQUE &ndash; LIFELINE: Grants STERAK&#039;S FURY upon taking 400 - 1800 (based on level) damage within 5 seconds (60 second cooldown).\nUNIQUE &ndash; STERAK&#039;S FURY: Grants increased size, +25% additional base attack damage for 8 seconds, and a rapidly decaying shield based of 30% maximum health for 3 seconds.\nBUILD/COST\n\nJaurim&#039;s Fist item + Long Sword item + Gold 1050\nCost: Gold 2600\n\nPROPOSED CHANGES\n\nKeep Jaurim&#039;s Fist, and add a ruby crystal on top of the long sword. The combine cost stays the same at 1050, and the total cost of the item is now 3000 instead of 2600 gold.\n\nNEW STATS:\n\n+575 health\n+30% base attack damage\nPassive\nUNIQUE - LIFELINE: Grants STERAK&#039;S FURY upon taking 400-1800 (based on level) damage within 5 second (60 second cooldown).\nUNIQUE - STERAK&#039;S FURY: Grants increased size, +20% additional base attack damage while in combat, and a decaying shield (shield decays by 20% each second) for 50% BONUS HP health for 5 seconds.\n\nThe base ad gain stays exactly the same (it&#039;s a little bit more frontloaded so you don&#039;t have to wait for the passive proc to go off for half of it). The cost goes up by 400 gold so steraks is once again a decently expensive item, requiring a good 3000 gold to buy, but now it actually has STATS that JUGGERNAUTS want. It&#039;s a no resistance, high HP item. Its passive now scales off of BONUS HP so ADCs and the like can&#039;t abuse it so hard. Like maw, the AD gain now stays until out of combat (juggernauts are meant for drawn out fights, why do they have a time limit unlike maw users?). The shield still decays but it&#039;s a little bit slower so it doesn&#039;t feel like half of your shield gets wasted even if you aren&#039;t being hard focused.\n\nRATIONALE:\n\nSteraks has been the victim of a consistent water-down policy riot has had for tank and juggernaut items. This change is meant to bring it back as a decent-cost juggernaut item that gives juggernauts everything they want while also taking away some of its aspects that made it abusable by squishy ranged champions. The passive is still unique so you cant stack it with maw (I figured we&#039;ll just keep that in for extra safety), but now it&#039;s an item that illaoi, mordekaiser, darius, garen, etc. can feel GOOD about buying.\n\nAnd, it&#039;s distinct from tank itemization plans on the PBE because it doesn&#039;t give any resistances which a lot of tank items have, but it gives a nice chunk of HP which a lot of tank items lost. This is in keeping with Riot's long-held policy that juggernauts should be heavy HP stackers while tanks should be heavy resistance stackers.\n\nPlease Riot, make this happen if you&#039;re going to stick with the tank itemization changes currently on the PBE.\n\nEDIT\n\nI'm still waiting for a red to respond, I think this change is 100% appropriate for a dead item that shows promise of revival.","replies":[{"poster":"ZT Xperimentor","date":"2017-04-08T17:07:51.029+0000","up_votes":28,"down_votes":5,"body":"*Melee only*","replies":[{"poster":"Tychusfindlay919","date":"2017-04-08T17:08:39.593+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ZT Xperimentor,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=rVeibxpG,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-04-08T17:07:51.029+0000)\n>\n> *Melee only*\n\nI don't think we have to go that far yet, but I'm all for this if that's necessary good sir.","replies":[{"poster":"ZT Xperimentor","date":"2017-04-08T17:13:30.988+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":1,"body":"Remember why it was gutted to begin with? \nMarksmen were abusing it to outlast mages & assassins.
