In other words, if first and third positions changed with each other and the rest of the order stayed the same, it would still be considered a different arrangement. This is important in order to distinguish between permutations and combinations. (Order does not matter for combinations; \"1,2,3\" is the same as \"3,1,2\")\n\nWhat you used is the shorthand for solving permutations. 128!/5!(128-5)! is the same as 128x127x126x125x124. Here's the thing though, when you solve this particular problem as a permutation, rather than a combination then {{champion:266}}, {{champion:103}}, {{champion:22}} , {{champion:12}}, and {{champion:32}} add 120 possibiities to our total instead of just 1.\n\nNow, in order for those results to warrant inclusion instead of defaulting to a combination formula instead, there must me a significant difference between them, right? To that end, I assigned meaning to the presentation order by adding a role to each slot. It doesn't matter which one goes where so long as it's consistent and top, mid, supp, adc, and jg are accounted for.\n\n***\n\n_**TLDR: both of us calculated for permutations, which gives you 5 times as many results as combinations do, so I made those extra results meaningful by accounting for role distribution.**_","replies":[{"poster":"4thHorsman","date":"2016-01-10T03:01:54.698+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=IronwallJackson,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=4sr1iVuw,comment-id=000300000000,timestamp=2016-01-09T22:58:21.288+0000)\n>\n> What you used is the shorthand for solving permutations. 128!/5!(128-5)! is the same as 128x127x126x125x124.
