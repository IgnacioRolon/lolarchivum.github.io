Draft or blind or aram.\r\nI just get this error then my game loads up and I have no masteries.","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-05-19T22:13:47.346+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have seen something like this similar in the past, but it usually involved two mastery pages being named exactly the same or some weird special character used in the mastery page.  From looking at your pages, I only see one page that has a special character, which is your def/tank/sup bondofstone page.  Can you try deleting the slashes just to see if this has any kind of impact on being able to save your pages at all?\n\nReply back and let me know!","replies":[{"poster":"Enezai","date":"2016-05-20T00:10:25.378+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well i took them out just in case but today when I loaded league it worked fine.\nI feel like something glitched with that page that I tried to make on the fly because even today it was still empty even though I'd tried to fill it like 5 times yesterday.\nWell as it is it's all ok now so that's that???","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-05-20T22:51:45.167+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It seems like!
