I open in up and get a ward skin, two champ skins, and warwick. For a whopping total of 90 BE. Isnt there supposed to be a minimum amount or does riot just like to fuck its players over ?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-12T22:14:52.396+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"At level 10, it looks like you got the Sherwood Forest Ashe skin shard, 500 Orange Essence to craft it, the Recon Drone ward shard, and the Warwick shard. Warwick does only give 90 BE when disenchanted, but the main reward for that level is the Sherwood Ashe shard I believe. \n\nTBH, this actually lines up with the [**level rewards Cactopus posted 2 days ago**](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/hAaYMrEs-leveling-and-rewards-early-impressions-and-adjustments)!","replies":[{"poster":"TribunalRunByDog","date":"2017-11-12T22:38:03.005+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"How come it is so difficult to earn BE?  The grind is so boring now, and it's SOO obvious that the plot behind the update is to get players to spend real-world-$$$'s in order to progress and unlock new champions.\n\nThrow in some skin shards, free capsules, make it look like we're being rewarded, when what good are rewards when you have to grind for over twice as long as it used to be, just to unlock a champ you like?  It's a money grab and it's unfortunate this game has come to this.","replies":[]}]}]}
