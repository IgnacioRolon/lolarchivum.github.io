Need some help =/","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So with the recent patch for some odd reason i've been having framerate issues (not to mention ping issues as well my ping rose up with 10 going from 42 to 52) anyways from what I have seen every 1 to 2 minutes and rarely 3 I have a huge fps drop that goes from 30 FPS straight down to 2 . I have even had instances where it goes down to 1 . I tried pretty much everything . Updating drivers , defragging my drives , lowering settings to minimum and turning off all features , lowering resolution (I tried every single one of the resolutions and nothing changed) , turning off all the fancy windows 7 functions (basicly looks like the old windows XP) , turning everything except my antivirus program off (I tried without the program aswell nothing changed) . After all that I saw no diffrence . I've had this pc for a couple of months now and up until now the max framerate issues I had were when I got it and AMD gave me 20 months old drivers but thats about it after updating the drivers everything ran smoothly with rare instances of 20 FPS in huge teamfights . \r\nMy current PC components are :\r\nCPU:Intel Pentium 4 3.00 GHz\r\nRAM:2x2GB RAM Sticks 3.5 usable duo to windows being 32 bit\r\nGPU:AMD Sapphire HD 6670\r\nPSU:450 Watt (can't recall the mark)\r\nOS:Windows 7 Ultimate Service Pack 1\r\n(Note: I know my CPU is ancient and it needs to be changed but I am really tight on money the past 2 months so I haven't had the chance to change it .)","replies":[{"poster":"Bjergsen student","date":"2017-04-17T17:02:51.583+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm having the exact same issue! I had this problem like 3 weeks ago and it got fixed somehow when I changed my graphics driver version. This time however I tried doing the same thing all over again but it didn't help. I guess it's a client issue. Let me know when you fix it please.","replies":[{"poster":"Safa","date":"2017-04-22T15:19:10.321+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was able to fix my FPS after completely uninstalling and reinstalling my drivers . But duo to the current drivers being somewhat wonky (being unable to watch youtube videos even at 480p) . I downgraded to a previous version and everything fixed itself out . Also I kind of removed a lot of stuff (changed my antivirus removed all files I didn't need in Disk C etc) Also with the recent patch with Rakan and Xayah pretty much everything smoothed itself out (not to mention my ping going from 62 to the glorious 42 :P) . I hope you can fix your issue .","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-04-11T18:09:20.152+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're mentionoing ping issues as well, so I'm curious if what you're seeing are actually network problems like packet loss.
