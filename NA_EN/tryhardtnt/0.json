If you hadn't done that, you wouldn't be banned. Your very inability to grasp that your behavior - which is all that's considered when your account is reported - broke the rules is the reason you aren't being given any more opportunities to break the rules. And this is after a 14-day suspension just a couple months ago, where you were warned very clearly that the slightest misstep would cost you your account.\n\nAnd even after that dire warning you're _still_ clogging up matches with bile and then acting self-righteous and innocent while blaming everyone but yourself for your behavior.\n\nPermaban deserved.","replies":[{"poster":"TryHardTNT","date":"2019-07-02T07:35:25.908+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"You should read what i have replied to other simmilar comments and me calling my teammates (trolls) i still stand by because by using their own logic they would be trolls \nif you are doing bad they gonna call you a troll you start doing better than them you are still a troll lux was the only person from said match that was actually looking at it from my point of view \nI never flamed directly or to their face as you can read what i said before","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-07-02T07:54:04.718+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=TryHardTNT,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=Fj7k6NPp,comment-id=00050000,timestamp=2019-07-02T07:35:25.908+0000)\n>\n> You should read what i have replied to other simmilar comments and me calling my teammates (trolls) i still stand by because by using their own logic they would be trolls \n> if you are doing bad they gonna call you a troll you start doing better than them you are still a troll lux was the only person from said match that was actually looking at it from my point of view \n> I never flamed directly or to their face as you can read what i said before\n\nIt doesn't matter whether it's true. It matters whether it's polite and conducive to a good match. If a teammate is trolling, spending the entire match screaming that they're a troll is harassment and doesn't help matters, in the same way that e.g. constantly announcing a teammate's poor score in chat is harassment and doesn't help matters even if it's factual. If you think a teammate is griefing, report them after the match.\n\nYour punishment doesn't take into account what other people called you. Can you imagine if it did? Toxic players would get away with terrible behavior just because a teammate was even worse, and the least positive player on a team would be in danger of punishment just because everyone else's behavior was better. That would be kind of ridiculous, don't you think? That's why players are judged on whether their own behavior broke the rules.\n\nYou spent the entire match flaming and arguing, going on about how you were going to report your teammates, calling someone a \"toxic dickhead,\" etc.\n\nI'm not surprised in the slightest that you can't understand why you're banned. _That's why you're banned._ Riot has had enough of your behavior.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"FioraWillCarry","date":"2019-07-02T12:54:59.742+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=KFCeytron,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=Fj7k6NPp,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2019-07-02T06:56:29.114+0000)\n>\n> Permaban deserved.\n\nStrongly disagree.

Its really hard to put this ban into debate if riot put it in their stand point and point out your wrong doings and doesn't look into the whole situation. i still stand with my vote on No. Because it happens to everyone and they do talk about it. Its riot not looking into the whole match on who is saying this or that, but the person who got reported. it sucks that they don't have another opinion or a stand point on these reports.","replies":[{"poster":"TryHardTNT","date":"2019-07-03T11:38:43.885+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Thank you for saying that its almost like if they gave you the enitire chat log that a certain thing called *context* would also be a part of the debate","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Telephone Booth","date":"2019-07-02T23:57:23.838+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Socialize less.
