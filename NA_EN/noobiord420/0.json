Didn&#039;t help your rammus jungle invade level 1? Didn&#039;t try to 2v4 with your jungler to defend the early invade? \n\nIts funny how people who have very little understanding of the game can trash talk you, but when you get irritated and respond with something less than friendly thats grounds for a mute. This problem is compounded when the team has no idea what they're talking about either, and turn on you as well. So you have 4 people trash talking you, and of course being irritated you respond to all of them. But guess what! you're in the wrong here, majority wins\n\nIn a nutshell, it doesn&#039;t matter who&#039;s right, who&#039;s wrong, or even who says what! It just matters who the team dislikes, cause they are the majority, and riot agrees with the majority.\n\n(keep in mind the majority of league players are stuck in silver){{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"DrCyanide","date":"2017-10-01T05:43:56.995+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> In a nutshell, it doesn't matter who's right, who's wrong, or even who says what!

It takes one report to get the Instant Feedback System to check out someone's logs, which means it doesn't matter if you're being reported by a 4 man premade or if that odd man out is reporting your premade. No punishment happens unless the IFS verifies the report based on what was said.\n\nThere is a standard of common decency that's expected though. Too many people who post on these boards don't seem to know what trash talking is, but want to use it as an excuse to get out of their punishment anyway.","replies":[{"poster":"NoobIord420","date":"2017-10-01T06:04:38.009+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it does matter, i reported the people who trash talked me basically saying the same things i said but maybe with half the frequency.

All you'll get are people defending their beloved company.\nI'll give you the real reason people get banned.\nBans are more frequently awarded of recent. Ritos loot thingy made the company take a hit in sales because people bought less skins.\nNow you get keys for honour. And well if you ban players they dont get keys and spend to buy them.\nKeys cost less than entire skins so people buy them more readily and the people who wouldn't spend for skins spend for keys as well since they're cheap.\nSo its all a business strategy really. You don't get voice chat for the same reason as well.\nQuit thinking Rito cares about the community. They care about neither the toxic nor sober parties.\nAnd don't be upset. It's the same with every other game or anything really.\nJust chill and play.","replies":[]},{"poster":"General Esdeath ","date":"2017-10-01T18:14:28.042+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"stuck\"\n\nSome people just don't play a lot.
