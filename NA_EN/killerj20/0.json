Specifically, connection to our chat and game servers seems to get cut off and that can happen with a weak or problematic connection.  I suggest going through each step of the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to help get you back in game and the client for good.
