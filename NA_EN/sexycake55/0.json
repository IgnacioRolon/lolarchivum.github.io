I do not know what is making it stay open, this does not happen all the time but it happens more often than one would think. Would this cause problems with how league runs and how could I prevent it from happening in the future.

It just minimizes the client, as it does when the game switches into the loading screen but the loading screen does not load up, I am just staring at my desktop waiting for it to open but it does not open, in my task manager I do not think that it shows the loading screen application, it only shows two sorta background applications that would be the client and the patcher. It does not give me an error or anything of the sort at all. The loading screen does not come up at all either. In the other discussion board that I had reported the application of the loading screen and the game itself (summoners rift), I had said that when I close League, after this occurs it is scanning like there is a problem but it stays constantly at 0 files scanned when I had left it there for like 5-10 minutes.. I am running League off of a external hard drive and what I ended up doing is just disconnecting the external hard drive then plugging it in again after this scan would not do anything, after doing this it just said launch, instead of it saying that it needed to scan. I am not sure if the lockfile staying open in the League folder even after I have closed League has to do with me not being able to load into the different application that is opened after champ select. What I did today, this morning when this occurred, I deleted the lockfle, because I did not see that it was needed since league was not open (since my computer was turned off) and then opened League as I would every day. After doing a champion select, the problem occurred to where the application where it would show the loading screen did not open. So I am not sure if these are two different things or if they are related, so that is why I had said that the loading screen would not load up on my screen. Hope that this information was what you are asking for. Thank you! (Oh and just a side comment, me not loading into the loading screen and game after that does not always occur, but it occurs frequently)","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-13T16:34:06.775+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The lockfile shouldn't be causing any issues, so it's fine to leave that alone for now.  The loading issue not appearing might not have anything to do at all with your settings or applications, and may actually be an issue with your network.  The loading screen isn't appearing because you can't establish a connection to your game server, so it lays in a dormant state.  Go through each step in our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to tune up your connection.

Can you go into more detail about what you mean by not running?  For example, it sounds like you can get into the client if you get far enough to finish champion select.  Are you receiving any errors, or does the loading screen come up at all?  Is it just a black screen?  There could be a variety of reasons, so I'd like to rule out some possibilities!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sexycake55","date":"2016-08-13T15:02:19.952+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think this is is related to the problem that I reported here \nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/ZF92B01s-game-will-not-load-in-after-champ-select\nMy league is not opening the application that is the game when I did a custom game to see if I could load into the game.
