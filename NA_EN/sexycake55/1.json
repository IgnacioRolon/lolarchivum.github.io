I cannot see the loading screen for champions, I will not even load in when the teams load into the rift.. It makes me have to restart league and have to relogin and it has to scan for a minute and comes up with nothing. This has occured multiple times at times but then other times it does not occur at all. It occurs sometimes when I want to play ranked even though it did not happen when I played a normals. I have no idea what causes it to happen or why it will happen. My client is still open because I can open it and it says I am in a game, but it will not load the window that has the load in or even the game on the Rift. This has happened twice when I play ranked and I am now in a 10 minute waiting queue because of it. The last game it happened in I loaded in the game right when my team voted for a remake. I saw the vote happen and it did not stop. It happens other times in normal games and it is just an annoyance and I do not know why it happens. Any ideas of how I could fix it would be awesome.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-10T22:58:21.856+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What error messages do you see when this happens? Also, you mentioned:\n\n> it has to scan for a minute and comes up with nothing.\n\nWhat had to scan? Was the client looking for corrupted files or did you get a message saying something else?

Just a background right there because I will talk about that when talking about the scan. When this occurs, no error message pops up for me, I do not understand because in the extra programs in the bottom right corner of windows I can see the client lists as \"RIOT\" as an Icon, but the application that the game goes through does not pop up at all. About the scan, it shows 0 files scanned as a constant and it does not change. It does not change at all for at least the 5-10 minutes that I left it there as my friends were in a game waiting. What I ended up doing was closing league through the task manager and disconnect my external hard drive, reconnect it, then run league and it does not need to scan for anything. I do not know what would cause this and it has only occurred within the last couple weeks. Thank you for helping {{champion:72}} :D :D","replies":[]}]}]}
