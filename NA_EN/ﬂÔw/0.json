Even though it was borderless, I was in a fullscreen mode and it was very easy to command tab (Alt-Tab). Post-patch 7.9, when I started a game, my League in-game client is actually borderless mode (I can see what I have running in the background). So whenever I click my mouse outside the league client, it brings me to chrome or what ever thing I have open in the background (which is very frustrating when I'm in a game). Playing in full screen now makes my computer fan go crazy and alt tabbing takes like 10+ seconds. How would I be able to get back the Pre 7.9 borderless mode. P.S. windowed mode makes my fps drop below 30. How can I fix this?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-05T02:33:12.152+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Running League in borderless will leave you open to clicking outside of the window if the resolutions aren't perfectly matched. It sounds like some of the background is still showing if you're able to accidentally click outside of League's window. I'd recommend double checking your resolutions to make sure that League's matches your pc's size. \n\nYour FPS drops could most likely be fixed by trying out another new feature we introduced into the new client, low-spec mode. You can turn that one through the client settings, so give that a go in a practice match and let me know how it helps.","replies":[{"poster":"ﬂÔw","date":"2017-05-05T20:08:40.861+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I will try this thank you","replies":[{"poster":"ﬂÔw","date":"2017-05-05T20:17:28.979+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So i tried it but it didn't work.
