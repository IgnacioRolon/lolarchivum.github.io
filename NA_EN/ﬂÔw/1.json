I recently played an URF game and got riven. That was when I realized the skin that I had bought was no longer available. I don't know if this is just happened to me or if anyone else is having this issue. It would be cool to own the skin that I spent RP on : P.         {{champion:92}}","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-13T03:22:53.965+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmmm I do see that you still own Championship Riven 2016, so I'm wondering if you were possibly looking at the other version of Championship Riven which is locked for your account.

For some reason when I was in champion select the 2016 version didn't pop up for me. Guess the client needed a reboot lol. But yes I still have it (weird how they have 2 different versions). Thanks again","replies":[]}]}]}
