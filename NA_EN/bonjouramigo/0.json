I cannot alt tab out of the client without my client going unresponsive and all white screened, this isn't only happening to me but it was happening to friends of mine as well. Whenever the client goes unresponsive on top of that, if I try ended the process open the client again it says 'We have restored you to an older patch' and my login details wouldn't work. This would lead to me dodging about 3/5 games I play almost every day. A lot of my time has now been spent in low-priority queue and it's super frustrating for me to be put in that queue and causing my teams to lose LP, as the client recognises me as being connected so my teams cannot remake.\r\n\r\nMost the thread's comments involve other mac users going 'Yeah but it doesn't happen to me' maybe I'm part of the minority who's been having this issue but even the minority should be looked after. Please Riot find a fix for this..","replies":[{"poster":"Saphy","date":"2017-06-18T18:41:56.053+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"FPS Lag. Starts at 60 FPS and as game progresses it steadily drops down to (NOT JOKING) 1-2 FPS. Only way to fix it is to restart the entire game/client. \n\nAlso alt tab doesn't work. After the game ends, I cannot close the game and have to force quit each time. \n\nThis happens on both my PC and my Mac. \n\nMy PC is a pile of shit but my Mac is brand new high end and shouldn't have any issues.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-23T20:42:47.854+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This error you're describing sounds like the patch mis-match issue that's we've been investigating, and not specifically the mac issues that's been reported.  In this case,  My suggestion in this case would be to download the [hextech repair tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367) and perform a Force Repatch to make sure your client gets to the most up to date version.  Let me know if this works, then share it with your friends!","replies":[{"poster":"BonjourAmigo","date":"2017-06-01T08:19:11.061+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there I have a brand new mac, the patch issue has been solved but my fps are ridiculously unstable. There's always huge memory leaks with the client there's always two league of legends processes running whenever I have one client open, both using over 100% cpu usage, it actually kills the FPS. On top of that there are certain skins that the client constantly is unable to select, keeps saying something along the line of we've failed to set your skin or so","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Vegetables soup","date":"2017-05-23T22:01:08.032+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So that's now two week that I am in discussion with Riot support about MAC issue I got and most importantly FPS issues.\n\nToday I got told League of Legends does not support anymore mac from 2007 or older. Wich of course did not fix my issue as my mac is a high end late 2013 Mac book pro Retina. But maybe you have one of those mac ?","replies":[]}]}
