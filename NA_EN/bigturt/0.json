But if you got placed in bronze 3 with 8 win 2 lost you should have been playing mostly with people at that level mmr. It might depend on what mmr you played too. Like if you’re playing on bronze 1 mmr but went 5-5 it’s harder than getting 8-2 on a bronze 4-5 mmr. However if you don’t belong there you’ll climb out easily.","replies":[]}]}
