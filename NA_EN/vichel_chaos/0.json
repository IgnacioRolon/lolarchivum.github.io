I&#039;m platinum level, so not the best but many of the basics should still apply. Will attempt to push for diamond in summer tho! (Engineer life, don&#039;t have much time for this atm...) Also, english is not my first language, so apologies for any spelling or grammar mistake I can make.\r\n\r\n1-This is the most important thing I&#039;d like to emphasize as a jungler. If you, as a laner, are far behind, it is a terrible idea to gank. If the gank goes badly, the enemy laner and jungler may 2v2 us at a countergank, or sometimes even worse, 1v2 us. He might not even be too far ahead, but if the enemy has reached a powerspike while you have not, that situation may arise. If I see that one successful gank might change the way the lane is going completely, I might give it a shot, but if you need multiple successful ganks to get back into track, my time is better spent somewhere else. So, if the enemy Fiora is 4-0, I&#039;m afraid you might be on your own for this one, just hug your tower and ward for dives. If the situation comes when you are constantly dove 1v1 and killed, the only thing left for me to do before helping you is to make that situation happen in reverse in some other lane or get big enough so that my help actually gives us a chance against the enemy monster, so I will help but it might take some time.\r\n\r\n2-I need to farm. I cannot be constantly ganking around, or I will fall behind in levels and items. If I see or predict a good gank oportunity, I will try to path in a way that naturally leads me there. If the situation is extremely favorable and a great opportunity, I might skip some camps for it, but I will not walk from blue side krugs to gank top lane ignoring 3 camps on the way just because your laner is pushed. It is very important for a jungler to keep the jungle clear to be relevant.\r\n\r\n3-It is not my job to win lane for you, or gank the same number of times that the opposing jungler ganked. If you lose your lane, it is not my fault. If I can help you win it I will, or help in a slight losing situation, but it is not something I have to do. I am as interested in winning as you are, but you have to accept that sometimes the path to victory is not you carrying. By the way, disrespecting me in any way probably makes me automatically assume that you are not in the mindset to be a useful asset to the team, so keep that in mind when asking for a gank.\r\n\r\n4-Depending on the situation, a gank is simply not possible. If I am a level 4 Shyvana, well, unless the enemy does something extremely stupid and you have a lot of CC, it will be hard for me to do anything for you. I will emphasize ganking if the situation is good for it, but it might not be the case. Maybe I want to farm, maybe counterjungle, secure a buff, maybe another lane is better prepared. Also, sometimes the gank opportunities occur when I am on the other side of the map and I will not get there on time. \r\n\r\n5-Now, if the enemy laner tilts, believe me that I will set up that tent in your bushes. We get a kill top lane at level 3? I might as well sit in the bushes until he tps back and kill him again. With some cooperation it is quite easy to get that all chat warrior to leave the game. If he types something along the likes of &quot;noob cant 1v1&quot;, then be sure that he will never get a chance to 1v1 you until you get fed enough to stomp 3 of their team if they come to help him. Also, in general I will be happy to set up dives and lane ganks with you, but let me first make sure that the opposing jungler will not interfere. We can take the risk, but sometimes dives fail, it is a normal thing that happens and it is important to not to get tilted because of it.\r\n\r\n6-Zuck Fhonyas Morgana midlane with ultimate. I&#039;m not ganking that. Just enjoy your farm lane.\r\n\r\nAnyways, that is it for now. It is a lot to take in, but I hope that some people understand why their jungler might not gank them even if the situation seems appropiate for a gank. To be honest, I get mostly flamed it plat 5 and 4. Below that, people do not have that &quot;I&#039;m the best and only I can carry this nob team&quot; attitude, and above that, a guy who fed 4 solo kills undestands that ganking him will get us both killed, but there are always exceptions. This was sort of a rant, but it gets to be tiring to put up with this a lot of games, so I hope that some more people might understand a bit about what the jungler has on his mind.

A lot of people still wont agree even reading this because they'll feel entitled to being babysat, or have the mentality that everyone is shit and theyre the win condition on their team, partially bc that's whats solo queue sometimes is\n\nI'd also add that :\n\n1. if their build is shit I'm not ganking for them. IE - ADC chose to rush something stupid like finish boots first vs the enemy who has a BF sword, there's no way we'll ever win that trade or even have the damage to kill them so coming to gank is a waste of time. Also seeing that if they dont know how to build properly, getting them a kill and \"ahead\" doesnt mean they'll know how to carry even with a lead\n\n2. If I see they have shitty back timings I'll also less likely gank for them such as seeing someone with full HP go back without shoving the lane because they can afford an item they want, or if they just consistently blow all their mana to waveclear then base to recharge mana... It basically throws the lead I give them away when they dont snowball with more exp and gold by laning properly\n\n3. If they dont at least try to get some vision control it's also a waste of time to come. I can head to go gank and they'll back off everytime when they have full vision, and it's a risk for me to come gank going in blind when I could get counterganked. I can put down some wards on my pass through, but most of the time my wards are better used in the deep jungle where laners arent always going to track their jungler. My job is better used to shut down their jungler rather than get you back to even.

I know that I strugge with predicitng when a gank could work and such, and I just want to get better\n\nI'm not the best jungler around. But I can offer some basic tips:\n\n-First of all, do not neglect farm. If you find yourself typically falling behind in levels, even if your ganks work out, or if you feel useless sometimes and feel that you don't have an impact, that is probably the reason why. It also can keep you in the game if all lanes lose or your ganks fail. Try to fit ganking into your jungle clears rather than the other way around, but be flexible.\n\n-If a lane is overextended it is usually pretty succesfull to gank it even if they have wards. They might see you coming but their tower might be far out of reach.\n\n-When ganking mid lane, go behind the bush unless you need the few seconds of time that going through the bush gives you. Try to look at your incoming wave to see where minions will be to spot you as you are coming in. This wave trick is also pretty useful to know if enemy minion will spot you when you are stealing enemy krugs.\n\n-Do not use your gapcloser to initiate a gank unless it is absolutely necessary. If you can walk up to them (and maybe tag them with red) you can use your gapcloser if they blow a summoner. Path toward their escape route, not their position. On many champions, esperically ranged ones without CC, tagging them with red will be your biggest priority in a gank.\n\n-When invading, watch your laners to see who has lane priority. This basically means who will arrive first in the event that you get spotted and fitght their jungler. If your laner is pushed against his turret with a huge wave or cannot follow the enemy laner because he might die to him, then either forget the invade or have extreme caution, an escape route and be ready to book it if they move toward you.\n\n-When ganking, especially the side lanes, keep other lanes in mind. This is especially important when mid roams to follow a gank. You don't want to overcommit when their mid laner is moving toward you.\n\n-The best moment to gank is when you have red buff. Use this window. Especially the level 3 gank.\n\n-When predicting when to gank, keep in mind who pushes harder, the combined damage and cc that both you and your laners have and their escape mechanisms. Include summoner spells in this. The most basic rule of thumb that I can give you is that ganking an overextended lane with red buff is very powerful. For example, if you are against a mordekaiser toplane who will push, you can try to path such that you gank him with red buff. Say he beginning of the game, you clear bot buff then wolves into top buff, that gives you level 3 and red buff while in a good position to move toplane if he is pushed. One last thing that you have to keep in mind, albeit a bit more advanced, is laner power levels and where the enemy jungler is. Basically, try to make sure you can win a 2v2 (and of course be sure that you can win 2v1) if you don't have vision coverage or info on when and where the enemy jungler appeared last.\n\n-After a successful kill, if enemy can't get back to lane fast or you an get the minions under turret before the gets back to lane, push with your laner. If he is any decent he will appreciate the help. The power of a gank is not only the kill gold and exp, but also the denial of minions to the tower. The best thing is that if you hard shove, the lane will reset and go back to mid position so the laner has nothing to complain about. Take maybe one or two minions as tax if you didn't take the kill, you judge how much you can take depending on if your laner is already far ahead, you are behind or who can carry harder. Don't take the cannon. Also, if you laner is setting up a huge freeze, don't break it, but in general you want to get the minion wave under the opposing tower. This boost of exp you get will also compensate the lack of farm you are giving up by ganking.\n\n-Do not neglect farm. I can't stress this enough. Even if your gnaks fail, or a lane feeds, keeping up in levels and gold is vital to keeping relevant. For example, if in the above situation your gank top fails for whatever reason, you can clear scuttle, gromp, chickens and that will leave you in a position to either gank mid or bot or head to krugs if both are not in position to gank. You can also use this opportunity to ward enemy camps.\n\n-Speaking of warding, you can keep track of the enemy jungle by placing intelligent wards. I recommend next to the chickens. You should know where the enemy jungler starts depending on who gets late to lane, so you hsould know when those buffs respawn, so it is not a imperative to keep track of them compared to their chicken camp. This is a place they will mve through many times, so you can see their direction, what buffs they carry and if the camp is up or not, which will give you a lot of leeway to dedice their intentions. Other good locations are in the entrance and exit to their jungle that lead to scuttle or their blue buff.\n\nHope it helps!","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Cynikul","date":"2018-04-13T12:35:23.063+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Amen","replies":[]},{"poster":"GayFluffyUnicorn","date":"2018-04-13T15:38:02.838+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":9,"body":"\"I need to farm\" mistake number one and why so many bad junglers are annoying the shit out of especially solo laners.\nNo you do not need to farm.

I myself like to gank top level 3 after buffs and if we get a kill sit in the bushes and wait for the return kill, my guilty pleasure. I dont understand why you wouldn't get ganked with a gank heavy junger, especially if you are even slightly ahead for some easy kills. Playing off the winning lane is one of the mst important things as a jungler. It also might be styles. I personally like to gank top lane more than other lanes, maybe because I'm a jungler/toplaner (one of the few Aatrox mains who played him since release btw, no one expects you to turn against a gank and 2v1 their asses when you get level 6) and know the matchups and champions pretty well, but that's just me. I don't know, maybe if you fight against a Gnar without jungle ganks with a bad matchup your best option is to sit back and try to just not feed him, not much more I can say. \n\nWell, I've got a possible explanation, but you are not going to like it. I don't like it either. Take into consideration that lately top lane is majorly messed up carrywise. Let me explain myself. There are still some junglers who, if the situation is right, will gank toplane. But recently... Lets say I can get the vast majority of toplanes massively ahead but if the botlane loses even by a little bit they have much more impact. And it is frustrating. Lately we are very pressed to focus bot lane because with adcs spiking pretty fast and supports having such impact, it feels much more rewarding to get them ahead. Not exactly that, more that it feels very underwhelming to get topalners ahead lately. Notable exceptions to this are split push heavy champs, and even in that situation it is still better to get bot lane ahead even if only by a little. I mean, sure I can gank for Malphite/Maokai/Ornn, but if their bot lane wins then we will be in deep trouble. There was this statistic running around which Scarra mentioned somewhere (I will look for it) that getting top lane ahead meant a 58% (if I recall correctly, I know it was in the high 50s) win ratio, while getting bot lane ahead was in the low seventies. Meddler also touched on this lack of solo carry potential from solo laners in one of his gameplay thoughts which you can find on dev corner. I still like to gank top heavily because it is more of my comfort zone, but a lot of junglers have shifted their attention to majorly bot lane even if it means neglecting other lanes, just because of this. Some guys just pick some cinderhulk ganker and just become a bot lane gank dispenser, and I can assure you it feels terrible. It is frustrating, but at least RIOT have aknowledged this and seem to be considering steps toward making solo carrying more of a thing again.","replies":[{"poster":"MuffledGarbage","date":"2018-04-14T03:18:48.981+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"tbh, I probably just have bad matchmaking luck \n\nI know we're stuck in this dumb \"better botlane wins\" meta that seriously makes every non-botlane player into a \"support\" for the ADC.
