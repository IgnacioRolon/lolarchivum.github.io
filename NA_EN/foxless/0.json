It stops after minions spawn tho. I get a good 240 fps and 60 ms. I've also tried using V-sync which solves the problem but getting 240 fps is the reason i bought the Graphic's card. \r\n\r\nAny ideas? \r\n~cgryp1","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-05-03T22:20:24.841+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If left uncapped, I know the game can behave very oddly at very high FPS.  However, when you say that you get a good 240 FPS, is it stable at that number?  Or do you leave it uncapped?  Also, is there a specific reason why you wish to keep V-sync disabled?  Enabling V-sync should match League to the power that your monitor has.","replies":[]}]}
