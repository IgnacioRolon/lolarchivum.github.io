Be grateful that you get any kind of refund at all.\n> \n> Let me use this analogy: You go to the store and buy some cutlery, like forks, knives, etc. You need lots of different kinds. Steak knives, butter knives, regular spoons, soup spoons, forks, etc. At first you&#x27;re single and living alone so you only need 1, maybe 2 of each. But if you get married, have kids, start having friends and family over for gatherings, etc, you need a lot more utensils so everyone can eat.\n> \n> Now, suppose that a universal multi-utensil is invented that can transform into any type of eating tool, and it&#x27;s provided to everyone for free. You don&#x27;t need all this cutlery anymore, so you go back to the store where you bought them and attempt to return them. Good luck with that, a store isn&#x27;t gonna refund your used spoons, especially since they&#x27;re now obsolete. So, what about a pawn shop? You may get some money for them but not much, since they&#x27;re used and obsolete because of the new invention.\n> \n> This is basically Runes. We bought them over the years to fulfill our needs as our champion pools grew, but now that the system is going away we don&#x27;t need them anymore. We got our use out of them, and just like silverware there&#x27;s no way we get full return on investment for them. Riot is at least giving us something, even if it&#x27;s only 10% it&#x27;s still better than not getting anything back.\n> \n> You bought runes with no intention of ever getting a refund for them. You accepted that you had to buy them and you were willing to do so. But now, as soon as a refund is announced, everyone goes crazy and expects massive compensation as if it was promised from the beginning, which it never was. You got your use out of them, Riot has no obligation to refund you, so be happy that you&#x27;re getting some compensation at all, and more importantly, an even better system that is now **completely free.**","replies":[{"poster":"Mossy Lungs","date":"2017-09-02T02:45:35.877+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also I want to add this logic is very wonky...

It is not fair. I remember spending a good chunk of my time one season playing hours upon hours just to scrape enough IP to fill my stockpile up so that I could play this game \"properly\". I even remember spending a lot of my hard earned money to buy rune pages so that I could organize and play more efficiently, and during this time that I was burning through my IP on runes, I was spending real hard-earned money on champions, because you couldn't buy runes with RP (thank god for that now that we see how little we are valued) so it pisses me off to think \"hey that IP you used ended up being a waste in the long run, ultimately a bad investment for my future in this game. At least if I spent IP on champions I'd have them forever. And honestly getting back 1500 per rune page is bogus when we spend RP on them, the 4 pages get a skin is bogus as well, you could just give the RP value of the skin we'd receive so at least we could for sure buy something we wanted, because I own all champions and I just know I'm gonna get some pos skin for a champion I don't play, I don't understand what the difference is, it feels like you're thinking is, \"We'll toss them a good priced skin, but it'll be random so that there is a chance it won't be something they wanted and then we can still profit off of them buying the skin they really want\".. which is crap? I've spent over $2,000 on this game... This game holds a lot of value to me, and I don't like that even $1 of that 2,000 total is feeling wasted, it's not fair. I really hate that the time I've spent playing your game, investing in my future in League seems so unimportant to Riot, I really don't understand how it can be that hard to just honor your players, to give back to the people who have made this game what it is?

A Bonus IP  reward per season since account creation. (EX: Players who have been here since Season 2 would get 50k extra IP since its now Season 7). This number could either be flat or exponential .\n\n\n\nUsing 10k IP reward as an example you can either give players a flat amount per season\n\n10 - 1 seasons\n20 - 2 seasons\n30 - 3 seasons\n40 - 4 seasons\n50 k IP for a player that has played 5 seasons \n\nOR\n\nyou can go the mulplicative route\n\n5 - 1 season\n10 -2 seasons\n20 - 3 seasons\n40 - 4 seasons\n80 k IP for a player that has played 5 seasons\n\nThis way long time players would get the absolute most out of this and newer players would only get an extra champ or two. People who have played since Season 1 or Beta would outright have enough IP to get Urfwick.
