I just feel dirty saying \"I'm an x main\" if x is in the meta. If you've seen the Azmodan basketball skin in Zeroes of the Storm there is 1 attack he does where he throws a basketball across the map and it lands with the swish sound you hear when a basketball goes through the net. Thats what I've always imagined them giving Ziggs. Bouncing bomb bounce sounds could sound just like a basketball being dribbled. The W and the E are a bit harder to figure out though.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Standgrounding","date":"2017-02-22T16:10:21.582+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:86}} {{champion:11}} {{champion:59}} {{champion:2}} {{champion:254}} {{champion:122}} {{champion:266}} {{champion:121}} {{champion:18}} {{champion:154}} {{champion:115}} DUNKED","replies":[]}]}
