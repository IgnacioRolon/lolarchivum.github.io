Swain wants the strongest Noxus possible. Darius seems like he more wants\r\nthe country to remain united, he seems like the one that may care for the people the most. of\r\ncourse thats more opinion I suppose. The faceless is a mystery. I cant really say anything on\r\nthem, but if someone think that Darius and Swain don&#039;t approve they may hope the faceless does.\r\n\r\nI thought Katarina would be one of those champions. I thought that she would approve mainly of\r\nDarius, with how she didnt trust Swain. In the update Im not entirely sure. Swain&#039;s comments\r\nseem to hint she still doesnt like him, but her bio kinda reminded me of the &quot;family last&quot; \r\nattitude of Swain.\r\n\r\nI immagine that the Black Rose is probably linked to the faceless. Im fairly sure most would\r\nagree. {{champion:7}} \r\n\r\nDarius is the odd man out. Which is sad, since I find him the most interesting of the three.\r\nSwain may have brought him on because he is not super political and would probably agree with\r\nSwain in most situations because of their history. Even when it&#039;s hinted that Darius disagrees\r\nin the principals of strength he did not speak up. I kinda am looking forward to see if he\r\nwill do more things for the empire, trying to change how Noxus is, or if he will stay a warrior.\r\nIf the faceless will attempt to manipulate Darius. If Swain will just try to use Darius for his\r\nvote. If Darius will get fed up with it and who will stand by him.\r\n\r\nI started thinking about this when it was said that Darius would be expected to deal with Swain,\r\nand avenge Darkwill. Maybe im also thinking this way because of things like the factions of\r\nFreljord, but Noxus is a big place that keeps getting bigger. I guess this is mostly just\r\ncuriosity of how people think Darius will become in this role. Also to see if I missed something.","replies":[{"poster":"Wrathof300","date":"2018-02-14T04:57:06.916+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think Darius is the same unpolitical warrior most would have assumed him to be in the old lore.\nWhen he remains silent in the Principles of Strength, its not because he is afraid to voice his opinion or have it challenged, rather it shows that he understands how the Trifarix works, and how Swain and the Faceless operate, his vote would go unanswered if the other 2 strongly agree on something already, so he doesn't bother.\nI believe the reason Swain chose Darius, is because he knows he will not be easily manipulated.\n_\"You're the only man I know who believes his own words.

I&#x27;m just hoping to see him do some things politically.\n\nHonestly, I wouldn't be surprised if his personal policy deals with war in general.\n\nFor example, I feel like Guile deals more with nobles and economics\nVision deals with main politics and outward image as well as dealings with foreigners\nAnd Power deals with overall war efforts.  What do the troops need? Where do they go? Does Vision see worth in what I plan to do about this? Does Guile think there's an actual bettwer way to go about this?\n\nEither way, my soldiers are mine. I use them as I see fit.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Scathlocke","date":"2018-02-14T23:35:48.625+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahh, and that's the beauty of the Trifarix - every aspect can be involved in something as apparently simple as \"war\"...\n\n**Vision** tells you where to invade, based on what is good for the future of the empire.\n**Might** crushes the enemy resistance, and raises the Noxian flag over what is left.\n**Guile** assassinates the heir who would otherwise oppose the new rule of Noxus, allowing the next in line to ascend and become a more pliable governor... or, reveals that this entire campaign was a feint to tie up the enemy while the real attack happens a hundred miles away.\n\nDarius' mere presence can be a political statement. If you send him to negotiate a dispute on the fringes of the empire, it implies that the Trifarix has run out of patience and will not let this go on much longer before weapons are drawn. ;-) Or, if the three members are present together and united in their agreement, that means the whole of Noxus wills it.\n\nThe Trifarix (and the Trifarian Legion) are symbolic as much as anything.

A rioter quote!\n\nYou mean, much like how you can just take two of the legionnaires to  any country's doorsteps, and you have control.\n\nI just like how Darius's whole impact in anything  is from the fact that he does talk.  Like, yes, he speaks, but his lack of words make every syllable he say weigh more heavily than Swain's.  Swain will speak to you in an entire conversation.  You know he could have something laced through his words, but they're all...light.  What he says may not fully be what he means literally.  Now you're trying to figure out what is being implied.\n\nDarius doesn't imply. He states. Plainly. he does it to the point where there is no talking around it. What he says goes. Of the three, I rather speak with Swain. At the very least, I can attempt some modicum of reasoning or debate.\n\nDarius won't mince words, and Guile will get my brother to stab me in my own back .\n\nAlso, I can imagine both Swain and Guile sipping tea while Darius has a mug of coffee. Black. No cream, and if you try to add Splenda, you can walk out now.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Scathlocke","date":"2018-02-16T02:50:52.856+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Darius hates Splenda.

It&#x27;s scary just being a person on the same level as Darius and Swain and not knowing who it is.\n\nIt's like a presence of power.\n\nDarius presence is forthright and \"front-loaded\". As in, you can see his strength because it's physical.\n\nFor Darius and the Faceless, it's back-loaded with the idea that they can do a wide arrange of things, but it's based on imagination.\n\nAs in, it's the difference from \"Oh! I can throw out fireballs and make flames.\"  Great! It's scary and powerful in it's own right. It's dangerous and can easily do damage and provoke fear.\n\n\"I can make plants grow REALLY fast and really big!\" Okay...he can garden. Great!  Fire beats a random tulip, right? Well, yeah. But...if he can make plants grow fast and big.  That means he can do things, like...Take a pellet gun full of seeds and plant a forest on your head. Or even better! Take a melon, grow it to 50 times it's normal size and roll it down 8 Mile.\n\nWhat's scary is the fire's immediately threat.  What's intimidating about the plant guy...There's no telling what will happen.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Valaran Nara","date":"2018-02-16T03:22:21.629+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Scathlocke,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=Nn3BNrVp,comment-id=000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2018-02-16T02:50:52.856+0000)\n>\n> Darius hates Splenda.

Although I would find Swain and the Faceless very intimidating (for various reasons), I&#x27;d be SCARED when confronted by Darius.\n\nBrilliant!\nHonestly, after reading the color story, I feel like Darius is one of those men who respond through grunts or single syllable words when addressed by anything.  For example, my dad. \n\"Good morning.\"  -- \"Yeah.\"\n\"Hey!\" -- \"Yeah.\"\n\"You're not serious.\" -- \"Yeah.\"\n\"Where do babies come from?\" -- \"Yea...huh?\"\n\nExcept Darius communicates through grunts. Most of the time if he has nothing explicit to say. Whenever someone says, \"Hi,\" or anything, his response is just \"Grugh.\" And it is his response every time.\n\nDarius walks into the break room and heads to the coffee machine and silently gets his brew.  Swain is already there with a pair of reading glasses on, skimming through a psychology book or maybe an article or encyclopedia over the etymology of birds.  Swain passively says, \"Good morning,\" as Darius enters.  Darius responds with. **\"Rugh.\"**\n\nSwain immediately lowers his book, removes his glasses while still reading, and simply asks, \"I don't suppose you're in the mood to talk about it?\"\n\n\"Grugh\"\n\n\"Heart ache?\"\n\n\"...\"\n\n\"Well, my friend. These thi--\"\n\nDarius *lightly* slams the mug on the table before pulling out his seat and sitting down.\n\n\"Very well.\" Swain immediately goes back to reading.\n\nGuile would be silently chuckling by the ice machine on the other side of the room.  Why? She rigged the machine to instantly mix Splenda into every drink.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
