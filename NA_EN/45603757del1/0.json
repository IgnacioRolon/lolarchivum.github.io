Few months ago I couldn't be bothered so I played on a mac, which felt shitty. Recently I tried to re-install league again and to my surprise after a few tries where it got stuck or crashed or black screened I managed to somehow install the game. In a few attempts I even managed to get a game going. This time after the game was over - first time I couldn't start a new game and close the client. Second time I didn't even end up in the post game lobby, having just a black screen of league that I couldn't close with X and had to resort to ending process tree on windows task manager. To this day I find these issues strange and I can't recall what or when went horribly wrong with getting the game to work on this computer. After the black-screen I decided to uninstall everything there is related to League on my pc and install the game again. Unfortunately now it's just like the same issue I had months ago, where I'm not even able to install the game, as it gets stuck at a certain point in the installment process and I don't know what to do. Is it perhaps possible that a RIOT member checks whatever he has to check through teamviewer to help me get to play the game on my computer again? Because seems like I am unable to do so myself and I'm exhausted from all of this.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-01T20:58:04.529+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Typically if that installer gets stuck around 19% there's a good chance that the installer is being blocked somehow by your OS.

Did everything I could from the thread you presented; on the install it went further this time, but stopped at 56 percent.
