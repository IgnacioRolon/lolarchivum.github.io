It always starts extremely small, and since I stream I have to change it to the exact same resolution I did the time before that or else I'd have to twick it on the streaming program again, every time I quit the client it resets to the small default resolution which is extremely small in 4k monitors, so small that the text is unreadable.\n\nFix it or give me a workaround","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-19T22:03:50.781+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Happy birthday on your new screen!  I know it may suck to hear right now, but 4k is not currently supported with League.  You'll need to reduce your resolution as a workaround for now.  This can be done in-game via the Video options and selecting your resolution.  You may also need to change your screen's resolution as well.  I hope that helps, and despite this news, I hope you had a great birthday!","replies":[{"poster":"Devilman XVI","date":"2017-06-03T08:56:19.121+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"why not just support 4k resolution like dota?","replies":[]}]}]}
