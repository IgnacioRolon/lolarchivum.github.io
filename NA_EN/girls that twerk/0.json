The odd thing is it seems to be around the same time I generally connect to games.  From this I am receiving dodge penalties that sadly I have never actually dodged.\r\n\r\nIn response to this I ran the hextech repair tool, and sadly it hasn't been able to fix this problem. \r\n\r\nSo please anyone that has found a fix for this please let me know!\r\n{{item:3070}} \r\n\r\nTrying to reconnect picture: [Reconnect](http://pasteboard.co/L3BZuuwz0.png)\r\nDodge penalty: [Penalty](http://pasteboard.co/L3Dk1iYRk.png)","replies":[{"poster":"Sonyc","date":"2017-03-19T02:39:11.604+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This just started happening to me today, I have restarted PC and verified my connection has been stable low MS and can continue to watch live streams while this happens to verify my connection isnt dropping.","replies":[{"poster":"Girls That Twerk","date":"2017-03-19T03:13:52.626+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Second this^ I was able to watch the games today no internal connection problems.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-18T23:49:28.432+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You might be having network issues transitioning into champion select, so you're never really able to get into queue properly.  A traceroute wouldn't really help in this case unless you're already in a game, and you're still logged into the client.  I suggest grabbing the [hextech repair tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367) and use it alongside the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to help troubleshoot.  Make sure to go over each step to help with ruling out possibilities and blocks.
