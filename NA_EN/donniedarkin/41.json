The reduced cooldown on Q from a kill is really unnecessary imo, reducing it by autoing is plenty.","replies":[{"poster":"DonnieDarkin","date":"2017-06-11T21:03:26.010+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"exactly","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"RomanorumLegio","date":"2017-06-10T21:33:29.065+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I used to feel the same untill I started playing a lot of support.
