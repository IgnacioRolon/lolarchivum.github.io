How about this, dense one, go back and read the post without you bias and try responding again. Its not a ridiculous demand.  The fact that any CC is basically a hard fuck you to him means that the quicker he can get back to autoing the better his chances there. There are a about a million ways right now to shut him down hard--Randuins and Frozen heart, any CC, good kiting...it doesn't end.  I like how its no problem for that there are already tons of champs that have stupid amounts of moblity and with their items, are nearly inescapable, but wanting aatrox to have a way to increase his movement speed a little is suddenly going to break the game. God damn fucking trolls.  Use brains before you post.  For Gods sakes.
