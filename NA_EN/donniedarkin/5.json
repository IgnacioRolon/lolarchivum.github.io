If Lux can kill someone with her full combo, then she's fulfilled her job. The main weakness of Lux is having 30 seconds of downtime on killing anyone if her full combo can't burst the adc/mage. Otherwise, she just stands there trying to throw out q's and e's hoping that does something (normally, they don't).\nInstead, they should make her passive reduce her ultimate cooldown each time she procs it - it would work as a risk/reward mechanic. They want Lux to be more interactive, so she'll have to put in more work and be a little more vulnerable if she wants to lower the cooldown on her ult.\nIt also means rewarding good {{champion:99}}s with an ultimate cooldown reduction if she lands a full 5-man e>r combo.
