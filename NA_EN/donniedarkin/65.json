Across he board with sample size of millions of players, you have to conclude its rooted in human nature.\n\nIts not complicated--people feel anger or sadness when things are beyond their control.  So much of the game is not in a players control. This is always going to produced emotions. And some people aren&#039;t good at controlling their emotions, and some choose not to.  These are personality issues, and if you think that bans are going to correct behavoior rooted in their years of experiences that developed them into the kind of person they are now, you have no grasp of human nature, how complex people are, or really, reality in general.\n\nRiot created a game, that at its core, will bring out the worst in people due to the nature of the game. That is, individual rank and status based largely on a lot that is out of the player's control. And this isn&#039;t some small thing. A good player who wins some and losses some, could get unlucky with teammates a few matches in a row and cause him to play bad being frustrate for run out of patience, and lose more after that.\n\nRiot doesn&#039;t really care about fixing the issue. If they did, they would come down hard on people who purposely troll and instigate to try to get a reaction out of people.  And they would do something that would lessen the blow of a loss so that players feel less bad when losing due to circumstances out of their control.  \n\nYou aren&#039;t going to change human nature and you certainly won&#039;t correct with bans or chat restrictions. The idea that you think you can impart a real change in a person by such means is beyond laughable","replies":[{"poster":"Ulanopo","date":"2017-06-11T21:20:50.050+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":">Riot created a game, that at its core, will bring out the worst in people due to the nature of the game.\n\nHow is different from, say basketball or Monopoly?

Furthermore, a good basketball or football player will still be known for the individual skill regardless of win/loss of the team. IE Junior Seau of the Chargers or something like that. Even with a bad team, they aren't random so you can probably reason with them and worth together to change how things are going...which you seldom can do in league without everyone getting triggered.This is why MOBAS are ridiculously worse, not to mention the fact that basket ball or other sports have rules that barely ever change, and everyone on the team is the same character--a human being. You won't randomly be match up against something different that is OP, and hes not taking advantage of the latest patch or buff.\n\nThe fact that I have to even explain this to you rather disturbing.","replies":[{"poster":"Ulanopo","date":"2017-06-11T21:46:25.501+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":">The fact that I have to even explain this to you rather disturbing.\n\nMaybe. On the other hand, I find your comments reveal a lack of experience with competitive sports. There are many times where you are faced with a player or tactic you just can't counter.\n\nConsider the example of Dennis Rodman's time with the Bulls. His ability to grab rebounds was so dominant that it took an already superior team to a whole new level. As a Wings fan, I can regale you with stories about how Nick Lidstrom was easily the best defensive player the NHL has ever seen and how he took an otherwise unremarkable team to two Stanley Cups.\n\nI could also talk about how the advent of the West Coast Offense led to the gradual decline of my beloved Michigan Wolverines, but that's as much a nostalgia thing as an example of a changing meta. I can point out how Manti Te'o got wrecked in the NCAA championship game, not because he was distraught over having been catfished, but because he had never faced a powerful north-south back and an offensive line geared to support it. \n\nThe notion of never being subject to an OP combo outside of League is pretty ridiculous, as well. Just the other day, I had a HotS match where the enemy team sported a Medivh + Varian. Talk about a frustrating lack of counterplay!\n\nThis doesn't even begin to touch all the games with a high-randomness component. \n\nMy point is that all the things you ascribe to League exist elsewhere in equal measure.","replies":[]},{"poster":"sheldonbunny","date":"2017-06-11T21:39:41.482+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=DonnieDarkin,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=dH4lg4rM,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2017-06-11T21:27:53.324+0000)\n>\n> The fact that I have to even explain this to you rather disturbing.\n\nYou could have left this bit out. It in no way aided your cause and came off as rude, dismissive, and mean spirited.

Lots of games have a random element or a team component. What makes MOBAs worse in general? What makes League worse than other MOBAs?\n\nI think a better analogy is life, in general. Even if you feel sadness or anger, you're taught at a very early age that the minute you act up on those feelings towards others, you're going to be disciplined. And what's the point of discipline? Is it because we're satists and enjoy punishment? No, it's to correct reaction and teach social norms. By the OPs argument, because it's human nature to lash out when someone takes our toy at age 5, we should just accept that. \n\nNo, we correct and teach because it's what we deem acceptable in community. That's entirely the argument. You could make the argument that it's not Riot's job to correct unacceptable behavior; however, they've taken up that mantle because the alternative is the Wild-West where everything goes.","replies":[]},{"poster":"khorney","date":"2017-06-11T23:03:11.213+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":11,"body":"It's known fact that league is more toxic also riot permabanned people for no reason.
