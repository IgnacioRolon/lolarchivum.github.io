All you've achieved here is to make yourself look terrible in the eyes of others.\n\nI'm not against you here, I think Graves is still a problem.

No.\n\nIf you want somebody to listen to you, you would do best to not make them hate you first. The truth is that in order to get others to accomplish tasks for you, you must treat them with respect. If you behave childishly and bitchily then others will shut you out, ignore you, or downright sabotage you.\n\nOK, example time.\n\nIf we were housemates and you were taller than me. Lets say there's a box of cereal we both like, you keep putting it up on the fridge out of my reach. So morning rolls around and I find that I can't get the cereal, but I need to eat breakfast and get going to work...\n\n...Is it faster to yell at you about it and start an argument, or would it be faster to ask you to please get it for me? Which would be more likely to illicit your help for me and get me out the door to work fed and on time?\n\nLets examine the same behavior in the workplace. If 50% of the people in your department at work are bitching about a problem they want another department to fix, do you think the department that could fix it is going to want to? No. They will dig in their heels and fight back, and if they do fix the problem it will be begrudgingly and trust will be lost.\n\nNow when _**anybody else**_  in your department has an issue and asks the other department for help, they will not feel motivated to help that person. Then you and your 50% of the department are indirectly responsible for making life harder for other people within your department.\n\nThis is exactly what you're doing to the boards and the other players who care about the same issues as you. People like you are the reason everybody complains about circlejerking on the boards. People like you are the reason nobody takes the boards seriously when feedback and suggestions are posted.","replies":[{"poster":"DonnieDarkin","date":"2017-04-22T19:11:13.579+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Riot doesnt treat their players with respect. Dont expect me or anyone to feel like they deserve any.\n\nYou don't seem to ge it. Over 3 years, I have seen nearly every polite post that is CRITICAL of Riot or a decision or a designer, not get real responses from Riot. If they are indeed reading them, then they lack the god damn common courtesy to acknowledge with a comment or at least show ups how many Rioters viewed our post.\n\nSo we fly blind when writing posts that we want Riot to see. And what do we get? We get gaffed off for a year by Riot when we all demanded solo queue back. We get lectured by them on why the new system was better. Finally they see things our way and bring it back.\n\nI dont think they respect us, they see us as money and that is all. It takes a lot to get their attention.","replies":[{"poster":"HalcyonDweller","date":"2017-04-22T21:03:49.066+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Respect and Disrespect are two opposite ends of the spectrum. Not responding is somewhere in between, not full-tilt on the side of disrespect. Also I'm 95% certain it's company policy that they are not allowed to comment.\n\nThe thing is, Riot is a very large company, and they have even stated that politics plays a role in how quickly change occurs. When they took solo queue away there might have been plenty of Rioters who noticed and agreed with the player-base once the complaints started flowing in. It takes time enact change or reverse the flow of a decision made within a large organization.\n\nThat is probably part of the reason they don't comment on gameplay posts. Because they are individuals who have their own opinions and ideas, but we as a community would not see it that way. This could lead to a huge problem in miscommunications and misunderstandings.","replies":[{"poster":"DonnieDarkin","date":"2017-04-23T03:35:10.239+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"But Riot is all about money.
