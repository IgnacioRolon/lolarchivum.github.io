You'd have to pick between buying an item that gave Stats A, B C instead of Stats A, D, E, but there'd never be any reason to deviate from that choice for offensive items since one will be numerically superior for your champion. Defensive items would come down to \"am I fighting Physical or Magic damage?\", and after answering that question the single item that best suits your champion would be apparent.","replies":[{"poster":"DonnieDarkin","date":"2017-04-10T16:58:51.229+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Its amazing how little imagination people have.

I just think that there are too many ways to homogenize champions.  Just because we have these items and summs doesnt mean we should keep going by adding MORE things to give MORE abilities. The game eventually will become too complicated and too hard to balance. It will be harder to calculate trades in your head.

Giving jumps or heals to champions via tiems is not the same as say banshee veil or GA. Jumps and heals and dashes are way more common in a kit. Hardly anyone has GA or something like it, and spell shiedl is pretty rare. So I have no problem letting items give abiliies tha most champions dont have in their kits. Are you starting to understand?  And what were those REALLY good reasons btw?  Read the dev posts? Sure lets read when they made the new mastery system and thought that crit mastery was going to be good, but as well all knew back then, it was going to b cancer on yas and trynd, and they had to get rid of it. So forgive me if I could give a shit what Rito says in their dev posts.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"DonnieDarkin","date":"2017-04-10T17:27:43.123+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"How are you disagreeing?
