I'M not the one making the decision.  Then again, I would make the same decision.  Riot has enough that they want to do instead of implementing new features in a client that they are no longer planning on supporting in the very near future.  That's not facism in any way shape or form. lol","replies":[{"poster":"DonnieDarkin","date":"2017-03-25T20:44:15.817+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Sure it is. Honestly, if every player at 5 minutes decides they want to surrender, that should be their choice too. It would rarely happen, but if every player decides that the time saved in surrendering is worth the risk that they might somehow win the match, that is their prerogative.","replies":[{"poster":"Hethalean","date":"2017-03-25T20:50:24.488+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol so I'm guessing that Airplanes are fascists too.  If everyone on the plane wanted to lane this moment, if you're not on the ground within 5 minutes.  The pilots are fascists. FORCING THOSE POOR PEOPLE (now slaves really) TO STAY ON THE PLANE!","replies":[{"poster":"DonnieDarkin","date":"2017-03-25T21:26:45.872+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Dude that comparison is so ridiculously unrelated to this topic its mind boggling that you even used it.

I can't help you.  Like I understand school may have just had a class about fascism as a bird's eye view yesterday.  Doesn't mean everything is fascist when you don't get what you want.","replies":[{"poster":"DonnieDarkin","date":"2017-03-25T21:32:24.700+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"The difference there is nothing at stake beyond our personal time. With a plane, there are other factors that matter. When you go on the plane you surrender control voluntarily and the plane trip serves a purpose. \n\nLeague is just about your personal time, there are no other passengers, or time schedules pilots need to keep. If everyone wants to opt out and they all agree, then no one is harmed. If every passenger wants to opt out and they try to, well, people might literally die if they try to take control of the plane.\n\nYour comparison is one of the stupidest I have ever seen.\n\nAlso, don't get hung up about the word fascist. I threw that out there as an exaggeration. Private companies can't be fascist. There is no gun to our head forcing us to play.  What I object to is Riot telling me I MUST play for 20 minute even if myself and all teammate don't want to. Its like they are saying that players are not capable of making good decisions so we can't let them surrender early.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"His Dinoboy","date":"2017-03-25T20:06:56.210+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"honestly i do not think 15 minute surrenders is a good idea. i shouldn't have to sit through a 4 minute q time to just have 15 minutes of fun.","replies":[]}]}
