Especially if you found yourself in as situation where you had to build a lot of damage such as{{item:3153}} {{item:3071}} {{item:3812}} and the enemy team has near equal amounts of AD and AP threats. \r\n\r\nI dunno, the fact that it gives AD now is super weird and feels wrong as a concept. Armor gives AD? So, should swords give Armor?","replies":[{"poster":"Doctor Jarvis","date":"2017-05-22T02:51:05.959+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"It was stupid that AD champs didn't have an item that gives armor and AD when they had items that gave AD and MR. IT was stupid for GA to give tank stats when it was meant for carries.

Im just saying that there was a need for a certain type of item, which the GA now fills, and that the stats on the old GA didn't fit the main people who actually built it, which it now does. Balancing around that is more Riot's problem than mine at the moment.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"MysterQ","date":"2017-05-22T03:09:07.321+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I hate the new GA sooooo much.\n\n1. I hated teams that stacked GA originally. Fighting vs 3 GAs is stupid.\n2. Now only certain teams can stack GA, so it is even worse! At least back then we could stack GA back. But now instead they are rushing GA and we don't use AD so it is like ha enjoy your Zhonya or Banshee.. .ok. \nSeriously 3GA vs 3Ga was disgusting.
