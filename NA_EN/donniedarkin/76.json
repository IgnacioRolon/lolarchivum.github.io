Here is a solution concept.","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":6,"down_votes":8,"body":"I think the growth per level of a champion should be very small between levels 1-6, medium (the numbers it is now for a given champion) at levels 7-12, and higher at 13-18. \r\n\r\nSo instead of champion getting 85 health per level and 3.2 AD he might get only, say, 60 and 1.2 AD per level at 1-6. Then 85 and 3.2 levels 7-12 and then 100 and 5.2 per level at levels 13-18, with the end max base stats still being the same as it is now.\r\n\r\nSomething like that, something where there is a better back and forth early on where the better play can win with consistency even if they mess up early.  Again, something LIKE that. Don&#039;t knit pick the numbers of my example its JUST AN EXAMPLE. \r\n\r\nThis really would help in so  many ways. It will make the game less toxic because players won&#039;t be typing GG as much just because someone died in lane. It will also make the game less snowbally, which would be a good thing.","replies":[{"poster":"PhDs Nuts","date":"2017-04-10T04:51:29.969+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"My solution: delete keystones.","replies":[]},{"poster":"oSEXYPLATYPUSo","date":"2017-04-10T03:41:16.111+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"no no no remember you dont have fun and dont wanna play no more ?","replies":[{"poster":"DonnieDarkin","date":"2017-04-10T03:47:07.950+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Yes thats why I am posting ideas.","replies":[{"poster":"oSEXYPLATYPUSo","date":"2017-04-10T03:48:04.520+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"if you enemy screws up and you get a lead from it you should be able to snowball that lead and win the game \n\nstop handicapping the game","replies":[{"poster":"DonnieDarkin","date":"2017-04-10T03:53:33.341+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Right, so would you play a poker tournenment where if you lose one early pot, you are severely handicapped? Its unhealthy for the game and doesn't reward consistent skill. Thats why the best poker players win consistently in big tournaments with large starting stacks and long blind structures.
