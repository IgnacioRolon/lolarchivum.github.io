Games couldn't git 'good enough' so the 'higher ups' closed it down. Course EA Games kind of is notorious for the former and really any new MOBA is going to have a ridiculous time trying to become top tier unless they pull stuff like Mobile MOBAs or extremely 'semi-unique' MOBAs (Aka 'Smite') or just plain not give a fk and just keep running it even if it ends up becoming some pay to win B.S. rip off clone moba.\n\nPlus you have to recall you can't blame Riot for every single issue on it when you got things like Tencent owning the company basically and when you got a higher up company on a ownership chain, more then likely they are going to force certain policies. Not that Riot is completely innocent but you then also have to include pressure from other sources whether its the playerbase, competitive scenes in E-sports and the typical 'rather not step on a land mine strategy' a good deal of companies would adopt at times to delay things like releases or cranking out content fast on the games they release/upkeep to not end up breaking the game with such a major bug that it ends up with the game in a similar state:\n\n\"As when Ubisoft fked up on that one Assassin's creed game and resulted in disembodied head bugs flying around, making one hell of a horror moment in gaming.\"\n\n\"Because we all know when a company rushes a game(whether it be releasing, expansions or just a plain update), it results in alot of content missing and could even have thrown content originally slated to be in the actual game get butchered in as paid DLC(Looking at you Destiny and Star wars Battlefront)\".\n\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}} \n\nSeriously atleast make your trolling post a little more witty and 'try' to make it sound better then just \"Shut the game down and make them start from scratch\", because its not going to stop the 'new' people being hired from repeating the same mistakes as the last batch of mooks that started the game, have to dodge a bunch of copyright tape to make new champions(less your Blizzard who can just yank every single released champion from the hoarde of lore they have on all the games they've launched), plus then have to build back up a uniqueness and identity that will now just be dominated by Dota 2 and likely Heroes of the storm(less their's some other super popular MOBA that's better then hots) likely being the top two MOBAs at that point in time if LoL were to kick the bucket.","replies":[{"poster":"DonnieDarkin","date":"2017-04-03T04:14:26.185+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"You want to stop the process?
