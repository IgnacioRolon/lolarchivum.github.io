Its so unsatisfying to play against him. Now even more obnoxious with the new GA.\r\n\r\nHe can build attack speed, GA and a tank items because he does true damage.

There's a massive difference between 1 and 2 CC's mainly because (if they are a good yi,) they will most likely Q you while the skillshot/missle/auto animation is rolling.
