Free to play generates more money to play to play. So lets not put Riot on some pedestal as if F2P is somehow a great service to customers.  If anything, its a huge disservice to gamers who would have no problem paying a fee to play, and knowing that at the very least, balance changes are not being made to drive RP sales. \n\nAnd furthermore, when the game meta starts so suck and there are tons of issues, I have a right to be upset without people saying just move on. We have invested time and sometimes money into the game. We don't want to have all of that be a waste because Riot wants to get stupid.\n\nIf we didn't play the game, Riot wouldn't make money. We are customers and like any customer of any service or product we shouldn't be shut down for complaining, as if we are just supposed to walk away from years of a hobby without first trying to see if they company will fix the problems.","replies":[{"poster":"oSEXYPLATYPUSo","date":"2017-04-10T01:24:46.605+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"they make money for ads on their pro scene ... they make money on micro transactions in game.. suchs as RP for skins and champs which you dont have to spend any money to actually play\n\nso to say you have to pay to play is out of line and completely wrong","replies":[{"poster":"DonnieDarkin","date":"2017-04-10T01:29:02.695+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Haha do you really think most of their money they make is not make from micro transactions ?You are of touch dude. \n\n10s of Millions of players spending $5 here, $10 there a few times a year perhaps or more...if you can't see how that can easily turn into hundreds of millions or more, you must have failed math.","replies":[{"poster":"oSEXYPLATYPUSo","date":"2017-04-10T01:30:37.310+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"that $5 , $10 is the micro transactions i mentioned ... \n\nbut you dont have to spend any money at all to play the game... \n\nill wait for you to proof to me that you have to buy something through RIOT to play their game ?","replies":[{"poster":"DonnieDarkin","date":"2017-04-10T01:34:40.091+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"So basically you are saying that because some people don't spend money and some do spend money, no one who plays is allowed to complain about the game?
