He does a lot VERY well. Incredible engages, incredible tankiness, good damage.\n\nHe is almost always oppressive. He is never a bad pick in nearly any team comp.\n\nWhy does Riot let stuff like this exist for so long while they gut other champions?\n\nI have never once seen Zac on the enemy team and not groan.  I have never once seen Zac picked on my team and not got excited or at least nodded in approval of such a solid pick.\n\nI know most of you feel the same way.","replies":[{"poster":"GamblerOfLives","date":"2017-03-25T01:18:35.886+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"he lacks in dmg:)..he has 0 dmg and his ap scalling sucks.  his clear speed sucks (compared with other champs), and his early game is so bad, that almost every jungler out there can fck him up.\n\nLuckily the balancing of champions revolves around high elo players:)","replies":[{"poster":"DonnieDarkin","date":"2017-03-25T01:24:53.732+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay well my experience of over 5000 ranked matches has never shown me any of that. 99% of the time over the last 2 years, he is a solid pick.
