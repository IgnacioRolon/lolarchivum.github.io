LUX","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":2,"down_votes":7,"body":"They will have to nerf this or her in some way down the road. Its way too oppressive even mid game, and espcially late game. Blasting off 1000 damage blast 2 times in one short team fight.  Ridiculous.\r\n\r\nHow did Riot get so detached from reality? It really is mind boggling that off all the things they could have done for lux, that his was what they decided on. \r\n\r\nI feel like every year Riot&#039;s judgement calls on what to change and who to buff or nerf gets worse and worse. I think their company gene pool has been infested with too many people with jobs that have no business having that job, but they knew the right person.  \r\n\r\nI don&#039;t think I can take it much longer.  That game hasn&#039;t gotten better. As they make new champions and new items, they continue to stack complication that makes it even harder to balance the game.  \r\n\r\nThey really don&#039;t care. Trust me, higher ups don&#039;t care. They are content to let the little idiots at middle management make all sorts of dumbfuck decisions as long as they see the revenue come in. And where does the revenue come from? RP  points. Why would people want those? Because they just buffed a champion and want to buy it and dont want to wait to save up IP. Or they released new skins that players just gotta have.  \r\n\r\nI love how Free to Play makes more money than Pay to Play...yet people use the fact that the game is Free to Play as some credit to Riot, as if its so noble of them to do that...when they are simply doing what pays the most. \r\n\r\nI for one, really REALLY wish the game was pay to play so I knew for sure that balance changes are not being influenced by trying to drive sales.  I guess I&#039;m alone in this thinking.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-04-07T01:59:47.240+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Low ELO problems.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Umbral Regent","date":"2017-04-07T01:44:19.225+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you can't trust Riot's judgments, don't play League of Legends, it's as simple as that.\n\nOr, y'know, try to walk away from the red line when Lux is on the enemy team.","replies":[]}]}
