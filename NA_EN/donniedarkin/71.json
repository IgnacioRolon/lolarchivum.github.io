Not a good decision.\r\n\r\nBUT if you DON&#039;T focus him, he does high damage and can finish off several of you with his ult.\r\n\r\nGiven how he people build him, I think he does both way too well for it to be considered balanced. \r\n\r\nThere are many bullshit champions, and Darius of course can lose, but the fact that I&#039;ve seen him in this spot so many times, with my team not knowing what to do about him, is a problem to me. Its too much, and its too much cheese with that repeatable ult.","replies":[{"poster":"RenownedWheat42","date":"2017-05-23T01:05:39.516+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"http://i.imgur.com/oPbGUI5.png","replies":[]},{"poster":"MissingKayo","date":"2017-05-23T00:51:13.712+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Or C, you CC him and beat the shit out of him with Mortal Reminder + DPS?","replies":[]},{"poster":"420 grams","date":"2017-05-23T00:48:39.007+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He is super weak in the most important stat in the game; mobility. \nHe can be kited so easily and you can never be touched by him if you don't want to.","replies":[]}]}
