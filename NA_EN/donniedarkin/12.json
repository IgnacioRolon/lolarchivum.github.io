Giving 40 AD and armor and a revive to an already overly tanky ranged champion. Fantastic. \r\n\r\nI think Riot is really going off the rails and these change are quite dramatic and its going to effect SO much, it will make the balancing even harder. \r\n\r\nI LOVE the idea of the new GA for Aatrox, bu its going to be so much more cancer on other champions. \r\n\r\nWhat are they tyring to achieve? What is their end game? They make changes but what is their goal?\r\n\r\nI wish they would explain what measurements they use to define success.","replies":[{"poster":"6Sfool","date":"2017-04-10T03:43:52.222+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"So you're complaining that the champion who just lost his mr will start building an item that also lost its mr.  You're also saying that your champs should be allowed to benefit from it, but other champs should not.  OK.  I don't even think GA will become popular on Graves, since he should be focused on Cleaver, an MR item, and the rest damage.  The biggest abusers will probably be botlane adc's facing burstier champs, or skirmishers, and arguably Graves isn't either.","replies":[{"poster":"Spoofghoul","date":"2017-04-10T13:03:12.238+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Instead graves now builds the new mr item adaptive helm since he can afford too because ga now gives the ad he needs\n\nlets see how that is going to work out","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sun Wu Ryuumoku","date":"2017-04-10T16:42:46.025+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"GA is trash on newtrox","replies":[]}]}
