Because you know what, it really feels like the system will either give you sack of shit teammates, like for 5 or 6 games in a row, and then switch back to normal performing teammates. Is Riot fuckng with us?","replies":[{"poster":"Mojihito666","date":"2017-05-22T06:36:58.071+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Look this is secret for a reason.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Who is Taliyah","date":"2017-05-22T02:50:09.108+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah so I will explain it really short here.\n\nLook, Riot has a big space station just 50.000 miles above earth.\nInside that space station there are roughly 34.000.000 monkey sitting in front of ultra highspeed computers and pack players together into a game.\n\nFor example you're in queue now a monkey in the space station sees that you want to play a game. Now the monkey has a hard choice:\nWho should the monkey choose to play with you.\nHe looks up your recent games and if you won a few recently, the monkey will pick bad performing players for your team and mix together 5 smurfs for the enemy team.\n\nIf you ever wonder why the queue time sometimes takes 5 - 10 minutes, that's because the monkey can't decide and has to ask his superior for further actions.\n\nHope I could help you out there.","replies":[{"poster":"DonnieDarkin","date":"2017-05-22T02:54:14.432+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I fucking knew it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Name Peri ","date":"2017-05-22T02:28:55.493+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It matches you based on MMR. \n\nIf a gold 5 player has lower MMR - Which is dropping elo, \n\na silver 2 player has higher MMR - gaining elo, \n\nthey will be placed in the same game regardless of their current rank.\n\nP.S .... the first step to winning games is to not blame your teammates and focus on your own mistakes and what you could have done better.","replies":[{"poster":"DonnieDarkin","date":"2017-05-22T02:44:19.782+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah of course, but there are some cases where, it really doesn't matter what you do.
