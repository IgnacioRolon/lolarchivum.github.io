But still, if you were assigned Jungle, you are expected to have it. There is no reason why we can&#039;t have a pop up when the game starts, if you were assigned Jungle, that asks you &quot;Did you forget Smite? Please click the summoner spell you want to replace or cancel&quot;\r\n\r\nEvery little thing Riot can do to make sure matches are as fair with the least amount of aggravation helps. They should implement this. I know they need a god damn committee and 12 months to implement it, but hey, maybe someday.","replies":[{"poster":"Rindin14","date":"2017-05-03T00:48:59.097+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I completely agree.\n\nEither riot should make non-smite builds viable again (please) or add a function that guarantees that you have smite as the jungler.","replies":[]}]}
