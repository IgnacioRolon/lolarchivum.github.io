Her ultimate is pretty much always up late-game anyways.\n\nIf they want to buff her, I'd prefer one (or more) of the following options:\n\n* +5 MS (which would restore it to her previous value)\n* Casting W doesn't interrupt movement (improved chasing/escaping)\n* Slight increase to her passive's damage in early levels (improved last-hitting, pushing, trading)\n* Adjust the speed of her W (i.e. increasing speed the further it travels)","replies":[{"poster":"Im sorry Yannick","date":"2017-04-04T11:09:23.784+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"wow thats a perfect buff for her to make her more playable :))","replies":[{"poster":"KmeckYT Gaming","date":"2017-04-05T05:34:08.241+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"She is enough playable, nearly noob champion","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Monstertrio","date":"2018-04-04T22:33:56.271+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For fucks sakee !!

She is a medicore mage, dmg wise why you are so afraid? Lux could only do something with a proper Q,E,R combo - not like she 1 shotted you ,please....now hitting a combo will be more rewarding. Yes I am a Lux main ,but i don't see why you should go crazy over it. I have seen ppl which knows exactly how to avoid my skills.\n\nYay! <3 Luxy","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rainbow Beam","date":"2017-03-26T14:40:03.507+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'll think se should test the \"buff\" to see if it's really op, anyways, lux ult can be avoided with dashes,  Zhonya, or other champion passives as malzahar's and also you have to aim it, (if q didn't hit). Think it will be a nice change :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Aeko","date":"2017-03-24T16:33:19.530+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Agreed, for such a strong ability I don't see the logic behind this buff. It's already super low at max level. You can say it's hard to hit and easy to miss but in the middle of the team fights, people are not going to see the snare you throw that chains into your ult... Ridiculous buff that is unnecessary.","replies":[]}]}
