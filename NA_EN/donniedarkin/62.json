They pay us lip service in their thoughts on gameplay posts, but they don&#039;t really think its an issue.\r\n\r\nSo because they are detached from reality, as usual, they don&#039;t calculate reality. The reality is that both teams are going to ban 2 or 3 of the same champs most matches, and we will get less than 6 champs. We are going to get LESS than now.\r\n\r\nJust wait for Riot&#039;s pathetic typical apology about this after it happens. This is how I know these people aren&#039;t that smart. I am here on record telling you what is going to happen, it will happen, Riot will apologize and try to fix it, and you all wonder why I give them no credit. Its shit like this, that&#039;s why.","replies":[{"poster":"Sraeg2013","date":"2017-05-23T17:03:56.849+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"If Yasuo is your only concern then you are either blinded by hate or have no care in life.\n\nAs for the number of bans then the bare minimum of unique bans is 5 meaning both teams ban exactly same champions.\nI reckon the average will actually end up being 7 unique bans.\nStill better than 6, but definitely not 10.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lauchmelder","date":"2017-05-23T16:46:35.576+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"As long as Yasuo gets a 100% banrate in my games I don't care tbh.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hexs Fortune","date":"2017-05-23T17:01:24.398+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"RIght now your team has 3 bans + whatever RNG the opposing team bans\n\nAfter the change your team will have 5 bans + whatever RNG the opposing team bans\n\nNet profit","replies":[]},{"poster":"dim2a","date":"2017-05-23T16:56:54.550+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"No, we are not going to end up with less than 6 bans on average. The only way to end up with less than 6, is if both teams ban the exact same five champions.
