Sometimes I can carry. I'm generally not worried about auto-filling. I main mid and top - but I know the other roles. \n\nHowever, not everyone in every game has had more that a year in league. I'm bronze 3. I'm right in the middle of the lowest rank. People in bronze are in bronze because either they are still learning, or have no interest in learning. There are thousands of combinations of matchups and items and team comps and skill combos. Bronze is where people work those out in a competitive setting.  I would like to climb. I finished bronze 1 last season. I started bronze 5 this season. But sometimes a game can be ruined because someone on the team does not know their role, or cannot adapt their role as the game progresses and power shifts. \n\nIn bronze ELO JG is auto-filled quite commonly. The team with the experienced jungler has a better chance of winning every time, regardless of team comp. When this happens in promos.. its aggravating.
