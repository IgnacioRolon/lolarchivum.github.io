However, if you are playing and not 100% focused, you can easily mess up trying to stack or think you had stacked or planed to have stacked to Hellbent only to not and then die and not revive. Its super annoying. Its another layer of concentration that a player needs to have JUST TO HAVE ANY PASSIVE BENEFITS. Its an undue burden to place on a player. Besides, how the FUCK is it a PASSIVE ability when you CONSTANTLY HAVE TO ACTIVELY ACHIEVE IT? Hardly passive.\r\n\r\nIts still such a steaming pile of shit, and I still despite Riot for avoiding directly engaging with us and all the hundreds of posts over the last month.","replies":[{"poster":"xxxDogmanxxx","date":"2017-04-03T10:19:59.466+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So sorry that your champion now has to work to get a free GA.","replies":[{"poster":"DonnieDarkin","date":"2017-04-03T17:22:30.578+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No he has to work to have ANY passive benefits, including attack speed and bonus AD.
