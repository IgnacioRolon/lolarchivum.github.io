Laners need to know this and play safe until their jungler comes online and is able to start doing things. \n\nRundown: Jungle Runs on an XP and a gold deficit. We get less gold and less xp than laners. This forces us to only go for the ganks that are set up. This means the enemy laner must be damaged to at minimum 3/4 hp. and the be pushed up. Also they cant be too far ahead or its gonna mean we die too because believe it or not we do jack shit for damage before we get items.\n\nIf you are 0/2 before we finish our first clear we arent going to help you.

I think you forget that this is a game agains people, who can be tricked and outplayed, not to mention they aren't perfect and can mess up. To say 0/2 or /3 is a lost cause is saying that you are okay with how fed the enemy lane gets, which is near invetitable , and you are HOPING that whatever actions you take will compensate for that, which are no were nearly as inevitable as far as success rate goes.\n\n\"\"I could gank for the 0/3 Darius top and die to the 3/0 fiora with a black cleaver at 10min in...... or i could gank for our 1/0/0 syndra mid and get her further ahead so we can shut down the fiora later in the game\"\n\nI mean, you are arguing against yourself here. Do you REALLY think that you er going to get you mid outfed over that fiora? In your heart of hearts, you know that you rarely are going to help that mid catch up to the already 3 kills fiora has, and what she is sure to get later on.\n\nI know league players like to regurgitate ideas they hear, but really, just analyze your matches and think about this.

If the jungled is constantly banking then lanes should be safer and if you don't feed the jg kills your jgler who is power farming should come out ahead in gold and experience. Now if you don't ward lanes and push too far without extra pressure that's not on your jgler to fix. Often laners especially in low Elo do not know how to set up their lanes for ganks.

I am sorry you wont listen to it anyways, and honestly I laugh at post like this but that quote is super real. How often do laners want to to show up, magically cc a champ for 4 seconds, deal 99.99 of the damage but they somehow get the kill? Almost everytime I gank. Where the wave is, how much cc you have, how well you poke and cc all lead into you getting ganks. And honestly if you get first blooded people expect you to be a potato and don't help you because why waste their time when they could gank someone else in hopes to get them ahead. 3 or 4 fed people can kill a single fiora, unless you are so bad she kills you 10 times in lane.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
