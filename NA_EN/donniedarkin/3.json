Lets say the win rate gap closes between 2 champions, but then with items one champion does much better than the other that he had a similar win rate to without items.  This would indicate that items are effecting the balance of the game more than kits.\r\n\r\nOr,lets say that the win rate between champions widens without items.

Too many general items that give too many stats, makes the difference between many champions seem less noticeable.","replies":[{"poster":"k wìx","date":"2017-03-26T18:49:02.167+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You might like DOTA a fair amount more than league, then. Watch out for that learning curve, though! \n\nUltimately, I agree with your point here - I'd really like to see items not only become more diverse, but allow champions to be played in new and exciting ways.\n\n**The problem is that generally becomes extremely difficult to balance. ** An item that lets Ashe become more mobile and harder to catch might be perfect and offer a 'new and exciting way to play her' ... but it then makes Kalista absolutely broken.  I know a lot of people are quick to rail league for balance issues, but in my humble opinion it is one of the most balanced and well-designed mobas you can play.\n\nThe reason items are 'simplistic' in nature is because its easy to tell what they do and what you get out of them. Compare the items with DOTA and its insane how much more complex they are - not that its a bad thing per say, just a different approach to it.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Jbels","date":"2017-03-24T16:58:37.929+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The game is balanced around items.

Every champion is designed to function with a steady increase in gold and thus items.  Never mind the fact that snowballing would almost not exist without items which means everyone's playstyle would be super aggressive (no one would cs) and always fight because their is no benefit to not fighting. \n\nIf everyone was just using base damages then whoever has the highest early game base dmg would be op.
