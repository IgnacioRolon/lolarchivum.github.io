So why is his win rate not better?","replies":[{"poster":"NorthTurtle11","date":"2017-03-29T16:17:01.288+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"cause they gutted him way to hard","replies":[{"poster":"BeatzBoyFTW","date":"2017-03-29T16:18:16.588+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"That Q mana cost & E's initial damage nerf is still a \"love-tap\".

Turns out his kit is too strong for top lane, so they ignored the jungle and nerfed him repeatedly for his top performance.  The last Q nerf was way over the top - they could have just as easily reduced the W damage to champions, increased its range, and increased its damage to jungle creeps.  That way he could still be picked top as a dependable brick wall, but if he wanted to do damage he'd need to go back to rushing RoA, and his ability to jungle would be protected...but whatever, what do I know?  \n\nI'm hoping his rework isn't too extreme because I really liked playing him when Riot still allowed him to jungle.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Maximum Morde","date":"2017-03-29T15:57:22.788+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because tanking is trash in this meta.
