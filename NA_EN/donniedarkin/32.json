So then why are you trying to make another overloaded item? Also like others have said, you shouldn't make an item for only one specific champion in mind. That's how abuse cases happen when champions not designed for things suddenly realise that they can better utilise the item than the intended champion(s) for example, Runeglaive Ezreal.\n\nIf anything, League is literally built off of generic cover the base items and specialist items. It's plain, it's boring but that's how it works in LoL. If this game was more Dota 2 like, we might be able to see good item variety. Having too much of a generalist item where stats tend to rule doesn't seem like too good of an idea.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"DonnieDarkin","date":"2017-03-27T17:35:26.561+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeah because Riot really nails it, right?

At the moment what he really lacks is a defensive item that he can build that fits his kit. Bork, added in with some AS Marks and his passive will give you a decent amount of attack speed.
