Vel'koz's ult combo is frustrating, Volibear's bite is dumb on top of him being a ball of stats, Brand makes my time in bot annoying, and Alistar's WQ combo can't really be countered from my experience.","replies":[{"poster":"DonnieDarkin","date":"2017-04-05T19:09:34.800+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh boy here we go.
