Nerfs to tanks and now shift to mobile ADCs (require less peel) and more shielding supports has put top in a really good spot meta-wise.\n\nJungle is in a sad spot meta wise though.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sadistic Veigar","date":"2017-04-13T10:36:45.905+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Ahri","replies":[]},{"poster":"THE RlVER KlNG","date":"2017-04-13T16:13:49.586+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You forgot all the other mobile AD doushelords like Lee and Lucian and Yasuo and Fiora\n\nHonorable mention to the mobile AP miscreant Ahri","replies":[]},{"poster":"Epicphil1","date":"2017-04-14T06:51:59.836+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"DonnieDarkin","date":"2017-04-15T00:20:00.399+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I DO.
