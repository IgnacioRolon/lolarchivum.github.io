She isnt so good that she is a pick ban (Kassadin S3)\n\nShaco is NOT a perma ban champ. He is annoying but definately not worthy of perma ban.\n\nDarius...... no\n\nYasuo. No one likes playing against yas so yea.... probably.\n\nFizz.. What are you smoking? \n\nLee Sin. Dude.... lee isnt perma ban. \n\nSyndra. Depends on what people are planning on playing but I could see a lot more bans coming out\n\nIm more predicting Permenant Assassin bans because of the current player base's hatred of getting bursted. Im thinking that we will see a lot of {{champion:55}} {{champion:107}} {{champion:157}} bans with a dabbling of Strong mage bans like {{champion:103}} {{champion:134}} \n\nThe last 5 bans will probably be preferential bans like {{champion:164}} {{champion:35}} {{champion:427}} {{champion:90}} \n\nAnd whatever is currently OP will be banned. {{champion:497}} {{champion:498}} (I personally dont think Xaya will be broken but ey. its a new champ)","replies":[{"poster":"DonnieDarkin","date":"2017-04-18T22:51:11.099+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well i never see camille or ivern. 10 bans mean you can ban the ones you listed as well as mine.","replies":[{"poster":"Rewt","date":"2017-04-18T23:00:43.114+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im making a list based on what I see banned and what seems like is going to be banned based on the community response lately. Camille is a ban that i see in probably 40% of my games. And Ivern has been raising a lot of eyebrows recently. I'm expecting his ban rate to rise by a large margin fairly soon. Shaco and Malz just push some players buttons and they ban them (That's why they are in the preferential bans section) \n\nPeople are constantly complaining about getting one shot and so i suggested 3 champs that I see a lot of players hating who one shot you as well as 2 mages that are fairly strong in the current meta. \n\nYou made a semi troll post including Yasuo 4 times. I made a reasonable breakdown post that includes my own personal anecdotal evidence to try and give a possible ban scenario for silver play.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Salron","date":"2017-04-18T22:52:53.855+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahri \nDarius\nlol","replies":[]},{"poster":"AFilthyCaitMain","date":"2017-04-18T22:46:36.765+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:17}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"MrHaZeYo","date":"2017-04-18T22:36:47.139+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I mean, It's still gonna work the same as Pro banns. 6 champs banned, 6 champs picked, then 4 banned, 4 picked, So a lot of those champs will still make it through.","replies":[]}]}
