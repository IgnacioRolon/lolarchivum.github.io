These items can allow the controller to do things like:\r\n\r\nIncrease a turrets defense, or repair a turret or temporarily enhance its damage. \r\n\r\nThe controller can also, from time to time, increase a wave by 1 or 2 minions at the cost of 1 or 2 minions from another lane next wave.\r\n\r\n Controller can place 2 control wards instead of 1, and other wards last 1 minute longer. \r\n\r\nController can scrap a turret for parts based on how much health the turret has, and use parts to enhance other turrets or reinforce structures.\r\n\r\nI think something **_along these lines_**  (don&#039;t fucking knit pick the specific ideas i laid out, they are just examples) would get rid of the angst of support and allow all 5 players to have a solo role, but yet would increase the depth of strategy and complexity.","replies":[{"poster":"Kaioko","date":"2017-04-03T19:31:34.739+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Aside from your gameplay idea which I don't agree with but that can actually be debated; clickbaits are not appreciated.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JustJayson","date":"2017-04-03T19:37:41.615+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is nothing wrong with the support role. Support is as a significant a role as a jungler.  Games are won and lost by the actions of a support. Your controller role sounds useless and boring.

You want support to change from fighting in botlane with an adc while warding, shotcalling, and providing peel/engane/heals/shields to Some weird turret mechanic who runs around swapping minions from wave to wave who also occasionally ganks?\nAs a fill main, I think this idea is just flat out stupid...","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Wacky9","date":"2017-04-03T21:06:42.792+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Supports do actually have quite a bit of strategy and complexity. Because there is not a PURE ({{champion:16}} doesn't count) healing support, supports help out with some shields, some heals, and some CC.
