There are a lot of people who i see that are scared to play jungle.. they dont like the pressure. and often times in blind games i find that for some reason ADC is the last role called and someone will be like OMG i hate ADC.. which is a hell of a lot different than what you would assume. and while riot introduced autofill doesnt mean that its always support. I get moved to jungle sometimes even though i select support as my main role.\n\nI hate Corvettes... i think they are junk cars.. that doesnt mean that Corvettes are junk... and that the majority of people out there hate corvettes. just like you hate support... doesnt mean that everyone or even a large percentage of people dont like support. just that you dont like support. And from my experience... the majority of people who hate support are those who only enjoy the game when their KDA ratio is really high on kills instead of assists. Generally speaking of course.. not specifically stating you. just thats the majority of the mentality that i come across.. those guys that sit in chat and say ADC even though someone already called it and then say they are going adc anyway because they are going to carry.. lol.. those guys are douches and need to uninstall the game. because the focus of the game is team work.. and that team requires a support.","replies":[{"poster":"DonnieDarkin","date":"2017-04-19T20:49:11.259+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah sorry nerd, but I am not going to read or respond to your long reply.
