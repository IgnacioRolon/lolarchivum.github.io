Building {{item:3812}} or {{item:3074}} was not uncommon or unreasonable.\r\n\r\nBlades of Torment used to do magic damage and scaled off of AD and AP.  Now it just does physical damage.\r\n\r\nPhysical damage is often less effective in lane at top than magic damage. \r\n\r\nSo Aatrox has lost on two fronts:\r\n\r\n1)Phsyical damage instead of magic damage is a nerf\r\n2)Aatrox doesn&#039;t build high damage items as often anymore, and when he does, often not a rushed first item, thus making his E even weaker for laning purposes.\r\n\r\nI find his E ability to be very underwhelming to the point I feel like I am playing with not 4 abilities, but 3.","replies":[]}
