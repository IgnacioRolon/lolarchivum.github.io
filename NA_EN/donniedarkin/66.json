Because despite those, they still have faults and exploitable traits... \n\nbecause there is more depth and more qualities of champions than \"moves better than X, damage, and damage (listed again)\".","replies":[{"poster":"DonnieDarkin","date":"2017-04-01T22:29:16.791+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"13% pick rate for Ahri with a 53-54% win rate accross all elos.

This is not my only account, in fact I just made it recently specifically to fuck around with builds on the new Shitty Aatrox.\n\nThere are 130+ champions. I am not going to play the the ones that I KNOW are better and roll over for Riot. They way they have things now, it feels like 20 champions to choose from.  IE Ahri and her 13% pick rate. I won't be part of it. I would like to see more variety which means more champions that are viable at many elos, such as Ahri.","replies":[{"poster":"The Sword Saint","date":"2017-04-01T22:40:10.294+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Post on your main if you have one when you are on the forums, or don't expect anyone to care or respect your claims that 'I don't actually suck this bad'.\n\nIt's your own fault for not manning up and posting on your main.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Sujiren","date":"2017-03-31T21:10:48.222+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's impossible to make over a hundred champions equally good at the same time, but one thing I can guarantee you. You can pick almost any champion in the game that is not terribly oudated, main it and get to diamond atleast, only in the highest ranks the op picks start to matter, before that its mostly skill, and how good you are on your champ.","replies":[]}]}
