Why? Because they need it for clearing the jungle and to get the most out of Smite.\r\n\r\nHowever, you do see support players skip over a support items all the time.  ALL the time.\r\n\r\nI say fuck that.  Create a summoner spell that is for supports. Taking it lets you access support items. Make the spell really useful for supports so that they WANT to take it, the way Junglers take smite, and also make the benefits of the different support items for that smite be appealing to different types of champions the way the Jungler items are. \r\n\r\nSkipping vision is also not cool. I am for all final builds of all support item paths to include vision.  I am not for freedom of choice in this area. Take the support summoners spell, get a support item, get vision. Its what you do. Just like you take smite when you jungle and get a jungle item.\r\n\r\nI am tired of bot lane antics. People need to be reigned in regarding the support role.","replies":[{"poster":"Valderis Vandala","date":"2017-04-11T07:56:36.133+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes brilliant, lets give supports even less choice and be even less fun, that'll bring in more players.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kilanost","date":"2017-04-11T06:46:21.205+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The only reason some champions build the jungle item is for the extra jungle xp.  I could build health/5 and have pretty much the same outcome but have them build into stronger items than the jungle item (and all of them suck except cinderhulk btw when you compare them to other items you could buy...and soon cinderhulk will blow too if pbe changes keep).  Building a jungle item is actually extremely slot inefficient.  \n\nRed smite is the only other reason to build a jungle item.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Linna Excel","date":"2017-04-11T04:06:19.090+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think that AP junglers can probably avoid not finishing a jungle item.","replies":[{"poster":"HaIlMonitor","date":"2017-04-11T04:26:37.434+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If they had two one being {{item:3100}}  effect, and keeping the other as well as giving more mana regen in jungle I think we would see more AP champs besides the one. {{champion:60}} {{champion:60}} {{champion:60}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"HaIlMonitor","date":"2017-04-11T04:03:51.801+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you mean items that dont fit or give the utility most ap champs want?","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-04-11T03:56:45.489+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is no need to change the meta just because some bronze V supports are garbage or have dreams about solo carrying.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SexyBabyJesusZ","date":"2017-04-11T03:58:10.207+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"eh\n\nriot should just work on supports as a whole\n\nand also get rid of those mage supports that can 1v2 you in lane if you dont have leona cough cough zyra cough cough","replies":[]}]}
