There's a lot of other factors you need to keep in mind of. For example, look at her average winrate *By dedicated players* and you'll see that it's 56%, which is actually fairly average compared to many other champions. Dedicated Mains normally have 54%+ winrate, because they're experienced.\n\nAhri, as we can all admit, is fairly easy to play, so there isn't much of a gap between her skill floor and skill gap. As such, it doesn't take a whole lot to be good with her (there is still a degree, but not a whole lot). Because of that, a lot of Ahri players are near that skill ceiling, since it isn't hard to get to it, which means the Average winrate for Ahri is going to be closer to the Dedicated Main Winrate.","replies":[{"poster":"Eedat","date":"2017-03-26T04:26:57.551+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":3,"body":"> Look, you're going to need to learn, that Winrate alone is not whether something should get nerfed\n\nYet when any champ that isnt a mage or support hits similar numbers, the board forms a lynch mob to destroy them.

Cause when he's strong, he crunches the jungle pool cause he has everything you could want from a jungler.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fondling Gems","date":"2017-03-26T08:12:53.229+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"Most of those champs have a much higher skill floor though.  Vayne and Jhin aren't super high skill floor but due to their much less forgiving nature than Ahri the practice needed to play them on a good level, roughly that of someone who plays them a lot, is higher than Ahri's.  This means that a lot of their playerbase drags them down because they don't put in the games needed to master them.  As such when their playrates rise it means that people who are picking them up are doing too well for the champ difficulty.\n\nAhri also has a VERY consistent playerbase.  I can't think of another champion with as large of a playerbase that sticks with her.  Large playerbases tend to lower winrate because it means more new players are playing them and a smaller percentage of people are maining them.  Ahri however breaks this general trend due to her very dedicated fan base.  In other words new Ahri players KEEP playing her and later make up for their early drop in winrate.  This is in comparison to people who play half a dozen games on a champ then stop playing them, causing a negative impact on their winrate.\n\nAhri just happens to come together into a combination of easy to learn, forgiving, and a dedicated playerbase which boosts her winrate up substantially compared to other champions who only fulfill some of those.  \n\nHarder champs have lower winrates because new players drag them down more.  Less dedicated playerbases drag down winrates because players don't stick with the champ and make up for their initial lower winrate.  Less forgiving champions can't be picked as freely (Ahri is a very good blind pick) which drops their playrate.\n\nThere is another reason as well.  Champions like Lee Sin didn't use to be such a huge issue until players realized they could ult > Q rather than Q > Ult.  This removed much of his counterplay.  In the same way Lucian Jhin and Vayne all got buffs/item buffs that removed most of their counterplay (Such as One/Two Shot Vayne meta)  Jhin also had a bit of a case of being well out of hand, far more than Ahri is.  He won 25% of games.  He was in over 50% of games with a 50% winrate.  That meant that half of all the wins in LoL for a patch or two had a Jhin on the winning team.\n\nComplaints surfaced about all of these because most of their counterplay got negated.  Ahri, while strong, has never been able to negate her counterplay.  She has exp/gold trouble working in a duo lane and in a single lane she has never been able to guarantee landing her abilities.  If you look at her winrate by player experience you can actually see it dropping.  This is because people playing her rise up until they hit the elo where people can dodge, because most of Ahri's damage can be dodged relatively easily.  Most of Ahir's power rests in enemies not dodging, as such her counterplay exists, most people simply have the issue of not being good enough to dodge perfectly dodge-able abilities.\n\nAhri has clear counterplay and when people are beaten by her they know they _could_ have played better in most situations.  They realize that the reason they failed was because _they_ didn't apply their mechanics properly.  It was a situation out of their control like Lee Sin ward hopping right next to you, binding you as he ults, then following with a Q>Q to 100-0 you while you are CC'd for the entire duration all as part of his own kit.\n\nPeople don't gang up on Ahri as much because much of her strength lies in her opponents failing to dodge, not because she is overloaded.  She gives the ability to outplay her and generally isn't going to roll over you anyways even if you do outplay her.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Academy Kayn","date":"2017-03-26T04:32:31.517+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"I've stopped trying to understand the Hivemind a long time ago.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Verdade","date":"2017-03-26T12:40:30.984+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":4,"body":"Problem is, if Lucian or Lee or Vayne become meta, they also become ban/pick.
