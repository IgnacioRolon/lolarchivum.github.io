It feels a little harder now.\r\n\r\nBut one thing that remains true--his play mechanics are cheese. He gets a {{item:3078}} and while his is combat his movement speed is spiking up to like 534 every few seconds, due to his passive and trinity force. Highly mobile, highly annoying. \r\n\r\nAnd lets not forget the his deny W move. What? You did damage to me and slowed or stunned me? Nah. W--massive heal and removing cc. Push of a button. \r\n\r\nOH, and his ever so fun barrels that zone the fuck out of people and deal tons damage across a tremendous range from himself when done right.\r\n\r\nIs he OP? If so, in which ranks? I feel like even though I beat him with Aatrox, if I was GP I would beat the fucking living shit out of an Aatrox once I learned how to play him well.","replies":[{"poster":"Knight Sky","date":"2017-03-20T22:34:54.717+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Gangplanks winrate is 47.88% , unless you talkin challeneger but thats only the top200 people.

The amount of damage most characters can get before GP can hit his power spikes is pretty high, plus this season it feels like the games are over 15-20 minutes in so not getting as much time to scale and build a big gold lead with Q passive. Granted, I'm in Silver 1 and have been having a hard time in general this season. But he definitely doesn't feel very strong right now for me.","replies":[]}]}
