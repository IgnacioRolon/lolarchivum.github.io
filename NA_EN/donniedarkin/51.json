Upon release of many changes, such as poppy rework, the community can instantly, withouth even fucking playing the champion, that that champion is now busted and is going to be nerfed. And of course Riot eventually nerfs the champion. So if so many things are obvious to us, why is so hard for them to see it?","replies":[{"poster":"Paquay","date":"2017-05-18T20:07:28.966+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Data points my dear Watson, data points. \n\nIf things are always so easy to see then no game would need to go through Beta and then there would be no rebalancing needed in all games.

I do assign that much thinking to them. Not to say that they don't make mistakes, but to assume they just re-write some code, call it good, then implement the changes is ridiculous.","replies":[{"poster":"DonnieDarkin","date":"2017-05-18T20:11:48.060+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"McDonalds run the worst most well known fast food chain.

They're nerfing his saplings because they're toxic and an unintended result of his rework. You're just complaining about what's essentially an exploit in his kit. He was redesigned to be a tank, not a cheesy burst mage. Maybe try reading the Insights posts that Riot posts before making a thread to complain about random stuff.","replies":[{"poster":"DonnieDarkin","date":"2017-05-18T16:55:42.661+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"\"They're nerfing his saplings because they're toxic and an unintended result of his rework. \n\nunintended?

Actual balance, requires to be tested over several games. More than they can accomplish on PBE, so balancing has to come from live data. \n\nThere's isn't much in the way of Thinking, or realistically theory crafting. Basically Riot has to make it's decisions based on the data. If there's error, then it simply comes from incomplete data. This would suggest that the Support Maokai shenanigans never showed up in PBE, or that it's effectiveness was understated. Riot simply doesn't have the man power to test everything in game by themselves. (By definition, beta testing is testing done by someone outside of the original product) But the PBE people can't be feverishly told to abuse test every aspect of the changes because they are effectively volunteers. \n\nAlso, too often do I see people theories about certain changes ending up being completely wrong. I would say that even Expecting Riot to be able to predict the outcome of their changes, would be simply ludicrous.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dukues","date":"2017-05-18T17:32:51.630+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"They definitely don't think everything through.
