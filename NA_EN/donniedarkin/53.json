ANY person who actually PLAYS the champ frequently (like myself) could have and DID point out the removal of strength of ages would KILL nidalee what?? FIVE patches before it went live. and yet they never ONCE bothered to even CHECK to see if that would happen in ONE test?\n\nthey NEED a bigger balance team with experience in the champion they are balancing or at at LEAST consult EXPERTS of that said champion\n\ni mean sure if they were only letting a few champsion be slightly un viable it would be ok... but when u have \nchamps that are sub 45% win rate and have been for over 6 months and over for nearly TWO YEARS. and they \"cant figure out of to fix them\" it means thier balance team has issues..  i can think of at least TEN different ways to make {{champion:76}}  viable, with just number changes.. ALL of which i KNOW would work.. and yet riot cant think of or even test ONE change?\n\ni mean i love riot games... and this year they have made some HUGE improvement i have been waiting for for a VERY long time, YEARS in fact.\n\nbut the fact is if they keep releasing new champions it becomes harder and harder to make sure the champsions people already know and love are viable. so if THEY arn't going to play the champsion (becuase it would be stupid to hire a main of each champion to ask for help.. they can at LEAST use the data people who MAIN the champ are willing to give for FREE.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pierce The Veal","date":"2017-04-23T19:55:08.060+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=AngelExcaliber,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=49EifBOH,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2017-04-23T19:52:17.254+0000)\n>\n> You do realize right that Riot has separate teams pertaining to the game?

If a champion gets fixed a few times and isn't good still, simply axe them. Use their abilities and shit in conjunction with other axed champion abilities to make legitimitely good champions. As for balancing? When there's a lot more champions, it would actually become simpler if they looked at it not as an art, but as a mathematical equation. Hell, a lot of what they do in balancing with just number changes could be automated. \n\nI'm approaching this as someone in the know, not as a layman. What I'm trying to point out to you guys is that if they really wanted to be producing at maximum output and providing content to you, they wouldn't be doing what they are doing.\n\nSure there were people complaining about new releases, but they always kept people on their toes. Every week or two there'd be something new. Although you saw whiners then, there weren't many people quitting because of it. Do you know what a lot of people are quitting the game now for? Because it's too fucking stale that's why. It's always the same champions, always a variation of the same strategies, and anything that diverges from the norm is removed or banworthy. But that doesn'tmatter as much because what's monetized is the E$ports.","replies":[{"poster":"Critmaster Garen","date":"2017-05-11T23:49:39.767+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=DracoMTA,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=49EifBOH,comment-id=000000020000,timestamp=2017-05-11T23:45:29.282+0000)\n>\n> Simple enough.

Woah, magic. There is a point where people really don't want another skin for another champion. For many people that's 1 skin, for another large anount of people it's 2 or 3. It's not difficult to do, and by the time the people own the skin it's fine because they have already spent the money. With sales churned up so high, giving refunds on axes shouldn't be a major issue. \n\nNow, the thing is it definitely is easier to maintain the game in its current state. It definitely is less risky.
