Partially true, if the game goes long enough. However, games almost never go long enough as the game stands.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, when you are behind in lane, you are likely zoned, and when you are zoned, its very hard to stack Hellbent, which means you dont have a revive, which means you are an easy target for ganks and for tower dives.  This makes it much harder to hold your own when behind or zoned.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, in general, playing Aatrox takes a lot more concentration now. You have to constantly be counting or looking at stacks to try to time engagements. Its quite an burden just to be able to have any passive benefits.\r\n\r\nMost of the time, Aatrox in play is a bare bones champion with no passive benefits. Let me list everything Aatrox doesn&#039;t have:\r\n\r\nA shield\r\nA Block\r\nA Parry\r\nA Spellshield\r\nAbilty to silence\r\nAbility to Blind\r\nAbility to slow attack speed\r\nAbility to gain bonus health\r\nResistances built into his kit\r\nBonus crits\r\nTrue damage\r\nAny armor pen\r\n%health damage\r\nAbility to boost movement speed\r\nAbility to vanish\r\nAbility to burn for damage\r\nInvulnerability \r\n\r\n...and now we can add in, a reliable passive\r\n\r\nWhat does he have?\r\nHealing, bonus damage, a dive, a knock up, a slow and a poke and bonus attack speed\r\n\r\nHowever, many champions have all or most of that PLUS some of the above mentioned powers.\r\n\r\nThis is why Aatrox is weak.","replies":[{"poster":"Truesworn","date":"2017-03-31T00:56:00.200+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh man, so true. I've dabbled in Aatrox a bit and gotten him to mastery six, with one mastery seven token and man, lemme tell ya. This champion has literally thee most basic kit in the game and it makes him so weak compared to let's say... Camille? Her Q alone probably has more text than all of Aatrox's abilities combined! xD","replies":[]}]}
