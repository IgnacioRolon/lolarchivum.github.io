OR do they just benefit MORE from items?\r\n\r\n{{item:3025}} for example works so great on tanky champs that need to spam abilities and have defense. It gives them a lot of what they need in one item.\r\n\r\n{{item:3078}} for {{champion:120}} {{champion:5}} works so well with their kits. If trinity force didn&#039;t exist or gave less, would Hec and Xin still be as strong?\r\n\r\nMAYBE some champions are considered strong because of how the items favor them over other champions.\r\n\r\nMaybe Aatrox&#039;s abyssal win rate right now has less to do with his kit and more to do with items.\r\n\r\nImagine if there was an item such as this:\r\n\r\nWindspeaker&#039;s Hammer\r\n500HP\r\n40 Attack Speed\r\n10 CDR\r\nACTIVE: Increase healing from all sources for 6 seconds by 10% 45 second cool down.\r\n\r\nOr something like that. You get the picture. Aatrox needs attack speed still and now benefits from building health. What a great first item it would be on him.\r\n\r\nAnyways, just a thought.","replies":[]}
