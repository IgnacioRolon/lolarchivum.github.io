If you want to flame someone, they can mute you. If they want to trash talk you after the match, you can leave the lobby. All that happens is that people find more creative ways to word their trash talking and flaming so as not to throw up red flags--the spirit of what they are saying is still there. Lets stop wasting time with trying to fix peoples behavior. It will always be at the same level no matter what you do. Whether you punish it or not. Ban someone, they play on a different account. Punish people for certain &quot;bad&quot; words, they just use different words. Trying to change human nature is a colossally retarded effort. Especially when you put 5 people in a game with strangers where you can often feel powerless. Of course people are going to get angry. WTF did Riot expect? There is a reason this is the most toxic game community--its human nature, and its exasperated by the VERY NATURE of the game.\r\n\r\nWhen you fuck with someones time, they are going to get pissed off. This is never ever going to change as long as people are people.  When things are out of a persons control they will get frustrated. This is never ever going to change as long as people are people.  What? So you think people should be more mature? If you think that punishment in this game is going to fix severe character flaws that are deeply rooted in other things, you have no concept of reality or human nature. \r\n\r\nOr, is it to protect minors who play the game and protect them from verbal abuse?

But yeah.\n\nI don't play ranked much, as I prefer a more casual atmosphere in pretty much all of my games. I don't think there's been a season where I've played more than 20-odd ranked games. I also have friends who are worse at the game than me who I enjoy playing ranked with on the few occasions that I do play it, which doesn't help you gain ranks.\n\nWhat of it? Not everyone is driven by seeing that MMR rise -- I COULD one-trick my two or three best champions through ranked and see where I actually end up, but that isn't how I enjoy League: I'd rather experiment with playing every champion, every position, and just have fun playing casually with my friends.\n\nOr maybe I'm just a Silver player. Who knows? I really don't care one way or another.\n\nI am sort of puzzled by why you brought either statement up though -- I don't know where you got that I was banned 5 times, or why you've decided to attempt to bring my my ranking out of the blue, but hey.
