However, his current Blood Rush is not the easiest thing to keep active or sometimes even acquire depending on the situation. \r\n\r\nOne thing that would help is improving his ability to chase down enemies. Keep it windowed in Blood Rush and allow it to be something that benefits him based on how much missing health the last champion that Aatrox hit has.\r\n\r\nSo for example &quot;During Blood Rush Aatrox is Ghosted (he looks cool hovering) and gains 1% movement speeds for every 5% of the targets missing health&quot;\r\n\r\nThis would make reward him for getting an enemy down to low health, and allow him to chase, which in turn helps him of course get kills but also makes it easier to keep his Blood Rush active. If you run the numbers I think you would see the bonus movement speed is going to range from 5%-25%, but more typically 10%-20% if chasing a squishy carry missing half health thru nearly all of it.\r\n\r\nToo strong?

You don't need to have the option of \"Just have higher movement speed and walk away to gut his effectiveness\" on top of it.\n\n-----\n**Universally Accessible Counterplay**\n1. His Q is hilariously telegraphed, and has a tiny radius.\n2. His E is slightly delayed, slow moving and tapers off at longer ranges.\n3. Kiting him deprives him of his defense and, if he loses his passive/ult, an incredibly amount of his power budget (atk spd, attack range, ad, lifesteal)\n-----\n**Champion Specific Counterplay**\n1. CC him, and his passive can usually be popped before it wears off.\n2. {{champion:55}} {{champion:110}} grievous wounds\n3. Mobility to avoid his already telegraphed skillshots and kite him until he loses most of his kit.\n-----\n**Semi-Universal Options**\n1. {{item:3165}} {{item:3033}} cut his lifesteal tanking down\n2. Some champions can favorably run {{summoner:14}}\n3. He needs several items to come online, and thus is prone to being bullied both in lane and in the jungle.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"DonnieDarkin","date":"2017-03-20T17:41:26.821+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, but so can any champion.

His move speed is negligable because landing a single E lets you stick to him unless you miss that or your Q. Also you should be bursting him 100-0 ( you probably run fervor when you should be running thunderlords )\n\nas far as black cleaver, theres better options given the current aatrox kit ( granted phylol hasnt posted a video on new good builds so people think the old shit is still whats best, when its really not )\n\n{{item:3153}} {{item:3124}} {{item:3047}} {{item:3046}} {{item:3143}}  this is your new core: 6th item is your choice\n\nTiamat / hydras have no place in the new aatrox setup\n\nYou need guinsoos for double proc opression\n\nRanduins helps with crit / sticking / heavy range damage\n\nTabis are obvious expecially with lethality\n\nPhantom isnt for the chase, its for the 12% reductiona and attack speed which synergizes stupidly well with tabis / phantom\n\nMR is covered by scaling blues, or you can opt for an MR item, but its typically pointless.\n\nBlack cleavers shred isnt neccesary, nor is its HP / damage. About the only reason to take BC is for the CDR which isnt really that helpful because aatrox is primarily AA based, and his ult is already a very low CD\n\nRegardless of whos a one trick or not, adaptation is the only way to excell.\n\nThe slow on randuins is so undervalued in aatrox its actually kinda funny.\n\nQ-> randuin -> botrk-> E = damn near 8-10 seconds of slows, which gives your Q time to refresh, if you havent killed your target by this point, youre probably gonna die\n\nGhost + flash are the ONLY viable summoners unless you jungle.\n\nExhaust / ignite serve little use compared to these 2.\n\nWe can debate all day, this is my 2 cents, take it or leave it, but aatrox is actually getting better when you learn to manage his passive at 4 stacks, but i do agree 100% that he should get 25% per ability whether its reducing the passive to 80 and making each give him 20 flat, or keeping it at 100 and making the abilities grant 25 flat","replies":[{"poster":"DonnieDarkin","date":"2017-03-20T19:13:04.327+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Name me which top laners don't have a way to increase their movement speed?","replies":[{"poster":"Ultra Rapid Fyre","date":"2017-03-20T19:20:00.404+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=DonnieDarkin,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=xon89PqB,comment-id=0002000000000000,timestamp=2017-03-20T19:13:04.327+0000)\n>\n> Name me which top laners don&#x27;t have a way to increase their movement speed?\n\nno one is saying they dont have a way to increase their move speed, but if you insist\n{{champion:23}}  - has a mobility ability but no way to increase actual move speed\n{{champion:58}}  - has a mobility ability but no way to increase actual move speed\n{{champion:75}}  - has no way to increase move speed\n{{champion:133}}  - asside from ult which is an ENGAGE, has no way to increase actual move speed\n{{champion:164}}  - has a mobility ability ( 2 actually ) has no way to increase move speed\n{{champion:122}}  - has no way to increase actual move speed\n{{champion:114}}  - has a mobility ability, but no way to increase actual move speed\n{{champion:41}}  - has no way to increase his move speed\n{{champion:67}}  -not typically a top laner but ( her passive increases her engage speed, but not disengage ) outside that has no way to increase move speed\n\nI could go on, but i just gave you plenty of cases where youre wrong.\nIf you cant stick to a target, the issue is still YOU and YOUR build, and missing your skill shots / abilities, and has nothing to do with aatrox's kit.","replies":[{"poster":"DonnieDarkin","date":"2017-03-20T19:43:25.342+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:23}} {{champion:122}} do way more damage.

Turrets receive 「 50% reduced damage 」.\n\nNice research on that one.\n\nAnd you can't go on.  Generally speaking the ones you listed are champions that are compensated by having more damage and better CC and/or defensive abilities like parrying or gaining instead health or resistances.
