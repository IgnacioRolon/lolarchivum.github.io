Internet goes out, computer crashes, emergency in real life.\r\n\r\nI mean, how come some of us can play for years and hardly ever DC? Are we just better at deciding when to play? Are we not kids whos parents make them stop playing and come to dinner?\r\n\r\nI propose that 3 disconnects in ranked play equal a lifetime ban of ranked play until they play x amount of matches in a row in normal without any disconnects.\r\n\r\nNot for situations where someone disconnects and then comes back after they restart their computer, I&#039;m talking about someone who leaves and never comes back.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m tired of paying the price. If you can&#039;t figure out how to manage your time so you can be able to finish a ranked match that you start, you have no business playing ranked and should be purged out of it.","replies":[{"poster":"Mizuki Zahra","date":"2017-03-24T20:31:59.972+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol so I should be banned because the power went out randomly? makes sense","replies":[{"poster":"DonnieDarkin","date":"2017-03-24T20:33:32.678+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"No, you still have 2 more lives.","replies":[{"poster":"DonnieDarkin","date":"2017-03-24T20:33:54.045+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"And if the power comes back on and you reconnect no punishment","replies":[{"poster":"Mizuki Zahra","date":"2017-03-24T20:36:25.153+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"power went out 5 times randomly in a months span, not even weather related just power box exploded because of a surge and at times a car hit a pole. power was out for a few days to a weeks span I did get lever buster but this has happened once in the span of 20 years at this location. still makes no sense to ban me for life where people are actually toxic and afk from a game for selfish reasons","replies":[{"poster":"DonnieDarkin","date":"2017-03-24T21:04:06.156+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"You live in a shitty place.
