If you win a few games in a row, it starts matching you with players who&#039;ve lost a few in a row, doesn&#039;t it?\n\nInstead of just random teammates around the same rank, they purposely built in these swings of wins and losses. \n\nSo instead of being matched with random and going WIN WIN LOSS WIN LOSS WIN WIN LOSS it always seemes to go WIN WIN WIN WIN WIN LOSS LOSS LOSS LOSS WIN WIN WIN LOSS LOSS LOSS WIN WIN WIN WIN.\n\nIts like Riot just HAD to make it as annoying as possible.","replies":[{"poster":"420 grams","date":"2017-05-26T04:29:02.219+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mmr is too sensitive.\nIt does swing too quickly to make win/loss streaks to keep everyone close to 50% instead of letting the law of large numbers make it happen. Their system is good for plat skill player to dominate a bunch of games and make it to plat, but it's terrible for gold 3 skill player to climb past gold 5 if they get stuck there by their win streaks gaining 100 lp and their loss streaks happening during promotionals","replies":[]},{"poster":"ChargeItDownMid","date":"2017-05-26T18:27:54.302+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"DonnieDarkin","date":"2017-05-27T01:53:51.518+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Right.
