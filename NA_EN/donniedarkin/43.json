Sure, right now its just that you like others being upset or annoyed, and its funny to you.  But taken further, that same flaw could easily let you enjoy the pain of others pr the death of others. Given some real power, you would certainly become a monster over time, a brutal tyrant who&#039;s ego is only placated by controlling others and harming others. \r\n\r\nAnd then they say, its just a game. Sure it is, but the person who is doing this is a total piece of shit human being and I am more upset at his existence than the match I just lost.","replies":[]}
