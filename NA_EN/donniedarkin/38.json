As if there was a different outcome when the mid is 2 levels and 7 kills ahead of you, and your teammates are useless. \r\n\r\nLeague players are not just toxic. They are literally stupid people for the most part.  Stupid people make people like me toxic. Its an endless vicious cycle rooted in human nature that is only exasperated by your personal rank being out of control in some many matches (feeling powerless leads to feelings of anger or sadness). \r\n\r\nI really wish Riot would figure out a way to take the sting off a little from losing a match where you played very well and your teammates did not.","replies":[{"poster":"Dîm Mak","date":"2017-04-10T03:34:08.017+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Then play Fizz, and get fed.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Yaśuo Main","date":"2017-04-10T15:48:39.717+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, I did gave a game where top and bot fed atleast higher than 5 kills.
