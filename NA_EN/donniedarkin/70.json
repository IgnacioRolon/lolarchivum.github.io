Meaning you are very open to being tower dived, and since Aatrox is very squishy in terms of his kit, this is very bad.\r\n\r\nGOOD JOB riot, you made the champion weaker in the very thing you sough to improve.","replies":[{"poster":"Taliyah Rocks","date":"2017-03-22T00:07:31.785+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Aatrox is the guy who's a diver but doesn't dive because he dies instantly but when he doesn't he can't dive because his only diving tool got CC'd but when it isn't he doesn't deal any kind of relevant damage.\n\nYup that's the guy.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dynikus","date":"2017-03-21T23:35:04.294+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"there are literally buffs going to aatrox tonight when the patch hits.","replies":[{"poster":"DonnieDarkin","date":"2017-03-21T23:39:32.126+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Haha those changes won't substantially increase his win rate.

Hell, common sense is enough to tell that those changes would be enough, and they couldn't even figure it out by playtesting it???","replies":[{"poster":"DonnieDarkin","date":"2017-03-21T23:37:40.879+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yup.
