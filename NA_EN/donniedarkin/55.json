On the topic of your opening post, I disagree with you because I like plants more then I liked the smite passives from last jungle because everybody can interact with them and  specifically on the topic of blast cones, they keep the jungle from being quite as punishing to low mobility champs giving them options to chase or escape. I also happen to like riot making large gameplay changes and taking risks as it keeps the game from getting to stagnate for me, so we may have a fundamental disagreement on what we want them to do as a company.\n\nYou did not really respond to the content of my post but I feel like you might misunderstand why I'm asking, I want to look over the kill and death maps to get more information on how your playing. Its not to get your Elo and then use that to discount your opinions. Your opening post, I want this gone fuck this gimmick does not provide me adequate information. Why do you want it gone, why do you feel its a gimmick. You have also not responded in this thread to any one but mine and the content of both was to be insulting. Moving on, We can agree to disagree on how we want the game to develop, you can ignore me, you can flame me, or we can discuss gameplay.\n\nTldr. Put more content and less anger into your posts if you want people to comment on content. Off topic I would appreciate it if you put a bit of effort into being nicer to folks.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Darkdemon653","date":"2017-04-19T22:15:43.379+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd be fine with them if they didn't allow people to go over walls.","replies":[]}]}
