Then delete the page, this should remove the corrupted mastery page. (I would try this first so you don't have to remove all the mastery pages:P)\n\nHope it works ^_^","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-07-24T15:37:17.026+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is pretty rare, but most of the time when I've seen this issue, it's caused by one or more Mastery page being corrupt. The common solution is to delete all of your mastery pages, relog, then create them from scratch again. It only takes a few minutes and should resolve the issue. \n\nLet me know if it worked!","replies":[]}]}
