So far, the ones I&#x27;ve seen are the following:\n> \n> * Zoe gets to recast her Q even when her ability to cast is disabled, as mentioned in the OP. Meanwhile, champions with recasts such as Anivia (E), Aurelion Sol (Q), Gragas (Q), Lux (E), Vel&#x27;Koz (Q), etc. have their ability to recast disabled while affected by ability-disabling crowd control. All of these recastable abilities are on a higher cooldown than Paddle Star, and several them are equally, if not more time-sensitive, and will miss or fizzle out if not recast.\n> * Zoe&#x27;s sleep crowd control cannot be cleansed while drowsy, nor will it be resisted by CC-blocking effects applied while drowsy. By contrast, other abilities with two-part crowd control, such as Fizz&#x27;s ult and Morgana&#x27;s ult, have each component treated separately, so that cleansing the first effect removes both, and applying crowd control immunity while the first component is active will grant immunity to the second. Many of these abilities are on a much larger cooldown than Sleepy Trouble Bubble, and typically represent a larger part of the champion&#x27;s power budget that can be cleansed or resisted, as well as a higher measure of risk to said champion while applying it.\n> * Zoe will still blink back to her original location if she is immobilized in the middle of her ult. This goes against all forms of mobility that do not involve dragging a champion to a fixed point (such as Jarvan or Nautilus&#x27;s Qs), as immobilizing crowd control stops the user from benefiting from mobility applied after the immobilize while it persists. The only other exception to this rule, in which Ryze could benefit from his own ult while still in stasis, has just been removed. This special immunity also does not feel appropriate on an ability that is meant to force a measure of risk upon Zoe, by temporarily placing her closer to her opponents and thereby putting her at risk of getting caught.\n> \n> More than just the special-casing for Zoe specifically, what annoys me most is the lack of consistency: if being able to recast an ability while silenced or not being able to cleanse her two-part CC properly are justified, that&#x27;s fine, but then seeing how there are many more champions for whom that same special-casing would be equally, if not more justified, then they should benefit from these developments as well. In the end, it would be fine if either Zoe were brought in line by having her special-casing removed, or if every other champion with the same mechanics benefited from the same updates; the main problem now, which is harming clarity and generating player frustration, is the inconsistency between her own rules and everyone else&#x27;s.\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"Rabblerouser","date":"2018-01-28T18:37:51.566+0000","up_votes":73,"down_votes":8,"body":"Why can Zoe instantly throw her powerful CC right in front of her if a champ gets up in her no-no zone...\n... but {{champion:136}} Aurelion Sol can't instantly recast his Q until it's OUT of his no-no zone?\n\n(No, really, I'm actually really angry about this.)","replies":[{"poster":"TheGoomyGamer","date":"2018-01-28T20:03:37.434+0000","up_votes":38,"down_votes":2,"body":"Probably because Aurelion Sol has a lot of emphasis put on his 'No-No Zone' and him being incredibly weak when his enemies get within it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2018-01-28T20:47:26.893+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":3,"body":"Because Aurelion Sol would be be almost literally impossible for melee champions to fight otherwise.\n\nThink of it this way.
