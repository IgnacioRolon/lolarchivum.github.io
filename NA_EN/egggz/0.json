My initial problem was that I could go into the champion selection and start the game, but during the loading phase I would get a bugsplat error and I tried multiple things all the way up to uninstalling the program and reinstalling. After the re-installation part of my adventuring through these problems, I finally got it downloaded properly, but the problem I'm encountering now is that I'm in the legacy client. No problem right? wrong.... I click launch then i get an error telling me to uninstall and download the ALPHA client. I thought that was the legacy client???? I guess i thought wrong.. well I click the window to download the beta, a small window opens up asking me if i wanna download/ agree to the terms. I hit yes. The window disappears and nothing happens. No problem right?, just go back to the window try to download agian, well now it's telling me that ive already went and downloaded the client and now i cant find anywhere, not even a third-party to download it from. If anyone wants to assist me that would be GREATLY appreciated because i want to play league so bad...","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-14T22:19:11.503+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I took a look at your ticket and it looks like you *just* received a reply from your assigned tech specialist.
