{"poster":"Not Surrendering","date":"2016-12-17T03:40:38.688+0000","title":"Anivia in 7.1","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":82,"down_votes":18,"body":"Hey all, thought I'd hop in for a chat about where Anivia's ended up after the changes. \n\nOverall, we&#039;re pretty happy with where Anivia has landed after the changes in 6.23. \n\nTo refresh, we first undertook these changes for several reasons: \n\n_**Reward vs Counterplay**_\nReward for ER was very high for pretty low counterplay. If we continue to support ER being powerful (where the only meaningful play is to stay out of range), it means we have less power budget to make the rest of her kit cool and powerful. \n\nIn the context of the changes, we wanted to play up the combo aspects of Anivia. \n- Wall -&gt; R, then Q the side when they try to get out -&gt; empowered E should feel powerful and worth the mana cost. \n- Putting down a storm on them when they go for a minion -&gt; walling/Q&#039;ing them into it -&gt; empowered E should also feel worth and powerful. \n- Even R -&gt; E should be OK, but you shouldn&#039;t expect to outtrade people as well as previously. It&#039;s tuned so that unless the opponent is greedy and stands in it for half a second too long, you won&#039;t be able to get an empowered E off without using at least one other ability. \n\nObviously this can cost a lot of mana in lane, but we like that Anivia builds mana and can support these costs. (She also has high base mana and mana regen and can take some points in meditation if you want to go for a lot of trades) As the game goes on, mana costs become less relevant, as your mana costs are a smaller and smaller proportion of your mana pool. If she needed buffs, I would say that we would look to improve the reward she gets for landing her combo, so that she is more incentivised to contest minions with big trades. \n\nI also expect that at higher MMR&#039;s, the ability to throw down R and be a &quot;waveclear bot&quot; without getting pressured off the wave becomes harder, so I&#039;m not too worried about her turning into that (it&#039;s not a winning playstyle) and I fully believe that an aggressive Anivia&#039;s laning is both effective and necessary in a lot of matchups (unless you want to give up a lot of CS). Her trades still hit very hard in laning phase, there&#039;s no question about that. \n\n_**Playing up the Controller/Disruptor**_\nBy our [class definitions](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/gameplay/dev-blog-classes-subclasses), Anivia has the kit pieces to be the quintessential disruptor. \n\nWe want disruptors to have good sustained lockdown, sustained damage and good counter engage and pick potential (think Zyra root and ult, Orianna ult, Anivia wall and storm). \n\nWith the old storm at 3 seconds to ramp up, it was generally too unreliable to access and the reward was pretty low for how difficult it was to get empowered storm to actually hit people (in most cases). \n\nWall is one of the most unique and powerful spells in the game and was on an overly restrictive cooldown at 25 seconds (without a cooldown rankup), so reducing this made a lot of sense. The cooldown is also in the range where you can opt to go for two different builds (CDR predominant build with wall at 10-12 seconds CD for lots of walls/stuns or the 0 cdr mana/burst build). \n\nBy loading more power into the storm (making empowered storm happen earlier) and wall, we can play up the controller aspects a lot more. This power has to come from somewhere, so we took it from the ER, which as I mentioned earlier had game health problems and was an inhibitor to making the rest of her kit more functional and powerful. \n\n_**General Performance**_\nOur internal metrics have been showing Anivia performing well after aggregating for all regions and for our [target audience](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/xwOObpq2-live-gameplay-qa-issue-1-feat-feralpony-smashgizmo). Our changes targeted her laning strength being down (she will be more vulnerable in some matchups) and her late game strength being improved. \n\nShe now exhibits this behaviour with more of a scaling curve (increases over game time), rather than a snowball curve (spikes very hard early and drops sharply). \n\nAnivia is still a very difficult champion to play (she is in the top 10 for mastery curves) and as such, we still expect her to continue to improve slightly (but not hugely) over time (new builds will emerge and her playstyle has been pretty heavily shaken up). As such, we have decided not to buff her for 7.1 and generally think she&#039;s in a pretty good spot (she is in the top 30% for overall winrates and experienced players are finding a lot of success on her.)\n\nHowever, keep in mind that she is a champion that is mained heavily with a steep mastery curve, so this will skew winrates upwardly (experienced plays are a larger proportion of her total plays [compared to Syndra] and she improves much more by game [compared to Shyvana]). All things considered, I think it would be a mistake to rush into a buff and we would almost certainly regret it later. \n\n_**Anivia for 7.1**_\n- We will be adding a &quot;flash forming&quot; effect for both her base and blackfrost storms. \n- Fixing a bug where Empowered Storm usually takes 1.75 seconds to form instead of 1.5 seconds (this is technically a small buff). \n\nSo just wanted to give my thoughts on where we&#039;re at; always open to having a good discussion.","replies":[{"poster":"LankPants","date":"2016-12-17T03:53:40.508+0000","up_votes":30,"down_votes":4,"body":"Oddly specific thread but I like it.

That buy itself is completely and totally unfair. What other mid laner is expected to use all their abilities to trade.  You've effectively made it so if anivia wants to deal any type of damage she has to all in.  Your suggestion for trades as anivia at level 6  is to unleash everything  for approximately  335 mana every time you want to trade for a little over 500 points of damage, This of course while your lane opponent can do approximately half the damage at a third or less of what it cost you  all while maintaining their  other spells in rotation . This true with every other mid laner other than anivia .\n\nAnivia's combo nature makes her naturally made her less efficient for damage and mana at the cost of her reliability, you took away the reliability but  in no shape or form did you up her efficiency in any way. She always has to use 2 spells for 1 person for damage thats not much greater than  her opponents  spells. I find this especially problematic simply because now her initial damage in teams and any fight to be honest is halved at least for the first couple of seconds, its not back ended its just reduced in half.  \n\nAlso the intial 75 cost for her ult is no longer inlane especially at the reduced initial damage and range that it currently , if nothing else please set it to the current toggle amount. \n\nNo Anivia player begged for this empowered damage from her ult that been forced in our faces, because of how quickly our ult gets shut down by some what compent teams, especially now that its damage is half of what it used to be for the first couple of seconds in a fight and its inability to trigger E double damage for the same period of time. You threw everything about her into what is easily the most easily countered part of her kit. One need not even interupt the ult but merely be able to  out of it with in that 2 second period and she;s damn near useless for what appears to be another 5 seconds if your running max cdr.\n\nIn addition can we stop pretending that Anivia is this amazing wave clear God that clears super fast. The only thing noticable about her clears, is its fairly safe a neutral or defensive postion. There actual speed of those clears and the mana cost do not make her clears particularly amazing like the glory days of season 2 . Currently many of the other mids can clear just as fast and at a much lower mana burden then anivia.\n\nAnivia W is also situational, you simply can't use it in every fight, its power is extremely subjective depending on where your fighting if you are enaging or being engaged on.\n\nThe removal of the Q E Q combo and your unwillingness to bring it back just makes matters worse, Your now forced to use you E on what ever unit gets stunned  despite having you Q go through a better choice of target this in both in team fights and wave clearing. \n\nAnivia lack of popularity is probably the only reason  theres any success on her. Most are too unsure of her abilities and skills to even know the proper way to deal with her.","replies":[{"poster":"WickdOwl","date":"2016-12-17T18:03:15.881+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"Logged in to vote this up.

I mean, you got within 600 units of a Mage with all of their CD's up.  What do you think is going to happen?  600 units is an average range at best, and let's face it - It's not like Anivia is going to be closing the gap on you.  And hell, where is the Annie counterplay then?  Annie's range is practically the same as Anivia's E but she's not burdened by ramp-up time for a trade...\n\nI could see them tie E's bonus damage on chilled targets to ult ranks and adjust the base damage/ratio accordingly, but the way it was handled feels like a straight knee-capping.  It's not fun or interesting, it's a liability stemming from unreliability which very few champions can actually afford.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Mitsuki","date":"2016-12-19T21:06:00.708+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"I know you are upset with the changes, I was to initially and was going to find a new One trick champion.

The 500 damage was from everything clouding 3 seconds of ult ticking. \n\nThe problem is with anivia you were never really doing Big Damage, you were doing roughly the same damage as other mids but the damage was more reliable. That came at the cost of a large chunk of mana and using multiple spells. And I admit the raw damage of E R was unfair once you had enough mana.

Which means that for champions that can stay out of that range and poke her freely, she feels utterly helpless and is relegated to a waveclear bot to stave off pushes and concede every fight until her team is also reasonably fed from the stalling.\n\nThe only possible outcomes here are that either she counters someone hard or she is countered hard.\n\nKeep in mind that in order for her to do damage, players now have to stand longer in her ult, which is her reliable damage output. Anivia players have to find ways to make that happen (like her REWQ combo). She isn't a \"tag n' click\" champion that wins every fight with ER.

If we continue to support ER being powerful (where the only meaningful play is to stay out of range), it means we have less power budget to make the rest of her kit cool and powerful.\"\n\nIndeed, her reward for e r was high compared to what you had to do to get it. ( Basicaly getting in range without getting cced) \n\nBut now we are left with a combo that is easily countered ( some champs just need one spell of either cc or dash, and they have 1.3 seconds to use it ) by most champs that is in fact dealing less dmg than bevore ( ult dmg down the first 2.5 seconds and e base dmg down. ) \nHer e r was basicaly turned from being high dmg and low counterplay, to high counterplay and slightly less dmg.\n\nIt is nice of you to say that you want to have that powerbudget for her other spells, but so far her powerwas mostly taken and not put elsewhere. We are left overall weaker with less dmg for harder plays. \n\nI understand why you would do that change if you in fact would have compensated her elsewhere, but the wall and minimal e cdr buff just won't cut it. It is nice for a supporter to have, but anivia is not a supporter. \n\nAnd now you say that the one Qol Change we could have seen in the near future is not going to be implemented either. You say that you want to buff the rest of her kit for what was taken from her, but it did not happenso far and you also state that you guys/girls are happy with how anivia is right now. I do not see how those statements could get along. Please explain if you are actualy planning to give that powerbudget back to her other spells. I would appreciate it. \n\n>\"In the context of the changes, we wanted to play up the combo aspects of Anivia.\n- Wall -> R, then Q the side when they try to get out -> empowered E should feel powerful and worth the mana cost.\n- Putting down a storm on them when they go for a minion -> walling/Q'ing them into it -> empowered E should also feel worth and powerful.\n- Even R -> E should be OK, but you shouldn't expect to outtrade people as well as previously. It's tuned so that unless the opponent is greedy and stands in it for half a second too long, you won't be able to get an empowered E off without using at least one other ability.\"\n\nI fully support your idea of playing her combo aspect up, as it is what anivia always has been.\n\nBut none of those combos are easy to pull off, they are neither reliable, nor are they that rewarding. ( We lost dmg after all on all spells instead of getting it back  or raised for such hard tasks.) If we fail one of our abilities, the whole reward is gone. And our mana is still used. \n\nYou did manage to play her combo aspect up, but it is not because it is rewarding anivia to do so, but it is the only way she can work at all in case you succeed. Unlike most other mages, she is forced to go all out, while her enemies can trade and holding on to an ability that can save them in case something bad happens. \n\nAfter all, empowered e does not feel worth and powerful for what we had to do to get it. \n\n>\"Obviously this can cost a lot of mana in lane, but we like that Anivia builds mana and can support these costs. (She also has high base mana and mana regen and can take some points in meditation if you want to go for a lot of trades) As the game goes on, mana costs become less relevant, as your mana costs are a smaller and smaller proportion of your mana pool. If she needed buffs, I would say that we would look to improve the reward she gets for landing her combo, so that she is more incentivised to contest minions with big trades.\"\n\nIt takes a long time for the manaitems she buys to get effective. While most other mages build ap straight away, she is still trying to get her manadrain under control. This has always been an aspect of her, which is why I played her with clarity until it was removed from the Summoners Rift. Today I do not think it is still necessary to do that, but her manadrain still exceeds that of most other mages, is harder to use effectively and gives less or the same reward. \n\nThat you would improve her reward for landing a combo is definetly something I would support. But contesting minions? This is not a PvE game :P Doing big trades sounds more like it. \n\n>\"I also expect that at higher MMR's, the ability to throw down R and be a \"waveclear bot\" without getting pressured off the wave becomes harder, so I'm not too worried about her turning into that (it's not a winning playstyle) and I fully believe that an aggressive Anivia's laning is both effective and necessary in a lot of matchups (unless you want to give up a lot of CS). Her trades still hit very hard in laning phase, there's no question about that.\"\n\nTbh, she is not going to be the waveclear bot some players try to make us believe. But more often than not, doing that is the best option anivia will have. Sadly, this aspect of her is weak compared to a lot of other champs. One will notice that in case two champs, one anivia and the other one being any other champ, that anivia will not get a lot of that farm herself. WIth the way her ult was changed she is slower in clearing waves. The average adc will clear waves faster than her later into the game. \n\nWhy everyone is believeing that she is getting a waveclear bot is, because they think that her trading her opponent wont work now most of the time. This is true for higher elo, and thus you are right. But she won't be able to trade, nor will she be able to waveclear.  Getting behind with anivia know is a devastating experience I already had to face a few times against syndra and ahri, and getting ahead is underwhelming and unrewarding, as your enemies still have it quite save against her now, even when she is fed. \n\n>\"By our class definitions, Anivia has the kit pieces to be the quintessential disruptor.\n\n>\"We want disruptors to have good sustained lockdown, sustained damage and good counter engage and pick potential (think Zyra root and ult, Orianna ult, Anivia wall and storm).\"\n\n>\"With the old storm at 3 seconds to ramp up, it was generally too unreliable to access and the reward was pretty low for how difficult it was to get empowered storm to actually hit people (in most cases).\"\n\nShe sure sounds like a disruptor, even though this part: \n\n>\"Disruptors specialize in locking down opponents or, in some cases, entire battlefields by creating intense zones of threat that only foolish enemies would dare wade through.\"\n\nIs no longer realy true. I can tell you from experience in my last couble games, that more and more champs start to disrepect anivias ult and zoning, simply walking through it like it never existed. Zyra is doing a better job in this than anivia.  Also this sounds a lot more like a Support than a mage. I did not mind back when zyra was also a mid mage, but now she is a support mainly and anivia seems to drift in the same direction, especialy with how that definition is phrased. \n\nWe had a instant full size ult for the longest time, but that was deemed unhealthy for the game. If you want to argue about this change buffing her ult, than you would also have to adress her in that aspect, which leaves her still weaker in my eyes. \n\nThe part about her 3 second ult ramp up time being unreliable for how difficult it was is btw. how her whole kit and ability inteactions feel for me now. None of it is safe, none of it is easy to use and the reward is underwhelming for the effort in most cases. \n\n>\"Wall is one of the most unique and powerful spells in the game and was on an overly restrictive cooldown at 25 seconds (without a cooldown rankup), so reducing this made a lot of sense. The cooldown is also in the range where you can opt to go for two different builds (CDR predominant build with wall at 10-12 seconds CD for lots of walls/stuns or the 0 cdr mana/burst build).\"\n\nWall is a spell without any dmg and other effect besides blocking the way. It is not that unique ( Taliyah ult, yarvan ult etc. ) and is outclassed by abilities that block a path for being dangerous by themself if intruded. ( Rumble ult, cassio miasma, veigar stun cage) \n\nDo not get me wrong, it is a good ability, but only in combination with her other spells or a team to make us of it. This is even more true if you play her support, but as mage (disruptor, mind you) she has to work well by herself as well. Pushing her power into her utility alone will leave her weak for what she is supposed to do as well, and that is damage.\n\n>\"By loading more power into the storm (making empowered storm happen earlier) and wall, we can play up the controller aspects a lot more. This power has to come from somewhere, so we took it from the ER, which as I mentioned earlier had game health problems and was an inhibitor to making the rest of her kit more functional and powerful.\"\n\nThe storm is weaker in dmg. The utility of that spell was buffed but not the damage. We went through the math a couple times and it is weaker until 2.5 seconds, in which it will go even with the complete dmg it has done. Prior to that point, her dmg was nerfed yet again for utility. The only scenario it will be more effective besides time is, when someone is moving in the ult after you placed it 1.5 seconds ago. \n\n It was not more power loaded into her ult, but instead her ult utility got buffed for a decrease in early damage. This change could have also happened without changing the e r. With how the er interaction got changed though, it was necessary to shift power inside the ult, or it would have no longer been viable. \n\nSo in my book, no power was shifted from the interaction to the ult. All we got as compensation was the lower cd on w and e, and that is again buffing her utility over her damage. \n\n(Part 2 follows)","replies":[{"poster":"Anìvìa","date":"2016-12-17T15:24:38.040+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Omg, I just errased the whole second part by accident ...

Our changes targeted her laning strength being down (she will be more vulnerable in some matchups) and her late game strength being improved.\"\n\nI can not realy say anything about internal data, as I do not have the option to see them myself. All i can look at is, are externel websites that use your data ( lower sample size of the same data is bound to small errors) \nAnd those show 51% winrates on bronze to plat+, while maintaining 48.7% on dia+. As your target audience according to the link seems to be plat +, dia would be falling under the category as well. And considering how few players do play her, that is anything but strong. What I can give you credit for is,that her winrate recovered since the patch overall. \n\n\n\n\n>\"Anivia is still a very difficult champion to play (she is in the top 10 for mastery curves) and as such, we still expect her to continue to improve slightly (but not hugely) over time (new builds will emerge and her playstyle has been pretty heavily shaken up). As such, we have decided not to buff her for 7.1 and generally think she's in a pretty good spot (she is in the top 30% for overall winrates and experienced players are finding a lot of success on her.)\"\n\nI do not think that we can expect more diversity in builds. ( Not without touching completly new roles like jungle that is) \nWe already tested around for over a month, and so far we got a few new builds(redemption), masteries ( DFT and cdr over pen and burst) and runes out of it. ( A lot of cdr/level) \nFokus on lane and in fights shifted. There might be something we have not tried so far ( We aniviaplayers got lower in numbers after all, so less testing in general) \nbut that is unlikely. \n\nExperienced players might find success on her, but it is not as high as most of us would have expected, and definetly lower than what we have to put in for it. You see, if someone would spent 100+ games into a champ, he would expect to be on paar with champions that need equal experience to be played in the best way possible. With anivia, that reward is rather underwhelming. Someone would have more fun with a champ, who needs less time to learn, but offers the same depth, fun and strength. Or they switch to a champ that needs that experience, but will reward the player by performing exceptionaly well. Anivia lacks the strength she would need to justify such a mastery curve. \n\nMost of those players you mentioned are playing her mostly, because they have been mains for so long, that they would rather deal with the missing strength rather than learning a new champ alltogether. If you want to make her more popular, increasing her skillfloor for a lower reward then before seems rather counterintuitive in that regard. \n\n>\"However, keep in mind that she is a champion that is mained heavily with a steep mastery curve, so this will skew winrates upwardly (experienced plays are a larger proportion of her total plays [compared to Syndra] and she improves much more by game [compared to Shyvana]). All things considered, I think it would be a mistake to rush into a buff and we would almost certainly regret it later.\"\n\nDo not rush buffs. Sure, we do not want to commute between strong and weak either. Thats why you changed her er interaction in the first place, but small scale changes like reverting the e base dmg nerf are definetly something you could consider already. Your phrasing implies, that we would have to wait 3 month and more after the patch to actualy see you considering small buffs that should have been thought through bevore changing her. Her playrate was sitting at 3%, so you had a lot of time to think her update through. Anivia players mostly feel robbed of strength in almost every aspect of hers. \n\nWhat you describe with Syndra and Shyvana here is what I mentioned in my text above the quote i just refer to.\n\n>\"Anivia for 7.1\n- We will be adding a \"flash forming\" effect for both her base and blackfrost storms.\n- Fixing a bug where Empowered Storm usually takes 1.75 seconds to form instead of 1.5 seconds (this is technically a small buff).\"\n\nNot understanding the first change. The bugfix sounds rather nice,though.  It sounds like it was necessary to keep someone in the ult for 2 seconds instead of the 1.5 second to to get the empowered e, but that could be wrong. \n\n>\"So just wanted to give my thoughts on where we're at; always open to having a good discussion.\"\n\nSame, fizz. After all I do not need high winratio on her, nor do I want her to be picked by a large amount of players.

I'm tired of people saying that her old E>R combo had no counterplay. Yes if you are talking about counterplay as in \"avoidable\" then it's true because you couldn't avoid her old E>R combo but you can take advantage after she used it, which no one really did. \n\nDuring the lane phase which is what most people had a problem with the combo, her E>R combo would do about half of your health..Then after that she has to wait another 7 or so seconds until she can re-use her ultimate which players should of took the advantage of and jumped on her...When her R and E are both on CD, the only thing she has is her easily dodgable Q, her Wall and auto attacks. Considering she just hit you with her E>R combo, she is within like 600-700 range of you which is short enough for most of the mid lane match--ups to follow up and burst her down, because what are you afraid of? Her Auto attacks which has the second worst/slowest animation in the game? Instead of jumping on her when her main skills were on CD, people would get scared and backed off and then complain about the damage.\n\nSpeaking of damage, her E wasn't even super OP anyways. Yes it was un-avoidable but you want to know another Un-avoidable high burst basic skill? {{champion:112}}'s Q. If you count up both proc's of his Q's damage its almost higher than Anivia, while being a standalone skill which doesn't require the use of another skill (like an ultimate..), way less mana, roughly the same range, gives a shield, gives movement speed,  about as little counterplay (point-click, then auto attack) and how well it synergies with {{item:3285}} {{item:3100}} both of which aren't that good on Anivia.\n\nMax {{champion:34}}  E: 300 + 100% AP (600 Range, 90 Mana)\nMax {{champion:112}} Q (Both proc): 240 + 90% AP + 100% AD (8% Max Mana + 15%AP Shield) (600 Range, 65 Mana)\nA Viktor at level 9 would have base 72 AD so basically it's 312 + 90% AP at that point. So wheres all the hate about that doing to much damage? And both Viktor and Anivia are control mages so it's not like I'm comparing her to an assassin or something...And Viktor doesn't suffer from any of Anivia's weaknesses which is a lot (I'd even say she might have one of the most weaknesses in the game), Viktor's weaknesses are basically like Delay in some of his Abilities and no form of dash and that's basically it.\n\nThough as I said before, the changes weren't bad and I'm not trying to complain about what happened to Anivia, I'm only saying this to say I really find it annoying to see people pretending that her old R>E combo was so OP and needed to be removed and yet don't take advantage of it when they fight it in lane. I've faced Anivia enough times in lane and I've always won against her, she is rather easy to beat once you know her kit and how to fight her.\n\nAs for how I deal with the changes? With the reduced CD on her wall and E I've been running scaling CDR glyphs and getting {{item:3165}} as my 3rd item, after {{item:3040}} {{item:3027}} of course. Thanks for making this thread btw, sorry if this kind of went into a rant but I've seen a lot of threads talking about her and I was basically holding in my thoughts and decided to just put it in here then to talk in countless other threads.","replies":[{"poster":"Kingnewgameplus","date":"2016-12-17T06:59:07.255+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"People don't bitch about vik's q because they're too busy complaining about his E.","replies":[]},{"poster":"HazyCloud7","date":"2016-12-18T04:56:12.274+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Conveniently forgot to mention viktor's auto on the Q requires you to be in 525 range of him.
