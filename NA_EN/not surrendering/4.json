That's not applicable for just about any other mage.\n\n* Brand doesn't buy mana items because he absolutely has to get Liandrys and Rylais ASAP for his spells to do anything, not because he doesn't want to.\n\n* Annie, Diana, Ekko, Fizz, and LB just don't use spells the same way as the primary users of mana items. They are all burst-focused, kill-focused, all-in champions. Annie isn't throwing out spells at the same rate as a Ziggs, Xerath, Viktor, Vel'Koz, Syndra, etc who are the primary mage mana users. Diana, Fizz, and LB even less so. Ekko throws out Q but it does so little damage compared to poke from actual mages that it isn't comparable. If Ekko Q did damage like Xerath Q, he would be built very differently. This is also true for Diana Q. Don't think these are the champions that should be the poster-children of a mana system designed for Cassiopeia, Xerath, and Veigar.\n\nThis approach would require radically redesigning kits on a **lot** of mages (Ryze again? bleugh) and fundamentally changing playstyles. This is not an attractive option at all for me as a mage player of Malzahar, Ziggs, and Viktor.\n\n> **Strategy Two**: Retaining mana as a required early purchase and create contextual choices for this purchase (involves figuring out what these statlines and uniques look like). \n> \n> - Considerations in this space can be tough, because Morellonomicon gives mages a lot of the stats they could want and so the result of making the slot more contextual can make the purchase feel bad (just give me my old item back) or result in power creep.

But the system has to have multiple choices for each class of mage. The system laid out in the mid season mage update was \"Tear is for spell spammers, RoA is for battle mages, Morello is for here-and-now\". The problem is that Tear isn't an item that makes any sense to build on most mages since plenty of mages can't stack it at all (Tear Viktor?). That leaves RoA and Morello and RoA gives health which isn't attractive to a lot of mages and even those that may like health don't necessarily want to ever opt in to a super-delayed scaling build. That leaves Morello as the only possible choice, not just the best one. \n\nMages need multiple **normal** mana items. Not items that are unbuildable or incredibly niche. Flat mana items without gimmicks on the mana itself. If my only options to get to work 20 miles away are drive, bike, or walk , it shouldn't be surprising that I'll drive every time. That doesn't mean that driving is OP. It means that biking and walking aren't even feasible options. The contextual choices needed in the system need to have in mind states of the world where it is even feasible for a mage to build different items. There was never a state of the world where it would ever be desirable to build Tear on Viktor instead of Morello, even if the stats on Tear/Seraph's  were tuned way up.\n\nAs an aside, I don't find power creep concerns compelling, given how bad mid lane feels now with the game feeling like a function of only how bot does. It is hard to hear \"power creep\" when other roles are still ahead and haven't been pushed down.\n\n> Separate from this larger project, also looking into some smaller scope improvements: \n> \n> - Looking at ways to improve the Void/Deathcap multiplier split choice.

Mages need some sort of multiplier to separate them from AP Assassins just like ADCs have Crit to separate them from AD Assassins. But this is probably beyond the scope of these changes.","replies":[{"poster":"TheMeta88","date":"2017-11-09T15:10:54.295+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"P-P-P-P-P-PREACH!

All three paradigms use mana differently, so there should be different items that address the needs of each while accentuating the strengths of that paradigm. Below are some different ideas for items that attempt various ways at covering these specific mana needs.\n\n_All items have mana, I'm simply listing the main differences between the items._\n\n___\n\n**BURST:** Wants to unload all spells at once on a primary target. No real need for CDR to accomplish their task. Doesn't need consistent mana restoration the way other paradigms do.\n\n{{item:3165}} high AP (100-120ish), no CDR, %mana restored on kill with a short CD.\nHigh AP to kill a priority target, get mana back on kill, rinse repeat to do again shortly. Mana restore doesn't support extended spell casting or trading patterns.\n\n_OR_\n\n{{item:3030}} high AP and burst, no CDR, health, Eternity passive (or maybe %mana on kill here as well).\nCould be an option if you want health as a mid-range burst mage (I'm not completely sold on the stats and passives for this iteration, though).\n\n___\n\n**POKE:** Wants to chip away at health bars over time. Needs a bit of CDR to function properly. Needs some form of mana restoration to poke effectively.\n\n{{item:3285}} moderate AP (80-100ish), 10% CDR, mana restored on passive proc _on champions_.\nMid-lane version of Runic Echoes. User is rewarded for landing spells on enemies, while enemies have counterplay by avoiding Luden's procs to eventually make them go oom. Lower AP is less effective for full burst champions, and mana restoration isn't as effective when spamming spells in quick succession.\n\n_OR_\n\n{{item:3003}} with {{item:3151}} burn passive added. Moderate AP, 10% CDR, mana restored based on %current hp damage (most effective for poking).\n\n___\n\n**DPS:** Wants to be in the thick of the fight dealing damage. Relies more on spell cooldowns and base damage to pump out DPS. Needs a lot of mana restoration to cast spells until the enemy is dead.\n\n{{item:3027}} low AP (60-80ish, scales to 80-100ish), 10% CDR that scales to 20% CDR, scaling health, Eternity passive or mana restored based on dealing damage (capped?).\nScaling item for late game DPS mages. Gives the most CDR at the cost of being a weaker item early game. Also gives health so the champion is tanky enough to  live longer and deal DPS since they're most likely mid/low range. Mana restored based on dealing damage is better for low cost, spammable spells but less effective on high cost spells that burst and poke champions have.\n\n___\n\nThose are my initial thoughts. I have no idea if those items are broken or trash, how they affect niche cases of champions, or what components or additional passives they would have. I'm mainly thinking of how the final items, their stats and their mana restoration effects, cater to the different paradigms of AP/mana users and their specific ways of using mana.\n\nI could be completely off base, but hopefully not.\n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Linna Excel","date":"2017-11-09T20:00:14.707+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"I'd prefer the first strategy.  My big problem with mana as a early purchase is the {{item:3070}} issue: your damage is crap in the early game compared to someone who comes back with a {{item:1037}} or {{item:1026}}.  I mean what's the point of having more mana if the other guy can just blow you up before you can use it all?  Also if you get a tear, you wind up with too much mana on most champs but that's an item specific issue.  For a champ with an early to mid powerspike, you've basically wasted your advantage because you didn't get the damage when you need it.  Then you end up falling off faster.\n\nIf you did go with the second strategy, I don't think you should go with a bigger mana pool.  I think you'd be better off with items like {{item:3003}}, specifically for the refund and not the numbers.  Morello's conditional mana refund is also fine.  That said, I've never liked the catalyst line of items for either healing or mana.  In genernal I'd prefer more mana regen or refunds than a bigger mana.  The other problem I have with the larger mana pool is once you cast spells that have a total mana more than it, it's basically wasted stat from that point on until you base.\n\n>Looking at ways to improve the Void/Deathcap multiplier split choice. (This could be as simple as buffing Deathcap). \n\nI think Dcap needs more than just a simple buff:\n\n1. It's too expensive\n2. AP ratios are crap overall compared to AD ratios\n3. It's bonus is crap compared to critical strikes, this becomes important when you see the damage multiplier that IE gives, but Dcap fails to compete with.\n4. Dcap can't be rushed while IE can be (this should be your biggest clue that Dcap is fundementally broken).\n5. Games are so fast that they end before you can finish the Dcap even if you wanted it.  Why?  No one rushes Dcap.\n6. Void Staff gives so much Mpen it completely undervalues Dcap's bonus.  This is in part to AP ratios being crap\n7. It doesn't give anything not AP.  There's no mana.  There's no movespeed.  There's no omnivamp or sheen effects.  There's no Mpen.  There's no health or armor or MR so I don't get burst down.  More AP alone isn't worth it anymore.\n8. If you run out of mana, having more AP is useless.  Why?  No one buys nashor's.  Dcap needs you to have a steady supply of mana to begin with.\n9.

Players have to conserve their spells on a mage while an ADC can right click all day.\n\nI think Dcap is always going to be an inferior option because Void Staff gives you more damage for less money.

The entire tree is almost non-existant. {{item:3285}} is too generalist and stat-weak. {{item:3003}} is too expensive and takes too long to spike. {{item:3089}} is just a mess; takes to many components to build, costs too much and it's passive is way overtuned.\n\nThere is also clear up issues with items like the {{item:3145}} line, and other utility lines such as {{item:3030}} {{item:3116}} {{item:3151}} {{item:3157}} giving oddball amounts of stats.\n\nPotential solutions would be:\n\n* Give {{item:3027}} the damage aura of {{item:3001}}  when you reach full stacks. With a minor cost increase you would again have a scaling item for battle mages and mid range burst mages and give Abyssal a new passive. Tanks have no right to get a tank item with such a utility/damage option on top of it.\n\n* {{item:3285}} should deal increased damage based on distance from the caster. Cimenting this as a poke based item, instead of a worse {{item:3087}}.\n\n* {{item:3070}} should work more like {{item:1083}}...farm minions (125 to 150 maybe) to stack it up is alot less clunky than the spell rotation system it currently has and it becomes easier to gauge how far/close it is to fully stack.\n\n* {{item:3089}} just reduce the passive AP gain to 25%, reduce the cost by 200-250 gold and make a mini version that builds into it like {{item:3076}} or {{item:3077}} and gives 10-15% increased AP. This way you could fuel back AP into individual items and make pre-Deathcap purchases not feel as bad.\n\n* {{item:3145}} line needs clean up: {{item:3030}} needs a niche of it's own, otherwise it will always be overshadowed by {{item:3116}}. {{item:3146}} needs to have it's AD removed and be focused into another role. {{item:3152}} is ok for the most part, maybe just requires a minor stat buff.\n\n* EDIT: Another idea to deal with {{item:3165}}  would be to not _only_ add new options to the tree (like converting {{item:3100}} into a {{item:3802}} upgrade), but also remove the GW passive in favour of doubling down on it's mana reset passive. \n\n* EDIT2: Another idea would be to give {{item:3135}} the same treatment that created the {{item:3035}} {{item:3033}} {{item:3036}} line. One mid tier lesser version that upgrades into one that gives the GW passive and another that would give the {{item:3151}} bleed passive. That would also open up Magic pen options and focus AP itemization to tank busting options, removing the current overlap that {{item:3151}} gives.","replies":[]},{"poster":"YumaS2Astral","date":"2017-11-09T07:36:13.840+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=PhRoXz0n,realm=NA,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=iUVP7wMV,comment-id=,timestamp=2017-11-09T01:20:01.319+0000)\n> \n> - Making Mejais a more reasonable option to opt into rather than just a smurf stomping option (making a fully stacked dark seal more reasonable to upgrade). \n\nI don't think this is a good thing - Mejai is an unhealthy and binary item that promotes snowballing, and this game is already very snowbally.

Armor and Health and MR make you durable, which feels great. Lifesteal and Health Regen keep you in lane with sustain. AD, AP, CDR, AS, and Crit make numbers big. MS is immediately appreciable.\n\nMana though? It's the mechanic you really only notice when you run out, and then you have to back -- not in the exciting, low-health way of \"I survived. So glad I built that extra defense,\" but more in the \"well, I could keep going, but I can't really DO anything. Wheeeeee.\" Short of super major cooldowns with high impact (Blitzcrank hook comes to mind) that are reasonably gated, mana management just isn't that FUN, although, yes, it can be a strategic limiter. I think it's a large part of why many AP items feel underwhelming -- your purchasing power is largely constrained by mana needs, especially if you want to itemize into CDR.\n\nI'd be really interested in seeing mana all but removed from itemization, and seeing if the system can be overhauled to modify the resource to be a little more inherently interesting, or if mana regeneration sources can become interactive strategic choices instead of +mana or +mana regen statically.\n\nOne of my personal thought experiments (obviously super rough) was wondering what would happen if you set all champions with a set mana pool (say, 1500) and adjusted their costs according to the importance of a given ability, with fairly high regen. An example with Blitzcrank might be a rate of 10 mana per second returned, but hook uses 400. His other abilities might only use a fraction of that, letting him stay in lane as long as he's not using his big-ticket spells frequently, but limiting his major plays strategically and still requiring resource management.\n\nNow, I'll admit it's a major adjustment with significant balance ramifications, but I'm interested in your thoughts on the excitement of mana as a mechanic in general.","replies":[{"poster":"LankPants","date":"2017-11-09T06:41:50.788+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">I'm going to make a pitch on why I think this is the area you should explore, and I'm interested to know your thoughts.\n\nHere's a pitch on why it's a bad idea, Zed exists.\n\nRemoving mana options only serves to empower the degenerate playstyle which Zed often opts for where he'll simply wave clear against a mage until they OOM then punish them for something they couldn't feasibly play around.","replies":[{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2017-11-09T13:06:11.692+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=LankPants,realm=OCE,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=iUVP7wMV,comment-id=00020003,timestamp=2017-11-09T06:41:50.788+0000)\n>\n> Here&#x27;s a pitch on why it&#x27;s a bad idea, Zed exists.\n> \n> Removing mana options only serves to empower the degenerate playstyle which Zed often opts for where he&#x27;ll simply wave clear against a mage until they OOM then punish them for something they couldn&#x27;t feasibly play around.\n\nPlease see the rest of the post, which was figuring out ways to enable mana-using champions to always be able to do SOMETHING, at least. :)","replies":[{"poster":"LankPants","date":"2017-11-09T13:13:33.587+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your ideas completely devalue mana management as a skill.\n\nThis line I think epitomises how you misunderstand mana fundamentally.\n\n>Mana though?

Are you seriously considering that as a viable option?\n\n>  create contextual choices for this purchase **(involves figuring out what these statlines and uniques look like). **\n\nStrategy Two, maybe you can consider a \"Catalyst versus Lost Chapter\" general framework, where Mages choose the Mana paradigm that best fit their own patterns, with then various upgrades that specialize a Mage toward a certain goal (Bursting priority targets VS Melting Tanks VS Drain Tanking from the front line, for instance). This would emphasize the importance of items' passives, with the passives bearing most of the \"specialization\" load, and we could get 3 or 4 mana items with a very pattern-defining passive. Think passives similar to Liandry (DPS) vs Lichbane/Hextech (Burst) vs Luden (Poke), but on items built from either Catalyst or Lost Chapter.\n\nSome champs are obviously heavily constrained (Annie will always Burst more than anything else), but some could make choices depending on the state of the game and the enemy team comp (e.g. Ziggs going more for Poke against the enemy frontline versus Burst against the enemy backline) via reactive Item choices.\n\nOne of the big issues with that, though, is where and how do you fit the stacking items Tear and RoA in such a framework.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rivini","date":"2017-11-10T05:43:00.434+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"While there is a glaring issue with AP itemization, it's but one small part of a bigger picture.\n\nThe problems with AP champions (mages especially) are minion farming in the laning phase, having consistent, meaningful damage after it, and severe lack of sustain. Granted some have sustain in their kits, but so do many AD champions, yet they get a plethora of lifesteal and other sustain options anyway.\n\nI don't understand why AD champions are allowed to have strong abilities as well as strong right-clicking, usually trumping what mages can do every less of a second with massive crits, while also negating damage dealt to them through healing in one of many ways on top of it all. How is it fair for AD champions to have so much while mages have to struggle in the laning phase with managing mana and cooldowns since right-clicking for them is a joke? Can't even invest too much in mana items because it would mean limiting your damage potential even further.\n\nRun out of mana and/or getting low on health? Better go all the way back to base while your AD opponent can continue right-clicking minions with ease and not worry about taking any damage. That's certainly fun and engaging gameplay.\nPlaying a mage means either focusing abilities on farming or dealing with the enemy laner. Can't do both like AD champions can.\n\nWhat the game has become makes it discouraging to play mages and most other AP champions. AD champions have way better items **and** much more variety, are inherently stronger because of free right-click power, and Riot themselves appreciate what they do more than mages. More evidence of it is in the new rune system. Look at the subtext for the rune tree made for marks(wo)men: _\"Become a legend.\"_\n\nWhy bother living out the fantasy of playing with magic when it's all about quickly melting all (literally all) of your enemies with fast, critting basic attacks?
