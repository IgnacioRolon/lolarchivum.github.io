Twice.","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Twice in my recent promo series, I would: load into lobby, select a champ, be unable to click on Ban because it wasnt registering it.\r\n\r\nThe timer ends and then a prompt appears saying would I like to stay connected to League of Legends or would I like to Exit Now.\r\n\r\nIt happened once on my first game in my promos so I thought it was a fluke. I managed to win the second game with 0 issues and was looking forward to 3rd game.\r\n\r\nIt happened again. I highly doubt anything can be done about it by Riot for me but I need to at least share the problem. It really sucks to get screwed out of ranking up like this. I dont know what caused the issue. Any help out there would be appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"Darth Acinorev","date":"2017-09-07T08:57:33.150+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"SAME!
