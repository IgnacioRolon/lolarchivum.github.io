I am not sure what I need to do to improve this. I built my computer about 4-5 years ago and am 100% willing to buy new parts to improve my in game experience. I currently run an AMD FX-8320 Eight core processor 8gb of ram 64bit os and a Geforce GT 610 graphics card. Ive updated all drivers. My cpu usage sit around 8% while playing league with no applications open. (I want to be able to record with no lag)  I have taken various steps to help improve my ingame fps but I am still sitting at a low fps while im not even recording. A possibly important note could be that I am currently on Windows 7 but I did a hard drive wipe and lost my genuine copy of windows 7 and am now on a non genuine product key for windows 7. But before I still had the issues so Im not sure if that is effecting anything! Please if you have any idea of what will optimize my in game experience (even if I need to spend some money) please do let me know!\nLinks\nProcessor - https://pcpartpicker.com/product/dmw323/amd-cpu-fd8320frhkbox\nGraphics card - https://www.geforce.com/hardware/desktop-gpus/geforce-gt-610/specifications\n\n#ADCMAIN {{champion:202}} {{champion:29}}","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-23T22:20:19.562+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd say those specs should be running League relatively well imho.
