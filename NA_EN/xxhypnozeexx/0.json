Now we&#039;ll try to patch it up to the latest version.&quot; and then when i press okay it says &quot;There was a problem patching League of Legends. We&#039;ll restore a backup version and try updating again after you restart the patcher.&quot; Then its just an endless loop of that. I&#039;ve the hextech repair tool and still doesn&#039;t work. Is there a way to fix this?","replies":[{"poster":"Ban Yas ","date":"2017-08-11T19:29:42.454+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"im having the same problem any help wpuld be fantastic","replies":[]},{"poster":"Riot Epiphane","date":"2017-05-01T22:30:56.494+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi xXHypnoZeeXx! It would be a huge help if you could provide your League Client logs:\n\n- Go to \"C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Logs\\LeagueClient Logs\\\"\n- Select the latest \"LeagueClient.log\" file\n- Open it using notepad or a similar program\n- Select everything (ctrl + A) and copy it\n- Go to pastebin.com and paste the content there\n- Set the expiration date to 1 week\n- Submit it\n- Share the link here\n\nIn the meantime, you might have some luck running LeagueClient.exe as administrator. Give that a shot!","replies":[]}]}
