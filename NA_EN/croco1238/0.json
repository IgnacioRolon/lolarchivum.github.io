Try using our [**Hextech Repair Tool**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367-Automated-Troubleshooting-Hextech-Repair-Tool) really quickly and make sure to run it with the option **Force Repatch** turned on.\n\nIf that doesn't help we might need to tackle this a little harder. Sometimes the client files get corrupted in such a way that the patch can't quite be fully applied. In these cases, deleting a certain file can force another update which tends to do the trick. If the Hextech Repair Tool hasn't worked, refer to this screenshot for the file to delete and which one you should open, and let me know how this works out for you!\n\nhttps://i.gyazo.com/83442ca9c073cced9b0b2aa18aa32279.png","replies":[]}]}
