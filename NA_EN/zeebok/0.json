It just shows the name of the skin and the rarity of it.

If that's the case, you may need to double check that your client doesn't have any damaged or corrupted files pertaining to the loot menu. I'd try running a quick repair through the client options first, but hit me back up if that doesn't help!","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheViper7911","date":"2017-07-14T00:19:41.900+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Reboot and relog?","replies":[]}]}
