Right now they were doing 100% each soldier so 3 soldiers was 300% damage.","replies":[{"poster":"Lauchmelder","date":"2016-03-10T08:10:28.128+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah, that explains it.

I've seen at least 4 new bugs come up between his W, Q and auto attacks doing no damage. The only thing wrong before was that annoying Q auto bug and fervor, but this is much much worse in my opinion.","replies":[]},{"poster":"1Ferdinand1","date":"2016-03-10T16:51:54.449+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since he have bugs in every patch, have internally been mentioned to totally recode him?","replies":[]}]}]}
