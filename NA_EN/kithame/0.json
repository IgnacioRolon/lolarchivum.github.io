I wrote a ticket to support about it and was told by BigPapaMIDKnight &quot; personally, I think it sounds like a vital feature that should be implemented.&quot; It seems that the support team can&#039;t add that sort of feature and suggest I post about it here. \r\n\r\nI&#039;m all for abusing the heck out of that block button. When I get someone in a game, I mute them, afterwards I block them (after the report if they&#039;re that bad) and move on with my life. But now, I can&#039;t block the flamer that screams they&#039;re going to feed when {{champion:19}}  gets banned and they&#039;re queued for support so they take the mid&#039;s pick with {{summoner:6}} and {{summoner:1}} and scream they&#039;re going to feed all game. (true story) So someone dodges to avoid playing with someone that toxic. Now you run the risk of getting into another game with them or (and I&#039;m not sure if this is true or not but I feel it has an effect) add them to your blocked list so it&#039;s less likely you&#039;ll be paired with them... but to do that, you&#039;d better log out, hop to the old client and add them that way because on the new one you&#039;re out of luck. \r\n\r\nSorry for my ramblings, I just think we need to be freely be able to block someone without playing with them first.

His attitude hadn't changed and by the end of the match everyone was adding him to block and reporting so I call that a win because I knew I'd had a previous bad experience with the player so I was able to remain calm as he began to flame.","replies":[]}]}]}
