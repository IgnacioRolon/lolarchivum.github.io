Therefore, the conflict of interest of the game coding occurred in which it determined Sion to be 'alive' when he was in fact dead.\n\nIt may or may not occur with Karthus as well. The difference is Sion actually has a targetable presence which may be part of the coding of how it works.\n\nUpdate: It just revives Karthus.","replies":[{"poster":"Jinxsterr","date":"2018-12-21T21:39:12.681+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lakrosin,realm=NA,application-id=LqLKtMpN,discussion-id=c8K6eBH3,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2018-12-21T19:16:13.683+0000)\n>\n> Basically the game is coded that he is alive if he is undead.

Definitely needs to be dealt with. Hopefully they will acknowledge it soon.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Dynikus","date":"2018-12-21T19:04:46.099+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"This doesn't seem like something that needs to be hotfixed, as it looks like a pretty specific sequence of events needs to happen.

All you have to do is die before it starts.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhg6x_XwoG4","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2018-12-21T21:44:57.857+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What happened after the video ended?
