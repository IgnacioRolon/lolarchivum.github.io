With his current kit in place, all he can do is go back and forth between broken and trash. Maybe if you fixed his bugs (Alpha strike and feared during it but only runs away after the alpha hits) and etc he wouldn't be a problem anymore. You know...\n\nThe bugs you ignored for years?\n\nKinda like how you can hit someone at the last millisecond and not cancel their recall?\n\nIt either breaks him or 'breaks' him.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-06-21T03:54:02.536+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yi cannot be balanced.\n\nHe needs to be deleted and replaced with a new, complex Yi that is not simply a walking(?)

It's been a feature for all champions for a long time, and remains so for most abilities.\n\nYi has the exact same problem as several AA focused champions, in that they've generally got extremely binary playstyles/strengths. They're either abusive or horrible, and while some of them have a high skill ceiling, the skill level required to be effective is generally very low at below diamond.","replies":[]}]}
