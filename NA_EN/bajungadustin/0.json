It may have been a simple computer trying to sleep that caused the error he got it on his 4th try by disabling sleep mode which kept the connection alive until it was done.. He is getting a lot of random dump file creation errors when joint matches tho.. And frankly so am I.. I know what's unrelated problem.. But that's his only issue now.. And it's intermittent and annoying but playable.. Just looks bad for him as a fresh player to see so many errors.","replies":[]}]}]}
