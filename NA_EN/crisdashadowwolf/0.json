I don't know if its a bug or simply you guys aren't allowing anyone to purchase these skins. its ridiculous I wanna spend my money on a skin that I want but I cant even buy a skin I want because itll only show me like 2 skins :/  . please help","replies":[{"poster":"Zombiemaster","date":"2017-03-14T06:29:56.646+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are many skins that are classified as legacy skins, meaning they were available in the store at one point but are no longer available for purchase. However, legacy skins do have a chance of returning to the store sometime in the future, with some being seasonal skins that are pretty much guaranteed to be available at a certain time of the year, like winter or Halloween skins.\n\nWarring Kingdoms Azir is a seasonal Legacy skin, released for the celebration of Chinese New Year, so unfortunately it isn't likely to return until next year. Feral Warwick is a legacy skin, but it's not a seasonal one, so there's no guarantee of when it will make a return to the store. You're going to have to keep an eye out on the news page for when Riot opens the \"legacy vault.\"\n\nGrey Warwick, on the other hand, is a limited skin, and was only obtainable through the Refer-A-Friend program, similar to Medieval Twitch. Unfortunately the program is now retired, so there is currently no way to obtain the skin.\n\nHope this clears things up.","replies":[{"poster":"CrisDaShadowWolf","date":"2017-03-14T19:44:21.167+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yes thank you. this really helped solved my questions. it is sad that I wont get to purchase warring kingdom azir until next year but at least I know now when itll be back. this information has definitely helped me out.

Any legacy skins that you're interested in could return to the store, but might also be found in hextech crafting or mystery gifts.
