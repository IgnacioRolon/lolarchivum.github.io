I can play other games just fine, the problem only occurs when I enter a LoL game.\nI tried Reinstalling and repairing the game.. but still nothing changed.. can anyone help please..\nThankfully my team have been able to remake the games after I disconnect but in one game we got firstblood and they were not able to... and I finally reconnected after a while and completed the game but the problem still hasn't stopped.. Help me please! \n\nEdit: The problem has been solved, the new windows 10 update including the xbox app was the cause of the problem. The solution is to open the xbox app -> go to settings -> Disable the \"record and take screenshots using Game DVR\" .\n\nThanks to Declined and Porocles for helping solve the issue!","replies":[{"poster":"Declined","date":"2016-08-19T22:28:39.506+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey  hi im doku,\n\nThat sounds incredibly strange, and I have to admit this is the first time I've come across this particular type of bug.\nWhile I have seen similar stuff before this one certainly is odd.\n\nI have a hunch your computer have trouble rendering certain animations, causing it to 'freeze up', this could indicate outdated drivers.\n\nSo that's where I would start.\n\nAnother cause for this could be damaged files, in which case I would suggest running a repair.\n\nI also have a few clarification questions:\n\n* You say your computer freeze, but does that mean you can't use ctrl + alt + esc?\n* No buggsplat\n* No blue screen of death\n* Which operating system are you using?\n* Are you using third party software?\n\nThat should be it for now, looking forward to hearing back from you ˆ-ˆ","replies":[{"poster":" hi im doku","date":"2016-08-19T23:01:13.611+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Declined,\n\nFirst of all thanks for replying, I know that the problem is strange.. I've been looking it up online but didn't have any luck.\n\nI have already tried running a repair this morning but it did not help at all.\n\nMy laptop freezes: can't ctrl + alt + esc  / alt + tab .. or anything else, all i can do is shut my laptop down using the power button.\n\nNo bug splat or blue screen of death\n\nI am using windows 10\n\nAnd I am not using any third party software \n\nFor the past month I was able to play league freely without any trouble.. this only started on the 15th of August, and it's really frustrating.\n\nBy the way after re-installing the game I was able to play 1 game without problems.. but the in the next game it crashed again..\n\nI'll be waiting for your reply, thanks in advance :]","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-19T23:07:35.578+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the assist, Declined!  This issue has been recurring over the last few days, and it may be a result of a recent Windows 10 update.  Specifically, the [Xbox Game Bar ](http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8637-game-bar-turn-off-windows-10-a.html)seems to be causing the game to freeze.  Disable it and try again in a custom game.
