Once it happened to myself, and the other time to a friend.\r\n\r\nThe time it happened to me, Arcade Riven fought with me, and her third Q with the knockup made my screen freeze and a few seconds later, a BSOD appeared. \r\n\r\nA BSOD happened to my friend yesterday while we were playing One for All (vs Riven), and when he texted me it happened, I checked and there was an ennemy player with the Arcade skin. I find it quite unlikely that the two events are unrelated.\r\n\r\nI don&#039;t have the skin so I can&#039;t test and try to replicate it, but I guess it has something to do with the knockup, maybe when someone uses auto-attacks to cancel the animations. The Arcade Riven spells are quite visual, and maybe there is a problem when two of those animations are triggered at the same time.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-05-10T18:42:39.751+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey x9 eBay Janna - \n\nHave you tried doing a client repair to see if there's a jumbled file that may be causing this? Have you noticed this with any other Riven skins/base skin?","replies":[{"poster":"x9 eBay Janna","date":"2016-05-14T22:39:53.638+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, I did this after the crash. \nBut this happened to someone else on another computer with the same Riven skin. \n\nI really think this has something to do with this skin, and either the 3rd Q or an autoattack, maybe when they both occur at the same time. The skin effects were clearly visible on the screen when it froze just before the computer crashed.","replies":[]}]}]}
