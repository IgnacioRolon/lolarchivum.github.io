My last game was a prime example.  People forcing other people to play a game out at 27 mins with no objectives at all and the score is 11-37 and  and they are in our base, Is infact bullshit.  Further more.. for the enemy to sit outside the nexus and just farm kills instead of finish the game is Also complete bullshit.. thats greifing. and should be reportable but its not.

You get banned for breaking rules; no amount of money that you spend on this game will ever be used as leverage for you keeping your account. If you are toxic, you will get banned. You are hardstuck silver because your skill level is silver, not because your teammates are dragging you down.

I believe in the summoner code, it strictly advises against speaking to toxic players. Which he did, judging by his chat logs. The reason for this is because it can be seen as antagonizing the situation. \n\nIt's best to just keep hush, and play your game out. Maybe have a little fun with it. When this happens to me, and I'm in a completely unwinnable situation, I just make jokes and small talk with the team and the enemy team. It helps lighten the atmosphere of an already stressful environment. However, so long as my team is trying, I'm going to try. That's what this game is about. League of Legends is a team sport.","replies":[{"poster":"TSW Stryken","date":"2019-12-04T20:50:56.096+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Why dont do Everyone a favor and Post the WHOLE chat log instead of just what i said?

There are NO stipulations that allow you to break the rules, regardless of what people are saying to you, or what people are doing in the game. The reaction to rule breaking, or bad behavior, is not to break the rules yourself. The reaction they seek, is for you to report them and let Riot handle it. So even if someone was calling you trash, wishing ill will on you or your family, it would make no difference in the decision to punish you or not. The only difference it would make, would be us on the boards seeing the context and perhaps some people (i dont judge you as a person based on riots in game rules or a small snippet of chat in a game) judging you differently. But who cares what random anonymous strangers think of your screen name anyways? I hope you dont.\n\nSo to you, what purpose would showing other people's chat serve? (And btw if players in silver were not even remotely close to your skill level, you would not be hardstuck. Plat and diamond players have NO problems getting out of silver. Dont let your ego hold you back. You will never improve if you just blame others for being stuck)","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"TSW Stryken","date":"2019-12-04T03:20:47.924+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":11,"body":"All it clearly does is make people start a new account... its obvious that banning an account is not the solution..

If you have played as many games as i have and have Opened as many tickets due to players Intentionally ruining games. you would be Upset when you win 11 out 14 games in a row and you get to silver 2 promos to get into silver one.. Then Consistently Lose every game until you are demoted 2 divisions because of leavers you would be upset also..\n\n3. I played with the same troll who played for 2 mins of the game.. then dc'ed for 10 mins, to rejoin ,feed, and leave again.... 2 games in a ROW! Check those reports out blitz bot.. i reported him twice in a row.. and ironicly he was able to troll me twice..\n\ni have over 6000 games played.. and the only thing im upset about is that fact that your ban system promotes players who dont actually play the game as intended.. and its obvious and im sure MANY other people see it as well. I am also upset about losing the skins i have aquired over 9 years and i wont be spending a dollar on a skin ever again. \n\ni mean lets be honest.. Whats more fair?  banning peoples accounts for what i did Or Making players like me who have played a ton games  play against first timers? from what i see so far.. \n\nNot only have people i personally known stop playing the game because of stuff like this.. i find it funny that the permaban you placed on my account ( as im sure Many others)  is Clearly Not the solution and Never will be the solution.. Call of duty is good example. Toxic chat because of leavers and afker's. Dota2 Also realizes this and does not ban your account, they simply put you in a lower que time..

I DO NOT WORK FOR RIOT. I say this because you seem to think I do, even though I don't bare the insignia, nor is my name marked in red. The last thing I want is Riot getting the impression that I am impersonating a Riot employee.\n\nThat said, let's talk about some of these examples. The guy saying \"GG\" and getting banned. That's usually the result of a defect in the reform card, that causes the reform card to not show all text. 1 rioter commented on this issue, saying that special characters were the cause of the incident, and later revealed the actual chat logs. Another thing, and this has been covered numerous times on this particular board, being banned is not mutually exclusive to the last game you played. As reports build up, it will eventually trigger the ban. So the guy getting banned for saying \"GG\" may in fact be very toxic, and the reform card chose a chat log that did not reflect his behavior properly.\n\nNext, let's talk about your account. 4,000 games is, well, a lot of games for 1 season. While I'm not saying it's a bad thing, as I tend to grind out games every now and then, it would seem you may be destroying your own MMR. You said you dropped 2 divisions after losing promos. This is a big no no, and is a sure fire way to ruin your accounts mmr. The larger the losing streak, further your mmr plummets. If your MMR gets to low, you will notice you are playing with players far below your accounts ranking. For example, me! I'm not having the best time this preseason, and since decay is still active, I'm pressured to play in a whole new meta I haven't fleshed out yet. It's very whacky, preseason is. So because of this, I have been doing atrocious. My account has suffered from loss after loss and resulting in a negative win ratio (48%). I did eventually get demoted, but while I was still in diamond, I was consistently getting gold players on my team, while the enemy team was getting plats and diamonds. Weird, huh? It's because I tanked my mmr. \n\nWhen this happens, it's best to take a break, a week off seems to be the sweet spot for me. However, if you keep playing on and on, you're going to most certainly put your account in an extremely difficult situation to get out of. So when you're getting those really rough players, it's best to just take a small break. \n\nKingTyrant mentions that age affects your ban chance. This is simply not the case. You get 4 chances and that's it. If you want an example, I was chat restricted on my main. I was in good standing for 2 years after the fact! Never spoke in all chat. But one day I was having a rough one, and called someone trash. Doesn't sound to bad does it? No slurs or anything, just an argument with the worse of it being \"trash\". My account was permabanned a few minutes after the game. Even though I had a good track record for 2 years running. So I don't believe age actually affects your accounts standing. \n\nYour account holds no monetary value. Riot owns your account, and it is solely a privilege to play on that account. Because of this, you can't stake claim to the amount of money spent in the game. Especially since the game is entirely free to play outside of aesthetics,  cosmetic purposes. So bringing up how much you spent or how old your account is will not rest well with your case. \n\nChat logs are only provided to benefit you as a player. Therefore, you will only see your own chat to reflect on your actions. This is because you are completely in control of what you say in chat. That is why you will never receive a chat log about your teammates. Two wrongs do not make a right. It is written in the summoners code, advising against engaging in any arguement or harrassment, regardless if it's being done to you or another player. The best course of action is to simply mute the player without saying a word to them, and report them after the game. You'd be surprised at how effective this method is. Not only does it immediately put a stop to bickering and time spent typing. It can even lead to a victory. I've seen it many of times. \n\nI hope you learned a lot from this thread, and the consequences of your actions. It truly is a shame to see an account like that dismissed to the void. But the bright side is, you get to have a fresh start, which means your mmr on your account will start at gold when you get to ranked, giving you the opportunity to truly display your magnificent Jhin skills. \n\nGood luck, Summoner!{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[{"poster":"Nightsky Pirate","date":"2019-12-05T05:26:48.416+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"No troll, you deserve a cookie.

I have been chat restricted and banned many times. I am older now so I behave a lot better now and haven't had any kind of punishment for probably the past 2 or 3 years. \n\nTo OP honestly if this got you permabanned then you deserved it the multiple problems you caused up to this point. I don't know how you play the game so long and have no idea that you could get perma banned if you continue to act like a jerk in chat. Anyways if you want to keep playing the game just make a new account and dont be toxic... like ever then you wont have to worry about it. Or do what you have done for the last 9 years and you will eventually get that account perma banned as well .","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2019-12-04T10:55:06.900+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=TSW Stryken,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=aurbGGLb,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2019-12-04T03:20:47.924+0000)\n>\n> it only shows what i said.. it doesnt SHOW ANYONE ELSES messages or words.. .. so explain that one.. \n\nSure.\n\nThink of the behavioral system like a health bar (or tension meter) in music games. When you hit the note at an off beat,  your tension meter  increases. When you completely miss a note, the meter increases by alot. When you hit the note at good timings, it reduces the meter. \n\nRiot's behavior system works the same way, as in we all have a toxicity meter attached to our accounts. When players are mildly toxic, it goes up a tad. When people use hate speech, it pretty much fills up the meter. of course, clean games reduce the meter. \n\nNow understand that the system punishes based on consistency x severity,  meaning you can be punished for 1 game of extreme toxicity or many many games of mild severity.  \n\nThe reason why other's chat isn't shown is because Riot wants you to understand and evaluate your words alone, and not compare it to others. Other people's toxicity won't increase your toxicity meter and their toxicity will add to their toxicity meter. \n\nKeep in mind that it is possible for playerA to get punished and playerB not to, even though playerB was waaayyyyy more toxic . Let's say playerA started the game with the toxicity meter at 95% and playerB's at 35%. Ingame, playerB said some pretty nasty shit and playerA responds with something mild. After the game, playerA gains 10% toxicity and playerB gains 50%. Now playerA is at 105% toxicity and gets punished, whereas playerB is at 85%, and not punished in that specific game, even though playerB was found to be 5x more toxic than playerA in that game.","replies":[{"poster":"RIP my 13900","date":"2019-12-04T13:58:33.005+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not aware of how the system works but if it does, it would explain a lot.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Yin Yang Taoist","date":"2019-12-04T16:30:40.191+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"OP, its on paper.
