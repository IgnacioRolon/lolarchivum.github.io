Please start the jungler with smite and flash as summoner spells.  I know this is kinda like a retard fail move on the junglers part.  But please help me help them by never letting them forget it unless they swap roles then well fuck me.\n\nEdit:  I am not saying force them to play smite flash.  I am saying during the camp select portion auto start them with smite flash because 90% of junglers use it.  If you want to swap flash for ignite or ghost fine.  But that way when they forget to swap spells you at the very least have smite.  I only said flash in addition because it is the second most common spell to use as jungler.  I am not even saying force the guy who picked jungle to use smite because you can lane swap just start there screen with it.
