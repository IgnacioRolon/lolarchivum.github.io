Do you feel terror at somebody with a dynamite belt in the middle of Antarctica by any chance? No, because they can't reach you from there, just like they can't reach you if you muted them.

Most of the people I find on this game is young to always think it cool to \"talk trash/big\" or be annoying. Be the mature one and not ruin the experience for the rest of your team due to one person. \n\n\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}} ","replies":[{"poster":"CerealBoxOfDoom","date":"2016-11-01T06:45:45.829+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"indeed I can ignore people.
