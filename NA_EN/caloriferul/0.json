There is a limited time, free icon you can get for world's. Each championship box you get gives you 3 shards. Use 10 to make it anext exclusive gold icon. FOR THE RECALL AND IN GAME ICON buy a 250 rp icon of your team choice, then upgrade it with 10 championship shards previously mentioned. This gives you the in-game icon, of your teams choice, in gold. To get the recall upgrade it again for 12 shards to make the icon diamond and have your team logo under your feet when you back.
