Guess I&#039;ll add my bit.\n\nI recently got banned for 800+ years, despite never having any previous penalisations.\nThe cause? Toxicity. What else?\nI&#039;m wasn&#039;t exactly rating my chances of surviving those 800 years as very high, so I appealed, obviously.\nI got replied to by about 5 different people, all saying the same shit: You&#039;re toxic, goodbye.\nDespite me only being toxic in two games, I was instantly banned, without even a second chance, and when I pressed the point, the answer I was given was that I was _extremly toxic_. \nHonestly? Zero tolerance policy for toxicity means that you don&#039;t condone toxicity in any form. Not &quot;_slightly toxic_, not _somewhat toxic_, and not _extremely toxic_. Just toxic. And that should mean a perma ban for anyone and everyone that decides to vent their feelings in the chat.\nBut no. Turns out they can twist their words when it suits them.\nI accepted my fate, and I&#039;ve decided to stop playing League overall. I&#039;m not looking for sympathy or anything like that. I&#039;m just posting this thread here as a lesson to everyone. \nDoesn&#039;t matter if you&#039;ve been playing this game since it came out, or if you&#039;re the nicest person around. You could have the cleanest account with no previous reports or anything. But if you say one word, or respond to someone that is giving you shit, remember that the report system doesn&#039;t care about context. If you are reported by someone, and Riot sees that you called them &quot;a %%%got&quot; or whatever, they **WILL** ban you. Doesn&#039;t matter if what the other guy said was worse, or if he started the argument. If you are the one that gets reported, you will be the one that suffers.\n\nSo overall, be careful. This community is full of idiots, and Riot has no idea how to sort it out. Either that or they don&#039;t care.\nDon&#039;t bother trying to appeal your ban, because Riot don&#039;t care about an individual case when they have millions of other accounts that are playing their game. The best you can do is mute them, because no matter how much is said by whatever idiot is hounding you, if you say one word back to him, you will get banned if he reports you, because they won&#039;t look at his side. All they care is that you told him to kill himself.\nNo consideration for it being your first time being toxic will be the foremost thing against you. You will get banned permanently.\n\nSo for now, shut up, mute the retard that is trying to start an argument with you, and hope that Riot changes their bullshit reasoning for toxicity perma bans.\n\nI&#039;m done with this game, but those of you that are still interested in playing, please take my advice.\nCheers.\n\n-A Banned League Player","replies":[{"poster":"Dynikus","date":"2017-02-22T02:24:27.065+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Not \"slightly toxic, not somewhat toxic, and not extremely toxic.

What is much more likely is that the system looks at everyone that has been reported enough to see if their chat includes anything against the rules, then acts accordingly, ignoring whether they started it or not.","replies":[]}]}
