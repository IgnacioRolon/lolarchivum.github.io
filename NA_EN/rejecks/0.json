Riot has ignored this fact for some reason or to my knowledge neglected to do anything about it because they keep on adding true damage to the game. A Vayne has passive true damage that deals a considerable amount as it is, now when she builds guinsoos rageblade, her W ability is doubled.. dealing true damage more consistently and the champion is arguable very strong because of this and it is safe to say that Vayne's kit is very unbalanced with this item. There are complaints about Jax's power 1-2 items in, one of these being guinsoos rageblade. Yet again another champion that takes conqueror and builds into rageblade and snowballs beyond control. \r\nThis situation needs to be addressed please because it is making the game unbalanced and very difficult to enjoy.","replies":[{"poster":"Frosted Tips","date":"2019-03-18T19:41:26.911+0000","up_votes":56,"down_votes":5,"body":"Guinsoo's is not broken.

This doesn't mean the autos themselves get doubled - the on-hits behind them do, so Vayne's W for example. The thing about this is that these effects are locked and often balanced behind three hits for a reason - their effects are often very strong and can easily decide a fight or trade if you can proc them. The consequence of lessening the amount of shots to proc them is, along with just seeing the effect more often, you get shit like this:\n\nSay you needed to proc an effect twice in a fight to really win it. Normally you'd have to take six shots to proc it twice - but with Guinsoo's, you'd proc it three times instead in that amount of time, but you'd also get the effects off twice far sooner, which means that you could end up killing far faster than normal - it's like if attack speed is bonus CDR for your attacks, but you also get rewarded with additional CDR on top of that for maintaining max stacks.  This translates to your opponent getting far less time to \"outplay\" you in (IE burst you down before you just auto them to death) and is the leading cause of sustained-fire champions like Vayne or Yi suddenly just bursting down every single thing in the game in a matter of a second each.\n\nIn short: Fuck this effect.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Saianna","date":"2019-03-18T20:10:57.333+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think that's what OP meant, without naming the real culprit :P","replies":[]},{"poster":"FSRER","date":"2019-03-19T13:06:51.036+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"And here we see 2 downvotes.

The only part of the item that’s an issue and can be considered broken is the phantom hit passive. Most on-hits were balanced around one effect per hit, not being doubled up. It was an issue with Devourer/Sated Devourer as well.\n\nIn the case of Vayne, and even Yi, it amplifies their damage more so than other champs because of the on-hit effects in their kits. Kog’s on-hit effects were also an issue with the passive, I think? Says a lot when Yi and Vayne are picking up the item and they don’t really care about the AP or %pen.\n\nThere’s two possible solutions I see: make champ kits more on-attack as opposed to on-hit, leaving The passive aboe to affect item on-hit effects, or remove Phantom Hit and retune that power back into other hybrid DPS power on the item.\n\nEdit: I vote the second option.","replies":[{"poster":"AirKingNeo","date":"2019-03-19T02:24:42.916+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"Except Sated Devourer wasn't an issue.

Now league only has 1 multiplicative onhit item, so we don't see any issues.\n\nHow was Guinsoo a multiplicative on hit effect? The Attack speed ramp? That’s a different situation and nowhere near the same effect. Champs that bought Sated Devourer didn’t even always buy Guinsoo’s. Vayne definitely didn’t. Yi didn’t. Don’t think Shyvana did. Kog only built Guinsoo’s.\n\nIt’s old passive was the tiamat style attack, which didn’t apply on hits outside the original target. Prior to Guinsoo’s Rage acquiring the Phantom Hit, it was just a straight hybrid DPS item. AD, AP, AS, and then a wave a la old Kayle E or Tiamat.\n\nPerhaps you don’t see any issues with Phantom Hit, but you appear to be the only one, at least that I’ve seen in these discussions. The general consensus is that Phantom Hit is a busted mechanic. Why? Because of it’s existence, on-hits will have to be balanced around it. This will cause them to either be normal with Phantom Hit and useless without it, or normal without it and absolute insanity with it. No, there’s nothing healthy about Phantom Hit.

Phantom Hit on old Sated and current Rageblade gives a second proc of that.

However he relies on Rageblade for the stats as well as the Phantom Hit now. \n\n> Yi has never been a problem with it. He's never been meta.\n\nThat’s a poor counter point. Something can be a problem and not be meta. Yo was never meta because high elo shuts him down too easily since they know how to coordinate, watch vision, and CC properly, as well as counter jungling, which was a factor in beating Sated junglers. However, his power did increase drastically and has stayed there because Phantom Hit stuck around, allowing his passive to stack, what, what every 2-3 hits instead of 4? \n\n> Shyvana and Xin Zhao weren't problems with Sated Devourer because they weren't meta, except Shyvana because she had high clear speed (which isn't Sated Devourer).\n\nAgain the meta comment. Not meta, so not a problem. Brilliant. Forgetting that Xin Zhao, Shyvana, Yi, and the other Sated Junglers just powerfarmed and then started steamrolling once the enchant got the phantom hit status. Xin Zhao also had his heal hit because of Phantom Hit, when previously it wasn’t an issue.\n\nOh, almost forgot about Udyr. He loved Phantom Hit as well, at least on Sated Devourer.\n\n> That's a misrepresentation of how BoRK works. BoRK's onhit damage lessens every hit.\n\nYou are correct. It was late and I misread the passive. I did correct the post.\n\n> You realize every third hit for Phantom Hit is a huge nerf since it's reduces it from a 50% onhit damage increase to a 33% onhit damage increase, which is a massive loss of 17% damage for onhit effects.\n\nIt’s still a problem though. You can shift it all you want, but given the nature of champ kits and Phantom Hit, it can’t be balanced properly. On-hit champions have a thing of falling in and out of meta and power very easily, often based on the status of their items. So long as Phantom Hit exists, every on-hit needs to be tuned with it in mind, which then weakens the items for non-Rageblade users.\n\nThat’s merely the item balance issue. There is also the main point that people keep bringing up: on-hit’s in champion kits. The strongest champs among those that use Rageblade are those who’s own abilities have on-hits, balanced around one stack/proc per auto. \n\n> They aren't complete buffs across the board (gold cost is a lot) and the numbers can always be tuned.\n\nI did say beyond Phantom Hit and gold cost they were buffs. That gold cost is..iffy. I believe that’s..a kills worth or another 15 CS? Is that the right numbers.\n\n> Attack speed shouldn't be capped because no other stat in the game is, except CDR because abilities have CC attached.\n\nThis is..an odd point. I do see where you’re coming from though. However, all the other stats have soft caps and diminishing returns..except AD and AP I believe. It is true no other stat beyond CDR is hard capped, but CDR and AS both act similarly. CDR means you can get your spells out more often, increasing spell damage over time, while AS does the same for autoattacks.\n\nHowever, unlike CDR, not many champs can hit that cap. An ulting Yi and a max stack Kayle are the two biggest culprits, and Lethal Tempo  helps Kayle break it. The cap is just in a place that most attack speed champs can’t hit it.","replies":[{"poster":"AirKingNeo","date":"2019-03-20T02:44:04.508+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> This is true.

It was an issue with the first because it became more burst per second, it was seen as an issue with the next iteration. It’s still a bit bursty, but at least it’s more reasonable now.\n\nKeystone items are tricky.\n\n> No. You wouldn't be a problem if you're never meta because that means you're easily beatable.\n> \n> In low elo...\n\nHere is the crux. I disagree greatly with that. Why? Because being a problem, being a broken aspect, goes beyond being meta or not. Yi, Shyvana, Sated were indeed huge problems for lower elos. Garen is also a problem. Yorick was a problem before his ult changes. Illaoi is a bit of a problem right now.\n\nWhy? Because for all of these, they are incredibly strong in low elo, but weak to useless in higher elo. This here is a problem. Understand, I am an advocate for balancing around the best players. When something is designed in a way that it’s strength is eventually only in crushing low ranks, that’s a problem.\n\nThis adds a level of problem-ness to Phantom Hit. It’s incredibly strong the lower it goes, while higher elo it’s mainly Vayne that gets use out of it. It forces on-hits to be balanced around itself or be too strong. It has created more issues than it has solved.\n\n> That's not an argument. You ignored the concept that it is infact a nerf.\n\nIt’s a shift. You did propose a nerf, yes, but it came with buffs. That’s why I said it was a shift. You took some power out of Phantom Hit and put it elsewhere, but Phantom Hit still remained and would continue it’s trend. It’s not a good mechanic.\n\n> Kayle doesn't take LT anymore due to her change in her E ability.\n\nYou mean..the keystone that she can still make use of because she needs Attack Speed and runs almost 1/4 of the time she’s played in Plat+, 18% of the time in Diamond+?

Rageblade is why we are not in a top jungle tank only meta.  If it was truly broken every champ that can even slightly abuse it would be running it every game and we wouldn't see anyone that couldn't in those roles.\n\nStop moaning about everything for crying out loud","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sucction","date":"2019-03-19T04:36:53.321+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"I don't think it's an issue on Jax, just because he doesn't really have the space or budget for it. He tends to want other items more, sooner, and so doesn't ever end up grabbing rageblade.\n\nI do agree that it's a big issue on Yi and Vayne, though. Yi thankfully isn't overpowered with it, but he's definitely very unhealthy and breaks a lot of rules in the game, like him being able to fight literally any non-Jax bruiser no matter how fed they are after he hits 2 items. \n\nVayne does that too, though, and she's definitely the biggest offender. Even without rageblade she'd still be the most undeniably broken ADC, but with it she's fucking bonkers. It needs to be addressed, maybe nerfed or potentially even melee only with something being worked out for Kog'Maw, who would be gutted otherwise. While we're at it I'm certain Vayne's Q cd buff could be reverted without issue. She was balanced before it came in, not sure why she was buffed in the first place.\n\nNow that I think about it, didn't she just get a really expensive skin?\n\n\n...Oh.","replies":[]},{"poster":"HAHAHAHAHAHAaaHa","date":"2019-03-19T00:44:17.026+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"it's a STUPID item who should get removed","replies":[]}]}
