Including Sona's Etwahl.  They were appropriately placed on Sona's original in-game model's dress design.  They are also visually apparent in her current splash art.\n\nThis is a Bass Clef:\n\nhttp://clipart-finder.com/data/preview/bass_clef_144115.jpg\n\nAs you can guess, it's used by Bass instruments and other lower octave tools.  **It does not belong on Sona's model** and is extremely offensive and disgusting to her character.\n\nSeriously Riot, get your act together.  Her original in-game model designer clearly knew what they were doing.  How could you not take a few moments to research what you're doing so as to not make these horrendous mistakes?\n\nCurrent model with Bass Clefs:\n\nhttp://i.gyazo.com/975469378c8d54e68a8995becf59b24d.png\n\nOld model and splash arts with Treble Clefs:\n\nhttp://i.gyazo.com/1509438c15e667a97eeb2b9795adc538.png\nhttp://img3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20110222183950/leagueoflegends/images/b/b6/Sona_OriginalSkin_Ch.jpg\nhttp://i.gyazo.com/10553621e34156ae8252c3fc3eaee266.png","replies":[{"poster":"It Is I Emoto","date":"2014-12-17T16:08:32.893+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"I prefered her older robes much more because of the treble clef. Sona is playing quite a high pitched instrument, wich makes the bass clef quite weird on her dress. Even if they're usually located at the lower half of a bar, they're also on her robe, and even funnier that they're doing a heart shape, made me surprised.\nhttp://i.gyazo.com/7ac3f6dacef084f0897fc175ff43aa4c.png\n\n. It's cute, but it doesn't fit Sona at all.

The two halves are so disjoined that it looks rather awkward.\n\nI wonder if anyone on the skins team actually plays an instrument.  They should've been able to notice the inconsistencies.  It feels like some random kid googled \"music symbol\" and used the first thing he saw without realizing her dress design was already musically themed.","replies":[{"poster":"It Is I Emoto","date":"2014-12-17T22:19:49.384+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"You know whats even funnier?

Agreed they look better on the old model, but like I said they're disjoined now and that's what looks so off-putting.  They're actually conjoined on her original dress.\n\nThis all aside, they have no place replacing the Treble Clefs on the front of her dress.

Some were true works of art, as far as game graphics go.  I was truly awe-struck the first time I played Silent Night after picking her up in last year's x-mas sales.  The vibrant colors were absolutely stunning and it remained my favorite skin up until they nerfed.  Now the colors are gone.  I can no longer see the colors.

Green hair aside, her upper robes aren't supposed to be red, they're more of a reddish-violet.  Moving down, her bottom robe isn't supposed to be whatever horrible blue they're trying to pass off.  It should be a blackish-violet.  I think that's why the old Silent Night looked better, she had those magnificent contrasts between the varied shades of violet and the bright golds sitting opposite the color spectrum.  I don't think they used any kind of violet a single time on her new model, it looks like they just used a 6-color box of crayons, with the purple crayon missing.","replies":[{"poster":"It Is I Emoto","date":"2014-12-19T23:58:03.229+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Though, the ethwal on that skin is even less detailed on the original skin LOL\nI think fearless team was really just a bunch of unexperienced designers and this is really disappointing :/","replies":[{"poster":"Pika310","date":"2014-12-21T04:35:13.225+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"People with less experience get payed less.

They quite literally started with a blue base, then plastered yellow over the bottom half.  No effort whatsoever trying to transition or even at least separate the two colors.  As we learned back in 1st grade, what happens when you throw yellow on top of blue?  Voila, you get green.  Surprise surprise.  It looks disgusting.\n\nThey were sort of able to get away with this lack of effort on the Arcade skin, solely because blue is already a component of purple.  Even so, that's still no excuse as it still came out looking bad as well.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Pika310","date":"2014-12-22T01:46:54.462+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"**#BetterNerfSona**","replies":[]},{"poster":"FantasySniper","date":"2014-12-20T00:04:06.169+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Good eye, never noticed that they were bass clefs, but I guess that was just because the dots are positioned low.

Sona had gold eyes in her original portrait, but in her current they were changed to blue.  Mayhaps this was done to match Miku's eyes, who can say?
