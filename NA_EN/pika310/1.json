Sona can only apply a speed boost once every 12 seconds at 0% CDR, ~7 seconds at 40% CDR.\n\nThresh may only be able to shield 1 ally at a time, but his shield lasts 4 seconds. Sona's? 1.5 seconds.\nThresh's shield values: level 1: **60** base + **40%** AP\nSona's shield values: level 1: **35** base + **20%** AP\nI forget, how many people do you lane with on bot lane again?\nMhmm...\n\nSona has 1 Hard CC ability, and it's her ult. She doesn't have access to it until level 6. It lasts 1.5 seconds.\nMost Lulu's access her hard CC at level 3. 1 point in Whimsy is 1.25 second polymorph, cooldown with 0% CDR is 18 seconds. That's effective CC every wave.\nLets not forget her Glitterlance, that slow is crazy strong, and doesnt require 3 spell casts to access. Granted, Sona's cant miss (excluding dodge's/blinds) and Lulu's is a skillshot... but with her E on the target, it's REALLY hard to miss (if not impossible).\n\nSoraka's heal is arguably better than Sona's, and is on a much lower cooldown by default.\nSilence is golden. Laning phase, a well placed Soraka E can really throw a wrench in the gears of the opponent. Let's not forget, it can potentially deal damage twice. With 1 point in it, it can potentially deal 140 damage with 0 AP... thats **10** damage less than Sona's ** *ULT* ** with 0 AP. Sona's ult has a 50% AP ratio, where Soraka's E has a 40% AP ratio.\n\nJanna's E gives a **flat, scaling AD bonus** as long as the shield persists.\nSona's Q gives a single on-hit magic damage bonus.\nSingle point values with 0 AP:\nJanna E: 14 flat AD for 5 seconds (max, as long as the shield persists)\nSona Q: 20 bonus on-hit magic damage for one hit.\nJanna clearly provides more sieging power here, not to mention it's a shield... that's damage mitigation.\nShield strength with 1 point and 0 AP comparisons:\nSona W: 35 base\nJanna E: 80 base\nPeronally when I play Janna, I max E first.\nLets assume Sona max's W first for the sake of argument.\nAt level 9, these values are:\nSona W: **115** base + 20% AP\nJanna E: **240** base + 70% AP\nSeriously? Tell me again that Sona's Q AND W are both superior to this SINGLE ability of Janna's.\n\nKarma has 2 damaging spells, hard CC, and an ult with a 45 second cooldown available at level 1. She can easily outshove a Sona during laning phase.\nSingle point shield value comparisons:\nKarma E: **80** base + 50% AP\nSona W: **35** base + 20% AP\nSingle point movement speed boost comparisons:\nKarma E: 40%, lasts 1.5 seconds\nSona E: 10%, lasts 1.5 seconds\n---\nIn every single example, Sona is very clearly outclassed.","replies":[{"poster":"SensualMuffins","date":"2015-01-08T22:03:24.591+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"Sona's also refreshes for every second the ally remains in her aura, diminishing only when the aura stops persisting. If you want to bring 40% CDR into account, Sona's E is up every 8 seconds, that's potentially 3 seconds (or more) of speed boost to multiple allies, leaving a 5 second window where they aren't given more mobility.\n\nYou aren't always in lane with just 1 person, sometimes the jungle comes down as well, meaning Sona's overall shielding becomes greater than Thresh's single target shield, even if his laner clicks his lantern and he gets the shield as well. What are ganks?\nMmhmm.\n\nWhile sona's hard CC is only accessible at 6 and has a longer cooldown than polymorph, it also provides a small amount of damage, whereas polymorph does not, both are equal in trading value, especially considering that most Sona's will follow it with a Q. And while it may be near impossible to miss a glitterlance on an E'd target, you have just lost your shield, and have two abilities on cooldown to provide a near-guaranteed hit. Sona only needs to charge hers and hold it.\n\nSoraka doesn't heal herself with her own heal, and can't heal anything if she is low. Sona's only constraint is mana. Soraka's E does damage twice, but that's only if you somehow manage to get the target to stop inside of it. With 350 MS, I'm able to casually stroll out of the AoE before it cracks twice.\n\nYou state that Janna's E also gives a scaling AD bonus, while you forget to mention Sona's on-hit damage also scales. Her Q also scales up. Meaning Sona alone negates a Janna shield at level 1 with her Q and an Auto.\n\nKarma's hard CC takes time to land, and while she can outshove sona during the laning phase, rarely does she outperform her later. Sona's ability to stun multiple targets, heal herself and a low health target while shielding her team, and giving her entire team MS makes her much better at teamfighting.\n\nKarma has to choose between: Dealing damage and slowing the entire enemy team, Shielding / Speed boosting her whole team, or Healing herself while potentially rooting a single target during a teamfight.  \n\nSona's strength has NEVER been during laning phase, she has ALWAYS been a more teamfight oriented champion, even before her rework, the stats were nice in lane, but were greater when applied to her entire team. So while other supports may outshine her in lane, she does things during the teamfighting portion of the game that make her shine.","replies":[{"poster":"ecneregilleb","date":"2015-01-09T01:30:32.108+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"While you are correct that the duration of her aura increases for each ally she tags, you are still wrong. It does NOT refresh the duration or reapplication of the on-hit bonus/shield/movement speed boost for her allies. It only increases the duration that the aura persists, allowing her to tag other allies.\n\nThough situational, I will stand by my argument that Thresh's shield still outclasses Sona's in the sense that it lasts longer, and provides far more damage mitigation straight out of the gate at the start of the game. That was the only point I was trying to get across. Ganks are what makes the power-level of the shield side-by-side comparisons situational.\n\nThe damage on Sona's ult is laughable, but she's a dedicated support not a hardcore mage. Arguing that the damage should be considered is almost redundant if you ask me, but I do see where you are coming from. Im only assuming that by \"charge and hold it\" you mean cast 3 spells, and hold the passive for the right moment to use her slow, which is where the Glitterlance point was brought up in the first place. Under that logic, the Sona needs to make an immediate decision while \"holding\" her passive to use it for a slow, damage mitigation (W) or extra damage (Q) in the heat of battle. This is all semantics, and we can go back and forth about this for days. Again, the comparison I brought up was to prove that Lulu clearly has more CC power than Sona, being able to use it much more frequently. My point still stands.\n\nAgain, you are correct about Soraka not being able to heal herself with her own heal-ability. The damage on Soraka's Q is not exactly impressive by itself, but it DOES heal her. There have been some Soraka posts on this thread that defend her in that aspect, so I will not even start on her. Again it breaks down to semantics. My point stands that the heal on both characters ends is intended not for themselves being in the support role, but for the team's benefit. Saying that she can't use it on herself is irrelevant, and the numbers still point out that Soraka's heal is overall better for the team. As far as the E damage goes, its all situational. You are right, the second half of the E is easy to walk out of. While you are walking out of it though, my ADC is pegging you with AA's because you are too busy avoiding E's **silence** and second half of the damage. Dont forget about that silence, friend. It's still indeed -- golden.\n\nIn terms of \"laning,\" your statement that a Janna E can be negated by 1 Sona Q... Speaking solely of the damage threshold of the shield itself vs. the damage of Sona LANDING the Q bolt *and* AAing with the on-hit bonus damage, then yes. When I brought up the fact that Janna's E scaled, I wasnt implying that Sona's didnt. It was in response to how you just brushed off her damage bonus all together in your previous post. Are you implying that Sona *still* has more sieging power than Janna? That was my point, which you completely ignored btw.\n\nI can not deny your points about Karma. You are definitely correct all around. Karma is all about immediate battle decisions. She has access to a lot more strength than Sona a lot earlier. Their power-spikes are way different. Thats all I was trying to point out there. As far as the numbers go though, side-by-side comparisons of their shield strengths is still not something to scoff at.\n\n**All** arguments aside, I think I personally learned something here.\nWe have established that Sona's strength does not necessarily lie within laning phase, correct? It lies in teamfights. Why then is that the case when she is one of the squishiest champions in the game? If Sona's strength and power-spike arrives during teamfights, why is she so easy to kill? In a teamfight, targeting her first basically means you negate her as a champion all together because she is an extremely easy to catch. Her whole design under that philosophy is counter-intuitive.\nDo you agree?","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"FantasySniper","date":"2015-01-07T23:35:46.211+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"I can dodge almost all of those.\n\nSo if they use a dash, or just plain walk out of the way, to make my spell worthless, what then?\n\nYou can't juke Sona's stuff, and if she misses, it wasn't because you outplayed her, it was because she missed.
