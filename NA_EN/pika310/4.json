Meanwhile, Riot refuses to address the issue, blatantly displaying their discrimination against Sona players.  Her win-rate in professional play has stayed an unshakable 0% since.  The top Sona players worldwide have been getting repeatedly demoted and most quit the game entirely.  Let&#039;s take a look at where she&#039;s at right now:\n\n4.13:\n\n* 21 Documented Nerfs\n* 2 Confirmed Shadow Nerfs and at least 1 Suspected\n\nAfter 4.13:\n\n* 5 Additionally Documented Nerfs and at least 1 Confirmed Shadow Nerf\n\nStats:\n\n* 5th Lowest base HP\n* 10th Lowest max HP (excluding Sion)\n* 3rd Lowest Base Mana amongst mage-supports, after Lulu and Zyra\n* Lowest Base AD amongst supports, tied with Soraka (excluding Thresh/Lulu)\n* 2nd Lowest max armor amongst supports, after Zyra (excluding Thresh)\n* Lowest MS tier, shared with 3 other mage-supports (9+ sit in higher tiers)\n\nAbilities:\n\n* 1st, 2nd and 3rd shortest ranged spells amongst supports (4th is 43% higher, 5th+ are even more)\n* 2nd Lowest Damage potential amongst supports, after Braum\n* Lowest Base Damage on a spell, tied with Leona&#039;s Q and Taric&#039;s W & E\n* Weakest and most expensive heal in the game, even lower than Relic Shield\n* Weakest and shortest-duration shield amongst all supports\n* Weakest MS spell, roughly tied with Nami\n* Least CC amongst supports\n* Only support in the game w/o hard CC pre-6\n* Sub-par ult outclassed and out-ranged by most supports\n\nSona&#039;s kit is designed to be a close-range tank support, which she is not.  Even if that were the case, the numbers on the abilities are still too weak to be usable, Taric&#039;s kit is stronger and has higher range.  On Sona, this kit is just blatantly counter-intuitive and yet her stats still remain rock-bottom despite this.  Even the abilities themselves are counter-intuitive to each other, the varied cooldowns make Power Chord extremely difficult to use Diminuendo/Tempo, meanwhile Staccato gets repeatedly nerfed in return for the other two being less accessible.\n\n***\n\nOn a final note, her in-game models are still blatant downgrades and wreak of an air of unprofessionalism and complete disregard for accuracy of detail.  They&#039;re amateur-made rush jobs with improper coloring that completely lacks contrast, shading or texture and display incorrect detailing contradictory to her splash-arts.

But when her ap scaling got nerfed and lichbane ap scaling also got nerfed she was hit hard, it'd be like people playing caitlyn or jinx and not building infinity edge and saying she is weak. \nYou can't look at a characters strength without looking at what items they are molded upon. I think the change to lichbane I made would give her a little nudge in the right direction. That's not to say her kit itself will be entirely remedied, you wouldnt exactly want to be completely tied down to an item. At the same, what do you expect you're playing sona and your not building lich bane? Jinx with no IE should expect no less. A little bit of both points at play here.

As well, let's not forget that she can sustain also through her Q, meaning if Soraka is played by an experienced player, you won't struggle with mana and health costs.\n\nSona in return, yes, she has an inbuild Soraka pre-work passive, and an aoe shield, but considering that sometimes you don't want to use the shield, but only the heal makes it extremly frustrating to use. For what you need an shield if you just want to restore health? That's basically wasting mana for no reason. I know, the missing per % increase on Sonas heal was a compensation for that, but after it got nerfed to oblivion, she feels much weaker compared to most other healers.

But you know what else is never going to happen (unless the Sona player is bumbling idiot?) Using her heal when her ally is at 100% health like this troll of an OP suggested. .375 assumes her ally already has 100% full health and takes into account 0% of her self heal. Not even the minimum.\n\nI love logic. I also love trolling trolls.

Seriously, everyone has been complaining about her heal all the time yet for some annoying reason they don't do anything with it and i am sick of hearing people call Sona a heal support. USING YOUR HEAL SHOULD BE A LAST RESORT THING! her heal is pathetic and costs way too much mana for the amount it heals and the shield is only useful to prevent initial damage but TOO BAD IT'S ALSO TIED TO A HEAL!.\n\nI really have no idea who thought that having both a shield and a heal in the same skill was a good idea when they both contradict each other in how you want to use them. You want to shield someone to prevent damage while you want to heal someone to restore the damage that was taken so that literally means that for you to make the most out of the skill it means that you have to wait for whoever you want to shield to actually have taken damage first so your heal aspect doesn't go to waste.
