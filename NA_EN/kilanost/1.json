I mean I'd disable it just to save them the headache that's going to come from all the people losing \nLP and being pissed.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Law of John","date":"2017-03-13T14:09:06.273+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"Naw I say leave it up.  Let the kids play ranked and lose lp.  If they think they are too good for this to affect them, than they deserve a loss of lp.","replies":[{"poster":"FlyingRoboticCow","date":"2017-03-13T14:30:27.398+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"People get into ranked games because the little yellow exclamation mark say's \"We're aware of a problem causing players to disconnect from their games, and are investigating the problem.\"  not hey a shit ton of people can't connect to the game and if you're one of them you're going to take an automatic loss and a leave and all the glory that come with it. Based on my own experience (only two games) and the state of the boards its a large issue and perhaps Riot should do something about it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-03-14T01:45:22.524+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for bringing this to our attention! As soon as we realized there was an issue with our servers causing players to be unable to stay connected in their games, we disabled Ranked Play until the problem was addressed.
