As long as they're roughly the same color (you or some other Riot have already mentioned that you *can* change the hue, but not the color itself because the skin would require the color to be red) and size, Syndra's particles are easily read as \"danger: Syndra's going to hit you with that.\" If Atlantean and Justicar Syndra could make it past your \"clarity control\" requirements, I don't see how this small enhancement (diamond-shaped \"orb\" particles) is so difficult for Riot to adopt and add. It's definitely a \"quality-of-life\" particle for the skin, but I guess Riot's skin standards for pricing/tiers were made flexible so that cases like this could be ignored or denied at will.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-05-03T17:44:05.659+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":4,"body":"Changing the hue rather than the color was in reference to Ahri's orb for 975 RP+ skins.

They're easily discerned as her main armament, being usable with all of her skills to harm or hamper her opponents.\n\nEdit: Wouldn't using weapons as the main precedent for 750 RP quality-of-life particles make for a bad precedent/guideline? That restricts which champions can receive a decent 750 RP skinâ€” champions that don't throw physical weapons around as part of their abilities could get stuck with sub-par 750 RP skins (like Queen of Hearts Syndra appears destined to be released as) due to their having extremely unfitting base ability particles. I'm not saying that every 750 RP skin needs new particles (I think that Marauder Warwick and Ace of Spades Ezreal look fine as they are, personally), but claiming that quality-of-life particle changes must involve a champion's physical weapons could indeed cripple 750 RP skins as a whole. Plus, Warden Nautilus' particle changes don't involve his weapon (an anchor), they're a floating set of shields that only appear when he's using his W (which definitely appears to have magical origins in addition to not involving his anchor). Syndra's orbs are far closer to being her \"weapons\" (being always present on the battlefield and/or around her model) than Nautilus' W particles.","replies":[{"poster":"Jeddy017","date":"2015-05-03T17:57:21.061+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"But if her weapons are purple at every moment,then there is no need to changes.\nThey changed Sivir's Q because to would look weird to be holding one weapon,then it change to the weapon of her base skin once she threw it.","replies":[{"poster":"Zarxis","date":"2015-05-03T18:03:02.446+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Jeddy017,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=IYkmPzEn,comment-id=00020000000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2015-05-03T17:57:21.061+0000)\n>\n> But if her weapons are purple at every moment,then there is no need to changes.\n> They changed Sivir's Q because to would look weird to be holding one weapon,then it change to the weapon of her base skin once she threw it.\n\nThat's why I mentioned changing the basic shape (but not the color or size) of Queen of Diamonds Syndra's orbs. It \"looks weird\" for a skin that's based around red diamonds to be throwing around purple orbs. We can't give her red particles because that would cause a clarity issue for mirror matches (opposing Syndras in mirror matches see their opposite's orbs as red-colored), but making the orbs into diamonds (albeit somewhat \"fat\" diamonds in order to ensure that they remain roughly the same size as her original orbs) could be classified as a quality-of-life change without sacrificing clarity.\n\nAnother possibility would be simply having small red diamond particles floating inside of the original purple orbs. An enemy Syndra would still have red orbs; an allied Syndra would still have purple orbs (but her orbs would simply have a thematically-fitting, unobtrusive, quality-of-life particle).","replies":[{"poster":"Jeddy017","date":"2015-05-03T21:35:05.880+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Dude,it's a 750 tier & 750 tier skins are simple costume changes.Doing all that is outside the scope they had planned.\nIt's clear Riot isn't planning on changing this.If they do,it would be a middle finger to the Annie & Ashe players who asked for similar changes,but got nothing.Why should Syndra players get this when Annie & Ashe players got nothing?","replies":[{"poster":"Zarxis","date":"2015-05-03T22:42:33.011+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Jeddy017,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=IYkmPzEn,comment-id=0002000000000000000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2015-05-03T21:35:05.880+0000)\n>\n> Dude,it's a 750 tier & 750 tier skins are simple costume changes.Doing all that is outside the scope they had planned.\n> It's clear Riot isn't planning on changing this.If they do,it would be a middle finger to the Annie & Ashe players who asked for similar changes,but got nothing.Why should Syndra players get this when Annie & Ashe players got nothing?\n>Should have,could have,would have,the fact is they weren't.The fact is Riot choose their limits & choose to make these skins within those limits.\nCheaper things will have less.\n\n750 tier skins are eligible for quality-of-life particles.
