I don't think my proposals are too crazy of a suggestion.\n\nATTN: Before you read this, just know I and others are asking for another shot. We&#039;re not bad people, we just rage and use foul language at times. \n\nI and countless others have been toxic, yes, we do not deny this. And then we have gone on and been toxic on new accounts that we have made. Partially because we tend to rage and partially because we had our main accounts banned and harbor resentment towards Riot. My proposition is a fair one, and one that could make Riot a few easy extra bucks here and there. Basically, my proposal is; after having your account permanently banned the first and only time, Riot gives you one last final option to reform. You pay a fine of 50 USD. Now I know you might say, that&#039;s too easy, it won&#039;t help the community. But instead of saying hey, let&#039;s reset all penalties and give a fresh start, by paying 50 dollars you agree to never be toxic again. You get a 10-game counter. If get reported 10 times, and the reports are warranted and you are found guilty, your account is gone forever. The system deletes it, the name is up for grabs, and all your stats, awards, purchases, and everything vanish. \n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI have another proposal, a slightly more reasonable one. Instead of jumping from a two-week ban to a permanent ban, which is pretty extreme, Riot adds a 1-month ban, then a 6-month, and then a permanent ban. I just feel, logically, the punishments are disproportionate and illogical. You go from a chat restriction of 10 games, to a 14 day ban, to forever. The escalation is insane and doesn&#039;t help to &quot;reform&quot; anyone. Instead, honestly the best punishment would simply be permanent chat restriction, considering most of us toxic players rage at others for playing poorly, we ourselves play pretty well and don&#039;t intentionally cause losses, we just use sometimes hurtful words. Blocking messages from sending if they contain offensive words would easily reform us toxic players, because we&#039;d be unable to say anything unless it contained normal language. \n\nMost of you won&#039;t read this, and most of you will just write me off as a toxic player who can&#039;t follow the rules. But hey, I&#039;m human, this game gets me angry because this is one of the most time-consuming games, where you can spend 60 minutes toiling for a win and then some asshole decides to do something stupid and you&#039;re just supposed to suppress the anger and go gg? My proposals are just ideas, ideas I put some thought into, ideas that help keep the entire community happy, generate more revenue, and so on.\n\nI spent over 1000 USD on my main account, which was permabanned. I haven&#039;t spent a penny since then, and have even been reported and banned for games where I&#039;ve been ganged up on and reacted to 4-man teams harassing me. One ban flags you for Riot and you get no mercy. I&#039;m just asking for more options and a way to still be able to play on my account that I spent so much time and money on.","replies":[{"poster":"Icy Hot Shoto","date":"2016-11-02T00:23:50.681+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you can't reform after the warnings, you don't deserve to come back.\n\nPlus, Riot already tried something similar. Perma-banned users could contact Riot about joining a thing where if they could get to level 20 without being reported once, their original account would get unbanned. 80 or 90% of those people failed and got reported before level 20.\n\nBe happy Riot allows you to make a new account after being perma banned.","replies":[{"poster":"CiRvcGznqK","date":"2016-11-02T00:39:36.355+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"I actually like that.

We no longer want them playing League of Legends because they hurt the experience of others.\n\nThe result of the experiment was actually 95% of the players being permabanned again. Not 80-90% getting reported before level 20.\n\nThe current punishment levels are as they are because if a player does not change their behavior after multiple warnings, they are not likely to change. We used to have other punishment levels in place, but all it did was delay the amount of time until a player arrived at perma-ban status. It did not help with reform rates, and ultimately allowed more games to be ruined.\n\nThere are diminishing reform rates at each level of penalty. The majority of players who get a chat restriction, never get any other penalty. Additionally, the vast majority of players never get any sort of penalty at all. Players that get penalties of any sort are by far the outlier.","replies":[{"poster":"CiRvcGznqK","date":"2016-11-02T02:10:00.360+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":6,"body":"[EDIT: Honestly, just adding an option to turnoff in-game chat would significantly reduce the urge to rage. The option would be in the client so you couldn't flick it back on in-game. Boom. Another deterrent. You can't be toxic if you can't talk. But keep telling me banning accounts is better than permanently chat block, it makes so much sense.\n\nI may eventually spend money on this game again, but until that time I'm just a freeloader clogging up your servers and shitting on your noobs. Yeah, I get I can be an asshole, but being nice doesn't get you as far. My poor attitude aside, I make valid points, and you stick to your script, but permanent account bans do nothing to prevent or reform toxicity, we're still here.]\n\nTo be fair, I don't even get warnings anymore. I don't know if that has something to do with my Mac client because it's glitchy as hell on macOS/OS X compared to Windows. Again, your statistics are skewed because I highly doubt that you're accounting for players who create a summoner and play a few games and then never play again. Inactive accounts, or accounts sitting at level 30 that take around 2 years to expire, and then people who play consistently. I feel that the average person who gets permabanned plays a significant amount of League each week or month, so you'd have to compare the percentage of those banned to those who play similar amounts of League, day, week, and month. So I'm sure your permabanned community is actually a higher percentage than you make it out to be. \n\nTell me how permanently banning me or someone else for being verbally toxic, is more efficient than simply removing our ability to communicate in-game. If you were truthful and aware you'd realize a fraction of the League population actually constructively communicates during the game. So banning that tiny percentage you wave at me from speaking in-game would eradicate your toxicity problem without upsetting anyone. Those with soft skin wouldn't have to deal with us scrutinizing them, and we wouldn't be able to say anything. \n\nBut instead ... I'm forced to make new accounts and I'm far better than entry level players. So they get demolished in early levels and that hinders their learning process and overall enjoyment, also, like I said barely anyone actually communicates, so even when I try to help them, they don't give a shit and don't try to get better. This isn't Halo where someone shitty can pick up a rocket launcher and kill people, you need a bit more intelligence/skill/time to get good at this game.","replies":[{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2016-11-02T03:42:13.415+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm all for this.

It's about the time spent, the champions bought with IP, and the dreadful pain of leveling up from 0-30 where you have to deal with toxic, unskilled, overall inexperienced players. Which is a punishment in and of itself. In professional sports, nobody is getting banned for cursing. \n\nPlus, from a psychological standpoint, your behavior will not realistically change in 14 days. It can, but if toxicity is verbal, instituting permanent chat restriction or simply not allowing certain words to be \"entered\" would more effectively prevent and deter toxicity because you would have to find more appropriate language to use. If the aim is to reform. Is that not the goal? Reform not remove.","replies":[{"poster":"AeroWaffle","date":"2016-11-01T21:52:15.667+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"You are asking for preferential treatment though.\n\nThose who can spend $50 get the extra chance at the end.

The percentage of verbally toxic players and those whose gameplay is toxic is probably similar or greater in regards to the latter. You're saying you'd rather play with someone who feeds 10 kills, doesn't say a word, even when you try to communicate civilly with them, then play with someone who knows the mechanics and their champ, and calls out those people?\n\nThe 14-day ban doesn't reform, it punishes. There is no modification of behavior in removing something. It needs to be learned. If you believe 14-day bans and permanent bans are effective, then you also think the American prison system is a success.","replies":[{"poster":"OnlyYouCanHearMe","date":"2016-11-01T22:41:30.515+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Feniks,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=ZZkQvApM,comment-id=000200000000000000000000,timestamp=2016-11-01T22:08:27.435+0000)\n>\n> And what&#x27;s more trouble?

It assumes that the toxic person is automatically more skilled and correct if his/her opinion on how something in the match should be done differs from his/her teammates.  In my experience, many of the ragers are NOT in fact so much better at the game than the people they yell at.

Both are extremely frustrating and I think it's worth showing mercy after say a 6 month or 1 year period for them to really sit and understand what it means that there account will be gone if ANYTHING like what they did happens again.\n\nOn a personal note, I'm not much better than my team but things that make me rage are complete lack of warding all game or literally sitting there 3 feet from me while I try to 1v1, pinging for them to come with the hope they'll fire the ONE auto that I need to kill the person. Last game  I invaded and literally ran from 2 players past the midlaner and into our jungle where top and jg were sitting there twiddling their thumbs.  I only survived because they saw them sitting there and switched focus. Then we nearly get a double kill out of it but can't secure it because we started the fight so late. Midlaner of course didn't move and the support stayed bot. It wasn't enough to make me tilt because at this point I just expect everyone I'm matched with to be completely awful but it was enough to type what on earth are you guys thinking? Am I going to be alone like this all game? And the answer was yes, I was going to be. Was really glad I was on a Jhin and could pick people off from 10 miles away because I had zero peels and zero help.\n\nThe point being, whether it's ACTUAL skill differences or not. It doesn't matter. The frustration is what creates toxicity. And the frustration is due to people's inability to effectively teach the game (or at least how they think it should be played) in the span of one game to the person.  \"Please ward here, take this objective, watch the map, swing bot with me, etc. etc. etc.\" is conveyed as \"omg you suck\" \"are you dumb?\" and \"you fucked me over asshole\". Sure there's actual trolls and maybe the guy who ran down mid and called everyone a %%% shouldn't be allowed to recover. But the guy who got frustrated with his team probably deserves that one last shot.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"BetweenSkill","date":"2016-11-01T21:27:23.105+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":4,"body":"You don't follow the rules, you deserve to be banned.
