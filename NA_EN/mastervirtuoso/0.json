I don't know how this happens, but; the High Noon Jhin w passive mark stays on targets for the whole game and never goes away and the readability of when a target is marked or not is extremely bad. I am not sure if this is just limited to the High Noon skin.","replies":[{"poster":"MasterVirtuoso","date":"2016-05-21T04:34:53.394+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So far I believe this is purely limited to the High Noon skin, just played a fairly long game and no instances of the bug appeared. This bug occurs over the course of a game and I don't know the cause but it makes using the skin a handicap and I adore the skin, since it's the only Jhin skin.{{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}}","replies":[{"poster":"MasterVirtuoso","date":"2016-05-21T18:58:46.385+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So, i can't see to reproduce this bug any more...I do not know how it happened for those two-three games.
