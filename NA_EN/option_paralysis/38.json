You could clear waves like nothing with stacked E, it was an amazing feeling to destroy a minion wave, no matter how many are there. Now, a single fuckin&#039; fatass minion can block your whole dmg. I hate the Q bar too, it&#039;s telegraphed and in lane you&#039;ll never do it and enemies know your Q cd thanks to the bar filling up. He&#039;s still a balance nightmare anyway, either too good or too bad.\nBut, this Q animation I miss the most. :( Best skin in game before that fucking rework ruined it. Now you don&#039;t even see it, it&#039;s just some almost invisible one red line.\n\nhttp://s285.photobucket.com/user/joc_92/media/vlad1_zpspxtoz4x1.png.html","replies":[{"poster":"WitchQueen Annie","date":"2017-04-28T23:57:46.798+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"He continues to be SUPER safe when mastered. \n\nHis damage potential is now astronomical late game.\n\nHis presence in a team comp continues to nearly always ensure late game Scaling superiority. \n\nHis R is still game breakingly good and 2 second Tides of Blood is God.","replies":[{"poster":"Over Innsmouth","date":"2017-04-29T13:30:51.063+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Tides of Blood is God.\n\nWell thank you.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ßøss","date":"2017-04-28T23:51:44.829+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The skin shouldn't cost 1820 RP after they screw up the animations on the Q and at this point its better to use Soulstealer.","replies":[{"poster":"Asayake 5150glow","date":"2017-04-29T23:29:42.500+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Metasas,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=5iE64api,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-04-28T23:51:44.829+0000)\n>\n> The skin shouldn&#x27;t cost 1820 RP after they screw up the animations on the Q and at this point its better to use Soulstealer.\n\nBlood lord?\n\nI have that as a shard.","replies":[]},{"poster":"reaperteaser","date":"2017-04-29T00:31:58.353+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i like soulstealer, nobody can see the ulty at all","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"PePsiLemoNN","date":"2017-04-29T19:35:32.488+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"eqeqeqeqeqeqeqeqeqeqeqq so much fun so much counterplay","replies":[]}]}
