If you use stopwatch to dodge key cc and dmg, the enemies won't be able to stay under tower and continue the dive as most cc is not coming back in 2.5 seconds. Also, the delay stopwatch provides allows other players to crash towards the lane and add to a fight, making it very high risk to go after someone with a stopwatch.","replies":[{"poster":"Spank the Fox","date":"2018-01-23T16:41:51.298+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My point is that you made it out to be a deterrent against dives, but it also enables dives to happen more often because statis will remove aggro, which is huge when you have minions for the tower to reset on.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"BestJhinUniverse","date":"2018-01-22T05:20:52.482+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Been like that for years.
