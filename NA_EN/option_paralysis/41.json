I don't know how people fail to realize this but assassins are made to kill people. You pick an unsafe pick that gets countered and you can expect to die. \n\nSecond and biggest f*** up: You took ghost. You didn't make ANY attempt to pick a safe champion and then went ahead and didn't pick atleast a defensive summoner spell. Again, this is a case of: By every right you deserve to get one shot but you're still surprised and appalled when you do. \n\n\nAn extension of the second, you didn't even build defensively. Nope, you rushed a {{item:3165}}. Shit matchup, into bad summoner spells, and you don't even bother to try and rush an Hourglass or Banshee's veil. I'm even going to go as far as assuming that you took manaflow band and didn't bother taking Nullifying Orb for the magic damage shield. \n\n\nYou took no defensive options as a defenseless carry mage VS a class of champion that is designed to kill shit and nothing more, especially squishy carries. \n\n\nThis is basically the same as shooting yourself in the knee then complaining that you can't walk, no offense.\n\nOr perhaps a better analogy would be: You basically walked into a Lion's den, got your arse ate, then complained about the harsh wildlife. \n\n\nI'd also like to point out that your just stated you're new to syndra. You not only didn't take the right summoners, items, and probably runes, but you also lack the knowledge of how to play the matchup from a gameplay standpoint. \n\nEspecially in diamond ELO there is no reason why it would've turned out different.
