Every game vs. her is a damn chore. I gotta babysit my bot lane not to get ulted at 6 and get double killed. Then in teamfights that aoe stun ult is just insane. Her passive is dumb. Qss is cool yeah, but she literally has CC in every ability of hers. Like what the hell.

But call me crazy, what if instead of just spewing out a win rate and stats we looked up on some website we didn't design, what if we listed the reasons why we think Sej is too strong? Then after that we can compare her to her contemporaries (other tank junglers) to see is she too strong in comparison to them too? Then after the comparison we then listed possible suggestions on how to balance her. Seems more productive than just saying something is OP and then letting the community go crazy!\n\nI agree Sej is a bit too strong currently, but for me I think her Damage output as a full tank jungler is a good place to start! Most tank junglers cannot 100-0 an ADC 1v1, but somehow I have seen Sej do it multiple times! So I would start by some base stat nerfs on her skills, and maybe make her Winter's Wrath skill scale off the enemy max HP instead of her Max HP in order to allow the Carries some breathing room, while increasing her potential vs tanks!","replies":[]},{"poster":"MrHaZeYo","date":"2018-01-31T22:47:01.771+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"See has a AoE Stun ult?

The sustain you get from FF and overheal and a bloodthirster or BORK is insane.\n\nYou have to be delusional to think adcs aren't king in teamfights.\n\nThe most recent LCK game that just happened for instance: https://imgur.com/a/zjOpB   Vayne was comically far behind mind you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"zarxus1234","date":"2018-02-01T06:10:12.493+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"why nerf sejuani shes not even broken.","replies":[]},{"poster":"THE D1C","date":"2018-02-01T01:59:45.475+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Like...
