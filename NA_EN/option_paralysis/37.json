However, even on tanky supports you need to build those 2 items nevertheless. On playing other supports tho, I'll try but every time I play something other than Soraka and my adc is like 20% hp and needs to recall, I'm saying to myself: well, if I was playing Soraka, he'd be full hp right now.

And her heal / shield scales better with AP than + % heal / shield, so censor is a great add-on.\n\nFrom then you can pick whatever you need. I'll suggest lichbane if your team needs help to burst something asap (vayne is my go-to example), rylai if you need to peel against a juggernaut (you can almost permaslow with that by lategame), IBG if you feel the armor / slow could help you, or more traditionnal support items if you choose to. Or grab a NLR if you feel like it, since you scale really hard with AP.\n\nYou won't heal as much as soraka of course, and you'll never burst heal as well as soraka, but you become more of a team support - and an awesome one.

Since Exhaust got wrecked, I've been running Heal on my supports too, and it works great, so she can even add that too.\n\nThe problem is that nobody wants to play tanks or CC mages. It's all squishy assassins and mobility carries, so when they get caught (all the time), they die--often times even through an emergency Soraka ult.
