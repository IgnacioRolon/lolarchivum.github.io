There are also no paragraphs anywhere on the Boards that \"explain\" anything, there are only theories made up by players based on the assumptions THEY are making.\n\nHere is what I think: Riot tries to approximate a player's \"skill\" with a number. Then, when that player tries to play, it creates a pool of players that the system thinks has \"comparable skill\" and who are also currently looking to play. It has a set time in queue and once you exceed that time, it increases the window of skill delta that it includes in searching for comparable skill. It tries to make each game so that the chances of winning are 50:50.\n\nThis means (I have explained that before, but people just don't WANT to believe it) that the actual rank of a player is only very loosely correlated to their skill. Of course, if you are in the top or bottom end of the skill distribution, you will rise quickly or never (how top or bottom depends on the distribution of actual skill across the whole player base... something we will never know, but can only assume... e.g. normal distribution vs. logistic distribution vs. log-normal... even chess, where actual observations are much easier, since it is 1 on 1, does not agree how the skill of their player base is distributed). But for everybody else, it is just a random distribution based on certain facts of probability theory that I will not explain again (as people here don't give a fuck).\n\nThe LOL MMR system is optimized for one thing only: play time of players without having them quit. This is also the only rational explanation why Riot does not share the underlying algorithm... they know that if they WOULD share it, the motivation for people to play was significantly reduced, since it would become obvious that skill and rank are at best loosely related, and for the vast majority of players (around 80% - and I can prove all that, but you can too yourself and since nobody cared when I tried before, I'm not wasting my time again - and yes, the posts are deleted, for various issues I had while trying to explain) their actual rank between the lower middle and upper top (probably around Silver III to Diamond V) is one thing only: random. Every other game that has a matchmaking system that is intended to create fair games DOES share the algorithm, some even write papers about it since they are proud to have found a good approximation that works. Riot doesn't, because they are also proud, but for different reasons (after all, it made LOL the number one played game globally).\n\nAs a side note: the one thing you CAN do to actually rise in such an environment is to reduce the standard deviation of your actual performance - i.e. play always the same champ, try not to tilt, don't try new things, be solid / don't die etc. That is the one thing that will increase your chances of winning a tiny little bit until you reach a level that is more related to your actual skill (but really not too much, we are talking maybe 0.1 correlation at some significance of skill-sigma to win rate...).","replies":[{"poster":"BlaQ Goku","date":"2017-12-12T16:01:46.232+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would like to hear your explanation of your hypothesis.

The post(s) I deleted were about the details, and all the work that goes into explaining them is a bit lost if all you get is insulted :)  But happy to chat about the big picture, so to speak...\n\nNow, to answer your question, I THINK they base the 50-50 chance on MMR, understood as \"mean skill\" as measured by the system.\n\nAnd I also THINK that they do not take into account how the performance of one player affects others', nor how \"consistent or inconsistent\" a player is, i.e. you can think about the system how I envision it as something like a \"mean skill\" (that's your MMR in an ideal world, i.e. in cases where the system is able to accurately measure your actual skill... which is a topic for itself, as this is difficult to approximate and, likely, impossible to be 100% accurate) and then a \"standard deviation\" around that mean (that's how consistent you play), and then some sort of \"influence\" of one players' performance on others, e.g. if one deviates too far from the mean, other players will also play worse (that is what you observe, when the game gets sometimes lost because somebody starts feeding and then the rest gives up). Then you get the actual performance of all players in a given game, and the sum of that would be the performance of the teams... the one with the higher performance wins.\n\nI believe Riot only uses the MMR (i.e. the mean skill), and tries to create two teams with an equal (or, depending on queue times, more or less equal) total MMR. I also believe they try to make the individual MMR differences as small as possible (i.e., not have 1-1-1-1-6 but rather 2-2-2-2-2...).\n\nAs implied, there is no proof for any of what I think and believe. There is not even a HINT that Riot provides. The above comes from a LOT of research in probability theory and a personal passion for chess rankings... and as you know, those have been the basis for \"ELO systems\" in online games, but most of them are very flawed (since the ELO system is simply, in it's basic form, not suited for anything BUT a 1-vs-1 game of skill... and keep in mind, it is not only intended to create \"fair competition\" in chess games - it is intended to adjust the actual outcome in point changes to how fair the game WAS in the first place). It is basically how you would have to start designing a system that could work (and we have designed one with many parameters that is, potentially, much better, or it at least tries to be... although let's not start talking about what \"better\" even means... is it fair games? is it the best players can rise very quickly? is it all players play as much as possible and become addicted to the game? is it low queue times? There are so many variables that you can try to optimize, so you have to decide what you want to do first and then see whether your system is actually \"good\" at it... as I have said many times before, if I am Riot, I would want to design a matchmaking system - and a MYTH around it - that makes people THINK they have a chance to climb if they are good and play A LOT, and makes games on average just not TOO unfair, so that people don't quit altogether out of frustration. That's it! And under that assumption, the current system is probably working extremely well... and by the way, that also explains why they don't disclose how they do it... other games do that, they even try to do more than I assumed above, for example incorporate standard deviation around skill mean, or certainty about estimates, etc.).\n\nIn Riot's defense, though: as it is very difficult or even impossible, as said above, to actually correctly estimate the skill of players, and also the underlying \"skill spread\", if you want (that means: are the actual player skill values 1-100, with a normal distribution around 50? Or is it 0 - 10,000, with a logistic distribution around 200? or is it 1 - 3, with most players being 2? IS it even some sort of value, or is it more complicated?) - it's more possible in a 1-v-1 situation, but VERY difficult in a 5-v-5 situation, unless you have a ridiculously high amount of games, and even then, I don't know, it still depends on the degree of influence of one player's performance on those of the others... (which is why I said before, if I wanted to solve this, I would use a fixed group of 100 players, all Riot employees, and have them play exclusively within that group... and record ALL their games, for a LONG time... and have some sort of \"judge group\" give a \"non-numerical\" estimate of how well they play... and then take it from there). Without that, designing a system that has people play a lot is probably the best you can do. And IF that system even allows for progress over time, i.e. the more you play, the better you get, the higher you LIKELY / OFTEN climb, that means it is a good system! \n\nAnd, even more: you CAN argue that, since it is so difficult to actually ESTIMATE player skill correctly, I will ASSUME my system to be wrong about it... which in turn CAN mean, under certain circumstances, that the majority of players (since for all players, the system assumes the WRONG actual skill, as MMR) can \"climb\" by beating the system, so to speak, i.e. by being \"better then the system thinks\"... and if you use THOSE assumptions (i.e. your probabilistic model assumes the system is always wrong), the system I assume above does not work THAT badly... for many players, it will get to a point where the influence of the actual skill on the ranking is high... BUT \"many\" does not mean 99.5%, it means more like 60%... AND those 60% will change over time, i.e. you can drop in and out of that group.\n\nAnd LASTLY, certain things are NEVERTHELESS clear and they can be proven: \n\n(a) there is NO WAY in hell that the ranking is ANYTHING close to \"linear\", as the 100-point divisions and tiers seem to imply... it is WAY more likely that the skill difference is something like \"bottom tail\" (those who play so badly that they loose games by themselves), huuuuuuge middle, where really RNG has a higher influence on winrate than skill (i.e. one dude gets lucky and has a 53% winrate over 350 games, the other gets unlucky and has 47% over 350 games... is that super likely? No! Would I bet money on either happening? No! But it WILL still happen and in less extreme boundaries, it is very likely, especially with the ridiculously huge player population in LOL - again, we can prove it with a probabilistic model), and then some tiny fraction of elites. \n\n(b) there ARE statistical models that EXIST that can model 5-v-5 situations, influence of unknown variables on each other, etc. etc. - are they being used by Riot? No idea! Since they don't tell us what they are doing... \n\nSo, my biggest point in all these posts is: this is actually a super-interesting thing to fully understand, and it would be excellent to develop something that works \"best\" according to what you want it to do... but since Riot does not TELL us anything, we have no way to judge THEIR system :(  But still, back to my original point, if we ourselves spread the myth that \"somewhere it is proven to be awesome\", that just does not make any sense.\n\nOh, one last point: the model also proves, beyond any doubt, that what people consider to be \"ELO hell\" HAS to exist... where and when depends again on many factors, but it is \"extremely unlikely\" that it does not exist at all. It is very likely that there are actually multiple \"elo hells\" between all the tiers of the system :)","replies":[{"poster":"BlaQ Goku","date":"2017-12-15T18:09:17.705+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are a lot of variables when it comes to the MMR system, and I am not that versed in statistics (been a while since I took it in college). So you believe that the luck factor comes from how they determine and distribute a skill value to players, and therefore how those players of similar skill are distributed can determine your chances of winning?\n\nIt would seem that each game being a true 50-50 would be detrimental to climbing, and a true 50-50 would only be possible if Riot has detailed model for player skill. If its just a simple hidden MMR system, then winning adds points and losing subtracts points and the amount of LP you gain and lose is determined by your MMR compared to the division average MMR. Although this can be true for a detailed skill approximation system, it would make climbing slower due to a true 50-50 winrate (ex. you are silver, have a plat MMR but still play against similar skilled players to keep the 50-50 but gain more lp than losing lp on win/loss).\n\nSo basically, no matter the math, as long as lp gains are more than lp losses on win/loss, climbing should be possible, albeit slow.

So, if you were matched against a player of much higher skill and you'd win, you'd get more point... and not loose a lot at all if you lost (since that was expected). So over time, as chess players competed in tournaments (that means that even if you start with \"equal skill\", eventually, the winner will face better and better players...), the rankings would get better and better (as in \"more accurate\").\n\nSo, in a way, using a system like that to CREATE fair games in the first place is not logical at all.
