Advanced warning.\n\nInitial thought if tasked to come up with thoughts (on the spot) is that an entire class of characters designed to scale heavily into the late-game is almost at odds with Riot's ideal game length, which tends to be just short enough that many of these characters have to come online early enough that it begins to feel problematic in longer games. Either they come on too early, or their potential late-game power has to sacrifice enough early power that they're super risky to have in a team (not ideal, given how important they are to current objective-taking), or they have a powerful enough early game that it makes their powerful late game too accessible.\n\nIt sort of makes me wonder about designs you could take to flatten ADC growth past an an initial 20-25 minute \"spike\" so that they come online as major powerhouses around a certain time but cease to become a non-linear-scaling menace in a game of linear scalering as the game progresses: perhaps gaining additional defenses or tank-busting capabilities rather than simply increasing their overall power against every member of the cast. The problem is that most ways I can think of to do that either suffer clarify-wise, make itemization less satisfying, or reverberate down the rest of the cast significantly.\n\nAdditionally, any solution like that would involve killing off most of the hypercarries, but you could then emphasize that identity on one or two by unlocking their scaling in much the same way that Veigar/Nasus do -- Tristana and Kog'Maw seem good candidates for that, given their history. Might be a benefit to be able to put back some of those delineations.\n\nSorry, just sort of throwing out thoughts as they occur. Not really sure of this myself, but it was interesting to write up. :)","replies":[{"poster":"Done25","date":"2018-03-03T17:27:42.095+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":2,"body":"I can't help but feel ADCs need to pull away from 90% of their damage being based auto attack critting and more about needing to use their kits. So long as the ADC is a walking stat stick there will always be 1~3 \"best\" ADCS. They need to be individualized via their kits.\n\nI think Ashe is a good example with how her Crit hits increase the power of her slows. She's rewarded for building crit, but in a way that expresses her kit.\n\nQuinn is another good example. I think her passive could be reworked to: Scale off AD, have the ability to critically strike with her attack, and CD faster depending on how much attack speed she has. This rewards her for proper management of her minigame.\n\nSpeaking of minigame, how about that MF Q crit? It takes skill to pull off, but feels immensely satisfying to land a juicy Q crit on an enemy champ. Furthermore Riot could increase the Crit ratio on her Ult from 20/30% to 50/75% to let her scale into the late game that way as well.\n\nOh, and armor penetration needs to go die in a fire. It has never been a healthy mechanic and never will be. This can be seen with how it has been reworked not once, not twice, but THREE TIMES by now. You want assassins to burst squishy targets? Give them better AD ratios on their abilities. You want to increase their damage to champions specifically to keep wave clear in check? Make it so that Lethality instead reads: \"Deals +10% more damage to champions\".\n\nEspecially given with how well Armor Pen. synergies with the ADC item Last Whisper.

Rework crit.  Instead of crit being \"double damage(or x2.5 damage)\" rework it to just penetrate resistances.  Lets say 75%.  It applies to all damage dealt, not just auto attacks.  IE, and a complementary \"mage\" IE increases the pen to 100% resist pen.\n\nNow you may say \"But this breaks mages!\"  Put crit itemization that a mage could access to have low/no AP.   For example, Liandry's Torment would be 30 AP 20% crit.  Main thing being that if you opt into heavy crit on a mage, you will definitely suffer on squishy killing from low AP values of having 3+ items have fairly low AP, but you'd get to cut through tanks better.\n\n\nCompared to current crit, this is a nerf on targets with 125 armor or so, and increase that to 150ish with IE taken into account, but it does make it FAR better on someone stacking resist.\n\nBoom, now ADC (and crit mages) are showing a dedication to tank busting at the exception of squishy busting.  This also opens up certain aspects of currently ADC exclusive itemization to be attractive on mages that may quite enjoy the mechanics, such as Rapidfire Cannon for Twisted Fate or Shiv for a low waveclear mage.\n\n\nCrit becomes less snowbally (an early crit in lane won't massively spike damage, only minorly boost it), makes crit attractive as a stat on many different types of champions, and helps deshackle ADC away from \"Omni-burst\" to \"Good at killing tanks/objectives, but not bursting the rest of the team with the DPS required to kill a tank.\"","replies":[{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2018-03-03T14:42:11.826+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Steelflame,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=EeVEsMNI,comment-id=000b0003000000000000,timestamp=2018-03-03T07:27:53.041+0000)\n>\n> I actually thought of a fairly basic thing that covers the way to fix ADCs, and open up a rework of mage itemization to make tank busting a choice to opt into in the same step.

And to a lot of people in the community, it seems like it would be an incredibly easy task to nerf ADCs in those areas. It's no surprise that people are frustrated that we will have to wait several patches for (potential) changes to ADC damage when Riot hasn't even acknowledged that ADC damage is a problem.","replies":[]},{"poster":"xelaker","date":"2018-03-03T02:22:33.551+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":1,"body":"mid season. rofl. there's about 12 bazillion ways to alleviate the pains of league right now, but let's wait it out for the big change that'll turn the game inside out mid season.","replies":[{"poster":"Tin of sardines","date":"2018-03-03T02:50:19.765+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"did we have a mid season on patch 8.4???\nI mean, some champions have seem considerable changes, and a lot of itens gotta rework, nerf, buff...","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"option paralysis","date":"2018-03-03T02:41:06.998+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":5,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RiotRepertoir,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=EeVEsMNI,comment-id=000b,timestamp=2018-03-03T02:04:32.601+0000)\n>\n> We&#x27;ve already said we&#x27;re doing bottom lane work for midseason.

Then when the changes hit live it's suddenly \"we realized _x_ is doing too well and we're looking to bring them back in line.\" Up until then though we have to put up with backwards logic like \"paper is beating scissors when it should be the opposite so we're looking to nerf rock.\" It doesn't make any sense but that's all the information we'll get until again... Months later when riot actually acknowledges the issue by correcting it to any extent.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GodlyBane","date":"2018-03-02T23:37:33.138+0000","up_votes":20,"down_votes":5,"body":"1k dmg per crit vs trist with gathering storm and 2.00 atk speed (no joke)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Unreformed Shaco","date":"2018-03-02T23:55:16.816+0000","up_votes":20,"down_votes":16,"body":"http://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=Meddler\n\n\n\nEnough said.","replies":[{"poster":"AirKingNeo","date":"2018-03-03T00:20:16.671+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":8,"body":"He's a support player.
