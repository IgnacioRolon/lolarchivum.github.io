While you are correct that it is not \"hard numbers\" its a thing everyone experiences. \nThats not confirmation bias. A phenomenon that appears globally can be considered to be \"real\". Its the reason we think vampires were a real thing; Almost every ancient and classical culture has vampires, and those vampires almost universally have similar traits. The chance that any cultures which do not share a common cultural ancestor or have contact with each other would have similar folklore is _astronomically_ small. \nIts also why we think \"dragons\" as we know them didnt exist.

The way matching _should_ work, and used to work, is that each player would be individually matched with someone of their skill level. \nFor example; \nIn unbiased matchmaking the first person becomes the keystone.  Say theyre at 150 points, every other player would be around 150, resulting in an _even_ game across large numbers. With this kind of matchmaking, queues are dramatically longer in high ELOs (which is why the matchmaking system was changed in the first place). Game quality, however, is incomparably high and consistency is also much higher because its _actual skill based gameplay_. \n\nWhat riot has is a _biased_ matchmaking system for faster queue times. It works by matching 5 people _as a team_ then matching that team against other teams. The team score is similar, much like in unbiased... but heres the kicker; **based on your win rate your score is inflated or deflated, which increases your weight on the team score**. \nSay the teams are 1000. \nYoure a smurf with a 68% win rate and have a weight of _500_. \nYour mid laner on a 55% win rate has a weight of 200. \nYour jungler is on an even 50% at 150. \nYour bot and support duo on a 45% both have 75. \n\nThe parabolic matchmaking on paper is great, but in practice game quality has gone down dramatically. The only way to fix it would be to 'cap' your matchmaking score at say diamond 1 and have the ranks above diamond be actual leader boards where people compete for the highest scores instead of ranks. \nCapping your matchmaking score and giving visual flair to \"leaderboard\" positions also increases higher ELO skill base, because at that level youre capable of not only analyzing and learning from better players, but also putting it into practice. \n \n  \n> There is zero evidence of rigging that passes even the most basic statistical analysis.\n\nTheres no evidence of the contrary as well because this is the kind of data people write programs to collect because its _agonizingly tedious and complex_ , as each individual game requires you to keep track of so many variables.

The only significant changes to matchmaking was the additional of dynamic in season 6 which allowed for larger groups of players to queue together and role based mmr in season 8 so that players now have different position based mmr so a player who is plat 5 support can also be diamond in another role. The mmr difference between solo players in the matchmade roles are still within a small mmr gap (on average no more than 4-5 mmr) as shown by the link I gave you.\n\nAlso, outside of rare examples of smurfs early in their run (when they are pulling 80+% winrate) the worst players on each team has the most impact on which team loses solo queue. This means that if we allow for large mmr gaps between players, then the model you made up off the top of your head would cause winrates to diverge away from 50% with bad players sitting in the 20-30% and everyone else sitting at 55%.

So most devs use an arbitrary gap between individuals they feel is acceptable. I believe 3 to 1 odds being one of the more common values.  \n\nPersonal bias I have is that I think Riot plays it a bit looser in lower MMR to allow friends to play and its a painfully high range but.... Well I might be wrong on that. Recently watched a video on it and an Ex-blizzard dev was talking about how to rank friends (premade teams) and MM for them.\n\nPositional MM is a quality improvement for Mobas given the nature of roles.\n\n> What riot has is a biased matchmaking system for faster queue times. It works by matching 5 people as a team then matching that team against other teams. The team score is similar, much like in unbiased... but heres the kicker; based on your win rate your score is inflated or deflated, which increases your weight on the team score.\n\nCant say I agree with this. The concept of a MMR Value is that it sets a probability expectation from your MMR. So it wouldn't be using MMR values if WR with out context of K and MMR are considered. 75% out of 4 games is not going to eat the Lions share of a teams MMR.  I am more impressed by some one with 65% out of 200 games then some one at 80 in 10.\n\nFar as I know the system used takes 5 players MMR inside a preset range determined to be good enough then averages them into a team value and pairs vs another team that the same was done. This is done to give it more wiggle room to make quick games like you said. The quickest way is to give 0 consideration to overall K which generates more mismatches.\n\nOne issue I have with you stating WR matters is that many of the folks complaining about forced 50% do not have strong WR scores, by all accounts they should be given stronger teammates. Frankly, its not an accurate measure of some ones rating. Even in a more basic system like Elo this would be a problem.  \n\nPossibly just a misunderstanding because of how you worded it not matching the terms I am used to hearing. \n\nChallenger is a leaderboard of 200 players is it not?\n\n> Theres no evidence of the contrary as well because this is the kind of data people write programs to collect because its agonizingly tedious and complex , as each individual game requires you to keep track of so many variables.

Youd probably make mundo blush if you pulled it off.\n\nCurrently, Forced 50% is a direct contradiction of how Devs state the system works. That means Burden of proof is on any one making the claims. So evidence its being used is necessary.\n\n  Now I do have an opinion that individual match quality has taken a hit last few years. I blame Riots Behavior systems as being to soft. I  feel matches folks clearly give up and stop trying to win are far to fucking commonplace. Team games are not balanced around people wanting to treat it like a battleroyal and NEXT it.\n\nThere's an issue with stat generation for Moba, they have lots of noise where bad and good stats overlap. I don't think its remotely possible to really build a training set for Machine learning that would not be loaded with Bias issues. When you look at the permutations  its a pretty massive #. Then... to adapt information to use for MM?  Champion selection happens in lobby and cant be trusted as a prediction. The individual statistics required for succus vary by kits pretty drastically.\n\nI guess I would try to look at Gold Gaps between teams personally and see how much 1 player contributes... but I don't think that's a be all end all stat.  Would need the Data at hand to really toy around with it.\n\nThere is also the issue of a proactive MM system would need to search for correct variables to load games where as reactive systems work faster.\n\nSorry, topic I find interesting.

EA did it with targeting persons who suffer to control their compulsive tendencies down to a _literal science_. These kind of studies brought about changes to the way games are marketed and funded, directly resulting in what we have today where every game is pretty much constantly paying for a service, cosmetics, features, content, and often times even win. Hearthstone is a good example of how paying can be the difference between winning or losing. Activision patented an algorithm that they created which paired players without cosmetics and cash shop flairs/items with those that do, and over time it would offer the player sales for these items individually. A lot of mobile games do this too, and even League has its own \"My Shop\" feature that is different for each player based on the role or champs that they play often.\n\nIf you really think Riot isn't artificially roadblocking players in some way, shape, or form to keep them chasing that carrot then really it's just a matter of you believing that these corporations actually care about their playerbase and their shareholders are more interested in everyone having fun than they themselves making loads and loads of money....","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2020-02-01T00:38:58.158+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"EA does it with monetization.

People lose and get nowhere on the ladder, they pick up a new account to feel that sensation of doing really well again, and whoever makes and sells those accounts gets money. I can't confirm anything , there is no proof. I was only saying that if other large corporations and their shareholders push for scummy business practices it's not far-fetched to assume that Riot, in some way, is doing the same.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kai Guy","date":"2020-01-31T18:26:00.785+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sources to support your claims mate?","replies":[{"poster":"Waka FIocka","date":"2020-01-31T21:48:47.687+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Kai Guy,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=QX8wRpsA,comment-id=0000000000030000,timestamp=2020-01-31T18:26:00.785+0000)\n>\n> Sources to support your claims mate?\n\nFor Riot?

Whales is still slang for high micro transactions targeting individual accounts yes? So, Your talking about the  various business models involving RNG content via loot boxes and the monetization of F2P Via P2W I assume then?\n\nI did search. Couldn't find any EA stuff outside of the standard EA bullshit microtransactions and content.\n\nThe Activision [Patent ](https://charlieintel.com/patent-reveals-activision-uses-matchmaking-encourage-players-buy-microtransactions/)is claimed to not be in any games but its Activision, I feel like they murdered Blizzard so inherently I hate them and don't trust them. This might be unreasonable Bias but I want to be clear on it. The model looked like it was for P2W games to make the power of purchased items appear even stronger. Just having the patent is profitable if they sell the model to other companies end of the day. Mobile/FB games are extremely exploitative.\n\n> If you really think Riot isn't artificially roadblocking players in some way, shape, or form to keep them chasing that carrot then really it's just a matter of you believing that these corporations actually care about their player base and their shareholders are more interested in everyone having fun than they themselves making loads and loads of money....\n\nYea, I tend to stop supporting companies who treat their consumers as nothing more then a product they market to shareholders.\n\nFar as Riot goes, I think they stand to make more $ if they don't. The PR damage really just looks like a unnecessary risk if they go the way of Ea and Activision. Riot is screwed if they get caught manipulate matches rather then use actual Skill MM, they lose the ability to hold that carrot of what if you could become a professional Gamer! I wouldn't be surprised if down the road Clash turns into a Semi pro tournament with $ rewards behind a paywall.  Besides, they already accomplish plenty of Champion sales from smurfs doing the work for them showcasing champions played at different levels of skill.  Why risk the hot water for what win obsessed assholes will do on their own? \n\nI know Riot already has a \"slowdown\" implemented Via the LP system. It clearly moves at different pacing then MMR. Riots marketing team is ridiculous, They grew the IP so much that even some folks who quit the game are still times invested in lore and wait for new releases.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Mid Summoner","date":"2020-01-31T03:41:41.608+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MagicFlyingLlama,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=QX8wRpsA,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2020-01-30T21:59:20.662+0000)\n>\n> This is utter bullshit.\n> \n> Mathematically impossible as well, since it would need to do the same for every player.\n> \n> The much simpler explanation is MMR and confirmation bias.

HE had 80% wr in D4 with an acc that started the 1300mmr bs the give u on unranks with damn near Master tier mmr at the time. he had 4 players on his team with sub 30% wr sub 25 games. Clearly boosted accounts that were all dia and dia the season before and autofilled, and the enemy team not only had smurfs, but one tricks, and a higher avg mmr overall. And he said he needed his winrate to drop so he could actually get some decent teammates that he could carry who wouldnt just run it down. I've played this game for a very long long time averaging well over 1k ranked games a season since season 4. Its been like this for a very long time.\nlike unless you are duo smurfing u will get to a point much lower than your elo where u can't carry because the shitters the give u on your team weather its bronze, silver,gold, diamond, w/e. to jsut force u to play more. on top of that u have the meta which screws good players","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2020-01-30T22:00:15.706+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"A mixture of confirmation bias and how MMR works.

In this case, the biggest factor is probably the ease at which we see patterns. For the purposes of this discussion, let's assume a win has the same probability to happen as a loss.\n\nGetting three wins in a row and then three losses in a row has the exact same chance of happening as win, loss, win, loss, win, loss. Both of those have the same chance of occurring as win, loss, loss, win, win, loss. Whatever pattern of wins and losses you think would represent non-streaks or whatever pattern you would expect from a fair/perfect system has the same chance of occurring as every single other pattern of wins and losses.","replies":[{"poster":"Kai Guy","date":"2020-01-30T23:04:47.083+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"And as # of games increases Streaks end up being more likely.

But overall different face values on dice impact their average. So a string of rolls you would start to see the average over time.  Make a simple game, roll 10 dice in groups of 2. The group of 5 that rolls highest is the \"winner\".  You can see the impact on a majority when you throw outlier sided dice into the mix. All RNG but clear trends show up overtime.
