From plat 4 got to plat 1 80 lp and now I&#039;m only losing and after 6 games loss streak, I got matched against 5 man premade (I asked them) with all solo&#039;s on my team, maybe my bot lane was premade. I don&#039;t have to tell you they were going everywhere as 4 almost all the time and could coordinate ganks and taking objectives.\nNow, I don&#039;t understand what should I do when after 6 games of 0/10 adc&#039;s and &quot;idc anymore&quot; players, I get matched against a 5 man premade and of course I get smashed, when I play only solo. I&#039;m just stunned at this system and I really don&#039;t get how a billionaire company can remain oblivious to this and throw some 50% win rate statistics at me when I won&#039;t give a fuck, unless I can play solo vs. other people that play solo. It&#039;s really not that hard to understand. I have a solo badge and the fuck does that do ? Legit nothing if I have to constantly play against premades that fuck up mmr and the games are just not enjoyable on the winning or losing side if you&#039;re playing solo. I&#039;m not even mad anymore, I&#039;m just disappointed at riot and how they shove dynamic q on solo players. There would be feeders on pure solo q too, but at least I&#039;ll know we&#039;re on the same playing field, not on some weird fucking combination of mmr because premades fuck it up.","replies":[{"poster":"CaptainBlaulicht","date":"2016-08-09T22:29:05.119+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Git gud and smash em.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-08-09T22:24:28.553+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Only two of the enemy team appear to have a premade history with each other judging from their match history (though a first time premade is not impossible).
