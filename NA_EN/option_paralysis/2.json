People at olaf mains told me it&#039;s been like that since release. Can this be fixed ? Because it really ruins the skin without that powerful BOOM sound on his E and that heavy hard hitting sound on his Q.","replies":[{"poster":"semipriceysoap","date":"2018-10-04T20:58:59.092+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Option Paralysis!

I guess it's the second thing then. because I played one more game and when something else is happening close, you can't really hear it. I even upped the volume on the settings for that, but I guess his base sound is just so low. And yeah, lightning is tiny in game, that's too bad. Well, thanks though.","replies":[]}]}]}
