About 40-50% of his damage and combo ability is reliant on him landing his Q. If you dodge it or flash it, he won't have much left. Also, Lee is only highly effective for those who can make use of his high skill cap. The player in question has consistently played Lee Sin in ranked ever since season 5.

Most of his damage comes from his Q, R, and autos. Those are all single target abilities, with the exception of his R, but only if the Lee Sin can line up a kick to knockup multiple targets (which will happen more often for good Lee Sin players than bad ones). In the early game, he excels because of his fantastic dueling, high base damages, and exceptional gank ability. His usefulness kinda drops off later because the game no longer focuses on duels and lane ganks, but rather full team fights and picks. Lee is good at catching picks, but he often lacks the tankiness or escape tools to survive diving a team alone, so his playstyle generally focuses on catching out targets who overextend.\n\nThe difference between a good Lee Sin player and a bad one is that a good Lee player can extend Lee's usefulness into the late game, beyond flash-ulting the enemy carries. Lee is obviously a champion which relies on a large amount of mechanical skill. His kit naturally rewards high skill levels.\n\nNow, let's see what you said:\n\n\"People that say otherwise are delusional.\" - Ad hominem logical fallacy that stifles conversation and assumes your position as correct.\n\n\"He can play like a complete idiot and still escape every time he messed up\" - then you obviously aren't correctly responding to his mistakes. If he really is misplaying, you can easily land one CC ability on him and burst him down. He really isn't super tanky.\n\n\"Also very little counter play [sic] to a lee sin walking up, ward hopping into you and then Qing you in your face\" - why did you let him walk up to you? Even if he does it from brush, wards are a thing. There is no excuse for being caught out. He either outplayed you, or you were overextending without proper ward coverage. If you see him coming, you have all the time in the world to back off. Disengaging is the ultimate counterplay. Don't give him the opportunity to walk up when you have the disadvantage. The thing about his W is that he doesn't teleport to the ward instantaneously, it has a travel time. Yes, it's fairly quick, but during that time you can use a movement ability or flash away, or predict which direction he's going to fire his Q in.\n\n\"But the Lee Sin fan boys and Riot will forever keep Lee Sin top tier, sadly.\" - Wasn't there a thread called \"I know I'm going to get downvoted by X mains\"? It spoke precisely about this. I quote, \" Putting that in attacks the opposition, instead of trying to prove your point. You attack people who actually disagree with you, who aren't mains, by labeling them as something negative, and you're attacking those mains who are willing to have a discussion. You're saying that your argument is pretty much infallible, and the only reasons you're being downvoted is some asshole main who is too biased to see the truth.\"\nAlso, blaming Riot and the players who take advantage of a kit that rewards skilled play doesn't help your case. If Lee Sin is really broken, requires no skill, and can infallibly escape even after he's messed up, **why not take advantage of him?** It merely shows your inability to accept that you got outplayed. And what's this about being \"top tier\"? Lee Sin has the 115th highest win rate in League of Legends, meaning there are only about 20 champions who lose more often than he does.\n\nI rest my case.","replies":[]},{"poster":"FiddlesOnTheRoof","date":"2017-04-18T16:09:16.591+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"How can you say that when the statistics clearly contradict you?
