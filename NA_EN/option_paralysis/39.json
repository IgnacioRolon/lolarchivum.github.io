I was a support main, but since I demoted from d2 to d5 with literally unwinnable games and my 50k Soraka heals didn&#039;t matter jack shit, top lane again it is.\r\nI have a lot of games on Wukong, about 350k mastery and on Vlad about 180k, but I didn&#039;t play them ranked this season at all.\r\nMy question is what build and runes do you use right now ?\r\nRunes for Wukong were 15 ad, 9 armor, 12 mr, but recently I switched to lethality marks. And Vlad is pretty standard with ap, magic pen, hp/lvl and 20%cdr/lvl.\r\nI built on Wukong since always, ravenous hydra, I like the lifesteal and waveclear, then ghostblade - duskblade - cleaver and last item is situational on the game. I&#039;ve seen people just build full lethality cleaver without hydra... but then your waveclear is trash, however more dmg on squishy targets. Soooo, what do you build ?\r\nVlad build is pretty standard, but my issue with Vlad is that he needs time to scale and Idk how to pressure your lane early game when everybody just runs away from your empowered Q.\r\n\r\nAny advice is appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"Eedat","date":"2017-06-17T22:53:16.814+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've mained Wukong since season 3 but I'm only G4 so i dont know if you'd want my advice.\n\nHere's how my lane Wukong build works.\n\n* If I'm snowballing, I'll rush {{item:3142}} first because its a cheap early powerspike. {{item:3074}} is nice early, but be its 600g more expensive overall and the build path doesn't provide the same raw AD as the {{item:3142}} buildpath. If I'm still snowballing heavily I'll build {{item:3074}} second\n\nKeep in mind that Wukong scales extremely heavily with raw AD. This means he snowballs very heavily with kills. The {{item:3142}} rush is to snowball. If you dont feel confident, just get {{item:3074}} first because its a much better overall laning item.\n\n* {{item:3074}} is amazing on on Wukong because it solves two of his major issues which are sustain and waveclear. When/if I build  this in lane is situational. If I'm going even in lane and I'm getting pushed in a lot I'll buy it first. Or if I'm facing a champ with a lot of built in sustain themselves.\n\n* {{item:3812}} I would build this every game over {{item:3074}} if Wukong had decent waveclear. ***DD is better in every situation other than pushing.*** This item is amazing especially because I value CDR very highly on Wukong. Hands down better than Hydra if you don't need the extra waveclear.\n\n* {{item:3071}} I used to consider an absolute core 2nd item on Wukong before they changed it. The buildpath is abysmal on Wukong because you're sitting on only 15 AD from Phage until you complete the whole thing. The armor pen was also nerfed not too long ago. It does give a lot of great stats for Wukong. Like I said earlier, I very highly value CDR on Wukong.  The HP is more efficient because you get some armor/mr from your passive. Keep in mind though that Wukong's passive is more or less completely useless in the laning phase. I wish they didnt nerf the flat AD on BC so much. The armor shred passive synergizes extremely well with Wukong's kit.\n\nOverall I still build {{item:3071}} in most of my games. It's very situational as to when. Normally 2nd-3rd item. If I'm ***really*** snowballling and my team isnt feeding an enemy that can delete me, I'll skip BC\n\n* {{item:3026}} I find myself building this a lot as a 3rd-5th item. If you're ahead, the BF sword pickup is a huge amount of power because of how well Wukong scales with flat AD. He's a diver so the completed GA revive passive is amazing. This is a great item for Wu.\n\n* Dont forget you can pick up an early {{item:3155}} if you're having trouble in lane. {{item:3156}} is actually a quite good item on Wukong if you need the MR, but I normally wouldn't finish Hex into Maw until a 4th-5th item.\n\n* As top Wukong, I never build any boots other than {{item:3047}} {{item:3111}}....... {{item:3009}} are pretty shit in general and {{item:3158}} arent worth it IMO. You are a melee diver. You are going to take damage and be focused to some degree no matter what. Its not the same as playing a glass cannon mage. Keep that in mind\n\nYou have to keep in mind that you are still a diver. If you build glass cannon because you're very far ahead, but your team mate is feeding the enemy Syndra, you're going to get locked down, exhausted, and blown up in team fights. Keep in mind that glass cannon Wukong is better played as a split pushing assassin rather than a team fighter if there are fed enemy carries. If the threat level is relatively low though you can absolutely decimate entire teams. This is why I generally build Wukong ***slightly*** off-tank most games unless its a stomp.\n\nAn example build if I'm a bit behind would look something like this (in order):\n\n\n{{item:3074}} {{item:3071}} {{item:3742}} {{item:3156}} {{item:3026}} \n\n\nAn example build if my team is doing just OK:\n\n{{item:3142}} {{item:3074}} {{item:3742}} {{item:3026}} {{item:3156}} \n\nAn example if I'm snowballing out of control: \n\n{{item:3142}} {{item:3074}} {{item:3812}} {{item:3026}}  {{item:3071}}\n\nAn example build if Im getting absolutely crushed (Tank Wukong):\n\n{{item:3071}} {{item:3742}} {{item:3194}} {{item:3193}} {{item:3026}} \n\nI build at least two damage items before I consider buying a tank item. Full tank Wukong is complete trash unless you got absolutely demolished early and dont have a choice. If you get crushed, still grab {{item:3071}} first so you can at least spin cleaver stacks on the enemy team for your other carries.\n\nObviously you can swap out {{item:3742}} for an MR tank item depending on what damage you're taking.\n\n#Items I DON'T like: \n\n{{item:3078}} SUPER expensive, CDR is nice, extremely strong early in a 1v1, falls off heavily mid/late. Tri Wukong is fun but its more of a gimmeck like Triforce Darius. It can work but if it doesnt you're fucked. Super cheesy and risky. Your burst is pretty nuts with just a E>auto (+tri proc)>Q (+thunderlords) though\n\n{{item:3072}} Just NO. There is absolutely zero reason to ever pick this over Hydra or DD. Just dont.\n\n{{item:3147}} This item really isnt bad to be fair. I think its just slightly worse than {{item:3142}}. I wouldn't pick this up over Youmuu or DD ever, but I definetely don't consider it \"bad\" on Wukong. Might just be personal preference.\n\n\n{{item:3153}} Dont.\n\n{{item:3193}} Wukong with no damage is complete trash. You have to be ridiculously far behind to consider tank Wukong\n\n{{item:3053}} Meh. Keep in mind you have a .8 **BONUS** AD ratio on your E and Steraks only gives base AD. Wukog also doesnt have fantastic base AD to begin with for this item to multiply\n\n\n\nIf you want I can go over lane matchups too","replies":[{"poster":"Sun Wu Ryuumoku","date":"2017-06-17T23:42:13.763+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> {{item:3147}} This item really isnt bad to be fair.

How do you pressure your lane early with Vladimir, you don't! Trust me, until you hit level 9, you don't have enough kill - potential to end your opponent.
