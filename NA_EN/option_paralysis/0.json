This new runes system is going to be so sweeping across all lanes, all playstyles, all strategies that we use in every period of the game... This is really risky by Riot, in my opinion.\n\nI know that sounds dramatic but honestly the latest reveal of Summoner Specialist is just that, a sweeping mechanical change.

We're also limiting other in game changes coming out at the same time beyond the super necessary stuff for the reasons you describe. We'll do our best to keep you guys as updated as possible on what we're going to do around runes balance, etc. We've had multiple teams focused on playtesting and balancing already, but we know that we can't 100% cover everything internally that the...well..._lots_ of you will experience and discover (big shout out to Playtest team and Live Gameplay for all of their help so far). \n\nThis was one instance where we simply couldn't keep making incremental changes to the runes & masteries systems though. It could only take us so far. We've mentioned before that keystone masteries were an early test for some of the things we want to achieve with these new runes. One of the things this test showed us is that if we ever wanted to follow through on having meaningful pregame decisions (which you guys have been rightly asking for) then it would require some big changes to the _rules_, not just new content.  \n\nWe do know that impactful runes like Summoner Specialist are scary (and hopefully exciting for some players?), but we're hyper aware that these are big changes and are committed to monitoring and reacting over Preseason. Some of the runes we've already talked about have already been changed or edited since because everything we're showing is super duper work in progress. I know that actions speak louder than words, so I don't expect you to take my word for it here, but I did want to put all of this out there for you guys.","replies":[{"poster":"Jeddy017","date":"2017-08-25T00:04:10.517+0000","up_votes":27,"down_votes":3,"body":"I think with such big changes, you guys SHOULDN'T start the season early like you did last year.\n\nStarting the season in December will only give you guys less time to moniter & balance stuff.
