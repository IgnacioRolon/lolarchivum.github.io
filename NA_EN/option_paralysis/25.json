This is mechanic of \"you put me behind but I have a button that puts me even or ahead of you so I can kill you and be ahead without ultimate\". He uses W and it's over you have no attack speed, no movement speed, you can't kill him with abilities alone as he lifesteals hard, plus lifesteal also is doubled during ultimate cause he has Q twice as often.

I think his W could use a better healthier mechanic, but I rather not have his Ult buff reverted, he's been in a rough spot before this ult buff. The best I can see is to make it so instead of a flat 50% CDR on his Q, he gets 25%/30%/50% Q CDR reduction to make it more...healthy I guess.
