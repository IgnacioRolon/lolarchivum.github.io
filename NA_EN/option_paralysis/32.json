Sure assassins can be op too if you cant position against them but Fizz ult is a slow skillshot.\n\nThe issue with the ADC being the primary DPS is that it's effectively an Arms Race. If your ADC sacrifices any DPS for durability, they will deal way less damage to enemy champs/structures/neutral objectives compared to your opponent. \n\nAs for positioning, that limits where the ADC can actually be without good vision, and they really can invest in vision without sacrificing DPS. (which is why the support supplies the vision) Also, if your primary method of dealing with better duelists is \"kite to death\" then you would effectively be losing ground when you kite, until the point where the poke starts adding up. (And that could be a while against a tank or fighter) And because they can't \"Stand their ground\" they become quite poor a defending objectives.\n\nIf you can't tell, I'm pretty much discontent with playing an ADC. They lose so much in their independence, making it difficult to actually turn a fight around if things go south. But it's technically a fair trade off for their superior objective taking power. And on top of that, because they are so DPS oriented, they become completely useless when they fall behind.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Rock MD","date":"2017-04-21T20:18:30.288+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"ADC in 2k17 came about because Poppy would build a Sunfire Cape and you couldn't even dream of damaging her until 5 items in.\n\nPeople who use it to refer to getting wrecked assassins are stupid.","replies":[{"poster":"Melledoneus","date":"2017-04-21T23:40:26.027+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm a general advocate of tanks, but even I can't defend the inherent bullshit that is Poppy.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Karfuss","date":"2017-04-21T22:55:59.302+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"A squishy assassin ruining an ADC's day is more than fair.\n\nA tanky bruiser with one or two offensive items doing the same, is far from fine.","replies":[{"poster":"Academy Kayn","date":"2017-04-22T03:14:58.538+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"> A tanky bruiser with one or two offensive items doing the same, is far from fine\n\nIf you're complaining about damage by Tanky Bruisers, it really doesn't take much damage to kill a squishy ADC...If you're talking about them in general, that's why ADCs have a team and a front line.

These days almost every viable damagechamp has some sort of gap-gloser. It is also the reason why Lucian and ez are so popular","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zerenza","date":"2017-04-22T10:02:21.320+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I often don't see that said about assassin's killing ADC's, it's usually when a tank does. If an assassin kills an adc, that's completely fair, no ammount of  defensive itemization should realistically protect a squishy adc from an assassin. Not to mention i don't get the meme that much either cause when i get two shot by vayne as an assassin i'm salty as fuck, and she isn't the only adc that can do it. I love taking 1000 damage from a single, undodgable auto attack, it gives me sustenance.","replies":[{"poster":"Champion Skin","date":"2017-04-22T23:41:45.622+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahh yeah... well it was really fun that one time I killed the enemy Ezreal as Tahm support 1v1... with the only damaging item I had was {{item:3742}} \nThough it did take a while because of him having {{item:3025}} {{item:3153}} to try and kite me (but no MR or HP items)\n\nWell it probably did help to that I had 600 more gold and was 1 level higher and Ezreal mostly just ran instead of fighting back (but wasn't able to escape obviously since I killed him 1v1)\n\nHere's the match if interested\nhttp://matchhistory.eune.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/EUN1/1692336356/35858965?tab=overview (it was around 38 min on the timeline)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ahri a Stark","date":"2017-04-22T20:55:58.683+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=tough noogies,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Y1GFkl8Y,comment-id=,timestamp=2017-04-21T18:37:03.896+0000)\n>\n> Every time someone one shots an ad carry, everybody&amp;#039;s like &amp;quot;haahha adc&amp;#039;s LUL&amp;quot;.

She had 0 MR built, pure dmg, so why should a caitlyn survive through his full burst ?\n> If I play a full ad melee and get one shot, everybody&amp;#039;s like &amp;quot;well retard, you&amp;#039;re playing full ad&amp;quot;. So, why the double standard for adc&amp;#039;s ? I don&amp;#039;t get it. If cait bought maw, she&amp;#039;d survive, just as I buy a maw if I&amp;#039;m playing against a fizz or something on a melee champ. I understand the AD DAMAGE CARRY, but I&amp;#039;d rather survive and fight longer than build full ad and cry how nobody should be able to touch adc&amp;#039;s. Maw gives decent dmg anyways.\n\nThe Problem is:  there is nearly no counterplay as adc\n\nFor example the enemie has Syndra.. what the fck can i do vs syndra as an adc?\nsometimes i get os just with her ult and a q who didn't even hit me.\n\nYOU CAN'T JUST BUILD MAW.
