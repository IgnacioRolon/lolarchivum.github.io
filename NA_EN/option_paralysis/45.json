I love this skin, it was one of the best skins in game before you &quot;updated&quot; it with his rework.\nWhen you get into the game, you really don&#039;t feel the &quot;blood lord&quot; vibe in anything other than his voice. His splash art is also amazing, but in game it just doesn&#039;t live up to it.\nhttps://imgur.com/jb2RKjF\n\nAlso, look at this animations. That old big one was the reason I bought the skin. When you Q-ed someone, you really felt like you&#039;re taking their blood.
