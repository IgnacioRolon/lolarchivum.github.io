She does the Skill outplay moves that RIOT wants to show the world as a representation of their game, she flashy, fast and looks super fun to play. Wukong is a Champion that is more about one engage. Thats boring to watch. That makes people think the game might be boring. \n\nRIOT is balancing around this for years. They want to keep Flashy Champions on the top and boring champions down.","replies":[{"poster":"saltran","date":"2018-11-29T13:03:27.420+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":9,"body":"Yeah that's why they balance to have pro play filled with {{champion:238}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:105}} {{champion:55}} {{champion:92}} amirite?","replies":[{"poster":"Saezio","date":"2018-11-29T13:07:23.403+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=saltran,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=9oXgJ5Oj,comment-id=00010001,timestamp=2018-11-29T13:03:27.420+0000)\n>\n> Yeah that&#x27;s why they balance to have pro play filled with {{champion:238}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:105}} {{champion:55}} {{champion:92}} amirite?\n\nwhy pick those when\n{{champion:7}} {{champion:39}} {{champion:84}} {{champion:266}}  are just better?\n\nYou cannot deny they have pushed any tank/stalling champion out the meta though.\nWhere are the maokais the nautilus the azirs the sivirs the corkis? they want fast games.\nSure not ALL the assassins got in but more than any other year in worlds\nAMIRITE?","replies":[{"poster":"saltran","date":"2018-11-29T13:19:21.142+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":">sivirs \n\nUnironically she was quite good on Worlds, but well remember that last Worlds we had the Ardent meta with enchanters-adcs and tanks everywhere, it's not that terrible that this year we had Worlds ruled by solo lanes right? \n\nNot saying that you cant complain about meta, I do aswell, but I wont pretend that it has always been like this.","replies":[{"poster":"Saezio","date":"2018-11-29T13:33:18.024+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=saltran,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=9oXgJ5Oj,comment-id=0001000100000000,timestamp=2018-11-29T13:19:21.142+0000)\n>\n> Unironically she was quite good on Worlds, but well remember that last Worlds we had the Ardent meta with enchanters-adcs and tanks everywhere, it&#x27;s not that terrible that this year we had Worlds ruled by solo lanes right? \n> \n> Not saying that you cant complain about meta, I do aswell, but I wont pretend that it has always been like this.\n\nDon't get me wrong I hated ardent meta even more. I liked the meta back in season 2-3-4 a millions time more. \nWere there a lot of sivirs at worlds? I think there was not a single ban on her but yeah I guess my example was not that hot. \n\nI also kinda liked the meta with awesome dudes bot.
