At the end of the day, it all depends on how a majority of people feel about a particular champion, not just one or two people. It also depends on what the statistics look like. If Riot feel a particular champion is way too overpowered, then they'll just give that champion a nerf or two. If they feel a particular champion is way too weak, then they'll just give that champion a buff or two. Don't forget this is their game lmao and if they feel a certain champion requires certain changes then I guess you just have to accept that and try to adapt to it.","replies":[{"poster":"WoonStruck","date":"2016-07-22T07:47:32.558+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Meanwhile Ryze. \n\nHe's just as much of a mess as Vlad has been.

It being \"their game\" does mean quite a lot. If you got banned, would you casually just sit there and say, \"Oh, they banned me. This doesn't mean anything. I don't care.\"..? You wouldn't, right? Also, I find it pretty hysterical to watch you point out the obvious. Clearly everybody KNOWS that if Riot doesn't meet some of their high expectations, they're pretty much not going to be happy, are they? And to further add on to that, if the game is supposedly going \"downhill\", how or even why are you still playing the game?\n\nIn addition, I'm just going to put this out there, Vlad sucks. Vlad sucks, big, hard, balls. You're complaining about Riot failing to make a particular champion such as Ryze good without being broken and yet you want them to do the same for \"classically problematic champs like Vlad\". If anything, there are WAY more worthy champions out there that Riot could pay more attention to such as Kassadin rather than champions such as Vladimir.

It means I'm likely to drop it in the future due to its current state and direction. I play less than 1/10 of what I used to.\n\nVlad fills a more interesting design space (when done well) than Kassadin. Kassadin has mobility as his ult, and it has an extremely low CD. That's about as interesting as Kass gets. Tell me what exactly is interesting about Kassadin except his power-curve, which Vlad shares in general. \n\nPeople hate playing against a Kass that's a major part of a match more than they hate playing against Vlad.

Literally just quit playing the game right now and then you don't have to kick up an unnecessary fuss about the game. I literally cringe every time I look at my notifications on the forums, only to see you complain about something as minor as how the current state of league is. Like come on man, don't be that guy.\n\nMoreover, did you really just put the words \"Vlad\" and \"interesting design space\" in the same sentence? I'm disappointed man. I'm really disappointed. And if you're so curious as to what's so interesting about Kassadin except his power-curve, why don't you tell me first what's so interesting about Vladimir, huh?\n\nLast but not least, dude, come on. Many people would agree that they hate playing against a Vlad. He literally takes no skill to play and he was just downright strong in Patch 6.13 or whatever. All you have to do really to get a simple triple kill or so is just use your Q, your ult and your items as much as you can because they are the things that can give you a shit ton of health.","replies":[{"poster":"WoonStruck","date":"2016-07-28T07:20:41.156+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't fail to realize it, you are just very poor at making points. \n_____________\n\nLeague is still a game I want to see grow, and it will not continue to grow with its current direction.\n\nSeriously, fuck you if you think I, or anyone else, shouldn't have the right to want a game they used to like become 'better', even if 'better' is subjective in most cases. \n\nYou're the one being 'that guy'.

Nerfs like they're currently giving don't accomplish anything as far as the reason the champ is being nerfed, but they do pile up over time and make the champion unusable after a while. \n\n______\n\nIf you disagree, do tell me what these nerfs will be 'fixing' on Vlad. His mobility certainly isn't out of line. Considering he's usually running Ghost/Stormraider's and has Rylai's, the MS tap will hardly affect him. It might push more people into using MS quints to cover early laning pressure with CR procs, though. \n\nThe W nerf actually accomplishes nothing, especially when champions like Azir (in competitive) get by without getting hit for similar reasons. Its adding less than 10% CD to a 20+ second CD ability. That's not noticeable. Later on in the game, you often can't pool a second time before a fight is over anyway, and he'll often be running Zhonya's either way. All it does is hit his clean-up potential after 5 ranks in W+40% CDR, which isn't why Vlad is being nerfed in the first place. It makes him weaker without fixing any problems. That's simply not a good balance philosophy.","replies":[{"poster":"a very bad nado","date":"2016-07-29T19:09:15.267+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"How am I \"cursing\" you \"needlessly\"..?
