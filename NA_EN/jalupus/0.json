I experienced this first in an URF game with some friends and we nearly lost the game. They thought I was crazy because I was saying i literally could not damage the nexus. Later on in the game I attempted to backdoor again but upon activating my ult, I could no longer deal damage to the nexus until the duration of Rat-Ta-Tat-Tat! was over. I can confirm that there was a middle inhibitor destroyed on the second attempt.\r\nMy buddy and I then went into a custom 1v1 on a regular gamemode (non URF) and tested out the bug. I first shot the enemy nexus 3 times as Twitch and was able to damage the structure. Then I canceled my auto attack, activated Rat-Ta-Tat-Tat! and then proceeded to reattack the Nexus. I was no longer able to damage the structure until the duration of Rat-Ta-Tat-Tat! was finished.\r\nEven upon entering Twitch&#039;s regular basic attack range with Rat-Ta-Tat-Tat! on, I was still unable to damage the enemy nexus.\r\n\r\nThank you for all you guys do, let me know if you need clarification.\r\n- Kaibz Jalupus","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2015-04-13T07:31:38.299+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":2,"body":"Thanks for the report, that bug should be fixed in the next patch (5.8), barring any unforeseen problems.","replies":[{"poster":"Kobold","date":"2015-04-13T09:39:10.701+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":0,"body":"What?!

Riot missed that becuase when twitch ults its to get kills and not take nexus. Also Twitch is an adc that has been forgoten in some games since he only get a power spick from items and no lvls and Kailistia is a better version on her with out the stealth.
