This visual effect however is a problem for Shaco as it gives a constant, easily recognisable differentiation of Shaco and his clone, this removes any of the mind games that were once possible through his ultimate. With the red and blue buffs you can just not ulti while you have it. I'm not sure if this was done purposely to force people to only be able to play ad Shaco however I am one of the few ap Shaco players and find it quite frustrating that this is only really affecting this play style of the character.","replies":[{"poster":"Pæan","date":"2015-02-13T04:57:19.582+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":0,"body":"Having any buffs as Shaco gives you away, but yeah, the constant dragon buff is more annoying.\nThey just need the clone to be an EXACT clone.
