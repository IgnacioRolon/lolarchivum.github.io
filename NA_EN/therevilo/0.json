It will only happen once a game. So my problem is my game screen will freeze, preventing me from tabbing out or anything, although my music is still playing in the background. and i can still see my mouse and am able to move it. it usually only lasts a minute or two, but it can happen at any point. it is extremely annoying, and i was wondering if anyone knew of a problem like this and what i can do to fix it.\n\nThanks","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-03-18T02:48:37.259+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When your game freezes up for any reason, it's typically a sign that there's something weird going on with your drivers or game files.
