You&#039;ve said the same for January , and it didn&#039;t happen . The last thing you said about him , was that he will get something in February , it's time  . \n\nAs an Aatrox main with a good winrate on him , i don&#039;t mind that much .

They were also talking about reworking him in the divers update this year , but if you read the latest dev blog post , they've said proudly that tanks/vanguards are next on the line for a class update and aatrox is clearly not one of them . \n\nSome buffs they could give him without making him overpowered are just some simple buffs : +30 or 35 base HP and +4 HP/lvl and also give his Q a static cooldown of 14s . \n\nHis live version of it is : 537 hp +85hp/lvl and Q has a CD of 16/15/14/13/12 s . I think that this wouldn't make him broken or overpowered as everyone likes to think .","replies":[]}]}]}
