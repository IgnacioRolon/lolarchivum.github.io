How did he outsmart the demon? Appearantly he doesn't know of Kled, what would happen if they met? What are his exact relations to LeBlanc and the black rose? How would an encounter of him and either Urgot or Irelia go out after everything that happened? Honestly for some I would prefer a comic or cinematic/music video because one thing we really haven't seen is how Swain would emote in such situations. I mean it's pretty much a given that in most cases he would keep his composure, but I'd like to see a story where a bit of his emotional side might shine through. A story about him trying to reclaim the Leviathan would also be interesting, though it would honestly be REALLY hard for Gangplank to have any sort of chance of defeating him. Swain is cunning, intelligent, mostly serious and cruel while also having the power of knowing almost everything on Runeterra. Not only that but the demon is also able to expell eldritch magic at a fast rate, that would be really hard to survive for a \"normal\" human like Gangplank, who mostly has his pistol, sword and barrels. Maybe he would use his ship in that battle too, if it were to be overseas.","replies":[{"poster":"Moggy","date":"2018-04-15T12:25:31.099+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean the whole point of Gangplank's achievements like stealing the Leviathan and stuff from Zed's clan is to show how cunning and dangerous Gangplank is.","replies":[{"poster":"Chase Me Daddy","date":"2018-04-16T07:07:15.050+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know. And I respect Gangplank for that. He ruled an entire region for years without real contest. The man survived everything up to this point, even being dethroned and having his arm destroyed in the explosion of his own ship. But I think Swain and Gangplank might be on the same level in terms of intelligence and cunning. Depending how a fight might play out they might be even, which would still be awesome to see. The thing that Swain has over Gangplank is his demonic abilities, if a situation is grim enough Swain would fight for himself instead of hiding behind soldiers. And Swain might already know what Gangplank is up to before a fight even beginns. Still, as you've said, it would be interesting to see that despite Gangplanks disadvantage how he could outsmart even an ability as powerful as the demons knowledge.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Whyte Lyon","date":"2018-04-14T22:55:55.654+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> So even after the Swain rework it's still canon thst Gangplank stole the Leviathen from him.
