So today I wanted to play league but whenever the download finishes on the browser( Google chrome) nothing happens when I click on the download. I'm on Windows Vista Home Premium OS, it's a 64-bit OS, with 8 GB of RAM. Processor is Intel(R) Core(TM) 2 Duo cpu 3.00 GHz","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-15T23:32:14.920+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Heeeey those specs are still pretty good, you should have no problems running League as far as I can tell!\n\nHmmmmm that download not responding when it's done is a little concerning though. It might be that Windows is blocking the program from running because it doesn't recognize it as a safe download, so try going to your download page and opening the download from there. If it's still not working, we may need to update your [**permission settings**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) to allow League to run.","replies":[]}]}
