Lose and you get barely half. Id have enough IP by now to buy the champs i want if it wasent for this garbage and over all the tilt dosent match the reward and feels more like a shore to level up rather than actual fun.\r\n\r\nAnyway thats my opinion on it, your entitled to your own or it might just be my luck but on top of all the toxic bs , the tilt and now being forced to level up to get shitty rewards? f that. if enything id say this is so people get inpatient end buy rp.

That brings your new effective value to 1700. *20 more than your expectation.*\n\nLets now assume your second chest is a 6300 champion (1260 value, 3780 cost, 2520 savings). While you wouldn't be able to afford it yet, upgrading that shard would bring your effective value to 3100. *1420 more than your expectation.*\n\nNow, there are 13 450 champions out of 139 total. That means each chest has about a 9% chance of pulling a negative value in this scenario.\n\n------------------------------------\n\nIf your intention is to upgrade as many shards as possible (You can't upgrade them all), this system will give you significantly more *effective* ~~IP~~ BE.\n\nIf you want a *specific* champion, however, you're stuck either waiting for the 0.7% chance of getting it in a chest, or disenchanting everything else you get (negating all savings).","replies":[{"poster":"Tactrix","date":"2017-11-10T08:01:11.050+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I don't think you understand so let me clarify.

That's the first thing the second thing is if you are lucky enough to get a champ you still don't have access to set champ, because you still have to activate the perm version of them, they aren't activated, they are just the SHARD of the champion, meaning you still need the essence to actually activate them afterward. Maybe now you understand how much of a ripoff it is. And on top of all that since champ shards are random 90% of the time the only thing you'll end up doing with them is breaking them into essences.\n\nThe bottom line is right now you get less essence and a CHANCE at a champion shard that you might want to use, which if you want specific champs is just near impossible.

So I assumed 580 was the value of your chest. (shard value + BE = 580).\n\n>because you still have to activate the perm version of them \n\nThat's why I increased the scenario to 2 levels with only 1 upgraded (on the assumption that every chest had at least 1 shard). That way the lowest tiers were unlockable for a more static base line.\nAnd even if you don't unlock the champion immediately, any champion upgraded effectively increases the value of the chest it came from. So a 6300 champ shard is worth 2520 BE *if* you intend to upgrade it; regardless of when you actually do.\n\nI'd still estimate that the average effective value in this system, assuming you upgrade as many shards as possible, is greater.\nThough I concede that the potential for shardless chests could noticeably degrade the degree of improvement, since I was working with an only 9% chance for negative values.\n\nActually, I'd like to put a call-out.
