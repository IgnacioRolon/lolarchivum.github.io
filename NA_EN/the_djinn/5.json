Take a moment to view the Veigar particle updates, if you haven&#039;t yet: [here&#039;s a friendly link.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fd_d99TsDaw)\n\nThe particles in general look amazing, but I&#039;d like to talk about Veigar&#039;s ultimate, which can be found at 0:23 into the video, and again at his full combo immediately afterwards. I&#039;m a bit concerned that, visually, his ultimate has such low impact compared to his other effects. It&#039;s an extremely powerful nuke and an important effect to see go out in a fight, so having it be so overshadowed by other abilities makes me a bit concerned that this high-impact spell will be frequently unnoticed.\n\nWhile the bright flash on Veigar is big help, it feels like either the particle or the impact on an enemy champion should have a bit more visual kick behind it, because it currently doesn&#039;t grab the attention as much as such a high-power spell should, especially when it has to pass through the complex visuals created by his stun cage.\n\nIs this just a me thing, or do others find it equally hard to track compared to his other effects?","replies":[{"poster":"Step Sis Lux","date":"2018-09-12T15:03:35.361+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":3,"body":"im the only one who has no problem with seeing his R? lol","replies":[{"poster":"Cute Cuban","date":"2018-09-12T15:14:52.009+0000","up_votes":29,"down_votes":0,"body":"It looks less damaging than his auto attack lmfao.
