Here&rsquo;s a quick rundown of the major changes, although we encourage *every* board member to review the rules and read the new additions:\r\n---------------------\r\n#MAJOR RULES CHANGES\r\nWe&rsquo;ve added three new specific rules &ndash; while all of these rules were implied by previous rules, we&rsquo;ve called them out specifically as these are things that we&rsquo;ve heard pretty loudly players want to see less of (well, nobody was begging for a &ldquo;No sharing personal information&rdquo; rules, but it seemed important).\r\n\r\n\r\n**Gameplay and Rank Shaming [Added]:** No belittling or shaming a player for their champion pool, rank, playstyle, or match history.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Pejorative Language [Added]:**  Do not use language intended to express contempt for an individual on the basis of ethnicity/race, sexual orientation, political affiliation, gender, religion, etc. This includes, but is not limited to, examples such as &ldquo;gay&rdquo;, &ldquo;retarded&rdquo;, &ldquo;autistic&rdquo;, &ldquo;cuck&rdquo;, &ldquo;jew&rdquo;, etc., even if intended humorously or jokingly.\r\n\r\n**Sharing Personal Information [Added]:** Do not post personal information belonging to yourself or another player. This includes, but is not limited to, the following: real names, addresses, e-mail addresses, phone numbers, Facebook profiles, etc. The sole exception is for streams/fan pages/names belonging to individuals who have opted to reveal this information to the public.\r\n\r\n\r\n**The Good Stuff [Added]:** A section detailing some positive board behaviors that are great to aspire to. It&rsquo;s worth reading, as if your post is adhering to these principles you&rsquo;ve got nothing to worry about. If it looks a bit like the Summoner&rsquo;s Code tweaked to apply to the boards, well&hellip;\r\n\r\n-------------------\r\n#ORGANIZATION CHANGES\r\nYou&rsquo;ll see three sections (Good Stuff, Bad Stuff, and Really Bad Stuff) to help convey which behaviors we consider most problematic, some more links to the moderation discord and/or player support, some wording changes for clarity, and a nifty new drop-down format.\r\n\r\n-----------------------------\r\n\r\n#[You can find the updated Universal Rules here.](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/community-moderation/ITFIpNUE)","replies":[{"poster":"Altiverse","date":"2018-06-12T10:10:20.875+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":8,"body":"> Do not post or engage in discussions of religion, ethnicity/race, sexual orientation, gender, politics, or real-world social issues.\n\nReally?

It is simply more visible due to the new format.\n\nThe reason that rule is in effect is it's our experience, after several experiments where we allowed threads about those topics, that they almost unanimously spiral out of control and we are forced to take action, often against individuals whose behavior is otherwise perfectly fine, but who get pulled into these volatile topics.\n\nEvery now and then we take a look at this rule to see whether it needs to remain, and if we see a notable increase in how frequently these threads are handled appropriately when they are allowed, we may consider adjusting this rule.\n\n> Will these words be banned only if used in a **pejorative manner**? I&#x27;m quite literally a jew and a bisexual person irl, and seeing two of my identities in a &quot;these words are offensive&quot; list once again leads me to believe something went horribly wrong down the line of the decision making here.\n\nSaying \"I'm Jewish and I'm bisexual\" or \"my gay friend loved the rainbow poro icon\" is fine. Saying \"typical bi jew\" in response to someone's opinion wouldn't be.\n\nSo yes, there is some discretionary space if you're using words non-insultingly. The reason we pushed this rule out, however, is that we saw a lot of instances of these terms used insultingly and wanted to clarify that thay isn't okay.","replies":[{"poster":"BobaFlautist","date":"2018-06-12T20:08:41.420+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm gonna ask here since it's tangentially related to the above:\n\n>Do not post or engage in discussions of religion, ethnicity/race, sexual orientation, gender, politics, or real-world social issues.\n\nHow about as they pertain to League, or gaming in general?

He just happens to fight with guns, which has nothing to do with his race and everything to do with his character fantasy. The \"heroic anti-supernatural gunslinger\" is a trope from many forms of media, and simply because Lucian is a BLACK anti-supernatural gunslinger doesn't make that racist. Sure, you could MAKE it racist if you leaned into certain stereotypes, but Lucian's character portrayal definitely avoids that.\n\nEkko didn't really steal anything -- he took a crystal from the rubble of a demolished lab, and invented his own device around it. He's an ingenous child turned mage-punk hero, and the fact that he happens to be black doesn't make him a stereotype.\n\nIn effect, people need to realize that a character's skin color is just that -- a skin color. Unless we see enough stereotypical elements to be insulting, it's safe to assume that you're simply reading too far into things. If criminals, gunslingers, mages, and great warriors exist in *League of Legends*, than a person of ANY skin color or ethnicity can be a criminal, gunslinger, mage, or great warrior.\n\n----------------------------------\n\nThis is also entirely different from the use of pejorative language. \"This gunslinging character happens to be black\" is a description of a character that is neither inherently racist nor insulting. \"You're a retarded cuck\" is an insult, plain and simple.","replies":[{"poster":"Godly Archfiend","date":"2018-06-14T14:20:07.938+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You come to what i meant but probably I set it wrong Sry for that English is not my primary language it is how you lean to something so why say <<even if it was intended as humorous>> isn't that for the people to decide?

I feel like it makes no more sense than to list Christian, Muslim, Arab, Turk, Mongol, Chinese, Black, White, Male, Mexican, etc.  In fact, just remove the list altogether and get rid of the rule.  It's too subjective and open-ended.  It puts too much power in mods hands based on their personal interpretations.  There is no clear line to say is something is pejorative or if it exceeds some arbitrary line of how pejorative something is allowed to be.  If someone says they are tired of being bible bashed are they going to be banned for using a pejorative against religion?  If someone says that they don't like blacks being shot by racist cops, are they going to be banned for showing contempt against law enforcement?  What if someone says the opposite, that cops should be empowered to make snap judgments in order to preserve law enforcement lives even if it means accepting civilians deaths that are partly the result of racial profiling, is that being pejorative against blacks because it could be interpreted as saying that cop lives are more important than certain blacks in high-crime areas?  This rule is honestly stupid and meaningless.  All you mods do is shut down free speech.  The only rule I agree with is the one against sharing personal identity information.  You might as well add \"mod\" to your stupid list, because whenever I use that word, I mean it pejoratively with as much contempt as I can fit in a word.","replies":[]},{"poster":"La Belle Sauvage","date":"2018-06-22T15:36:48.028+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Question @ The Djinn:\n\nOften when answering Tech Spec questions I mention JayzTwocent's YouTube Channel.
