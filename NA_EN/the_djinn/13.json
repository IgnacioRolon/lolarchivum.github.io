However, for this particular suggestion I see two major problems:\n\n1) It feeds into the vindictive / retaliatory mindset which are both undesirable traits in a fair and unbiased punishment system. This could be equated to giving a trophy to a citizen who reports a legitimate crime. Do citizens get recognized for reporting crimes? Yes, sometimes. However, that is done to encourage people to participate in communication with law enforcement more so than to make reporting a crime some kind of commodity to be earned. You may see social media posts from your local agencies thanking citizens for participating in the justice process, but you're not going to see those agencies tally numbers for those people.\n\n2) As my last sentence implies, it has the strong ability to turn the system, which _should be_ seen as a \"duty\", into a \"game\" where you earn prestige for participating. There is a lot of potential for abuse here and having to mitigate that abuse (false reports) because people are looking to up their numbers pushes this well beyond a simple \"quality of life\" change. \n\nPunishment systems, at the ideal level, should be impartial and unbiased. We as participants should feel obligated to report bad behavior not because it earns us renown, but because a) the community will benefit from less inappropriate conduct and b) our personal experience will be better because we don't have to deal with undesirables. Will this ever work 100% of the time at 100% effectiveness? No. It has to be as efficient as possible as fairly as possible. The foundation of a system (or a feature of that system, such as this) which rewards some innate desire for personal retribution is, very simply, biased and skewed, period.\n\nIf people want to see proof of a system functioning, then perhaps Riot should release recurring statistics on actions taken overall. Maybe a /dev blog post that can be done at intervals. I feel like I've seen this suggestion before somewhere.

That is a fact. This game's player base is no less toxic now than it was back in the pre-Lyte era. If anything, it's worse. We're told over and over again, by the numbers, how most players don't get punished, and how those that do usually don't get punished again. \n\nFine.. but the problem is that there are multiple ways to read that statistic. The **implication** is that most players clean up their act, go forth, and sin no more after that first 10 game tap on the shoulder.\n\n\n## But that's not what we were told - we were only told the statistic.\n\n\nI'd instead be willing to bet (and take this for the ass-pull that this implies) that after that 10 game tap on the shoulder that most players simply become more subtle about their raging in ways that the IFS is bad about detecting. In the heat of the moment, you might remember that your anger got you punished last time, *but you're still angry*, so you still vent and attack, but you don't do it rashly. The people who act rashly are the ones that wind up here crying about their bans and calling us all SJWs.\n\nI'll say one positive thing about the IFS, and that's that the trigger word detection actually works. I've had maybe, *maybe* two games in my entire history where someone was dropping slurs or 'kys' or something else that leads to an instaban. That message has been received loud and clear. Even if you look at this board, the number of complaints about bans for trigger words seems to have almost completely stopped..\n\nThat said, I've had many, *many* more games with toxicity in them that would be very hard, if not impossible, for a computer to detect. Infuriating passive-aggression towards one's own team (which is almost worse than being called a slur). Intentional feeding in a way that would be indistinguishable from simple error (it doesn't take more than one or two of those to ruin a game for the team).\n\nThese two problems lead me to believe that the DOTA approach (prisoner's island) is actually more fruitful in the long run for making the average player experience suck less. Get the trouble makers out of the queue with civilized people and move on already.\n\nRiot's focus on rehab hangs entirely on this data point that most players stop misbehaving after a single punishment. My experience on the rift (especially in low/mid silver where most of the player base is), and the experience of many others, calls the interpretation of that data point into question","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Eleshakai","date":"2018-10-06T13:37:09.474+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Xhaiden,realm=EUNE,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=2j4NLw62,comment-id=000f,timestamp=2018-10-06T13:20:38.353+0000)\n>\n> And how is this helpful exactly?\n> \n> I mean, you spend around two minutes in queue (or less than a minute if you pick support) - cause there&#x27;s millions of people playing this game.

If you're a toxic person - you get matched with others alike. If you're normal or agreeable, again - you matched with other alike. The system would be auto-mated anyway (just basic math  - where the sum of all 5 votes from each game show where you're standing). And thus, you can't blame Riot anymore - cause it's all to you to get matched with the people you deserve.\n\nThe only people that wouldn't agree with a system like this - are very toxic themselves - and hate the idea of being matched with others alike (looking in the mirror). It's easier to blame others for your failure - than to take responsibility. The things is - there's lots of people who used to be really agreeable at first (behavior wise) - till they kept getting matched with the toxic sided of LoL. And obviously it was just a matter of time till they would brake - and shows signs of toxicity themselves. As the saying goes (idiom) - \"it takes just one rotten apple to spoils the rest\". A system like this is the only viable option - so the majority could find this game more enjoyable.  And that's the opposite of hiding the problem - \"it will bring it out in the open\". As reflected by your status (you'd also get a icon than matches that). So hey if you wanna be toxic - keep on playing with others alike. If not, try to get out.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Xion The XIV","date":"2018-10-06T05:40:47.601+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"I would rather have a nice Tribunal type of thing again.

Maybe get the number of games in which one of your teammates (and maybe enemies) reported you and including in how many of those games you were unsportsmanlike according to the system.

My highest was mid-Gold a few years back but, again, I didn't take it seriously: we're talking under 30 games a season, which isn't enough to be especially accurate.\n\nSo I can't really say. There was a time I could hold my own against Diamond players in normals, but I've definitely gotten rustier and more prone to just chilling in games since then, so I suspect I've lost that ability on all but a select few champions.","replies":[{"poster":"Ahri Carries All","date":"2018-10-11T00:39:46.629+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, if you were interested, you could use your main account and tryhard for 100 games in Solo Queue as a party of 1 for a period of four months (so we'd be talking less than one game a day where you would be tryharding on your main champs in ranked).
