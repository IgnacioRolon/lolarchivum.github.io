The design team knocked most of this out of the park.\n\nhttps://cdn.upcomer.com/esports/__sized__/content/4234-qiyana-crop-c0-5__0-5-780x312.png\n\n...but then we get to her hair. We have what *appears* to be the empress of a region that seems inspired by meso-american culture to at least some extent, and given how different that is from anything else we've seen in Runeterra it feels like a great opportunity to show us that by making a character whose hair and makeup styles reflect that cultural difference. Instead, we have another female character with white, flowing, slightly curled hair and a classical western tiara-style crown.\n\nNow, I have nothing against that, but I feel it's a missed opportunity to tell us something about this new region. Compare to Illaoi, who sells her culture through her unusual earrings, makeup, and hairstyle, causing her face to very clearly reflect her character and her origin.\n\nIf we zoom in on Qiyana, we can basically call her a somewhat generic Runeterra woman. Probably a princess or a queen, sure, but for someone who is introducing a new region and is -- further -- the *leader* of said region, does this really live up to that representation?\n\nhttps://imgur.com/LgWG5mD\n\nCompare that to how unique taking inspiration from, say, any of this traditional Mayan (or African, or Egyptian, we there are some elements of those in the design as well) hairstyles would be -- and there are certainly more cultures you could pull from. She obviously needs a hairstyle that's unique to *her* culture and not a real-world culture, but I feel there's untapped ground here to showcase who she and her people are.\n\nhttps://images-wixmp-ed30a86b8c4ca887773594c2.wixmp.com/f/f80d065e-d050-421a-ad5b-e89bd87af73a/d7v1kth-1579e8d7-97a5-4aa0-8142-744d1be88307.jpg/v1/fill/w_1024,h_3982,q_75,strp/maya_women_hairstyles_of_the_classic_period_by_kamazotz_d7v1kth-fullview.jpg?token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJ1cm46YXBwOjdlMGQxODg5ODIyNjQzNzNhNWYwZDQxNWVhMGQyNmUwIiwiaXNzIjoidXJuOmFwcDo3ZTBkMTg4OTgyMjY0MzczYTVmMGQ0MTVlYTBkMjZlMCIsIm9iaiI6W1t7ImhlaWdodCI6Ijw9Mzk4MiIsInBhdGgiOiJcL2ZcL2Y4MGQwNjVlLWQwNTAtNDIxYS1hZDViLWU4OWJkODdhZjczYVwvZDd2MWt0aC0xNTc5ZThkNy05N2E1LTRhYTAtODE0Mi03NDRkMWJlODgzMDcuanBnIiwid2lkdGgiOiI8PTEwMjQifV1dLCJhdWQiOlsidXJuOnNlcnZpY2U6aW1hZ2Uub3BlcmF0aW9ucyJdfQ.tX-M51hNubSa3kfF1a8CdmwQL56cn2bTz6Cujdz9NFU","replies":[{"poster":"Oleandervine","date":"2019-06-06T19:35:28.419+0000","up_votes":93,"down_votes":3,"body":"I also felt like her hair really missed the mark.

That isn't to say Illaoi is unattractive, but she's a tall, beefy, powerful woman that went far and away thematically from the Syndras and Jannas of Runeterra.

That being said, I don't think Riot NEEDS every character to be popular these days. A lot of people have played this game for years and are set in their mains, it's much more likely to make me budge off Lux if there is a niche character I really identify with over another wide-appealing character that has me saying not much more than \"oh look, a new champion\".","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jennniii","date":"2019-06-06T21:34:38.998+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{sticker:sg-jinx}} gimme this champ now","replies":[]},{"poster":"Frontline Fury","date":"2019-06-07T08:38:40.184+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"The hair and face just ruins the whole character to me.

Although that would explain why Yuumi is still a champion concept more than a complete champion, the work could've been sped up (don't know if it's correct) in order to hop on the next champion before the job on Yuumi was even finished. Hell, she's a support but the most efficient way I've found to play her is as a crit ADC with Hail of blades","replies":[]}]}]}
