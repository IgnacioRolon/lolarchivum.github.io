[Lore + Science Question]","subforum":"Story, Art, & Sound","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey guys!\n\nA recent video posted in C&amp;C -- [link for those curious](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CwKxmABDUI) -- made me dive into some analysis to check the data, and I found some interesting stuff that made me really want to know more about Galio. Specifically, either his lore, art, or petricite's density seem off, and I wanted to find out what's up.\n\nWe know Petricite is made of limestone (density 110-160 pounds per cubic foot), ash, and some other materials. Common construction techniques for similar materials involved about an 80-90% ratio of the stone to about a 10-20% ratio of other materials, so we&#039;re looking at likely 100-150 pounds.\n\nGiven Galio&#039;s height (which I found to be about 95 feet) and proportions (which seem to be about 30-40% more volume than a human of comparable height), I personally calculated his volume at MINIMUM to be around 11,000 cubic feet (assuming human proportions), and more likely around 15,700 cubit feet. That would put his weight in the realm of between 550 tons (human proportions) and 780 tons (rough Galio proportion estimate).\n\nSo far so good.\n\n-----------------\n\n#BUT GALIO CLAIMS HE WEIGHS ONLY 300 TONS IN HIS QUOTES\n\n-------------------\n\nWhat&#039;s the deal here, Riot? Is Galio simply really inaccurate with his measurements? Is the splash art scaling off by a factor of nearly double in Galio&#039;s overall volume? Is petricite magically significantly less dense than its composition would entail? Or is Galio constructed more like the Statue of Liberty, and partly hollow?\n\n[](https://lolstatic-a.akamaihd.net/frontpage/apps/prod/rg-galio-update-2017/en_US/f554ef373e0e733bbe72addb2603447d72a4fec4/assets/img/galio_1200x630.jpg)","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2017-07-16T20:17:19.688+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your first mistake is assuming that Runeterra has the same gravitational pull that Earth does...\n\n.\n\n.\n\nI kid!

Maybe slightly lower on Runeterra since some characters can jump fairly high?\n\n> I kid!

But to be off by a factor of at LEAST 40% and more likely 60-80% is a bit odd. That's like me claiming I weigh about 70 pounds as a 6'2\" man. :P","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2017-07-17T01:11:05.743+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly, if it's no one singular explanation, but a combination of all those that have been evoked in this thread, a 50% difference is not so surprising.\n\n* It could be hollow near joints.\n* Perspective could throw the scales off by a little bit.\n* Maybe the magic is causing some strange atomic rearrangement that slightly changes the density of the material.\n* Maybe Runeterra gravity is slightly lower, something like 10 or 20% that would make it not really noticeable but still enough to impact weight measurements.\n* Gallio doesn't seem really educated and could make a lot of errors in his measurements.\n\nEven if no factor accounts for more that 10-15%, if you combine them all, you could get something that fit with your numbers.\n\n...\n...\n\n\nBut honestly, I assume that Gallio is just saying a big number that sounds cool, with no care for what the reality actually is. That sounds so much Gallio.","replies":[]}]}
