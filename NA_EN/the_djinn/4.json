He feels like a front-line brawler, but his damage is so low that he barely threatens the front line. As such, he ends up as an easily kite-able character who, though he seems like a front-line fighter, wants to actually run past into the back line.\n\nThe goal of this rework is to re-position Garen at the front of the fight as a tanky bruiser who can take on tanks on their own terms. A secondary goal is to preserve the simplicity of Garen&#039;s kit, as he is designed to be a beginner-friendly champion.\n\n**As always, thoughts and comments are appreciated:** more important, however, is actionable input. Tell me what you like, what you don&#039;t like. All concepts are works in progress, and your input is valued.\n\n****\n##PASSIVE &ndash;  PERSEVERANCE\nNo Change\n>This update aims to be as low-scope as possible, and Perseverance  in its current form still functions just fine for this kit.\n\n****\n##Q &ndash; DECISIVE STRIKE\nGaren breaks free from all&nbsp;&nbsp;***slows***&nbsp;affecting him and gains **35%** movement speed for a few seconds. Additionally, his next basic attack within 4.5&nbsp;seconds will deal additional physical damage equal to **8 / 9 / 10 / 11 / 12%** of the target&#039;s maximum health and will&nbsp;&nbsp;***silence***&nbsp;his target for **1.5 / 1.75 / 2 / 2.25 / 2.5** seconds.\n\n**Cooldown:** 8 seconds. \n>The shift to % maximum health damage helps Garen in his new shift to the front lines by making him significantly more target-agnostic with his damage. High health targets will end up taking a considerable amount of damage, while lower health targets will only take slightly more damage than on live.\n\n****\n##W &ndash;  COURAGE\nNo Change\n>This update aims to be as low-scope as possible, and Courage in its current form still functions just fine for this kit.\n\n****\n##E &ndash;  Judgement\nGaren rapidly spins his sword around his body for **3** seconds, dealing **10 / 20 / 30 / 40 / 50 (+70 / 80 / 90 / 100 / 110% AD)** physical damage every **.5** seconds to enemies within range. Garen ignores unit collision while spinning, but moves **20%** slower when traveling through minions. \n\nEnemies damaged by Judgement lose **2% **of their ***bonus armor*** each time they take damage. This increases by **2%** for each additional instance of damage they take, to a maximum of **42%** reduced ***bonus armor*** after a full **3** seconds inside Judgement. This debuff lasts for 5 second.\n\n**Range:** 300 unit area around Garen.\n**Cooldown:** 14 / 13 / 12 / 11 / 10 seconds (+1 second from live).\n>Judgement&#039;s old design dealt damage, but it didn&#039;t make Garen a front-line threat. Now teams are actually strongly penalized for standing inside Garen&#039;s spin, encouraging him to tear into the front line to break it apart. It&#039;s also much more penalizing for larger armor values, meaning Garen is no longer as encouraged to run into the back line and spin down the squishy champions. \n\n>The damage numbers have been lowered slightly and the cooldown raised to prevent Garen's new Q + E from making him too much of a lane bully. His shred is bonus armor based to make it more threatening to tanks, but also to prevent it from overpowering the early game. Finally, due to the slightly lower damage values (20 damage per second at max ranks), minions no longer take reduced damage from the effect.\n\n****\n##R &ndash;  DEMACIAN JUSTICE\n~~Garen calls upon the might of Demacia to strike an enemy champion, dealing **150 / 250 / 350 (+15 / 20 / 25% of target&#039;s maximum health)** magic damage. The impact leaves a large sigil on the ground for 8 seconds (approximately a 475 radius &ndash; the size of Maokai&#039;s ultimate). Allies standing within the sigil gain **15 / 25 / 30%** ***tenacity.***~~\n\n##UPDATE: R &ndash;  DEMACIAN JUSTICE\nGaren calls upon the might of Demacia to attempt to execute an enemy champion, dealing **150 / 300 / 450 (+26 / 33 / 40% of the target's missing health)** magic damage. If Demacian Justice kills the target, Garen and nearby allies are **Inspired** for 5 seconds, gaining **20%** movement speed and **armor** and **magic resistance** equal to **30%** of the target's **armor** and **magic resistance**.\n\n**Range:** 400 units.\n**Cooldown: ** 120 / 110 / 80 seconds.\n>The new update keeps the execute flavor of old Garen, while giving him some serious incentive to use it on a durable opponent if the opportunity presents itself. It loses a little bit of damage but gains a massive amount of utility if used on the right target at the right time.\n\n\n#A NOTE ABOUT THE POLL\nIf you like or dislike the concept (specifically if you select \"Doesn't even feel like Garen\"), please let me know **WHY**. That, more than anything else, will help me iterate and improve my designs, both for this project and any in the future.","replies":[{"poster":"qetzel","date":"2015-05-05T20:06:48.707+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That much maximum health damage on one kit?

We should keep it that way.\n\nI intentionally changed it to maximum health so you *could* use it to execute someone if you wanted. Definitely could push it back to an execute, but I think that pulls Garen back into the \"dive past the front line\" thing. Is that were we *want* him to be?\n\nAlternatively, the AoE could be put into his W, I suspect. I think there's a little wiggle room in Garen's power budget, and E-ing the tank line apart while providing some tenacity to your buddies before heading to Q + R the squishy might be more dynamic than his current play pattern.

Mind if I play around with that for a bit?\n\n**Edit:** I also like that it adds to Garen's skilled play cap by adding to his team's coordination. If you can focus down the tank and get Garen to burst them into the ground, you guys, as a **team**, will come out ahead. But Garen's unlikely to be able to burst the tank down alone. So it's E + team burst + R onto the tank, which gives Garen a higher optimal play pattern without making his kit much more complex.","replies":[{"poster":"420Templar","date":"2015-05-05T20:58:36.364+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=The Djinn,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=BscZpgmY,comment-id=000100000000000000000000,timestamp=2015-05-05T20:58:05.759+0000)\n>\n> Ooh. **THAT** I quite like, at least conceptually.

The decision is WHICH one to use it on, and WHEN, so you get the most benefit for the fight.\n\n**I do see your point though.** It's a slightly tricky issue to solve, as I'd really like to give Garen a bit more to do than simply remove someone from the battlefield.\n\n> The problem with Garen is that he is definitely the best champion for new players.

It's part of why his E is structured the way it is: it rewards you for managing to--through positioning and proper Q use and proper targeting--keep your opponents in your E. But finding other places to add skill to Garen without making him too complicated is quite difficult.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Fertsa","date":"2015-05-05T20:01:38.196+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd prefer if garen, along with every other tank in league, Would deal a decent amount less damage and be less mobile than the invincible speedy powerhouses they currently are.","replies":[{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2015-05-05T20:02:42.623+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Fertsa,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=BscZpgmY,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-05-05T20:01:38.196+0000)\n>\n> I'd prefer if garen, along with every other tank in league, Would deal a decent amount less damage and be less mobile than the invincible speedy powerhouses they currently are.\n\nGaren's already a pretty low damage tank, *and* a very immobile tank.
