This critique is not a tear-down, but rather the places where I think the design struggles.\n\n**USER INTERFACE**\nThe UI looks solid across the board and works in most cases (items stacking up can be a bit weird sometimes), but there is some major room for improvement.\n\n* During the Carousal you cannot see your team or your items, making this a needless memory test.\n* During the Carousal you cannot left-click on units to see their stats, making this a needless memory test.\n* During the Carousal you do not see a countdown to your own movement, making this frustrating. Additionally, your unit repeatedly moving upon wall collision and lacking a very clear highlight indicator makes this (and navigation) worse.\n* You cannot bring up a list of items, making this a needless memory test.\n* You cannot see an item's build paths anywhere, meaning that you often have to *equip an item you don't actually want to equip* just to see how you can combine it with other items -- or have another needless memory test.\n* You cannot see enemy synergies, making this a memory test. If my opponent has the Assassin and Ninja bonuses active I should be able to see that, especially as some larger units and health bars can obscure the back lines of units.\n\n**GAMEPLAY**\nI'm going to avoid discussing specific unit balance here, because that's highly subject to change.\n\n* Champions come from a shared pool (or so I've been told), but this mechanic is not clearly conveyed ANYWHERE in-game. This is hugely problematic, as this is a mechanic that cannot be easily understood from playing the game, and leads to frustration with rerolls.\n* It's a bit unfortunate that every Role/Origin has breakpoints rather than growth. I think the mandatory breakpoints serve to make RNG more punishing and builds more locked in, while opening up a few of those might increase flexibility. For example: if Rangers or Assassins or anything with a +3/+6 bonus gave you scaling between those breakpoints, it wouldn't end up as punishing to not manage to roll that Legendary Kayle. ***Example:*** If we picked Yordles as an example, it might start at 20% at 3 (again, some brekapoints are good, and having minimum buy-in feels appropriate), and then go 20/25/30/50. What that does is still STRONGLY encourage that breakpoint, but give you some mitigating tools if you're going for it and can't quite hit the breakpoint due to RNG.\n* It's extremely frustrating the extent to which units are RNG. Given that items already are and that gold is used to increase your team size as well, the fact that luck is the difference between a Level 3 champion at by the second Player vs. Player fight or rerolling 30 times and *still* not getting that Darius you need is extremely unforgiving.\n* The inability to see who your opponent will be means that a level of reactionary strategy is effectively removed from the game, which puts the game further into RNG territory.\n* The RNG of items is severely problematic given their impact, especially early on. I've seen games where by the first Player vs. Player fight someone had 3 completed items and a level 2 Vayne (with Vayne-appropriate items) up against someone who -- through no fault of their own -- has just their starting item and mediocre champions.\n* It's frustrating that the exact same match (with the same units in the same position and with the same items) can turn out *differently* due to RNG mechanics. *This makes it hard to tell how (or even if) you should re-position your team after any given fight, and that means that the perceivable impact of good build placement is significantly lessened*. In fact, the inability to really predict how your units will move raises an even bigger problem: *It is almost impossible to accurately strategize for your team's movement once the fight begins, which hurts the core concept of the game as one of strategic team construction*. Of course, I understand that this is kind of a common element in the genre, but I'd like to see in-fight RNG lessened a bit so that I more often feel like my own choices had a greater impact on my victory.\n\nOtherwise, combat is generally decent. It's fun to watch and gets very tense at times, and comebacks can be thrilling. While it's very frustrating to not really be able to pinpoint how you could have adjusted your team to win a fight that you lost (or sometimes to not know why you lost a fight as badly as you did), it still gets points for being visually appealing.\n\nReally, though, there's something of a dealbreaker here: **It is often impossible to look at a fight and know what you could have / should have done, and often a fight is just lost no matter what you do.** Neither of those is great in a game intending to have ranked.\n\n----------------------------------------------\n\nI think if ***Teamfight Tactics*** is going to find its legs as a competitive game, it needs to tone down the RNG slightly so that strategies can be more proactive. Having RNG in champions, carousal availability, items received, frequency of items received, opponents (at least unpredictable although not entirely random), *and* fight mechanics means that of the six main mechanics ***all six*** have moderate to severe RNG elements. It would be potentially valuable to see some of these mitigated (just a few -- RNG is definitely a part of this style of game, and shouldn't be removed or *overly* mitigated in too many of those mechanics), such as being able to see carousal availability in advance, getting to see the next Champion offering you'll get, being able to pick one of three of four items at breakpoints in the game (with reduced random items), the ability to over-pay to acquire a SPECIFIC champion, or similar. I think exploring mechanics like these could help bring the RNG elements of TFT in line to make it a bit more of a game of strategy and unit placement and a bit less like a game that feels like it's sometimes playing you.","replies":[{"poster":"goodiesohhi","date":"2019-06-28T03:33:22.028+0000","up_votes":41,"down_votes":3,"body":"I think the biggest problem is item rng.

Unit \"RNG\" is a staple of these games wich means you can't go into a game with a strategy in mind, you must adapt to what the shared global shop pool gives you. That being said TFT doesn't have any iirc, 9 unit synergies and where \"other\" games have most synergyes at breakpoints of 3, alot more here at at 2s (knights, gunslingers, rangers, wild) wich mean gives you alot of wiggle room to play with what is in the shop and not end up with an inferior build. I love this\n\nIn underlords there basically 3, meta comps right now, Mages, Hunters and Knights , these being tier S with Demons and Warriors and Druids argueably stitting at t1. Trying to build anything else will probably get you stomped by anyone playing meta even by accident. The thing is in underlords i feel i can build my comp as late as even round 15 and the sheer strenght of the bonuses (and the lack of item snowball) will carry me even if my line-up is underleveled. This is a good and bad thing. Overall i think i prefer TFT in this regard as you trully MUST adapt on the spot and not go in with an idea of \"ok i'll go for 1 of the tier S comps and if X happens in a pinch i can stick with a Tier A comp\". Some comps are better than others clearly, and you should know when you can go for them though. This is a plus on how the alliances and units are balanced against each other in a vacuum in TFT , you can win with \"anything\" as long as you play for economy and just outlevel your opponent ... hell i won with Pirate Gunslinger Assasins Imperial Knights yday AND i turned my Draven into my 3rd assasin by the end. Even had a lvl 2 MF.\n\nHOWEVER\n\n1) Item rng flushes this all down the toilet and throws dynamite at it. While in terms of composition i can slap my hands stop being so greedy, not reroll and realize that comp i was being pulled into early isn't going to pan out and i should probably switch.... no amount of building and planning will stand up to the massive thunder cock of a triple item vayne... or darius ... or sol. Item NUMBER variance should not be a thing. Unit greed is mitigateable and in fact a component of playing autochess games. Knowing when to slap your hand off the reroll button and to play for eco, knowing when your line-up is \"good enough\" and you can float 30-40g to edge out a few upgrades, is a skill. People getting 5 items on round 4 is soooooo bad. It seems to be a point that's being hammered atm but here's my voice NORMALIZE ITEM DROPS FFS! At LEAST on the first 3 rounds, at least! Ti prego!\n\n~~2)~~ And maybe this should be 1) but i feel item snowballing really tosses any \"tactics\" out the window. Ow and for the love of all that is fluffy don't do what Blizzard did to legendary items in Legion. Having a specific legendary over a different one was a pretty big boost in power , like 15% more damage for having one Legendary instead of another one, so instead of boosting droprate or making the legendary's elective so people could get the ones that want instead of random ones, they just \"normalized\" - heavily nerfed - the good ones so everyone was \"equal\" ---- equally boring. The items should be powerfull and exicting. See point about unit balance. It shouldn't matter if you get a Rageblade and your opponent gets a Zephyr.\n\n/rant sigh\n\n2) The UI is ...... erm \"clearly rushed\". Let's just put it that way. In short i tryed to get a friend to play the game yday a friend with hundreds of hours play in Auto-chess and Underlords. \"Dude the opponents arn't beating me, this UI is\" \"So this is my first and last game of this \"lovely\" game , at least untill they fix this UI\". And i aggre with him. I have patience for tediosness when i want something (and i really WANT to love this game) to rival the man in the iron mask but for god's sake how did you guys think this was OK?!\n\nUnits in the shop don't glow when they're an upgrade (considering i havn't seen people whine about this maybe i'm not noticing something?)\n\nLeft panel only shows what you have on the board. It does not show if there's is something in the bench that would add to your comp, it does not show if there's something in the SHOP that would add to the comp\n\nColour code Class / Origin icons please\n\nNo indication of what the enemy is playing\n\nNo indication of a units stats or class during the carousell\n\nNo indication of when my minion is going to be released from the carousell\n\nNo indication of what items combine into untill they're allready on a champion (god bless the 2nd monitor)\n\nNo Shortcut Key to lock the shop (really?).\n\nNo big indication that it is a new round, this is a niggle but honestly i've had many many instances of just sitting there and it took a good 5-10 seconds to realize \"ow! it's a new round! i have gold and new units\".

There isn't really a half value for it and in a lot of cases offering a bonus for a solo synergy can risk being too powerful especially if it can upgrade.  Solo synergies in Auto Chess games are meant to be rare so they're more impactful, League has 3 currently so as is its pretty fine.  \n\nAlso I don't know how this could even work with more traditional effects like Yordles, Sorcerers, or Assassins.  Yordles is 20% at 3, 50% at 6.  Are you suggesting it go 5/10/20 or something even like 6/12/20?

I know you'll have rounds where the global 5% crit makes a difference, I've had assassin comps where my Kha'Zix with IE instantly crits someone and that entirely decided a fight.  But when it comes to the question of where to position, it really has less to do with crits or dodges and more about watching where units move at the start of combat.\n\nThe issue is when items like Zeke's and Locket exist and a synergy like Guardian exists, you're forced to position in a clump to be optimal.  You have 21 spaces to work with vs the 36 in DAC.  In that game you can play around with positioning more in order to have assassin bait on your backline while letting your ranged carries be slightly back, or you can position in formations to counter mages and carries in more dynamic ways.  As is in TFT, it feels like your only positioning choice is left, right, or center.  You completely lose the vertical dimension that allows for dynamic positioning the way the current map is set up.  And honestly losing this part of the strategy feels really bad, the only 3 parts of the strategy are unit choice, item choice, and positioning.","replies":[{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2019-06-28T12:15:57.716+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=TwitchInMyPants,realm=NA,application-id=RaE1aOE7,discussion-id=OxtEwEVh,comment-id=000b,timestamp=2019-06-28T12:04:53.226+0000)Just saying, things like Pirates, Phantom, Dragons, Elementalists or Blademasters wouldn't be able to work like this given their unique effects. \n\nHence why I specified 3/6, rather than *everything*.

Find other ways to use Yordle other then just themselves.
