These are the challenge lines, \"Scream \"Demacia,\" Garen. Scream its name before I crush you. And it.\"  You'll here one of these lines, once for each member of the enemy team.  Now because of the way the game works and the audio system works you have about a 80% chance of getting a \"First_Encounter\"  line against your top lane opponent-- but a much lower chance against other champions (less than 50% in testing).   But this is over 50 lines in the script-- so listening to these lines out of context gives you a false view of the champion's personality and tone.   (Hearing them back to back makes him seem sassy and arrogant)    --Why is this type of line valuable and why are many of these comedic?  Because this type of line is geared to go off in that brief moment around the first minion's wave's arrival--  it helps get the player in the mood for the fight, amuses, and reminds you Aatrox loves to duel.     \n\nSimilarly Aatrox also has \"Long_Move_Lines\" but these only trigger when Aatrox is leaving the base and has clicked a very long distance. (Heading back to a lane or jungle).  These lines are \"preparatory\" and longer.  Because we can guess that the player is heading back to a fight-- So often these lines are more emotional, internal, revealing, and speak to why the character is fighting.   \n\nThese contrast \"Attack_Lines\" which are short and violent because we know you are attacking an enemy champion.  (You clicked on an enemy champ)\n\nIn Aatrox's case the variance between these different elements is larger than normal-- in part because he actually has very long cool downs and because he has many new triggers that are set up to occur at different parts of the game.  (This tech is still WIP so --it's not quite working in PBE)  \n\nSo for example not only are Aatrox's attack lines are more violent and shorter than his move lines... his late game Attack lines and Move lines are much shorter and more violent than his early game Attack and Move lines.","replies":[{"poster":"World Ender","date":"2018-06-14T19:09:54.562+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really appreciate this. I've played Aatrox for about 3 years and the big thing that got me into him was his thematic and personality. I feel like your writing combined with the huge range of emotion that the VA performed really captures the essence of who Aatrox is as a champion and I couldn't be happier with the end result. His serious lines have such emotion, and I'm not lying when I say they even got me a bit emotional. To finally see the champion that I've loved for the greater part of my league experience fulfilled so perfectly is incredible. I cannot wait for his lore now!","replies":[{"poster":"WAAARGHbobo","date":"2018-06-14T19:39:42.453+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"Thank you so much.    \n\nI realize a lot of people don't see it that way-- but I spent a looong time looking at who Aatrox was and trying to craft a personality (thru lines and maths) that captures --not who he was, (because the kit and gameplay role has changed) but who players might want him to be and feel like now.  \n\nthanx","replies":[{"poster":"Old Man Riven","date":"2018-06-15T01:34:10.273+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=WAAARGHbobo,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=iErwH2Fp,comment-id=000700000000,timestamp=2018-06-14T19:39:42.453+0000)\n>\n> Thank you so much.    \n> \n> I realize a lot of people don&#x27;t see it that way-- but I spent a looong time looking at who Aatrox was and trying to craft a personality (thru lines and maths) that captures --not who he was, (because the kit and gameplay role has changed) but who players might want him to be and feel like now.  \n> \n> thanx\n\nI think most of the complaints would be resolved by simply pruning some of the quotes.\n\nTake this one for example.\n\n\"Do I resemble you, abomination? Your form isn't my destiny... is it? You don't know how to talk, do you? Shit...\"\n\nI was so taken by this line, until it got to \"You don't know how to talk..\" then I was sad, and then he said \"Shit.\" and I was disappointed.\n\nWhy add this kind of stuff? He has plenty of jokey lines, and not nearly enough powerful ones like that.  \n\nSame with this one - \"I will find a way to tear down the heavens and reveal you as fiends! Not today obviously...\"\n\nWhy add the last bit? The line is fine without that, and it just adds yet more unnecessary humor to him.\n\nLike, Pyke I get it - he's a harpooner, lower-class sailor from Bilgewater; he would have a bit of gallows humor and is still human, despite his very different state post-Jaull fish.  Aatrox isn't though.  \n\nI'm not going to nit-pick every line, but those two just struck me as great examples of powerful lines that are marred by the last bits of \"humor\" in them.  Further, why doesn't he have ANY lines for his fellow Darkin that are indicative of some kind of camaraderie with the others? Rhaast has one for each of his fellows, and he's supposed to be the maniac of the bunch.\n\nI will admit that I had this built-up very high because you did such phenomenal work on Kled and Jhin - both of whom are sort of extreme ends of what sort of personality you've given Aatrox, where Kled is absurd and Jhin is very, very dark.  But both of them are wonderfully-written.  So maybe I sort of hyped it up to the point where you couldn't possibly deliver, but I suppose Aatrox is special to me, and I did not expect some of the things he says. Like, why does he so often declare that he's a god killer or a world ender? Shouldn't he not really need to say those things.  \n\nAt any rate, I do think he has some extremely good lines, quite a few, but I think he sort of ended up in a place that makes him feel quite a bit unlike Reav3 described him, which was \"very different from Rhaast and Varus\" where I feel he overlaps with Rhaast too much, but Rhaast does a better job. \n\nI am also not so sure his gameplay role has really changed enough that it's usable as a justification for a pretty big personality swing.  His role didn't really change - he's still a fighter who wants to kill the backline, whether he dives in or fights whomever gets in his face, he just does it by hitting Q a bunch instead of right clicking.\n\nI realize this sounds pretty negative, it's not - my overall impression is positive, and I think his lines are overall good, he has some I dislike, but that's always a chance. I really do credit some of it to how much I love every single line of Jhin, and wanted Aatrox to be the same way.\nHonorable mention to the lines where he absolutely roasts Jag.","replies":[{"poster":"√Åion","date":"2018-06-15T19:37:33.427+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I try not to get involved in discussions like this for various reasons, mostly the futility of it all, but I can't restrain myself in this instance. Where do people like you get off? Presenting your personal views and opinions as some objective measure of quality? The additives at the end of the lines you highlighted do nothing but elevate the entirety of the quotes for me, personally. They give you so much more insight into who Aatrox is, make them seem much more personal. \n\nLike, Aatrox is the type of guy to tell his opponent he's going to crush the gods whose power you share, but oh, don't worry, he's going to crush you first. It's silly, quirky- maybe even respectful. He's confident enough to think about future events but cares enough about your existence to prioritize. Adding \"Shit\" at the end of the line can be interpreted in so many ways. Somber resignation? Legitimate concern? It's so much more than simple humor, but you just dismiss them as \"JOKING AROUND RUINS MUH EMERSION\", confining everything about the character to your own personal image of him whilst rejecting everything that doesn't conform to said image. \n\nLike, some of the things you go on about you go on about you're just blatantly wrong on. Aatrox isn't human? Perhaps he can't be defined as such anymore, but his short bio on the PBE highly suggest he once was at some point however many moons ago, much like the ascended. And the way you simplify characters so vaguely down to one element is absurd. It's a laughable argument. Jhin is so much more than dark. He can be arrogant, sassy, passionate and psychotic all at the same time. One of his taunts literally has him laughing at his own cheesy joke like a dork. Kled VO expresses so much more than his insanity; his bond with Skaarl, his passion for his own crazy idea of Noxus, his general disdain for people encroaching upon his land, and his land is wherever he says it is. I could go on, because really, there's so much to say about the amazing work Riot does to bring their characters to life within such limited space, but it seems like, left up to you, Aatrox would just be \"Serious Destruction Demon\".\n\nFinally, his gameplay didn't change significantly enough? Honestly, what are you saying? We went from a diver to a straight up juggernaut who wants to (and really only can) mow down everything in his path. You think two extremely short range dashes on long CDs and out of combat move speed makes him a diver? Any champion with moderate CC could keep this guy off your ADC near indefinitely.\n\nLook, I'm not trying to crucify you. You're \"arguments\" just pissed me off so I was more abrasive than usual. We're all entitled to our opinions, we all have things we like and dislike, but just because you dislike an element of the character doesn't make it bad. Light and Dark, nothing is objectively good or bad, one man's garbage is another man's treasure and all that jazz.","replies":[{"poster":"Old Man Riven","date":"2018-06-15T20:30:36.605+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Buddy, to begin with, you need to chill the fuck out.  Criticism is part of this work. \n\nAatrox had a fanbase built around his existing personality, and unlike many of the earlier reworked champions, he actually had one, so this isn't a case where he was a champion with ten lines and no personality who needed something wholly new.\n\nAlso, you don't seem to have even read most of it, but you're being laughably dull - where do I \"get off\" offering the writer feedback? I don't know, maybe as a consumer of the content he writes? Lastly, you couldn't have \"crucified\" me if you tried.\n\nIf you'd even listened to his lines, you'd probably know even HE doesn't see himself as remotely human. He literally refers to himself as a god who is now a prisoner, and laments how far he's fallen.\n\nAs for Jhin, while all of his lines aren't \"this would be easier if blood came in more colors\" he never strays as far from his very well-done personality as Aatrox does. Jhin always keeps a similar tone, you know with every line that he's a killer who sees himself as an artist, and while he's certainly not insane, he is probably a bit of a lunatic when he gets carried away.\n\nSame with Kled.  Kled doesn't try to fool you; he is flatly absurd with every word that comes out of his mouth, and even when he says something surprisingly cogent and \"normal\" to you, he ends up adding something that reminds you that he really is out there. You are apparently conflating the things these characters talk about and the way with which they approach them.  Kled can have all of these ideas and relate them to you, and still maintain the same personality.\n\nAatrox does not do this, Aatrox was said to be \"markedly different from Rhaast\" and sometimes he is, but much of the time, he isn't. Rhaast was cleverly written - he is the bloodthirsty maniac of the Darkin where Varus is the one whose only goal is vengeance. Rhaast just wants to kill people - most of his lines lead up to this with Kayn, and when he takes over, he only gets more violent. His subtle remarks and banter, urging, hints, and other lines for Kayn all stay under the surface, but when he emerges, he reveals himself in full - all of his lines then are very violent, talking about the various destructive forces he wants to unleash and the results of all the killing he's going to do.\n\nAatrox therefore, as a \"markedly different\" personality, would presumably not spend much of his time doing what Rhaast does - declaring how much he's going to kill and screaming in my ear about it.  Rhaast also has humorous lines, but Rhaast is a maniac, so you expect some amount of that from him. Aatrox injects what is supposed to be humor into a significant portion of his lines, and some of them are just dull and very much \"hello fellow kids\" like the \"Shit.\" line.  \n\nAlso, Aatrox decidedly was NOT ever human.  Unless you're suggesting that Aatrox's four sentence bio retcons Rhaast and Varus' entire backstories, both of which aren't even a year old? Very obvious the Darkin came here from somewhere else, and with Aatrox, we now know why - to combat the Void.\n\nFinally, if you're going to put forth that I was making \"poor arguments\" you should probably not do it via logical fallacy, as that's not really a counter-argument.  I never once mentioned \"immersion\" (that's spelled with an \"i\" by the way) - my entire point was that while I overall think Odin did a good job, there is a lot of complaint that he simply injected too much humor into Aatrox's lines.  You realize you don't have to have every champion be funny? Aatrox is supposedly a godlike being who came to this world to save it from something, defended it valiantly, then because of something he and his kind did, were forcibly imprisoned.  Someone like that would understandably be angry, sorrowful, frustrated, and aggressive.  That's fine - but he's also got a whole lot of less than inspired humor.  Canned jokes are fine if there are a few, Rhaast makes a Pulp Fiction joke, after all.  But at least his jokes feel more in-line with the game.  \"Zed's final lesson? Don't be him.\" that's a funny line, and it's a good one - it plays off of Kayn and Zed's relationship, and how despite his enormous reverence for Zed, Kayn really did surpass him and truly wanted this outcome.\n\nMight want to try reading the whole thing though.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"WarWork","date":"2018-06-14T19:56:10.746+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really agree with that a lot actually.

Is to reveal a lore connection.   Jhin and Zed, Aatrox and Zoe, etc...  And depending on the character this can create a lot of interactions or very few.  (depending on how many champions they have lore with).\n\n2. Is a probable lane opponent.   This type of line is less likely to be directly tied to the game lore-- but is there for the player's amusement against someone they will see often.\n\n Depending on the writer, champion, and current LoL leadership the value of interactions is debated and then the value of option 1 vs option 2 is often hotly debated-- But that debate is also dependent on the type of interaction.  \n\n So for instance \"Taunts\" aren't used by player's very often. (esp now that mastery flashing exists)  So the need for this type of line is less. --and probably has even less value for 2.   However First_Encounter lines are more likely to trigger than Taunts (though only once per game).
