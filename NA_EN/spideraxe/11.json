An ult should feel strong).\n\nHis problems in high elo/competitive are the Q/W/E combos. If you do them right you can either trigger your shield and MS over and over and be hard to catch/kill without hard CC or you can deal insane amounts of AOE dmg.\n\nin the end his Q just does too much dmg and his Shield/MS has no CD while being really, really strong. Nerfing the Q dmg and the MS are good steps.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TheHurricaneGamr","date":"2016-12-08T02:38:25.972+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Why not make him more accessible for the lower elos as well while you guys are going through with his balance changes?","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2016-12-08T06:00:10.060+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I expect we'll do some of that too.

Giving it a CD would remove that option for high elo players but change nothing for most lower ones.\n\nAnother thing is the effective E -> E -> Q combo for AOE dmg/deleting the backline. Reduce the dmg on the bounce (can stay the same vs minions if needed) and just do full dmg to the main target. This combo doesn't get used too well in lower elos but is one of his main strengths in high elo. He can nearly kill your ADC without being really in range and on top of that he does hit a lot of enemies. You can never grp too close.\n\nThe last problem is his pretty decent early game for being so strong later in the game. Higher CD on early E ranks (3 sec at rank 1) or lower Q base dmg and a bit better scaling.","replies":[]},{"poster":"XxxLumberJackxxX","date":"2016-12-26T03:27:14.206+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ryzes 9th rework confirmed","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sun Wu Ryuumoku","date":"2016-12-08T16:01:44.694+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"more accessible ? he's already. a cc target... really he's simple enough","replies":[]},{"poster":"Theorex","date":"2016-12-08T15:42:57.716+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Honestly; this is coming from a player who picked new ryze up right away.  \n\nThis is how I see things currently being done at riot.  You are nerfing things that do not need to be nerf at the moment.  When you finally nerf the thing that makes the champion really overpowered, they are under the power curb for where they should be.\n\nI completely agree that he has a very high skill difference just from experienced and inexperienced.  Then Elo gap as well.\n\n\nI personally think that if you are planning on nerfing Ryze.  Start with what makes him strong first.   His E.   \n\nAt higher tiers of play this will be a very strong nerf where they can capitalize on everything.   \n\nAt lower tiers of play most players will not even notice this change.  \n\nInstead of his E being 20%/40%/60%/80%/100% of Q damage increase.  It should be something like 10%/25%/50%/80%/100%  scale down how strong his early game wave clear and damage is.  That makes him less of a lane bully.   \n\nNerfing his Q movement speed IMO is a bandaid, start with a massive nerf.  Instead of these small ones, and then work it up to where you like him at instead.   \n\n\nI miss the old riot where you would completely GUT a champion for three to four patches.  Then come back after you have solid numbers and everything in comparison to the stronger one, then gave them appropriate buffs.       Right now you are just slowly taking power away.\n\n\nWhat I liked about Riot back when they would gut champions that were just simply too strong was. \n\n1: I changed meta ALL the time.\n2:  That meant that it would give you a better picture of what you need to buff after a massive nerf, instead of you having to do guess work to figure out what the next nerf should be. \n3: It gave birth to \"xxxxx too strong?  Better nerf Irelia\"   Ryze too strong?  Better Nerf Irelia.\n\n\nCurrently everyone is sick of seeing the same champions getting played all the time, sure some people love it.  Such as me, I love getting to play Ryze because he is overpowered.  I won't even lie.  His damage is simply insane.   But because you will take too long to gut him into uselessness, I will most likely get away with playing Ryze until about Diamond 1 or 2 level.\n\nThen I will move over to the next strongest champion, Cass.  \n\n\nBut seriously; Riot please take what I am saying into consideration.  I dislike seeing the same champions get played all the time.  I enjoy seeing jungle changes because of the complete difference in champions.   But Top lane has been pretty dominated by Kennen, Jayce, and things of that nature.  Mid by Syndra, Sol, Ryze, etc.   \n\nJust gut these champions and make room for others.  <3\n\n\nComing from a LoL player since 1994, I mean Season 1.","replies":[]},{"poster":"champagnearci7","date":"2016-12-08T11:02:08.908+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"and could you don't take too much time to focus in him?\nI heard you guys reworked him because it used to be too strong in High elo/competitive plays but he is still in that state.

Outranging can be a problem for things such as Xerath and Ziggs, yeah, though his speed doesn't give him full advantage to make it meaningless.
