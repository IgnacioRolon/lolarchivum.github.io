Good to remember though that Riot isn't the only source for writing feedback - there are huge communities for such things - heck, if you were _evil_, you could maybe even ask Blood Magicks for some feedback while they're still in shock ;)\n\nI didn't check every entry thread over on Polycount, but it did seem like quite a solitary exercise.  Maybe get a bunch of your peers together and provide each other with new perspectives and mutual help over in Concepts and Creations?  Like a writers salon.  \n\nI know it's not the answer you wanted, but I can't just promise work from other Rioters.  This is the first time there was a Narrative category, so maybe think of it as a first tentative step to see how popular, valuable, and/or time-consuming committing to this is.
