She helped other people fight for peace.\n\nThis seems like another case where the character already has lore that can easily be expanded upon (and lore that people like) but gets thrown out the window for some new lore that changes the fundamental ideals of character that people already fell in love with. \n\nNow there is literally zero of Karma left and now her lore is something that could have been added to a new champion or the like.

I don't mind the personality but it just seems like they could have done more, they should have done more, and they continue to do nothing more. There are parts of the new lore I like and parts that I cannot stand one bit. The part I like is actually her personality . . . . she has some character flaws now. What I hate is they took a concept from Avatar and just threw on Karma . . . . and then they sat here and made it to where Karma does nothing but meditate in one spot and refuses to use her abilities. It's lazy writing, it's a lazy Development team that refuse to work on her art and kit problems for five years. It is a problem with Karma from her art, kit, theme and lack of care from any Developer. As long as Ahri and other popular champions exist, Karma will never get anything done on her.\n\nMeddler says he feels sorry that peoples champions are not being worked on. I bet he doesn't feel sorry one bit. He is saying what he wants people to hear. The Developer doesn't care one bit.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"HonestJohnTheCon","date":"2018-04-02T13:44:27.414+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Noxians, huh?
