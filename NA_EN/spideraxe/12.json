Like regular red buff, but weaker, with a 30 second duration or so.\n\nOr an Exp pot that gives 5% bonus exp from minions or 5 exp per second for 30 seconds. (150 exp or 2.75 melee minions)\n\nOr maybe a spell shield elixir that gives a spell shield for 1 second on use. Like nocturne's.\n\nMaybe a gold touch elixir, where you gain 2 gold for every auto or 1 for a damaging spell you use on minions for 45 seconds. max 3 procs per ability. This way you can exchange mana for gold. \n\nWhat if it gave us the old pink ward, which revealed invisible units?\n\nGive this keystone some real unique value other than GP farm. A real reason to risk taking a risky poke to get a really good item.

While its not something that I see being as immediately impactful and thus complained about as Critical Strike, I don't feel like the addition of any RNG effect to the game is a good idea, especially since almost all such effects have been removed (with the only notable exception, Crit, being much complained about). Have you considered any other mechanism for granting the consumable, such as having them drop every Xth Looter proc?","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2017-09-26T00:13:48.281+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, a pseudo RNG effect, with the pseudo part controlling extremes for any particular game. We like the variation that getting power at somewhat different and not completely predictable times adds. Crit chance is problematic because there's nothing to do about, beyond hope you crit/don't get crit. Looter by contrast has its power offered through items you have to use, that will offer power over a period of time rather than a burst of instant damage, so there should be a lot more play both for the user and other players.","replies":[{"poster":"Anonagon","date":"2017-09-26T00:50:18.337+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"While I understand the appeal of varience in reward timings, there will still be times when the RNG of when and/or what consumable drops could dictate a fight. For example, getting a health pot off a proc at the beginning of a fight vs at the end, or a health pot rather than a mana pot. That 150 HP could be the difference between winning and losing a close fight. If you're the one losing a fight you should have won because your opponent happened to get a health pot off a looter proc at the beginning of a fight, or if an enemy survives ignite off such a pot, you're going to feel cheated the same way you do when a 20% crit Draven crits you twice and you die. You wouldn't feel cheated if that HP Pot was something that was timed/on a set cadence, because then the opponent knew they were getting it and could play knowing they had a surprise extra 150HP.","replies":[{"poster":"Kaeblen","date":"2017-09-26T01:14:56.633+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"you could build up \"stacks\" that then trade themselves in for items automatically once you're 5 sec out of combat.\n\nOr the items could appear in inventory already on a 30 second cooldown before they are available to use.\n\nThat way the stolen goods would only help you in future battles, and not right when you get them.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"EROTIC RAID BOSS","date":"2017-09-25T23:43:40.887+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey meddle jw, while I'm not surprised the trap ward with a CD etc didn't work out, what were the issues with it when you sent it to get \"beat up\" by the team","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2017-09-26T00:10:38.415+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Issues around the output (zone control) and how much traps, especially in lane, can alter play.
