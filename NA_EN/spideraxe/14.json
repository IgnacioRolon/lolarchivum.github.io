I both liked it and disliked it.\n\nI think part of the reason that some people received it so poorly is that his conviction / motivation was not shown as strongly in the new lore as the old one. In the old one he accepted evil power (that he fully and rationally knew was evil) into himself, in the new lore he did it because, \"screw the prophecy\" which just doesn't carry as much weight as _knowing_ would. The sacrifice he made by giving himself to the power would have been way more impressive if he knew he was giving himself over to evil.\n\nI would have been 100% happy with the update if he had taken up the power or accepted it already knowing how evil the power was, but instead I'm left feeling a little bit disappointed. It wouldn't even have required much change to the new story in order to preserve this.\n\n**Is there any chance you folks at Riot could do more to avoid doing this kind of unnecessary removal of motives/conviction with characters in the future? It would be nice if the team did more to try to understand what it is that people relate to in characters so that doesn't get lost in character updates.**\n\nIf you have ever seen the anime Boku No Hero, picture the character Stain. He's undeniably in the wrong, but he's cool because he had the conviction to do what many others would not be willing to do if they were in his shoes.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Scathlocke","date":"2018-02-16T21:25:30.553+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for reaching out :-)\n\nI agree with you on many points, and we absolutely will try to avoid this sort of thing, going forward.

There was so much misinformation to the point where it wasn't funny. Honestly does the narrative team actually consider that a success because there were rioters claiming that it was a month ago? Also how do you actually plan to not surprise us with the lore updates because they all sort of just pop up randomly with maybe a notice a month beforehand. \n\nAlso what happend to that Narrative communication about Varus that DyQuil promised a month ago?

I also hope you guys can avoid the whole cheesy \"Varus easily kills everyone in his path until something cute or important to the intellectual property is in the way and his Heartsworn interferes\" scenario the color text laid out.\n\nI would also ask that Wenceslaus not be involved in another champ rewrite after lying about the impact of the Varus changes, but that's just me.

Unfortunately, one bad apple...\n \n> I will also speak to DyQuil and find out what he meant about the communication though - I don&#x27;t think anyone on Narrative has anything to offer, retrospectively, about the Varus update.\n\nIn December, DyQuill promised a direct response from the Varus team to the negative feedback.  This quickly became a \"holistic approach\" essay because, I assume, no one on the team wanted to directly address those concerns or issues.  Even then, the only questions actually addressed were the softball ones.  Questions like \"Why did the team lie when the story was leaked on the PBE?,\" among others, were ignored as \"loaded.\"  (Whatever that means.)\n\nThis was in early January.  Since then, nothing from DyQuill other than some softball nonsense when the Annie video dropped.\n\nI have no idea if DyQuill even writes for Narrative or some other department like Marketing.\n\nIt just seems to me that two months to write a \"this is how we approach our champions\" essay is a bit much given how important it seemed in December.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SgtGenColKled","date":"2018-02-18T17:31:02.536+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Scathlocke,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=H6PcLUcw,comment-id=0003001200000001000000000000,timestamp=2018-02-17T02:27:41.496+0000)\n>\n> I think it&#x27;s been said already, but Narrative was not brought in on Varus until quite a long time after the video&#x27;s lore direction had been created.

You are right about dissonance though, literally everything about Varus now is in dissonance.   Nothing about his kit, playstyle, animations or thematics would ever suggest he is a Darkin.  Two of the most striking features of his model, the scarf and pendant, aren't present at all in the new lore.
