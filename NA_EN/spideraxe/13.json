His poking ability is a far cry from what it was before when it was oppressive, his Q-E damage falls off pretty hard late game due to poor scaling. I much preferred the poke + muramana Jayce style.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hige","date":"2017-01-25T01:18:12.833+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"uhm... so we have to deal with his crazy damage during 2 weeks x_x, that's... awful","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sexy Jack Rabbit","date":"2017-01-25T01:12:35.555+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He's extremely oppressive, do you really think these buffs will do enough?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Asayake 5150glow","date":"2017-01-24T22:15:04.778+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Loving the reduced AD ratio on his passive (although I think it should be removed and more power/thought placed into his W/E). 10 less base damage and 10 more mana is kinda.. meh, tho/","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kaioko","date":"2017-01-24T21:56:01.889+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"As the song goes -- it's easy as 1, 2, 3\n\n1 -- Jayce is currently very strong bordeline oppressive especially in the early game\n\n2 -- Lethality items are receiving an early game buff where instead of scaling from 40% up they will now scale starting at 60%\n\n3 -- Jayce loves his Lethality especially how good he is with Ghostblade and Duskblade","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2017-01-24T21:53:00.824+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"#Hallelujah!","replies":[]}]}
