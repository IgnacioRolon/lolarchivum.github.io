It works when starting the game but after let's say 10 minutes ingame it doesn't. I have no idea why this \"bug\" occurs and I hope that maybe someone used to have the same problem and could fix it somehow. This is especially frustrating when I play Twisted Fate and can't insta-click to let's say botlane to use my ult and gank. I have to move the cursor all the way down, which costs too much time and maybe lead to an unsuccesful gank because I wasn't able to react or to ult faster. Same problem if playing jungle and want to have an overview of how the lanes are going and if someone needs help. This is really annoying :( I tried to repair the client and even download the whole thing again after deinstalling completely but it didn't help unfortunately.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-04T16:13:14.739+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've seen input issues like this with modifications to game files or even hardware.

Porocles I hope you read this for now-- I had some weird stuff going on. My mouse sensativity was reset to 50, however my camera was still set to semi-locked which is my preference. I was not able to left-click on my minimap, just like AidsOnMyFeet. I tried messing with the camera settings and alt+tabbing but I had no luck. I was playing yesterday early morning and did not have this problem. There was a mini-update today and Im guessing this problem is related. I did a quick google search with the time stamp set to past 24 hrs and this post came up- it probably has to do with the mini update. Im repairing my client as we speak and if that doesnt fix it i will send in a ticket. For the record Im not using nay cheats or anything but I did have a low-res rift skin installed for a while. It was uninstalled yesterday though.

For example if you have apps like overlays it may have had a patch which can cause issues.    Additionally, try force resetting your settings one more time to force an update to the servers to try and get this fixed.  \n\n **Log into the game** then hop into **a custom game**. *Alt+Tab* out of the match, then navigate to your League installation folder, which should be in C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\n\nDelete the folder named **Config**\n\nOnce you've deleted the folder, leave the custom match. You'll then want to hop into another custom match to confirm the changes were saved.\n\nLet me know if that works.","replies":[{"poster":"Arath1","date":"2017-08-21T08:47:37.405+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had the same problem. \nThis solution did not help, however something very similar. \n\nActually exactly the same except after second logging to Custom, I restored all settings to defaults.
