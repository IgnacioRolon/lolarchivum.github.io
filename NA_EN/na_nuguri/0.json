I left my client open and went out to get some food. I come back and my computer for some reason is auto-updating. After it finished updating, I try to open client and I get the \"PVP.net Patcher Kernel has stopped working\" message. Normally when this happens, I just run as admin and its fine. At first, everything seemed okay. I got through to the log on screen, was able to log on, and started up a bot game just to make sure everything was alright. However, about 30 seconds into the game, the game freezes up and my computer is totally frozen. So I have to shut off my computer and restart. I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling league, have deleted all of my files, but nothing seems to work. If someone could please help me out or direct me to another forum that would be very much appreciated. Thank you for taking the time to read this and I hope I can find a way to resolve this problem as soon as possible.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-21T17:32:25.111+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like your computer may have just installed the Windows 10 anniversary updates.
