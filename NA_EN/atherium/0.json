It also said that no dodge penalties would be issued to the player that dodged, however when I dodged i was still issued the dodge penalties. Any ideas?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-28T01:55:14.329+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"That message was probably someone using the /me command to emote and not an official Riot message.
