All players are  various pieces on the board, all going for the checkmate. Each with our own limitations\n\nUnfortunately In all my time on this game, I see alot more of people who want to sacrifice the team for personal benefit which frustrates me to no end. Alot of players want to be the \"Solo carry\" (I prefer TEAM CARRY over SOLO carry) and they are willing to abandon or ignore thier team in favor of pushing the solo carry agenda (Teamfight breaks out, and yet rather than help the team, adc sacrifices the rest of the team so they can run off and chase a solo kill in another lane...who ultimately escapes. And they end up leaving thier team to die for a kill they didnt even get in the first place)\n\nI am a Support main, I see it as as Long as I help get my team fed, my job is done. But then I get flamed and completely discounted because support is -not- a \"Kill focused\" role (I can go 0/2/19 and still be told how completely worthless I am as a support because \"look at ur kills\")\n\nSo yeah, it helps to work together, but I think there needs to be a push to change the focus of the matches from the Solo Carry \"MY KILLS\" to the Team Carry \"OUR WIN\"\n\nBig picture player.
