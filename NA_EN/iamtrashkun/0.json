This is because all leaves still cause others a negative experience regardless of intent, but also keep in mind that a penalty would occur after more than just 1 leave.  Just do your best continue to playing without leaves to complete the required games, and you'll be okay!  Let me know if that clears things up!","replies":[]}]}
