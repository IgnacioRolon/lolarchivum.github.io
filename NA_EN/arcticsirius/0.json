Beloved J4 needed it, however Rengar? Why does he get a new splash art when there are others that are more eye-sores such as the Nidalee skins, Blitzcrank, Zilean, or need I remind people the horror that is so vastly different from art and model that is Junkyard Trundle? Also Rengar came out 21/8/12, not too terribly long ago. What doesn't hold up with his current art? Yes it's not the best of 2012, but I wouldn't say so bad it needed a new one to where resources were placed on that above others.\n\nSo what's the deal Riot? Are we going to see these needed splashes soon, or are you going to pound out all the classic splashes first? New players see Rengar and they (should) immediately know what he looks like and what to expect. New players look at the Nidalee line-up and they only have a vague idea of what to expect. New players look at Junkyard Trundle without seeing updated pictures/videos online are being lied to. I'm not mad, just confused. And if you could shed some light on this, that'd be great. Or telling us how the progress (or lack of) for these skins are going would be even better.\n\nI'll place the comparisons down below\n\nOld Rengar (21/8/12)\nhttp://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/img/champion/splash/Rengar_0.jpg\n\nNew Rengar (As of 8/10/14)\nhttp://3.bp.blogspot.com/-0CbYyt4oipk/VDWRAwiBchI/AAAAAAAAabI/9ywCVB-JmbY/s1600/Rengar_Splash_0.jpg\n\nJunkyard Trundle Splash\nhttp://www.leaguesplash.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Junkyard-Trundle.jpg\n\nJunkyard Trundle In-Game Model\nhttp://www.leagueoflegends.pl/NowaWersja/Images/25704120914453938814374727761867918823419976403.png","replies":[{"poster":"Cidem","date":"2014-10-09T18:48:43.232+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"Here's a response from RiotSilver. =)\n\n\n\"Hey guys,\n\nJust a heads up, because I'm seeing a lot of comments wondering why we picked certain splashes to update. We are working on updating a large number of base champion splashes in tandem and integrating them into the game as soon as they become final.\n\nSome splashes move through the pipeline more smoothly than others based on a number of different factors including feedback and resource allocation. A number of the splashes you guys are asking for are in the process of being finalized and we will be integrating them into the game the minute they become final. A few just went in and will probably show up on PBE tomorrow.\n\nWhat this means is that even though splashes like Rengar have been updated does not mean that we are overlooking splashes like Anivia, Shen, Singed, Maokai, Udyr, Etc... It just means that Rengar was finished faster than them for one reason or another.\n\nThe illustration team here is hyper focused on finalizing these splashes as soon as we can and super stoked to be able to show them soon. As always, continue to post feedback and I will do my best to check back in.\"","replies":[{"poster":"bloodmoth","date":"2014-10-09T21:46:41.260+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey thanks for the reply it means alot to hear this from you guys.\n\nQuestion: How big is your splash team? You guys have hinted that it takes a long time for an artist to make one of these splashes, when hearing this and seeing that you are spending resources on champs that dont *NEED* it, its kind of upsetting, but knowing just how many are being worked on at any given time would help soften that blow alot.\n\nfor instance if we knew that you had the strength to work on, say, 20 at any given time, and 15 of those were dedicated to the oldest group, then it would be absolutely fine knowing that rengar wasnt prioritized above them.\n\nI guess the problem is that we see it as a linear pipeline where only one is worked on at a time, so in a stacked list we see rengar above all others when i assume that there are many being worked on in tandem\n\nThanks for the reply at any rate, this has been bugging me :)\nPS new splashes are looking awesome, keep up the good work!

I'm not on the Art team, so I'll be sure to shower them with all your kind words the next time I see them. ^_^\n\nFor the exact size of the Art team, I'm not quite sure. They're spread out on creating a lot of different content. I do see some work-in-progress base splashes, though even I was surprised by the new Cho'Gath base splash when it went to PBE. I had no idea they were working on it. =)\n\nBut ya, some splashes simply take more time to iterate than others.

If that's the case, then it's an issue of priorities, and Cid's answer doesn't actually address the question of \"Why was Rengar prioritized?\". \n\nLet's say they have 3 artists. Those artists are magic, and can do all the work involved on making a new splash art for a single thing, but only one at a time each. Riot could assign them to Nidalee, Shen, and Udyr, in which case Rengar gets no splash before one of those is done. What you're saying is that Riot assigned them to, say, Nidalee and Shen and *Rengar*, in which case the prioritization problem still exists. What I'm saying is that Riot might have 4 magic artists, and so are tackling all 4, which means their priorities are in the right place and Cid's answer works.\n\n(Note: I'm not using the metaphor to condescend; I'm just trying to make sure we're all on the same page.)","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Gixia","date":"2014-10-09T02:29:06.882+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"They've already said they will not be updating outdated splash arts for skins, as they decided the resources would be better allocated elsewhere.\n\nThat said, there are plenty of base splash arts that are still in need of replacing, so that still doesn't explain why Rengar got one.
