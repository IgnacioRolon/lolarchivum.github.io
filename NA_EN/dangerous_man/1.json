I got Twitch and I was so terribly bored of this champion that felt like I had no abilities I had to leave. I don't mind ADCs that actually feel like they've got cool gameplay elements, but playing a purely AA ADC against a bunch of mages was just so boring and pointless I had to stop (I didn't rage/get mad don't worry, no toxicity just want to play the fun part of this game). Don't worry about me being that one player in ranked I wouldn't do this in a match where it matters.\nSo now do I have to wait 10 mins or is it possible to skip over this? I mean I'd rather wait than reconnect because I don't even do anything in the game other than auto attack so I'd rather just watch youtube for 10-15 minutes and wait for the game to be over.\nhttps://i.gyazo.com/a05e4cfc2cbf7ea6195ed0a3c184e6a9.png","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-20T01:42:24.939+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since your account is tied to that game, you won't be able to play until the game is finished. it might have been best to rejoin the game though so you didn't leave your teammates hanging =\\ .\n\nI wouldn't do this too often either as eventually it could lead to long low priority queues.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dangerous Man","date":"2017-12-20T21:03:35.298+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You just repeated yourself, thanks that's so helpful","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dangerous Man","date":"2017-12-20T01:53:49.978+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't do it often, I select games that are exceedingly terrible to play through.\nI mean what's the point in playing the game if you hate it, so I left.

I could care less if the automated system tries to prevent me.","replies":[{"poster":"Kokua","date":"2017-12-20T04:37:57.804+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, we care if you leave, and the system will remember EVERY TIME you have left a game.

I've gotten the punishments it's really weird how you guys act as if I've never played the game, you assuming idk how it works. I leave a load and I could get banned, darn, because I don't leave that often.","replies":[{"poster":"Kokua","date":"2017-12-20T06:58:09.937+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You shouldn't leave, even in \"cancer games\", as you're leaving your team at an even heavier disadvantage than you thought you already were. When I said it remembers EVERY TIME i do mean EVERY TIME. Punishments get worse as you continuously knowingly break the rules.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
