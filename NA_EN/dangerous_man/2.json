In theory, a properly shielded microwave shouldn't leak any radiation, but the reality is that they leak quite a bit, resulting in electromagnetic, or radio-frequency (RF), interference. And yes, Wi-Fi is a radio signal, but it's broadcasting on a much higher frequency than most broadcast radios operate on.\n\nThis is one of the many reasons why we [recommend ](https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/page/ethernet-vs-wifi-ping-packets-playing-better) that players play League on Ethernet instead of wifi. \n\nWhile I'm here, I'm also going to recommend that people check out [LagReport.com](http://www.lagreport.com).
