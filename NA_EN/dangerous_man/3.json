Don't blame either of you though; surprisingly there's not a lot of places to research info on autofill. That's something that might need to be changed. x_x\n\nAnywho, to directly address your issue, right now there's a graphical bug that's causing the little flag in the lobby to incorrectly state Autofill is activated, even if you have protection. Like you said though, playing a game filled or as Support will protect you from autofill the next game (not 2, iirc). Even if the bug shows up, you still have protection and should be matched into game as such.\n\nWhat Kokua was likely thinking of is the chance you have of being autofilled each game if you haven't recently played Support or filled. For more info on that I'd recommend you read up on [**this Ask Riot article here**](https://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/2017/06/ask-riot-autofilled/).

You have a greater chance of receiving autofill protection if you voluntarily play support or fill rolls, but it is not guaranteed. You have a chance to get autofill protection if you are filled into another role, such as support, but still it is not guaranteed.","replies":[]}]}
