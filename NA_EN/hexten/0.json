As we kick off the 6.6 PBE cycle, today's patch includes Aurelion Sol, new skins for Draven, Maokai, Tahm Kench, and Vel'Koz, a new ward skin, new summoner icons, DRAVEN minions, a pre-Alpha PBE test of the LCU, a ton of balance changes, and more!","url":"http://www.surrenderat20.net/2016/03/38-pbe-update.html","image":"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-_wvXstQ2Y-4/Vt_FjvR4U-I/AAAAAAAA4sc/HCh61zNytNA/w1200-h630-p-nu/55555.jpg"},"up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"In today&#039;s patch the Gunblade changes were removed but they were:\r\n\r\n** Hextech Gunblade**\r\n\r\n    Unique active:\r\n\r\n*         Renamed to &quot;Capture Bolt&quot;\r\n*         Notes it the active shares a cooldown with other Bolt items.\r\n*         Damage increased to 200 from 150.\r\n\r\nAny reason into why changes to the item in the first place?
