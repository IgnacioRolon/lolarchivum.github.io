When we got into Champion select he noticed that one of his Summoner spells (SS) was missing. When he went to Choose his second SS he was met with the conclusion that the client did not let him. We assume that the missing spell would pop up during game and go ahead with the match. It doesn't. After the game was over we tried waiting for stats but nothing arose, so he restarts his client and we Que up again, only to run into the same issue. At this point were like what ever and go ahead and play the game anyways. After the game we await the stats page and notice that it has not popped up again, \"hmm that's odd\" we both said. My Friend then points out to me that he hasn't received any completed matches into his placement games, and notes out to me that i haven't been gaining any LP or ip for the matches we played. We immediately react in disbelief, realizing that the last hour and half were a complete waste of time. In Order to Prove our hypothesis we Played our Third and final match of the night. We lost this one sadly and was waiting to see how much LP i had lost. Once again we could not view the stats page as it had not popped up even after waiting 5 minutes for it. I went to check to see if any LP was lost, and nothing had changed. If somebody can Help me out here and figure out if this bug is something that is happening to other people as well, or just us, And how we can Fix this. We would Greatly appreciate it. Thanks in advance.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-03-26T22:44:52.501+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your friend might have a corrupted file somewhere in his LoL game files =\\ . I'd suggest having him grab our [Hextech Repair Tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367-Automated-Troubleshooting-Hextech-Repair-Tool) and run it with force repatch/reinstall enabled.  This way we can be sure he has a fresh install of the game to work with.\n\nAs far as your LP/IP not updating correctly, sometimes you can see a delay between when you get the points and when they actually update in the client. Not to worry, unless it's been days you're still not seeing the IP you should have. At that point, feel free to reach out to us in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and we can look deeper into what happened!","replies":[]}]}
