You only roam as a mage if you poked the enemy out of lane, to do this, especially against assassins, simply AA them and hit them with your easiest to land skill shot continually, but only when they try to CS, this way they miss CS, can't push the lane back, and risk dying, all at the same time. So for Xerath, zed walks up to his minion wave to farm, press W the big circle hits him, if it's possible to land your E, do it, then your Q. Then he should be about 75%, if you can't hit E, then simply repeat step 1. If you did do it then now he has only two options, Back and miss CS then roam(punish him hard if he does this.) or stay and try and get the CS. In both cases, he loses something from it, so if he chooses option 1, first push his wave under tower, if your high enough health, roam before he does so he can't do anything at all, if it isn't possible for you to roam, simply back and ping. If he chooses option 2, roam before he does, this way he's way to low to go and roam with you, and if he backs or roams he loses way to much. \n\nBasically it's all about how you play your lane, when i play assassins myself i always hate a good Syndra, Lux or Xerath, because i basically can't do a damned thing if they play the lane right. \n\nLast tip, ward in places where you can see a lot of things all at once, mostly a control ward, this way you don't have to be as scared as usual and make sure to ping your allies to do the same, and most of all, the second you see your enemy laner back, ping it this way they know he's backing and can hopefully be ready for a gank bot lane.","replies":[{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2017-07-19T09:51:09.463+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pretty good tips.  Just a couple things I want to adjust.\n\n1: When harassing in lane, generally just use Q and autos when you can.  If you get the chance and land an E on them go up for an auto and then Q.  This will proc Thunderlord's and give you a ton of mana back if you have your passive up (which is super valuable for pushing them out of lane).  The only time I really use W in the laning phase is during a gank or if the enemy is really low (and may die to a follow up Q/auto).\n\n2: Post 6 if your enemy laner roams and you can follow a safe distance back, you can often turn the tides of the gank with a few ult shots and clean up if necessary with a flash W Q.  Just be careful that your laner is far enough away that you can get away if they decide to run at you instead of your allies.\n\nNow some specifically ult-related tips.\n\nWhen ulting, you want to adjust how you aim between each shot, don't follow the same patter for all of them.  I typically try to predict their movements forward for the first 1 or 2 and then shoot directly on top of them (many opponents expect you to shoot ahead at that point and are thus surprised when you shoot right where they're standing).  Basically think of it as a mind game more than a matter of aiming.\n\nIf you have teammates chasing an enemy on the otherhand, and they can kill said enemy without you actually landing any ult shots, shoot all of them just ahead of the fleeing enemy.  They'll have to either tank the shots (and likely die to them) or juke back a bit, helping your team to catch up.","replies":[{"poster":"Zerenza","date":"2017-07-19T15:07:52.449+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you :) I'm bronze and don't play xerath much(not to mention i have SOOOO much trouble landing his Q) so your adjustments are very useful to me and hopefully to this guy to.","replies":[{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2017-07-19T20:52:32.897+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Xerath is my main (not one-trick though), so I like giving tips on playing him. :)\n\nIt's also nice to hear people interested in playing him rather than just accusing his players of scripting.\n\nAs for landing his Q, it's a bit tough to describe what I do.  I suppose the way I'd describe it is kind of similar to the ult shots.  Basically I try to predict where they think I will shoot it.  So I try to predict when they will double back or even just try to sprint faster forward (like with Ahri Q).  Because of this, it's a little wild.  I hit pretty darn often, but when I miss, it's sometimes pretty far off (they juke back when I think they'll sprint for example).\n\nAgainst other immobile mages like Annie for instance, you can generally just aim straight on them and it'll hit.  Just always be careful to not get in range of their cc or even flash -> cc if they can 100->0 you.  Actually, specifically against Annie I prefer to play Lux because 1: Tibbers alone can't block her snare (unlike Xerath stun) and 2: Lux doesn't self-slow, which can make it easier for Annie to catch you.\n\nOh one last tip (unless you ask for more).  I almost always run scaling CDR runes.  10% if I'm grabbing {{item:3165}} and {{item:3157}} or {{item:3102}} and 20% if just {{item:3165}}.  You should almost never be building all three because that will fairly severely reduce your damage.\n\nSo my builds are (in no particular order):\n20% CDR runes + {{item:3165}}{{item:3020}}{{item:3285}}{{item:3151}}{{item:3089}}{{item:3135}}\n10% CDR runes + {{item:3165}}{{item:3020}}{{item:3285}}{{item:3089}}{{item:3135}} + {{item:3102}}/{{item:3157}}\n\nThe 20% CDR runes build gives immense damage (I can usually kill the enemy adc late-game with just my ult assuming typical shielding).  This can allow you to stop baron attempts without putting yourself in significant danger.\n\nThe 10% CDR runes build gives noticeably less damage (the loss of 15 magic pen is massive on squishies), but the utility can more than make up for it.  Banshee's is particularly helpful against teams that hope to pick off individuals.  Zhonya's can be incredible against dive comps assuming you are the target.  Oftentimes enemies will tunnel so hard on you that popping Zhonya's and letting your team clean up will win you the teamfight.\n\nThat's more than I planned on writing xD\n\nIf you want to, feel free to add me (this is my main account), and I can help you a little bit in a custom game sometime (not today though).","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Starcraft243ver","date":"2017-07-19T17:15:58.732+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The trick is to shove the lane so much he can't roam at all. \n\nStill, if he went bot, you can still take the path of your jungle to join the bot tower safely and countergank. \nOr you can go top, since you know he isnt there.","replies":[{"poster":"Weasel Kensei","date":"2017-07-19T23:15:25.149+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mages really shouldnt shove vs Zed unless the player is just total trash.

Since the enemy jg is in the lane you can roam up there without getting surprised. If your jg is around top, sometimes you can lay a trap for your mid opponent as they try to follow you.\n\nThe most important time to roam is when you are fed and you can go to another lane and blow up somebody. This will help put the snowball down the hill faster.\n\nAll that said, Xer isnt a very good roamer. Your best bet would be to walk part way down to bot/top and launch your ult from the jg to harass/kill someone staying in lane with low health. You can do some decent damage with Xer ult with a short time investment, and it will give you some practice.\n\nTry to avoid roaming if your opponent has really strong waveclear. Champs like Anivia, Ziggs, and Brand can be very dangerous to leave in a lane alone for long as they can blow up waves quickly and hit your tower for 33%+ just because you walked down to bot lane fired off a rotation and then backed and walked back to lane.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SB Arneeman","date":"2017-07-19T23:13:05.057+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How much you can roam is very dependant on both your champion and enemy champions. Artillery mages(Xerath, Vel'koz, etc) are generally bad at roaming. The enemies will be prepared to dodge skillshots when you appear, and they will be running away so projectiles effectively have shorter range. Immobile champions can also easily be collapsed on. \n\nChampions with reliable CC are often good roamers since you can let your teammates do much of the damage. The lane needs to have some DPS to the enemy champion, though.\n\nChampions with high mobility and damage, assassins, are good roamers. They can force kills easily and have enough damage to secure them. Roams are also a great way of snowballing on these champions.\n\nGenerally, you want to look for roams mostly when you can fight the enemy midlaner or 2v2 with the junglers. A vision advantage is also very good to have when roaming. Before you roam, push out a wave the moment it comes into the lane and move out of vision so the enemy doesn't see what side you roam to. If you have vision of them, you should usually follow the enemy mid if they are roaming.\n\nSome factors that decide if you want to roam to a lane are how strong the enemy champions and allies are, how they are positioning and their health. Ganking an enemy that is far ahead of yours can be very risky since the fight easily can be turned around. With long range mages low health enemies are especially good to roam to since you can kill them from safe range even if they are not that aggressively positioned.\n\nA very smart strategy is to wait in one of the small bushes in river to ambush the enemy midlaner(put a vision ward or sweep it). Either fake a roam or assassinate them when they return from a roam without full health and cooldowns down. You can freely hit all skillshots if they walk into you. Be careful though, they may collapes on you with their jungler!\n\nWhen it comes to warding, the small bushes on the side of midlane are good places to put vision wards, and the end of the river walls are a good place to put normal wards. The long bush closest to mid is often a bad place to ward since it doesn't give much vision compared to other areas.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vigilente","date":"2017-07-19T21:52:15.679+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Roam after the lane is pushed.

Mobile mids can roam better because they can escape and fight in close quarters better, generally. As an immobile mid you can still roam but having vision of the path you are taking or vision of the enemy team is important because you don't want to die on the path to the other lane, and you want your gank to mean something since you will lose out on some exp and gold because it takes you so long to roam since you probably don't have good movespeed as an immobile mid. Try to get a kill and if possible an objective, because if you don't then you'll probably be behind your laner. If you're doing a counterroam you'll both be in the same situation, but if one of you kills the other while roaming that person will have a lead. Zed would kill you while roaming so it's not a good idea to go in the same direction as him. Push your lane and farm, or gank top instead if you think you can pull something off.","replies":[]}]}
