Urgot has been well over do for literally anything. It does not have to be a a major rework, but just a few minor kit changes would be glorious. His ult has literally no use at all so if you changed his ult to work more for his Q that would be magnificent! Make him a machine gun turret like Kog used to be. Also the last Urgot skin we got was Battlecast which is around 2-3 years ago... Please do something with this champion. This goes for Galio too!","replies":[{"poster":"Requiemsfire","date":"2016-12-06T20:37:08.780+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well Urgot's ult does have a use, it's just very niche and doesn't fit with the marksmen playstyle.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Prophet of Urgod","date":"2016-12-12T19:41:17.820+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Everything that has been stated in the post and the comments I have seen dozens of times.

He actually has a pretty solid winrate, although that may be influenced by his 0.3% pickrate.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BeatzBoyFTW","date":"2016-12-06T20:49:52.273+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"His EQ combo is still pretty toxic, so I wouldn't want to ask for a single buff til his rework kicks in.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DucksAreMagical","date":"2016-12-06T20:43:59.696+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Galio is decent, just his Ult is all of his Kit.\n\nUrgot top is a pain, for melee tops because of the constant harass.\n\nAatrox is like a shitty Yi, 1 Leap and 1 slow with that W.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KONO TEEMO DAAA","date":"2016-12-07T19:37:25.631+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So to be clear. I like the idea of him as a lane bully and that's how i think he should stay. However, his ult is just not a proper fit to his play style. He's not a tank and he is not an ADC more of a weird bruiser but at the same time not. He is just in a weird undefined spot so I would like to see him placed in a more clear spot or position.
