Essentially, packet loss is when some of the data going between your network and our servers gets lost or corrupted so that neither our servers or your pc can read it correctly. This can cause some preeeeetty weird stuff to happen like skyrocketing ping or champions moonwalking around and ignoring your commands. \n\nCheck out our [**log reader**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743) using the latest network logs of the game that had these ping spikes. That will be able to tell us just what kind of lag we're dealing with, so take a screenshot and post it here for us to go over together.","replies":[]}]}
