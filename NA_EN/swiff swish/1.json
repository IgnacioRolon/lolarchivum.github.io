I turned it on and it works great. I was wondering if I could edit it as well. I did some digging into some really old posts and saw there was a file in which you could edit it, but I couldn't find it. I even searched the whole folder for it and it was unavailable along with some other trying searches. Was just wondering if the file is still there and is still able to edit because I would love to make my own light system for certain circumstances. I'm sure this isn't as much as a big deal as everything else is going on, and i'm sure i am the only one who cares about this since everyone else thinks Alienwares are trash :/. Just hit me up when you can please.\r\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \r\n -WWR Swiff","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-14T03:40:14.808+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm sure it's probably still possible to get those files edited and working in a different way, but I'm not gonna have that info sadly.

The keyboard works fine, the Alienware product works perfectly fine. It lights up perfectly fine in game to specific moments. I was just wondering where the file is in the league of legends folder if it still is there. \n\nhere is what the old post says: http://forums.euw.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=65215\n\nclearly that file location does not exists anymore, so where is that file?\n\nI wanted to edit the color schematic for different colors than what they are now. The file must be somewhere since you still offer the AlienFX ability in the settings. so the code is there somewhere.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-15T04:14:52.072+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea sorry, I'm not super familiar with those files or how AlienFX worked since it came out so long ago (that post was from 2010).\n\nI was able to do some quick google searches and found a little newer info.

If this doesn't work any longer I'd consider reaching out to Alienware's support to see about getting this type of lighting function working again.\n\n1. Go into C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config\n2. Open the game.cfg file (with something like wordpad)\n3.

I guess there might not be any way of editing it then anymore rip :/.
