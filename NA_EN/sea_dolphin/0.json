Welcome to LoL\n\nFirst off, I can help you out here as far as tips and what-not but I probably won't have time to coach you in-game, sorry.\n\nThat being said, answer time!\n\n>so I've been playing a Katarina mid/fiora top and I've noticed that I can go games like 40/5 but sometimes I get absolutely destroyed and go negative. Is it because of my opponents teams? Or is it just because I'm not playing carefully??\n\nThere are a lot of factors that can go into a game and how well you do, and not just kill/death. How much gold you've gotten from farming (last hitting minions), objectives like dragon/baron/turrets and your general team composition (the champs your team has and how well they do together) all play a part.\n\nHowever, seeing as your playing Kat/Fiora there's probably a good chance you've noticed how much those specific champs 'snowball'. What that means is that if they get early kills and get ahead of their laning opponents they can hold onto that momentum very easily. I'll bet those games you've gone 40-some you were able to get a few kills early in the game.\n\n>I've heard a lot about like bronze and gold and silver tiers but I don't know where these are?? I'm playing solo queue but there no tiers?\n\nThat's referring to ranked play. If you look through your available ques in a specific map you'll notice a \"ranked solo/duo\" option. This won't be available until you are level 30 and you have more than 17 champions owned (the latter being because of how Draft Pick works, which I can explain if you'd like). Like most accolades a lot of players like bragging and/or using their rank as proof of experience. Take it with a grain of salt howeve, even the highest ranked players can have a bad day.\n\nThe order from lowest to highest goes: Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Diamond, Master and Challenger tier. Master Challenger being pro-level.\n\n>which champions should I use? Are fiora and katty good for a beginner or should I try more challenging champions?? I feel that these two champions are super easy to play so Ive stuck with them\n\nUp to you! Naturally there are a lot of options, so I'd advise you to find a role/lane you like, try to master that and then expand to other roles when you feel comfortable. Buying the champions that do your preferred role first of course. I can further explain each role and what they do if you'd like.\n\nIf you don't mind a bit of reading you can take a gander [here](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/tips-tricks/T1i49i33-guide-league-basics), it's meant to help out new players who want to 'read-ahead' and get an edge.","replies":[{"poster":"ChaosThief","date":"2015-04-16T21:41:19.715+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sir ArmaMalum...\nhttps://pbs.twimg.com/media/BoXQBkRCQAAQqIy.jpg:large","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kindlejack","date":"2015-04-16T20:25:16.765+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":0,"body":"The good Sir ArmaMalum has already provided some solid answers. I'll add a couple of things that I think would have helped me a lot when I started out.\n\nGetting gold from minions by getting the last hit that kills them (known as cs'ing or Last-hitting) is really important in lane as the items that you buy from the store give you a lot of your power, especially if you are playing a character that gets their damage from their basic attacks. The decisions you make around what items to buy are also important - Katarina should try and build items that give her the most Ability Power (AP) like Rabadon's Deathcap {{item:3089}} and items that will help her when she uses her Shunpo to jump in like Zhonya's Hourglass {{item:3157}}. Whereas Fiora will want to build Attack Damage (AD) that synergises with her abilities such as Ravenous Hydra {{item:3074}} and The Black Cleaver {{item:3071}}. If you can get enough gold to complete some of these items before your opponents do it will give you a big advantage in fights as you begin to leave your lanes and fight as a team.\n\nTry all the champions during free week! Even if you just play vs bots to see how they are, this will do two really important things for you.\n1) You might just come across a champion that suits your play style. Many times I've tried out a champion and then fallen in love, either with their personality or their set of abilities (called a 'kit'). I tried Rek'sai when she first came out not thinking she would be my kind of champion as I mostly like AP Mages that blow people up in one combo, but there are so many things about the way she feels to play that excited me - the sound of her tremor sense, the feel of hunting people, the savage attacks - that I've been playing almost nothing but Rek'sai the last few weeks. I even got my first ranked Pentakill (when you kill all 5 enemy champions in a row) with her!\n2) One of the biggest learning curves in LoL is not how to play your champion/s but to know how to play against the other 123! The best way to at least have an idea of what your opponent is capable of and where their strengths and weaknesses lie is to play those champions for yourself a few times. It's funny how when I play someone like Lux I'm very careful of my positioning and constantly worried about ganks or getting too close, while when I am against a Lux it just feels like she is raining down death upon me with relative immunity from a safe distance. If you know what your opponent will try and do or when one of their key abilities is on a long cooldown and can't be used if you attack right now, you have a big advantage.\n\nLastly I feel like what really opened my eyes to the deeper strategies of LoL was watching some of the pro tournaments. These days you can also watch a variety of streamers on Twitch too. Just watching them play and listening to the shoutcasters/streamers gives a lot of insight. Sure we might not be able to play as well as they do but it gives you a good look at where you can improve.\n\nGood luck, have fun!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sea Dolphin","date":"2015-04-16T18:27:25.493+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks guys!!

The important part is to have fun, it's a video game, afterall :)\n\nOne thing I would recommend, as Kindlejack has already mentioned, is to take advantage of the free champion rotation to try out every champion (except Yorick :P he was removed from the rotation since he has some underlying problems at the moment), and keep an open mind and try champions again, even if it's just loading up a custom game by yourself to test out the champion's abilities; there have been many cases where the first time I played a champion, I really didn't like them, but later on, especially as my skills improved, I really came to like them. Overall though, as far as what champions you *should* be playing, play the ones you like, honestly. Playing champions you actually enjoy playing will encourage you to improve at them, and help you learn the game in the process.\n\n---------\n\n#Information dump:\n\n(I'm just leaving this all here for you to go at your own pace, don't feel pressured to learn all of this immediately; this is mostly just for reference or to give you a starting point. Like I said before, there is a lot of information in this game, honestly it took me a good year or so to feel like I had a decent knowledge of the game, though I was a bit stubborn about looking up information on the internet at first, so it probably won't take you as long)\n\n(I also want to say up front that nothing in this game is dogma; you can pull off anything so long as you know what you're doing and are sufficiently skilled, though of course the game is designed to make some things easier than others. The following resources are a good starting point though, and can give some good guidance, but take them with a grain of salt and always use your brain to figure out *why* things are a certain way, etc.)\n\nAs far as resources, beyond Sir ArmaMalum's guide (and the guides within that one), 2ez.gg is a very helpful resource that basically aggregates a ton of popular LoL related sites and resources into one window/tab. Just some guidance on some my favorite sites;\n\n* Surrender@20/ReignOfGaming are two popular news sites and also post information on PBE patches, which kind of give you a heads up on possible changes coming to the game (though I wouldn't worry too much about this when you're still learning the game);\n* op.gg and LoLKing have a lot of useful statistics and information, as well as histories of your personal games if you want to go back and look at your statistics (and you can also use the Match History tool that Riot provides; each one provides slightly different information);\n* ProBuilds is a great site that pulls information from professional player's games so you can learn what items/runes/masteries they're building and how they use their skill points, etc. it's a good place to start if you're trying to learn a new champion (also watching youtube videos of those players/champions);\n* ChampionSelect.net and Champion.gg both give good stats on champions and can give some guidance on how champions interact;\n* and last but not least, LoLWiki will be your best friend.\n\nWatching streams and VoD's (video on demand) on twitch/youtube or other sites (ie. azubu, etc) can be very helpful, often more than just playing a bunch of games, since you're often learning from the experience of a more experienced player. Two of my favorites are:\n\n* Nightblue3: He's a high ranked jungler (it's likely that jungling isn't something you'll see a whole lot of until lvl 30), but his stream is largely devoted to teaching how to play jungle, which I think can help give a broader perspective of the game even if you don't play jungle\n* ls: He's currently the head coach of Gravity, a professional team. He's someone who really understands the game, his youtube coaching videos (his youtube username is lastshadow9) really opened my mind to how the game really works. Bear in mind that his coaching style can be a bit aggressive, and that he tends to dump a ton of information into his videos, so it can be a bit much to take in all at once, but the concepts that he discusses are incredibly valuable when learning to play.\n\nGood luck, and remember to have fun!

Champions such as \n\n{{champion:114}} \n{{champion:80}} \n{{champion:14}} \n{{champion:150}} \n\nThey are all top laners and I think it's best to find one that fits you.

I'd say ArmaMalum and KindleJack seem to have covered just about everything.\nI'd disagree about maining a specific roll right our the gate. Find the champs you like (Free champ rotation is great for this) and focus on them; chances are you'll eventually find yourself falling into place somewhere.\n\nWhen I started out, I played support exclusively (largely because nobody else ever wanted it). I did this until the role got a slight overhaul in S4, at which point I had practically no experience in other lanes and match-ups (I'm still a terri-bad ADC, and can't CS to save my life).\n\nThe biggest thing I'd recommend focusing on early/now are base line mechanics. I'll admit that's not exactly a small task - but just getting started will put you leaps and bounds above the competition in the long run.\n\nWhat I mean by that:\n\n+ Warding\n + Vision probably isn't a big factor in your games yet, but it's a big deal the higher up you go the proverbial ladder. Ward at the edge of bushes (INSIDE THE BUSH!) and in high traffic areas. And get in the habit of warding (The yellow trinkets are ***free wards***)\n+ CS'ing\n + \"CS\" stands for \"creep score\" (don't ask). It refers to how many minions / jungle monsters you've killed. LoL only counts something as a kill if you get the last hit on it. Getting the last hit grants gold. For newer players, most gold tends to come from kills. However, 1 kill is worth about 300 gold; 300 gold is about 2 minion waves (not counting cannon minion). So even when a person dies, if they have +24ish CS, the kill value becomes incremental.\n+ not standing still, not running strait\n + A lot of newer champs have skill shots; a lot of older champs are getting reworked to have them. Standing still makes you a lot easier to target, so always move as much as possible. Also, try to move unpredictably. If I know where you're going, I'll still hit you. And while \"the shortest distance between 2 points is a strait line\", \"the time it takes to cross a chess board is the same whether you move straight or diagonally\". So if you're trying to run away, don't be afraid to zig-zag.\n+ encourage teamwork, don't rage.\n + People have bad games. They get worked up and rage in chat. we've all been there. Just remember, negativity makes games harder to win. Positivity makes games easier. (There's a lot of stats and studies behind this concept, I'm not even going to bother pulling them up).\n+ Have fun. (The hardest one, I'm sure.)\n + I don't care if you're the unbeatable god of this game. If you don't have fun, you lost. Plain and simple. It's a game. Enjoy your self.\n\nLike I said, these are base-line mechanics. They lay the foundation for high level play (where most people generally want to end up). There's a lot of other things you'll eventually learn, such as minion manipulation (\"CS'ing\"), positioning (\"Not stand still\"), Counter-warding (\"warding\"), Zoning (\"CS'ing\" & \"not stand still\"), and Early lvl advantage scenarios (\"minion manipulation\", \"Positioning\" , & \"zoning\"). But they're only icing on the cake.\n--------------------------------------------\n\nIf you have any questions while logged in, I'd recommend popping into the \"LOL university\" chat. They're not quite as active as they used to be, but you can generally still find someone willing answer any questions or give a helping hand.\n\nAnd feel free to add me in game.

I agree with everything except zig-zagging while running away. If you're low health and I'm chasing you, zig zagging may help if you have a good lead and all I have is skill shots, but if I'm running straight down the lane and you're zig-zagging at some point I'm gonna catch you or at least get close enough to land a skill or two. \nAlso, when youre running/chasing at top or bottom lane, stick to the wall closer to the river, youll have less distance to cover.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"lvl 2 lagspike","date":"2015-04-17T20:47:52.381+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Seems like other people already answered all your questions quite nicely.\nIf you got any more question feel free to me ingame (same nick ingame as here)..

Abuse the free rotation champs to help learn the full spread of league mechanics, and buy up some cheap champions(450 and 1350 tier) to give yourself both a good variety and some strong options.  This'll also make it easier to save up IP for runes, as you haven't broken the bank buying 6300 IP champions.\n\n>  [{quoted}](name=SeaDolphin123,realm=NA,application-id=WEuoGbmp,discussion-id=oudWKA0c,comment-id=,timestamp=2015-04-16T17:12:38.931+0000) \n>  \n> 4) is anyone willing to play with me and give me pointers in game??

That means that if you don't get enough golds in early game (with kills or farm), you'll have an hard time killing your enemy without your items. If you're behind as Fiora or Katarina, you're useless (well, Fiora is good at getting towers and splitpushing with Tiamat).\n\n> 2) I&#039;ve heard a lot about like bronze and gold and silver tiers but I don&#039;t know where these are??

Glad to see you're actually having fun!\n\nThere have been a lot of replies, so I'll try not to step on anyone's toes when I go in and give advice. I figure about the only thing that hasn't been covered is branching out your champion selection. A lot of new players stick very closely to one champion. I've seen people who are max summoner level that say that they can only play one champion. It's refreshing to see someone who actively looks for new champions to play!\n\nSome champions make others easy to learn; if you've played a lot of one champion, there are others that are similar enough to that champion that they would be relatively easy to figure out, but are still different enough that they have advantages and disadvantages. A champion that comes to mind when thinking of Katarina is Zed. You play him in the mid lane, you have some abilities that function a little like Katarina's Shunpo (E), and her Sinister Steel (W) but has quite a lot more... mobility. He does have an energy meter, which is somewhere between katarina and a mana-based champion; energy is kinda like magic, but it caps out a lot lower. However, abilities typically have lower cost, and energy comes back much faster than mana. Anyway, Zed has a similar reputation as Katarina for being very strong, very difficult to beat, but not as difficult to master.\n\nAnother very mobile melee mid is Fizz. Fizz is also know for carrying the game hard and dealing really high damage. He also has one ability that makes him very slippery and hard to catch.\n\nAfter you master some of these easier champions, you can get into more complicated mids like Yasuo. At the current moment, I don't recommend you take up Yasuo, because, yes, he has a lot of power. If played right, he may have just as much, if not more, power that Katarina. However, this power is locked behind his complicated mechanics. Many of his abilities are, as many community members would say, \"overloaded.\" This means that most of his skills do multiple things, or behave differently under certain circumstances, making him versatile, but as a result, complicated.\n\nSo in a sort of gradient, those are some recommendations. However, if you would like some suggestions for other roles, I suppose I could do some of those...\n\nTaking into consideration that you're comfortable with Katarina and Fiora, you might want to look into assassins in roles. For instance, you may want to pick up master yi for jungling when you get to learning how the jungle works (I apologize if you already know how to jungle). Yi tends to be more like Fiora. You build AD, you are pretty fragile, but when you get some kills, you're darn near unstoppable. What's more is Yi goes freely around the map, getting mostly free farm without people trying to poke him, and as far as the enemy knows, you could be anywhere when you decide to drop in and attempt to murder someone.\n\nYou may also like Pantheon as a top or jungler. He's pretty equally strong in both roles. He has a bit of a safer playstyle than Fiora, but he has some pretty awesome powers that could be neat to try.\n\nAs for adc's, you could probably give Caitlyn a try. She's known for being good for beginners, and has many tools that keep her strong in the later levels as well. She also has the longest base auto attack range in the game. Graves may also be a good choice. The adc role is probably one of the least diverse, because all of them have to be long ranged, auto-attack based, with some form of attack speed increase, or something that makes autoattacking worth while. That's not to say they're all the same, but they mostly have to have those attributes. However, there is one that I recommend you stay away from for now, and that would be Kalista... she's pretty complicated, and her ult is very risky, or could end up backfiring if you don't know how to use it properly. Even then it still is a bit of a gamble. If her kit really impresses you, then you should probably try Twitch first, as he has some slightly similar mechanics, but in a way that is much more user-friendly.\n\nAs for supports, this role may not be your cup of tea. Supports are rather passive by nature, perhaps sometimes passive-aggressive. As someone comfortable with assassins, you may want to lean towards more agressive supports like leona, morgana, blitzcrank, or thresh, in relative order of difficulty to play. Leona is probably one of the easiest, because she's difficult to kill, and has loads of cc, morgana requries a bit more of a skill shot to land her cc, but does pretty good damage. Blitzcrank has a high-risk high reward pull that can change the game if you land it reliably, and thresh.... oh, boy thresh. He has a similar skillshot with his hook. The difference is that he has a slight windup before he throws it. If it hits, you can drag people around a bit and jump to them before the break free to do some damage. His other skills make him one of the strongest supports, but they need to be used wisely. For instance, his lantern can be unruly, but you can save lots of people with it. When they click the lantern, it will teleport them to you, and it also grants a shield to allies. Flay is another one of his skills that's pretty unruly for beginners but is a godsend if you know how to use it. His ult is also one of the most powerful slows in the game, so he has a lot going for him if you know how to unlock his potential.\n\nIf you'd like to play a few games with me, I could be up for it. Just add me in game, and I could give you tips. I'm not the best player, but I have some good game knowledge that could be helpful. Not to mention, I am a pretty good support jungler (or a jungler that mainly secures kills for his teammates when he comes to your lane to lend a hand, as well as towers and other useful things) so it makes for a good time when giving people tips.\n\noh yeah, also, sorry for the wall of text... I just like helping people around here who are willing to listen and learn instead of just ranting ^/////^","replies":[{"poster":"DeloricVI","date":"2015-04-17T06:51:48.861+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh yes, and something very good to do before trying a champion, is to look up a guide. Sometimes, there might be an items you wouldn't think was so great, but for some reason is much more powerful on a certain champion. For instance, when I first started playing Teemo, I never knew that Liandry's Torment was good for him. Then I realized just how well that item worked when combined with his other abilities, and I found that out by looking up a guide. There's no shame in it; in fact, I encourage it! \n\nJust remember that you can always break away from that guide to suit the situation or your own personal preference. If you like Frozen Mallet better than Black Cleaver for your Fiora build, then go for it, as long as it makes sense. Or, if you need magic resistance, you might be able to swap that Luden's Echo for an Abyssal Scepter, or get Mercrury's Treads instead of your usual boots.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Dengeden","date":"2015-04-17T05:55:00.410+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wait, we're not going to tell him how good {{item:3285}} is on Kat?

On these champs there is no middle ground. you might want to try some other champs that don't need to get fed and snowball hard.\n\n2: Bronze are silver are ranks that you can get by playing ranked. You need to get level 30 and then play ranked games.\n\n3: Katarina and Fiora are good for noobs, some other really good champs for noobs In my opinion: Cho'gath, Caitlyn, Nidalee.

I would say that it is always about playing around your lane. It isn't always about the champion you are playing, but the player you are playing against. As for the negative part, I would suggest always trying to be a positive person, for being positive always leads to more comebacks and your team will usually win alot more.\n\n2.) The tiers like Bronze, Silver, and Gold, belong to Ranked games, where when you hit level 30, you are able to pick a Draft version of champion select, which allows you to ban 3 champs per team. Ranked games are a more competitive version of League, as because you are trying to be on top of everyone. If both of you hit level 30, you and your boyfriend could play together on ranked and climb the ladder together, but i would train alot before doing that.\n\n3.) Fiora and Katarina, are what i call 'Buttonmashers,' (sorry, i am completely bias'd against these 2) where you are able to press 4 buttons and win generally. If you are looking to get the easy way, i would go people like Fiora and Katarina, But if you are looking for more of a challenge, i would suggest some older champions like Anivia and Ashe.\n\n4.) As for pointers, I would suggest that you work on farming when in-lane, because the way you usually win. I learned most of this stuff by watching These guides [Here](https://www.youtube.com/user/unswlolsoc) (They are pretty old, but they are informative.

I think it is best to find champs you enjoy (as Kindlejack suggested with the free week) more than a specific role.  Sure, top and mid are a lot of fun, but it is usually good to find champs you like in other roles because you won't always get top or mid.  In my opinion, once you **can** play the other roles it is fine to specialize, but if you specialize first you might not be able to have as much fun if you get stuck elsewhere.\n\nOn another note, feel free to add me in League.

They're fun to play, trust me, but against more experiences opponents you might have a difficult time, especially if they have stuns or knockups or slows to interrupt your mojo.\n\nFor instance, I often play {{champion:254}} and {{champion:113}}. When I'm against a Katarina, I save one of my cooldowns (most people blow their cc really fast in a teamfight when they're new, which allows Katarina and Fiora to have a field day) during a teamfight and wait for Katarina to shunp and ult my team.
