And when Wolf marks a camp the mark could be a Dark Star.\r\nTheir voice could have them go back in fourth about feeding the Dark Star and protecting the Universe or something related to one of the 2 themes since they kinda cross over with each other.\r\n\r\nI feel like this would be a prefect theme for Kindred and the Cosmic/Dark Star line of skins and I really hope Riot takes this idea into consideration.","replies":[{"poster":"Akali Prime","date":"2019-05-22T00:06:45.283+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"and maybe have a toggle where kindred becomes the dark star and wolf becomes cosmic?","replies":[{"poster":"Asudurga","date":"2019-05-22T00:26:43.433+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Then it would be an Ultimate Skin","replies":[{"poster":"Akali Prime","date":"2019-05-22T05:59:50.354+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"eh not really. just one alternate form is too lack luster for an ultimate skin that'd be worse than GG MF","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wordson1x","date":"2019-05-22T00:59:07.459+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah it would.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Potats","date":"2019-05-21T16:28:46.802+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like this idea a lot!!","replies":[{"poster":"Wordson1x","date":"2019-05-21T16:55:31.771+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Wordson1x","date":"2019-05-28T17:17:26.311+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"One week after I this post Riot shows off new Dark Star skins lol.","replies":[]}]}
