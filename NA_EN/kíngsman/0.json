A friend of mine started playing but I dont see any progress in the xp bar on their profile, even though it shows they did the tutorials.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-08T23:11:31.467+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I believe the tutorials are just entry modes and do not offer XP.  XP should be rewarded through matchmade game modes, like coop vs ai or pvp.  Anything that will put you into a queue.  Let me know if that clears things up!","replies":[{"poster":"Kíngsman","date":"2017-03-11T21:36:43.235+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah that seems to be the case, thanks!","replies":[]}]}]}
