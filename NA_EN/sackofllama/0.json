My friends all use the new client so I tried it. I honestly loved it. Until I went to try to play a game. The client would never let me get into the loading screen and would constantly freeze my pc when I tried to load in the game. SO I reinstalled the old client which has worked like a charm for me all the time. Could Riot PLEASE not take away this old client? I honestly am worried I'm not going to be able to play this game anymore which is a real shame.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-04-18T17:56:34.266+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Everyone will be on the updated client in the coming days, so it's really important to troubleshoot what's causing this to happen.  I have a few ideas on why this freezing might be happening, but we'll need to rule out some possibilities for your specific issue.  \n\nIs the client simply freezing and stuck on champion select, or do you actually get to the loading screen?  What happens if you enable [Low-spec mode](https://i.gyazo.com/a39e12ca76e54359342203c476a0e9c1.png) in your client settings?  Toggle it on, and test it out in a custom game.
