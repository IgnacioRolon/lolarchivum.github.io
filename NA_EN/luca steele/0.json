What do you mean by the screen did not refresh?  Was your screen stuck at champion select?  Did the game load at all, possible with a black screen?  Did you get any error messages, and what did it say?  I've got a few ideas, but a few more details can help a lot!","replies":[{"poster":"Phenyxs","date":"2016-08-07T02:06:00.096+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just posted a similar response for help from riot. I did the Windows update and even went through all the drivers to make sure all and everything us updated and it is. I loaded league, got into a lobby in normal and went through the champion ban and pick and was running smoothly until game loaded on the rift and the project theme started it locked.  Frozen,  couldn't back our nothing. I had to hold the power button down and am rebooting the system.  I ran ccleaner,  my antivirus and malware and everything is current and running smoothly on my system. Now this the second time in 2 days and currently should be in a game and I am not. You gave me a leader yesterday for a game or lobby that never happen. Never got into any lobbies and the messages state error occurred sending information back to server and you are back in your pre made.  Then to 're Que and I get a 5 min sit and never was in a lobby.  Played rest of the night no issues and then first game today this. This is frustration and getting a leaver for nothing isn't fair.  I don't dodge games or lobbies even if I wanted to. I play it out. So looks like there is a issue here and also asking for help and remove the leaver cause you won't find in my history leaving any games.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"xvs23","date":"2016-08-07T00:15:58.437+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"this happens to me all-too-often.  In champ select.  Screen freezes.  Mouse clicks do nothing, but audio continues.   You can hear that you are supposed to select champ, but you can't.  the annoying part is then you get penalized... as-if you dodged during champ select... when it was the software crash that caused you to miss your pick or ban.\n\non windows 10.  super hyper machine.
