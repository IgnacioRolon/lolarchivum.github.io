This is normal when someone gets marked as a leaver since it wouldn't really be appropriate to reward someone for not helping throughout the whole match.","replies":[{"poster":"Prefix","date":"2017-11-07T07:10:27.629+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"That is dumb it means if I dc I should just never come back because I can't get a win.

I am fairly certain that your teammates, who managed to hold out 4v5 for an entire 11 minutes of the early game, would beg to differ. Immaturity just damages your integrity. It frusturates those dealing with it, and makes the person behaving like that look stupid. Try to understand the perspectives/position of the support team, rather than running along arrogantly throwing a temper-tantrums.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
