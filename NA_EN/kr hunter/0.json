Until there are better automated scraping tools I feel like this is just what we have to deal with for the foreseeable future, and that, quite frankly, sucks.\n\nYouTube could do a better job nuking copyright claim trolls, though.

It isn't a takedown notice, they are just controlling the revenue of the video, which is kind of unfair to know that some scammer is getting all the monetization of you work just because he registered a free song. \n\nI checked that Label Midia, and it's some sort of independent label where you upload your music and they take care of the copyrights. So in before someone decides to register ALL League's songs as his, what can we do?","replies":[{"poster":"Carnival Knights","date":"2016-06-03T20:43:33.461+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"We're actively working with YT as we speak.
