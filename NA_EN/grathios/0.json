I live in a place where it costs more to get to the store and buy a league of legends card than it is to pay straight up. I accidentally charged back because I thought it was a different game that I didn't play anymore which im stupid for but I've spent money on this game and I'm willing to spend the money back so I can get unbanned if anyone knows a way to do pay the chargeback fee back to riot with my debit card please let me know.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-12T18:34:42.970+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You'll want to get that go ahead from our Billing team, so they can work with you and get everything fixed up.

Riot, if they're like any other sensible company, is very specific about how chargebacks are handled. They'll be able to give you the information as to how they wish for you to pay it back.","replies":[]}]}
