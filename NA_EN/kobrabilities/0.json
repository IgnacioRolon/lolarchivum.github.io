I hate when teammates intentionally troll or play champs they are brand new to in ranked. Today I have gotten banned for 10 games then 25 games and now im tilted. Please look at my ticket I literally put everything in it. This quinn adc i had on my team was intentionally feeding two games in a row first on my team and i flamed her and then the next game on the opposite team. I dont think I deserve to have a 25 game chat restriction since i have played a ton of games today when i have gotten a good amount of honor but then here and there i say one thing to people and i got banned for 25 games. It all started with a toxic feeding player who is probably completely fine. I have the video saved of her the entire game. Someone please help. I have been way less toxic since my 10 game ban earlier today and now im banned for 25. Id honestly rather get the 2 week ban than have to sit here and not be able to communicate for my team. 25 games x 40 mins = 1000 mins or 16 hours of playing that i cant talk to my team. How is that gonna help the community at all?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-30T01:48:02.625+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the shoutout, but there's not going to be a lot I can do here sadly. I looked over those chat logs, and in the most recent one that got you hit with this 25 game chat restriction, I noticed you called some of your teammates retarded. That could have been what prompted your teammates or possible the enemy team to report you. \n\nTo be a little more real with ya, I can definitely understand how much this can suck to have happened. It sounds and looks like you were really trying to keep your cool in that match and help out your teammates, but that rough match must have gotten to you like they do to all of us sometimes. In the future, if you notice yourself starting to get heated try and remember that after that game, those toxic people will be gone and you can continue playing with more teamwork aligned players. Heck, you could always try what I do when I encounter these people and simply drag the chat box offscreen, that way you don't even have to listen to them. It's much more satisfying to report someone after a game rather than fight back to protect your honor and end up with punishments =\\ .","replies":[{"poster":"Last Bre√†th","date":"2017-08-30T11:19:19.682+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"About the trolls in ranked games, I think it is the reason why I'm worried to start. I will finish my first provisional matches like 3/10 or 4/10, because of  these trolls or I am facing too good enemies for me and I will be placed in bronze 4 or 3. Then I will finish as bronze in the end of the season, but wait... There is coming season 8. That means I will be placed in lower rank than my old, whatever is my score ( even 10/10). So I will be in bronze 5 and what if I face more often trollers? I would try to be nice and put them to the right place and they wont hear me, because I am bronze.  No one will respect me anymore.\nMaybe I'm the reason to not play ranked, because** I'm not good**.\n\nAny thoughts?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kobrabilities","date":"2017-08-30T04:30:11.375+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well thank you, you cant shorten the ban a little bit? its very annoying not being able to ask for help or to let people know im coming or stuff like that. tbh would prefer the 2 week ban","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Killer3000189","date":"2017-08-30T07:00:56.070+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is it really that hard not to flame, like really?
