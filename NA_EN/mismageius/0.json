If talking shit is what makes this game fun for you, either find some friends to talk shit with, or stop playing this game. Not everyone is on the same page here obviously lol. You can talk shit anywhere, why choose this platform? This game is about the game, not socializing. \n\nIve never seen someone get banned for a question mark. And I agree having an inter ruins the game more, which is why the minimum punishment for an inter is straight to a 14 day ban, whereas chat punishments start with measly chat restricts, so I think you actually agree with Riot too. They can punish both. I can see both sides of whether chat violations should be punished or not, but im not really into arguing about personal opinions. I know you think they shouldnt be punishable, and I guess all i can say is good for you for having an opinion I guess? Lol.

My account doesnt even deserve chat restriciton but riot felt it was necessary to take my dangerous gang affiliated self off the streets of the rift. Riot go report yourself\n\n\nHope you learned a lesson from this. When you harass a player in chat and demand everyone ban him two things will happen.\n\n1. Nothing.\n\n2. Riot will review the chat logs. In this case based on your chat above the person reading the chat may well enough decide to ban you. They have the power to do so. In essence, you got yourself banned. Once I had a situation where someone trolled me. They declared ADC but took smite and followed me through the jungle trying to steal my buffs and otherwise being a pest. I lost my temper and cursed at them, something along the lines of fuk off. I demanded my team report them. Guess who got chat restricted?\n\n\nWhile there are some scenarios where Riot will ban a player based on actual game-play (for example I recently got someone banned for obvious boosting) most of the time chat violations will get punished far more quickly.\n\nThe reason is pretty simple. Proving whether someone is actually inting vs having a bad game is pretty difficult. Unless they are playing a Garen with 6 tears of the goddess or something similar you really can't prove Veigar was guilty of anything other than failing at an off-meta lane decision. Your chat log though was indisputable harassment.\n\n\nPoint is, if your going to spam to report a player make sure none of your own conduct in the chat is questionable.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheBillabongKing","date":"2019-10-07T05:41:34.113+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"It's bullshit dude.  I started playing this game s5 and I was an immature and toxic kid and I said the most crazy toxic stuff, granted never seriously.  In the past year I got my original account banned and 2 others banned for stuff 1,000 times worse.  It's a competitive game and I let my teammates know when we need to make important plays I don't have time to be pc and form a polite message I'm never actually said anything rude meaning it.  The problem is league's glory days are over and the game has hired too many idiots.  I don't see why they even include the mute button anymore now that typing anything other than useless troll banter gets you banned.  It's funny the streamers who have continued to play league make it a priority to not use chat, often muting all and restraining themselves from typing, because chat these days is a trap to get banned and the only messages you see are from the same idiot mentality people as the ones who ban the \"toxic players.\"  Unfortunately riot has ruined another originally great feature of the game but at least now we have a terrible voice chat and a bunch of useless weeb emotes for riot to make money off.  Just gotta stay away from chat if you can't quit playing.","replies":[{"poster":"Imperial Pandaa","date":"2019-10-07T06:17:03.897+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You know it's weird.
