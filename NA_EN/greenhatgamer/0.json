I took a second to push the window back on it&#039;s track and taped it up.. and like a completely logical human being, I kept playing.\r\nThinking it&#039;d only last a few moments long because we were losing, I didn&#039;t want to quit. And despite us losing horribly in the beginning, we were able to fight back and win... 45 minutes later.\r\nThe game had lasted a little over an hour, with my arm in the worst pain I&#039;ve been in.\r\nA little after it happened, and I had healed up, I decided to email Riot and tell them my story. Riot Soleil replied and thought the story was awesome. Because of that, I was given this wonderful gift! It&#039;s a hand painted Riven picture, standing in front of an exploding nexus with a window on her back, her arm wrapped up.\r\nThe letter reads &quot;hey summoner, we thought your story was awesome, so we wanted to make you something that would commemorate a window falling on your shoulder! We&#039;re so very happy to hear that the shoulder is healing, and that you&#039;re still able to kick butt on the rift!\r\nBest of luck on the fields of justice!&quot;\r\nthis is by far the best gift I&#039;ve ever gotten from anyone, thank you for making my entire year!\r\n(reposting this from Reddit because the mods are jerks.)","replies":[]}
