If anyone has some sort of solution for this problem, please... do share ;-;","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-12-28T22:33:54.814+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That ping is pretty huge! :(  Are you running on wifi at all?  It could either be a degradation in your network, or even how your ISP is routing to the game server.  A traceroute can help us really know for sure.  Download [WinMTR](http://winmtr.net/winmtr-v0-92-now-available/) and run a route to the game server: 31.186.224.42.  Run it for about 5 minutes, replace the IP address with dashes on the first two rows only, and let me know what you find.","replies":[]}]}
