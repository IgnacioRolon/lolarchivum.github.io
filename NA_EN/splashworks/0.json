I've played plenty of games on losing teams where no one was toxic in the game and we all had fun because everyone tried. Voice chat will not deter people from being toxic. Neither will bringing in a sandbox mode so people will need to \"train\" before they enter a game. You're either a toxic person or you're not. Toxic people hate blaming themselves for their mistakes cause it means they'd actually have to be accountable.\n\nToxic players deserve all the punishments they get. Screw people who try to bring down other people in a game and ruin their enjoyment. Nobody wants to play with them. Those people need to just play single player games or play only with premade 5 teams that are able to tolerate them instead of making the community deal with these shitheads.","replies":[{"poster":"Blackjaxxx","date":"2016-10-30T11:26:33.352+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":47,"body":"\"Why the hell should Riot cater to toxic people?\"\n\"You're either a toxic person or you're not. \"\n\"Toxic players deserve all the punishments they get.\"\n\nAnd that's the problem. Immediately you rush to make the distinction that there are \"toxic people\", as opposed to just \"people\". All you did was just reinforce the \"us vs them\" mentality. Nowhere did I mention that these systems will cater to 'toxic people'. What they will do is prevent people from being toxic in the first place. Not that you'd care to read. Your biases get in the way of rational discourse.\n\n'Toxic people' are not some plague in need of purging. We're all just people, and there are systems that can be established (voice comms) to keep us at our best. Your hateful view of toxicity is what causes the problem in the first place. I mean, just look at your own rhetoric: \"Nobody wants to play with them\", \"Screw them\", \"Those people should just play alone\"... Etc. Who is that going to help? You're the most hateful person in this discussion, for God's sake. Instead of regurgitating this kind of intolerance, how about you try looking at the bigger picture? Punishing 'toxic people' does not make them less toxic. Systems that encourage good behavior and player interaction, do. How is that an irrational thing to say? Oh, right, it's irrational because \"fuck toxic players, they're swine\".

Toxicity is subjective. We could have a long discourse on the properties of objectivity, and then realise that the very notion of objectivity is the subject of subjective speculation on a fair number of philosophers. Am I observing a ball objectively, or is it merely my opinion that the round-shaped object I am observing is a ball (and therefore subjective)?\n\nYour argument that toxicity is subjective is not bad in and of itself, but the broader argument it supports (\"it's therefore difficult to tell what is and is not acceptable\") is less agreeable to me.\n\nThere are a fair number of \"obvious\" societal guidelines which anyone, provided they are not autistic or otherwise mentally impaired, can intuit as to what is acceptable conduct. Very few people would believe that, when meeting with your prospective boss for the first time in a job interview, calling them an \"ugly, fat bitch\" would be a good idea. It seems fairly obvious that it's a poor move.\n\nIn that sense, people can intuit that informing one of your team mates in a team game that you opine their mother is \"a fat whale [you] raped while making [their] father watch\" is a poor choice of action. Although subjective, I predict many people will be able to intuit that this is generally undesirable behaviour, and I predict receiving punishment for the transgression should not surprise a great deal of people─except, of course, the one being punished, since they already made the incorrect judgement that their behaviour was in no way rude or objectionable. (In which case, we could field a discussion on the properties of sociopathy.)\n\nWhat I do agree is hard to judge are the finer instances of 'toxic behaviour'. If your team mate is performing poorly and you inform them that they should think a moment longer before diving once more, this behaviour could be interpreted as \"criticising a team mate\" and \"harassing them\" for making mistakes, but it can also be argued as constructive behaviour designed to improve the likelihood of victory.\n\nThat's unfortunately behaviour heavily subject to context, circumstance and personal experience, and I daresay it'd be impossible to forge a set of rules so encompassing it can take into account these situations. A summative list of \"naughty\" words might be helpful, but consider that the word 'trap' is fairly innocuous... unless used to refer to a transgender woman, in which case it can be downright offensive.\n\nGenerally, though, the people who complain on the boards about the subjectivity of toxic behaviour exhibit behaviours which aren't so fine. \n\nTelling your teammate that he should \"go kill himself\" is much easier to argue as being undesired behaviour. There are very few situations in the world where telling someone to \"go kill yourself\" is considered appropriate behaviour.","replies":[{"poster":"Dominick Destine","date":"2016-10-30T21:06:03.097+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Elphege,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=6uYyvx9n,comment-id=0000000000010000000000000005,timestamp=2016-10-30T20:56:45.673+0000)\n>\n> We could have a long discourse on the properties of objectivity, and then realise that the very notion of objectivity is the subject of subjective speculation\n\n1- No we couldn't, subjectivity and objectivity are very simple and straightforward concepts.\n\n2- Objectivity is not subjective, obviously.\n\n3- Never go full renekton.\n\n>I predict many people will be able to intuit that this is generally undesirable behaviour\n\nDesirable behavior and undesirable behavior are subjective. \n\nThe argument I am making is that Riot should make it exactly clear what is acceptable and what isn't since they are the one that are defining these subjective concepts.
