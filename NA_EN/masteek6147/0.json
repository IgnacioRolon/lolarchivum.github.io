You're not in trouble but I will be disabling further commenting on this thread. \n\nIn regards to you not having received your Riot Kayle skin from this event, I strongly recommend submitting  a [Player Support Ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/requests/new) and letting them know as this is an account-specific problem. They should be able to look at your account history and see what's up.\n\nBest of luck!\n\n~Mod RookDio","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-24T16:33:39.626+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are a lot of accounts to gift and we've extended the gifting period per our current [support banner](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/227317608--Sept-14-Anniversary-gifts-are-currently-being-distributed-You-may-not-receive-them-right-away-so-please-be-patient-).
