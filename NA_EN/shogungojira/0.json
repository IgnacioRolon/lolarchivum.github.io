I bought Shyvana (720 RP) and her Boneclaw Skin (520). This cost me 1240 RP. So I&#039;m down to 1960 RP. I decided I have enough for one more champ with a skin, and decided on Quinn and her Woad Skin. As soon as I buy Quinn, my RP drops to 29. 1960-975 RP does not =29. Where the hell is my other 980 RP points Rito??????? I&#039;m extremely frustrated right now. I should have had enough to get Quinn and her Woad skin. Please fix this.\r\n\r\nI would also like to add, that the three purchases I made, do not even add up to the 2800 I purchased. Only about 2200. So I am out 400 RP. Why is this? How does something like this happen.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-05-29T21:34:58.437+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey ShogunGojira, \n\nSometimes, IP/RP balances display improperly after a purchase.

I've actually freaked out for the same reason before. :P","replies":[{"poster":"KÃ¼rama","date":"2015-05-30T00:32:48.825+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/p/4/005/085/12f/11cf8d9.jpg","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"ShogunGojira","date":"2015-05-29T21:28:09.263+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ok.... Um, nevermind. I went ahead and tried to purchase the Woad Quinn skin, even though my balance tracker said 29, and was able to purchase it anyway. So, I don't need the 975. That was weird.","replies":[]}]}
