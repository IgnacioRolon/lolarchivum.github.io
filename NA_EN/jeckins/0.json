I strongly recommend completing the steps below as a quick check to see if these changes are affecting you.\n\nFirst, I recommend going into your Windows Display settings and ensuring your display resolution is set to what's recommended by Windows. You can find a link on how to do that [here.](http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/4910-screen-resolution-display-change-windows-10-a.html)\n\nSecond, I suggest completing a reset of your config folder, since these settings will be out of sync with your new resolution. Log into League, then delete the *Config* folder in the following directory:\n\n> C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\n\nRestart your client and hop into a custom match to ensure the changes went through. Let me know if those steps worked.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ottiz","date":"2016-10-03T04:12:28.199+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Try this:\n\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/t8xsh6gc-windows-10-anniversary-and-lol-bugsplat","replies":[]}]}
