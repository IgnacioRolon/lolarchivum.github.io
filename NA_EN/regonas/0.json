There slumbers creatures of great and horrifying power. They live in a world of chaos and evil, thus they serve only chaos and evil.\nArchitects of this dark world could be called by many names, but none of them would be true. That world is nothing like our own and we, mortals, shouldn't be a part of it. However, if the times comes when we open ourselves to this dark and hostile world... then all will be lost.\n................\n**Page 93.** There is beings beyond our understanding and they lurk in our fears. They consume our souls, our hope and dreams, and leaves nothing behind. These creatures should never be names and their names should be forever forgotten, because in those names lies power. Such power like our world have never seen before. If someone dared to speak the names of these beings, then they will answer in a worst way possible.\n................\n**Page 165.** Of all dark beings hidden in the world beyond, there is six most evil of them all. They rule their world not by force or by word, but by their unimaginable powers.\n................\n\n**Notes of dead scientist who tried to make an artificial portal to the void**\n1) There is strange magical power leaking into our world. I discovered that it have a strange interaction with dead tissue. The only problem on testing it is the time required to gather enough of this magic.\n\n2) I discovered that this magical power's concentration in the same area is almost always the same, however its amount should be steadily increasing. The only conclusion would be that someone is consuming this magic.\n\n5) Experiment failed. Maybe it is impossible to gather that much of this dark energy into one place without right conditions.\n\n9) Yes, i succeeded in making a small portal into otherworld. It seems it have some kind of life forms in it. Took some samples and then closed my portal. More testing is required to determine type of life forms from that world and if it is possible for humans to live there.\n\n20) What have i done... This, these creatures shouldn't be... That world shouldn't be explored. It should be destroyed. That monster... His voice. Oh god, his evil voice. I still hear him, i still hear him even right now. He is calling, he... That monster. He want me to say his name, but i don't want to. He makes me do thing. He makes... he makes me do things to myself.\n\n21) I am destroying all my life work. It is evil. I... i must be forgotten. No one can know what i did. What... it... no... NOO... it made me do it. I can't live like this. This is my final will and if someone is reading it then please, please... don't do what i did. Don't look in the darkness... Never... Don't say his name... His name...\n\n**Ritual Of Summoning** \nMalzahar with others members of his cult finally managed gathered power required to open the gate to the void so large, that any void creature could come to Runeterra at any time.\nRitual started and sacrifices of living people began. One after anther dead person fell to the ground and void powers grow stronger around ritual site. Soon the most powerful of void creatures could been summoned, but Runeterra wasn't ready to surrender without a fight.\nKassadin and other Preserves managed to interfere with the ritual and stop the gate from fully forming.\nAs cult of the void fled ritual grounds with thoughts of failure a single void creature managed to enter Runeterra. However, because ritual wasn't complete, so this creature was summoned incompletely, so he had to hide and live in the flesh of the dead.\nAs this voidborn was taken with cult, the cult knew nothing about that they summoned, but Malzahar seen a vision of distance future where this being took over Runeterra.\nGol'Dahal, one of the six pillars and creators of they void, also called the voice of the void and the whisperer of the the void was in the hands of the cult. Even in this incomplete form he still is a god to them.\nNow the cult of the void have a new task: find a way to completely summon Gol'Dahal to Runeterra.\n\nStill, as he is incomplete, so his name can be heard only by the voidborn, and only Malzahar had knew what kind of creature he really summoned.\n\n~~ ~~\n_UPDATE (2015-09-24)_\n\n**Champion's QUOTES**\n\nUpon selection\n_I will be complete._\nhttps://soundcloud.com/remigijus-jakutis/complete\n\nMovement\n_This rotting world._\nhttps://soundcloud.com/remigijus-jakutis/rotting\n\n_Do you hear me?_\nhttps://soundcloud.com/remigijus-jakutis/hear\n\n_Only i will survive._\nhttps://soundcloud.com/remigijus-jakutis/survive\n\n~~ ~~\n\nAttacking\n_Take this._\nhttps://soundcloud.com/remigijus-jakutis/take\n\n_Get lost._\nhttps://soundcloud.com/remigijus-jakutis/lost\n\n_Be dead._\nhttps://soundcloud.com/remigijus-jakutis/dead\n\n~~ ~~\n\nJoke\n_I hate turtles._\nhttps://soundcloud.com/remigijus-jakutis/turtles\n\n_Teenage mutant ninja... losers._\nhttps://soundcloud.com/remigijus-jakutis/teenage\n\n~~ ~~\n\nTaunt\n_You will suffer beyond the imagination._\nhttps://soundcloud.com/remigijus-jakutis/suffer\n\n_What is my name?

Void marks can be consumed only by dealing true damage to effected enemy and those marks deals X magic damage when consumed.\n\nNothing odd about his physical damage.

Because he is incompletely summoned he can use his true form only for short amount of time, so to protect it he uses void powers to keep minions alive (torturing their dead bodies and making them move) and hides inside big hulking body until time is right.\n\nDoes that sounds unique?","replies":[{"poster":"Chromatic Eagle","date":"2015-09-23T16:56:06.070+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm just of the opinion that while you have great kit ideas, they may not always flow well together.
