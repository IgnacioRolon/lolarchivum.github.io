And now we are talking about sacrificing AD for CDR. Some goes with R: 3% of AD per sec.\n\nNow, don't forget that this is only two damage dealing abilities. Only 2 out of 4 abilities deal damage, and one is his ulty. So, on average this champ have 70% of AD per ability. What is the problem with that?","replies":[{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2015-11-01T22:28:13.342+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Combined with the new Essence reaver, Deaths Dance, and a couple of crit items you could build the CDR without sacrificing much damage.  \n\nNow you probably know more than me on these scalings.

Everything is calculated, as some people say.\n\nSuppression is like a stun, but you also will not be able to act.\n\nLets compare this champ with Leona and Taric:\n1) This champ can suppress for 1,2 sec. He can't do anything else, but to throw his enemy reducing time of suppression.\n2) Leona can stun for 1,25 sec. During this time she can do whatever she wants.\n3) Taric can stun for 1,6 sec. This is a ranged stun and he still can do whatever he wants.\n\nWhat is better? Hmmm? Stun or suppression?","replies":[{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2015-11-01T22:50:39.044+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fair enough.","replies":[{"poster":"regonas","date":"2015-11-01T22:50:47.702+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Ralanr,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=piOPk9Ja,comment-id=00070000000000000000000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2015-11-01T22:50:39.044+0000)\n>\n> Fair enough.\n\nTold you.","replies":[{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2015-11-01T22:52:57.993+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just voicing my thoughts.
