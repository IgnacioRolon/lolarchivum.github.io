He is born out of dreams of traitors, thieves and liars. He managed to to escape the world of dreams and enter Runeterra through the final dream of dying magician.\n\n_Who he is?_\nHe is dream being. However, because he left dream realm he can&#039;t go back to where he came from. His origin is similar to Nocturne&#039;s, so you could say that they are relatives.\n\n_What do he want?_\nRunetarra is nothing like the dream realm. This new world offers him so much, yet he still misses some of his kind he left in dream realm, so he wishes to open the gate between two world for all dream beings to invade Runeterra.\n\n_Is he evil?_\nNot exactly. He is dream being, so he is without morality or common sense. All he does is normal and perfectly fine to him. He doesn&#039;t know the difference between good and evil, so he is neither. \n\n_Why did he became a champion?_\nHe wants to learn how Nocturne entered Runeterra and do the same for other dream beings.\n\n**Friends:** {{champion:60}} {{champion:56}} {{champion:134}} {{champion:412}} {{champion:90}} \n**Enemies:** {{champion:432}} {{champion:16}} {{champion:236}} {{champion:67}} \n\n~~ ~~\n****\n**COMBAT**\n\n**Attack range:** 155\n\n> **Passive: Dream Eater:** basic attacks on enemies who are suffering from any disable effect will cause 10/15/20/25/30/35 (+2 per level) bonus magic damage and heal you for 50% of damage done by this effect.
