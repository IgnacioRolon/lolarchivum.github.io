Uncounterable burst combo with one of the lowest skill floor ever.\n\n**Soraka:** Huge ass heal with AP. Cancerous and toxic. Starcall is huge and will hit unless you're the type that try to cast it on someone running away at max range. Need ratio and base nerf.\n\n**Swain:** One of the oldest ranged top. Even better in the current \"sustain damage\" meta where he just heals all of them.\n\n**Azir**: Ticking time bomb. 3 items and it's GGWP unless you have an assassin like Fizzuke who can easily jump over his wall or a long range burst mage to counter him. His early isn't even that bad.\n\n**Master Yi**:  The constant nerf to other junglers make him great now. Madstone Yi with AS page will destroy you.\n\n**Gnar**: All the bronzies will say \"LOLUSELESS\". All the people up there will say \"Broken ass laning phase. Build nothing but tank and still deal huge base damage with almost no CD.\" The latters are right.\n\n**Nami**: The shift to the way W works after the support utility change is one of the reason she's so OP. The bounce reduction is a lot lower and with better AP customization, she will CC just as much as you but outsustain and outdamage you.\n\n**New Sion**: Stop missing your ult and learn how to chain CC and you will see just how broken he is.\n\n**Jayce**: Annoying piece of shit who works better now thanks to the assassin nerfs. The constant gated Q is the same thing as Nid spear, just higher CD but if you throw in any extra poke into the team, have fun.\n\n**Rengar**: Unless they rework his concept so that his Empowered spell shares CD with his normal spell, he will never be fine.\n\n**Gankplank**: This one just wants to be here cause Yohoho.\n\nExpecting downvotes because atm, GD is bronziehighfiving paradise.","replies":[]}
