The goal stated was Runes needed to be simpler to obtain and less frustrating to newer and lower tier players. If so along with the Rune update could you create an updated page or a series of videos fully explaining what each in game stat is and how it affects the in game champions. I believe this would help many players from the beginner to even gold know what they are investing much of their IP into and boost overall satisfaction.","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2017-02-16T04:25:51.591+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"We won't be making major changes to runes or masteries mid-season.

I think the best example of this is Vet Scars. Almost every tank in the game runs Runic Armour, it's not even close. I play Sejuani, a champion with very strong synergy with Vet Scars and no synergy with Runic Armour and Vet Scars is still pathetic.","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2017-02-16T05:22:08.802+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Changes to individual masteries are fair game certainly, and not just in mid-season.

It has antisynergy with CotC as well, you bulk up your shield which tends to just get ignored so you gain 2 seconds of bulk but people just ignore it until your 3 seconds of shields drop.\n\nI don't think it's \"underappreciated\", I think it's just worse than Insight, which is actually the strongest mastery in its slot.\n\nTBH though it probably just needs a rework. Burst durability on a tank is kind of just useless.\n\nSame goes for Siege Master, Perseverance, Vet Scars, Unyielding and Legendary Guardian, these are just bad masteries that you pretty much never take.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SlashStriker","date":"2017-02-16T20:31:44.050+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=fFu42c1g,comment-id=000200000000,timestamp=2017-02-16T05:22:08.802+0000)\n>\n> Changes to individual masteries are fair game certainly, and not just in mid-season.
