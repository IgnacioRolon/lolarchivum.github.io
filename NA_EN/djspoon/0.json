I got leaver/remade for 3 matches in a row. I can que by myself but if I que with a friend I get left after champ select with a black screen that says what this is titled. I am getting pretty tired of not being able to play with my friends. I have run the lol repair tool, uninstalled/reinstalled, just to make sure it is not a computer issue. This is network and its on RIOT's end. I play this game to play with friends, if I can't play because of an issue between my ISP which is COX cable, and RIOT. I wont spend anymore money on this game, and I will uninstall. This is incredibly frustrating.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-03-17T01:54:09.498+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's definitely frustrating not being able to play with your friends. Even more frustrating that you're able to solo queue just fine! \n\nSince you've already run the repair tool, let's look through our [Connection Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) so that we can be sure an unstable isn't the culprit. Sometimes your network's connection to our game servers can become spotty, such that you aren't able to stay connected throughout the match.\n\nLet me know how this works out for you!","replies":[{"poster":"djspoon","date":"2017-03-20T22:44:46.549+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was able to resolve the issue on my own by manually updating my DNS settings.
