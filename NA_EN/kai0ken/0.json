I do not deserve to be in it. So if some developer out there could take a sec and somehow free me of this unjustifiable punishment I would really appreciate it.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-09T03:25:08.427+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I believe you're referencing the issue mentioned on the [**Service Status Page**](http://status.leagueoflegends.com/#na).

I feel like i should not have to deal with five 20 min queue delays because of a client bug.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-11T23:45:35.999+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately, a 5-game penalty is not a direct result of the known issue.
