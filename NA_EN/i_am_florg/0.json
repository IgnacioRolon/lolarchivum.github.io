You already have to type their username, what are a few extra letters?   This wouldn't need to apply to adding people after a game, because that is not where the issue comes from.","replies":[{"poster":"Thryale","date":"2015-04-02T20:10:04.558+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":0,"body":"but humans hate captchas just as much as bots...","replies":[{"poster":"I Am Florg","date":"2015-04-02T22:49:13.466+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"I hate having to type my password every time but I understand that it is a necessary sacrifice.

You might see more frequent game botting to level 5 with this solution. Don't you get exp in custom matches?
