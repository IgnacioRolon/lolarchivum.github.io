(Which I believe they've made it to where all PBE testers are aloud to get the Alpha now, not 100% sure though.)\n\nJust be patient bro! It's so worth!\n\nIt's also worth noting that I didn't check my email (that I signed up with) for a very long time and I found it by accidentally searching for League of Legends in my email account. \n\nSo make sure and keep checking and if you ever get on, my PBE name is the same as my Live Client name! \n\nHope to see you on the Beta RIFT!!!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-01T22:08:55.886+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are really unspecified criteria in how PBE testers are chosen. In general, we look for players who are really active and are a positive influence to the community and playing by the [Summoner's Code](http://gameinfo.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/game-info/get-started/summoners-code/). \n\nSometimes we've sent out invites based on what we're testing, so let's say we're looking to release a champion that is super fabulous like Taric. We'd probably send out invites to players who main Taric so they could give us awesome feedback. \n\nFor complete details on the PBE, [check out our FAQ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751904-Public-Beta-Environment-FAQ#top).
