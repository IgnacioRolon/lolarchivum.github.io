But PayPal isn't working for this and I don't know why. Please find a fix to this, I really need to just repay Riot, but I can't due to technical difficulties, please find a way for me. If there would be an easier way if I get unsuspended and just go on and ban my RP buying, besides I just used like 75 dollars, unlike other people who have used 400+","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-12T04:39:24.086+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We have a website setup for our NA players to pay back those chargebacks pretty quickly and easily!

It's referred to as permanent since it will not lift automatically. Certain suspensions remove themselves after a certain amount of time, but this one will be in place until the payment is received.","replies":[{"poster":"PieGe NA","date":"2017-05-15T00:18:31.526+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the reply, I'll pay it as soon as possible. ☝️","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
