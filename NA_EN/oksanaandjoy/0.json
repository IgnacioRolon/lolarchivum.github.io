I had no problem connecting and my ping was normal at that time (I average around 270ms from Cambodia but stable). Now I'm up around the 500ms mark and it is moving all over the place, sometimes down to 300 and at times up into the the 1000's. Nothing else on my network has changed...\n\nAny thoughts?  Anyone experiencing the same?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-14T17:29:32.233+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your ping is already going to be pretty high due to your physical distance from the NA server.  Your ISP may have changed how you're directed to the game servers, but you can use our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to tune things up.  Keep in mind, though, that it's still not going to exceed that physical obstacle.  Still, I hope it helps!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Oksanaandjoy","date":"2017-03-14T16:05:20.860+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So I just downgraded to the legacy client. Ran a quick custom game and the ping is back to my usual 270, though moving around a little bit more than usual but only by +/- 10 ms. Don't have time to test on a full game tonight though. \n\nAnyone else experiencing the same?","replies":[]}]}
