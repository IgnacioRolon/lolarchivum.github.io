The game goes into that laggy state where you can kinda see things moving but not do anything. Second time it wouldn't reconnect so I had to quit the client entirely then restart and reconnect. \r\n\r\nI also noticed that old \"crunchy\" distorted sound problem fairly common on OS X at one point too. Related? Was that fixed? \r\n\r\nCheers.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-11T20:26:36.281+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As far as I know, the \"crunchy\" sound issue was resolved, except for those using special EQ audio enhancing applications, which exacerbate the issue. Can you give me a bit more detail about what happens when your client crashes? Any specific error messages you see when it happens? With a bit more info, I can provide the right steps to resolve this.","replies":[]}]}
