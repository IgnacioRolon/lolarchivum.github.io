I decided to reconnect at a good time (just pushed down top tower). Tried reconnect and then got bugsplatted 3 times once my loading screen hit 100%. Restarted the client and eventually reconnected, but then the game quality was terrible, lots of d/c and lag was worse than ever. \r\n\r\nAny thoughts?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-15T22:41:43.753+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmm there might be a game file somewhere that is damaged, and that damaged file is causing the game to freak out each time it has to use it. Let's try running a quick repair through the client options to make sure all the files are working properly but hit me back if that doesn't help!","replies":[{"poster":"Oksanaandjoy","date":"2017-05-16T12:39:01.186+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I did the repair and the game started. Later on last night and today I was getting errors that \"something went wrong and we can't create a lobby\" or something along those lines. After the repair it worked. Played again tonight. One game was ok though a little laggier than usual. Second game was terrible tried to reconnect again and same result, though only once this time; it connected on the second attempt. Terribly laggy though. Game was unplayable.","replies":[]}]}]}
