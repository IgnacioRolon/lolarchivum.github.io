I'm not here to argue that point. But to be permabanned is no ones favorite thing. Things happen tempers get high and people troll you into tilt mode. This subject I'm sure has been brought up before nor do I think I'm the first to think of it. But why do we not have a permanent chat ban instead of banning the entire account. To me its unethical to permanently ban an account with an auto program over these things. You can take many examples from many games and I chat ban should be instated before you permanently ban an account. I can understand that chat is banned and now you have someone who feeds over pings and just purposely causes teams to lose to be banned after the perm chat ban and that's it. But it's like a step is missing in this system and that's all I'm saying. I'm sure numerous accounts have been permanently banned because someone had broke rift standards and I'm sure numerous accounts got banned for very little to no  Negativity but others in the game teamed up and banned against him I know this happens. So yes I recently have been given a perma ban on my account for similar reasons. I'm not gunna argue whether or not I should have been banned but rather that an 8 year old account with thousands of dollars and time spent on it with very good behavior besides the last couple months to be perma banned and that's it hands down is a lil too far. There has to be another step riot. Please tell me there is a dev that understands and respects this thought and please tell me that riot ignores these things because of the greater dollar. I have never thought of the company like that but at the same time the way the system works is yes spend all this money and time but at any time if things go south your account and everything in it is just data and now it's gone and that's it no rehabilitation. So my opinions my fix to this is to eliminate perma bans for one(this will never happen but should) instead have very long bans maybe season bans or so. Also incorporate not just chat ban which we know you can do but a perma chat ban which if you can do a temporary one I know you can make it permanent for the account. These fixes in my opinion will change the communities opinions on the ban system in riots favor (again my opinion). What I do not like is a default that's it we dont care about you here is a automated system to show this company I have never thought this of riot. Please some dev read this and hear this. I'm sure I'm not the only one who has stated this.

This happens mostly through gameplay infractions since there are no longer chat options available to them. These players usually end up with permanent bans anyways. You receive multiple warnings before you receive a permanent ban. if you are unable to reform prior to that point you have shown you are a negative influence and a negative part of the community and should no longer be a part of it.","replies":[{"poster":"dozeroth","date":"2020-01-21T21:17:07.176+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":8,"body":"First I'm entitled to post here whether it has been posted or not.

In that since it acts as a step and I bet 75 percent who get this will think differently about how they approach the rift. The other 25 may dons you say but their true perma ban is coming then. This perma chat ban STEP will give you that last shot if you are truly toxic it's only a matter of time. Besides that truth be told with so many opinions and the increase of people being offended by others opinions people can be banned for very small amounts of negativity in a game which gives competitive spirit. It's a very hard line to walk sometimes what in one game people find funny and play along with and get no negative thoughts on someone in another game will ban you for.

ALL of those are conscious decisions that are not results  of \"accidentally crossing a line\". \n\nIf you use hate speech, intentionally ruin games by int'ing or griefing then you deserve to have your punishment escalated. Those behaviors are harder to automatically detect though which is why the process is longer. You already get 3 strikes before your banned.

Riot's not gonna give them infinite chances though and they have to put their foot down somewhere. If a player truly values their account then they should think about that before getting permabanned, cause at that point it's too little too late. Do you get infinite chances at a job? Usually no, so why should a game be any different?

Thus in their eyes, they have already written off the toxic player as a paying client.\n\n>From a business standpoint, do they want to remove the toxic guy who has spent $500 but is causing a negative environment for 4-9 other players in every game? Those non-toxics are also spending $500 and probably will spend more, promote the game more when they are enjoying the game AND they won't cause a negative environment.\n\n>I personally think it is a fine argument to protect the ones that are paying money and aren't toxic rather than protecting the ones that may pay the same amount but are toxic.\n\nTo quote [Umbral Regent]( https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/bIQEEAVN-perma-bans?comment=0000): \n\n>If you got your main account permanently banned, the only way you can prove your reform is to not get any further accounts banned.\n\n>Riot isn't going to give you infinite chances, they have to put their foot down somewhere - and that somewhere happens to be after the 14-day ban. If you can't be bothered to listen to three separate warnings _at the very least_, then, why should your main account be given a fourth try?

Unfortunately, it turns out that such players used their few chat opportunities to be toxic, and, when they couldn't be as toxic as they wanted to, they resorted to committing non-chat offenses such as griefing (following someone around and taking their farm, using wall abilities to interfere with their play, etc.) or inting. The purpose of the punishment system is to eliminate rule-breaking, not make it worse. Thus, if a couple chat restrictions don't make any difference in a player's misbehavior, the system ramps up the punishments until the player is permabanned and thus unable to use that account to break any more rules ever again.\n\nAccording to [Riot Tantram](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/wsObUaFj-if-tyler1?comment=00010001000000000000):\n\n> It really breaks down into two categories.\n> \n> 1.) Helping players reform\n> 2.) Shielding others from the behavior, at a cost.\n> \n> We used to issue chat restrictions that essentially scaled indefinitely.\n> \n> We were able to determine that after a certain point the penalty no longer helped with reform. The 10-game and 25-game counts for chat restrictions are based on data that they were both light enough, and felt strict enough to encourage people to understand their behavior is unacceptable in game and change it.\n> \n> We also saw that the players in this 'large restriction' category defaulted to gameplay altering means of harassing their team. It caused an increase in feeding and trolling.\n> \n> The sample size of this population and time frame is huge. Essentially the time spanning from the introduction of chat restrictions to the introduction of IFS.\n> \n> So my question for you is, would you rather have more feeders and less negative chat?","replies":[]},{"poster":"PresBushDid711","date":"2020-01-21T23:04:45.011+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Anyone else find it odd that you were better behaved 8 years ago then you are now?\n\nI would be more concerned with figuring that issue out, and then maybe leveling a new account.","replies":[{"poster":"dozeroth","date":"2020-01-21T23:45:56.278+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"Toxic?","replies":[{"poster":"GatekeeperTDS","date":"2020-01-22T01:20:48.675+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, you were toxic and got permabanned.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PresBushDid711","date":"2020-01-22T23:08:27.135+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=dozeroth,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=eAVu1mN7,comment-id=00040000,timestamp=2020-01-21T23:45:56.278+0000)\n>\n> Toxic?\n\nYou are free to report the post.\nHowever, that still doesn't address the issue that your behavior has worsened despite being almost a decade older.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"fatherdarius","date":"2020-01-22T03:10:13.940+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You know, instead of permanent bans, they could do indefinite bans.\n\nBan until some condition is met.\n\nDon't know that condition would be.\n\nMaybe, level another account to the same level as the indefinitely banned accounts, without any behavior infractions?\n\nI dunno.
