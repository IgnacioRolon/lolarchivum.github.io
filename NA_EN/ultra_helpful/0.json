Please refer to my prior thread\n\nboards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/svTGF7Vy-na-showing-servers-as-west-coast-150-ping\n\nWhen I actually went through the trouble of trace routing my network traffic. While the traffic no longer is being routed through that node, my ping to League and ONLY league is 100-150ms consistently in game.\n\nPings to google.com are 37ms consistently. Even while playing league. Also this problem has been widespread among only Verizon users in the upper east coast for over a week now. No response from Riot. If you would like my logs I will gladly post them for you to have fun with, but I assure you; the problem is NOT on my end.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ultra Helpful","date":"2015-10-08T17:50:53.669+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I guess if no ones talking about it on Reddit Riot doesn't care!","replies":[]},{"poster":"MAC128","date":"2015-10-08T05:37:43.410+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"same here","replies":[]},{"poster":"xPineapplex","date":"2015-10-08T02:07:40.111+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"God don't tell me the problem is still there?
