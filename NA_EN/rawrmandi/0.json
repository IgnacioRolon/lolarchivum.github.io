Now league is unplayable. At best I can get 6 or 7 fps.\r\n\r\nI've done everything I can think of:\r\nRan repair option\r\nUninstalling/reinstalling\r\nCleared out all caches\r\nRemoved all unnecessary programs (there's very little on my pc anyway!)\r\nDefragged\r\nCleaned out system logs\r\nAnd the trusty old turn it off and then on again!\r\n\r\nI did panic that something had gone pop on my PC since it happened all of a sudden, but I'm pretty sure it's an issue with the league client itself since I also run guild wars 2 occasionally and there is no difference in the way that runs. \r\n\r\nJust wondering if anyone else has this or if there's likely to be a patch before season ends since I'm so close to dragging my ass outta bronze for the first time in like 6 years (life keeps getting in the way!).","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-17T20:55:10.358+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This might be an issue with some of the updated game files not working properly with your drivers anymore. Make sure to turn on \"close client during game\" and check for any driver updates following the steps in this [**FPS guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting).","replies":[{"poster":"RawrMandi","date":"2017-10-17T21:46:09.474+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey,\n\nThanks but that's my point. I've done all of that and more. It's not resolving anything and the fps drop has occurred suddenly since 7.20.\n\nAs I said before, I'm certain it's not hardware based because everything else on my pc runs fine and I'm pretty sure it's nothing to do with my system since GW2 runs consistently with the way it did before, and I've done every system/software fix on my system that I can think of.\n\nRunning the repair option and reinstalling have also made no difference. And I've played with the \"close client during game\" on since I upgraded to the new client. And all of my drivers are up to date. (When I said I've done everything I could think of, I meant it! Lol!)\n\nAny help would be appreciated :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"sizzlinnersh","date":"2017-10-26T04:13:53.839+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have a ticket open right now, the support person had me submit my logs after trying a couple of other things so ill update you if i get any results","replies":[]},{"poster":"RawrMandi","date":"2017-10-17T20:17:07.668+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh and of course I've dropped all the graphics options down to those horrible \"very low\" levels and got rid of everything that can affect fps from the game, including investigating options with the client running in background thing.","replies":[]}]}
