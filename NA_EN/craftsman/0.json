For any of the other hextech items (champions/skins) I am not able to highlight or access any option when I click them. I am able to hover my clicker over the item (e.g. morgana champion shard) and see the RP and Blue Essence value to it but it does not allow me to actually click the item and do anything with it.\r\n\r\nI'd like to solve this because I have no way of using hextech right now.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-06-02T22:28:47.777+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This sounds really strange, but it could be due to a connection problem struggling to communicate your fusion (or transactions) to our servers.
