I can hear players typing in lobby and the client's explorer icon is visible in my taskbar but I cannot see anything: just my normal desktop wallpaper. When I click where the client should be a very small part of it appears in the upper left corner of the client but this is it. Whenever I complete a game now I have to restart my client and I don't have any access to the post-game options.","replies":[{"poster":"KÃ¼rama","date":"2017-06-02T00:59:02.169+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Do you have the \"Close Client during game\" option checked in your client settings?","replies":[{"poster":"craftsman","date":"2017-06-02T01:16:12.631+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the option is unchecked\nsomething else that might be related is this: since patch 7.10 my client reverts to the 1024x576 window size when i boot it up and after every game. I change it to 1600x900 after every game  but it always reverts back.\n\nbut now i don't even have access to the client after game.

What's most likely going on here is the client starts back up, but for some reason, the resolution isn't being grabbed correctly from the configuration files so that client isn't able to display properly. \n\nLet's do a little more troubleshooting by resetting your config files to make sure those are all saving correctly.\n\n- Log into the game client\n- Navigate to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config\n- Delete the file  named **game.cfg** and **persistedsettings.json**\n- Go into a custom game and verify that settings have saved properly. \n- Leave game to sync settings\n\nLet me know if that still doesn't help and we can dig a little more!","replies":[{"poster":"Jonython9021","date":"2017-06-19T23:46:40.002+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah that still doenst work i still have the tiny window on the top left","replies":[]},{"poster":"craftsman","date":"2017-06-02T02:39:04.049+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thanks for your reply\nafter following your instructions i noticed that a few of my settings were different. my keybindings were unchanged but vertical sync was turned on, graphics settings were changed, quickbind ui was changed, aa was checked etc. etc.\n\nafter returning the settings to my preference i played through my custom game as tryndamere to see if i could get back to the client upon completion of the game. I had tried doing this earlier with a custom game and experienced the same client problem. This time I was able to return to the client lobby and see that I earned no IP for the custom game etc. etc.\n\nthanks again\n\njust a side note: my client still defaults back to the annoying 1024-576 window so I have to enlarge it in settings after every game.
