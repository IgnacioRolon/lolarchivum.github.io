Just based on what you've said, my assumption is that there are potentially some issues between your bank and our bank which could be causing you to see this error longer than normal.  Usually we just ask players to wait a few days before attempting more purchases for the errors to clear up.\n\nIf you go ahead and submit the ticket now, I imagine we'll be able to honor the sale for you once the error clears up :)  Alternatively, you can look at purchasing RP cards or the like if you don't want to wait the few days.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ThunderCatsUnite","date":"2016-05-05T17:56:41.527+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the purchase rp button is gone on my account to so i think its a problem with them","replies":[{"poster":"Pyke Masta","date":"2016-05-05T18:19:59.297+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This frightens me.\n\nEDIT: Button is back for me what about you?","replies":[]}]}]}
