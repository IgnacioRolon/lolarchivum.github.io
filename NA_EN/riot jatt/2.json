There are some changes to bounties coming to patch 9.6. We’ve noticed some confusion around the bounty system, and we think we can better explain our philosophy and what is actually going on. So, I wanted to start this post with my best effort to explain the system as it currently exists, then I’ll get into what we’re changing, and also why the system exists.\n\n**Bounty Rules (Preseason-Now)**\nSince preseason, four factors have contributed to bounties:\n\n- Base kill gold\nThis is usually 300g but decreases as the target racks up death sprees\n\n- Kill streak gold \n150g at 2 kills, 300g at 3, every kill after that adds +100g (kill streaks are worth roughly 100g per kill overall)\n\n- CS gold (we want large gold advantages from farming to add to your bounty)\nThis one is detail heavy, but the intention is that you will get a bounty if you have SUBSTANTIALLY more farm gold than the enemy team's average since your last death.\nEnemy team average is determined by summing the opponent team monster+minion gold since your last death and dividing by 4 (for the 4 gold streams of top/mid/bot/jungle).\nThere’s a threshold of a +100g advantage before CS bounties start tracking (starts at 50g), and then every additional +150g above the enemy average adds 50g to bounties.\n\n- Global bounty reduction (for teams that are losing)\nThis is a big source of confusion since it’s never been explained clearly. If your TEAM is behind, your kill streak and CS streak bounties are lower. The further behind your TEAM is, the more your bounty decreases. \nThis is a lever that helps allow for comebacks, and makes the cases of “I was just CSing to try and get back in the game” or “I’m 5-0 but the rest of my team is feeding” less punishing. Here’s the formula:\nBeginning at a 3% TEAM gold deficit, bounties are reduced to 80% of their normal values. This scales linearly down to 60% value at an 8% gold deficit, then scales linearly down to a minimum of 20% value at a 24% gold deficit. \n\nNow, let’s see what’s changing in patch 9.6:\n**Updated Bounty Rules (9.6+)**\nCS bounties will be roughly 25% smaller and account for support item gold.\n\n- NERFED :: CS bounties reduced by approximately 25% (50 Bounty per 150g >>> 50 Bounty per 200g)\n- NEW :: CS bounties decrease when you lose your advantage\n- NEW :: Support item gold contributes to bounties\n- TEAM AVERAGE :: Now account for the addition of support item gold and divide CS gold by 4.3 rather than 4. (This and the above line won't have a significant impact on bounty values, but make the system a little more accurate.)\n\nBig CS bounties are most often seen in pro, because pro players naturally put more resources into the ADC. Because of this, ADC minion/monster gold advantage over the enemy team is usually large enough to create a bounty. To put some numbers to it, in patch 9.4, an ADC needed to be 2200 gold ABOVE THE ENEMY AVERAGE in Minion and Monster gold to gain a +700 CS bounty (would display as Bounty + Kill value, usually 1000g). With the patch 9.6 changes, the ADC will need to be 2900 gold ABOVE THE ENEMY AVERAGE to gain a +700 CS bounty.\n\nBounty scoreboard visualization\n\n- BASE VALUE :: Scoreboards and chat no longer include the 300 base kill gold\n- FIRST BLOOD :: First blood gold is no longer added to bounty numbers if it hasn't occurred yet \n\nOn patch 9.6 the scoreboard display for bounties will only be bounty gold, not base kill gold + bounty gold. We think that putting +450g on the scoreboard was actually a mistake, as many players think that death is worth 300 kill gold + another 450g. In reality, it’s just 300 kill gold +150g, and it's debatable whether or not that +150g should even be played around. (For instance, a minion wave at 25 minutes is worth 195 gold.) We think showing  +150g more accurately presents that decision.\n\nIt's also worth noting that First Blood gold was being added, meaning that the first 150g bounty would show up visually as 550g! This is a huge psychological difference. Now it just states 150g.\n\n**Why CS bounties exist**\n\nI want to talk a little bit at the end here about why CS bounties are valuable for the game.\nCS has historically been the BEST way to gain an advantage in League since farming let you build gold leads without triggering anti-snowball mechanics. As a result higher-tier players tend to get more gold through CS and less from taking risks, since going for kills not only carries a high risk of failure, but success adds to your kill bounty. \n\nBut bounties are meant to be a reward for killing powerful or valuable members of the enemy team, not necessarily members with lots of kills. In pro for instance, teams funnel tons of CS into their carries. We think it’s GOOD that the bounty system is more accurately assessing their power.\n\nAs for snowball, some is good. When you do well, you should be rewarded IF you can use that lead to carry. Mess up or get outplayed, opponents should get to mitigate some (but not all) of that snowball because they also deserve to be rewarded for doing well (aka anti-snowball). \n\nWe know from iterations of League that had fewer anti-snowball mechanics, what it looks like when games snowball out of control—the winner of the first teamfight just wins the game.\n\nWith the preseason additions of turret plating and stronger first drakes, we knew the ability for a team to snowball was increasing so we wanted to strengthen the ability for a team to come back from behind too. Adding CS bounties helped counter that higher amount of snowball in the game and has struck a closer balance between kills and farming since both forms of advantage add to your bounty now. That said, they've been aggressively tuned and we absolutely agree there have been cases that felt “off”. 9.6's changes to tuning and in-game representation should help them feel more healthy.\nAnyways, hope this clears up some bounty stuff and why we think CS bounties are good for the game. \n\nLet us know what you think in the comments!\n\n{{champion:112}} ","replies":[{"poster":"Rathar Dashing","date":"2019-03-14T16:07:19.343+0000","up_votes":148,"down_votes":22,"body":"So does this mean you can revert the awful changes to Spellthief's and Coin?","replies":[{"poster":"DartExplosion10","date":"2019-03-14T17:51:16.578+0000","up_votes":20,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Rathar Dashing,realm=NA,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=BQEfgyrs,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2019-03-14T16:07:19.343+0000)\n>\n> So does this mean you can revert the awful changes to Spellthief's and Coin?\n\nDon’t know why this is downvoted, it was an atrocious change","replies":[{"poster":"VolatileAkali","date":"2019-03-15T09:38:00.675+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"What change","replies":[{"poster":"TheBlackArrow","date":"2019-03-15T11:17:31.829+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have to be near an allied member for it to proc the gold bonus, even if you have stacks on the supp item","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Riot Jatt","date":"2019-03-14T16:10:35.448+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Lufty","date":"2019-03-14T16:11:32.994+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot Jatt,realm=NA,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=BQEfgyrs,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2019-03-14T16:10:35.448+0000)\n>\n> {{champion:112}}\n\nIs there a reason kleptomancy gold isn't factored into the bounty system?","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Jatt","date":"2019-03-14T16:16:46.124+0000","up_votes":28,"down_votes":3,"body":"Generally the same reason that GP TF, or Draven don't get larger bounties based on the gold their kit uniquely gives them.

Those who have increased gold as part of their kit I find typically do a lot more in team fights, and as a result have less effective damage in the name of \"balance\". - On that note, having a small bonus of extra gold in the kit can allow their abilities to work as intended without making the abilities of those champs to out damage the assassins themselves.\n\nTo be punished for having extra gold in place of more powerful abilities would completely negate their speciality advantage, leaving them incapable, and therefore pointless to pick.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"FaxMeDarling","date":"2019-03-14T18:59:00.808+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You should consider that Kleptomancy is a rune, so, {{champion:420}} , for example, cant have the GotU damage+heal, or {{champion:81}}  cant have DH, comet (Or whatever you can take instead of klep for {{champion:81}} ) bonus damage\nThey have klep and bonus items, but no bonus rune damage, heal etc.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Spideraxe","date":"2019-03-14T16:12:52.010+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey jatt this is super cool that this is your first post as a designer.

However it was quite long time ago when overall gold in the game was lower and wards were quite expensive - those 100g had insane value.\n\nIt was around s3 -s4 when 2 kill bounty got added, it was like 75g. Also max bounty was still capped at pretty low value. Overall the game was pretty snowbally back then. But even with that, overall gold in the game was lower, ambient gold was lower, turrets would be worth slightly less, supports were still half a champion etc.\n\nConsidering how overall gold in the game is inflated right now, higher bounty makes sense.  Back then you would get like first item completed around 20 mins into game, and you would most likely have only basic boots. Getting even 75g mattered.\n\nRight now people get more gold overall - more ambient gp10, better csing and more gold from minions, turret plates etc. You get to complete first item as fast as 10 mins when you get ahead and often around 15 mins even if you are not doing great. Lower bounty would be something you wouldn't even notice in the grand scheme of things.\n\nThere is argument to be made whenever 2 kill bounty should be a thing. I would argue that 2 kills is already a lot of downtime for your enemy, they should miss couple minion waves and you should be able to get plate advantage. Getting 150g bounty for around 1k difference that should be there seems fair. And tbh, overall level of play went really high over the years. Majority of players, even silver ones, should be capable of pushing their advantage beyond just kill gold.\n\nIn short, bounty should be something noticeable and lower values would not just cut it these days.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Tobykachu","date":"2019-03-14T16:08:24.778+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":17,"body":"I feel as though making support gold factor into this is another step in the wrong direction for player satisfaction and ends up resulting in unnecessarily making the best Spellthiefs supports, such as Brand, Bard and Vel'Koz worth more gold for no other reason than they were able to make better use of their support items.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Jatt","date":"2019-03-14T18:01:33.901+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":2,"body":"It will basically be impossible for supports to get CS bounties.

Not that we can always fault them for stomping down some of these changes, but hey.\n\nAs far as problems with implementations, the simplest way is to tie Exhaust to the support role. Possibly, letting income items serve the same way jungle items do and give variants to how Exhaust functions would alleviate most problems with this on the gameplay/variety end. It curbstomps the all-in Ignite supports who might need buffs down the line, but most people don't use exhaust out of botlane. Even so, it's no different from people once in a blue moon taking smite on non-junglers.\n\nKeeping strict limitations on income items to prevent minion/monster farming will still be needed. Ideally, finding more skill-reliant alternatives to the current methods would be good, but can wait.\n\n*Also, speaking of locking support items to the role, i really just meant income items. As far as i'm concerned support items should cost more, and be worth their increased costs (aka match laner's item prices. Goes hand in hand with increasing income so that someone doesn't pop a full Ardent Censer by 12-15 minutes.). The main issue that stems from that can be taken care of with anti-stacking fixes.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2019-03-14T16:14:44.752+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":5,"body":"Super pleased to see these changes and this explanation.

But no one is suggesting an _alternative_ for their change on the items. I agree with everyone about the massive gold decrease to supports due to the changes, especially on poke heavy champions who spend a long time in lane alone, like Sona, Nami, or even Janna. Instead of complaining about bringing the _old_ trinkets back, why not suggest a new idea to try allowing for these items to retain their power?\n\nMy proposal, since _NO ONE_ is suggesting it, is to add in a secondary time to the items. For the next 25 seconds that you are alone (IE _after_ an ally has left lane) you can proc their gold generation effect. Must be near an ally for 30 seconds.\n\n25 seconds is plenty of time to allow AP supports to quickly generate their charges then pull back while the ADC returns to lane, while still retaining the current anti-frostmancy meta. And in advance, one may ask 'but what if the jungler camps top lane, and funnels charges into that?' In that instance we're looking at XP funneling on the ones doing it, decrease map control by junglers, decreased gold generation for the top/mid laner _and_ jungler, and overall punish this kind of playstyle by preventing junglers from simply camping a lane that shouldn't need it.\n\nThe upside that it would also provide is this: If the top/mid takes a support item to their lane, they have to pick that item instead of their standard lane item. However! It incentives intermittent ganking and more map pressure across all lanes by allowing people to generate gold through these items in longer fights. If top needs camped, the jungler will be up there for more than 30 seconds, meaning the jungler can CS, the top laner can focus on harass, and thus it promotes pushing out your lane and allows for recovery that isn't dramatically punished. The same goes for mid lane in this instance. It allows some chance to counteract gank heavy situations, and helps prevent your entire team from getting behind due to the jungler needing to be focused on a single lane that is losing extremely hard.\n\nThere's a lot of fringe cases in which the upside is _too_ strong, and the downside is _too_ negative, but that's the nature of the game. Promoting healthier _Teamwork_ across all levels of play is better for game health, than simply applying a bandaid patch work of nerfs and buffs, complaints and praises for changes that have already happened, and no one suggesting _new_ ideas to try and fix them. The changes happened. They're done, over with. We've seen the previous situation, and it's changed. So going back to it isn't going to _fix_ anything, but rather simply re-apply the same issues that already existed. Suggesting _new_ ideas will allow for change, and if those ideas aren't working, or have too many flaws, suggest _newer_ ones.\n\nEvolve _with_ the game, people.

Suddenly 2 or 3 of your feeding teammates have bounties on them, not because they are doing well at all, but because they have last hit some minions, you shoot up from 450g to 1000g and the enemy team has no problem taking all that gold back in just a few minutes because the reality is you are still the only one fed and can't be everywhere at once. What have I really gained by getting 1k of bounty if my feeding team is worth 1k more as a result?\n\nBasically, their needs to be a more accurate way to decide who is winning, or this new bounty system actually makes the game even more snowbally for the already winning team if a comeback is even attempted. 3% gold difference is a very poor indicator.","replies":[]},{"poster":"buggirlexpres","date":"2019-03-14T20:18:57.497+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hello... since you are changing the reason why support items got hotfixed, can you revert the changes to the support items?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Crush","date":"2019-03-14T17:25:17.867+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":2,"body":"Will you be reverting the ally range limit on support gold items?  I feel like I am not rewarded for playing aggressively early on in the game unless my adc is right next to me.

I think the problem was you left off the base 300gp, so it looked off. In my opinion, it's actually far better to show the 550gp for a bounty+first blood, because that's what you actually get for killing them! Just also show 400gp for the other champs, so it's properly contextualized.\n\nIMO, in an ideal world, the scoreboard would show the money to kill, and then on hover, a breakdown of where that money comes from.

Why not have bounties accumulate based on the gold difference to your counterpart on the other team. If I am top lane and I have a gold advantage over the enemy top laner I should get a bounty. \n\nI should NOT get a bounty if I died, farmed, but have not yet gained a gold advantage over my opponent. Snowballing snowballs itself. That is to say, getting a gold advantage makes it more likely that I will get an even greater gold lead. You don't need to throw bounties on players at a gold disadvantage, it is like double dipping the snowball. I kill you so I get kill gold, you're dead so you are not farming until you respawn, AND you had a bounty so now my gold advantage is a few hundred better than it would have been otherwise. \n\n\nI can understand that systems like this are in place to encourage players to play better, but do not forget that playing better on its own rewards you with more wins.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vekkna","date":"2019-03-14T17:50:15.118+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":">But bounties are meant to be a reward for killing powerful or valuable members of the enemy team, not necessarily members with lots of kills. In pro for instance, teams funnel tons of CS into their carries. We think it’s GOOD that the bounty system is more accurately assessing their power.\n\nThen why not just assign a player's kill value based on their total income from all sources, where kill value is Base x %deviation from game-wide average?\n\nAssume a game has average income of 10,000 gold, but a carry has 15,000 gold and a support has 5,000 gold. You would get 150% of base kill gold for killing the carry but only 50% of base for killing the support. The result is that the lowest-income champs are always worth the least gold, and the highest-income champs are always worth more. \n\nIs there anything that the current system fixes more effectively and clearly than what I just described? What I'm describing here is a bounty system that actually provides anti-snowball functionality in a way that is always proportionate to the advantage or disadvantage of any player on either team. None of this nonsense where a team is getting crushed, but the losing team's assassin gives up 800g because a poorly-designed system doesn't distinguish between killing sprees and winning the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Demon Subduer","date":"2019-03-14T16:29:37.496+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Where is the bounty system for 3v3.
