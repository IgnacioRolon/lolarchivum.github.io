Now all of sudden today I get a steady 94 ping. It is super delayed and its not fun to play with at all. I have the same ping on all other games I play but on League i get a steady 94 ping. I know it's not on my end because it only started happening today and I restarted my router/pc. Like I said, I've been getting the same steady ping for 3-4 years and now all of sudden today I get a steady 94 ping. (ITS ONLY ON LEAGUE OF LEGENDS). I really want it back to normals so I can play with no issues..\n\nISP: At&amp;t, Indiana\n\nSincerely,\nPhil\n\n\nUPDATE: ITS FIXED OMG YES!

Everything looks good as you leave your network, but starts to run into some trouble as soon  the connection hits the ISP.  To be fair, the ping isn't necessarily that bad but if it's higher than what you're used to then it may be worth reaching out to your ISP.  \n\nI suggest starting off with the steps in our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to help, specifically the DNS steps to see if you can do some route changes.  \n\nOtherwise, I suggest requesting to speak with a tier 2 agent who can review this log and check out why those nodes are causing an increase.  I hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Das Heiland","date":"2017-03-01T19:33:04.243+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also having the same issue with ATT, located in Ohio.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Dominatrix","date":"2017-03-01T18:45:01.346+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same problem here and I have AT&T too","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-01T18:46:53.224+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Run a traceroute as well so we can continue reviewing these specific cases.","replies":[{"poster":"The Dominatrix","date":"2017-03-02T02:19:22.732+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is after running test for 5 mins ping is 88 in game but use to be 54\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                      WinMTR statistics                                   |\n|                       Host              -   %  | Sent | Recv | Best | Avrg | Wrst | Last |\n|------------------------------------------------|------|------|------|------|------|------|\n|                  dsldevice.attlocal.net -    0 |  381 |  381 |    1 |   10 |  227 |    3 |\n|99-110-236-3.lightspeed.tukrga.sbcglobal.net -   53 |  123 |   58 |   19 |   28 |  182 |   20 |\n|                          76.201.208.208 -    0 |  381 |  381 |   21 |   32 |  192 |   23 |\n|                            12.83.82.173 -    0 |  381 |  381 |   21 |   33 |  243 |   23 |\n|                   ggr1.attga.ip.att.net -    1 |  377 |  376 |   22 |   33 |  235 |   23 |\n|                           206.121.10.38 -    0 |  381 |  381 |   21 |   28 |  219 |   22 |\n|                          104.160.135.35 -    0 |  381 |  381 |   21 |   31 |  254 |   23 |\n|          ae32-br02.chi01.riotdirect.net -    0 |  381 |  381 |   35 |   46 |  261 |   37 |\n|           ae1-br01.chi01.riotdirect.net -    0 |  381 |  381 |   35 |   45 |  245 |   36 |\n|                           104.160.131.1 -    0 |  381 |  381 |   36 |   46 |  244 |   38 |\n|________________________________________________|______|______|______|______|______|______|\n   WinMTR v0.92 GPL V2 by Appnor MSP - Fully Managed Hosting & Cloud Provider","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"QuiverMeTimbers","date":"2017-03-02T00:22:59.899+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"please tell me you have tried the most basic solutions like disabling windows defender, and plugging into you modem with an ethernet cable. maybe disable antivirus if you have that active as well. \n\ni do however know exactly what you are going through and have similar DNS errors. a radical solution is wiping your computer with the refresh tool and reinstalling everything.\n\ni have no clue what ports LoL uses but these solutions might clear up any issues on your side of things.\n\nworthwhile questions:  did you change to the new client or are you still using legacy? does the new client use different ports than the previous?","replies":[{"poster":"Shocked","date":"2017-03-02T01:20:30.294+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This issue is happening to everyone that is using at&t.
