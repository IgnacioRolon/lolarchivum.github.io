So, she didn't perceive the time passing because she can't perceive something that doesn't exist in that plane.  She just randomly remembered, \"Oh, I don't live here, do I?  I should probably go back to Bandle City...\"  Then, whoops, she's been gone like two or three hundred years...  I imagine it was kinda like how you say to yourself, \"I'm gonna play for like an hour or two,\" and then look at the clock and realize that it's been like eight...\n\nShe's a kid at heart in the sense that she's kinda insane and has no idea how to act \"properly\" and instead just does whatever she wants because WHIMSY!!!!!!~!  And in the sense that she wasn't socialized \"properly\" so she's a clean slate as far as societal norms and expectations go.  I think, physically speaking, she's an adult.  Like, it never specifies her age when she went into the Glade or how long she was out before she went the the Institute of War.
