More Info down below.\r\n\r\nFor both Support and Jungler you must play meta champs. 15 years or older and mature (not being hyper and obnoxious). What we are looking for in a Jungler, ganking w/ asking (when a lane is asking for help you are doing something wrong and saying AFK Farming is not a good excuse because RIP Devourer), for a support you will have to speak with the ADC on the champs but mainly Fresh, Morgana, Soraka, and any other CC champion. If you are good support and we will know because he will get a lot of kills (he will also successfully get first blood if you are a good support).","replies":[{"poster":"Sheolraver","date":"2016-05-10T19:27:35.413+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"\"(he will also successfully get first blood if you are a good support).\" \n\nA joke?","replies":[]},{"poster":"ˉLord Headassˉ","date":"2016-05-11T00:44:40.232+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ign: 404 HP Not Found\n\nAge:16\n\nRole: Support \n\nChampions: {{champion:267}} {{champion:16}} {{champion:37}} {{champion:89}} {{champion:117}} {{champion:40}} {{champion:25}} {{champion:143}} {{champion:43}}\n\nI am more focused on peel for my adc then anything.

Depending on how far ahead or behind we are, usually also affects how aggressive or passive I am overall. Depends on the others as well, not just myself.","replies":[]},{"poster":"OP SadLife","date":"2016-05-10T19:36:08.804+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"IGN: LilPeeWizzle\nAge: 18 as of this saturday\nRole: I main Support\nChampion Pool: I Main Thresh \"NickNamed - SadLife\" {{champion:412}} {{champion:53}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:16}} {{champion:25}} {{champion:12}} {{champion:40}} {{champion:44}} {{champion:37}} {{champion:111}} \nAlso the thing about first blood, I see myself as a Great Thresh and i will get him a level 2 first blood with ignite easily unless the lanes a counter for us then it may take a level or two longer     http://www.lolking.net/summoner/na/56742305#profile\ni was silver the reset put me at Bronze 5 now im just having time off of work to play and get to silver again.\n\n\n\nhttp://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=lilpeewizzle\n\nalso look there if you want to see my games where i mostly go over 30 assist","replies":[]},{"poster":"loogie","date":"2016-05-10T19:24:57.020+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"IGN: loogie\nAge: 19\nRole: I queue Support primary, Jungle secondary in soloq so \nChamps with Support: Thresh, Nami, Braum, Alistar, Soraka \nChamps with Jungle: Kindred, Gragas, Elise, Rengar, Lee Sin\nNote for Champs: if a specific champ is needed for a certain comp, I usually have a learning curve of 1-2 days in which I can be ready to play that champ at a comprehensive level.","replies":[]},{"poster":"9tt2","date":"2016-05-10T19:23:51.221+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sup Main, not a smurf but add me if you at least want to try out a couple games.
