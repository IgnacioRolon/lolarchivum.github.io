Basically what happens is at some point my game will fps for a brief second and then I can not left click anything anymore.  Not only that, but my champ will go into like an auto select mode where it sticks to anything I right click and won&#039;t disable the lock until after that specific thing is eliminated.  This doesn&#039;t happen every game, but the only way to fix is it to relog. I have noticed that normally when I right click and move the cursor shows green when I click as I move.  When the bug occurs the cursor goes red only.  I have gotten a lot of leaver buster warning for this and it is kind of annoying. Any suggested fixes?","replies":[{"poster":"lm OId Greg","date":"2015-04-24T00:44:01.073+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am having a similar issue. My left click goes out intermittently, maybe 1 in 5 clicks will actually be read. My camera will not lock at all, nor can I just move my mouse to the top of the screen to move it, I have to left click on the map to change views. And the left click isn't working. Making it nearly impossible to move. All mac issues are havin some problems. =/ Would say it is every 3 games. Makes me useless.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Juggernaut628","date":"2015-04-23T04:33:26.740+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have it too, but far worse. It happens 2-3 times EVERY GAME every other day, so I've been forced to play hide and see until it is fixed. I just wish that Riot would respond to these posts since I do have one with someone else if you click show more like 2 or 3 times and nobody ever comments on it. I would like to be able to be useful again instead of losing multiple ranked games due to a Mac-User bug. The thing is though, while playing on my smurf this doesn't happen, just this account.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Excluse","date":"2015-04-23T01:28:42.475+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've had this issue intermittently (every 15-20 games or so) and it just essentially lost me a ranked game.\n\nFor me it happens to both my left and right clicks.\nAll of a sudden my click cursor, which is usually green where I click, turns red and I am unable to control my champion.\nIt is not due to lag as the rest of the game, animations etc. continue fine. I am just unable to control my champ.\n\nI am also a Mac user.","replies":[]},{"poster":"helpfulolguys","date":"2015-04-22T15:47:41.977+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think most Mac users has it.
