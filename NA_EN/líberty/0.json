A lot of players run League on Linux with the assistance of [**PlayOnLinux**](https://www.playonlinux.com/en/) or [**Wine**](https://www.winehq.org/). It's unlikely this will be an easy install, but those communities would be the best to reach out to for further assistance or advice when attempting to install the new client on your machine.\n\nBest of luck. \nhttp://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/tux-226x250.png","replies":[{"poster":"toyeturtle","date":"2016-11-16T22:35:40.590+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Penguin Skins + Client for GNU/Linux can be awesome...\n\ni'm one player like other but i NEVER got help from riot for play.\n\ni feel bad about this and i'm not joking","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Líberty","date":"2016-11-15T06:39:04.458+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alright, thank you.
