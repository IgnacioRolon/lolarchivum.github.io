There would be instances such as where I would ult elise in her spider form where she has 3-4 spiderlings around her, yet the ult just dissipates after the first contact with elise. It&#039;s gotten to the point where i&#039;m noticing this occur about one-third of the time that I use brand ult and it has become enough of a nuisance to lead to lost fights and spoiled games. \r\n\r\nThis bug with his ult disappearing has occurred with several other champions that were clearly in the middle of a creepwave or next to a teammate.","replies":[{"poster":"Touch My Box","date":"2016-04-03T16:41:37.794+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, I get the same shit.\n\n\n\nAlthough the biggest problem I am having with Brand is his Pyroclasm's Blaze clause doesn't seem to be working. \n\n\nUse R on an burning champ and it still seems to bounce to minions 90% of the time.
