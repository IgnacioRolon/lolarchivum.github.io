It ALWAYS occurs around the 1:30-2 minute mark and never again for the rest of the game. When it happens my champion finishes the last given command (i.e. walks to wherever I last clicked) and then just stops. From there none of my commands work and nothing responds however I can still see everything happening (Usually the enemy laner or jungle creep autoing me to death). After maybe 20 seconds (And by then I'm already dead) the game fully freezes and I get the reconnecting status and then I reconnect after another 10 seconds. This problem is seriously detrimental to my play when I completely lose control of the early game after giving up first blood or losing CS. If anybody has a fix or solution to this it would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!\r\nEDIT: I am certain it is not my internet connection as music that I'm listening to or Skype calls to friends never disconnects and it is only League that DCs","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-06T00:18:14.154+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like your connection is degrading over time until it loses comms with the game server entirely.  Even though your music or other connections seem okay, it doesn't mean you can't have issues reaching specific servers.  You should run through each step of the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to tune up your connection to the game server.
