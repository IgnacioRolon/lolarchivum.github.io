The community is terrible, this game went from half decent to garbage real quick. Hah no wonder a lot of the pro kids are quitting this year. They know this games going to bomb soon. Not only that but the newest patch totally made comebacks impossible. Get ahead early you have a huge advantage. If anyone has any new games that are worth a go please let me know! Most of the kids I play with also feel the same way. All looking for a new game.","replies":[{"poster":"Ictus","date":"2014-12-21T22:37:49.073+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"if you arent satisfied with league there are many other mobas out there.  already made.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ezz412","date":"2014-12-21T22:55:20.680+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"There aren't any good mobas out there.. I've played them all. Why else do people put up with all the crap from riot? No I meant pros are leaving because of balancing issues IMO. Every patch this game is more bugged. They haven't fixed things that have been bugging from 3 patches ago. Most of my friends have already quit. I'm getting pretty close.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ramix The Red","date":"2014-12-22T02:09:30.546+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know that making this thread is comparable to social suicide, but I'm glad it was made, I've had lots of problems with Riot recently and have been considering leaving.\n\nBut the problem is that while Valve may be a better company, League is a better game.\n\nThe struggles.","replies":[]},{"poster":"EffectFX","date":"2014-12-22T00:16:05.213+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because there exists a game that doesn't have server problems occasionally.

Honestly Dota 2 is pretty decent. But its not as balanced as league. Its an overall harder game.. I appreciate that aspect of it, but its just not as balanced like I said. If league would only focus less on disciplining people, and more on the over all quality of there game IE: server crashing, lag spikes, champ glitches. I just HATE how they ignore the real problems and fix everything that isn't broken.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SnackieCakes","date":"2014-12-21T22:59:24.368+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bloodline Champions was the best, but it never grew enough to sustain itself.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GG Beers","date":"2014-12-21T22:39:36.958+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeah good point, pros are leaving because of bad servers, genius, never thought of that.
