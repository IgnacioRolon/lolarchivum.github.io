Game should just rank you on your MMR or your average MMR over the past X games. But they want a grind system in place hence the need for lp. I don't even play more than 10 or so ranked games a season since it's frustrating having to beat gold 1 opponents to get myself promoted to silver 2.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2016-09-09T17:16:49.709+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I smurf for lower Qtimes. oh well.","replies":[]},{"poster":"XinZhao2WinNhao","date":"2016-09-09T16:47:02.632+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not for 1 account in ranked per person, but I hate it when people intentionally smurf in bronze 5.","replies":[]}]}
