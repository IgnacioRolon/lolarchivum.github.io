Education is always good though. It usually comes down to a mix of hard work, experience, talent, and passion.

Love seeing Riot respond to crap that doesn't matter instead of having the balls to respond to the countless and popular threads about things like Tank Ekko, and how god awful stupid the whole thing is.  \n\nGood job.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"bloodmoth","date":"2016-05-12T02:54:54.791+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"+1 from me too. its one of the few login themes i have just listened to just for the music itself, sometimes play it on my bus ride to uni, bravo","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"1000angrybees","date":"2016-05-09T01:29:02.828+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Taliyah's theme is so absolutely on point that from the first five seconds i immediately thought 'yep this is her, and it's gonna be good.'\n\nAlso it's got such a good vibe to it.
