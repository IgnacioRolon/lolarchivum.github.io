We always compose with sample libraries first and then decide if we need live elements. A lot of it depends on how well we're able to create a realistic sound with samples and if we have time to have a recording session. The Snowdown 2015 track that you linked to was entirely computer generated.","replies":[{"poster":"Flying Buntcake","date":"2015-12-07T02:34:44.967+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Coolio. Do you guys always have a team writing the score and making the finished product for every piece? ( like in the frequencies documentary?)

But, with anything related to the arts, a portfolio is very important when applying for jobs. So in this instance, your portfolio would consist of anything you have ever worked on related to music composition (scores would be good to show) or music performance (recording or video). I'm not a music major myself, but that is what I've experienced in having to build my portfolio. This is just my conjectures.","replies":[{"poster":"Flying Buntcake","date":"2015-12-07T04:00:13.308+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That makes sense :) thanks","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Decrit","date":"2015-12-07T08:46:02.130+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In case you were wondering why the sax\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezRrrdboWLc","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"PaladinNO","date":"2015-12-07T07:19:59.609+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\nThe Making of Freljord Music \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1kdc_9L6Sk\n\nLeague of Legends Cinematic: A New Dawn - Behind the Scenes\n_Sound part at 03:36_\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q40IfQbYlSw","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sharjo","date":"2015-12-06T17:12:33.487+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Depends on what they're making, but I suggest watching this: \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bQBmAO0hk4\n\nGives a lot of insight in to how Riot goes about making music.
