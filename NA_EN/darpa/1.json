People are going to still strategically dodge but now its going to effect their off roles. I am sure you are aware of that but the problem is over a course of time those off roles are going to be so far behind its going to present a few problems.\n\n\nThe main problem it is going to present is that people are going to be less will to play those off roles meaning longer waiting for weaker roles and poorer quality in matchmaking.\n\nLets say a person was Diamond 3 in last season and season reset took him and all his roles down to Plat 3. Now lets say his main roll is Mid and off lane is Top. Whats going to end up happening is his main role mid will hit diamond again while his top may also hit it will a couple tiers behind while the other 3 lanes will fall from all the dodging and neglect to gold or even lower over the course of the of the game. This means he won't ever be autofilled in his division but instead much lower divisions ruining the quality of those games.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Leetri","date":"2019-02-13T17:02:08.586+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's that way so you can't just dodge games until you get a game for your main role.

(as y'know, league didn't have for over 6 fucking years without a problem) \n\nYeah, no.  RIOT has tried to use that as a cop-out excuse, but its frankly entirely bullshit.

I already play a bunch of 4v5s due to someone having to autofilling support on my team, feeding the first kill or two cause they dont play the role, then leave the game. \n\nRight now we're already being flexible with picking 2 roles. Give em 3, heck even 4. But to stick someone in a role they're not competitive with and have their competitive ranking be affected by it is nuts. Imagine if you were in the olympics for track and field, and they stuck you in some swimming matches, and have that affect your final score ranking for track and field. If one role is severely under represented, that's a Riot problem, not a player problem.\n\nAlternatively make the dodge time longer. If that person is that disgusted with the role they'll sit out the timer. I'd rather have them out of my game than in them anyway.\n\nANOTHER option would be to pop an autofill queue notification. If people are willing to do it they'll fill, if not they wait longer. If you're giving people the option to autofill and they don't take it, then they can't complain to Riot about long queue times since they're willing to wait.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Saianna","date":"2019-02-14T19:02:48.751+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Yeah, no.
