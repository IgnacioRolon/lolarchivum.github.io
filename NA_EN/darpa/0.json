I do agree with you, her silver bolts have the ability to proc every 2 hits instead of 3 with rageblade, so that's 14% of the targets minimum hp as true damage every 2 hits, combine this with the fact that last whisper now gives you an additional 20% armor Penn, your looking at around 11.2% of the target's health every 2 auto attacks. And thats without her ult, which at rank one gives you as much attack damage as a B.F sword(that being +40 attack damage) and at max rank ult it gives her more attack damage than an infinity edge which is +70 attack damage and 20% crit, and this item costs 3800 and is one of the most expensive items in the game.

It's 14% per W, and with Rageblade that's happening every 2 hits, so 28% every 4 autos (assuming it was pre-stacked, too). So that's a little over 14, not 11. Also note that you're complaining about getting killed after taking autos in the double digits while most carries nowadays will just instantly kill you before you can even react.","replies":[{"poster":"Quáx","date":"2019-02-07T15:14:34.994+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Her silver bolts do 14% of the targets minimum hp as true damage every 3 auto attacks, but rageblade allows you to do proc your silver bolts every 2 auto attacks, so his numbers are pretty correct.","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-02-07T20:28:39.512+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=EvilRubberDucky,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=7AZhuevO,comment-id=0000000000000000,timestamp=2019-02-07T15:14:34.994+0000)\n>\n> Her silver bolts do 14% of the targets minimum hp as true damage every 3 auto attacks, but rageblade allows you to do proc your silver bolts every 2 auto attacks, so his numbers are pretty correct.\n\nNo, they're not. It's 14% every 3 without Rageblade or 14% every 2 with Rageblade, the latter of which would be 28% every 4 if you wanted two procs of damage. 28% every 3 hits isn't a thing.

Those ideal conditions include: attacker having 2.5 attack speed (not happening until really late into the game and extremely heavy investment into AS), defender not having Cold Steel passive (which you should have when playing a tank into Vayne as it's the only item effect that \"counters' her W), and attacker being able to fire those 11 autos completely uninterrupted; meaning that they don't move between autos and that they don't get CC'd and/or blown up while just standing there in a single spot (admittedly, easier on Vayne due to Tumble). Also, in this specific scenario, there is another condition to be fulfilled; Vayne attacking something 6 times right before engaging on a champion.\n\nIf THE tank-killer champion can't kill a tank in more than 10 attacks spread over 4.5 seconds, an eternity in this game, under several perfectly ideal circumstances (of which you'd be lucky to have two fulfilled in a game versus decent opponents) then that tank-killer sucks at their job.\n\nAlso mind that Rageblade is an expensive item with lots of wasted stats; Vayne does not benefit from AP or Magic Penetration, and if she opts into a Last Whisper item then that's another passive wasted. If Vayne gets ahead then she should be properly rewarded for that, but if you put her behind she can't get Rageblade without putting herself even more behind.","replies":[{"poster":"Accursêd","date":"2019-02-09T00:31:52.190+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"the problem with vaynes case specifically is that she can build ridiculous tank items that will allow her to shred everyone while not being in danger of being bursted, and she has invis and a dash every 1 second that prevents her from being killed by dps\n\nbtw if someone who goes rageblade buys last whisper thats a reportable offense for griefing (satire)","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"5050BS","date":"2019-02-09T00:44:03.860+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Get rid of Rageblade all together.
