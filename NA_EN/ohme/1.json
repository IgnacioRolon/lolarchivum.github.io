You'll only get a free win when you lose your promos and make it back into the series. You recently promoted to Silver 3, so this first time in your promos won't give you a free win.","replies":[{"poster":"OHMe","date":"2017-07-31T22:34:54.879+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was in Silver 2 a month or two ago and dropped down to Silver 5 playing with friends; so far every time I've gotten to promotions I've got the notification and the free win, since I've been in Silver 2 division before I got the notification again, but the win disappeared after I played my next game. the promo helper pop did come up. \n\nMaybe I'm mistaken but I know I was almost to promo's for Silver 1 earlier this season and thought I'd get the free win every time up to promos for S1 (since I didn't win those); maybe I didn't understand the promo helper all the way.","replies":[]}]}]}
