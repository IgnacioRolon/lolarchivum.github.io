Another issue could actually be a result of a connection issue that's unable to download assets from the store.  I recommend downloading our [hextech repair tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367) to help configure some of your settings like your firewall to make sure that a connection can be allowed.  I also suggest using our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to help get this fixed up and get you access back to the store.  Hopefully, that'll get you squared away!","replies":[]}]}
