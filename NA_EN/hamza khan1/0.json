That being said, Japan's ruler was an emperor considering Japan was a coalition of various states ruled by their own rulers. Kings are by birthright while Emperors come through conquering various states/countries outside of their domain (e.g, Alexander the Great).","replies":[{"poster":"Darrosh Jewfist","date":"2015-07-15T22:26:50.633+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What? \n\nWe definitely have hereditary Imperial titles in the world.

Alexander fits the definition. The king of England was also an Emperor as he ruled over the various kingdoms such as Northumbria, Wessex, etc. Each of these kingdoms were ruled by their own monarchs.
