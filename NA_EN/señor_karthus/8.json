If you can dominate early, you are going to have even more advantage (and worse as soon as the new minions mechanics are live).\r\nJust pick a lane bully and don&#039;t worry about late game. Most games end up in stomps.","replies":[{"poster":"iTziLLiRL","date":"2015-11-12T18:09:45.262+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":19,"body":"A lot of people forget.. that those stronger minions can actually be a defenders advantage. It opens the enemy up to ganks if he still wants CS(Since the minions are stronger and more durable to enemy minions they will NATURALLY push) the farther away the enemy is from their turret the easier it is to gank, as a jungle main in plat 1(So close to diamond) I am going to fucking love this patch playing my AD champs I Fckn yolo it with naut attack speed, probably put life steal on that bitch. Jungle role is more important than ever and opportunities are left and right you just have to see it. You have to also adapt your build more so than ever. if you playing ahri and you want to build expensive ludens, and expensive rabadons, and expensive void, etc etc.. and you're 0/5/1 cuz you playing hyper aggressive and its NOT paying off and you're NOT adapting notice the part where I say ADAPTING well.. it's not the patches fault. that you lost both your towers in 10 minutes.","replies":[{"poster":"Señor Karthus","date":"2015-11-12T18:26:28.999+0000","up_votes":23,"down_votes":0,"body":"And you forget that having all your lanes pushed means the enemy team controls the map, can wards and farm in your jungle, can get objectives like dragon and baron, and can split push whatever other lane you are not defending because the minion waves got to another. \nAll that is far more important than the little cs they might miss.","replies":[{"poster":"iTziLLiRL","date":"2015-11-12T18:36:14.394+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":5,"body":"I play a jungler, and I Love ganking. if you want to talk about counter play, did you know if you put a ward down before the enemy puts a ward down, and they go to roam but they didn't have a ward to see your ward, they have no idea if you saw them or not, element of surprise. If someone is pushing heavy like that though you can gank them. Im not sure if you play jungle often but an enemy pushing is your best friend something in your brain should ignite a flaming fucking fire 100000 feet tall in your mind,  and you should gank them. cuz tis pretty much  a free kill if you know the basics of the champ you jungling on. The more you play this patch you will see a different side to it, i was on your team before... but you will see a different side eventually","replies":[{"poster":"Mayor Stubbs","date":"2015-11-12T21:41:09.433+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I would like to add in the case of your own lanes being pushed: in addition to opening more opportunities for you as a jungler to gank, it also (generally) promotes safer gameplay for your team.

Only struggles against Graves and Jinx. Other than that, you set.\nEven trist can hold her own, not that well against Graves, again, but still does pretty freaking good.\n\nKog Maw is really struggling in the early game. Only seen one game head into late phase, and Kog was powerful.\n\nAnd early game casters are now irrelevant. No longer viable at all. Late game casters, also unviable since games rarely take as long XD.\n\nSeems Cait is now busted. Pretty damn useless. Before PreSeason 6 she was great early on. Now she can barely deal damage with headshots, and Graves can just laugh it off by taking the least damage for a marksmen. And tanky supps also laugh it off barely being phased.\nShe is now more than ever lost in with her identity. At one point she was late game carry, then  early to mid, then what is she now? Still not so great any point in the match? ^_^ I get what i am supposed to do with the traps, but she is no where near as productive and viable as before (and before, she wasn't all that viable if not, just barely viable XD)\n\nLiterally, all i got to do is Spam Graves, Yasuo, Vayne, Draaaven, and Quinn and i'm set. But that's no fun =(\nPreSeason 5 was full of unbalanced champs, server issues, bugs, and other mess, but i actually had more fun. More champs seemed more viable, and things seemed more fun.
