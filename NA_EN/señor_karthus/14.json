At max rank, it has 4% mana scaling, so he needs 165/0.04 = 4125 mana to match.\n\nW: 300x0.4 = 120. 120/0.025 = 4800 mana.\n\nE: 1st proc, 300x0.3 = 90. 90/0.02 = 4500 mana.\nBounces: 300x15 = 45. 45/0.01 = 4500 mana.\n\nUlt no mana scaling.\n\nThus in order to do the same amount of damage that he would do with 600 AP, a Ryze with 300 AP would need at least 4125 mana more than the base Ryze.\n\nHow much damage does a respectable build path give?\n{{item:3027}} (650) + {{item:3040}} (1000) + {{item:3800}} (300) + {{item:3110}} (400) + {{item:3042}} (1000) = 3350 mana. So even when making some bad item choices, his damage still doesn't scale as hard with Mana as it does with AP. Just to throw out how this build gives Ryze, its 0.03x(3350 + 1277) + 60 +80 = 278.8 AP.\n\nMeanwhile a build like: {{item:3027}} + {{item:3040}} + {{item:3089}} + {{item:3135}} + {{item:3157}} gives 1.3x(0.03x(1277 + 1650) + 120 + 70 +  120 +80 +60) = 699.1 AP, which is over 400 AP more than the mana build.
