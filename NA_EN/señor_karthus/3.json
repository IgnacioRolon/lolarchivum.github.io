It was an exclusive and didn&#039;t get the best reviews in the world but I absolutely loved it because of its lore.\r\nThe synopsis of the game was that a superior timeless being called The Eternal Champion was watching the end of mankind in a far distant future. He looked in the river of time for outstanding people whose lives could have changed the world for better forever, but they died before they could have accomplished anything. \r\nThe Eternal Champion used all his power to cheat time and abduct these people from different moments in history right before they would die and brought them to his time. But since time was such a powerful force, the Eternal Champion only had power to bring one of them a few seconds before their death. So he created a tournament in which only the winner could be brought back that way, with the knowledge of the things to come to avoid death and change and save the world from its fate. The rest would be placed back where they were and face the death they were supposed to face.\r\nI was completely in love with this concept and loved to beat the game just to know how every character influenced history and changed the world for good. Even if it sometimes didn&#039;t make much sense that every one of them was a martial arts fighter, it made a lot of sense the motivations of them all to participate in the tournament. THEIR LIVES WERE AT STAKE! And they could do things to save the world from its doomed history!\r\n\r\nBut when coming to League of Legends, where Champions are summoned to fight in it.... it doesn&#039;t make any sense for most Champions. It doesn&#039;t make sense because most of them shouldn&#039;t have any motivation at all to participate in it. Many have cool stories and all but then... Why the hell are they actually in the League? \r\nI&#039;m sorry but for me this is the biggest flaw of the lore in this game and why I don&#039;t really care much about the lore. Other than Draven and a few more that actually have motivations to participate, the rest makes no sense.","replies":[{"poster":"Sharjo","date":"2015-11-16T19:01:55.034+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":3,"body":"Well you'll be happy to know there isn't a League of Legends or Institute of War in the lore any longer!

I rented the game from my local video store, a week at a time and despite being a bit terrible at fighting games, I completed both of their campaigns to find out their stories.   I remember reading the instruction manual on the bus home from the store, learning about their (always very tragic) backstories.  I think it was the first time I ever saw a character with the name Xavier - and I was overwhelmed with how downright _cool_ that was.\n\nI do think, however, that it was simply a variation on the standard Street Fighter/Mortal Kombat collect-mighty-heroes-for-a-tournament setup that fighting games are well known for.  The added narrative sugar that it was their only chance at cheating their own deaths definitely added to it - but does make you wonder what 'happened' once the tournament was over.  You and I saw the cut-scenes at the end (or was it text - it's been so long my brain has turned it into a cut-scene memory) but it makes no story sense to then go back to the start of the tournament and begin again.  Having a story with an end - where the characters finally get what they always wanted - is a difficult thing to make sense in a game where you can play it over and over again.\n\nIt'd be really weird, for example, to have a text box pop up at the end of every Victory scene, explaining how your champion overcame their primary character conflict.  It'd get really tiresome too, after the first few times.\n\nThe old 'Institute of War' was an attempt to solve that problem - summon immortal versions of champions to fight proxy battles over any dispute - but it came with its own (well discussed and sometimes controversial) problems.  For better or worse we're not doing the Institute of War paradigm any more - and champions have been getting updated and expanded stories explaining their place in the Runeterra universe without an IoW.\n\nI'm sure someone else may come along and suggest it, but if you're looking for match-influenced story, then the player-run Factions games might help scratch that itch.  Otherwise, occasionally events have taken player actions and used them to influence a storyline junction - but those are few and far between.  More likely, updated biographies and champion stories will show the development of characters in the world - which sometimes bleeds into the game world (as when Gangplank presumed dead in the recent Burning Tides event - and disabled from play until his return).\n\nI feel I may not have addressed your thoughts properly, so I'll end with a question - how would you change League to better satisfy the desire that Eternal Champions created?  What would be your chosen solution?","replies":[{"poster":"Xulsigae","date":"2015-11-17T05:18:23.154+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"For any faults the IoW had, it certainly helped make League stand out in terms of story. Having a reason for gold, items, champion interactions, summoner spells and such along with the Journal of Justice helped create a stronger sense of immersion. We weren't just players, we were members of something. Not everything we did mattered, but it helped to feel like we were interacting with characters and the world through their quotes and such.  We were able to read about champions and their lives in little stories that helped flesh out the world without needing to be massive events. Letters to the JoJ were fun. The Noxus versus Ionia event helped show that players (some at least) could influence Lore to some degree. I know that the choices were limited and the interactions were little better than an illusion, but it felt different than most other games.\n\nI know you didn't make the decision Bio, but...the main reason the IoW had 'controversial problems' from what I saw was that those who were in charge of the Lore didn't actually know their own lore.

Instead, they've decided not to do that for reasons that still baffle me and many others.\n\nI mean, we were told that the new bios wouldn't need to be tied to champion reworks, releases and special events... yet, that's _exactly_ what's been happening.  Bilgewater and Shadow & Fortune, along with Fiora's rework, gave us ten new bios out of the 128 champions (including Illaoi).  At this pace, we'll be waiting 15 years or so (with new champ releases) before this project is close to done.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Xulsigae","date":"2015-11-17T08:02:37.512+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah no worries.

Wait! Imagine a scenario where there is a sort of overarching plot to the game - in addition to the individual champion lore. \n\nthat, the \"summoners\" can choose a faction they represent. and as a community, we compete representing our faction,and at the end of a certain event each year that occurs before (or after) the professional season, the faction whos representatives have performed the best change the outcome of a conflict based around the \"summoners\" lore. \n\nand then the champions themselves, their lore is all about who they are, and why they are a \"champion\" from their world. maybe most of the champions are from the same lore or a linked lore to the summoners --- but some champions could be \"grabbed from their universe\" just because they are something special that we summoners bring to the table of our battle. \n\nand the tie in between the champions and their lore, and the summoners and \"our\" lore, is something along that line. that somehow we pull them or maybe create doppelgangers of them,  or something, because they are impressive heroes. I guess this plays into the issues of the IoW tho does it?

The winning fighter got a second chance at life; a second chance to save the world.  Obviously, if they intended a sequel, then something would be found to have gone wrong, creating new conflict, but I don't believe there was an Eternal Champion 2.\n\nNow, in Burning Tides, Sarah seemed to get what she always wanted - but it didn't satisfy her.  She's still driven to find the body of Gangplank, and to wipe out anyone who may have sided with him.  That (in my personal opinion - you may have another view) was Miss Fortune 'getting what she wanted' but the character developed to have new desires - just as a good character should.\n\nMy initial point was that in a one-and-done game, you can have a 'happily ever after' - but finding new goals for a character after every game of League is pretty much impossible.  There's a dissonance between the player's goals: get better at the game, crush my enemies, go up the ranks, place more wards than the opposing support (that's my goal), get a pentakill, have fun with my friends, etc.  And with the champion goals, which may be as varied as: play music, unite my people, scare the living bejezus out of my victims, follow the scouts code, or herald the machine age.\n\ntl;dr - I agree with you entirely - and the result of that creates problems for a game that is played many many times, over and over.","replies":[{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2015-11-17T18:01:55.591+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Might I reccomend hiring the people that made Dawngate?

We are allegedly already in a different universe than 2 seasons ago. \n\nI am somewhat familiar with working on games featuring parallel universes, but there are some downsides that I'm not sure you cover - specifically, if everything _can_ happen, then nothing _has_ happened.\n\nEverything I do in the game now, while meaningful within the context of that individual match, loses all meaning when viewed outwith that match.  As far as every other match is concerned - and indeed, as far as every other player is concerned - it may as well never happened.  It is, to give myself flashbacks to a certain pair of ginger haired, English-accented, fictional scientists - existing in a state of quantum uncertainty.  \"He doesn't row.\"\n\nNow you can certainly take the player as the 'fixed point of reference' for the story of any particular game - and most games accidentally do this.  When I play through a game like Fallout 4, I'm having a different experience to that which you are having - both equally valid interpretations of the story.  Maybe I've got a female avatar who looks a bit like Janelle Monae - maybe you've decided to make a male avatar that's the spitting image of Hank from King of the Hill.  Maybe you sided with the Institute, and maybe I didn't.  Maybe I placed my crafting station in Sanctuary - maybe you can't be bothered with the settlement system at all!  All perfectly valid ways to experience the story - and to each of us, a full narrative experience.\n\nBut Fallout is perhaps not the best comparison.  Would we still feel like we'd had a satisfying experience if we played Fallout from beginning to end 10 times?  A hundred?  A thousand?  Or would it all start to seem like the story hardly mattered on our nine hundred and ninety ninth play through?  \n\nPerhaps a better comparison would be something like FTL - a roguelike to be sure, but one that encourages replay hundreds of play throughs.  Roguelikes usually forgo much of what is considered 'traditional' narrative - instead providing you with awesome player-narratives, with a thin veneer of setting to start you off.  I'm fairly sure that no-one is particularly satisfied with the story in FTL on their second completion - instead, they are super satisfied at the player game play choices that lead them there.  Missiles or drones?  Engi crew-members or Rockmen?  Tried to save that slave ship, or not?\n\nNow one could argue that the player-narrative side of League is already fairly well covered.  Games have (the good ones, at least) a beginning (laning), middle (teamfights), and end (base fight).  Those 'stories' are ones that I at least come back for every game - a test of skill against the game, myself, and my opponents - one that I can have great influence upon and that has meaning for me.  It's different every time.\n\nI'm getting a bit carried away now (my apologies for anyone slogging through this) but my basic point is that - League provides a pretty good mechanism for player-narratives that have meaning to players, but the frequent repetition puts traditional-narrative in a difficult place.  We could, of course, treat each game as it's own universe, but does it then still matter?  If it can have no influence on other games, or the characters in the future - was it simply a tree that fell in the forest with no-one to hear?  A quantum event with no observer to collapse it?  \n\nLastly, could you not already decide that this was your head-canon, treat all fan fiction as alternative universe truths, and carry on with the game as is?  What would be the difference?","replies":[{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2015-11-17T19:21:21.004+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can't really compare roguelikes to MOBAs.

Like comparing War and Peace to The Hunger Games.  They're both well known, sure - but Dwarf Fortress is the inaccessible monster of a thing that can change your gaming life foreever, whereas most rogue-likes are shorter, throw-away things that are fun to experience and definitely have their fans, but probably won't consume your life and make people look at you like you've grown a spare head.  My metaphor got away from me there.  Even then - surely Adventure Mode is more like most rogue-likes, rather than Fortress Mode.\n\nCompare, instead, to one of the new wave rogue-likes, like Rogue Legacy, FTL, or Binding of Isaac.  A playthrough of these games is measured more in minutes (rather than days for a succession game of DF), and the range of things that can meaningly happen is reasonably broad, but given excitement and depth due to their interactions.\n\nThe player narrative of a game of League ususally isn't formed strictly from things like \"And then Ezreal died and waited for a while\".  It's more likely to be comprised of \"And then Ezreal tried to flash under the tower - but I totally knew he was going to do that, and our jungler Shaco (who was waiting in a swept brush nearby) got in behind him, Sona hit with the ult and he danced and wept while chain CC'd and died.  Bait totally worked, gold for everyone, and Shaco /laugh'ed at their now terrified support.  Unfortunately - they took the opportunity to take Rift Herald, so...\"  It is the player perspective that brings context.\n\nNow, I'm not saying that that is enough - I'm simply saying that player-narrative is different from story-narrative, and that League does have the player-narrative side pretty sorted.  It's the story-narrative side that's disconnected/not present.\n\nHuh, I just realized there may well be people in the thread unfamiliar with the term player-narrative.  If you're an old hat with these terms, feel free to stop reading now :)\n\n------\n\n**Player-narrative** is the story that you make yourself as you are playing the game.  Football has a player-narrative (the highs and lows of the game, and the relationships and rivalries of the players, etc.) as does chess and other story-narrative-free games.  People generally love playing games like Fallout or GTA for the player-narrative that comes out of them - as you will know if you listen to the players of these games tell you about the insane things that happened to them, that wasn't part of the actual plot.  Epic jumps, awesomely hilarious Raider deaths, how you built your car-collection/settlement etc.\n\n**Story-narrative** is what we usually call story - the events that happen in the game world to the characters.  Movies and novels are almost exclusively story-narrative instead of player-narrative.  (I say almost, because how a book will affect one reader, compared to another, can be different - if I read a book about life in '90s Scotland, that would have different meaning to someone who hadn't experienced it.)  Many games have bad story-narrative, because the industry is still going through the growing pains of working out what it means to be interactive with a story-narrative.  Lots of exciting work is being done here - from Facade, to interactive fiction (IF), to things like Left 4 Dead.  Not solved though.\n\nThe much maligned (and hilarious) term '**ludo-narrative dissonance**' is a fancy term that describes what happens when those two types of narrative conflict.  I.e. the story says you're a loving father trying to save his daughter during the zombie apocalypse, but the gameplay has you riding a little red tricycle while wearing a traffic cone for a hat instead of collecting medicine.  Beware, though - using the term ludo-narrative dissonance can get you laughed at in the wrong crowd.  It's just too fancy for its own good!","replies":[{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2015-11-17T19:58:27.598+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Does anyone actually do that?\n\nI mean, not to begrudge you or anything, but 'player narrative' sounds, to me, significantly more like 'highlight reel' or 'something to put on reddit'.

But it's what players experience as they're playing, and comprises the multitudes of little 'stories' that happen every time they play a game.  I realize that it may not sound like what we usually call a story, but it is a real thing (so much as anything is).\n\nI could tell you for hours the stories I've made/lived in Dwarf Fortress, Minecraft, games of League, or games of Civilization - and yet none of those have a 'story' as we're used to describing.  They are experiences - with highs and lows, causes and effects, characters and conflicts.  Just because it doesn't have a writer to tell it, doesn't mean it doesn't matter to me, and that it wasn't a story that I took part in.\n\nPlease note, though - I'm not saying player-narrative is better than story-narrative.  It's not!  They're both good and should be used in the appropriate places at the appropriate times.  Some players love one more than the other, and that's totally cool.  I can understand your position that it's not real story - the [discussion rages on in the particularly talkative corners of the internet for this sort of thing](http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/121701/Analysis_These_Are_Our_Stories__Player_Narrative_In_Games.php), but I find it a useful term.","replies":[{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2015-11-17T20:17:23.735+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I guess I'm just having trouble understanding the concept.

Many people experience different works in a different way, like finding a favourite character or starting to make guesses over the plot, and some stories might develop differently due to interaction, like in the case of Fallout 4.\n\nPlayer-narrative is what we could call an anecdote, only that is not necessarily narrated. Basically a sequence of actions can bring you a particular experience that is worth remembering. For example playing 5 Rammus in OFA and being like \"OMG it' s so fun to stomp these noobs by chain taunting them under the turret!\". It' s something that is born in the moment and can hardly be fully replicated by telling to someone, but has his value because it' s something totally unexpectable, which depended mostly to your own actions.\n\nI am not sure 100%, but should be something like this.","replies":[{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2015-11-17T20:51:22.867+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is that really narrative?\n\nIt just seems like 'something cool that happened.'","replies":[{"poster":"Decrit","date":"2015-11-17T21:02:46.964+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Exactly - it' s that!

What would be your chosen solution?\n\nI would honestly bring back the IoW but with a different setting (and perhaps a different name). It always appeared problematic to me how differently power _scaled_ between characters in the lore. I'll use the recent Harrowing story as an example.\n\nMiss Fortune was thrown against Hecarim. Miss Fortune had expended her resources, tactics and allies, and was about to die with no respawns. Plot twist, she got saved by Illaoi.\n\nThis still implies that Hecarim would have killed Miss Fortune, and also implies that due to the massive difference in power, there is no space in which some characters can meet some others and not get annihilated. Fast example on the spot; Any mortal without magic (Graves and Darius come to mind) versus Kindred.\n\nThe part that clashes unavoidably with the lore, no matter how you put it, is the game itself. Now why in the burning Carebears would Lucian be fighting alongside Thresh, Sion, Zed and Mordekaiser? No matter how you try to present that, it demolishes the lore without a context in which champions can all fight each other randomly, which is exactly what the IoW was.\n\nLet's say once a character 'enters' the League (after being invited/tested), the character himself only creates a replica of himself which the gods of the world (us/summoners) can use to play toy soldiers with. The character then leaves and goes back to Bilgewater to get killed by Thresh. It's somewhat like entering the pantheon (no homo) of the champions of the world. The (us/gods/summoners) then broadcast those random matches featuring random champions with equalized power against each other for entertainment to the world of runeterra as the pseudo Football championships of Runeterra. (Because let's face it, i'm pretty sure those Ionians sometimes get bored meditating and want to watch e-sports too.)\n\nAs lore, it could look like this; the prime god of Runeterra, Rito, has therefore decided that matches would be shorter, and thus tweaked all things in the League to make it so. There was a rather loud outcry of protest among the countless minor gods (that's us normal people by the way), but the more powerful gods quickly adapted, maintaining their influence and power in the pantheon(that would be the pro-players).\n\nThis lets you do so many things! It lets you actually kill champions (Graves is already a bit old, and eventually Kindred WILL come and say hello!), because the timeline is potentially irrelevant to the league as long as champions have been entered. It lets you justify skins (granted some gods might be more pervy than some others). It lets you break the time/universe barrier and jump to the age of Project and Battlecast and Mecha, while still retaining the same League of Legends if you so wish.\n\n-------------------------------\n\nThat said I want two things from Rito. I want the short story of when Graves got his new gun after Burning Tides and he realized that this time it was an actual shotgun! Seriously, it follows previous lore, and it follows his rework. Do it Rito.\n\nAnd i want Rafen, MF's first mate, to be recognized as a champion and put into the game. The guy survived FIVE harrowings.

We fix one of the things deemed problematic with the game at the moment (the lack of player-Summoner connection) but we're still left with games/matches that have no meaning to the world.  You are, as you describe it, playing with simulacra of the champions, balanced so as to be 'fair' against each other on the fields of battle (by the flawed, but well meaning, 'Rito').\n\n> ...This lets you do so many things! It lets you actually kill champions (Graves is already a bit old, and eventually Kindred WILL come and say hello!), because the timeline is potentially irrelevant to the league as long as champions have been entered...\n\nJust so.  We're back to the world of Runeterra being irrelevant to the game, just so long as each champ has somehow been magic-3d-scanned into the summoner's database.  Even then, there are some champs which it seems a stretch to imagine they'd volunteer for such a process (even though there are yet other champs who, without an updated bio, seem to strain believably in their very existence without the IoW - hello Jax/Orianna/etc.)\n\nI can understand if at this point, your opinion is \"Well, it's better than nothing!\" but I'm not sure it addresses the issues that Fenrir Epsylon is having in the original post.\n\n> That said I want two things from Rito.

For me that kind of games find a sense in the fact that, every time you start a new game, is a completely different Universe. Just like League, I like to think that every one of the billion games that have ever been played was a unique and never repeated event for that Universe.\nAs with Eternal Champion, if you beat the game with Xavier, you would know how he avoided being burned at the stake and changed the world thanks to his knowledge on alchemy that helped the human race and turned them into a healthy, equal and non violent species. But if you start over and beat it with another Champion, you would be playing a parallel universe in which it is not Xavier who is granted a chance, but another one. \n\nI like to think the same for League. Obviously I wouldn't like to read a whole text when a Champion wins, but how cool would it be if in the stats screen, instead of the picture of the skin you played with, there was a picture that would show a sneak peek of what that Champion would have accomplished by winning? \nA picture can say many things. A Champion becoming king. Draven surrounded by all he desired. Ekko finally saving his friend... Etc. \n\nThere could be many reasons why the characters of this game could want to win the battle that we play in League of Legends. I just feel that there is no solid concept of what the battle they are fighting is even, and why they are fighting in it at all (not all Champions, but many of them). \n\nI don't feel that the fact that there are many variations of that battle every time a player plays the game goes against the lore. As I said, every game is a different universe where things happened differently. I don't think that ever influenced or stopped the lore in any game ever. \n\nPS: The classic Eternal Champion had a text describing what happened when you beat (or lose) the game.
