He doesn't look like he is gonna push that fast if left alone and he certainly wont keep up with her if she starts roaming. I mean you said it yourself MIA is only effective if people take notice and react accordingly and lets be real, who ever does. I just don't see how that match up would be that bad, if you know you can't kill him don't waste time just look for opportunites else where since its not like your leaving a nasus, jax, or trynd by themselves.","replies":[{"poster":"Señor Karthus","date":"2015-11-22T03:25:26.199+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"You are unranked.

He's not the fastest, but he's probably decent (I don't do it enough to know for certain. But I'm speculating based on how fast towers melt this pre-season. I had a game where a kennen and taric backdoored 2 lane towers, an inhib, and both nexus towers, AND the nexus, in the time it took us to finish a teamfight and push a couple towers mid. Of course, nobody responded to stop them in time because HOW THE HECK DOES A KENNEN/TARIC COMBO DO THAT???!!!
