When I had tried to do so however, the client crashed. As I relogged in, I saw that I now had a Viridian Kayle permanent in my inventory instead, but I also had the skin unlocked. I assume that this occured because of a glitch. I'm asking because I want to use it in a reroll but I'm not sure if it should even be there or not. Am I allowed to use it or not?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-12-10T00:09:59.418+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, it looks like a specialist reached out yesterday in your ticket.
