If you can't because you simply do not care about ranking up which in return leads to the inevitable mindset of attempting to win a game through tilt, then you are just putting yourself and your teammates' morale at a very low standard.\n\nMy advice: Don't play ranked if you are mentally incapable of not using your emotions to influence the game that can lead to a negative impact on both your team and the enemy team.","replies":[{"poster":"Worst Kench NA","date":"2017-02-16T19:39:07.396+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=im actually bad,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=vmTKcTEb,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2017-02-16T10:13:16.462+0000)\n>\n> Shortest answer, yes.\n> Short answer: If you are trying to win but fail miserably and are entitled to be called &#x27;trash&#x27;, accept it as a state of compliment and use it to improve.

I do have games that cause me to go on tilt and play worse than I usually do, but that's something that's not unique to someone in my position. I've never thought \"well, my toplaner is spamming pings on my corpse, I guess I better run down mid the entire rest of the game\".\n\nI've just stopped trying to fight whether I can control ranking up or not. I try to win every game, but if that doesn't happen I don't really care about what happens to my rank. I don't have goals of ever reaching silver and gold. I just enjoy playing ranked because of the slightly more competitive atmosphere, and desire to do better than I usually do to help my team along.","replies":[{"poster":"im actually bad","date":"2017-02-16T21:46:21.779+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Discipline, self-control of emotions and mindsets.\n\nAll three things that are used when dealing with tilt. Never has one been there without the other.\nYou simply won't understand that fact unless you muster the true meaning of those words.\n\nYou want to win, but to win you must know what steps need to be taken to perform that action.\nWhen in doubt the case is the inevitable tilt from your teammates or the sheer toxicity of your toplaner, and you believe there is no hope for improvement, you must begin adapting to a new mindset.\n\nYou see, when we play ranked, most of us have the mindset of \"I want to climb at a steady pace to reach my seasonal goal.\"\nThe problem with that is it's not a clear path. There are always objections and certain obstacles that you must trespass in order to move onto the next step. But that's simply not possible if one does not control what he thinks when being engaged with scenarios that disrupt the pace of the \"I want to climb to my goal\" mindset.\n\nThat's where the idea of \"I don't play to win, I play to improve.\" comes into place.\nAlthough the goal is a major standalone point for improvement, you will simply not have the same luck as other players.\nHow do you except to win every game in a competitive atmosphere when other players are not on the same level as you? Or do not follow the same mindset as you?\n\nThe desire to stop climbing because of unwillingly being put outside of your comfort zone is just one of the side effects of having a bad mindset. Others include toxicity, lack of communication skills and general inability to apprehend your inner ego.\n\nMy advice? Adapt to the virtual environment you are faced into playing with, and learn to control the emotions that garner the idea of \"I want to climb but I can't climb if my teammates are going to ruin it for me.\"\n\nLearn the art of muting and control over your emotional capacity, and you will truly start to see yourself being put in a guided light that we call \"out of elo hell\".\n\nTLDR: Change mindset so you don't lose your shit mentally because you get tilted and start regretting playing ranked.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"reaperteaser","date":"2017-02-16T10:10:16.804+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"being ok with not ranking up is the same as accepting that losing is part of the game","replies":[]},{"poster":"Surr20plz","date":"2017-02-16T10:07:30.871+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you don't think \"it will ever happen\" then it kind of means you know you're terrible and maybe you shouldn't be playing ranked?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mr Rontastic","date":"2017-02-16T09:59:24.576+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i mean as long as you're trying to win I don't see a problem","replies":[]}]}
