Just like in NBL, Soccer or Baseball. There is the little soccer team of your high school and there are the world's masters.\nIn between is a range, and within that range there are different tiers. Just like in LoL.\n\nSo, if some guy is Bronze V - and he wins at Bronze V games, it is a personal achievment. He is better than equally skilled players. If he is a Bronze 5 Ashe Mastery 7, then this is totally supposed to be like that. I am Silver I, I will eventually get Bard Mastery 7 while I am still Silver. Basically \"super average\". Why would I not have the right to have Mastery 7 within my range? I am a Mastery 7 Bard main then, in Silver. If the matchmaking (would) work(s), I will face other Silvers, or close to that, and thus we are equal. If the other (also Silver +-) guy will meet me, a M7 Bard, then this is very justified. I had a M7 Vayne as enemy, she was good, but still very silver-ish, tumbled into her death twice by being over-cocky. A Diamon M7 Vayne would not have done that, but again, we are in Silver range.\n\nIt's like denying the trophy to the winner team of a High School soccer tournament - just because they are not playing at the FIFA World Cup. Sounds stupid, right? \n\nSo, yeah, I think the Mastery 7 means you were good with your champion and played him a lot. So far, the guys with the badge were easily better - what makes sense. If you played 47 games with a character and collected several S, you somehow either contributed to the team (supports, wards) or were personally good with it (e.g. high CS). All that means you pulled your weight. More than a guy with 6 games on said champ.\n\nIf you keep this \"I am Bronze, so I deserve no mastery 7\", well, then you should go in a corner and cry, because you are surely neither are the best at school, won't be the best driver, won't earn the most money, will not be the best at cooking,.... But still your family will still like your cooking skills and consider them as good, even you are not owning a gourmet restaurant..\n\nNo. So why would a good Bronze 5 player not get his Mastery when fighting and winning over other Bronze 5?
