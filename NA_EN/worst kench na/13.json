Is fuck really that long of a word to type out? Is it really urgent that people have to know that you said &#039;fuck&#039; instead of having them connect the dots through the asterisks, because for some reason they wouldn&#039;t know? Why does &#039;fk&#039; proliferate so much in this game?\n\nAlso, why do most League youtubers put their name in their video titles? QTpie, Tarzaned, Aphromoo, Trick2g, LL Stylish and more of them all do this. Is it a Reddit thing? Do they all have the same editor? Don&#039;t they know that people can see their channel name right below the video title?","replies":[]}
