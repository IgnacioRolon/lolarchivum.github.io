After the game I went into a custom and I was able to reproduce this.  All I did was Ctrl + 4, wait for the animation to be over, then did it again, and he does the animation and the hook has the sound, but the laugh doesn&#039;t play.  The next time, though, (the third time) it plays normally.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-06-17T18:58:19.626+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey ComeGetUrArmor (nice OW reference. :P)\n\nIf one VO line isn't finished, the next animation will play, but not the VO. Since the VO is processed, there's a bit of a trail off at the end of the line he's saying, which may be why you're experiencing this. \n\nIf you don't believe that's the case, please let me know! :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Isolate The ADC","date":"2016-06-16T20:55:49.191+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"its like that for almost everyone","replies":[]}]}
