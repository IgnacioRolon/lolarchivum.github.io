I accept that, and played the five games needed to get rid of the penalty. What I don't understand is why I was placed back into low priority que after finishing my last game.\r\n\r\nPrior to that game starting I encountered a bugsplat error after champ select and tried to reload the game after it crashed. The client then told me that it detected corrupted data, and it was necessary for me to use the repair function to fix it. After being forced to wait for the game's repair function to finish I was finally able to start the game 10-15 minutes later than the rest of the players.\r\n\r\nI honestly don't understand why I am being punished for \"going afk\" when it was impossible for me to play the game in the first place.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-11T05:41:53.067+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Disconnecting from a game *sucks*. However, it equally sucks for everyone else in the match, especially your team being down a member. Regardless of intent, a disconnection really does impact everyone in a match. This is a key reason why all disconnections are *treated equally* and why penalties cannot be modified in any way.\n\nAs a preventative step, I'd recommend working through our [Bugsplat Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes) so this issue will likely not happen again. That guide will touch on your system drivers or hardware that are likely to be causing this issue. If you have any further bugsplats after taking those steps, let me know.","replies":[]}]}
