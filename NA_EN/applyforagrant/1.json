For the first, a kit with more options is always a better kit, especially for competitive play. For the latter, while a well timed cc to interrupt a channel should feel rewarding, it cripples him in competitve play. I have said in my post that a 10 second tap on the wrist is too little, and 20-30 seconds is more fair.\n\nMaybe a compromise can be reached, where the CD is twice as long if its interrupted by someone else. For example 20 (or 30) seconds if he interrupts it himself, and 40 (or 60) seconds if somebody else interrupts it. It's still a substantial amount of time, but a lot less punishing than going full CD.

But you know why? When you initially ult, the enemy team does NOT see the circle until he jumps up. The ONLY time you can cancel his ult, is when he first starts the channel, not when he jumps. Once he is on the air, he's ulting no matter what happens. Why? Because if you could cancel your ult after the enemy team sees the circle, their flash might get baited, and that isn't fair at all baiting someone's abilities when you don't even use your ult. That would make it so Pantheon can just spam his ult and not use it to make everyone blow flash.\n\nNow for fiddles. Fiddles cast time is lower, and when you hear the sound and see him ulting, you RUN the fuck away as fast as you can, or you try and CC him. It would not be fair channeling your ult and then waiting for people to flash and then canceling it. There is no way this change can go through and be balanced. Those 2 ults are completely different and should be treated different. No idea how people could ever upvote this thinking it would be healthy for the game.

Fiddles play style is hiding to ult, he should be rewarded for playing that way. A good player does not need this change, and there is no reason to let it do this. \n\nWhile we are at it. Why not make Malzahars ult go on a low CD if it's canceled? It's because there is no reason for it to do that. That's the point of the ult since it is so powerful.
