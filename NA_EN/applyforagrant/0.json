Instead of doing %max over 4 seconds per trap, they now deal flat damage. Essentially, they're useless now aside from zoning and rooting jungle camps. They're worthless in a teamfight too because of their arming time, and they don't apply any CC either.","replies":[{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2015-07-04T01:22:05.130+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's never done % Max they nerfed it from % current and a flat to a pure flat.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"kcStranger","date":"2015-07-03T04:25:26.698+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good stuff.

It can still be really deceiving, though. (Kassadin was probably the champ that taught me the most about being careful with winrates; his performance in solo queue was total crap even though pros were showing he was good.)
