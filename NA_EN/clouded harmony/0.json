Is it really still in maintenance, or is it fully retired?  As someone who has joined LoL after it went under maintenance, I've read some old posts about the tribunal and I wanted to be a part of it. If it is really retired, you should probably put down the page itself. It's misleading.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-27T03:29:07.171+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"To be honest, I'm not entirely sure if the Tribunal will be coming back or not. As it stands, we are still working on better ways to have people submit reports. The tribunal could end up being one of the 'new' systems we bring into the fray. I also mostly agree with you on the fact that the Tribunal page should maybe be updated to reflect what's currently going on. I'll do my best to pass this along for you ^_^!","replies":[{"poster":"NinjaGuy69","date":"2017-05-27T17:26:14.248+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Broporo. I was wondering if there are any other Rioters other than Tantram on the Player Behavior Team who frequently post on these boards. Also, is the Support & Help Team a separate entity from the Player Behavior Team?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-27T17:51:49.365+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hay, Broporo isn't in yet but I'd like to poro-butt in if it's okay!  This is a great question and I couldn't resist.  :D  There is a Player Behavior team within Player Support, just as we're a Boards team within Player Support.  \n\nOn the PS side of things, the Player Behavior team works towards helping players individually with reform or context through the [ticketing system](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).  We don't regularly use the boards for that, and prefer to have one on one interactions with a player who needs our help with PB issues.  \n\nTantrum is more on the development side of PB systems. but I don't want to speak for him so definitely feel free to ask on the [PB boards](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation)!   Hope that helps clarify a bit, and thanks for asking!","replies":[{"poster":"NinjaGuy69","date":"2017-05-27T18:00:52.226+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Tantrum is more on the development side of PB systems. but I don&#x27;t want to speak for him so definitely feel free to ask on the [PB boards](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation)!

Is he the only one who lays down the law on these boards or are there others who do the same kind of job as him?","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
