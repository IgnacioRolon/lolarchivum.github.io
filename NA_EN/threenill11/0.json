My password didn't work and was prompted to reset it. After doing so, I logged back in to my account and was directed to make a new summoner name. I did so and now I am at a lvl 1 summoner with nothing. It looks like my original summoner name is still active but my original account doesn't access it. Since riot has not gotten back to me after numerous tickets, has anyone else had this problem. If so, how to resolve it?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-24T23:41:25.833+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you've logged into another, inactive account.  Submitting a ticket was a solid step, our account team is best equipped to help with recovery. I just want to give you a heads up, though, you mentioned having numerous tickets and that can absolutely cause delays and confusion.  Our team wants to be sure it's going back to the owner, so we'd be a bit suspicious about seeing so many just for one account.\n\nI also recommend using an [account recovery form](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=72416) as your ticketing method to help expedite recovery and also allows you to input an email you have access to.\n\nGood luck!","replies":[{"poster":"ThreeNill11","date":"2017-05-25T01:18:13.754+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The account I'm logging in to is my original account I've always used. After resetting my password and gaining access, it made me create a new summoner name. I did so, and now it's a brand new summoner name. I've submitted the account recovery ticket with all my info and have not received a response yet. Not sure if that's confusing, but I have my original log in name, but lost my original summoner name and had to make a new one. I cannot access my original summoner name. Also, as you can see my name (IS1ced93b3cb92f2e9f4c40) is the summoner name that it was changed to after I changed my password and logged in to my account which is not my original summoner name. So either someone else gained access to it, or riot had a bug.","replies":[]}]}]}
