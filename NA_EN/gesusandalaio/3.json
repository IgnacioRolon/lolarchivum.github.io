Seriously grow up.\n> \n> Signed - most of the community.\n\nYou are not \"Most of the community.\" I have not talked to one person who considers Mordekeiser a healthy champion anymore, mainly because he's so incredibly broken that if you nerf him he becomes useless and if you buff him he becomes completely overpowered. You act like having perma ban status is a GOOD thing, when in fact, it is not in the slightest. It means the champion frustrates virtually every single member of the community, which directly contradicts your \"most of the community\" statement which blatantly shows your ignorance.\n\nPersonally, I loved Mordekeiser before he was reworked. Playing him was a blast, and he was just becoming one of my mains. Then they said we're reworking him and since then I haven't played him because I don't want to forget the old Mordekeiser feeling, and not to mention the fact that I don't enjoy going bot lane be it support or ADC.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KMS Bismarck","date":"2015-10-16T19:23:18.612+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Dukues,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=lNUJAEGG,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2015-10-16T14:51:31.495+0000)\n>\n> I don't get these threads.
