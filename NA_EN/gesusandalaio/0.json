Yes he is ridiculously overloaded and has way too much going for him but you can't deny that he is exciting to play and unlike anything else in the game, gotta give CT credit for at least bravely attempting to redefine the mADC class.\n\nThresh isn't that bad to be honest, he is certainly overloaded but people don't necessarily hate Thresh himself, they just hate seeing the same support in literally half their games. But he was the first aggressive playmaking support and definitely made soloqueue a little easier for support mains now that they had an easier time making plays.\n\nAs for Darius, it's a love/hate relationship. I find his design obnoxious yet he's one of my favorite champions. Keep in mind this was CT's first champion and I personally think he got a bit too excited like a kid in a candy shop (he just got hired by Riot you would too) and it resulted in that mess of poor design choices and unfair mechanics we call Darius. So he had to be nerfed into a red Garen that was even more useless to his team but would completely have his way with you if you accidentally got a millimeter too close to him. However, you don't have to worry looking forward because Riot stated they would likely never create another champion like Darius, and his rework has fixed many of his design problems and gives him a more clearly defined role and playstyoe in the overall game.\n\nI hate most of those champions too but you gotta look at the bright side, try to see the positives in things.","replies":[{"poster":"Keevalroy","date":"2015-10-13T23:54:20.048+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":1,"body":">I hate most of those champions too but you gotta look at the bright side, try to see the positives in things.\n\nThe only bright side to this is that they are fun to play _AS._\n\nThat bright side is immediately nullified because they're agonizing to play _AGAINST._\n\nThis is made worse because he continues to make the same mistake over and over again while his creations end up being more toxic and infuriating than the previous.

Holy hell after seeing what happened to Mord I wouldn't be surprised if it ended up something like this:\n\n\"Hey guys, CT here, designer of widely beloved champions Darius (my first) and Kalista (my latest) along with the first rework to make Mordekaiser professionally viable. Just wanted to give you an update/sneak peek on what we have in store for our favorite sheriff in the upcoming ADC class rework. I wanted to make our premier sniper different from traditional ADC, so I made her more of a 'sniper' and less of a crit machinegun by reworking her passive into giving her more clear strengths at long range and making her significantly weaker at close range, and took a page from the excellent Ashe rework by giving Cait a unique scaling with attack speed that makes her less of a right-click machine but still entices her to build it. Changes have been made to Caitlyn's abilities that allow her to enhance them with her new passive and overall centers her power around smart management of her headshot uptime. I know Caitlyn is supposed to be the 'learn to play ADC' but trust me these new mechanics are for the better. I also decided to play up her 'scout sniper/law enforcement' theme by giving her a mechanized companion (created by Jayce and Vi and used in the new lore to help Cait conduct police business) that acts like an AI support for the team, providing global utility with vision among other tools. It's important to note that her drone is disabled while Caitlyn is dead or sitting in base, so as to stress the importance of the team's duty to protect the ADC and keep her alive. Also she can blind jungle monsters now so you can use her as a niche jungler if you want, Kindred don't get jealous now!\nChanges below, hope you guys like it!\"\n- CertainlyT\n\nHeadshot(innate) REWORKED:\nCaitlyn gains only 50% value from bonus attack speed, but her headshot passive is now a self buff activates every X seconds (reduced by attack speed) and lasts until her next autoattack, which has a windup animation twice as long as normal but is amped to have bonus range and converted to do 300%AD damage, scaling down to 50%AD based on how close the target is to her at time of cast because snipers should be weak at close range and strong at a distance. \n\n90 Caliber Net NEW EFFECT: Headshot passive is consumed if an enemy champion or large monster is hit by the net, which in addition to the headshot damage blinds them for 1.5 seconds (duration doubled against jg monsters) because she shot them in the face with a net.\n\n Ace in The Hole NEW PASSIVE:\n 25%/50%/75% (scales with ability rank) of headshot damage is added to Caitlyn's ulti as bonus damage if her passive is up at the time of cast and the ulti hits its original target. If projectile is bodyblocked, headshot will be consumed but no bonus damage will be applied to any targets. At rank 3, if ulti is casted while headshot passive is up the projectile will become a passthrough that reduces damage by 10% through each target until it reaches the original target because Caitlyn \"never misses\".\n\nPeacemaker NEW PASSIVE: Caitlyn has a UAV overwatch  drone (global/not visible) that is constantly scanning the battlefield, the drone is disabled entirely while Caitlyn is dead or standing within the base walls. While the drone is active, all allied wards have 5% increased vision radius and a random enemy champion is 'marked' every few seconds (reduced by 1 second each time a champion is hit by Q), granting true sight of them for (1 + Q ability rank) seconds. If Cait lands a headshot or ulti on a UAV marked target and the target survives, the UAV fires a hextech predator missile that deals (8% + 1% per 40AD) of the targets missing HP as magic damage. If any allied champion kills a UAV marked target, the UAV drops a care package near their current location that restores a percentage of missing HP and mana for the first champion to claim it through a 1 second channel.\n\nSnap Traps NEW PASSIVE: \n180 second internal cooldown. If Caitlyn drops below 30%HP, her drone rushes to her aid and gives her a shield for a percentage of her max HP that slowly regenerates but will not recharge if depleted. During this time all global benefits of the UAV drone will be disabled. The drone has a basic attack that slows the target and deals 25% of Cait's AD as magic damage but becomes targetable and if destroyed will dissipate Cait's shield and the drone will be disabled for 90 seconds (countdown freezes while Cait is dead/inside base).\n\nSnap Traps NEW EFFECT:\nWhile Caitlyn has headshot passive ready, max cast range of snap trap is quadrupled and if she clicks outside of the normal cast range, she consumes headshot passive and twice the normal mana cost and uses her drone to airdrop a trap using a parchute and slowly floats down to the destination over 4 seconds, granting vision in a 500 range radius while it floats down which shrinks as it gets closer to the ground. These empowered snap traps have a map limit independent to regular snap traps and passively grant vision equal to a Teemo shroom. Empowered snap traps spring with such force that the victim is briefly knocked up before getting rooted, and will be instantly marked by the drone if available. The base damage of the empowered snap trap is doubled and the AP ratio is converted to AD, but unlike regular traps the empowered traps can be disarmed by placing a pink ward within a 100 unit radius of the trap.\n\nTLDR; Genuinely good ideas but he overloads champions with convoluted mechanics.
