In my blog post, I go into a more detailed explanation of how we can infer more information on Noxus and Shurima and generally, why reports of the lore department's demise have been greatly exaggerated.  \n\nThis could have been a simple and stereotypical monster teaser - but it wasn't.  It had a narrator who became an actual character, in the sense that he underwent development and, in my case at least,  got the reader to actually care about him.  \"Care\" might be a strong word, but over the course of the story I caught myself thinking it was too bad Aelon was going to get eaten (since until the last page, I was certain he was).  \n\nThe start of Aelon's change in perspective takes place before he even hears of, let alone sees, {{champion:421}} so it does little to directly tie into her launch and from a marketing standpoint is fairly superfluous.  That it's here anyways should serve as proof that, contrary to what we've been tempted to think, **Riot does care about its game's lore.  **\n\nThe writers have always said they don't want to just do an \"info-dump\" but to give us lore in an interesting way - if this is what they mean, I'm all for it.","replies":[{"poster":"Sh√≠ny","date":"2014-12-13T16:50:04.689+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"Of course Riot is passionate about their lore, they wouldn't tear down everything we know about runeterra if they weren't.","replies":[{"poster":"Sharjo","date":"2014-12-13T17:20:52.861+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"A really accurate statement, thanks for saying it man!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2014-12-15T02:21:22.970+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lore isn't dead.

Will any of them complete their story arcs? Is it possible for them to progress beyond it? Now we have the problem of all of these stand-alone champions with little interaction with others.

Yes, we're not giving Riot the chance to explore this, but they already had this with the League.\n\nAbout Rek'sai, then what's the point of her existing as a champion?

Ezreal going to see Lux, Garen and Katarina conducting secret meetings, Vayne tracking Vladimir across the continent, Lucian leading a crusade against the Shadow Isles, Syndra making a move for power by raining orbs of magic down upon Ionia, forcing it to make a plea for assistance to Demacia. Piltover and Zaun engaging in a kind of scientific conference when something goes wrong with heimerdinger's invention, prompting them to call Cait and Vi in to investigate and discover a conspiracy against the summit. ANY number of these examples could happen AND more. These champions aren't shut-ins, most of them interact with Valoran on a daily basis some way or another. \n\nAnd Rek'sai's point is the same as Cho'gath's. Massive, nebulous beasts of the void meant to be big scary buggaboos. Not every character needs complex motivations, some just need to be monsters.

We don't know what his lore will be now. I'm not sure how giving a creature a reason to fight is a complex motivation.

Cho'gath was designed to be a monster, a beast of the void that we knew almost nothing about that could pose some threat to our world. The fact that he was a prisoner isn't so much his core design point than it is their excuse for having him fight in the league. \n\nWhich brings me to a point in the retcon's faovr. We don't NEED excuses for the champs to fight anymore.\n\nWhy would Zac join the league exactly, for example? \n\nThink about it, he's implied to be a kind of superhero, wanting to help the innocent and the weak in their times of need like his parents taught him. Why would he get involved in political struggles? It would make more sense for him to go around the land just doing good for people he came across, trying to help in little ways. Politics is not the place for anyone looking to defend the weak, these battles were fought for land grabs and petty disputes between nations, there are no innocents in (most) of these large scale conflicts.\n\nNow, without the need for these excuses, he can do what makes more sense for his character. Help anyone he comes across in danger. \n\nBut I apologize, I got way off topic. To sort of sum up my point about Rek'sai, her design is the same as Cho'gath's. They're both these massive, terrifying monsters meant to act as a kind of hint at what the void has in store, to be really cool champs and to just generally eat and kill everything in their path.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sneak Dog","date":"2014-12-16T23:05:03.709+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cho'Gath was designed around the Institute to manipulate and corrupt it.
