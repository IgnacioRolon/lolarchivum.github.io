These champs are jam packed with massive amounts of utility on top of mobility and the only trade off they have is being squishy which pretty much every dps champion is. I don't see what their real trade-offs are when they bring so much to a team. While I do like the fact that these champs make players want to be more creative with team-comps I don't see how these champions encourage diversity. Azir and Khalista force you into playing champs that counter them specifically. \r\n\r\nWhile I do find these champs to be very creative with interesting and I don't see how they fit into the League environment. These champs remind me of Lee Sin in how they have everything you want in a champion with arbitrary trade-offs. I feel like these champions existing crowds out the other guys in League who are lagging behind. We talk about increasing diversity but how does a champ like Zac survive when Azir can just Ult and say fuck you to Zac, we can even go further and ask ourselves how does Olaf deal with Khalista when his only form of engage is Axe spam. I honestly don't know how one deals with these champs beside just outright catching them out of position and dunking on them which is every bodies weakness. Maybe someone can give me another side to this and explain to me how these champions can work in a healthy way that adds more depth to the game cause it just looks like powercreep to me.","replies":[{"poster":"junglerboy16","date":"2015-02-02T18:54:06.261+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":0,"body":"They just need to make it so he can't nuke turrets with his soldiers.

His zones are temporary, but hit very hard if you stay inside them. As a result, he must either summon them on top of where you will be, or move them with a Q that has a several-second cooldown and which makes it hard for him to then dash out if he miscalculates (WQE is his best escape mechanism).\n\nZoning champions are designed to make it hard to last-hit, and to control zones of the lane. They are at their strongest when you're at range, or in their zones of control, and they win if you are afraid to go in. Their drawback is that every single one is very very squishy, and they all push the lane like crazy, making it easy for junglers to gank.
