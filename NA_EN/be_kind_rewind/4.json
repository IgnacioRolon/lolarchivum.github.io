Furthermore, going into the enemy tower is generally a death sentence, unless they have one-hit of health left - and even then, it's highly risky.\n\n* Respect the power of Towers.\n\n2) Skillshots.  \nYou learn that you must stay far enough away to have the time to dodge skillshots; standing right beside your opponent will get you hit instantly.  This is a skill you develop over time, but learn as a fundamental immediately.  I.E. \"If I sit still right beside ahri while I'm csing, I'll probably get charmed.  So I have to actually try to be safe.\"\n\n* You have to actually dodge skillshots.\n\n3) Over-extension.\nYou begin quickly developing this as soon as you play with other players.  The law is simple.  The further you push the lane, the closer you stand to the enemy tower, the further you are from *your own tower?*  The more at risk you are of being ganked and taken down quickly.  You get cocky, you get punished.  Everyone has to play cautiously, even with wards.\n\n* Shoving the lane, overextending, and arrogantly sitting against the enemy tower range, without ever falling back or playing safe, gets you ganked and killed.\n\nSo let's take a look at a problem case.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**OFFENDER 1) FIZZ \"The Freelo\" FISH {{champion:105}} **\n\nHere's the thing about this guy.  I don't think he's broken.  I think he's really strong, but not totally overwhelming.  So why is he so detested?  Why does everyone despise him so much?\nHe easily, often, breaks all three of the natural laws listed above.  And how does he do it?\n\nBy pressing \"E\".\n\nhttp://leaguecraft.com/meme/asset/meme_760px_11733.jpg\n\nHe can often dive you when you'd be safe against many, many other champions strictly because **he shrugs off tower aggro by pressing one button.**\nThis is his issue with the first law.  You're taught that, fundamentally, you're safe as long as you play cautiously and stay near your tower, and that if 1 person tries to dive you, the tower will punish them.\nHe makes this null.  He can walk in, dash through you, auto you, then press E to flick out **before one shot even hits him.**\nThis is a bad enough negligence of the first natural law, but it extends to all the others as well.\n\nIf he chooses to play like this, he can walk right up to you, casually, and blast a chunk of targeted damage on you without you getting any reaction at all.  Because as soon as you use a punishing skillshots, a root, a charm, a snare, a stun, a bind?  **Dang, he ~~dodged it~~ pressed E.  Dang, ~~I missed~~ he pressed E.  Dang, ~~I got outplayed~~ he pressed E.  Again.**\n\nThis is a huge defiance of the second natural law.  Extreme mobility already gives some champions too much strength in this area - they can get up close in danger-range, but still avoid damage by using mobility moves for dodging.\n\nBut for him to have a mobility move **that also makes all shots go through him?**  Seriously?  It's a double-advantage and a double-nuisance because it has NOTHING to do with your skill or his skill, it has NOTHING to do with aim or dodging, it is simply a matter of \n{{champion:105}} YOUR SHOT GOES RIGHT THROUGH ME {{champion:105}}\n\nIn the exact same vein, his E allows him to often times neglect the 3rd natural law as well.\nGanking often times is contingent upon the jungler being skilled enough - and the enemy laner being bad enough - that they land one root, one bind, one knockup, etc. when the enemy overextends.  The 2v1 damage is then usually enough to secure a kill.\nProblem being?\nHis E not only allows him to wait out and ignore whatever that ganking ability is (think: elise's snare {{champion:60}}) by pressing E, but it *also* has such mobility that he can escape much quicker than most of his midlane opponents.\n\nCompound this all with the fact that he gets to ignore unit collision for *reasons*, and you've got someone slippery enough to walk and hop away from every gank you throw at him - even when he's **sitting against your tower range as a melee champion.**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n**OFFENDER 2) ZED \"b-but muh zhonyas counter!\" THE NINJA** {{champion:238}} \n\nIt seems to be that every Zed player KNOWS they're breaking the natural laws, because the half of the time they *aren't* breaking them, they're sitting there spamming laugh.\n\nhttp://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/attachment.php?attachmentid=1061847&d=1409718393\n\nI don't need to elaborate much on this one, but I might anyway.\n\n1) The first law.\nHis \"reworked\" ultimate makes it so that he can simultaneously **commit fully to a kill and not commit at all.**  Hmm.  Want some damage on the enemy midlaner?  Press R.  Shadow shuriken.  Press R again.\nDid they die?  Congrats, you're probably spamming laugh and saying \"your fault for trying to have mana sustain instead of buying ~~an MR item~~ QSS to survive.\"\nDid they survive, or bind/root you?  Well, thank goodness you can warp out the instant the CC ends by pressing R again!\n\n2) The second law AND 3) the third law.\nActually, once again, they tie in together.  If he sits up at your face, he can shadow away from skillshots, so he already has that advantage.  But furthermore, if you try to land something critical on him *before he ultis,* then he has untargetability (just like Fizz) by simply pressing R - boom, free waste of your CC skillshot, and probably your only chance at survival!\n\nA common misconception is that you can simply CC him as soon as he ults and appears behind you.  The reason this argument is null is because **with 99% of any other champions in the game, if they are sitting still taking tower shots while rooted/stunned/snared at a low level, they're dead.**  You're low enough once the CC duration ends to be finished off by the laner+spare tower shots.\nThe only way to possibly survive such a stupid, hapless dive is if, I don't know, you could literally just warp right back out instantaneously.\n\nOh.\n\nWait.\n\n{{champion:238}} **HA.

Anivia's Q has a little delay between two casts. It is almost impossible to hit a champion too close by. I assume you don't actually play many champions, do you?

I stopped playing him because I felt that other champions were far better. even if Zed did give me kills, he didn't give me games.\n1: he is VERY VERY item dependent. if you can deprive him of gold, you win, Zed's now useless for the rest of the game, harass him as much as possible, get him pushed out.\n2: Zhonia's is a hard counter, and in the mid lane, where most champions scale on ap as opposed to ad, Zhonias can be effectively rushed, rendering Zed's kill potential 0 against a smart player. If you don't rush zhonias as an ap champ agaisnt zed, I don't and never will feel sorry when he ults you and drops you from 100 to 0\n3: he is easily counterpicked. Break the meta, play a tank mid lane against him, all he has is a physical damage poke. Go Malphite or Sion mid, see if Zed can kill you. **The meta is not an ironclad rulebook, it's a guideline. So you usually see Zed, Ahri, Fizz, Kat, etc mid? counterpick their champion, don't pick a midlaner. **\n4: You have to be caught out to die to him. He has 0 teamfight, no initiation, is stuck in melee range, and you're squishy as fuck. If you have your team with you, and they're smart, it's easy to shut down zed before he can do anything. \n5: Hard cc renders his ult useless. \n\nLet me come back to the bold. The meta is a GUIDELINE, not a rulebook. According to the meta, there's generally a set pool of champions that go in each lane. Lets pull Yasuo out of the hat to use as an example. He can be played top or mid, but is too squishy to deal with the bruisers and raw early game damage of the top metapool has to offer. So he's sent mid. Now do the math, Yas is weak against top laners like riven and fiora, but can deal with the meta midlaners. So, assuming your team is smart and saves mid for your last pick, or yas and their top laner has been locked in, it's your turn to pick. What do you do, pick a mid laner because it fits the meta, or pick a champion with enough early game aggression to shut down Yas? Say you pick Vel'Koz, who has no mobility, and relies only on skillshots. He's a midlaner, yes, but he gets destroyed by Yas, you lost midlane, yas is fed, a fed yas ends games. what about Fiora? She's mobile, has one of, if not the most agressive early games in the game, insane gap closing, insane dueling. Under no circumstance can a Yas beat a Fiora of equal skill in lane. You've won lane, outfarmed yas, potentially snowballed, and are doing good. \n\nIf you're having problems with a champion, and adhere to the metagame, that's your fault. Add Sion, Chogath, and Fiora mid to your roster. Think about an adc or mage top lane. AP carry that snowballs effectively in the bot lane instead of an adc. There are countless ways to counter 'OP' champions with a little creativity. Not only do you confuse your opponent, potentially putting them in lane against somebody they don't know how to play against, but it can fill any gaps you have in your team as well. \n\nMetabreaks that have worked well for me:\nSion mid (if the team needs a tank or against early game monsters (my counterpick for Fizz))\nFiora mid (against melee midlaners, if we have a tank in top or jungle OR we have bruisers in top and jungle)\nSwain as APC instead of an ADC (if opponents are weak to CC)\nQuinn top (against anything but a tank, and if we have a tank in the jungle)","replies":[{"poster":"Be Kind Rewind","date":"2015-01-08T08:19:13.500+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=JESUSSAYSNO,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=UEhV99HN,comment-id=001a,timestamp=2015-01-08T07:36:47.039+0000)\n>\n> I think if you think any champion is broken or overpowered, you need get better at the game.

I stopped playing him because I felt that other champions were far better. even if Zed did give me kills, he didn't give me games.\n> 1: he is VERY VERY item dependent. if you can deprive him of gold, you win, Zed's now useless for the rest of the game, harass him as much as possible, get him pushed out.\n> 2: Zhonia's is a hard counter, and in the mid lane, where most champions scale on ap as opposed to ad, Zhonias can be effectively rushed, rendering Zed's kill potential 0 against a smart player. If you don't rush zhonias as an ap champ agaisnt zed, I don't and never will feel sorry when he ults you and drops you from 100 to 0\n> 3: he is easily counterpicked. Break the meta, play a tank mid lane against him, all he has is a physical damage poke. Go Malphite or Sion mid, see if Zed can kill you. **The meta is not an ironclad rulebook, it's a guideline. So you usually see Zed, Ahri, Fizz, Kat, etc mid? counterpick their champion, don't pick a midlaner. **\n> 4: You have to be caught out to die to him. He has 0 teamfight, no initiation, is stuck in melee range, and you're squishy as fuck. If you have your team with you, and they're smart, it's easy to shut down zed before he can do anything. \n> 5: Hard cc renders his ult useless. \n> \n> Let me come back to the bold. The meta is a GUIDELINE, not a rulebook. According to the meta, there's generally a set pool of champions that go in each lane. Lets pull Yasuo out of the hat to use as an example. He can be played top or mid, but is too squishy to deal with the bruisers and raw early game damage of the top metapool has to offer. So he's sent mid. Now do the math, Yas is weak against top laners like riven and fiora, but can deal with the meta midlaners. So, assuming your team is smart and saves mid for your last pick, or yas and their top laner has been locked in, it's your turn to pick. What do you do, pick a mid laner because it fits the meta, or pick a champion with enough early game aggression to shut down Yas? Say you pick Vel'Koz, who has no mobility, and relies only on skillshots. He's a midlaner, yes, but he gets destroyed by Yas, you lost midlane, yas is fed, a fed yas ends games. what about Fiora? She's mobile, has one of, if not the most agressive early games in the game, insane gap closing, insane dueling. Under no circumstance can a Yas beat a Fiora of equal skill in lane. You've won lane, outfarmed yas, potentially snowballed, and are doing good. \n> \n> If you're having problems with a champion, and adhere to the metagame, that's your fault. Add Sion, Chogath, and Fiora mid to your roster. Think about an adc or mage top lane. AP carry that snowballs effectively in the bot lane instead of an adc. There are countless ways to counter 'OP' champions with a little creativity. Not only do you confuse your opponent, potentially putting them in lane against somebody they don't know how to play against, but it can fill any gaps you have in your team as well. \n> \n> Metabreaks that have worked well for me:\n> Sion mid (if the team needs a tank or against early game monsters (my counterpick for Fizz))\n> Fiora mid (against melee midlaners, if we have a tank in top or jungle OR we have bruisers in top and jungle)\n> Swain as APC instead of an ADC (if opponents are weak to CC)\n> Quinn top (against anything but a tank, and if we have a tank in the jungle)\n\nThere is so much overwhelmingly arrogant and incorrect information here that I don't even want to begin dissecting it.\n\nTo begin with.  It's very clear that you have this vision of everyone as a bunch of bronzies who think they're stuck in ELO hell, and choose to complain instead of adapting.  If you don't drop this mindset, we can't go anywhere.\n\nMoving on.  Your points on Zed are all fallacious.  \"Zed is overpowered in the mage-meta midlane?  don't take a mage midlane.\"  That might be a fair thought, except that your point is ceding how overpowered he is already.  \n\nHe's strong enough to singlehandedly force an entire class out.  \n\nYou're screwed unless you break the meta, most likely inhibiting your team comp, by taking a bruiser mid instead of the bursty AP damage your team needs.  And then?  He has a slightly harder time killing you (how much does your semi-armor build protect you against youmuu's+last whisper+cleaver+botrk?  Your armor takes it from \"you die instantly\" to \"you die after a moment longer than before\".\n\n\"But he doesn't start with armorpen items.\"\nAnd you don't start with armor items.\n\nYou also don't start with Zhonya's.\n\nWhich brings us to our next point.  Your absolutely ridiculous claim that you are adamantly required to rush armguard against Zed.\n\nDon't you get it?  You're proving how overbearing he is once again; almost all of his opponents are mana-hungry mages, in even *more* hurt due to the sudden mana regen nerfs on chalice/athene's and now on the morello's build path too.  You're giving us two options.\n\n1) Rush armguard to survive his level 6 burst inside your tower.  The cost: you run out of mana after a few cycles and then you sit there unable to do anything but try to AA farm under tower (while he's diving you.)  He might have to kill your adc or support instead.  (He can 100-0 even rushing mobis and shadow-ganking botlane.)\n\n2) You rush a mana regen item so that you can keep up with his energy-based farming and poking.  You're still not \"on par\" with his no-item state because you still go OoM often after the mana regen nerfs, whereas he continues poking almost freely while his energy rapidly regenerates.\nExcept he got to use his gold on an offensive item.  Most likely brutalizer or hexdrinker.  At which point, you're left with him having more power, much better sustain, no meaningful resource, better cs'ing, more mobility, better roaming and the ability to towerdive you **as well as having more burst.**  But at least you can use a few more cycles of spells before going OoM, right?\n\nThe most ridiculous part is perhaps you saying that you have to be caught out to be killed by him.  Whoops.  Got caught out sitting against my tower again.  Guess it was my fault for getting in his diving range by not hiding behind the inner turret, right?\n\nOh, do you mean teamfights, where he excels as the best get-in, kill, and get-out assassin in the game?  All other assassins generally pay for their commitment by dying, or attempting to continue brawling.  Zed warps into the team brawl, bursts whichever squishy he chooses (or your tank, at this point, to be honest), warps out and walks away.","replies":[{"poster":"TheRainInSpain","date":"2015-01-08T14:02:08.376+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I find that he had correct information, the problem being that Zed is one of the few champions you really need to know how to play against, instead of relying on raw skill // general experience.  He is an absolute terror if you don't know how to beat him.  The amount of people that can beat him easily, or know how to beat him easily, are few and far in between when talking about solo queue (both normal and ranked).\n\nZed is gold dependent.  That I know to be true.  If Zed doesn't get his core items fast enough (Bork + LW), then his threat is considerably weakened during and after the laning phase.\n\nZed loses a lot of power if you Zhonya when he ults.  Mages who rush Zhonya in their core builds are likely to deflect his all in, and then destroy him if he cannot immediately get away.  Lissandra is one of the few mages I've seen with my own eyes to be able to do this regularly.  Too bad no one plays her anymore in solo queue.\n\nZed excels at poking and poking before going in for the kill.  If you pick something that is used to being poked all day long (e.g. a Cho'Gath) and has the CC to set up a kill when your macho man Lee Sin arrives to kick Zed's head in, then you'll have a better time in lane.\n\nBut who does that anymore?  The latest mage meta is to rush Morell, and Zhonya rush mages are pretty scarce as is.  Tanks in the mid lane?  The last time I've seen an actual bruiser, let alone a tank, was back in Season 3 when I faced off against (the irony) a Cho'Gath and he proceeded to do exactly what I said, against me, as a caster (forget if I was an AD or AP caster, but I remember I didn't have my unorthodox midlaners then).  And then who really camps Zed?  It would seem that people expect that even if you camp him, he'd still do relatively well and thus later become the menace that we all deep down fear.  The Zed Mode.\n\nIf you let Zed gets ahead, I will agree, Zed will dominate hard.  So you actively defend against him getting ahead.  And again, no one does that.  So he gets ahead, and he dominates.  Zed is the new Jax.

These champions have a weakness, I know Fizz has many.  I cannot say the same for Zed because I don't have/play him.  In that same note, even though I personally think he's OP (compared to Fizz), I can't even say that because I haven't played as him to declare that.\n\nFizz has high mana costs, he's mostly AP-based, he's melee, and he lacks sustain.  That's a few of his weaknesses.  Instead of everyone just saying YEAH HE'S OP, why don't some of us who play them explain why they can be countered IF they can be countered?\n\n~GL","replies":[{"poster":"mi ramfan","date":"2015-01-08T03:46:49.743+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":3,"body":"The problem is that when you try to think of weaknesses to cite for these champions, not many come to mind, and those they do have are offset by their enormous strengths. As a player of that champion, it's your job to mount a defense along with anyone who thinks they're not overpowered. It's unrealistic to expect people who dislike a champion to attempt to defend them. Learn to counterplay them, sure, but a lot of these champions' counterplay is in champion select and it's not fun having your main be unplayable for 3 months because X champion who counters them is the new flavor of the month. \n\nFizz, for example, is melee, squishy, and easy to harass when he last hits. In theory. \n\nIn practice, his E allows him to **100% negate** whatever ability it is you're maxing first. So essentially, you've invested most of your skill points into your strongest ability, but Fizz's E makes all of the points you've invested into that one ability completely worthless with just one point. Since his passive gives him both resistance to autoattacks and the ability to path through minions, he doesn't have the last hitting trouble you would expect either. Mana costs are not nearly as important when you're reliably getting blue buffs. \n\nNow consider Zed, the other champion cited in the OP. His weaknesses are similar to Fizz in that he's a squishy melee and is somewhat energy gated. However, while he is vulnerable to harass while farming, his passive makes his last hitting completely braindead in the early laning phase and his W->Q waveclear allows him to completely trivialize the latter half of the laning phase and roam wherever he pleases. On top of this, his extreme mobility thanks to his shadows makes it very difficult to punish him for positioning mistakes or for misjudging his damage on a dive. Even if he overestimates his damage and fails to kill you, his shadows will allow him to get away where any other champion would have taken serious damage or even died. \n\nMost assassins share the same problem; when you die to them, you die almost instantly without much opportunity to react, and even when the assassin makes a mistake or overestimates their damage against you, they use their inherent mobility to escape, making them impossible to punish like we would any other champion. We acknowledge those things as the strengths of Zed and Fizz.\n\nWe just don't think that \"instantly kills you if you make one small mistake\" and \"can't be punished for making mistakes\" are values that should EVER be the strength of any champion in League of Legends, let alone both at once.","replies":[{"poster":"GLWuffie","date":"2015-01-08T04:43:17.691+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":13,"body":"Countering a few points for Fizz:\n\nIt's not 100% to dodge/negate abilities, otherwise it'd be a REAL problem.  AOE/Tethers abilities still affect him (also anything that hit him before hand, so bleeds/dots still apply if hit before).\n\nAnd you're not supposed to just try for an all-in with your main ability at Fizz, you gotta bait him to do it.  It's like Tryndamere, do you go all in while he's past level 6?  No, you bait his ult out, wait for it to finish (before trying to secure the kill, but make sure his health his health is still low), and then you finish him off.  Similarly Sivir's Spell Shield you should do the same, trying to bait it out so you can do your REAL damage.\n\nYou could either bait it out and go for the damage afterwards, or force him to continually use it and drain his mana (which it takes a lot to do anyways).\n\nAssassins are supposed to kill squishy targets, they're ASSASSINS.  They are supposed to be in and out burst dealers.  If they're instantly killing you, then you're their prime target (squishy).  Assassins favor ADCs because they too build mainly attack and little defences.  What about squishy mages?  Make them unsquishy.  Majority of mages have CC and/or are ranged, which can hurt Fizz personally speaking.\n\nFizz has a slightly different way of making mistakes, and his E isn't always the fix.  Even if it IS the fix, he just used an ability that could've been used for damage (wave clear especially), used a ton of mana for it.
