This is especially common on 4K which isn't currently supported  or resolutions exceeding 1920x1080.  Your best bet would be to reduce your resolution, and to also reset your config in case any modifications or corruption messed it up:\n\nLog into the game client.\nNavigate to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config\nDelete the file  named **game.cfg** and **persistedsettings.json**\nGo into a custom game and verify that settings have saved properly.  Leave game to sync settings.\n\nI hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
