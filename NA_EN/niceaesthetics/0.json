I called him \"shit\", and an \"idiot\" and I did talk a lot. I don't think its my profanity that got me banned, I've done worse and seen worse so I don't think calling him shit or an idiot is what got me banned, probably the length. While I don't agree with Riot's no talkback approach, the player I was talking with told me to \"kys\" and called us all \"r%%%%%s\" so I lost my cool after that. I acknowledge what I did wrong a%%%%%s probably worth a 10 or 25 game chat ban. \n\nGame 2 I kinda see why but I don't think it warrants a chat ban skip and to escalate it to a 14 day ban. Is this worth an appeal, or should I just appeal anyways even if it isn't?\n\nI got a 25 game one back around September, it dropped and I got a 10 game one around a month I would say? I did not receive a 25 one and this one was an immediate 14 day ban.\n\nI really don't want to get perma'd after the next two weeks, sucks that I'm on vacation, I planned to grind it out. Too bad I had to get into this previous game.\n\nEdit: I actually got the 10 game on an alt I had, if my memory serves orrect I have not gotten a chat restriction on this account since last September. This was a straight up 14 day ban without any chat restriction.","replies":[{"poster":"zPOOPz","date":"2019-04-14T04:49:15.415+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just out of curiosity\n\n> NiceAesthetics: hmm another reason to ban for saying r%%%%%\n> Nic%%%%%hetics: i mean its not liked i got camped mid\n> NiceAesthetics: hmm its not like i got triple ganked\n\nWhat happened here?

He still insta locked and that was all I said. MAKES SENSE!!!!\n\nSo I don't know....maybe these chat bans going up to account bans are really not all that fair considering what little speaking it takes to get one, yet insta lockers and trolls just get off scott free.","replies":[]}]}]}
