Essentially, it is trying to launch itself, but something is preventing it from doing so.

I don't know what I did differently, but I allowed League the second time and the patcher would launch.\nThanks for taking your time to check this out, though! :3 <3","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"galactus1989","date":"2016-05-05T14:24:58.772+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi, I also wanted to chime in here. I am having the same issue as the OP. I click to launch League, I see the logo briefly, it may flicker once or twice and then it disappears, no client launched.\n\nI did notice an avast popup, alerting me to a suspicious program (lolupdater, oh the irony, even avast sees patches as cancer). So, I set up an exclusion for LoL and even disabled Avast, attempted to relaunch and nothing. I restarted my computer at this point and tried again (avast still disabled) and still nothing.\n\nI am at a loss here, so any help would be greatly appreciated. Next step for me will probably be a fresh install of LoL or something.","replies":[{"poster":"One Hot Minute","date":"2016-05-05T14:32:16.427+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"After i excluded it, it launched like the breeze.  Make sure u did all your steps as you described them.  Retrace all your steps.  If the exact same thing is still happening, disable avast, make sure LoL is excluded.","replies":[]}]}]}
