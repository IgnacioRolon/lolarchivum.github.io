Tryndamere has a cheesy dueling ability with his ult and crits, so you have to be stomping to contest his split push solo and either way one slip up and he kills them and keeps pushing. It takes pressure off a game you should be otherwise winning by a champion who doesn't even have to win his lane to do that. So you have to send two teammates back just to be safe and make him fall back, so either the pushing goes from 5v4 to 3v4  or you're forced to back off, all because of one champion, who again doesn't have to win lane to do that.\n\nI get that's not a Diamond and above problem, but it is for everyone else. There's plenty of Tryndameres who split push with no map awareness while the enemy team is in their base at Gold too, but don't you think he should be reworked by now? This has been a problem plaguing solo queue for ages.","replies":[{"poster":"LordGeovanni","date":"2019-07-26T18:30:59.180+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Read again i didnt say split up and get pwned by him i said collapse which means move as a team to 5 man (or how ever much is normally pushing mid pushes past the river then goes to collapse on him together)  shut down that annoying split pusher. \nit is a problem for everyone else because dps carries seem to have a problem with following their front line they like to sit back say they 'playing safe' let what ever happen to the front line without reacting to help and lose the fight by time they start to help. Its largely exacerbated by streamers telling people to just play safe when you can play as safe as you want if you neglect to get towers because the enemy is 4 under the tower while you have 5 (i even see 1 person push whole 5 man teams off of a tower) i think that it becomes a acceptable loss to dive a tower and lose people at level 8 by level 13 towers are bearly a threat if you have at least a fighter or tank that inst building Trinity into Spear of Shojin","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"KlydeFrog","date":"2019-07-25T05:04:19.144+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":10,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Critmaster Garen","date":"2019-07-25T05:07:44.443+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=KlydeFrog,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=r6EAoE10,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2019-07-25T05:04:19.144+0000)\n>\n> ..Removed by Moderation..\n\nthat doesnt mean a lot.\n\ntryndameres kit is just full of poorly designed mechanics. the reliance on winning lane through getting a few lucky crits in a row in an early trade, the invulnerability on his ult, his whole playstile revolving around nothing but rage split pushing top keep you hostage in lane, even if you won earlier against him.\n\nthey deemed {{champion:10}} and {{champion:78}} old invincibility ults as toxic and reworked them in a way where they cant press r anymore and faceroll everything infront of them.\n\nyet tryndamere still exists in his state. hes probably one of the worst champion designs in this game, and its incredible that he didnt receive an {{champion:266}} level VGU yet.","replies":[{"poster":"U R Good At Game","date":"2019-07-25T20:13:46.537+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Critmaster Garen,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=r6EAoE10,comment-id=00040000,timestamp=2019-07-25T05:07:44.443+0000)\n> \n> they deemed {{champion:10}} and {{champion:78}} old invincibility ults as toxic and reworked them in a way where they cant press r anymore and faceroll everything infront of them.\n> \n\nCouple issues with your comparison.

That's like being mad the 6-1 zed one shot you as soraka. Even then your second played is lulu which literally hard counters trynd. He enrages you slow him with Q to force his E. Once is E is down you poly him for 2.5 seconds which ALSO reduces movement speed. Now he has no E and no way to re-close the distance.

There are multiple picks in legit every single role that can single handedly remove trynds ult from the equation. He's been this strong the whole time, people are actually finally noticing.

I'm not gonna list them any because literally half the support roster is tanks with point and click cc or control mages with mass cc, go nuts. Did your JG, Top, AND supp already pick?

Also many damage champion had better survival. His ult on the other hand did not changed. Back in the day unless he managed to hit someone squishy it took him much longer to kill, than now. If you kill the same target in 2 seconds instead of 10 that's a clear buff. And that is exactly what happened. Back in the day the pure armor Malph could take Trynd's attack pretty much forever. Now a strong Trynd with armor pen. build kills him in 3 seconds.\n\nThe latter is the same point as my first. Just because something can be countered it doesn't mean it's weak.

It isnt a rough matchup in the terms of split pushing, or that Malphtie can actually kill you. What I meant to say that the speed of split pushing will be negated by the fact that malphite can take away your attack speed and hold minions back, and if you rotate to teamfight he can take your attack and movement speed for that as well. Its not hard, its annoying for Tryn players to deal with that.","replies":[{"poster":"Meteora707","date":"2019-07-25T14:35:53.527+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"I mean the malphite is going to be stuck babysitting trynd for the entire game while still taking turret losses and his jungler losing a lot of camps, its not a winning matchup for the malphite at all.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"azazxer","date":"2019-07-26T17:19:01.827+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Weird way to spell yasuo hmmm","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Kombinator","date":"2019-07-26T10:45:33.363+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He left meta during the tank meta, and i wonder when he comes back.
