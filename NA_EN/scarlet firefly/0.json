All the other champion&#039;s voices are okay. My in-game sounds are all ok so it&#039;s not a problem on my end.\r\nI would like someone from Riot to shed some light into this, because it would be a shame to have wasted 1820 RP on this skin, and not be able to hear the voiceover.","replies":[{"poster":"LostFr0st","date":"2016-03-03T00:14:23.067+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"From another post: http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report/VGdhEKVG-project-yis-in-game-voice-is-at-a-whisper-in-volume?comment=0001","replies":[{"poster":"Scarlet Firefly","date":"2016-03-03T00:18:23.120+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=LostFr0st,realm=NA,application-id=LqLKtMpN,discussion-id=itEkdrub,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-03-03T00:14:23.067+0000)\n>\n> From another post: http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report/VGdhEKVG-project-yis-in-game-voice-is-at-a-whisper-in-volume?comment=0001\n\nThanks, I didn't realize this was posted before.
