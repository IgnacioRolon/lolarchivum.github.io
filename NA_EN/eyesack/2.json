People come here for quite a few reasons, and assuming those reasons are shared among the League population in general is invalid.\n\nHowever, your question is important, and it does have an answer. When people go on the Boards, what do they see? Probably something like \"Zed sucks\" \"Dynamic Queue sucks\" \"Fizz sucks\", etc (I'm not taking any sides on these issues, I'm just using them as examples). These show up all the time, and almost more importantly, opinions disagreeing with them are almost universally downvoted and ridiculed.

I think for a population of 10 million, you would only need to sample 2k to have a value that has a 99% confidence rating of being within a 3% margin of Error. So if out of 2000 people, 90% of them said they hated Dynamic Q. There's a 99% chance that the real value is between 87%-93%.\n\n There is just one problem where this experiment would break down. (Which could very well be the case.) Not everyone goes to boards. And the people who are on Boards, may not accurately represent the population. People on boards would tend to socialize more, and a likely more competitive if they are trying to stay on top of their game. Especially so With Game play and balance, as people are quick to address grievances. \n\nAs a result, Boards does not offer the random sampling that is needed to make this experiment accurate. If you wanted random sampling, you would issue the survey within the client to say. 10,000 people who logged in.","replies":[]},{"poster":"APrinnyDood","date":"2016-05-31T22:55:28.198+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":2,"body":"\"random pool\"\n\nYou know, I'm pretty sure that a forum isn't a form of random sampling. In fact, I know for a fact that taking polls from preexisting groups like forums and calling them representative is a major fucking \"DO NOT DO\" for social psychology. Taking a small, voluntary group and calling it representative is the kind of thing that would laughed at in academia.\n\nTaking the opinion of the Boards on anything and calling it representative of the League population is like polling members of the Republican National Committee and saying that their opinions are representative of the U.S. population. You've selected a group that doesn't represent the population.","replies":[]},{"poster":"therealdragon","date":"2016-05-31T22:42:14.691+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":7,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ZeusHasRefresher,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=TXg6XecE,comment-id=00060000,timestamp=2016-05-31T22:16:37.910+0000)\n>\n> if you learned some stats in school, you know that in a random pool of something if 80% of the pool has a thing, then no matter how you extend the pool 80% of the popolution will still have the same thing\n> \n> if 90% of board+reddit players hate Dynamic garbage, then 90% (nearly) of lol players will hate it.\n\nOk I liked the other reply. This one is just plain illogical though.\n\nJust because say 8000/10000 people on the boards don't like DQ doesn't mean that 48m/60m people don't like it. (Let's be generous and say 7m people quit).\n\nNow if, say, 100k people got surveyed on the client and 80k explicitly said they hated DQ, then they'd probably keep solo Q. But 10k people (and again, we're being generous) wouldn't be a large enough sample size to represent 60m people.","replies":[{"poster":"ACENOX","date":"2016-05-31T22:56:13.039+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":2,"body":"riot consider that \"big number\" is over 500, since lyte used this stat when he was talking about number of games\n\nwhich means that 8000/10000 is really big","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"HowPlayGAEM","date":"2016-05-31T22:03:56.538+0000","up_votes":27,"down_votes":8,"body":"https://playoverwatch.com/","replies":[]},{"poster":"eastcoastblaze","date":"2016-05-31T22:11:34.210+0000","up_votes":22,"down_votes":5,"body":"Well its been a fun ride boys.

I have absolutely no idea how this game went from fine to absolute shit in less than a year. The ridiculous Season 6 balance changes and remakes of champions that didn't need them were already pushing me towards the edge. Then the obvious favoritism for certain champs (hello Lucian, Ekko, Zed), and this here was the final nail in the coffin.\n\nGood job Riot. Maybe one day you will learn you actually have to listen to the people that play your game and give you money, but when you pull your heads out of your asses, it will be far too late.\n\nLeague of Legends, 2010-2016 RIP, your incompetent leadership drove you into the ground.\n\nI hope the rest of you do the same and vote with your wallets, and / or quit for good.
