Silver 3.\n\nGameplay and Balance in a nutshell boys. Silver 3, says something really stupid, calls a Diamond player who is calibers above them in level \"retarded\" because they flat out are incapable of understanding the arguments at hand. \n\nOkay. Since you don't understand, let me actually break it down for you since you have a lack of experience.\n\nMechanics at a very, very, very basic level can be practiced in bots. By this I mean uh. Bronze and low Silver. That's it. \n\nOutside of that, you  learn how to mechanically outplay people when you're going against people at your level.\n\nThe issue is you can't do that outside of Ranked when you're top 1%. Because you have to face them in Ranked-- even -if- your Normals MMR is that level (and a lot of high rated players don't have high high rated Normals MMR because they don't give a shit in Normals), they're -still- unlikely to be providing the level of play you need to against to learn. Because they're likely doing the same thing, or, just not giving a fuck.\n\nSo if you can't go against people who are (and I seriously hate this word) \"tryharding\" outside of Ranked, then you want to learn how to play someone at that level because a Champion counters your pool, what do you do?\n\nYou can learn more Champions but to get that good it's not done overnight. It's done over a long, long, long period. To deal with a single Champion who could very well be nerfed right the next patch.\n\nOr you can learn to deal with your counter, but it's significantly harder to learn at that level. Plus you're still countered and even though you may learn how to deal with it, a counter is a counter nonetheless and it'll still impact your winrate.\n\nGragas -is- stupid right now and -is- making it hard to deal with a lot of shit in games. He -is- a problem.\n\nTelling someone they're a retard because they aren't using the AI to learn things is uh. Retarded.\n\nThe -only- thing \"bot matches\" are good for is learning stuff like animation canceling (Riven basically) and new Jungle routes.\n\nYou don't even do \"bot matches\" for those, you make custom games with only yourself. And those are the bare, bare, bare basics that still get you nowhere near Diamond level in the slightest.\n\nBut I don't know what else I'd expect from a Silver 3.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Amélie Cauchemar","date":"2016-04-15T06:57:30.349+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SmallLoan1mil,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=s4z5Bqqi,comment-id=000600000000000000000000,timestamp=2016-04-15T05:23:27.854+0000)\n>\n> then go bots retard!

I wouldn't be diamond.\n\n\nAnd there really aren't any difficult champs in the game. \n\nKindred in a nutshell is using auto q e w auto q auto q auto q auto auto.\n\nHow you use all of that will separate you from the rest. \n\n\n\nThere's a person with a video that describes it better than I can with footage.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ek7GByXkSmU\n\nWatch it all the way through.

At this point I only pick him if Darius is banned. You have to pray your team doesn't feed early and then wait 15 minutes before you can actually start stomping your opponent, can't stop them from TP'ing in front of you to go get their botlane fed, it feels like you get shredded to nothing in teamfights regardless of your tank items, can't splitpush thanks to no wards and death timers, Master Yi, etc. For every reason I can think of to pick Nasus, I can give 5 reasons not to. Can't remember the last time I did well on Nasus, played Garen for the 1st time in months, went 16/1, killed the fed midlaner who usually dooms Nasus, and it all took about 1/3rd the effort.\n\nEven SirHcez hardly plays him anymore, and he loses every game when he does.","replies":[]}]}
