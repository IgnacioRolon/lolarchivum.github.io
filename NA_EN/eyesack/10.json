I could understand if you said 3 roles, but playing all 5 in ranked is just...not realistic in most cases. \n\nNot trying to be rude or anything, just saying you don't have a realistic expectation. I understand being frustrated by someone who refuses to play more than one role, though, but I don't get expecting everyone to play every role. I honestly don't even see the point in that.\n\n\"generally the other people who play are just a waste of time.\"\n\nSadly this says more about you than the people you play with, if this is your attitude.
