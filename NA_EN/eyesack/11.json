Tons of free tank stats + strong LS AND Kite that gives him more bullets so he doesn't actually every have to re-load.\n\nI would be happy if they removed the extra bullet from the dash, or made the reload time about twice as long.  The re-load time is not even noticeable as it is now.\n\nThey could also make Death Dance not have Conditional Spell Vamp.  That would be a good enough hit to his top lane.\n\n(I do not really know how these would affect him, but these are the problems I struggle with when against Graves top.)","replies":[]}]}]}
