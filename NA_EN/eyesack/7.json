People who enjoy DQ are not here - they are not making any posts.\n2. People who are neutral are not here - they are not making any posts.\n3. People who are here are the ones that only complain, and that's you.\n\nYou're basically taking the lack of evidence that we exist (because we are silent) as evidence that we don't exist, trying to establish yourselves as the majority. You're not a majority, you're just very vocal about your opinion and we're not bothering with trying to put you down - which is our mistake.\nBut it's not like i can start this movement on my own. We simply don't care because Riot is doing us a favor and you're barking in vain.\n\nAnd let's tally you up, shall we?\nA couple of threads each day, a couple of hundred upvotes each time and let's be generous and say that a thread is about 100 replies long, and all replies are in your favor. And i'm not even going to mention that the same people are cirklejerking the different threads about DQ, essentially inflating your own egos but for the sake of the argument, let's say that you're all special individuals that don't like DQ.\n\nThat's:\n (1 OP + 200 upvotes + 100 replies) x 2 (threads) = 602 SQ cultists.\nIn 10 days - 6020 SQ cultists.\nIn a month - 18060 SQ cultists. Even better.\nIn 3 months - 54180 SQ cultists. Wow.\n\nOK, you've all been saying there has been no SQ for 3 months so i've very crudely (and intentionally inaccurately) calculated your numbers so far - just to give you a fighting chance. In reality, these numbers are way smaller.\nAccording to Forbes (a 2014 statistic, couldn't find the recent ones sorry), 27 million players play league daily while the concurrent peak is 7.5 million. I'll use the smaller number because it seems more correct. After this fact, i think that i've read somewhere that only 50% of the community even plays ranked. That's 3.75 million players.\n\n_**Let's run the numbers again:**_\nRiot's surveys right now say 55% is for DQ, 20% says don't care and 25% says no. Keep in mind that surveys are not going to all players but let's say it was 50% of this community.\nThat's 1 875 000 surveys sent (even this number is way too high but let's roll with it).\n\n* 1 031 250 people are up for DQ.\n* 375 000 people are neutral.\n* _**468 750 people are SQ cultists.**_\n\n#This is literally almost 10 times the inflated amount i gave you. Your actual percentage right now (according to my BS data) is 2.89% of the entire community who was surveyed).\n\nAnd then you accuse Riot of rigging the data? You should trust them more than me. You have no shame.\nYou don't like that it isn't in your favor so you're calling it rigged as an excuse.\n\nMy data (this BS calculation) is complete BS. It's taken from various sources, it's outdated and i even estimated your numbers (bases on your argument of the negative board dwellers who live and breathe for the sole purpose of taking down DQ).\nEven if it's BS, you don't even stand a chance.\n\nDemocracy at work.

Boosting is legal and even more efficient.

Oh buddy, I love this new system, it's so easy to manipulate. You mentioned problems in SoloQ, yea remember when boosting was illegal? Good times..... This is just a culmination of giving people \"what they think they want\" without worrying about the consequences. \n\nFinally, if the system could work at even a 50% intelligence rate that would be pretty decent all things considered. If no-one abused the system it would work, if there were no 4 man teams the system would work. If there was no DQ at Gold+ the system would work. So many \"Ifs\" but there are too many \"buts\" as a result. You may say soloQ had it's issues, and you're right, but the issues there were nothing compared to the current unsolvable problems that plague DQ.\n\nRambling, mildly incoherent, but the point of DQ being of terrible design to cope with \"friends/Elo Boosters\" is disgusting at it's core. It's great that you have friends an all, but in a competitive scenario, even in real life you'd likely pick the best people whether they're your friends or not. \n\n(If you had to play basketball with a dream team, you'd probably pick Lebron or Shaq back in the day, not your classmate who's just pretty good.)

It's not about advantage or disadvantage to the solo player. One game you will have advantage, the other you won't. It doesn't matter if the premade #s match up, because, aside from differences in role preference, you end up on either side of the equation an equal amount.\n\nBut it's not fun to be the odd man out. Nor does it give an accurate representation of your ability, which is the whole purpose of the ladder.  \n\nThere is absolutely no justification for dynamic queue with respect to stable, competitive gameplay. Dynamic queue already existed, it was callled normal draft.

Did you get there yourself or did you get there as part of a group or three or four or five? These aren't the same styles of play, and don't reflect the same skill levels.\n\nSay you've been playing with friends the entire time, and have finally reached Diamond with them. As a group, your elo is there, at Diamond. You've been playing against other groups (according to Riot) and so have risen through the \"group\" metagame. Try playing Shaco or Nasus or Darius against a communicating, focused group. You'll quickly become useless. Many of these champions don't work like they do in a true solo queue, because they're very easy to shut down and kite together.\n\nSo now that you're diamond, you figure you want to try to go even higher by yourself - but now you're not in a group, you're alone. The metagame is different, and more importantly, the games are different. If you're actually at the diamond or higher skill level, you won't see much change. However, if you're actually low-platinum in level, you'll find yourself getting crushed by superior skill and you will find it much harder to survive and get carrier by your higher-skilled friends. You'll drop in elo as a solo player.\n\nTrue Solo Queue doesn't have this asterisk. You get to an elo by your own skill, and not by that of others. If you solo in Dynamic, you still run the possibility of playing with and against groups of three or four, and that asterisk remains, only it's even more convoluted now - solo queue style and team style are merging into the same game? It doesn't work.\nFor the sake of competitive integrity, I dislike dynamic queue as a ranked system. It's a ranking that won't mean anything. I think the system is absolutely fine for normal play, and should be actively encouraged in that department, but for ranked laddering it's honestly an insult to solo players. It says, you're not worth our time. Only groups.\n\nThe biggest problem is that currently all of the solo players and the group players are currently forced into the one queue. I personally just want to play solo queue to prove my skill level. I'm fine playing with friends and carrying/getting carried, but it's not how I want to be judged. I want to be judged by my skill, not my friends'.","replies":[{"poster":"Dr Birdie","date":"2016-04-20T18:40:15.984+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So the only way to judge real skill is through solo play.

It is how well you are able to stroke your own ego.\n\nYour argument is self-defeating.\n\nLCS is team vs team, which is one of the ranked queue options that have now been taken away to feed dynamic queue.\n\nWe didn't just lose solo queue, where the vast majority of players, who don't have the time or inclination to practice as part of a formal team, have a chance to test themselves.\n\nWe also lost ranked teams, the only place a group of people could get together and practice as a team. Which, by the way, is not the same as communication or teamwork.  You don't need to be part of a premade group to learn how to communicate or work as a team, in fact, solo queue would work better for that since it forces you to learn to work with -different- people, rather than just learn how to handle a few of your friends and be done with it.\n\nNow you just have one big great blob, dynamic queue, which is no different from normal draft mode, except that the ELO/MMR is funneled into League Points and you have a visible standing.\n\nThere is no argument that can be made for the use of dynamic queue to replace solo and team ranked from the standpoint of game quality or competition.\n\nWhich is why we see the kind of nonsense that you're spouting. The game is meant to be played as a team. Yes, as a team. 5 people, not 3 + 1 + 1.\n\nThat's not a team, that's a group and two extras.
