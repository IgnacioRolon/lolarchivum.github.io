It cannot be. You&#039;re shoving premades and solo players onto the same ladder, and by doing this you have made each player&#039;s elo WORTHLESS. A silver level player can EASILY get carried to diamond if he has 3-4 pals to carry him there. And if he plays games with his now-diamond mmr he will RUIN the game for 4 other people. If you don&#039;t think that&#039;s a problem, you (looking at you riot) are an idiot.\n\nEach player&#039;s mmr no longer matters as of s6. There&#039;s too many variables now. You can&#039;t look at 2 player&#039;s mmr and justifiably say who is the better solo queue player. One could have higher mmr than the other just by getting carried by his friends. Dynamic queue therefore has made mmr meaningless. It means nothing.\n\nHow do we make dynamic queue a true ladder experience? Quite simply, you can&#039;t. By its very nature you&#039;re combining several different queues into one mmr. Which is unbelievably stupid. &#039;But now you can play ranked with your frandssss&#039;. NO. THERE IS NO RANKED ANYMORE. IF THE LADDER IS MEANINGLESS, IT IS NOT RANKED.\n\nSo basically this is riot&#039;s logic: we want to allow you to play with your friends (something you could already do in normal games) but they wanted it to be ranked experience (which we also already had with teambuilder). But they wanted it to be easy for the player. You could queue as 1, 2, 3, 4, even 5 players all in the same ladder, all with the same mmr. Yea? Well, in doing so, ranked has been destroyed. Now there are just 2 versions of normal draft queue, one just happens to have meaningless divisions attached to with some meaningless rewards.\n\nThere is no ranked play anymore. You want a real, fair, meaningful competitive experience? Go play a different game.\n\nEDIT: na spelling.","replies":[{"poster":"ZsakbaMacska","date":"2016-04-04T13:56:43.142+0000","up_votes":30,"down_votes":6,"body":"I agree with you man,  this game sucks in terms of matchmaking, yesterday i was playing duoq with my friend we are at the same skill level with same elo(last season both of us were plats, but in our team we had a silver4 hecarim because he was duo with his gold1 friend, he was boosting him, however we lost due to hecarim got punished for his awful engages  which wouldnt be punished in silver4 but in gold1 and plat5 it does get punished.

That's why the system is supposed to be prioritizing premades vs premades. In my experience from Draft normals, I am better playing solo than in a premade without chat. It's pretty much an unwritten rule that you are expected to use some voice chat if you are queuing up as a premade.\n\nThis is where some Solo players will get cheated. They will get thrown in with a four man premade that isn't using chat, which is basically the same as four solo players that just happen to know each other. Then you'll get pitted against a four or five man that is using chat. Playing field isn't equal.\n\nThis is mostly Riot's fault for not implementing a voice chat.

In SC2, you are judged on a _**1v1 W/L scenario**_ featuring only your MMR. As you win, your MMR improves and you are matched with this within your MMR at your Tier. You can literally look at the ladder to see who your likely opponents are going to be. In SC2, you are only responsible for yourself and your own strategies. The only other variable to take into account is your opponent. Now, you will still play people outside your Tier if you do well enough, but my point is that your W/L should typically be split 50/50 as you win because you will undoubtedly run into others with your MMR. SC2's ladder system isn't perfect, but because it only has to keep into account a 1v1 scenario, it's far more accurate as a ladder experience.\n\nIn League, you have a 5v5 W/L scenario that factors in your personal MMR, your ELO, and your Division. Unfortunately, looking at the ladder of your division is completely pointless; because of the many variables and high population, you'll rarely play the people in your own Division and you'll still end up matched against people in other Divisions/Tiers. That's not necessarily a problem, but it is NOT a true ladder experience as others demand for. Those same variables are applied to the other 9 people going into a game with you and W/L is determined based more on their performance than yours alone.\n\nWhile I can't say for sure given I'm not a High ELO player, it seems that League's ladder system is more cohesive the higher up you go because the population decreases in each tier. That's probably an intended design because it's more reliable at higher ELO.

And that's the point : Division is really different than MMR. When i was on losing streak at plat 5 i ended up playing with full gold 3/4 players and against full gold 3/4 players, because that's where my mmr did belong. If you are on a winning streak (like 15 games in a row), your MMR grew faster than your LP, so you can play vs diamonds and still be gold I. I remember a guy who left all his BO to stay bronze 1 but still had a diamond ELO, so the system matched him with and against diamond even tough he was bronze.\n\n(TL;DR : The divisions are just some shiny grades you show to your friends, they do not matter at all to determine against who and with who you will be matched, note that sc2 works exactly the same way, some of my GM friend are constantly leaving the challenger leagues on purpose with their ||||||||||||||| accounts to stay anonymous, so they ends up being plat most time, but they are matched against GM and people their own MMR).\n\nNo, there are other reasons you sometimes feel like the ennemy team was way worse than you or way better than you and you felt like the MMR thing wasnt performant :\n\n- Smurfs (when you face a smurf in sc2 they shit on you in 4 minuts, you surrender and you forget about it, in LoL it can go through a painfull 20min rape)\n- In starcraft 2, most people only play one race, so they have 3 match up to master, in LoL if you are OTP you have 130 match up to know (more realistically 30 because you are on a lane, but you have to account for the jungler or global ult as well), if you are not OTP and you play 20 champs you have 20*30 = 600 match up to know. \nThat's a lot, and this explains alone the difference of performances of the players between all their games, plus the fact some match ups are favored in one or the other side. \n- that's only for the laning phase, if we consider the whole teamplay part now :\n130 champs\n6 bans\nit means that there are 124x123x122x121x120x119x118x117x116x115 combinations (5.9* 10^20)\nIt's pretty hard to know every comp, and pretty hard to know how to play with and against every comp, with time and experience you basically understand what is the \"global strategy\" based on your composition and the opponent one (1 3 1, 4 1, split push, group mid, skirmishers, early vs late, poke team, engage team, burst, sustain, all in team , juggermaw, protect the adc...)\n\nI like to think that LoL requires a lot more knowledge than starcraft 2 to be played correctly, whereas starcraft requires more multitask and maybe more mecanics/apm.","replies":[{"poster":"Jasiwel","date":"2016-04-05T17:31:33.133+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah, I see.

Because there is no other game that doesn't use this same method.","replies":[{"poster":"Kouhey","date":"2016-04-05T15:52:09.890+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Lemme just tell you this, dota2 has two separate mmr for premade and solo, do you get it now?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Dukues","date":"2016-04-04T19:26:54.894+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":4,"body":"Who the F has 3-4 diamond friends that want to spend time carrying their scrub ass from like silver/gold to diamond.......

It cannot be. You&#039;re shoving premades and solo players onto the same ladder, and by doing this you have made each player&#039;s elo WORTHLESS. A silver level player can EASILY get carried to diamond if he has 3-4 pals to carry him there. And if he plays games with his now-diamond mmr he will RUIN the game for 4 other people. If you don&#039;t think that&#039;s a problem, you (looking at you riot) are an idiot.\n> \n> Each player&#039;s mmr no longer matters as of s6. There&#039;s too many variables now. You can&#039;t look at 2 player&#039;s mmr and justifiably say who is the better solo queue player. One could have higher mmr than the other just by getting carriee by his friends. Dynamique queue therefore has made mmr meaningless. It means nothing.\n> \n> How do we make dynamique and true ladder experience? Quite simply, you can&#039;t. By its very nature you&#039;re combining several different queues into one mmr. Which is unbelievably stupid. &#039;But now you can play ranked with your frandssss&#039;. NO. THERE IS NO RANKED ANYMORE. IF THE LADDER IS MEANINGLESS, IT IS NOT RANKED.\n> \n> So basically this is riot&#039;s logic: we want to allow you to play woth your friends (something you could already do in normal games) but they wanted it to be ranked experience (which we also already had with teambuilder). But they wanted it to be easy for the player. You could queue as 1, 2, 3, 4, even 5 players all in the same ladder, all with the same mmr. Yea? Well, in doing so, ranked has been destroyed. Now there are just 2 versions of normal draft queue, one just happens to have meaningless divisions attached to with some meaningless rewards.\n> \n> There is no ranked play anymore. You want a real, fair, meaningful competitive experience? Go play a different game.\n\nPoor baby.\n\nKnow someone who hit challenger last season.\n\n He also hit challenger this season.\n\nSo yea.

They have people with full time jobs boosting in LoL. I mean...XWX (XiaoWeiXiao) from TiP that got banned for elo boosting) completely stopped playing in a competitive sense because he actually makes more money now from boosting than playing.\n\nHe could actually be on a team right now since he was banned from competitive games until February of this year, but he has actually turned down a few offers. Though he is technically playing in the LSPL, he is still known to be boosting a bit more openly now (Riot NA doesn't handle the competitive rulings in China and the LSPL is about the equivalent of the challenger league. or the closest to it).","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Joquan","date":"2016-04-05T16:02:44.783+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's way more important for the high elo players than the low elo.\n\nWith long queue times 30+ min, it's possible for a D2 to be playing with masters and challengers.\n\nHell, even challengers get full solo vs LCS teams, it's unbalanced up there.\n\nPlayers such as Gross Gore who were stuck in masters for a long time got top 50 challenger due to DQ.
