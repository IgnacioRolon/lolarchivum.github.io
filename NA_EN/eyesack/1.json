I think I am starting to get a feel for Yasuo because I play him more often than anything else, and I also always go mid lane,  so I get used to doing the same sorts of things, in the same place every game.   Yes, I am overcompensating for Yasuo's garbage moves, garbage range and garbage tools by being very decisive, very alpha and very intelligent.  That doesn't change the fact that even I, from my newbie perspective, can see that every champion I have encountered has the tools to defeat and roll me or even a better yasuo if they did not shit the bed per se, without fail.  Yasuo deserves to be pumped full of some very hot, potent buffs that he may be genuinely virile and competitive. Right now, he is utterly flaccid.

Potential to ruin the team encounter and the least amount of damage of the support champions.\n\nKarma is a much better pick.  Why?  High damage potential and AoE/mobility shielding.    Even single target shields offer that much more. \n\nNow we could go down the avenues that... Bard has a heal and a magical journey... but his heals are low and misplaced journey causes death more than escapes.  (You never hear about a misplaced shielding/movement causing death.)\n\nWhen facing a team fight I much rather have a burst of speed/mobility and a shielding on all team members than a gold that doesn't last nearly long enough, misses or worse loses us the team fight.\n\nLastly the champion reminds me of the male version of Lux when she came out.
