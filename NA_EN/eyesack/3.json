It is useful for carrying low elo games, I wouldn't argue he is easily destroyed by the right champs in higher elo.\n\nI am also aware they nerfed his AP ratio. I'm also aware he is still the only champ to be able to push towers solo, no minions required. Baron as well, no team required, makes it easier to take if none of the enemies notice you missing while your team split pushes.\n\nTo say he is garbage is a huge over statement. He does need another item compared to his old build but that never seems to be a problem for me. I'm able to gank early enough that I can snowball pretty early. His main damage source is also his E. My biggest problem is the lack of AoE damage since the loss of Devourer/Rageblade.\n\nI'm not at all offended by the way, I was taking your post a little more on the offensive side but you're making good conversation.

The idea is to heal so fast they can't kill you. It is a super sustain build, you can heal so fast by auto attacking that towers can't kill you as long as you keep hitting them. He is weak though, if for any reason you stop auto attacking, you will die super easy. He has to be played right but if done well, he can carry super easy.\n\nI take tele/smite so I can solo rush a tower in an empty lane, then hide and tele to another lane as the enemy team rushes to stop the first lane from being pushed. Take another tower in another lane, then solo baron or maybe reverse order, depending on what the enemy team is up to. Map awareness is helpful.\n\nBack before he was nerfed I could auto attack the enemy tank so fast my life would drop to 100 or below, while their damage dealers tried to kill me, then spike back to full, over and over and over.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Lord Galvatron","date":"2016-06-08T13:33:27.124+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Anyone try the new Trinity on Xin Zhao yet?","replies":[{"poster":"xxxDogmanxxx","date":"2016-06-09T01:46:35.753+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's still really expensive for a jungler.
