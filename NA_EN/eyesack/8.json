Everyone&#039;s definitions vary of what a healthy assassin should be. With the assassin class update apparently happening in november, I&#039;m curious what Riot&#039;s definition of a healthy assassin is. \r\n\r\nPersonally I think it&#039;s an assassin that can pull off his job but offers plenty of opportunity for counterplay.\r\n\r\nI could bring up Zed as an argument because you can counterplay his assassination by building qss or zhonyas, but I feel like being able to just build an item to completely nullify his ult isn&#039;t very good counterplay. Plus he is very safe in his assassination attempt, something goes wrong he just blinks out. That isn&#039;t exactly high risk gameplay.\r\n\r\nAnother assassin we have is Rengar, and people don&#039;t like him because when he is fed you see him and suddenly your adc is dead. He doesn&#039;t however, have a great escape UNLESS he still has his ult after the kill. Atleast that is some sort of a tradeoff, but getting instantly deleted isn&#039;t exactly super healthy gameplay.\r\n\r\nSo i guess the lines are really blurred when it comes to what is a healthy assassin. I&#039;m curious what Riot/anyone has to say about what a healthy assassin would be like.","replies":[{"poster":"Verxint","date":"2016-04-14T17:58:20.652+0000","up_votes":31,"down_votes":2,"body":"A healthy assassin\n-has to acquire damage items to remain relevant and continue assassinating\n-has to outplay or out think you to get a kill on even terms\n-has the tools to outplay you and the damage to kill you\n-has opportunities for its target to fight back that are *effective*\n-has difficulty recovering from failed assassinations\n-has little effect on a fight if abilities are used improperly\n\nHigh risk, high reward, skill based.","replies":[{"poster":"Woook3r","date":"2016-04-14T18:48:39.728+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":19,"body":"Id rather have low risk, medium reward, skill based.","replies":[{"poster":"Verxint","date":"2016-04-14T19:01:21.575+0000","up_votes":29,"down_votes":3,"body":"That's not an assassin.

His escapes are far too strong and he's way too durable for an assassin. His kit also has no trade-offs.

Akali will generally chunk you out and rely on her shroud while Talon will do the same with his ult. Comparitivly an Ekko will CC you an kill you in the stun duration, if he plays right there isn't a correct reaction because anyone who could react is stunned. Zed drops his entire combo on you in half a second then peaces out.

We know this game isn't all about KDA. However it never feels good to die, and that's the whole reason the assassin class exists, to deal high amounts of damage. That's it.\n\nIt's easier to blame them instead of taking responsibility for a silly mistake you made, and that's almost all of the deaths that happen against assassins, or at least that's how it used to be. Now it's hard to catch these champions, and when you do they sustain damage quite well.\n\nI believe assassins get out of hand when we try to make them a more reliable pick. I can play against a fed feast or famine champion. I know what's going to happen when they hit their 3rd kill, and really we all should know. Even so, there's a reason those types of champions thrived in low ELO.\n\nAssassins are cheesy champions by nature. They rely on getting kills early game so they can run around the map taking out other champions who are out of position, standing near an unwarded bush, or split pushing alone. **They should thrive on disorganized teams.** They should never be a huge threat outside of 1v1 or 1v2 situations.\n\nA healthy assassin should have high mobility, deal a lot of damage, and have little to no CC. Any sort of lockdown, silence, or escape is toxic when an assassin has it.\n\nThey also need to be quite squishy so that any sort of lockdown messes them up. That's the trade that needs to be made for the high mobility and damage. When you add escapes, hard CC, or any sort of reliability into an assassin's kit, they become too oppressive.\n\nIf an assassin is building defensive stats then they should be significantly punished for doing that. That's the way it used to be, but now there aren't really anymore true glass canon assassins. Fiora got a rework, and even Yasuo builds Maw of Malmortius, Guardian Angel, and Sterak's Gage now. \n\nCurrently I would say Katarina, Kassadin, and Ahri fit the bill, but I believe that's more because of how mages aren't really at the center of the meta right now.
