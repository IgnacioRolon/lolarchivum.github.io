How to troubleshoot?","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello,\r\n\r\nI have been playing league for a while and unfortunately have began to get pretty nasty ping spikes making the game pretty unplayable (jump from 80 ping to 450+ ping every 30 secs or so typically). I do not believe it is my internet however as I get consistent ping of 12-15 ms when pinging google (using ping -t www.google.com at the command line). If anyone could offer some first steps to trouble shooting this that would be awesome, thanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-04T18:20:49.292+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It seems like your network can't hold on to a stable connection and even suffering from packet loss, which can cause sudden ping spikes like this.  I recommend running a [log reader](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743-Connection-Troubleshooting-Log-Reader) for that match to know for sure.  The results may show that you have packet loss, but whatever it finds will also bring a set of troubleshooting steps specific to your issue.  Hopefully, that will help you get back in game!","replies":[]},{"poster":"hyperion3182","date":"2016-10-04T11:35:12.602+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Anything new in your home?
