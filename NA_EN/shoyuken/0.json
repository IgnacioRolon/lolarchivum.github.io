When will you fix it?\n\nAfter hitting in my password, it tries to log on, I get to the lobby, but it immediately says \"Trying to reconnect..\" but wont reconnect, and offers to \"exit instead\". Hence, I never get to play.\n\nLuckily, after months of having had this problem, I finally discovered a \"quick fix\" thanks to user @Zyreon here: https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/Bp9NwPHz-trying-to-reconnect-on-a-mac?show=flat&amp;page=3\n\nI am creating a new post as the one above is locked and I hope this will help a couple of people. It seems that if you reduce your signal strength of your wifi router, it will work. Read @Zyreons detailed trouble shooting. It helped a lot of people. \n\nShame on riot for not offering a proper fix, and shame on riot for closing the post mentioned above, so people cant even discuss the problem further and get help from other users on the quick fix.\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-18T01:44:59.074+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What's happening here, in basic terms, is that your network is having a really hard time getting a solid connection to the login servers specifically (League has different servers that need to be connected to, and not reaching certain servers isn't entirely uncommon on the internet). If your network can't reach those servers you won't be able to have that connection needed to login. \n\nThe 'fix' mentioned by Zyreons mentions using a hotspot, which essentially is using a completely different network. That network was able to bridge that connection successfully allowing him access to the login servers.\n\nIf you're still having problems logging in, your honest best bet is to do some general troubleshooting to make sure your network is able to get a reliable signal with our servers. Check off the steps in the [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues), including adjusting your DNS settings and possibly trying a VPN, and that should get you on the right track to an overall fix instead of a hotspot bandaid. Not to mention you're likely to get high ping spikes on a hotspot just due to how the technology isn't designed for online gaming =\\ . Best to solve the issue at hand rather than a temporary unstable fix.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shoyuken","date":"2018-01-18T19:45:09.500+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"problem still persists... is there any post where Riot has at least acknowledged the problem?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shoyuken","date":"2017-12-20T19:52:30.999+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Update: Seems to have smth to do with it, but cant get it to work consistently with Zyreons fix..\n\nRiot should just fix this finally..","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shoyuken","date":"2017-12-18T09:18:38.009+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cheers for your feedback mate, will look into it. But tbh, im on a VDSL 50mbit line here, and have never had any problems. The problems only started as soon as the new LoL Launcher was released. And hundreds of folks seem to have exactly the same problem, without any reports of previous problems. Also, it seems to work just fine on Windows...","replies":[]}]}
