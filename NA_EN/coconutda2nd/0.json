Recently had a pretty bad game and mud was slung on our team. Mid laner wants to add me after to say something and he was moderately chill for how bad the game was. So I add him hoping it wasn&#039;t going to be just shit talked but he went in. I have lots of pretty shitty stuff here and I can screen shot it, I&#039;m just wondering if there&#039;s a place to go to report it.","replies":[{"poster":"Morality Coach","date":"2016-08-20T18:36:19.179+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think player support wants any reports outside of the Instant Feedback system anymore.
