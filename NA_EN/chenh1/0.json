This is a team game that actually encourages friends to get together and you know, play the game. There are plenty of reasons that a 5 man pre-made may want to play in a normal. \n\n* Maybe they are warming up. \n* Maybe some of their friends haven't played in a while.\n* Maybe they are trying out some strategies.\n* Maybe they are experimenting.\n* Or maybe they *just don't want to play ranked*.\n\nThis is the attitude the OP is talking about. Just because they are in a normal doesn't mean they have to \"sandbag\" their game. They don't have to play poorly or play down. They conversely don't have to go to some other land (ranked) and play on the competitive ladder just because they happened to get 5 people together.\n\nIf you get beat by a pre-made in normals it doesn't mean they need to be tossed into another game mode so that you might win the next one. Get more coordinated with your team (the ones you brought with you and your \"temporary teammates\"), work on the parts of the game where you are losing (like vision control), work on your own play. Don't just decide to punish 5 friends having fun just because they played that particular game better than your team :\\","replies":[{"poster":"LeeDark","date":"2015-03-20T05:24:35.311+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":5,"body":"So, we should just accept the fact that their version of fun is ruining everyone else's?

You aren't talking about a team who is flaming all chat, trolling the enemy, etc... you **are** talking about a team that is using good game knowledge, mechanics and skill. \n\n>  Fuck that.  If they are trying a new comp or something, fine, but if they are dropping deep wards in a normal and 4 man roaming for ganks, then fuck it. \n\nBad news. Dropping deep wards, whether a normal or ranked, is good habit and practice. It is how you gain knowledge so you can make better informed decisions in the game. You don't want them to have that knowledge? Get some sweepers and pinks, learn to clear out and control your half of the map. **Warding** is not an advanced tactic, it's a foundation skill of the game.\n\n  As for the 4 man goon squad, that is how you destroy an unorganized team that has no concept of warding. Ward up and catch them walking through the fog of war / overextending all day. It's an easy concept. You don't go where you don't have vision or else you risk your life.\n\n> I'll just afk farm and wait until the surrender.  There is NO reason whatsoever to keep playing that game, because that is what they want, and I don't have to let them have it.\n\nThis statement clearly shows what you actually want : to win. Without having to put any effort in. Seriously? You will just afk farm and surrender just because a team is more coordinated than yours? Just because they are playing the game differently from you so they should be tossed in a different queue so you can get a match you can win easily? **Of course** they want to keep playing the game, that is why they queue'ed up. However, they probably also wanted a good game. Just because they are more coordinated than your team (remember, this complaint was about being outplayed with 2-3 of your own friends) or just more skilled / versed in the game doesn't mean they are jerks or some smurfing ranked team. I have been in some incredibly coordinated pug teams where we all were just on the same page.\n\n> \n> If they are obviously just having fun, I'll never notice that they are even a premade team.  If the communication advantage is painfully obvious and they are doing things that most only do in ranked, then seriously, fuck them, fuck you, and I'll punish them by denying them their fun just like they are doing to us.\n\nSeriously? You just have this sixth sense that knows they can't possibly be typing to each other ever? You also have a sense that prevents you from communicating with your team? Really, if \"doing things that most only do in ranked\" means dropping wards, picking people off for playing poorly, and being coordinated are just things people do in ranked, what kind of games are you playing? Are we complaining about 5 man ARAM teams here? We are talking about summoners rift normals right? Where foundational skills include but are not limited to 1) Drop a ward 2) capitalize on mistakes 3) talk to your team.\n\n*You* are mad because you are being outplayed and blindly running at the enemy nexus will no longer work. You want games handed to you and better players will not let that happen.\n\n* Learn how to get vision control or at least deny vision in your own territory\n* Talk with your team / learn communication\n* Learn base tactics in this game (ex. goon squad; which is countered by vision btw) and what to do when you encounter those tactics\n\nI get that you were using a tactic / gameplan where you didn't have to ward or do any of this stuff. Now it's not working and that is frustrating. However, you have to learn how to beat those tactics. You can't just say they play better than me and that ruins my fun. What makes you so entitled? You are not complaining about them flaming, trolling, etc... You are strictly complaining about the way they play being effective against how you play. If you want a straight up stomp game by running down lanes, play co-op vs ai or custom games. When you go into PvP you accept that you are going to have to deal with a variety of teams and tactics. You will win some, you will lose some. Don't be mad just because other teams have a playstyle that punishes yours and you don't know how to fix it. Learn how to fix it.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Biffolo","date":"2015-03-19T20:56:13.052+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=PrincePapa,realm=NA,application-id=Ir7ZrJjF,discussion-id=oHZ5RwbM,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2015-03-19T20:23:22.719+0000)\n>\n> That's probably the only case of actual \"tryharding\" I can think of.

This something is in most cases simply having the brain of the opposite gender (yes, male and female brains ARE different almost by as much as male humans are different from male pigs or same for females); a consistent minority has been traditionally caused by some kind of shock connected to sexuality (and Freud was not entirely wrong on this), and finally the recent \"fashionable\" aspect of the phenomenon has as a result that tons of people that are just depressed or insatisfied try to find the reason for their insatisfaction in a supposed oppression from society.\nSo, homosexuality overall is only a medical matter. Doesn't mean they should be looked upon like handicapped or sick (no handicapped or sick person should receive any kind of offense either obviously, but I see why one wouldn't like to be considered one), but it means we should stop being afraid and bitchy and acknowledge that it is neither a normal character (as in having black or blue eyes in central europe) as in frequent, neither a normal character as in collaborating towards viability and species survival, since it takes away the pulsion to reproduce.

Punishments aren't the issue here, it's whats allowed and what isn't. Playing with friends is, scripting isn't. That is that.\n-And they do have every right to do that. It's being smart and looking out for themselves in the way they can. If it saves them money there is no reason to not do it. \"Oh sir people dislike what we are doing, but if we do things the way they want we lose millions.\" Anyone would take the millions of dollars in that case, because it's simply the smart thing to do from a logical/strategic standpoint.\n-How are they not people?

You know why? Because the game is built around using communication and teamwork. They are using an idea that is ENCOURAGED by the developers to play with people. Do other people have access to the advantage? Absolutely. If you care THAT much about the end result of the game, then you should be willing to put the extra effort into gaining an advantage. Also, what you define as essentially legal and what is actually legal are two different things. Just because something is essentially legal but is NOT legal does not mean it should be done. But when players are ENCOURAGED to queue up with friends then why wouldn't they do it? I doubt the makers would push people to do something that is cheating, because news flash... It's NOT cheating. Just because you don't like it does not mean it is cheating. Everyone has the advantage available to them, find a group of players and learn to play well with them if you are that concerned about it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"manbearswine","date":"2015-03-21T18:36:26.322+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=KillerMan2219,realm=NA,application-id=Ir7ZrJjF,discussion-id=oHZ5RwbM,comment-id=0000000000010000000000000000000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2015-03-21T15:57:28.166+0000)\n>\n> -What you may consider \"unfair\" others may be perfectly ok with and think it within the realm of fairness, and as such comes down to a morally subjective thing which we clearly have different views on.\n\nYes,evolution is also just an opinion and subjective thing which people just have different views on,EVERYTHING,and I mean EVERYTHING can be denied if the person is willing to be delusional enough,that doesn't mean there really isn't much to argue about.\n\nNow try to answer these questions honestly:\n1)Do you think \"tryhard\"(that is communicating picks,strategy,coordination,not talking about who did what this afternoon) communication with 4 people you know and practiced with on skype gives you a large notable advantage?\n2)Do you think your opponents share this advantage?\n\nNow if you haven't shoved your head spectacularly deep up your asshole,the answer to these questions and why it is equivalent to cheating is obvious.\n\n> -Once again, in plenty of peoples eyes that is 100% legitimate.

The most probable way for the extra uses of this term to become so widespread is that people who hated gays started to direct the term towards anything they don't like; or it could be that my generation started calling anything anyone did that was slightly non-macho gay (I can still remember when this started, and I'm really hoping my friends and I aren't really partially responsible for such a horrible social norm).\n\nNow, when you say \"gay\", people will understand that you just mean to say it's not a good thing. However, that connotative meaning is a problem in of itself. The reason we shouldn't use \"gay\" as a negative term isn't because we might offend someone. It's because when we do, we associate 'gay' with 'bad'. Homophobia is already rampant enough without subconscious correlations between, for example, Teemo players and the LGBT community.\n\nAnd you might think \"That's a load of bull, that's not how the brain works\" but think about that study where psychologists gave children a white doll and a black doll and asked which one was good and which was bad (I don't know how old/educated/socially aware you are, but if you've never heard of this that's the TL;DR). The children, who weren't even really old enough to understand the concept of racism, still decided the black doll was bad, because the concept had worked it's way into their subconscious already. The study that was done back in the Brown v Board days kinda makes sense, because there were literally people screaming out that being black was a bad thing. But they repeated the study more recently, and found the same results. The chances of anyone saying it to them point blank are extremely low these days, so you can conclude that some part of American culture has an underlying prejudice that even a child can pick up and apply to their psyche.\n\nNow maybe you're not mature enough to understand this concept (many people will grow old and die without ever reaching the level of maturity required to truly care about others and try to enact change), but at the very least, \"tryharding CAN be very gay\"? That doesn't even sound right. Surely you know enough words to be able to say what you really want. Annoying, obnoxious, intolerable, stupid, toxic, etc. are all better options than \"gay\".","replies":[{"poster":"manbearswine","date":"2015-03-21T15:14:17.333+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=missinggrave,realm=NA,application-id=Ir7ZrJjF,discussion-id=oHZ5RwbM,comment-id=00000000000400000000000000000000000000000000000000000001,timestamp=2015-03-20T17:54:23.382+0000)\n>\n\nWell I'm not 100% sure who this post is aimed at,but I'm gonna reply anyway.\n\n> (( Quick question, did I seem offended or trying to boost my ego?\n\nIt's more about trying to get offended than actually getting offended,and well yes,when people start pretending like they aren't familiar with the \"unofficial\"(which aren't even that \"unofficial\" anymore,just check the definition of the word gay in the oxford dictionary) use of the word when everyone knows they are familiar with it,it does in fact seem like actively trying to get offended,but well if a person is actually gay and it was used offensively to him in the past it's a bit different,but you should try to remember that on the internet nobody knows if you are gay or not(unless you tell them),so it's unlikely someone is using it in that way.\n\n>Because if so, that wasn't my intention.
