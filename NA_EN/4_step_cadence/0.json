It goes into how the Minotaurs sided with Noxus, how Alistar was captured, and how it affected him. More importantly though, it gives more insight into his friendship with Ayelia and their escape.\n\nHopefully he'll receive a color story, and maybe even a VO update, sometime in the future.","replies":[{"poster":"Chromatic Eagle","date":"2020-01-17T15:30:52.446+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> More importantly though, it gives more incite into his friendship with Ayelia and their escape.\n\nShe was part of his old lore?","replies":[{"poster":"4 Step Cadence","date":"2020-01-17T15:41:36.577+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yep.
