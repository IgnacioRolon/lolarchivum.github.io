I just want my account back and my case to serve as an example for future cases so this never happens again.\r\n\r\nI have been playing League since season 3 and have invested over $1000 into this game. This is the only game I play and I have dedicated myself to it. About 2 weeks ago, my account got permabanned. In the couple games, I had used some light vulgar language (who doesn't), and so when my teammates got mad, they decided to report me and my account got flagged. Due to my account having a 2 week suspension in the past, this isolated incident resulted in a permaban.\r\n\r\nI submitted many many support tickets, pleading that this was an isolated event and that they could even check my history to see that negative behavior had not occurred since the two week suspension. In most of the tickets, I had some elongated conversations in which the support member said that they see that this offense should not have resulted in a permaban, but because I had a 2 week suspension prior on the account, that is why it lead to the permaban and that they could not reverse it.\r\n\r\nMany people who have encounters with Riot support know that they go by the script, and rarely ever look into context of the situation. I repeatedly explained that this was an isolated incident, and Riot support actually AGREED! The only problem being, they saw that I was right, agreed with me, but failed to act on it. The support members even claimed that if it were up to them, they wouldn't have thought to have permabanned me, but since it is not up to them, they can't reverse it.\r\n\r\nIn many of the tickets, I suggested I would do anything to get the account back, even suggesting a chat permaban. Seeing as how this would fix the so called \"toxic\" problem labeled on my account, this should've been more than enough reason to reverse the permaban. But none of them addressed my suggestion because they all knew it would solve it, but they had no power to do it.\r\n\r\nI never gave up, and kept submitting ticket after ticket, hoping that someone would be able to do something for me. I never expected this to happen, but this week, I submitted a ticket and the response I got were links to 4 suicide prevention websites. I never could've seen this happening!!! Not only did I not get a direct response to the ticket, but this person was throwing me away, like I didn't matter. \r\n\r\nWith a simple fix that I had so kindly suggested, I don't know why these tickets didn't get pushed up to higher authority for review, but rather I got the same response each time and eventually got ignored. Tickets like these that regard permabans should be looked into deeply with all context considered. They treated this like another random ticket and never truly seeked to help me.\r\n\r\nEven if people never get to the point of permaban, I know many people out there struggle with the faulty Riot support system. I truly hope that this post attracts the light of the League community because this is way more toxic than anything I have ever experienced in the game itself. The fact that Riot wouldn't install such a simple fix, but even went as far as disregarding my issue, and \"diagnosing\" me with suicide.\r\n\r\nI just want my account back, and for all those who struggle from this as well, I want my case to serve as an example so that justice can be served in the future. I am a loyal fan of 7 years to this game, and truly, this could not have made me any more disappointed. Reddit community, please serve the justice that Riot never could.","replies":[{"poster":"Hotarµ","date":"2020-02-29T04:43:43.507+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":3,"body":">I submitted many many support tickets, pleading that this was an isolated event and that they could even check my history to see that negative behavior had not occurred since the two week suspension. \n\n It _wasn't_ an isolated incident especially if you were already at the point where you received a 2 week suspension.\n \n It takes anywhere from 1 to 3+ months for an account's punishment level to start decaying (and that's with neutral or good behavior, negative behavior will halt your progress even if it isn't enough to warrant a punishment of it's own.)

When you get a 14-day suspension, Riot tells you to shape up or ship out. You chose the latter. That's not an \"unjust permaban\" at all; it's perfectly valid.

I hope we can keep this conversation constructed. I appreciate this debate. Everything you said isn't wrong. I guess it's open to interpretation. Since you use the speeding analogy, I will use it as well.\n\nRiot has set rules in place about chat and toxic language, just like there is a speed limit. If the speed limit is 40, it is usually appropriate to go 5-10 over the limit so 45-50mph. There is some flex room to say that you are going over the limit, but it is still acceptable. Like in my scenario, where I use some language, but I'd say it wasn't excessive and over the top that would warrant anything.\n\nBut say you catch an officer on a bad day, and he pulls you over for going 8 mph over. That is the situation I'm in now. Teammates in my game had a bad time and decided to report me over something they disagreed on. Is the ticket really worth ticketing? Is the account really worth permabanning? Well the officer is gonna write me the ticket, and I am gonna get permabanned.\n\nBut afterwards, I go to the judge and appeal my ticket and he says, oh, this is not a school zone and you really weren't speeding that bad. There was no harmful intent, not like you were going 100mph in a 40 zone. Not like I attacked someone in my game. Literally just using some language which is normal. I wasn't even saying stuff that would be considered toxic!\n\nIn the end, did I break the rules? Sure you can say I did, I can't necessarily deny that. I used phrase like \"r*t*rd\". But did I use it in a way that was meant to attack someone, in the sense of toxicity? No, absolutely not. Did it need to be a permaban? Absolutely not! And that's what I'm asking for. I'm genuinely asking for someone to stop reading the script, and analyze this case, which they clearly did, but failed to act on.\n\nAt the end of the day, you might still not agree with me. But the most important question to answer is: Did I really violate a rule that was so serious that should result in a permaban?\n\nPermabans should be reserved for those who intentionally cheat, int, or people that say legit hate crime level stuff about race, ethnicity, and berating people to the point of suicide. And honestly, this whole tribunal process has been more toxic to me than I could ever be to someone in the game just because the system is so ignorant to research each case and make the RIGHT human decision.","replies":[{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2020-02-29T13:02:55.050+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"You have to keep in mind that you've been consistently going over the speed limit and caught, warned and even charged multiple times. \n\nBeing a repeat offender  is the reason you've been permabanned.\n\nJust to let you know. Asking for reports is considered as a harassment and we've seen plenty of people get punished for asking for reports.\n\nIn fact, there is no need to ask for reports. 1 report does the same thing as 9 reports. All a report does is to flag the system to review the game. The toxicity score returned from the review will be the same regardless of how many times a player was reported within the same game.

That's your problem - you think that \"so long as it's not 'extreme' it's okay\". It's not. The rules are in place for a reason. You not understanding why the rules are in place doesn't mean they're wrong, nor does it mean you can violate them, even a \"little bit\" (or 5-10 mph). You may *avoid* being pulled over because the cops are overworked, but \"it was only 5mph\" won't fly with a judge (trust me, I've tried just that).\n\nThe benefit of an automated system is there is no \"bad day\". It applies the rules exactly the same to all players. There is no chance of a \"bad day\" for the automated system - it will treat you the same yesterday as it does today as it does tomorrow.\n\nThe judge will not say \"well, you were only going 5 over, thus you weren't violating the rules\". They'll say \"you were going 5 over, and you've been warned about this before, so this is appropriate\".\n\nThis is the crux of the issue - you were told \"follow the rules to the letter\" and you still didn't get that. You kept speeding - even if it was only 5-10 mph over. And you got caught. You're free to disagree, but the vast majority of the community doesn't want to see toxicity of the type in your chat logs. You were given your chance to improve, and you didn't. So unfortunately, Riot doesn't give you more chances. Because more chances would most likely mean you ruin more games before ending up in the ultimate position of a permaban.\n\nYou were told with your 14 day ban that it was your final chance. You screwed up and ended up with a permaban. Over 95% of people in your position would continue this behavior if they were given another chance. Even if you're in the 5% that wouldn't, Riot can't apply special rules to you - they must apply them equally. Meaning to give you one more chance, 19 or more other players would get another chance and ruin more games. That's not acceptable.\n\n****\nPost script: I appreciate your willingness to have a constructive discussion here, and I think that now that you've experienced this, you may very well have no problems on a new account.

The closest thing you could even consider \"toxic\" is when I say \"jung diff\", and if you consider that toxic, then maybe you shouldn't be judging people because that's not toxic whatsoever.\n\nEXHIBIT B:\n[All]phammer16: No\n[All]phammer16: norms\nphammer16: can yall listen\nphammer16: we recalled so stop fightin\nphammer16: group bot\nphammer16: CMON\nphammer16: Wasting baron\nphammer16: stop farming\nphammer16: Lets go\nphammer16: kindred idk why u reclaled\nphammer16: He had ult for the entrie team\nphammer16: why fight\nphammer16: when im not there\nphammer16: dont brah me\nphammer16: i was getting red\nphammer16: and you're in their jung for no reason\nphammer16: RED BUFF\nphammer16: How bout u gusy let me make the call\nphammer16: IDK why we went for baron instead of their inhib\nphammer16: Jax wass top side\nphammer16: shouldn't have dont baron to begin with\nphammer16: Whoever the fuck is pinging\nphammer16: stop pinging\nphammer16: Let me make the fucking calls\nphammer16: NOBODY SI BOT I GOT IT\nphammer16: for the last time\nphammer16: whoever the fuck is pinging\nphammer16: stop pinging\nphammer16: ffs\nphammer16: this kindred and sett are too heavy\nphammer16: walk together\nphammer16: set up vision\nphammer16: SETT\n[All]phammer16: GG\n[All]phammer16: R%%%%% sett\n[All]phammer16: This team man\n[All]phammer16: Fucking report jung and top plz\n[All]phammer16: Kindred fucking top lane lmfao\n[All]phammer16: Report jung top\n\nAgain, normal conversation/argumentation, nothing out of the ordinary here.

But again, if you think this is targeting someone, then maybe you shouldn't be judging chat logs at all. I was not in any way attacking this person. I was simply a statement of anger at the end of the game. After reviewing this chat log with the Riot support members, they even said \"Again, I agree that this is not permaban worthy as a first offense but because of the escalation, a permaban was warranted.\" This member was very helpful in analyzing the context of the scenario. He understood that nothing was meant of the situation. Additionally, they also said \"Trust me, if there was any wiggle room here to get your account back I would take it.\" This indicates that the member has successfully analyzed the situation and the chat logs, and even sides with me.

While it may be common to see this kind of argument, that does not mean that the behavior is okay. Your speeding analogy is not a good argument in your favor, because cops in smaller towns pull people over for going 5-10 mph over the speed limit all the time, because they have less to do. They have the time and resources to devote to catching even those who only break the law in minor ways. Riot's automated system is the same. They can catch those who make minor infractions when they're on their last chance. \n\nAdditionally, your level of negativity in the chat logs you provided was not minor.
