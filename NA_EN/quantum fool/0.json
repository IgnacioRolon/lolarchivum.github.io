Well, let's try the executables in the RADS folder. Two choices:\n - For me, it's at \"C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\RADS\\projects\\lol_launcher\\releases\\0.0.1.68\\deploy\", and the filename is \"LoLLauncher.exe\"\n - The other option is \"C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\RADS\\projects\\league_client\\releases\\0.0.0.129\\deploy\", and the filename is \"LeagueClient.exe\"\n\nFor both, try running as admin. Also, before trying each one, verify that there is no LoL process running in Task Manager (you get there with Ctrl+Shift+Esc)\n\n(note: the numbers in the above folders, should always be the latest ones available to you, at the time)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"AnataBakka","date":"2018-03-09T13:12:39.652+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"i sometimes have the same problem if i open the client and then open the browser.

I have LeagueClient.exe running as administrator, and lol.launcher.admin.exe does not exist for me. This is getting very frustrating since it was working fine before the 8.5 patch.","replies":[]}]}
