At first you're super competitive and climb the ladder, but we don't also want to put everything on the line for a fun game. Sometimes it's way more fun to let loose and not be so competitive. \n\nFirst and foremost, you could simply keep playing matches until your rank/MMR adjusts to where you're more comfortable. But of course, that could take some time tbh. You could also create a new account if you don't mind starting new since that would give you a fresh start and a fresh MMR for that new account.","replies":[{"poster":"Spected","date":"2017-09-18T18:22:03.713+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Heya thanks for your response :) i have been thinking about that but i have too much skins to be like yeah lets not use those 100s of euro's anymore haha and uhm yeah... atm im still gaining MMR with every win LUL xD so that is sooo not helping me either :'(\n\nI guess i just have to stop playing or just hope to keep losing hehe (which is not fun to have as future plans XD)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Spected","date":"2017-09-23T18:56:19.760+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do i have to call this bad luck or what?\n[Bad Luck](https://i.gyazo.com/1a23468a4982454c46574be0d76b2167.png)","replies":[]}]}
