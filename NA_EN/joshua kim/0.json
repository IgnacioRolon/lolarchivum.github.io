Help!!!","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So I finished a Windows 10 update on the morning of 08/19/16. I started a game of League but noticed that the client was very slow, so I restarted the client. I then proceeded to start a game and entered champion select. However, it just completely froze and I had to restart the client again. I then started another game and this time champion select was fine. I proceeded to enter the game but at 8 seconds, the whole computer froze. My sound had a \"bzzzzzz\" noise the entire time until I manually shut down my computer. I restarted my computer and had to try another game. Once again, within 15 seconds, the entire computer froze with the \"bzzzz\" noise. This was extremely frustrating since I have not changed a single thing about my computer other than the Windows 10 update. I uninstalled the game and reinstalled it but same thing occured.\n\nI've since tried custom games and my game crashes within 5-15 seconds of entering the game. The moment I move the cursor it almost immediately crashes, but even if I don't move the cursor or hit ESC, it will crash by itself anyways. I noticed the FPS is usually around 20 (it usually is around 60-70). The \"bzzzzz\" sound always occurs even though I don't have any background noise. I suspect this may be due to memory overload, but I don't know enough about computers to tell. As I've said before, everything was 100% fine until the Windows 10 update on 08/19/16.\n\nAnyways that's all I have to say about my situation. I've followed all the tips given on the Riot Support site. I appreciate any help.\n\nSpecs:\n-OS: Windows 10\n- Manufacturer: ASUSTek\n- Model: X555LAB Signature Edition\n- Processor: Intel Core i3-5010U CPU @ 2.10GHz\n- RAM: 4.00 GB\n-System type: 64-bit, x64 based operator\n","replies":[{"poster":"Nightm√£re","date":"2016-08-25T05:23:22.779+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"same happened for me , hope the solution gets announced or posted at the top so more people can see! {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-24T23:04:34.030+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you may be seeing adverse effects due to the windows anniversary update that enabled Xbox Game DVR.
