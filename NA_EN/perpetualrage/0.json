My audio (in game and out game) crackles and stutters, opening and loading things takes longer or freezes my pc for a few seconds. In game my fps has dropped from near 120 constant to 1--40, usually around 20-30, but spikes to what feels like below 1 fps. At the moment it is bordering unplayable, any suggestions or ideas on whats causing this?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-30T23:04:21.923+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We've noticed some issues with [**in-game FPS after patch 7.22**](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/lZv6E2Xz-update-on-fps-issues-in-722-and-723), but this kinda seems more related to either your pc having problems running league due to specs or the client files being damaged. Try running a quick repair to check up on those files and let me know if that helps at all.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Insidious","date":"2017-11-30T08:42:18.275+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This has been happening to me and a bounty of other people.
