Every first auto roots his target and deals decent bonus damage, his E can do good damage when stacked and it slows, a massive shield that helps him survive like a Leona, and one of the best ults in the game. Point and click and knocks everybody up in it's path. There's a reason he's called the king of cc and despite being tank, he deals decent damage.\n\nWhile his Hook isnt as strong as Blitz's, it is safer to use in worse case scenarios where you hooked someone you didnt want like a Rammus. With Naut, at least his hooks wont pull a Rammus directly into your team. \n\nBlitz is better when your team is snowballing but almost useless when its the other way around. Naut is just better across the board.","replies":[]},{"poster":"WitchQueen Annie","date":"2017-01-27T09:52:51.118+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"so why is Blitzcrank have a higher win rate at pro play AND has a higher rating on most websites that rank champion tiers?\n\nI'm just wondering because intuitively it seems that Naut is better from my point of view as well. He has more CC, he doesn't NEED to land his hook (he has a point and click AOE R) and his hook is more reliable (longer ranger, faster speed, easier to aim). Blitz has 1 ability that isn't very useful if he didn't land his hook (his W) while all of Nautilus' abilities can be used in combat assuming he's front-lining.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Maximum Morde","date":"2017-01-25T12:43:47.898+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Blitzcrank.

Blitz is useless if he has no Q, and if you can predict it then he can't even do anything. Naut just has way more in his kit, and unlike Blitzcrank he can peel decently.","replies":[]}]}
