As a result of its placement, if you have something protruding specifically from the coccyx without any change in its location and it's not covered by your pants, you're either an inner-city gangster or your pants are too low. If something was to protrude from the coccyx, it would likely go under or through the skirt, and, by necessity, would probably call for a wraparound skirt instead of one that would be pulled up, to prevent frustration and be faster with tails as large and fluffy as Ahri's. Though you could easily just pull something up to that tail joint without a problem, you're not going to be able to get above it very easily (important for a coccyx tail), which may or may not be important depending upon the exact location of origin for the tail(s) - and various media do depict tails, even in humanoids, coming from slightly different locations, meaning to properly cover it you'd need to either just drape something over, like a robe, or pull up to it and hope it's considered decent in polite society.
