This never happens unless you play with a friend or if you're not low elo (unlike me :'( ).\nTop lane he shits on the likes of Riven and Yasuo because they want to trade with you but don't realize it doesn't work.\nFor the builds, since he scales off of too many things, you can go full ap, full tank or in between. The best is to go in between toplane and full ap botlane (or mid if you're into that). Full tank is kind of a waste since you don't have cc, so you won't do anything for your team (no damage and 0 utility. Yes, the W heal isn't an utility if you play tank).","replies":[{"poster":"Ahristocats","date":"2017-06-06T20:13:54.812+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"i'm sure you do not even know the reason he went botlane\n\nand still dare to talk about his rework","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Phazanor ","date":"2017-06-08T17:47:03.316+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Janna X RubicK,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=qEj1J2oT,comment-id=000500000002,timestamp=2017-06-06T20:13:54.812+0000)\n>\n> i&#x27;m sure you do not even know the reason he went botlane\n> \n> and still dare to talk about his rework\n\nApart from \"we want to break the meta\"?\nGo on, enlighten me.","replies":[{"poster":"Ahristocats","date":"2017-06-08T18:57:16.994+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it has NOTHING to do with breaking the meta\n\nany veteran player would know how old morde was IMPOSSIBLE to balance in solo lane\nold morde sololane match ups were all decided in selection, or by jungle presence\n\nmorde cannot work in solo lane except if his identity changes heavily (his identity was and is right now, slow moving billion of damage no cc champion) \nif you give him the tools to work alone, then his kit becomes imbalanced as his billion of damage will be reliable\nif however he should work with a support, then you can outplay his support and win against him, and then mordekaiser match ups become all skilled match ups\n\ncertainlyt already explained all of this, and there is a reason the design leader allowed him to do that, because **it makes sense**\n\nmordekaiser today is strong in duo lane, and was picked multiple time in competition in botlane in 2017\nthere is a challenger adc mordekaiser main (tastypotatox)","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Phazanor ","date":"2017-06-11T15:56:28.232+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Janna X RubicK,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=qEj1J2oT,comment-id=00050000000200000000,timestamp=2017-06-08T18:57:16.994+0000)\n>\n> it has NOTHING to do with breaking the meta\n> \n> any veteran player would know how old morde was IMPOSSIBLE to balance in solo lane\n> old morde sololane match ups were all decided in selection, or by jungle presence\n> \n> morde cannot work in solo lane except if his identity changes heavily (his identity was and is right now, slow moving billion of damage no cc champion) \n> if you give him the tools to work alone, then his kit becomes imbalanced as his billion of damage will be reliable\n> if however he should work with a support, then you can outplay his support and win against him, and then mordekaiser match ups become all skilled match ups\n> \n> certainlyt already explained all of this, and there is a reason the design leader allowed him to do that, because **it makes sense**\n> \n> mordekaiser today is strong in duo lane, and was picked multiple time in competition in botlane in 2017\n> there is a challenger adc mordekaiser main (tastypotatox)\n\nAre you a pre-rework Mordekaiser veteran? You played him for 5 years?\nHis kit was unbalanceable, yes, that's why he was reworked. They changed his vfx to smoke (instead of metal) and put a chunk of his power budget in duo lane and dragon gimmicks. The point isn't him being strong, it's CT changing a champion identity despite the heavy backlash of the community.\nAlso, I'd like a source on \"it has NOTHING to do with breaking the meta\", since most things I read (from rioters) mention wanting to try to break the meta with that rework.\nEdit: and the fact he's the only Juggernaut who needs an allies' cc or 2 cc items (or a braindead enemy) to deal his damage. All the others have a way of inflicting their damage (Garen speed, Darius slows and pull, etc).","replies":[{"poster":"Ahristocats","date":"2017-06-11T16:03:17.599+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you should actually thanks certainlyt because if it weren't him mordekaiser identity would have changed to be viable in solo lane\nct didn't change his identity, and made his identity balanced because only in duo lane it can be balanced\n\nyou actually ignored all my explination \n\nhttps://i.gyazo.com/75aa6ab4bd7d334a3b73612cc3d32ea7.png\n\nhttps://i.gyazo.com/ca8bb44c60a1a41e0825d2f491193825.png\n\ni'm going to leave this here\nand if you want to keep the arguing\n\nyou should tell me why certainlyt wasn't right, because all high elo players agreed with him in 2015 about mordekaiser being impossible to balance in solo lane, someone who has no cc, no mobility, the highest damage output in melee range cannot work in solo lane except if he's broken like pre-rework morde\n\nthat's just a fact","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Phazanor ","date":"2017-06-13T08:20:39.074+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Janna X RubicK,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=qEj1J2oT,comment-id=0005000000020000000000000000,timestamp=2017-06-11T16:03:17.599+0000)\n>\n> you should actually thanks certainlyt because if it weren&#x27;t him mordekaiser identity would have changed to be viable in solo lane\n> ct didn&#x27;t change his identity, and made his identity balanced because only in duo lane it can be balanced\n> \n> you actually ignored all my explination \n> \n> https://i.gyazo.com/75aa6ab4bd7d334a3b73612cc3d32ea7.png\n> \n> https://i.gyazo.com/ca8bb44c60a1a41e0825d2f491193825.png\n> \n> i&#x27;m going to leave this here\n> and if you want to keep the arguing\n> \n> you should tell me why certainlyt wasn&#x27;t right, because all high elo players agreed with him in 2015 about mordekaiser being impossible to balance in solo lane, someone who has no cc, no mobility, the highest damage output in melee range cannot work in solo lane except if he&#x27;s broken like pre-rework morde\n> \n> that&#x27;s just a fact\n\nThen rework Annie to be only playable in a duo lane.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"WitchQueen Annie","date":"2017-06-06T17:46:49.097+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So do I build ANY tank items in the build or just go 5 AP items and Sorc Boots?

You don't want Morello because it has Mana, you don't want to freeze yourself with a Zhonya when you're already so slow, etc. But since your durability is linked to the damage you deal with your spells, more CDR means more damage and more shield, so it's really a good stat to have. Getting your E back .5 s earlier and get 50% shield from it can often be the difference between life and death.\n\nI also disagree with the previous post that says you can go anything from full AP to full Tank. Full Tank is horrible, you need at least 2 damage items in a full build. But you should consider some Tank items, especially if the enemy team is also tanky and you can't hope to burst them. Good items to consider are: Spirit Visage, for the increased healing on your W + CDR, Deadman for the movespeed+slow it gives. You can also opt-in for any of the MR+10% CDR if you situationally need them, including Abyssal since you deal mostly Magic damage.\n\nAll the hybrid AP/Defense items are also interesting, especially since most of them also give CDR. Protobelt is HP+Mobility, Banshee is MR+a spell shield that can block a critical CC and let you engage, Zhonya is a bit less enticing but still decent in some situation. Rylai/Liandry also have a decent amount of HP and good synergy with your kit.\n\nAlso, don't forget Sterak and Gunblade, you have decent AD ratios, and the highest base AD in the whole game, so you can actually benefit quite a lot from those 2 items. (I've also seen people going for a Trifroce once in a while, since it also works from base AD, but I personally would not recommend that, it's a super niche item for Morde.)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mordepool","date":"2017-06-06T20:14:51.641+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's harder to get CDR in builds.
