Not the best adc, but not the worst either. Hes usually a safe pick, used in specific situations. Like I will only pick {{champion:81}}  against squishier team comps. {{champion:81}}  is NOT a tank buster. So if the enemy team has say {{champion:201}} , {{champion:122}}  and {{champion:254}} .....then stay away from {{champion:81}} . Hes a solid pick.....but pay attention to enemy team comp when deciding to play him or not","replies":[]},{"poster":"paisy","date":"2017-02-04T16:48:49.667+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He's always a decent pick","replies":[]},{"poster":"Proxy345","date":"2017-02-04T09:01:53.480+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:21}} >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>{{champion:81}}  right now lol","replies":[]},{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2017-02-04T08:54:48.570+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He's normally picked as a safety net pick/pocket pick.
