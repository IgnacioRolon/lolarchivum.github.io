Intentionally feeding breaches the competitive and sportsmanlike environment that we&#039;re trying to cultivate and can ruin the game not just for your team, but for the other team as well who just want to play a normal, competitive, fair game.\n\n**In this case, I have personally reviewed your game with my team and we&#039;re going to have to say that the suspension was justified.**\n\nKeep in mind that this two week suspension will put your account in a dire state and any further instances of negativity (no matter how small) will result in a permanent suspension.\n\nWhile I won&#039;t be able to help with the account further, if you have any other questions, feel free to let me know. Otherwise, I will be closing the ticket out soon.\n\ndeme lovato\nriot games player support\ndiana main&quot;_\n\nSO RIOT DEME PERSONALLY REVIEWED MY GAME, AND SAYS THAT IT WAS AN INTING GAME.\nME 1v1-ing the FED DIAMOND 5 VAYNE AT 33 mins AND TRADED KILLS IS STILL INTING.\n**SO THE POINT IS, LOSING LANE IS INTING.\nTHANKS RIOT, FOR TAKING MY HONOR 4 AWAY.**\n\n_**EDIT: 10/29/2017 5:47AM**_\n\nIt's past my account's punishment date, and I am unable to download the replay as the current patch\nisn't compatible with the other patch back in 10/12/2017, which I assume was 7.20.\nThere's not much I can do to prove that I was not inting beside you guys looking at the game's stats.\nI can just try to explain my early game.\n\n===========\nDeath #1 - Big level 1 fight, caused 6 deaths. I killed Lee Sin.\nDeath #2 - Tp back in lane and literally loss the 1v1 right away\nDeath #3 - Walked to lane then got 1v1'ed\nDeath #4 - I got ganked\n\nOrnn Overstayed and I tp'ed back in lane and killed him\nDeath #5 - I overstayed and after he tp, he killed me. I didn't expect him to be immune to my W. Aka first time fighting him in lane.\n\nDeath #6 - I got dove by Ornn, he was strong enough to tank the tower and kill me.\nDeath #7 - I was getting dove by Lee Sin AND Ornn but my team counter gank. I killed Lee Sin and Ornn killed us 3, Zed, Tahm and I.\nDeath #8 - I outplayed Lee Sin and killed Lee Sin, but Zed and I died to Ornn\n\nThis early game should be enough for you guys to believe I'm not Inting at all.\nIf you guys don't believe me, you shouldn't even read this.\nThat's all I'm gonna explain for my first 8 deaths.\nThe rest are just late game fights and split pushing deaths.\n\nLike c'mon, I even 1v1'ed a D5 Vayne who was way more fed then I was at around 34 mins.","replies":[]}
