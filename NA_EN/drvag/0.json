A friend of mine has a problem connecting to the server. Thing is that he cannot enter his email to in order to just change his password. I checked and some other guys had the same problem 5 months ago. The only difference is that the could at least connect to the lol's site. He cannot.. Is there any chance that we can speak to a league o legends representative  so he can give you his phone number and send him his password or maybe another way that i don't know of? He tried reinstalling and nothing change. Let me hear your thoughts. Thank you in advance!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-19T23:11:56.506+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, it would be best for us to help out your friend directly with his account.
