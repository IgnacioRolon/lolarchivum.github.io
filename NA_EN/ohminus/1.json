I think he's among the top 5 almost certainly.\n\nForgiven... on mechanics alone, I'd put him in the top 5 easily. But as an overall player, his arrogance tends to be his downfall, so I think your placement makes sense. He makes plays with disregard for his team, and has caused several teams to completely self-destruct. I doubt this year will be any different for him. \n\nAside from that, I think you've got a pretty good list here.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TBakes","date":"2016-09-22T01:56:34.013+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"GBM ranks the players:\nhttp://www.thescoreesports.com/lol/news/10481-ranked-by-mom-gbm-picks-his-top-5-players-at-worlds-in-each-role","replies":[]},{"poster":"Takito","date":"2016-09-17T00:54:21.290+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Zven should really be lower.He isn't bad, but he isn't that good.\n\nI would say \n\n7.Sneaky\n8.Doublelift\n9.Zven\n(I could put them a little higher maybe, but i don't know Ruler,Jinjiao and Deft so yeah...)\n\nStixay a lot lower too, he really wasn't that great all summer split.","replies":[{"poster":"Ciller","date":"2016-09-19T11:03:46.912+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Zven was the only thing that had OG doing good at all when OG was struggling, and he's one of the mains carries that G2 goes to, since Perkz is unreliable, and Expect is pretty bad, but can carry if he's fed the resources.","replies":[{"poster":"Takito","date":"2016-09-19T17:56:40.379+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Being the only thing good on a bad team doesn't make you better than other adc...\n\nLike i said, he is good for sure, but clearly not better than Sneaky or Doublelift.Not sure about forgiven...Would be a close one IMO, but since G2 got 1st EU and H2K second, i'll go with zven ahead of Forgiven.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Linthe","date":"2016-09-19T17:16:18.976+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea, Im not sure Bang is #1 anymore..
