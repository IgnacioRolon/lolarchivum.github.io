So I decided to ask the boards for a new main. \n\nWhat does this mean? It means I might be dooming myself, but hey that's fine. \n\nPick my main, Here are the choices: LITERALLY ANYTHING! META OR OFF-META!\n\nPick a champion and a role. I don't care what champion in what role. Just put your vote in the comments, if you see a vote you like then upvote it. The comment with the most upvotes by Friday the 9th at 7:00 Pm EST will be my new main. (**You do not get to decide my build**)\n\nAt that time I will be streaming my ~~failures~~ successes over at https://www.twitch.tv/doomlad1 \n\n","replies":[{"poster":"Wukong X Ahri","date":"2016-09-07T23:19:34.791+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://i.imgur.com/5buMa.gif?noredirect\n\nCome on peeps we need more Hue mains!","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-09-08T20:23:46.878+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hue","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Reaper Soraka","date":"2016-09-09T00:26:28.132+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you want fun you obviously have to play support.\nIf you want super fun you obviously need to play a squishy support.\nIf you want to be crazy, use all the colors!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Papa Slothy","date":"2016-09-09T00:23:26.305+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"full AP {{champion:36}}  mid lane\n\nlate game you can shred through squishies....sometimes","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-09-07T23:18:23.995+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:103}}  ADC. \nSurprisingly viable.","replies":[{"poster":"Bemapon","date":"2016-09-08T11:12:39.118+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I tried that a long time ago, would have gotten a penta if my jungler didnt take it, lol","replies":[{"poster":"Terabyte Marine","date":"2016-09-08T12:53:40.691+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wasn't I playing {{champion:99}} jungle as well?","replies":[{"poster":"Bemapon","date":"2016-09-08T23:35:38.917+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah...
