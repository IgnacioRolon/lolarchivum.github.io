Not even after being spoken to by a king? Allright, I&rsquo;ll tell you who ~~the servants~~ we are. \r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://media.lolusercontent.com/api/embedly/1/image/resize?url=http%3A%2F%2Fimgur.com%2FSfOkGBO.png&amp;key=a45e967db0914c7fb472fd4381e6c85b&amp;width=425\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Runeterran Brigade is an open Discord community who are willing to accept people from all over League.  We love fun stuff, so if you are sweet we will allow you to dwell among us. \r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://media.lolusercontent.com/api/embedly/1/image/resize?url=http%3A%2F%2Fimgur.com%2Fsx0g8fa.png&amp;key=a45e967db0914c7fb472fd4381e6c85b&amp;width=425\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat we want to bring to you are movie nights, anime nights, karaoke nights, (Still don&rsquo;t know who the f*ck thought this up.), share dank memes, talking, roleplaying, and coaching, which is very important because it is last. \r\n\r\n\r\nSo, should you like the ideas of this, feel free to read the rules. Below that you can find the way to contact us. \r\n\r\n\r\nOfficial Rules of Order and Conduct for the Runeterran Brigade Discord. Please abide by these rules, or actions will be made against you.\r\nRULES:\r\n1. Don&#039;t jump into a full league game speech group if you are not in the game yourself.\r\n2. Listen to Officers according to authority. General/OOC officers for general issues or out-of-rp issues, RP Officers for RP specific issues, and if they&#039;re both, then well both.\r\n3. Don&#039;t be disrespectful, rude, or offensive unless it&#039;s an obvious joke.\r\n4. Put any song you like into general chat only.\r\n5. Always refer to each other as their &quot;character&quot; in general chat, unless told otherwise (like they are several characters, for example.)\r\n6. Do not kill each other unless explicitly given permission. Maiming or seriously injuring is fine.\r\nPUNISHMENT TIERS:\r\n1. Warning by the higher ups, punishments are not to go unlogged by other staff. More information on that for staff coming soon.\r\n2. Warning, and possible demotion of rank (aka, block from certain RP&#039;s)\r\n3. Final warning, and suspended from talking. You can read and keep up with the chats while you are gone, but you have no permission to speak in any voice call or chat until your suspension is lifted. Average time is 2 days, will extend if severe enough.\r\n4. Kick from the server.\r\n~\r\nRP SPECIFIC RULES:\r\n1. Keep any more intimate reactions limited strictly to kissing MAX, nothing more than that. You can mention that &quot;the deed&quot; was done, but no details or vivid descriptions, no matter how ambigious they are.\r\n2. Your nickname should be in the following format: -Character you RP as (LoL IGN)-\r\n3. It is not our job to tell you how to get out of a situation, asking for suggestions etc is fine, but not asking for us to figure out stuff for you otherwise. Open rp is meant to be fun but you have to be clever and know your opponent/yourself as well. We can&#039;t tell you how to play your own character.\r\n4. Do not talk out of character in the RP chats. Please keep that to #rp-discussion and #general\r\n5. NPCing will only be allowed after 15 minutes of inactivity from a user that is postponing the RP without a direct reason. (For example, if you clarify you&#039;ll be gone for 30 minutes to go to the store, and people are fine with waiting or working around your character without NPCing them, then fine,) but if you leave randomly for 15+ minutes, they have the right to NPC your character.\r\n6. Joining a RP that is having an event going on is not allowed without explicit permission from the people involved. (If they&#039;re like, walking down the road alone to go to the training room or something, then obviously you can approach them,) but if they are in a situation, for example, a fighting scene, randomly joining can cause issues.\r\nROLEPLAYING FORMAT:\r\n1. Normal talk that does not have to do with the RP with potentially some IRL elements\r\n2. &quot;Dialogue in the RP&quot;\r\n3. actions in the RP\r\n4. (Questions directed at the RP)\r\n5. &lt;thoughts your character is having in the rp&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThese people below can be contacted through Discord.\r\nAtty#7304\r\nHades#1973\r\nRaiku-Kawisa#9721\r\nShadow_ Dash454#8929\r\nDarkenedAuras#5227\r\nRumble (TheTarians)#3728\r\nThe ~~goddess~~ boss&rsquo; IGN is VenturaThePoro, she&rsquo;ll be making room in her friends list for people, but if you want a quick response, please DM on Discord, since she&#039;s max friends and might miss you by accident.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy Summoner&rsquo;s name is Mad King Hades, feel free to befriend me if you think you can stand annoying, obnoxious, and madness. \r\nDiscord Link: https://discord.gg/jm7P363\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo, any questions?

Just remember, everyone meets me eventually, why postpone it?\r\nhttp://orig14.deviantart.net/08ad/f/2014/027/3/c/hades____by_saraforlenza-d73z6e9.jpg","replies":[{"poster":"SlntReaper","date":"2016-10-28T00:06:04.302+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I should join\nkappa","replies":[]},{"poster":"macromite","date":"2016-10-27T18:14:34.021+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You should totally add me, oh wait.","replies":[]}]}
