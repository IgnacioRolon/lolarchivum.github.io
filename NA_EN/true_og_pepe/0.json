But ranked is a different story. it almost seems pointless climbing in ranked because the higher i go the more toxic it gets. i am currently in silver 1 and if the enemy gets first blood my teammate would either flame or give up.  its become so bad that every game i have to /mute all which i hate doing because i want to communicate with my team. some to most of the flame is racial slurs or demotivating comments and if i report it nothng happens. its really sad \r\n\r\nsorry but i feel as if i needed to make this statement because nothing is being done about it","replies":[{"poster":"enshine","date":"2019-08-08T05:49:13.473+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"it's no different from any other video game \"\"community\"\" lmfao \n\nyou ever play modern warfare 2?\n\nworld of warcraft? \n\ngames in league are just much longer, which makes negativity bias even stronger","replies":[{"poster":"Zorpinka","date":"2019-08-09T00:42:25.363+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=enshine,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=5Bc4gHxq,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2019-08-08T05:49:13.473+0000)\n>\n> it's no different from any other video game \"\"community\"\" lmfao \n> \n> you ever play modern warfare 2?\n> \n> world of warcraft? \n> \n> games in league are just much longer, which makes negativity bias even stronger\n\nHe didn't say it was any different aside from its' worse.

No other game has a chat system so toxic they permaban other players. You cannot get banned from hearthstone because theres no chat. Toxic players dont get chat taken away from them but rather just all of they're skins and time because Riot as a shitty company absorbs all of that. If you are feeling that the game is toxic don't spend money on skins as you will inevitably be driven to say something back to a \"toxic\" player that will be considered \"toxic\" itself. There is nothing wrong with flaming back as nobody truely gets hurt from arguing however Riots intent is to actually convince these players that they are wrong and to buy more skins on theyre new accounts. It may take being a victim to this scheme yourself to understand it but the main idea is that Riot is initiating a blame game among players to prove who is more\"toxic\" by theyre standards \n\nhttps://gyazo.com/650631f0815e92065aca2430ae55e750","replies":[{"poster":"CharDeeMcDenniz","date":"2019-08-08T11:21:15.949+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"so if this is just a league problem why are companies like Blizzard teaming up with them to fight the same problem?\n\nhttps://www.pcgamer.com/major-game-companies-are-teaming-up-to-combat-toxicity-in-gaming/\n\nover 30 major companies are also teaming up to fight toxicity because *gasp* **ITS NOT JUST A LEAGUE ISSUE!**\n\nhttp://fairplayalliance.org/\n\ni understand that you're salty for whatever reason but spamming misinformation is just silly","replies":[{"poster":"açid","date":"2019-08-08T12:49:34.211+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Because other company's do the same thing. \"Toxicity\" doesn't exist just people like you who want to play victim.

Riot has been lax about this stuff for YEARS. It's exactly the same punishments it was in season 2 and the behavior has only gotten worse. They don't care.
