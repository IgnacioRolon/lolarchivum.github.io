In fact, the thing we have issue with is \"Power without Gameplay,\" less so \"Invisible Power.\" They're fairly similar concepts, but PWG is more concrete.\n\nAs a jungler, I make a conscious choice with my Smites. Players choose which camps to start at based upon the Smite rewards. There's gameplay with every single jungle Smite buff gained. And in fact, only one of them has meaningful impact with even a chance of being invisible (Gromp--the vision-related stuff is pretty clean in execution), and the rest is just extra meaningful decisions and gameplay for a jungler as they navigate the jungle.\n\nThere is no Armor/MR buff for the defending team. That never went live.\n\nThe Challenging Smite damage debuff is somewhat bundled in, that's true. You'd have to talk to a game designer about that one.\n\nSnowballing is bad ->\n\nThat's not really what we're saying. Our thrust is that a winning team should feel like they're winning and feel like they're making meaningful progress, but at the same time, the losing team should feel like they have ways to get back into the game. See, here's the thing about the new Dragon mechanic: The first buff is pretty good. Still, it's worth less in gold value than the gold of the old first Dragon. At any point during the game, the losing team can manage to claim one Dragon and gain that one really important buff for bonus AD/AP. The Dragon's only better than Baron if you managed to get FIVE of them (over a 30 minute span), without your opponent stealing any of them away from you (Add 6 minutes if that's the case). That's pretty damn fair. You get 30 minutes to try to stop Dragon control before the \"Better than Baron\" snowball.\n\nGames have to snowball to a certain extent, otherwise nothing matters and the game is just a coinflip in the end. Rather, we want to have a *healthy* amount of snowballing. There should be ways to come back, but building a lead should feel meaningful.\n\nFlat Armor/Magic Pen ->\n\nSure, it's still a problematic stat. But just because we've prioritized other things above that work and changes to it aren't ready yet, how is that hypocritical? It's not like we were like \"Yo dawg, let's add a bunch more flat pen items!\" Okay, yes I realize we put Brutalizer into the AD Jungle Enchantment, but that's still only coming in for a single champion (if that) each game.\n\nEnforcing the Meta ->\n\nReally nothing we've done enforces a requirement in how you play the game. We've seen people bring Smite and still head top lane because they want the Smite benefits and items. I wouldn't be surprised if a 5-Smite all lane team were totally viable, since the jungle respawns so slowly now. It's actually probably increased the ability for teams to run no jungler. Yes, the value of Dragon/Baron make bringing Smite into the game really valuable, but the way you do it is still up to the players and teams. And if we've so severely pushed champions into \"only being able to support others\" why is solo lane Lulu/Karma/Zilean/etc. still a thing? Some champions are TRUE protectors (Sona, Soraka for example) and so they naturally don't fit well in solo lanes, but that's no different from saying, \"Well, Annie's a bad Marksman, way to enforce the meta, Riot.\" Champions are good at different things. This is a GOOD thing. Otherwise, picking a champion is literally irrelevant.\n\nCounterplay ->\n\nFirst, item-based counterplay is not very interesting. One of the designers posted about Tenacity and Knockups a few days ago, if you want to look around for that.\n\nSecond, the thing is we've actually been INCREASING ability counterplay of the course of the game. On launch, what percentage of champions had point and click stuns? Literally, just put your cursor over someone, receive stun, no extra cost to you. Off the top of my head, I can think of Taric, Annie, Sion. You could make a case for Ryze... I can't think of any more right now. Almost 10% of the champion lineup had a literally zero-counterplay hard crowd control. Since then we've removed Sion's and added a whole bunch of other champions, lowering that percentage pretty severely. What, 2% now? Any champion that DID get targeted CC had some kind of drawback: Nocturne has to hold the tether. Malzahar has to safely channel. Vi is now inside the team and better be tanky enough to survive. Otherwise, every hard CC we add to the game can be dodged or has some kind of extra counter-playable requirement in order to receive the CC.\n\nAs for Kalista, it's not something I have the vocabulary or knowledge to talk about, so again, best saved for one of our game designers or CertainlyT himself.\n\nFinally, there's one more thing I want to bring up: Design is all about achieving a balance, about give and take. That's why finding an *appropriate* amount of snowballing is important. You can basically slide how much a lead matters up or down. Having too much or too litter are both really bad. You get the right amount. If you wanted 100% counterplay to everything you'd give everyone perfect vision of the map and no crowd control, because how can you counter-play when you can't move? Well, there's reasons to have CC. There's reasons to have some champions with more mobility than others. There's reasons and benefits (and drawbacks) to every decision you make in game design. It's about maximizing fun versus frustration.","replies":[{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2014-12-03T03:36:27.665+0000","up_votes":41,"down_votes":3,"body":"On one hand, I agree with most of your points, though I do think that Riot is underestimating how useful the first dragon is (don't have to go back to receive the benefit, scales).

The best way to shut down, say, a Yasuo, or an Akali, or Fizz, or Zed, is with CC. However, with the multiple dashes and other survival mechanisms, this means that they have an advantage. The skill there isn't so much 'how good the CCer is at landing skillshots', it's 'how bad is the person playing the dodgy champion'. Sure, it's fun to dodge the light binding and murder the Lux, but it's not so fun to have your one defense negated and then get facerolled on.\n\nI maintain that a certain amount of targetted CC should be in the game, entirely to deal with dodgy champions like those. Otherwise, you get Akali having a 55% win rate in diamond, and that'd be ridiculous.\n\nOh, wait.","replies":[{"poster":"Earl Eulrich","date":"2014-12-03T03:44:38.079+0000","up_votes":22,"down_votes":2,"body":"I can´t agree more here...the ironic thing is that actually those \"point&click stuns\" left from S1 are the only real counters to the mobility-creep.\nIt´s one of the reasons Maokai, Ryze and the likes have done so well in S4, as they can lock down the likes of Ahri reliably.","replies":[{"poster":"RoyaiChaos","date":"2014-12-03T05:02:34.640+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":0,"body":"I honestly feel like it comes full circle.

Plus, how many have AOE potential compared to point and click abilities.  On top of that, if most casters screw up their point and click ability (either hit a wrong target or use it at a bad time) they can be severely punished.  Due to the combination of range and cd on skillshots or just other factors in the kit, you really can't punish a number of skillshot reliant champs when they miss.\n\nThe only thing that gives the myth any relevance is that \"skill\" is in skillshot.  However, there's {{champion:115}} for example who has a ~2.5s cooldown on his main damage ability, ~11s cd on an ability that creates a 10s zone control area that can slow and deal damage to whoever goes through, and he has an escape that if used properly can also deal damage/knock back.

It has to a certain extent been balanced around to be necessary for every game. It is the most powerful of the 5 roles and if they get ahead can completely decimate weaker champions in an instant which leaves you feeling cheated just because one person gets stronger scaling auto attacks which is all they have to do to kill an opponent. everyone else has to rely on abilities and cooldowns in the late game.

The multiple Smites brought about a strategy of using dragon control to push the game faster at the expense of a team-fight summoner spell. It is also a problem we have faced in the past of the lack of diversity in summoner spells, where we finally had something to diversify Riot didn't want it, thus enforcing the standard meta on its players.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dunderflump","date":"2014-12-03T05:10:25.461+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Hi there,\n> \n> I figured I'd take a stab at some of your points here, since it's an interesting discussion, and you're clearly very passionate about it:\n> \n> Hidden Power ->\n> \n> Hidden Power is more along the lines of Taric's Shatter passive, Sona's old Q/W/E auras, Soraka's old passive, etc. It's stuff with zero gameplay, zero thought put into it, just purely power without gameplay. In fact, the thing we have issue with is \"Power without Gameplay,\" less so \"Invisible Power.\" They're fairly similar concepts, but PWG is more concrete.\n\nI would argue that while 'Power With Gameplay' is something that you should strive for in designing champions, carrying passive power isn't inherently bad unless it's unreadable or hidden. \n\nE.G. Kassadin's \"I take 15% less magic damage because fuck you\" vs. Soraka's \"I have 16 bonus MR because holy goat\". \n\nSoraka's strength was very clear and could be itemized/countered in a very obvious way. If she hadn't received a rework I would've advocated for some form of clear animation showing whom her passive was covering, but that's off-topic. To me, hidden power is one of the most -- I hate to use this phrase -- toxic types of gameplay. Hidden power is pen-maxed Veigar ulting a Kassadin and Kassadin surviving with 30 hp because Kassadin. Hidden power is fighting another jungler and suddenly -- and mysteriously -- losing the fight because you're taking a ton of true damage and you're doing -20% damage. *At least Exhaust is clear about it and has a long CD. * And due to the now-variable CD on Smite, you'll rarely even know if people have it up or not.\n\n> As a jungler, I make a conscious choice with my Smites. Players choose which camps to start at based upon the Smite rewards. There's gameplay with every single jungle Smite buff gained. And in fact, only one of them has meaningful impact with even a chance of being invisible (Gromp--the vision-related stuff is pretty clean in execution), and the rest is just extra meaningful decisions and gameplay for a jungler as they navigate the jungle.\n\nI have a strong dislike of the new jungle, particularly because of the buffs. I especially loathe the vision monsters because unless you're Nocturne you can do absolutely nothing about them. Sneak Barons/Dragons pretty much don't happen now because between warding/vision abilities/monster vision/dragon strength *someone* has vision 100% of the time. And for the team that's ahead it makes them even stronger because you can't deny them vision of the area.\n\n> There is no Armor/MR buff for the defending team. That never went live.\n\nI'm really glad that never made it in. I hated it the most out of all the changes.\n\n> The Challenging Smite damage debuff is somewhat bundled in, that's true. You'd have to talk to a game designer about that one.\n> \n> Snowballing is bad ->\n> \n> That's not really what we're saying. Our thrust is that a winning team should feel like they're winning and feel like they're making meaningful progress, but at the same time, the losing team should feel like they have ways to get back into the game. See, here's the thing about the new Dragon mechanic: The first buff is pretty good. Still, it's worth less in gold value than the gold of the old first Dragon. At any point during the game, the losing team can manage to claim one Dragon and gain that one really important buff for bonus AD/AP. The Dragon's only better than Baron if you managed to get FIVE of them (over a 30 minute span), without your opponent stealing any of them away from you (Add 6 minutes if that's the case). That's pretty damn fair. You get 30 minutes to try to stop Dragon control before the \"Better than Baron\" snowball.\n\nI don't feel like I have any way to get back into the game when my team's behind and the enemy team gets further ahead because of the 8% stat boost/movement speed/siege damage. Even if I manage to get/steal a dragon (which is really not easy anymore), that 8% does a lot less for my team than it's doing for them. If you're going to make dragon give permanent team-wide buffs, they should be smaller, but potentially stack for more? I don't feel the 8% ap/ad is a good thing to put on dragon because it's extremely punishing or rewarding based on teamcomp. Let's say we have a Mundo top and they have a Riven or a Fiora. That 8% does a ton more for them than it does for Mundo, or any other tank we choose to have. Hell, if we have 2 tanks (1 top, 1 jungle), then we're even worse off.\n\n> Games have to snowball to a certain extent, otherwise nothing matters and the game is just a coinflip in the end. Rather, we want to have a *healthy* amount of snowballing. There should be ways to come back, but building a lead should feel meaningful.\n\nAnd I agree with you, but I feel you've gone too far with it.\n\n> Flat Armor/Magic Pen ->\n> \n> Sure, it's still a problematic stat. But just because we've prioritized other things above that work and changes to it aren't ready yet, how is that hypocritical? It's not like we were like \"Yo dawg, let's add a bunch more flat pen items!\" Okay, yes I realize we put Brutalizer into the AD Jungle Enchantment, but that's still only coming in for a single champion (if that) each game.\n\nIt kind of stopped being about calling you guys out on hypocrisy and became more of just a rant. I played some of my first games with these season changes and hated pretty much everything about it, so I wrote this up and went to bed. I'm really annoyed that you guys would implement so many changes (most of them unnecessary) and then completely neglect fixing one of the most broken aspects of the game. If I have almost 300 armor I shouldn't be dying to physical damage from 1 champion in 3-4 seconds. Being pigeonholed into building 1 of 3 viable defensive items (banshee's, randuin's, Guardian Angel) as a damage-dealer sucks. How is it fair that I need to build 2-4 defensive items to survive the damage created by them building 1 item?\n\n> Enforcing the Meta ->\n> \n> Really nothing we've done enforces a requirement in how you play the game. We've seen people bring Smite and still head top lane because they want the Smite benefits and items. I wouldn't be surprised if a 5-Smite all lane team were totally viable, since the jungle respawns so slowly now. It's actually probably increased the ability for teams to run no jungler. Yes, the value of Dragon/Baron make bringing Smite into the game really valuable, but the way you do it is still up to the players and teams. And if we've so severely pushed champions into \"only being able to support others\" why is solo lane Lulu/Karma/Zilean/etc. still a thing? Some champions are TRUE protectors (Sona, Soraka for example) and so they naturally don't fit well in solo lanes, but that's no different from saying, \"Well, Annie's a bad Marksman, way to enforce the meta, Riot.\" Champions are good at different things. This is a GOOD thing. Otherwise, picking a champion is literally irrelevant.\n\nYou build champions from the ground up to be used in a 2-person botlane (ADC/support), fighting other 2-person (ADC/Support) botlanes. There's a very distinct reason that you don't see people often breaking that formula in competitive play: because it's the most reliable way of winning the game. And riot intends for this lane to exist in all competitive play. Any time anything causes this lane to be even semi-unviable, you guys quickly go to great lengths to bring it back. \n\nI can play a metabreaker botlane successfully all the way into high gold/platinum, but that doesn't imply viability. Low elo metabreaking doesn't matter.\n\n> Counterplay ->\n> \n> First, item-based counterplay is not very interesting. One of the designers posted about Tenacity and Knockups a few days ago, if you want to look around for that.\n\nI agree that it's not interesting, but I'd argue that item-based counterplay is integral to the health of the game. Giving people the option of building defensive items to counter assassins, for example, is a lot better than removing or severely reducing the ability for assassins to assassinate. If you give everyone the ability to 'outplay' an assassin, then an assassin can no longer reliably do their job in any capacity and becomes a burden to their team when compared to reliable champion picks.\n\n> Second, the thing is we've actually been INCREASING ability counterplay of the course of the game. On launch, what percentage of champions had point and click stuns? Literally, just put your cursor over someone, receive stun, no extra cost to you. Off the top of my head, I can think of Taric, Annie, Sion. You could make a case for Ryze... I can't think of any more right now. Almost 10% of the champion lineup had a literally zero-counterplay hard crowd control. Since then we've removed Sion's and added a whole bunch of other champions, lowering that percentage pretty severely. What, 2% now? Any champion that DID get targeted CC had some kind of drawback: Nocturne has to hold the tether. Malzahar has to safely channel. Vi is now inside the team and better be tanky enough to survive. Otherwise, every hard CC we add to the game can be dodged or has some kind of extra counter-playable requirement in order to receive the CC.\n\nAnd I'm glad. I think over the time I've played this game you guys have made leaps and bounds of improvement. Giving CC conditional requirements is one of the largest improvements we've seen.\n\nHOWEVER: If we continue down this road of knockup spam, we're going to be looking at teamfights of one person getting caught out and then eating layers and layers of unmitigated knockups. I know this is a bit of a slippery-slope argument, but I'm very much worried of this becoming a reality because I've already started seeing occasional games of this happening.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Yoella","date":"2014-12-04T10:44:46.780+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello Rioter!

And it's not too difficult to realize that you are suddenly doing less damage after the enemy smites you. \n\nAlso, being a couple dragons behind has always made you behind, and I actually feel that the new dragon is easier to catch up to. The old one gave gold which automatically gave stats, the new dragon only gives stats the first, fourth, and fifth kills. This means that if team A gets the first dragon, they are now (unless they get the first dragon late in the game) only a little behind because they won't have all that much ad/ap so they won't gain a lot either. Now, if team B waits too long to get the second dragon, team A will now be more ahead, but by the time the next dragon spawns, if team A and team B duke it out, team B will still have a fair chance at winning (if maybe a small disadvantage), and if they do win, team B will now be fully caught up with team A dragon wise. Now, if team A wins, team A would not really have an increase in stats, just pushing potential, and the next dragon, team B will still only be a little (more than before though) behind team A and has another chance. \n\nIf adcs are so good, then why isn't a full team of them a thing? There's currently a balance, and it really hasn't been disrupted at all by preseason (I'm still seeing one of each role in every game).

And it's preseason, Riot already has changes on the PBE to try and make more jungler viable.\n\nEdit: By knock ups, I mean knock ups released this preseason, seeing that is what this thread is about.\n\nAlso, Kalista does counter a specific branch of champions with pretty much no counterplay, but in a way, that has always been here. I know Riot is being partially hypocritical like OP said, but there is only so much counterplay you can give depending on the role of the champion. I agree Kali is a bit too much (some nerfs to her passive and buffs to the rest of her might help), but assassins have always been known for being able to kill the adc or apc with little counterplay, it is just now melees are feeling it as well. But if you look at the overall picture, Kali, even though she hard counters melees, does not have anything else really special about her. \n\nI agree that Kalista does counter some melees a little too much, but adcs have always been good at that, Kali is just extremely good at it.","replies":[{"poster":"PrinceArchie","date":"2014-12-02T08:39:35.879+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":4,"body":"Debatable.

Try having a team with no marksman, though...\n\n> In the current game Dragon is actually superior to Baron in every way.\n\nNot in every way - Baron is still better for siegeing towers. Dragon doesn't help with that until the 4th stack, which is rarely achieved. If you want to close out the game, it's still Baron over Dragon.\n\n> Two of the jungle buffs are completely pointless\n\nOnly Wolves are bad. Gromp and Krugs are both good starting points and the Raptor buff is considered the best.\n\n> Most of the junglers have been gated out of the jungle\n\nThis is a common complaint every year.\n\n> only two of the jungle items are even worth getting and are ridiculously strong.\n\nBoth are getting nerfed in 4.21 - Trailblazer won't reduce the cooldown of Smite anymore and Skirmisher's Sabre no longer works on every hit (it's a DoT instead). Devourer is netting nerfed as well, down to 25 damage.","replies":[]}]}]}
