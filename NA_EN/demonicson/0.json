(Instead of the icon you're giving for first mission)\n\nIf it doesn't... Then I think it should. \nI just unlocked the Icon and the Border by crafting it, and wouldn't want to switch to anything else at the moment.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-06-17T20:32:59.472+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It does!  Per the [event page FAQ](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/featured/events/vs-2017), any icon pertaining to Chaos should work for you.  :D  Let me know if that clears things up!","replies":[{"poster":"Demonicson","date":"2017-06-18T01:05:21.337+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Very nice, I did read a bit of the FAQ, but I guess I wasn't thorough- \nThank you for clarification.","replies":[]}]}]}
