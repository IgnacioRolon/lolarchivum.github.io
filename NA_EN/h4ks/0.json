If you build him straight armor tank against an ad team, nobody can kill you and you can duel some champions. Bopping people is so much fun, and being able to stun, lower their armor, ult, heal yourself. He's such a fun champion with a lot of good things in his kit. I personally love his ult. As a support, its a great skill. Plus, he's got some great skills to go along with him.
