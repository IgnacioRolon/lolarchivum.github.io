While I continue to expand and grow my pool there are numerous ones that I can overlap but now I've noticed that I cannot seem to fit everything that I want to do for each possible setup and hate to have to cut possibilities for specific champions/groups.  I have some pages dedicated to specific champions only and some that are wide but I've been wanting to test around with a few other various pages but have ran out of room and would like to have more than 20 pages!\r\n\r\nTL;DR: Is there a possibility in the future or near future to have more than 20 rune and mastery pages?\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nA Season 1 Vet.","replies":[{"poster":"watbesh","date":"2014-12-26T14:13:38.128+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've seen this sort of request several times and I totally agree. If I'm not too late, I have some ideas and feelings about expanding Runes & Masteries.\n\n* Rune/Masteries page limit is probably due to their data storage (I'm certain they're stored in the server). In order to expand their limits, we must overcome this problem.\n* If they allow us to have more Rune Pages, this also means some more IP sink, which is good for some players.\n* Allowing to store them locally (like Item Sets) would be great too; you can get unlimited pages! The downsides are, that the game would have to verify them before loading, and that it won't benefit those playing without their main computer.\n* It shouldn't really matter with 25 pages, but if they get too many, you might want to arrange those pages with filters and/or folders.","replies":[{"poster":"HexTechBomber","date":"2014-12-27T07:13:52.325+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like your idea, you seemed to put thought into it :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MissValkyrie","date":"2014-12-26T18:25:30.159+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"If you can't fit everything you need into 20 pages you are organized poorly.","replies":[{"poster":"HexTechBomber","date":"2014-12-27T07:13:29.382+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Or I have a wide variety of champions from various pools and I have various setups for different scenario's that I'd use and there are more than what I have available especially for Rune pages.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DSRM Mobius","date":"2014-12-26T17:05:44.589+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeh","replies":[]},{"poster":"jimmylism","date":"2014-12-26T17:01:39.234+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think we should just have rune page setup in champion select like the masteries.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DrCyanide","date":"2014-12-26T14:56:21.790+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"*Looks at his 6 rune pages*\n\nThis is going to take a while...","replies":[]}]}
