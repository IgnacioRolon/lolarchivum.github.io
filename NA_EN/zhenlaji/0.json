Anyways, after seeing the change they are about to make to {{champion:11}} and {{item:1419}} , I just felt like he is going to become top 5 banned champion, again. That, I don&#039;t want to see because I play him in ranked and usually does quite well with him, at least until patch 6.9.\n\nThe thing that happened in patch 6.9 is that Master Yi can&#039;t really build tank anymore because the damage is lacking. But if he goes full AD, he would be decimated easily unless he does the clean up. So, he can only be a janitor. While that is not bad, it is also not good.\n\nPatch 6.10 is like a savior to Master Yi. If you haven&#039;t checked, Patch 6.10 in PBE buffs {{champion:11}}&#039;s Wuju style&#039;s actives bonus true damage from 12/19/26/33/40 to 14/23/32/41/50. Now people might say: &quot;it is 10 more damage per hit, give it a break&quot;. Yes, 10 true damage per hit on an assassin build is not that much. But this 10 damage revives the tank Master Yi build. Also, {{item:1419}} gets 10% extra attack speed and has a 4% max hp shred instead of 3%. Now this is not just revival, this is Jesus picking you up, washing you off with holy water, and blessing you with holy power. \n\nA possible 6.10 tank build can be: {{item:1419}} {{item:3124}} {{item:3742}} {{item:3102}} {{item:3026}} {{item:3111}}. The core is obviously {{item:1419}} {{item:3124}} . Here is why this build or builds of similar pattern will become &quot;over-powered&quot; again.\n\n* Pro: Rageblade alone provides Wuju Style enough damage to match the damage before patch 6.6 (The nerf on E).\n* Pro: Less farm, more ganks.\n* Pro: Bloodrazor deals 4% max hp as ad instead of 60 magic damage.\n* Con: Rage blade deals 20-30 less magic damage on hit, and cost 800 gold more.\n* Con: The double on hit effect triggers on 6th attack instead of 2nd.\n\nFrom the above, we can see that the only real set back is the time it takes for you to get to full power during a fight. However, with four items that gives you survivability, you are now capable go getting to that state. The 4% max hp out scales 60 magic damage by miles, however the remove of scaling damage on the Rageblade does hurt a little. The 800 gold cost seems a lot. However, you can now gank a lot more. This means, if you are good at ganking, you will be unstoppable. So basically, the tank Build&#039;s damage is back and better but it takes time to build up that damage during a fight. \n\nThe conclusion is, this update lifts Master Yi out of the dirt that RIOT left him on with the release of 6.9. However, it gives him too much potential, making him unplayable due to the high ban rate.\n\n_Extras: I wonder what is happening in RIOT&#039;s balance department. It is like, your father gives you a monthly allowance. But realize it is too much because now you are buying things you shouldn&#039;t be buying, like books and stuff. So he cuts your monthly allowance down to half. And then cuts some more because you are still buying books! One day he is like, &quot;you know what? No more allowance for you&quot;. After one month, he saw that you lost 20 pounds because you didn&#039;t even have money to buy food. So he starts giving you monthly allowance again, with doubled the amount!
