The new jungle doesn't do this champion any justice when he has no jump and no way of actually getting to an enemy champion. {{champion:72}}  ult is poor at best allowing you to pick off a single person in auto attack range. If anyone on enemy team brings a single slow tho then {{champion:72}}  can be kited more easily than {{champion:77}}  with less threat.\r\nSeriously rito you just need to fix this outdated and poor champion.","replies":[{"poster":"Venowolf","date":"2015-01-26T20:13:51.493+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"He need new mechanics his kit It's boring actually and his E feels very useless with and very easy dodgeable skillshot and non damage\n\nNow my thougths:\n\nW:\n\nSHIELD: 80 / 135 / 190 / 245 / 300 (+ 80% AP) to 60/70/80/90/100 (+ 8/9/10/11/12% of  Skarner's TOTAL Health)** and 15% of tenacity during the shield.**\n\nBase shield value lowered to 60/70/80/90/100 from 80/135/190/245/300\n\nShield now scales on 8/9/10/11/12% of Skarner's TOTAL Health from 80% of his AP.\n\nSkarner now is more oriented to the tank side (after the 2nd rework), and are a very few items that he builds with ap (ICB, Trinity and maybe Abyssal Scepter). So that 80% AP is very useless. I mean he need some reward to build tanky like Sejuani or Nautilus and that \"TOTAL Health\" is the thing that Skarner need in his kit. A huge shield that make him feel like a fast-truck. You are the responsable on the Skarner rework so please change his \"magic\" Shield into a very powerful \"solid\" shield. IMO has more sense the TOTAL Health scaling instead the AP...\n\n\nE.

I'll prefer  make a completly new E like the previously showed, It's very fustrating see that ridiculous damage, is like \"nothing\"..","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cale017","date":"2014-12-01T00:21:52.050+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I only started playing him a few weeks ago, but he's pretty quickly become one of my favorite champs to jungle with. He was still clearing well enough when I took him for a spin a few days ago in the new jungle, and he can't really be kited well if you use his abilities right. W for the MS boost, land your E for the slow, and if you've built a Phage or a Triforce, the passive boost to your MS on auto attacks ensures no one can get away.\n\nBut really, saying his ult is poor? He has one of the best ults in the game IMO. There's nothing sweeter than flash ulting out of a bush to stop an enemy from getting a kill on a teammate, or locking down an ADC in the middle of a fight for a few seconds so they can't do anything while their pals die around them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"EffectFX","date":"2014-12-01T02:17:09.182+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Actually after they changed skarner's passive he became a lot better.

His current passive is good for what it is.\n\nHere's a much better one that isn't OP:\nAfter using an ability, Skarner's next basic attack slows the target by 2 / 4 / 6% per stack of Crystal Venom (8 / 16 / 24% slow at four/full stacks) for 1.5 seconds (upgrades at levels 9 and 16). This cannot stack with itself, consecutive empowered basic attacks will only refresh the slow. If this is added, then Skarner's perma-slow returns in exchange for his only non-ultimate, Hard CC. The slow is different from his old perma-slow in that it isn't AoE, and it takes a while to ramp up. It grants better peel in teamfights and will changes his ganks up a great deal.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
