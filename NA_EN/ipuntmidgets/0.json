Now i know that they enjoy the thought of this rotating game mode and if you are going to use that to test new ideas, then it&#039;s great. The problem is that a huge percentage of the league of legends community loved this specific game type as much or more than they love aram. \r\nSo if you guys could give me your opinions on this and if we could get a rito employee to inform us on if this could be possible then lets do it","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-03-24T22:45:13.576+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"It needs massive work before it would be viable for permanent addition.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ahama1","date":"2018-03-24T22:14:21.816+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if it is it will no longer be urf","replies":[]},{"poster":"Balderdash","date":"2018-03-24T22:12:21.589+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ranked ARURF","date":"2018-03-26T19:18:46.598+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"people commenting negatively because they didnt like snowdown arurf. its normal, that was a fail. what we want, is URF, with the heal nerf and traps (shaco teemo) nerf. Just URF. people are trying to discredit by saying it makes people leave the game but its false. we leave because urf is better than LOL and why would we lose time of our life playing our number 2 game. well find another number 1. for years now ive been msging riot, signing petitions and checking the forum to have it. i said numerous times that im willing to pay. monthly fees if its needed. idc, its just the best game ever. lol is too slow for me. i wont lose my life time like that.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sp33d Zer0","date":"2018-03-24T23:54:56.018+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"No","replies":[]},{"poster":"MrHaZeYo","date":"2018-03-24T23:04:39.233+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"The reason Urf is enjoyable is because we don't have it all the time.\n\nIt gets old fast.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SmashinBob","date":"2018-03-24T22:50:53.951+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Urf is nice, but i feel my hands fall off after a few days of urf. But to be honest they really need to make rotating modes much more often, my favorite is one for all, but i have no idea how many years ago i last played it, maybe it was on at some point, but i missed it I guess.
