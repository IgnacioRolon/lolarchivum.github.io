At level 30 you should know to cs. it was 18 mins in the game at the moment we lost and he only had 15 cs. 15 cs in 18 mins. That's not even 1 cs a minute.","replies":[{"poster":"Nik Nikerson","date":"2017-08-06T04:03:44.244+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You _should_ know to farm, but not everyone does.

Actual gameplay footage would help as that would determine if he was trolling or not. But right off the bat nothing seems out of the ordinary. His build seems normal, and his only \"troll\" like behavior is dying too many times. But with a champion like Ryze that has a large learning curve its not to hard to believe he just playing badly. He is probably new to the game/champion, or saw someone he likes (streamer, or proplayer) playing with this champion and decided to try him out.","replies":[{"poster":"Tìmë","date":"2017-08-06T01:21:02.171+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He was just auto attacking top no skills or csing were done.","replies":[{"poster":"Tìmë","date":"2017-08-06T01:21:41.660+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can't believe he was just new to the game excuse cause he reached level 30.

Look at it ! He has JUST ONE LEVEL mastery on a Ryze ! We all know that the new Ryze requires some skills. This guy should get more knowledge of the game and OF COURSE practice Ryze in normals if he really likes the champion. But trying it in ranked games should be punishable. (That's my opinion)","replies":[]},{"poster":"EarthyMadness","date":"2017-08-05T06:47:24.932+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Ryze is a champion that has a steep learning curve, and you're punished heavily for the slightest slipup. More importantly, higher latency (200+ms) connections basically turn Ryze into an instakill for any bursty enemy, while low (~20ms) latency connections allow Ryze to delete you, if you're good at him.\n\nSome people struggle with Ryze, I did when I first joined and it made me nervous to try him, still haven't to this day.\n\nI think it's important to look at his rank vs the rank the match was in. If he's a newer player to ranked, some of those could be in Qualifiers, which often place you in a higher ranked environment (I got put into S1/G5 Elo for my first 2 matches, then S3-4 for my next 3)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lapis","date":"2017-08-05T06:27:19.565+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"These scores look like mine sometimes.
