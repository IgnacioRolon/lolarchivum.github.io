I just want to understand if I was in the wrong? \r\n\r\n            I was in a game with a support. We went in and in the end got first blood. I died in the progress and my support kept attacking their ADC with auto- attacks. I went back to rewatch this part of the story to get my facts straight. I pinged him to back 5 times in total and then he ignores each ping and goes in on them. He dies and I type &quot;...&quot; to which he replies &quot; stop pinging me it&#039;s distracting&quot; and I said, &quot;then back.&quot; \r\n           This is when all hell breaks loose and he runs down mid and kills himself claiming he was gonna take mid turret down one hit at a time. I tell the enemy team to report, and they laugh at me. Fine with that because I know my team understands me. Little did I know, they would soon turn against me as well claiming I started this whole thing and that it was my fault for being toxic. Pretty sure everyone then reported me after the game and this support came out looking like Batman; fighting against the ever growing injustice of toxicity.","replies":[{"poster":"AlQaeda Taliban","date":"2017-09-03T11:38:32.706+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I play support as well, and when the adc pings me more than 3 times for no reason i reply with one ping on his face.

As far as playing the fight i cant say as i didn't see the fight itself, but looks like you're both wrong.\n\nAs far as toxic behavior. i'd say you prob started it...Yea the support made a mistake, everyone makes them and after the support said don't ping him it's obvious he's salty and anything further would turn into an argument or in this case trolling.\n\n\nLet him be, no need to keep it going.\n\n\nDon't get me wrong, he's also in the wrong for running it down too and arguing with you just as much.\n\n\nConclusion: you're both at fault... should make that a 3rd option","replies":[{"poster":"Not xPeke","date":"2017-09-03T11:35:02.937+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"The Support said something to him. To which he replied.\n\nPeople need to understand that you don't always get to have the last word. Expecting it only shows how immature and self entitled you are.\nThis also shows an underlining issue with the mentality of players.\n\nJust because you're arguing doesn't mean you're toxic.\nTalking back to someone without crossing a line (like insults or rage) should never be deemed as toxic or be at fault (like in this case), even if it starts an argument. You can't control other people's emotion and you shouldn't have THEM control what you can do and say. If they overreact and take it the wrong way, then it's their problem, not yours.\n\nIt's actually a very acceptable idea for someone to reply \"then back\" when being told to stop pinging. It can actually be seen as advice if it were to happen again. But people like to play the victims, oh well.\nSorry, I don't agree with you saying it's both their fault. The Support is just a kid and should be banned. \nFunnily enough I bet he probably gets other players banned by making them rage at him for trolling/inting and provoking them like in this case.","replies":[{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2017-09-03T13:07:43.396+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"actually he(adc) said something first as in \"...\" which in retrospect translate to \"really?\"\n\ni understand you want to defend him, they're both children because they started arguing back and forth for a little before the support decided to int.\n\nI don't care if you don't agree but when it comes to it, they both are in the wrong.","replies":[{"poster":"Not xPeke","date":"2017-09-03T14:18:02.572+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"oh dear, he said \"...\", SO BAD, HOW COULD HE?\n\nThis isn't unicorn land though, with fairies and rainbows, people have to realise this. You just can't afford to be so soft skinned.\n\nHe made a salty comment, whatever, it could have easily been ignored and left it at that. But the victim-playing Support had to find an excuse to INT and troll.\n\nHis comment might spark the argument but he's not the one actually arguing. The Support player did everything himself and took it too far, escalating the argument.\nEDIT: So if someone provokes you into doing something, do you then blame him for provoking you and making you do it?","replies":[{"poster":"Splatyo","date":"2017-09-04T07:51:26.716+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lmao. league of legends is at fault, that person has probably had so many toxic adc's that have done that type of stuff before, on top of the fact that you have to play a 40 minute game that you may or may not lose, and then there's the stress of losing lp and having to waste even mooore time just to get back to where you were.\n\nthis support was obviously tilted and at fault, but can you really blame the support raised in this league community! xD and yeah I would take constant pinging as tilting/trying to provoke me\n\nbut thats the game.. people spam ping when trying to annoy others. never point out another person's mistakes, trust they won't take your advice, and even if after game they decide to take your advice....... you'll never see them again. the support inting is... well more acceptable than him flaming you why? because riot won't punish it lmao. unless they went 0/13","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Tìmë","date":"2017-09-03T06:09:13.808+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it wasn't really an argument.

Regardless of whether you or him made a mistake, even if you said something bad or insulting to him which I assume you did not, inting the game is as bad as toxicity gets and is never excuseable. The only mistake I can see is you asking the enemy team for reports, they often don't care and will see this as whining/verbal and just report you instead, not like you have to worry about it if you didn't do anything offensive but it can still make people on both teams distracted and angry","replies":[]}]}
