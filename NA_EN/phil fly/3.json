Like the opposite of the Midas touch. Something worse.\n\nLet's start with the basics. Google \"CertainlyT\". You'll come up with a boatload of popular threads that have been spawning over *years* stating how CertainlyT should not even be *allowed* to design any more champions.\n\n*\"They're fun to play and make flashy plays!\"* you say. You can give a champion glitter bombs for abilities, I don't care, but the second you give a champion\n\n **double crit chance, a shield for around 25% of his max hp at lvl 18,\na critically-striking tornado, an ability that can nullify most ultimates in the game,\ninfinite dashes, an AoE suspension on almost no cooldown, and 50% bonus armor penetration**\n#ALL WHILE HAVING NO MANA COSTS\nYou gotta problem. If you go around throwing out champions like this anymore, this game's gonna be nothing but people blinking all over the map with 1,000 movespeed. And you know what? This isn't the only problematic champion you've made. I could go on for days about Darius, Thresh, Kalista. But what I'm most afraid about is Mordekaiser.\n\nAs stated by [This thread right here](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/AFgsaz6L-certainlyts-reasoning-behind-forcing-morde-into-bot), CertainlyT wants Morde bot because he can't be healthy in a solo lane. Instead of try to fix this, They gut his W so it's only useful in a duo-lane. This Idiot working at Riot goes head-first into the rework without any remorse for the players. I myself loved Mordekaiser. Never played him support, don't know how it goes, but what I **do** know is that the last thing Morde wants is to be some adc's bitch.\n\nIn addition, there have been numerous complaints about CertainlyT in the past. This issue isn't a new one, really. Like I said before, google \"CertainlyT\".\n\n[Stating that He shouldn't be allowed to make champions](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/yqioklAk-certainlyt-should-not-be-allowed-to-make-another-champion)\n[Stating he is the worst game designer at Riot](http://www.gamefaqs.com/boards/954437-league-of-legends/68934978)\n[Stating that (in another comment) he is working for the wrong damn game](http://www.gamefaqs.com/boards/954437-league-of-legends/68934978?page=0)\n\nWell, that's the end of my rant. Take it or leave it, upvote it or downvote it, report me or not, I don't care. It's my opinion and I want to get it out there.\n\n#Just please to GOD, NEVER TOUCH ANY CHAMPIONS AGAIN","replies":[{"poster":"A Miss Fortune","date":"2015-08-05T03:18:23.348+0000","up_votes":61,"down_votes":3,"body":"{{champion:157}} overloaded, he has how many passives again?

What team fight lasts for 15 seconds?  They give Yasuo all these tools, but does he need to actually use them in order to one shot a squishy?  Nah!  Just spam your R button down right behind your Gragas jungler and let the game take over from there!

That wall is debatably more versatile and stronger than Braum's, who was designed around the fact that his wall was so strong.\n\nKalista...Outside of her passive I think it is a creative and relatively well thought out kit. It has some problems sure but most champs need some fine tuning after release.

For example, Darius is easy to kite as hell, Yasuo is easy to counter, easy to shutdown & make him useless, kalista is support dependant, without a good coordination, she isn't match of other adc. Well and zyra, i don't know, she's not a unic CertainlyT design, the only problem isn't the kit, but the ratio she have. Of course, it doesn't made them funny to play against, but this is a normal point, when you play, you don't have to be happy to play against this or this champion, you have to be happy to play the champion you took, in a given situation\n\nSince i'm playing yasuo, & you talk about him:\n\n- Double crit chance is the main power source of yasuo, without this, he is literally nothing. Too squishy for long fight, not enough strong for win against an other fighter, nor an adc with a normal positionning\n- Actually, the shield isn't 25% of his health, it depends on his level, not the hp. You are against a shield which have a time of 1s, useful only against poke mage and ranged champion, which he is designed to be a good counter. \n- As often, the famous \"infinite dash\" of yasuo, truly funny. He have an high mobility only with minions around him, the dash cannot be perform for 10-6s on the same target. What an instant dash & infinite, indeed. \n- About the windwall, like i said, he's supposed to be a fighter, a hypercarry able to kill adc, & mage with ranged attack, the cooldown is always high, it's easy to force him on use it. After a yasuo used the windwall, he'll be easy to attack during a good time. But hey, it's too hard to use the brain in a teamfight?\n- Now let's talk about the ultimate. The ultimate is the main & current problem in yasuo: in the hand of a good team compo, it's gamebreaker. But, usually, yasuo die just after performed this ulti, due to his squishy fish state\nI think a up to the cooldown is needed (40/50s as Talon ulti maybe). For the 50% of penetration on BONUS Armor, maybe the time should be reduced to 7-10s, enough for be able to deal damage to tanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Audiomancy","date":"2015-08-06T00:38:10.855+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MilamberZeo,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=FO1OnO7R,comment-id=0014,timestamp=2015-08-06T00:30:45.988+0000) Actually, the shield isn't 25% of his health, it depends on his level, not the hp.
