I&#039;m pretty sure I speak for all of the other collectors aswell when I say that having chromas in our &#039;Your Shop&#039; would be a major improvement and a nice touch for those of us who own all skins and would otherwise get kinda punished for spending a lot of money on this game.\r\n\r\nEven though this time around I missed out on a good deal because there was no alternative planned for those who own all skins, I hope that there will be something for us the next time around.","replies":[]}
