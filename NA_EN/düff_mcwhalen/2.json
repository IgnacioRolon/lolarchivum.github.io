I find people are more confident to commit when they see enemy HP bars dropping before they even start hitting them, vs my Leona games where I could land every stun and don't do damage, the enemy ignores me, and my team doesn't follow up.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"D端ff McWhalen","date":"2018-12-21T22:41:06.718+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What's the consensus on Syndra Support?

My skill shot game has improved too. You have to be sparing with your mana and make sure you hit all the abilities you can.","replies":[]}]}]}
