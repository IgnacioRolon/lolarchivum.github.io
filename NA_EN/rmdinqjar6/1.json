Other Korean teams will find ways to catch the GE tigers, Chinese teams will figure out the Korean integration, and several teams from other regions have showed glimmers of hope as well. SK gaming at their best could compete, although I don't know where their best went last week. TSM has had a few games this year where they look unstoppable by ANYONE but then then other games they look really out of sync. It all comes down to Dyrus with them, if he can deal with the early pressure and maintain his farm and composure, the rest of the team can count on him for team fights. Other times he succumbs to the early dives he is almost always a victim of, becomes irrelevant, and has no impact on the fights. For a team known for their strong teamfights, missing a large component that they usually can count on really throws them off. TPA and Flash Wolves look really impressive as well, although I haven't watched a whole lot from that region.\n\nI guess what I am trying to say is, and maybe I am just hopeful, we will see the most level playing field we have seen to date at this year's worlds!","replies":[]}]}
