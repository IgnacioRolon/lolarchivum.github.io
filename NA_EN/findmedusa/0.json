I have constant 55 ping which is standard and 120 frames as i have it capped and both rarely fluctuate, but constantly through the game it feels like im lagging. Was playing yesterday fine but today after patching feels trash.","replies":[{"poster":"Dark Morgana","date":"2017-08-11T01:03:49.702+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Let's go ahead and test your clients connection to the Server first.
