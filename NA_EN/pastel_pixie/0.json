Everything takes forever to load. At first I thought it was my laptop (refurbished). So I got a new laptop (refurbished, clean of everything). Downloaded and installed league on it, and after the installation, it went into the &quot;updating Client&quot;  screen. Instead of the photos and videos showing up, I got this message: &quot;we aren&#039;t able to load the page (something about checking my Internet)&quot; \r\nAfter I click on LITERALLY anything, it takes roughly 15 seconds for the client to actually &quot;click&quot; on it. \r\nI don&#039;t think it&#039;s my new laptop, this wasn&#039;t a problem with the old Client. Now I&#039;m down roughly $300 CAD. And nothing seems to be working. \r\n\r\nFYI the laptop runs everything else very smoothly, everything responds. If there was a way to still go back to the old Client. Even to test if it is in fact my laptop, or not. I&#039;d love to do it. I haven&#039;t played for weeks due to this","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-05-01T02:07:49.855+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have news for you: If a computer cost 300 CAD, it probably has a dualcore hamster with 6watt tpd for a processor. It is going to lag like hell doing _anything_.\n\nHave you tried enabling the low-spec mode in LoL client, cleaned up 3rd-party background processes, nuked the windows superfetch service, cortana, xbox shite, gamebar, and all the other tweaks to greatly speed up crappy laptops?","replies":[]}]}
