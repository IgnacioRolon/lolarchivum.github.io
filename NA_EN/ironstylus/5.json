So yeah, I think at some point we'll need a VU that takes his thematics and solidifies them. However, I'm not sure where that would be right now. A VU or thematic cohesion pass on Pantheon might need some more deep diving on Targon itself. Should he fit into the Leona/Diana storyline? I think so. I think it's an interesting opportunity to make him a pivotal character, not just some warrior dude with nothing terribly exceptional about him. However, I'm not sure what he represents in that story space of Targon nor what would really set him apart that would immediately say \"oh snap, this guy is different and interesting.\"\n\nStory aside, I think it might be interesting to do some foundation building on what the Rakkor are, and what they look like. We might need to do some groundwork to flesh out the society of the mountain, or what's on the mountain, to then extrapolate Pantheon's appearance from. There's a lot of different ways to approach him, right now I'm not sure which direction is a good one. Certainly open to suggestions.\n\nI know that eventually he'll get a pass, my hope is that we can build further on the Moon/Sun story thing and give him a unique space visually and thematically,","replies":[{"poster":"Samuel L Jaxx","date":"2014-07-14T05:26:50.802+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think some classical thematics should still be there, spartan inspired but not necessarily ripped right out from it.\n\nI mean Kratos is obviously inspired by myth, but he looks a thing all on his own too.\n\n\n\"Come and get some!\"\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molon_labe","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"CaptainMårvelous","date":"2014-07-10T06:30:47.553+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Let me ask about a champion who VERY MUCH needs a VU but seems to be rarely spoken of:\n\n{{champion:36}} \n\nHis run is more of a waddle, his animations are non-existant (Like he doesn't even really do anything.

I'm not 100% up on the skinny, as you said I don't work on the team really, but I think there's a general desire to make sure things are super cohesive when a new champion comes out. I think that can take additional bake time. Aside from that I'm not privy to the nitty gritty of production, but I think one of the reasons Relaunch has become a bit more consistent is to help out the churning of new content. In some cases are team is pretty much making a new champion. My feeling is that things will always sort of be a hybrid of champions, skins and now relaunches as being integral parts of content packages. \n\nI understand though. Champions are the biggest hype potential in terms of content, and can really have amazing promotional content, community discussion, and general excitement surround their build up and release. The champion release is still our biggest bang I feel. It feels like something huge is being added to the game, which it is. \n\nFor me personally, I miss some of the old days of slightly faster cadence, but I trust that the guys over on the Champion Team know what's up and are fully aware of what they're goals and deliverables are, and how fast those things should be put out.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Silverclaw","date":"2014-07-11T03:41:16.261+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oops, didn't know this thread existed.

He does feel really unique and sorta-fleshed out, just....old-looking. I'd like to see him go even more mad, maybe try and search for a cure for Warwick, or maybe Viktor can help fix up his body with some upgrades so he looks more cohesive with a probable Urgot VU.
