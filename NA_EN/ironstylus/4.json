With no numbers!","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":123,"down_votes":14,"body":"So, I'm not a designer, obviously. But! I've seen a lot of Diana threads pop up, and indeed she is on our list of low-hanging fruit on the potential gameplay update of the ChampUP team but she's not a priority at the moment. I'm actually jamming with Vesh and one of our new dudes, Paul, just ideating on stuff for a potential update. She's obviously close to my heart, so any discussion surrounding her peaks my interest. Many times, discussions say fighter Diana, some say Assassin Diana, but a lot of what I see on the forums focus around numbers. Thing is, a lot of our design internally focuses on creating holistic characters and cohesive themes, not just a walking spread sheet of base stats augmented by QWER mashing. \n\nSO! Community, I present a challenge. Make Diana a kit, **but don't use numbers. **\n\nWhether you take from her current kit, give her an entirely new kit, or change the order/effect of her existing kit, dandy. Just don't get into the nitty gritty. In this scenario, granularity is the enemy. Take a look at theme. How does the moon create an opportunity for this character's play style? Does moonlight application open up different abilities? Does she make the entire map dark aside from a single AOE damage zone? Does she have an entirely resource system different than mana? Is she a symbol of grace and uses her blade as sword play? Think about it. Think about synergy and the completeness of the experience. Think about Diana as a person, as a character through which you can feel is expressing her personality, motivation and core characteristics through her mechanics, not just an icon that's a series of numbers. \n\nI'm interested to see the suggestions :)","replies":[{"poster":"Kao Atlantis","date":"2014-08-06T01:10:22.260+0000","up_votes":92,"down_votes":12,"body":"{{champion:131}}\n\nI changed my mind on not changing her...\nI have put some thought into ideas on how to fix Diana now, without changing her unique identifying skills and characteristics.\n\n#**Summary:**\n> * All skills now have a bonus of some sort if the target is affected by her *Moonlight*.

I kept coming up with little ways to improve them though, so instead of continuing to reply to your post over and over, I made this post with variations of your ideas that I think improves upon them a little:\n\n# Passive:\n\n> Diana gains increased attack speed. Every 3rd auto attack cleaves nearby enemies. \n\n> Diana's first auto attack on any target afflicted by Moonlight will immediately cleave nearby enemies as well.\n\n# Q - Crescent Strike\n\n> (Unchanged) Diana unleashes a bolt of lunar energy that travels in an arc. Enemies struck take magic damage and are afflicted with Moonlight, granting sight for a time.\n\n# W - Pale Cascade\n\n> Diana gains a shield and creates three spheres that orbit her for a time. The spheres detonate on contact with an enemy unit, dealing magic damage to all nearby enemies and slowing them a small amount. This amount stacks for each sphere that hits the same unit.\n\n> When a sphere hits a target afflicted with moonlight, Diana gains a small amount of health and mana.\n\n# E - Lunar Rush\n\n> Diana dashes a short distance towards her mouse cursor, knocking any units she passes through aside, and does small AOE damage where she lands. \n\n>If Diana targets a unit afflicted with moonlight, Lunar Rush's becomes a targeted ability, it's range is increased, and its cooldown is reduced.\n\n#R - Moonfall\n\n> Diana raises her weapon into the air and summons a circle of moonlight at her mouse cursor's location. This circle afflicts all within it with Moonlight.\n\n> After one second, anyone still standing within the moonlight is pulled to the center and slowed.\n\n> If Diana is standing within the circle of moonlight, she absorbs the moonlight, causing her enemies to be pulled to her *immediately* and for her to gain increased attack speed.\n\nI like these ideas because they work better with both Assassin Diana and Bruiser Diana. Her ult in particular now makes sense with assassin Diana. Now that it marks people with Moonlight, it gives her a second way to jump in and assassinate someone.  \n\nHer W now helps with her lack of sustain as a bruiser, her mana problems, and her lack of sticking power now that Moonfall is no longer a frequently usable skill.\n\nI also *really* like the gameplay patterns and combo possibilities these skills and her ult opens up.  You could potentially do a lot of aoe damage to a lot of people in a short amount of time if you execute it perfectly.  Imagine using her ult to pull them together, jumping to them, slowing them with W, and procing her passive on each person individually, one by one (since the first auto attack against targets with Moonlight always trigger her passive). It gives her a lot of skill related high impact possibilities. It's the exact way a kit should be - a high level of skill, risk, and execution is rewarded with high impact results.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gixia","date":"2014-08-06T03:16:59.988+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":4,"body":"I actually really like the idea of Moonlight making the rest of her skills being more effective, and I should've mentioned that in similar idea I mentioned in another post.\n\nThat said, I don't agree with assassin Diana.  The Mt. Targon champs all have an 'all-in' theme going, where they go in and fight but can't really get back out.  This is something that doesn't work with an assassin.  Assassins are too fragile and need to be able to get back out, which would ruin the theme.  They tried giving Diana a bit more survivability to make up for this, but as has been demonstrated, doing this makes her too difficult to balance.  Either her survivability is oppressive or its irrelevant.  Making her a damage dealing fighter would still differentiate her from Leona who's a supportive tank, but would likely be more easily balanced while still maintaining the Mt. Targon theme of being all-in champs who don't back down from combat.\n\nBesides, Diana is not really the sneaky, opportunistic type that defines assassins.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Inspectre","date":"2014-08-06T13:58:32.782+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"I like the idea of giving all abilities interaction with moonlight instead of just R, but there are a few things here I don't agree with:\n\nSwitching R and E gives Diana an unfitting ultimate for an assassin because it feels like more of an initiation ability, rather than some sort of damage/mobility skill.  Also your ideas for Lunar Rush make it seem really strong as a basic ability (almost as strong as a Vi ultimate).  The last point I want to bring up is that if all of her abilities have a bonus effect with moonlight, why not do the same for her passive.  It would be cool if hitting a target afflicted by moonlight with Moonsilver Blade did something like reducing ability cooldowns, granted bonus attack speed, or maybe movement speed.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Continuüm","date":"2014-08-06T03:26:53.442+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"I love your kit ideas! I just have one change that I would like to suggest: If her E is dashing to a target afflicted by Moonlight, it makes Diana feel like an assassin with a teamfight capability via her ultimate (AoE Tidal Moon Pull). But to solidify the \"assassin\" aspect, what about having her E slightly isolate her target? It would mean E is a **skillshot** though. For example:\n\n**E: Lunar Rush**\n> Diana dashes in a direction towards the first enemy afflicted by *Moonlight*, and her Lunar Rush cool down is reduced by some amount if she connects with the target. Any enemies in the way are knocked aside and take damage. If Diana dashes in a direction where no targets are afflicted with *Moonlight*, she goes the full duration of her dash distance and dashes through enemies instead of knocking them aside.\n\nI personally feel like this would solidify her \"assassin\" mechanic, giving her a way in, a target, and a potential escape for a sticky situation. It also increases the benefits of hitting her arcing Q. It adds a gameplay mechanic, and if the Q can hit the enemy backline, Diana has a chance to get in and deal some real damage and disruption in a teamfight. It might be a bit too strong though. Thoughts?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Killer X 12","date":"2014-08-07T06:21:33.387+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"For the new ult/old E i was thinking that depending on the size of the ult the screen could also darken for those inside the area of effect. Say for example the radius remained the same, but a sort of smokescreen/Noc effect was applied to those in it (since it is an ult now). Or if the size was larger that it applied to those outside and those but those inside could not see what was outside of the AOE but everything within the AOE shined with moonlight for a second or two. Another idea i'd like to be passed around is that if someone was affected with moonlight when they were ulted by Diana they gained a different debuff called luminescence (which is just another word for moonlight), but this would last about as long as moonlight but if they died within this time Diana got a small movement speed increase to allow her to chase the rest of the people left. \n\nI'd also like to think about the function of the W. Applying more damage on targets with moonlight is really cool, but maybe have it apply the attack speed buff (instead of on her passive, not in addition to it) OR slow down the enemy (like the old E does) OR extends the amount of time that moonlight lasts on a target. For example say you Q someone and it applies moonlight. You E to them with your W up and one of ur spheres hits them. Your moonlight would normally last long enough to E once or twice. Say if all three spheres of the W hits one enemy then it refreshes or straight up applies moonlight. This allows for people to avoid giving the Diana another chance to E to them (through use of minions, a team mate or jungle creeps) but also allows a skilled Diana to refresh the moonlight debuff and E an additional time. This makes her very sticky in some cases, but allows for counter play in others, and also makes it so it is very hard to get that second application of moonlight to a person in a team fight. I'd also like to point out that the shield is already great for dueling people, but giving it this effect would add an extra bit of dynamic action to Diana play but also very reasonable counter play most of the time. \n\nALSO, Diana must remain AP. lol MUST!\n\nSo here are my edits to what you have:\n \n\n**Passive (same as above): **\n\n> Every 3rd attack cleaves nearby enemies. If the enemies are affected by Moonlight, Diana gains an attack speed boost (that scales with AP). \n\n\n**Q: Crescent Strike (same as above):**\n\n> Diana unleashes a bolt of lunar energy that travels in an arc. Enemies struck take magic damage and are afflicted with Moonlight, granting sight for a time.\n\n**W: Pale Cascade:**\n\n> Diana gains an absorption shield that creates three spheres that orbit her for a time. The spheres detonate on contact with an enemy unit, dealing damage to the enemy hit. If all three spheres hit an enemy then moonlight is applied. If all three spheres hit and the enemy is suffering from moonlight then refresh moonlight and the next auto procs her passive.\n\n** E: Lunar Rush**\n\n> Diana dashes towards the mouse cursor, if she dashes into an enemy that is affected by Moonlight, her Lunar Rush cool down is reduced by some amount. The range of Lunar Rush is increased if there is an enemy CHAMPION effected by moonlight (Think Nid's new \"hunted\" thing).\n> \n> Consider: doing damage to those the rush passes through like Leona E (even if it only applies to those who have moonlight on them already)\n\n**R: Moonfall**\n\n> Diana draws in all nearby enemies to her location, slowing them. All targets effected by moonlight take damage and are denied vision outside of the radius of Moonfall for a short time. \n\n\n\nTell me what ya think.

Secondarily, she's a silver mirror of Leona.\n\nHow do we translate this theme into mechanics while retaining elements of her current feel? Diana's most distinctive elements are the PBAOE vacuum of Moonfall and Crescent Strike's, uh, crescent shape. Both are mechanically cool, and thematically appropriate. But could she be MORE moon-themed? I sure hope so.\n\nDiana's current identity is split between fighter and assassin. One thought I've had (inspired by Gnar!) is to have her wax and wane, with a couple of them growing stronger and a couple growing weaker. Full Moon Diana is a fighter, New Moon Diana is an assassin. This could be really cool, but it's probably too much mindshare. Actually, this is a pretty cool premise, let's prototype it:\n\nResource: Diana is now resourceless, but her resource bar now indicates the phase of the moon, which shifts throughout the game on a set schedule. Her abilities are in a state of either Full or New, with different strengths depending on the mode. The moon doesn't completely abruptly switch visually, it does do so mechanically. When the moon is Full, she's more of a fighter; when it's New, she's an assassin.\n\n**Passive:** Similar to the current one. Passively grants attack speed in New Moon (like live) and resistances in Full Moon. \n\n**Q:** Similar to live, sends out a crescent sweep. \n*Full* — Lower damage, Moonlight slows. Sort of like Aatrox E.\n*New* — Higher damage (about equal to live — resourcesless, remember?), no slow. Longer lasting Moonlight.\n\n**W:** Still generates three orbiting orbs around her that detonate on contact, dealing damage (equal amount regardless of the phase). No initial shield. Somewhat harder to detonate all three than on Live, because the reward for doing so is better.\n*Full* — If all three pop, gets a large shield.\n*New* — If all three pop, Diana turns invisible for a brief duration.\n\n**E:** A dash to a target, similar to her ult on live.\n*Full* — No damage, cooldown resets when used to dash to Moonlit target.\n*New* — Low to moderate damage, cooldown resets on kill/assist, can be used to dash to a Moonlit champ anywhere. This does not break her stealth until she arrives at the target.\n\n**R:** Completely different abilities in Full and New, shared cooldown.\n*Full* — Akin to her current Moonfall, but with a stronger vacuum.\n*New* — Diana turns invisible for a moderate duration. Dealing damage or being damaged by champion autoattacks or single target abilities reveals her briefly. Attacks from stealth always trigger Moonsilver Blade.","replies":[{"poster":"Spinny J","date":"2014-08-06T15:05:29.180+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think having a \"phase of the moon\" theme is a really interesting and unique idea. I think having it be based on time allows for both states to be really strong in their own way, with their weaknesses actually mattering too. Similar to what Riot's trying with Gnar; by having the states be somewhat out of the player's control, you can balance them without having to account for the fact that players can just choose which state is most appropriate, removing the weaknesses of said state.\n\nA variation of this idea, which at first I thought you were going with, was that rather than two states of Full and New that Diana switches between, it would instead be a continuum. So New and Full would be similar to your idea, but they would gradually transition rather than abruptly. As Diana moves from New to Full, her bonus AS decreases and her bonus resistances increase, her Q starts to do less damage and starts to apply the slow (small slow at first that gradually increases to its maximum once she hits full moon), etc. This idea isn't really compatible with your current E and R though.","replies":[{"poster":"Thales","date":"2014-08-06T17:10:09.035+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the feedback!\n\nYeah, that variation was actually what it started out as, but the design evolved as I was writing. It's elegant and cool, (and could allow for some really nifty mechanic of Q where it gradually shifts the path of the arc over time. There were a few problems that sunk that, however.\n\nFirst off, to really have her feel like she's shifting between assassin and fighter, it's no good to have continuous, smooth transitions. Most of the time, she'd spend in some in-between state of half fighter, half assassin, which would be (like current Diana) really hard to make satisfying and balanced. Secondly, gradual changes are hard to notice, and lose out on clarity. If you don't know what her numbers will be for a skill without actively checking, that's bad.\n\nLastly, if I'm limited to numbers waxing and waning, I don't think I can get enough strategic differentiation between the extremes. Full Moon Diana should feel and be played very differently from New Moon Diana. I don't think you can turn a true assassin into a true fighter just by dropping damage and raising durability. I think you do need to implement actual mechanical changes.\n\nAgain following Riot's example with Gnar, I made sure that the passive, Q, W, and E all work pretty similarly between phases. I initially wanted to have the ults also be pretty similar, but Moonfall just feels so much of the full moon, and has so few levers that I couldn't see any variation of it that would work for the assassiny New Moon Diana. As ults are longer cooldown and allowed to be higher mindshare, I opted for two completely different abilities, each of which captures the essence of their respective phases.\n\nI'm not sure about having made her resourceless. I think that's a dangerous route, and it probably limits her itemization and puts an unnecessary damper on her power. But I'm not sure how to convey the time for her phase change without using the resource bar. If you have thoughts on that, I'd love to hear them.","replies":[{"poster":"Spinny J","date":"2014-08-06T19:23:20.353+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't really have any thoughts about her being resourceless, it doesn't seem to matter much in the jungle and it seems to me that it would expand her lane builds rather than limit them. Mana is typically (actually always) used to gate champions and I can't think of many combined AP + Mana items that you would get primarily for their non-mana stats. I'd much rather get a Nashor's on Diana than an Athene's, a Rylai's rather than a Rod of Ages, etc.\n\nI've been thinking a bit more, and I've had some thoughts/issues with certain aspects of both full moon and new moon Diana. Starting with full moon, I'm not seeing much point for her to go in if she doesn't have her ult. I mean, she's tankier, sure, but she's got less DPS than in new moon, and her only other form of CC is *ranged*, so she might be just a Q and Ult machine in this form, with some damage . Furthermore, I don't believe that more forms of CC is the answer. My impression is that when people think of Diana, they think of someone who kills her enemies. I can't remember who said it, but whoever they are they said it best when they said \"Diana did not destroy the Solari with a  Sunfire Cape\". A Diana whose primary function is to tank damage for her team-mates and act as a constant *disruption* in team fights just doesn't feel like Diana to me. Diana is out for blood; leave the protecting to Leona.\n\nPerhaps my concerns here are overblown, I don't think she'd really just be an ineffective utility tank. But my main worry is that both phases of Diana are just trying to do the same thing in different ways, and one of them will probably be better at it than the other, leading to one phase being thought of as the weaker of the two which she must suffer through. And mobile kill-you-myself Diana still feels more like Diana than slowing kill-you-slowly-with-my-team Diana. My off-the-top-of-my-head solution would be to make full moon Diana be about getting into the fight and dealing area of effect damage, while new moon Diana is what you described; a more mobile single target damage dealer. Maybe full-moon abilities would deal less damage, but have a wider area of effect, and I'd like to see some damage along with the vacuum on her ult, but that might be too similar to Ori's ult. Feel free to disagree with this assessment, I'm not really sure of it myself, just something to consider.\n\nI'm more sure about my problem with new-moon's mechanics though. Stealth, I think, is very nice to supplement a kit but shouldn't be a core aspect of its damage or survivability. If new-moon Diana relies on it too much, her counter-play becomes \"drop a pink, kill her dead\". The stealth on her W is nice; it's very useful for what she wants to do but not so essential that it's worth it for an enemy to buy a pink ward. Her ult though... If its main damage component is that she always gets passive procs when attacking from stealth, then removing that stealth renders her rather impotent, don't you think? The idea is great; quick and highly damaging attacks that also doesn't reward her for getting into an extended beatdown, but I don't think it'll work out that way in execution. As for an alternative, I don't have any ideas yet.\n\nMan, designing a champion is *hard*.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Estus Flask","date":"2014-08-06T01:42:11.751+0000","up_votes":31,"down_votes":6,"body":"I love Diana too (a bit too much), but I think that the main problem of her kit is that she's neither an assassin or a fighter, and fails to excel at both.\nFrom my perspective, of course. I'm no game designer, *but* I do play a lot of League and have studied the game's mechanic's in-depth (maybe a little too much).\nWithout further ado, here's my two cents:\n\n*Warning, I'm a big nerd so this will be a long read.*\n\n> **Why current Diana can't be a fighter/bruiser:**\n\n- **No sustain.** Most fighters have *some* sort of sustain. Be it being manaless, lifesteal/spellvamp, heal x ammount of health every y. She's veeeeery mana hungry and has no natural sustain, that's why she's so hard to play on early levels.\n\n- **Attack Speed is counter-intuitive to burst.** Attack Speed means high, sustained damage so you need survivability to be able to dish out damage. Burst is the opposite.\n\n- **Faceroll combo.** As much as I love Diana, there isn't much you can do besides Q, R, E, W, auto attack, Q, R. Most bruisers have some sort of combo-y mixup possibility with their abilities. Like Riven, Renekton, Zac, etc.\n\n\n> **Why current Diana can't be an assassin:**\n\n- **So-so scalings.** Most bursty assassins have really high scalings so they can burst people, Diana has \"meh\" scalings. (She can burst stuff when she's fed, but that's the thing, anyone who is fed is likely to burst.)\n\n- **Shield and CC are counter-intuitive to the assassin playstyle.** Assassins go in, *assassinate someone* and then leave as quickly as possible. *Not draw everyone into them.* Within this time, a shield is useless, as you want to get out as quickly as possible. Lets take for example Katarina. Does she have CC? Does she have a shield? No! She has abilities that lets her kill stuff quickly and get out. Which brings me to the next point...\n\n- **No reliable escape mechanic.** She has to land a Q, and then R into something. And that takes time. Assassins are on the clock. Why can't she reposition like Vayne, or use a Shadow like Zed, or Shunpo like Kat?\n\n> **How do we address these issues?**\nThe answer is obvious, *focus on one playstyle instead of making a weird functioning hybrid.* \nI present to you: **Bruiser-Caster Diana!** (I love Bruiser champions, let me be.)\n\n- ** Passive - Moonsilver Blade**\nEvery time Diana casts an ability her blade becomes empowered with moonlight, making her next auto attack deal extra damage and recover a little mana. If Diana stacks 3 Moonsilver Blade stacks, her next auto attack will slow the target, deal extra damage, and recover mana.\n\n- ** Q - Crescent Strike**\nDiana slashes the area around her, dealing damage to all enemies in an area. Enemies struck by this ability are revealed.\n\n- ** W - Lunar Rush**\nDiana makes a quick dash into a target location. Champion kills or assists reduce this this ability's cool down.\n\n- ** E - Moonfall**\nDiana draws all enemies around her, gaining extra Armor and Magic Resist for every Enemy Champion or Big Monster Pulled.\n\n- ** R - Scorn of the Moon**\nDiana calls for the power of the moon, empowering her and all of her abilities for x seconds. During this time, Diana's abilities cost no mana and have extended range, she also gains the ability to cast Eclipse.\n*THE SYMBOL ON HER FOREHEAD AND HER EYES WILL GLOW WITH SWEET-ASS MOONLIGHT DURING THIS TIME.*\n\n- ** R second cast - Eclipse**\nDiana becomes shrouded in Lunar energy, rises up in the air, and swiftly strikes in a moon pattern slash (Kinda like her current Q, but with shorter range and a wider area) that damages and knocks back all enemies in the area.\n\n\nLike I've said, I'm no designer but I do know this game.\nWhat do you think, IronStylus? Do you like my Bruiser Diana?\n\nAlso! Quick fix:\n> MAKE HER AND LEONA HAVE AN EVENT ALREADY\n\nEdit: I'm not a native english speaker so I'm sorry if I say something that feels out of place.\nEdit 2: I added a Diana portrait I drew to draw attention.\nEdit 3: Nerfs!

Diana is essentially a bruiser mage, but current itemization is not structured to really support that well, either she gets ahead and facerolls, or she gets behind and does nothing. \n\nMuch of the reason for this is because Diana has no escape, no jukes/dodges/whatever that don't just put her on top of a target to kill. It would be like trying to balance riven if her Q was a 600 range targeted dash. Indeed look at Riven's kit and look at Diana's kit. If Riven's Q were a 600 range dash they would be almost the same. They have a ranged nuke(riven's ultimate) they have a repeatable dash on a shortish CD which you play around to win. They have a shield which scales on their primary damage stat. They have a passive which increases their auto attack damage based on their primary build stat. They have a short duration PBAoE CC. Besides the dash differences and frequency of their ranged attack they are almost the same champion\n\nWell i don't really believe that riven is particularly powerful or OP. You can balance a melee fighter champion if they need to be mobile, smart, and quick in order to win fights. But in order for a champion to be mobile, smart, and quick to win fights they must have the tools to do so. Riven's Q is the tool that allows her to do that. Diana's ultimate is not the kind of tool that allows her to do that. Either she is so strong she can R in and just dominate, or she isn't strong enough and gets pummeled.\n\nSo here is what I would do\n\n1) Q,W,E, passive are unchanged... except for maybe (sorry) numbers\n\n2) Her ultimate becomes a short range untargeted dash that does low AoE damage. It works on a charge system with a charge reset every 5-10 seconds. Between charge uses it has an internal cooldown of 1 or .5 seconds. You also gain a charge if you hit a champion who has been tagged with your Q with a basic attack\n\nBasically, Diana becomes the AP equivalent of Riven, with her mobility unlocked at level 6. She had to dash around and dodge skillshots, weave abilities between her power in order to be effective. \n\nThis also has thematic power, as the moon waxes and wanes in power so does Diana's power wax and wane based on her charges, forcing a rhythm to her combat.\n\nPlus we will get to see Faker wreck fools with her so that is always a plus","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tahalden","date":"2014-08-06T07:02:38.517+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"There's a few things to consider in a new kit for Diana. \n1. To me, Diana is a fighter rather than an assassin. She has no way out, and a new kit would have to provide something like that. A shield simply isn't enough. Moreover, her Passive: Moonsilver Blade along with her E: Moonfall make her quite unique in League as it is, so it'd be nice to maintain that.\n2. There is the parallel with Leona to consider. Thematically those two are linked forever and ever, in being polar opposites. One's all about the sunrise, the other's all about the moonfall. That makes the vacuum ability a must have, because it just synchronizes well with the idea of moonfall. One could argue for an assassin kit to be an opposite for the tank kit of Leona; however Moonfall doesn't work with that. You can't assassinate the whole opposing team, right? \n3. Along the same line of thought, there's a bit of a parallel between both champions' kits. Both can shield themselves, both have a targeted gap closer, both have an aoe CC ability, and both have a passive that enhances auto attacks. Granted, Leona seems to be more focused on empowering her allies, while Diana is all about getting the job done herself.\n4. Crescent Strike is such a typical ability for Diana that it should stay, to make sure Diana's identity (champion wise/kit wise) is not lost. \n\nConsidering all this, it seems like Diana's current kit is coherent, with the exception of the ult. That being said, she does need a way to get into the fight as a fighter. This also leaves some room for a different ultimate that can emphasize her fighter identity rather than her assassin identity. So a new kit idea: \n\n* Passive: As before. Close combat through AAs is the way to go for Diana.\n* Q: As before. Still applies the Moonlight debuff.\n* W: As before. A shield is needed for Diana to function as a fighter in the midst of a team fight, and provides additional damage for close combat.\n* E: Here comes the gap closer AS WELL AS the vacuum ability. \n--- Lunar Rush: Diana closes the gap with enemy, without dealing damage. If the target is affected by Moonlight when using Lunar Rush, Diana gets a window of opportunity to cast Moonfall. Moonlight is consumed by Lunar Rush.\n--- Moonfall: The vacuum ability as before, with no damage. However, anyone who is affected by Moonlight is slowed by a scaling % for a short amount of time. Moonlight is consumed by Moonfall. \n(Alternatively, you could consider allowing Moonfall to pull in targets from further away if they are affected by Moonlight. However, if you've been hit by Crescent Strike, an intuitive reaction is to disperse. If Moonfall then pulls in targets further away, that goes against the intuitive reaction. Counterplay should be intuitive.)\n* R: Praise the Moon: Diana's attacks and abilities are empowered by the Moon. \n--- Diana's attack speed is increased by a given % for a set amount of time. \n--- Moonsilver Blade deals more damage to targets affected by Moonlight, but consumes Moonlight upon proccing this passive.\n--- The cooldown of the next Crescent Strike is reduced by half.\n--- Pale Cascade spawns more orbs.\n--- Lunar Rush has a cooldown of 1/2 seconds but does not allow Moonfall.\n\nSo what does all this mean? \n1. Diana has to make a choice about how to consume Moonlight. If she uses Lunar Rush, she will not slow the target with Moonfall. If she uses Moonfall, she'll not be able to do double damage with Praise the Moon and Moonsilver Blade before reapplying Moonlight with Crescent Strike. \n2. Moonfall is heavily gated. Diana cannot use it during Praise the Moon, and she can only use it after using Lunar Rush on a target affected by Moonlight.\n3. If Diana chooses to activate her ultimate before using Lunar Rush, she will not be able to use Moonfall. But if she Lunar Rushes in, then activates her ultimate, she will not have Lunar Rush available immediately. Again a choice the player has to make.\n4. Heavy focus on AAs, getting in, disrupting the enemy team and timing the passive with Lunar Rush.\n\nCheers IronStylus!","replies":[{"poster":"Scarthcaroth","date":"2014-08-06T12:11:43.374+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Diana's abilities always felt a bit \"weak\" compared to Leona who could call down a concentrated beam of sunlight to punish her opponents.\nIn contrast what does Diana have? Some fancy pale colored lights. That will surely strike fear into the hearts of all those that dare to oppose her and the glory of the moon...except it doesnt.\nSo here my attempt at creating a more \"Ultimate\" feeling to Diana.\n\n**Passive: Lunar Energy**\nDiana will no longer use Mana as her resource but Lunar Energy, specifically casting spells and attacking will generate more of this resource, in the same vein as fury. All her spells will apply Moonlight to her enemies.\nEvery X amount of Lunar Energy will heal Diana for a certain amount.\n\n**Q:Waxing/Waning/Fullmoon  Strike**\nDiana slashes her blade and creates a crescent of lunar energy damaging all enemies caught in the blast. Catching at least one enemy will mark them with moonlight giving her a brief period of vision and enable her to use \"Waning Strike\". Waning strike creates a similar crescent shaped blast but in the opposite way of the \"waxing strike\" meaning it comes from the left instead of the right. Waning strike will refresh moonlight on her targets. If she struck a target with Moonlight she will be able to use \"Fullmoon Strike\". Fullmoon strike damages enemies in a circular AoE in front of her and pulls them closer to Diana. \n\n**W:Moonsilver Blade**\nSimilar to her old passive every 3rd strike deals bonus damage and now she applies Moonlight as well on hit. Activating the ability will pull the target of her 3rd strike towards her.\n\n**E: Lunar Rush**\nIn essence the same as the current Lunar Rush except it can only be cast once you have tagged someone with Moonlight and only on someone who has been tagged with Moonlight.\n\n\n**Ultimate: Avatar of the Moon **\nUnlike Leona who ends up channeling the power of the sun directly on her enemies, in other words an external application, Diana will channel the power internally and become and Avatar of the Moon.\n\nIt consumes all of her \"Lunar Energy\" resource to facilitate the transformation/empowerment for a certain number of time.\nDuring this state enemies in a certain area around her have their vision radius reduced and are  permanently slowed.\nShe will periodically apply Moonlight to enemies in that area.\nAt the end of her transformation the Lunar Energy will burst forth from her and damage enemies around her.\n\nThis Diana is a more of Fighter/Initiator. I had someone in mind you couldn't get away from, someone who saw you at all times. Just like the moon. \nI want you all to imagine this picture of suddenly day turning to night being able to see nothing except this bright glowing warrior woman stalking towards you with cold fury in her eyes and the worst thing is YOU CAN NOT RUN!

Still get the same AS boost.\n\nLike it how it is, also have a few ideas as well.\n\n>Q: Also remains unchanged\n\nAgain, it's a cool part of the kit.\n\n>W: Instead of shielding, hitting an enemy with one of these orbs slows them. Hitting one champion with multiple orbs increases the slow OR it can add in other CC effects, such as silence or blind.\n\nThe context of this was that I always felt the two oddest parts of Diana's kit were her W and her E. Why does an assassin have an AoE pull like a tank/initiator? Why does a dashing, single-killing assassin have a shield like a bruiser or fighter? By removing the shield and putting in a slow, Diana has an easier time chasing down targets. In addition, the possibility of putting more CC on the orbs allows for a better sense of \"I should be hitting one target with all of these\" instead of \"I need to get rid of these and get my shield.\"\n\nThere's also the sense of counterplay. Block orb hits so your APC isn't silenced or your ADC isn't blinded. \n\n>E: Replace E with current R. Still refreshes when hitting moonlight targets but also lowers cooldown if you strike with passive. Probably increase cooldown/lower or remove damage to compensate.\n\nDiana's lunar rush is awesome but it never really felt like \"THE ULTIMATE\" ability. Sure it was cool dashing to targets but I never felt like \"This is the strongest power I have\" unlike other champions. Pushing it onto E will give Diana some pre-6 assassination capability while also allowing her to take advantage of some of her skills.\n\n>R: *Scorn of the Moon*- Diana brands an enemy with the mark of the Lunari. While branded, Diana has true sight of the enemy and deals increased damage to them. In addition, Diana has bonus movement speed/attack speed while within 300-ish yards of the target.\n\nWith the ultimate, I felt that there was some wiggle room to add in a type of assassin we hadn't had yet: The relentless pursuer. With this skill, Diana properly feels like an assassin and a woman with scorn in her heart. In my mind, the \"Lunari aura\" would be the recycled pull-icon on the ground. Furthermore, this would also play into Diana's lore as she too was branded and marked for death. \n\nI also feel it's a good tool to let supports/fellow team members know that \"Diana wants to kill this target. You should do everything you can to protect them and get them away from her\". Not to mention the idea of Diana's vengeful nature being taken out on one single target is friggin' awesome.\n\nSo, that's my idea.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nemadon","date":"2014-08-07T00:02:41.602+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":2,"body":"Moonsilver Blade:  Passive [**Every spell cast or basic attack adds (x) Moonlight Stacks to Diana's blade, upon reaching 100 stacks Diana gains a shield for (x) seconds and can activate her ultimate Moon's Descent(R).

By making Diana's playstyle a choice it fits the mold for both those who want to play her as an assassin, as you could channel your ultimate entirely on minions or jungle creatures to come into a fight already empowered by Forsaken, or you could be a front line fighter by soaking damage and gaining massive resistances and a persistent slow effect with One With The Moon.\n\nFlourish, besides a name change this ability is mostly the same, being the ability is the one that defines her the most, with most of it's power gone to Defiance or removed, and Pale Cascade being removed Diana's power has been lowered this spells power can be increased through both an increased hitbox/animation size; a full crescent moon perhaps; and increased damage. \n\nDefiance, removing Pale Cascade you remove Diana's invincibility when ahead, being an ability with no counterplay besides \"run\" is extremely frustrating.\nBy changing the damage to a sheen effect Diana is forced to autoattack in between spells in order to kill her target. Also the attack speed component is better here because you can now choose what you want to level up, CDR on Q, Attack Speed on W, or Burst on E.\n\nLunar Rush, this ability is now a skillshot and it's cooldown is not entirely negated by using it on a target afflicted by Defiance, having Diana's autoattacks consume Defiance it is another choice for Diana to make, decreased cooldown on Lunar Rush or more burst on a single autoattack?  This also gives Assassin Diana an escape, where Fighter Diana can't afford to wait for Defiance to go in.\n\nMoon's Descent, a slightly more powerful version of her current E, which opens into a new combo.

She waxes and wanes (Like the moon!) based off of what she does. Kill too many minions? She becomes weaker. Fire off too many spells. Also become weaker. She has to focus finding a balance, which I think works well with her theme as someone who is struggling to stay in balance. It would be interesting character-wise, as it gives her an internal conflict, fighting between become a a vengeful murderous person who slashes people to death, or becoming the embodiment of a peaceful moon, since right now, all her character is essentially \"Vengeance Vengeance Vengeance Vengeance I HATE THE SUN Vengeance Vengeance Vengeance Vengeance.\"\n\nI just love the ult idea, where instead of Diana doing burst damage, she just slashes and slashes and goes on this murderous rampage based off of how many people are around, so like if 5 enemy champions are hit by the first strike, she can just go on a murderous ultimate spamming AOE slashing spree to kill EVERYONE. Maybe throw in an evil laugh in there.\n\nAlso, I'm not certain on the Q: Crescent Light, and taking away it's damage. However, I did turn Pale Cascade into a ranged skill shot to compensate. Also, art wise, it might be cool to have the Pale Cascade actually show the phase of the moon that she is in, so that when she fires it at enemies, they can go \"Oh no!

WARNING: She'll be an assassin, but with a radically different kit, hopefully viable both mid and jungle.\n\nPassive: Moonlight: Several of Diana's abilities apply a Moonlight debuff for a few seconds, causing Diana to deal 15% increased magic damage to them for the duration (does not proc on Cresent Strike (Q) if it is the ability that applies Moonlight or on the first tick of Nightfall). If she hits a debuffed target with a basic attack, her attack speed is increased for a few seconds and she deals bonus magic damage on autoattacks for this duration. \n\nQ: Cresent Strike: Reduced travel damage but increased explosion damage and area of effect. Only applies Moonlight to enemies hit by the explosion. Is instant when cast from inside the Nightfall area. Now has a minimum range of ~300 (this change is mostly so you cannot simply blink to your target and THEN apply the Moonlight debuff with a guaranteed hit, while still allowing you to walk far enough away from monsters when jungling to hit them (except maybe wolves. Or maybe you just kill them before you need your second Cresent Strike. I don't know)).\n\nW: New Moon: Diana's next autoattack deals increased damage in a small area of effect around her target. If her direct target is debuffed by moonlight, this target is additionally slowed by a moderate amount for a few seconds, but the moonlight debuff is removed.\n\nE: Lunar Flash: Diana disappears in moonlight for a brief duration, then re-appears on her target with a blinding flash, dealing damage to her target and blinding everyone facing her (blinds her target if he faces the direction Diana was when she used Lunar Rush). After 5 seconds, Diana can use this ability again, but ground targeted and without blind, and with reduced damage, for two seconds. During those five seconds, the remaining cooldown is reduced by one second for every kill or assist Diana gains. (note: To be honest I am not too sure about giving her an ability with a blinding flash, thinking about her joke etc, but I felt like it fit. If it'd be better without, in my opinion it should also be best to name the ability Lunar Rush instead, like her current ultimate)\n\nR: Nightfall: Light dims as night comes, reducing the vision range of all enemy units by 10% (note: doesn't remove allied vision) and granting Diana full vision in an average area around herself (between vision range and twice this range). Within 5500 range, Diana can channel to brighten an area with a 600 radius (equal to Amumu ult) with moonlight, dealing average damage over a few seconds (say, 3-4), applying the Moonlight debuff and making the area visible for both teams.  Halfway through this duration, Diana teleports to the center of the area. She can then dash to an enemy debuffed with Moonlight once in the few following seconds, using a basic attack command. During this time, she will not automatically attempt to attack an enemy.\n\nThe thought behind this kit, is that you first have to hit your target with a ranged skillshot - Cresent Strike - and then can initiate with your (enemy-targeted, so not usable as escape) blink, which also deals damage, following another damage ability, this time with a slow to allow you to land more autoattacks. After a few seconds - faster if you do your job efficiently - you will be able to get out again, but you will not instantly be able to do this, so if you kill your target within a second, but then die within another, it's probably not worth it. If you, however, take two or three seconds for both (or buy a Zhonyas), it is. At the same time, however, crowd control may disable you from using the abliity, which could - if needed - have a brief channel time, say half a second. Either way, it should not be a free out of jail card. After level 6, you can also use your Nightfall to initiate upon an enemy while slightly hindering their battle field awareness and amplifying yours, and even apply Moonlight before using Cresent Strike.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Moonlight Fencer","date":"2014-08-06T05:12:09.214+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"As a Diana main, she is close to my heart, both in lore, and in gameplay. She's my favorite character by far, and I don't think she's suited to be a fighter at all. I think she should be an  assassin through and through, keeping high burst, moonlight crescents, and sticking potential to the game. She is angry at her betrayers and wants to relentlessly and quickly hunt them down. Not stay in a fight and take damage. Gameplay wise I think she is almost there and doesn't need major change, just a way to get out. As an assassin, that's pretty key, but I guess no escape is compensated for in her shield. Perhaps make her lunar rush targetable to allies and have a cooldown thing like yasuos e for ally cast and keep the moonlight proc for enemy cast. Then I would increase the range/slow on e just a LITTLE and I think shed be golden. Honestly I don't think there's need to change her too much because she's ALMOST there. But I'm open to almost anything as long as she remains a sticky crescent throwing gap closing assassin. I don't think she's meant to be a fighter in any stretch of the imagination, and I don't think shed be a fun fighter either.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cuix","date":"2014-08-06T02:23:31.846+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"**My Diana kit**\n\n**Passive - Cold Killer**: Upon taking damage from enemy units, Diana builds Emotion.

All units in moonlight receive bonus movement speed, including enemies.\n\n**W - Reckless Charge**: Diana dashes towards an enemy champion and deals a small amount of damage to them.\n**Empowered W - Umbral Assault**: Diana dashes towards an enemy champion, which is then feared for a short period and dealt a moderate amount of damage.

Maybe each ability could reflect a moon phase. \nSo while an ability could provide a lot of vision like a full moon does, an ability could also shut out vision like a new moon does in a similar mechanic to Graves' smokescreen. \nCrescent strike is also a cool feature and could use a little more love like maybe being able to teleport to where it finishes like Lissandra's E if Diana's Ultimate has the teleporting feature removed.\n\nWell, just a brief few ideas that popped into my head.

That feels like an important part of her identity.\n\nAttacking with her weapon is also important. She should be a champion who cares about her AA's. Making her AA's a more integral part of her kit is a good direction to go IMO. More then just 'do more damage'. What if getting the 3rd hit on a target marked by your ult applied a mini nocturne effect to the target?\n\nI think she is more suited to a fighter style then an assassin one.

There is no counterplay against her ultimate, and it forces Diana into the \"all-or-nothing\" style that she is notorious for. Her current kit lacks any real decision-making when it comes to how to use her abilities and makes playing as and against Diana a very shallow experience.\n\nThe concept for my Diana kit suggestion focuses on giving her mobility to maneuver into and out of fights instead of durability to stick around in a fight like a fighter. My concept also makes use of the popular idea of Moonlight procs for different abilities to give her meaningful decision-making in combat. Lastly, my version of Diana's ultimate is a buff (like Master Yi or Nasus) that gives Diana increased movement speed and further enhances her abilities.\n\n**Passive: Moonsilver Blade**\n> Every third attack cleaves nearby enemies with magic damage, additionally slowing any enemies afflicted by Moonlight and consuming the debuff. Diana gains bonus attack speed that is doubled while Enlightened.\n\n**Q: Crescent Strike**\n> Diana unleashes a bolt of lunar energy that travels in an arc. Enemies struck take magic damage and are afflicted with Moonlight, granting sight of them.\n**Enlightened**: Crescent Strike returns along the same path, dealing extra damage to any enemies hit a second time.\n\n**W: Pale Cascade**\n> Diana creates three spheres that orbit her, dealing magic damage to enemy champions or neutral monsters that make contact with a sphere. Diana gains movement speed for each sphere orbiting her. Spheres that make contact with enemies afflicted with Moonlight additionally heal Diana and consume the debuff.\n**Enlightened**: Diana creates three additional spheres (total of 6).\n\n**E: Orbital Sweep** (there is an image at the bottom of this post to better explain this ability)\n> Diana pulls enemies a short distance around herself in a counter-clockwise direction. Enemies afflicted with Moonlight are briefly stunned after being moved.\n**Enlightened**: Range and width of Orbital Sweep are increased\n\n**R: New Moon** (or Enlighten, can't decide)\n> Diana stealths and begins channeling. After channeling, Diana teleports to a target location, dealing magic damage and applying Moonlight to enemies in a small area. Diana becomes Enlightened for 10 seconds, giving her increased movement speed and augmenting her abilities.\n\nThe two major changes are with the new skills, Orbital Sweep and New Moon. Diana's current E (Moonfall) makes no sense for an assassin to have since it pulls in all enemies instead of the intended target. My suggestion (Orbital Sweep) attempts to fix this by giving Diana some decision-making when it comes to choosing how to use her sweep. Should she try to get alongside her target to push them back toward her team? Should she use it to push the rest of the enemy team aside from their carries? Should she try using it to shove an enemy across a wall? All of these questions, I think, provide for better play than \"I'm next to someone. I should press E.\"\n\nNew Moon is another major change that I am suggesting. My goal with New Moon is to give Diana a much more open-ended positioning ability with some potential counterplay. Did Diana just go invisible in a teamfight? Try dropping a pink ward and killing her before she teleports. Or use AoE CC on her location. On the other hand, Diana now has much more to think about when using her ability. Where should she choose to teleport to? Should she ult now or go behind a wall and teleport over?\n\nThis version of my kit may be overloaded with features, in which case I would take out the interactions that W and E have with Moonlight and just make W spheres always heal Diana. Ultimately I believe that my concept offers a fun, thought-provoking style of play for an assassin while maintaining healthy and meaningful counterplay against Diana.\n\nHope you all enjoyed the idea!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Felvyne","date":"2014-08-06T11:37:10.046+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"While assassin Diana is much fun...
