I know there's a lot of individual threads with suggestions. However..\n\nI'm looking to doodle some skins in my spare time. I know there's a TON of great community concepts out there. Some are serious, some are silly. I'm interested in what's floating around. Got any suggestions? I know there's individual threads, but sometimes it's hard to skim through them all D:\n\nTO CLARIFY! ***Ideas floated have no guarantee of actually happening.*** I'm just overall curious to see what shows up in this thread and what rises to the top, as well as maybe messing around with some ideas on my spare time.\n\nSome pro-tips:\n\n- While trolly ideas are great, but think of things that would really appeal to a wide variety of players. \"Cool\" is a subjective term, but ideate on things that would feel great on existing characters and would really add something special and appealing. \n\n- Think globally! That's an important aspect of skin development. While NA is where a lot of us on these forums live, we want to show love to the entire world! How cool were the Warring Kingdom skins? Wasn't River Spirit Nami gorgeous? Those are ideas inspired from cultures from around the world. If you are thinking of ideas that are more NA/EU derived, think of things that still appeal to the rest of the planet. Pool party skins are great examples. Everyone loves a pool party!\n\n- Preserve the character. While Eternum Lux might be a neat looking idea, does that fit Lux's personality or core character? Is it complementary or does it distract? Additionally, preserve the characters graphic reads. You probably don't want to change the size of Draven's blades too much, or make Jarvan's lance really skinny. You probably don't want to give a character that doesn't have a helmet something that blocks the face too much. \n\nAnyways, give it some thought! I'd love to see what the cream of the crop ideas of the community are!\n\nAnd as always...","replies":[{"poster":"Yak Chieftain","date":"2014-08-06T19:25:46.849+0000","up_votes":1196,"down_votes":32,"body":"Shinigami Thresh.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot JxE","date":"2014-08-06T20:38:25.558+0000","up_votes":308,"down_votes":6,"body":"This is amazing!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GG Beers","date":"2014-08-06T19:03:33.799+0000","up_votes":800,"down_votes":24,"body":"I always thought Crazy Cat Lady Yorick was one of the best skin ideas I've ever seen. http://37.media.tumblr.com/3d2611d642c3e5ec2372bbf97508a849/tumblr_mtzdibLfeN1s02hwfo1_1280.jpg","replies":[]},{"poster":"Praetercentor","date":"2014-08-06T19:26:25.047+0000","up_votes":500,"down_votes":9,"body":"My friends and I always used to call out \"Mr. President!\" when taking a skillshot for an ally (e.g. Cait ult, Ashe arrow) like a bodyguard taking the bullet meant for a VIP.\n\nNow that there's a champion whose kit basically revolves around doing this, I'd really enjoy seeing **Secret Service Braum** complete with sunglasses, earpiece, and a suit.  \n\nIf you wanted to get really patriotic with it you could deck out his shield in red, white, and blue and replace the ram with a bald eagle, but that might be a bit much...

A good example would be Riven where you can see her past as part of Noxus, then her exile leading to redemption. I would love to follow a champion's development especially for a champ I like. Of course, random non lore skins would still be awesome but I feel like skins would be a nice way to develop each champions story as a whole. \n\n\nP.S. here are some skin ideas I've collected over the years. They are from various artists and champs and I take zero credit:\n{{champion:254}} [Racequeen Vi](http://i.imgur.com/3oDZHIe.jpg)\n{{champion:113}} [Sejuani](http://i.imgur.com/aWTWZqW.jpg)\n{{champion:16}} [Demon Soraka](http://i.imgur.com/wRIHFjY.jpg)\n{{champion:89}} [Eclipse Leona](http://i.imgur.com/7s2unyH.jpg) Which I believe other people have posted\n{{champion:25}} [Wrath Morgana](http://i.imgur.com/6PX3U2d.jpg) which is an evolving skin [More wrath morgana](http://i.imgur.com/fVC087c.jpg)\n{{champion:80}} [Cyborg Panth](http://i.imgur.com/E8gQJpK.jpg)\n{{champion:92}} [Void Riven](http://i.imgur.com/dIjFNPP.jpg) [More Riven](http://i.imgur.com/5HqXZKr.jpg)\n{{champion:102}} [Battlecast Shyvana](http://i.imgur.com/Mzabsfj.jpg)[Human Battlecast Shyvana](http://i.imgur.com/8hAwTcQ.jpg)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fannygirdle","date":"2014-08-06T22:24:05.752+0000","up_votes":90,"down_votes":4,"body":"Brolaf was also a very popular skin. Why haven't you guys expanded that sort of \"Frat boy\" type line of skins? {{champion:77}} Dudyr anyone? I saw someone mention {{champion:201}} \"Bro\"um a few days ago as well, which would fit really well - Braum's shield made out of Graggy Ice boxes, he tosses Beer Cans instead of ice. And I mean, the puns just set themselves up. {{champion:31}} Bro'Gath, {{champion:3}} Galibro, and {{champion:35}} Shacbro...\n\n\n\nBeyond that, {{champion:61}} Orianna is in dire need of some skins. She has only 4 total, Gothic and Sewn Chaos being her launch skins, Bladecraft in 2012, and the limited TPA one, which was only a 750 skin. With all the potential for her skins, some amazing suggestions have come out. One of the best ones being Rococo Orianna, seen [here](http://lamierfang.deviantart.com/art/LOL-Rococo-Orianna-332159903) and Ballerina Orianna as seen [here](http://erina.deviantart.com/art/League-of-Legends-Orianna-252740283?offset=20). Either one of those would be incredible additions to Orianna's lacking roster of skins for such a great champion.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kylara","date":"2014-08-06T19:03:15.948+0000","up_votes":90,"down_votes":10,"body":"(Fenghuang) **Chinese Phoenix Anivia!** It would be perfect for the Lunar Festival. Basically, something in the style of the Fenghuang, which have these gorgeous, vibrant rainbow tail feathers, and a gold/multicolored, fiery body. This would be a way to either finally get the flame Phoenix skin with fire particles without just turning Anivia red, or you could bling it up and give Anivia metallic gold particles. (A gold ult pool would look amazing!) \n\nThis skin preserves the legendary creature feel to Anivia, where she is a mythological creature that has existed longer than just about everything else, across cultures and time. \n\nSome neat art examples here (none drawn by me, pulled off Google under the search term \"Fenghuang\").\n\n* http://fc03.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2012/347/c/a/fenghuang_chinese_phoenix_by_lioncrusher-d5nysuy.jpg \n* http://sunima.deviantart.com/art/The-phoenix-s-sword-351262031\n* This temple here: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/23/Longshan_Temple_-_Fenghuang.jpg/300px-Longshan_Temple_-_Fenghuang.jpg","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gucci Jorts","date":"2014-08-06T20:18:20.915+0000","up_votes":83,"down_votes":6,"body":"{{champion:131}}    \nI thought this was a super obvious candidate for the series of skins, but **Blood Moon Diana**. \n\nYou have so much potential in taking the flow and beauty of Asian influence and applying Diana's trademark zealous violence to the theme. While I like what was done with **Lunar Goddess Diana**, I feel like the team completely missed the mark in how Diana is ultimately a very pretty champion, but she is also *violent* and *vengeful*. She is a warrior.\n\nSome of my ideas for the skin:\n\n* The same color tones as the other Blood Moon skins: crimson and ivory.\n* Perhaps she could have a Kabuki mask, or heavy geisha makeup?\n* Her spell effects could be red :D\n\n**Blood Moon Diana** could very easily recapture both of those aspects of her character into one solid skin. IronStylus pls, I love this champion and she has so much potential.","replies":[]},{"poster":"I Drive A Sion","date":"2014-08-06T20:11:59.473+0000","up_votes":88,"down_votes":11,"body":"Think it's time for Trundle to get his justice... http://fc03.deviantart.net/fs70/i/2012/011/e/1/judge_trundle_by_mattcomgo-d4m2tyt.jpg","replies":[]},{"poster":"Deinonychusx","date":"2014-08-06T21:18:20.560+0000","up_votes":93,"down_votes":15,"body":"I'd really like to see this become a LeBlanc skin.
