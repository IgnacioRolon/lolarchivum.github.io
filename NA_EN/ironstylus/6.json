The Modern Man's Paladin.","subforum":"Story, Art, & Sound","up_votes":31,"down_votes":5,"body":"Hello again (again).\r\n\r\nSo something interesting came up in this thread:\r\n\r\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/story-art/HALQfHsu-marvelous-portrait-of-taric-on-surfer-singeds-updated-textures\r\n\r\nNamely, a discussion around hair. Yes. Hair.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_zaSKZks1A\r\n\r\nBur seriously, there's a thought swimming in my head about slanting Taric a little more \"modern\". Even the term \"metrosexual\" came up, mainly referring to a well-kempt, good looking gentleman that's fashionable and, for lack of a better term, \"modern\".  Some of my explorations lean this way. I'll emphasize **explorations** as this is super early concept stuff. \r\n\r\nIn part II of this discussion..\r\n\r\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/story-art/a7ulBkBM-so-what-do-you-guys-wanna-do-with-taric-part-ii-pics-or-it-didnt-happen\r\n\r\n..we talked about visual reference, asking what people were looking for in our favorite gem knight. A lot of fancy paladin art came up, sort of standard fantasy fair. The traditional suit of armor that's nicely ornamented and beautiful. But, it begs a question. What can separate Taric out from a standard paladin? One idea that's been floated in giving him that \"modern\" twist I mentioned. What does this mean? Well, it can mean a lot of things. One thing is his hair. Hair often can define modernity and current fashion trends. The way I perceive it is that the poof that Taric sorta has now dates him quite a bit. The suggestion was made to give him more of a modern cut, and therefore, give him more relatable, and current, style.\r\n\r\nI'm wondering that maybe we don't stop there. Maybe we push him to feel \"modern\" and fashionable all over. I'm not talking about futuristic, or runway high-fashion, but I'm wondering if it'd be a valuable exercise to ask for ideas about what people think a \"Modern Paladin\" could look like. Maybe supply some images that stress Taric's beauty and charm, but also set him apart from sword-and-sorcery fantasy. Not that that sort of fantasy is bad, but I'm looking to see what sort of spin we might be able to put on Taric that isn't just an armor set. I think exploring fashion, modern trends, and more contemporary looks might yield some results.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?","replies":[{"poster":"Hadriel","date":"2014-11-27T04:34:16.594+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"Contemporay would be good.

Long hair feels core to the \"serenity\" of Taric that I mentioned in other discussion posts - his hair is beautiful and it just happens that way. Less poof would be good, but I think long hair is something good to stick to. These examples mostly happen to be white guys, but I do think you can pull it off with a middle-eastern bent, which really is something I'd like to see in the redesign.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/jZtTngr (but less grim facially)\nhttp://imgur.com/IzzrQ6M (man buns?!)\nhttp://imgur.com/jR8Ibb5\nhttp://imgur.com/eo32b9v\nhttp://imgur.com/PXQr3Ik\n\nI'm not sure how I feel about the modern paladin idea. I think exploring what a modern paladin would be is certainly interesting material, but one thing that stuck out to me from the other threads was that people had a conception of Taric as being otherworldly, almost stuck in time - a typical Prince Charming type, perhaps even played to farce. I liked when the discussion was trending towards that, and being extremely handsome. That seems to contrast with a modern paladin. Both are interesting ideas to explore - maybe the modern paladin is more-so design-wise, but I feel like it runs counter to the character most people expect.\n\nP.S. Sorry to hear about Kiwi.

It is very well thought out and argumented.\nLoving how you integrated in the looks, that the name ''Taric'' sounds more eastern/southern, this also gives the opportunity \nto relate to the ''fire'' that often comes from these regions in our world, creating a so far unique reference. Also it can give a very believable impression of a deep/poetic/religious/charming character with an *intense aura* that pretty much should perfectly fit a paladin.\n\n> but one thing that stuck out to me from the other threads was that people had a conception of Taric as being otherworldly, almost stuck in time - a typical Prince Charming type, perhaps even played to farce. \n\nExactly. There is a certain core look, that Taric already has, and because of that people recognize him and love him. It is also important to keep it like the, lets call it ''Pillars of Sion''. Being undead and a juggernaut - so Taric needs long beautiful hair and some classical fantasy charming prince vibe, otherwise it wouldn't be Taric anymore. These things can stay and people even will recognize it, while his ''ethnicity'' is tuned/tweaked to more fit his core character!\n\nLets say Jaime (more modern and rough, still being a sir with elegance) meets Loras (classic kitschy prince charming including some surfer/sunnyboy vibe) meets Oberyn (about the fire which includes* accent*) add some vibe of the pictures shown above there... some '90's romantic novelle cover...\n\nKitschy and maybe a bit over the top, but believable, so you still can take the character serious. \nAlso the typical new League vibe that has been forged over the, I would say past two years, including recent champion releases and VU's.\n\n(Note: Currently I found out by accident, what all people meant by ''Fabio'' and it is exactly what I was trying to explain and really needs to be implemented in some way, it really feels totally core but should be much less cheesy... still having this over the top romantic and outdated charme tho.)\n\n\nThe whole ''modern paladin'' thing is a great idea, don't get me wrong. It just doesn't feel true to the core identity of Taric, when it comes to his hair, which already has a straight statement!\n\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT\n\nDon't forget that we have Jayce who is the modernized, rougher gentleman with vibe of the early/middle 20th century! It pretty much underlines that Taric should be kept the classic, fantasy kinda guy.\n\nThese two guys shouldn't collide, to again prevent homogenization.\n\n\nI currently see it with these cliche situation references:\n\n* Jayce being the roughter charmeur in a vintage bar, that protects a lady from a pushy douche bag while having an attitude like Han Solo, 007 etc.\n* Taric being the guy who comes ridden with a white horse, being overly polite and so on... Cavendish (One Piece), Oberyn, Loras, Jaime etc. \n\nWhich also means there can be similarities, but not intense overlappings in the character archetypes.\n\nLike mentioned earlier, a latin/eastern VO also would give Taric a totally new and easy recognizable archetype in some way, that isn't implemented in the game (if i remember correctly).\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso my condolence to Michael. Stay strong, you are not the type of person that should feel down.

If I'm not mistaken, the only other male champions in the game with long hair are Xin Zhao and Yasuo, who wear theirs in a pony tail.  Therefore I'd be somewhat sad and feel like part of his recognizability would be removed if his long hair was removed, but what he has right now feels really dated and is also badly rendered/animated.  However, I do really like what they did in Korra with the artsy son's hair (picture attached) and his eyebrow ring (though that likely would be hard to show on the in-game model).  The shaved side and eyebrow ring help add character to the silhouette due to asymmetry and they're also both very modern, and I think it would give Taric a lot of character and uniqueness.\n\nAs far as his armor is concerned, I think it'd be cool to keep some sort of asymmetry (opposite his hair asymmetry), so maybe have him with only one pauldron/epaulet, or have one a dragon or some other sort of mythical-inspired animal curled around his shoulders.  I think there's some cool space for accessories/garnish on his armor since he is a gem-knight, so don't be afraid to make him reflect some light.\n\nEDIT: Please could we also have him be a darker shade of tan/brown than other humanoid champions?

His walk must be courtly, his pose must be cambered.\nNoble: Noble is spirit and noble in form. He should feel like a socially-high-placed, yet humble, man. A true knight.\nLong hair: Straight or slightly curved, but long hair that go past his shoulders (Bloodstone Taric is a good example).\nCalm: Taric must feel calm and serene, he speaks slowly (please, keep his old voice!).\nImposing: He's stunning. His pose, his armor, his weapon impresses people.\nHammer: A paladin must have a hammer. It's kinda mandatory. A lance is good, though.\nShield: A shield is also required. A pretty big shield. (I know it looks a lot like a medieval paladin but a paladin without a shield is not a paladin)\nLight metal armor: Incrusted with gems, of course, but not a heavy armor, only a light, thin armor. Focus on the shield for the protection aspect.\nFashion: His stuff should be very aethetic, heavily decorated.\nand last word,\nGay: I know, some people don't like the gay/outrageous Taric, but it's an indivisible aspect of Taric.

Say, for instance, his shield is held on the side of his body that is more fully armored, being the side he holds up against oncoming strikes, while his hammer-wielding arm is a bit less shielded so as to be more dexterous.\n\nIn that way, you can mesh the more posh, 'fashionable' side of Taric with the bulky, slightly gaudy side that people have come to expect and love, in a way that still fits within his role and character.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PaintedFox","date":"2014-11-27T04:38:28.507+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alright, so what we need is to center around the gems (truly, truly...you get it) without making him look like a friggin stalactite. Streamlining his model (sanding him down, so to speak?) and making the gems feel like more focusing crystals than rocks is key here IMO.\n\nSpecific ideas? I'm assuming you look at WoW art (and we all know Taric is based in part off of that style); maybe we could shy away from the Uther/Maraad-style huge-shoulderpads-and-hammers idea and gravitate more toward a Blood Knight style, something subtle but still resolute. Something that doesn't need to be huge to be powerful. \n\nThe general concept I see is a silver armor, shiny but not huge and boisterous. I can see darker crystals than the pale...things he wears now; to show that they're living, could they seem to *grow* from where they are, per se? A polished look with a touch of natural-looking overgrowth from the crystals (I'm envisioning shoulder pads that rise vertically from the armor on the upper arms, rather than pauldrons--that'll slim the look down and make it look less bulky while also giving a great spot for a pair of huge, deep blue, radiant gems).

It really gave Taric a feel of being 'displaced'.  His old world probably idolized Freddie Mercury as the optimal height of fashion, and hence, why Taric looked as fucking fabulous as he did.\n\nSo he arrives on Runeterra, and all the Noxians have this grimdark fashion, and the Demacians are always dressing in bright blues and golds, Steampunk is all the rage over in Piltover... but Taric?  It felt like Taric was going to rock that sweet 70's hair and those fabulous gems until time stood still.\n\nTo me, Taric's aesthetic represents someone who doesn't fit in with the rest of Runeterra, but he is so unspeakably fabulous that he started trends all of his own, with young people thinking Taric is just the shit, and he's singlehandedly driving the price of gems up all across the world because people want to BE him.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lajinn5","date":"2014-11-28T10:29:22.347+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"When thinking of Taric I feel less armor made completely of gems, and more armor that is augmented with them.

As one person said before me, lighter armor with maybe a bit more towards his shield, and make the 'hammer' into an actual mace, or reduce the size at least, given that it's ridiculous as it is.

I personally believe asymmetry is a beautiful thing in fantasy. If the idea of asymmetry makes it in Taric's final (re)design, he has the potential of becoming this image of Gemstone fury. Looking fierce while bashing people with a giant gem hammer.\n\n[EDIT] \nIn my (humble) opinion, Taric has insane potential of becoming a really cool character. Now, currently he is kinda jokey and fun. Sort of like Sion was (R.I.P Aahnuld). I think the beauty of Taric's potential is that he can be redesigned as a kick butt character, while retaining the jokey feel that makes him, him. ","replies":[]}]}]}
