GET IT? Anyways..) of ideas and suggestions. The sentiments and discussions are absolutely fascinating and extremely helpful. I'm always floored by how insightful and thoughtful, you, our players are, and how in depth you go. You have no idea how valuable that insight is.\r\n\r\nWhat I'd like to ask for here is reference. As artists we constantly look at reference imagery for a number of reasons. Sometimes it's to look at anatomy, to make sure we're creating a body correctly. Other times it's for light or color, so we can see how a scheme will serve an illustration. In this case however, I'm looking for design reference. \r\n\r\nWhat does that mean? Armor! Gems! Motifs! Flourishes! Portraits! Anything that could be pointed to and said \"Hey, I think Taric could incorporate elements from this!\", or, \"This image really hits me in the feels, those are the sort of feels I want to feel when I look at Taric.\" \r\n\r\nSo while the last thread (which is still going strong, please continue to post in there) there was a lot of visual suggestions, explanations in written format sorta dominated. That's totally fine. Here I'd love to see you throw some images at me! \r\n\r\nThanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Delirious Wizard","date":"2014-10-08T08:17:28.967+0000","up_votes":86,"down_votes":7,"body":"Honestly expecting some incredibly majestic hair.

Put it in the face. Kinda like with Ezreal, but... Very different appeals. \n\nI feel like Taric is a champion that, if he were to be the \"sexy one\", it would be subdued slightly. He wouldn't show it off blatantly, but he might just put a few reminders out there of how pretty he/his gems are. My reasoning falls into his current image: he has a smooth, silky (creepy, if you ask me) voice, the potential for a pretty face in his artwork, but he doesn't let this show. He talks about his gems a lot, as he seems to be proud of it, so he's subtly showing these things about himself off.","replies":[]},{"poster":"King Oberjohn","date":"2014-10-08T12:33:54.852+0000","up_votes":34,"down_votes":4,"body":"I think Taric should be gallant and charming, not sexy. \n\nBy sexy meaning show off or seductive, kinda like MF is. \n\nHe can remain attractive, but trying to make him sexy can backfire on the character.

I personally love the Fabio, open shirt, flowing hair them. Taric is the hot guy riding a white horse down on the beach. The guy that be you male, female or otherwise will sweep you off your feet. Not just because he's gorgeous but because he's such a damned sweet person. \n\nTo me, Taric thematically is INVITING. No matter who you are, Taric is inviting to you. And there's a number of reasons for it. His handsome face and gorgeous hair, the sound of his voice, his kind words, his battle prowess, his ripped body, all of that. Taric should be the \"heart throb\" of League. \n\nHe's the type of individual you look up to and admire and just want to connect with. For those of us that are old enough to have experienced many different personality types, we've all known that person before. That was just magnetic! \n\nAs far as the sexuality thing goes, in a few short months it's gonna be 2015. A gay character can just BE a gay character. Many other games have gay, lesbian, bi and trans characters in their roster and they're loved nonetheless. There's no need to just \"imply\" it to keep from getting any backlash. As to whether it adds to or diminishes the value of the character by aligning him directly, I think is an invalid question. The real question is how does it add to or diminish the views of Riot Games as a company on the issue of sexual expression. And that's a question that needs to be answered in-house. \n\nI think it'd be a great opportunity to say hey, this character is gay, slightly flamboyant and an absolute BADASS on the battle field.

His gentleness comes from a genuine caring heart, not from a noble upbringing.\n\nChivalry and noble gestures are social acts, and they are chiefly meant to impress and charm. Taric doesn't need to do that. He doesn't charm, he *is* charming on his own. It's in the simplicity of his gestures where the appeal lies, not on the elaborate traditions or ceremonies. Chivalry has a kind of theatricality built in it, where a sort of performance is put on display. Everyone knows the rules, what is expected, how to respond to this or that gesture, what to do in this or that event, and it's all so very constructed.

Even for the sexual-type characters like Ahri, it's never said who she preys on. For all we know, she could prey on anyone, female, male, alien, human. Vi could be a lesbian, Janna could be bi, Ezreal could be pan, and who knows, maybe someone like Shaco or Mundo is trans. The point is, these are all headcanons, they're never explicitly stated. \n\nI think Riot did this intentionally, and I both agree and disagree with it.

Functional and stylish. Iron Stylish? I digress. \n\nI consider the two attached images to deliver well upon this, utilizing shapes and/or color to bring as much design language in as possible. The chunky shapes in the FFXIV image (Paladin) read very strongly to me, but I wouldn't be afraid of the going more towards the Dark Souls 2 direction for his joints and midsection for ease of moment. \n\nOf course, gems are a major factor for Taric. Specifically gems. Right now, he has a crystal motif, which communicates a very wild and raw nature. With the tepid manner of speech that he has right now, Taric feels much more refined to me. To that effect, I feel that faceted gems communicate this much more clearly. In addition, the facets would allow him to dazzle even brighter. Functional, and stylish.\n\nAs a final point, I feel that the crystal sword in the bottom right of the FFXIV image is cool to me.

The mace feels better because it is blunter (literally and metaphorically). It isn't going to slice someone up, you can use it to tap them, push them over, bash their skull in, etc. However, I can't recall if this is in his ult animation, but how he smashes his hammer for his ult is very, very important for me.

In gameplay sense, I would assume this would reflect on a more supportive style of play, not just a tanky playstyle. I feel like the overall image of Taric would be pretty different, but if you kept the gems, and maybe just made the hammer smaller, then it could potentially work.

Brad Pitt, Siegfried Schtauffen (Soul Calibur Franchise), the Wizard from Dragon's Crown.  \n\nAs another player pointed out, Taric is the Gem Knight.  Gems are formed under pressure.  Taric should show that pressure somewhere, most likely his face since I'm assuming that will still be visible.  Taric should show that pressure in the way he carries himself as well, the way he moves, the way he stands, the way he talks.  Taric is a warrior, a soldier.  He's seen the effects of war and the battlefield and yet he still appreciates the beauty in simple things (gems).  \n\nI can imagine Taric taking a moment after surveying a battlefield to appreciate a flower growing against the grey background.  There's a maturity in there.  He hates war but he knows it's something he has to do.

Taric looks should show he invests some time in looking perfect, and shine like a ~~diamond~~ gem.\n\nSo about that, Trevor from Castlevania: Mirror of Fate looks like a good reference to me, paladinesque look and long magnificent hair.\n\nhttp://www.gamers.vg/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/mirror.jpg","replies":[]},{"poster":"ShadowKnight1224","date":"2014-10-08T08:36:05.764+0000","up_votes":41,"down_votes":8,"body":"I will probably make another post about the gems and the armour/hammer/shield, etc. I just wanted to get the male models out of the way.\n\nGeneral look:\n\nhttp://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Cn9Jlk1pxZ0/T8_uV7FUhuI/AAAAAAAAAtA/kDqWlthSzFw/s1600/Nova.jpg\n\nAttractive, charming, gentle. Eyes looking directly at you, but his facial expression is neutral to slightly awed/interested.\n\nFacial structure:\n\nhttp://bookishtemptations.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/20130422-132045.jpg\n\nLight-coloured eyes (but not blue or green). Gray, amber, light hazel, something that looks good but is understated (pure green and pure blue are too attention-catching, dark brown is too dull).\n\nSymmetrical face with no sharp cheekbones or hard jawlines, clear handsomeness in the harmony of his features. If there's any facial hair, it's similar to Yasuo's, in that it's not a proper beard, but more like a lack of shaving. Taric being Taric, however, the facial hair is still deliberate and does not grow wildly, but instead has specific shape that enhances the natural curve of his jaw/cheeks.\n\nPossible Middle-Eastern influence:\n\nhttp://i.ytimg.com/vi/OBInOV_NFOM/hqdefault.jpg\n\nSlightly thicker lips than Europeans, darker skin tone, thicker eyebrows. Of particular interest is the shade of hazel of the eyes. Understated, but still light enough to be attractive. Also note the deliberateness in facial hair.\n\nhttp://cs320517.vk.me/v320517711/2c9d/j-oa_m1UkDQ.jpg\n\nNote again the facial hair, the lips, the particular shade of his eyes and skin.\n\nHair:\n\nSome ideas for hairstyles that might work in a new look:\n\nhttps://s-media-cache-ec0.pinimg.com/236x/9b/da/61/9bda61e2231b3e28904b298814c03b15.jpg\n\nShorter hair, but straight and kept relatively neat, but still in its natural state. Low risk but perhaps boring choice.\n\nhttp://iv1.lisimg.com/image/2250137/600full-mario-blanco.jpg\n\nShorter and curlier hair, loose and wild, appeals to the idea of the wandering knight. Might be difficult to render and clash with the idea of Taric and neatness.\n\nhttp://cdn1.menstylefashion.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Long-hair-is-back-for-men2012.feature.jpg\n\nLonger style, straight, but wild. The wildness and windswept-ness may allude to Taric's lack of a true home and wandering nature, but the length and straightness balance out his calm and neat personality.\n\nhttp://iv1.lisimg.com/image/4794537/600full-douglas-hickmann.jpg\n\nLonger and wavier, but not windswept. Instead, it frames his face. Rather than a straight, lifeless curtain, he has rich, wavy hair, arranged in a way that is not obsessively perfect but not completely wild.\n\nBodywise:\n\nhttp://media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/f1/4b/31/f14b31eba20762f94ed128a4fb6e7549.jpg\n\nThis would be the expected. Not as buff as Braum, but clearly a tanky, strong melee fighter that can hold his own and look good while exerting himself in battle.\n\n*-*\n\nI think I've made my point in terms of looks, I'll get back to the outfit/gems in another post.

Laptop shut off :(\n\nTaric is gay. The fandom and your insulting skins made him that way. It'd be less insulting if you actually made him gay, instead of implying it and making him do \"gay\" things.\n\nTaric shouldn't wear heavy armor. He's too elegant for it and his gems soak up all the damage. He should wear noble's clothes and possibly summon magic gem armor. HE COULD EVEN RIDE A GEM.\n\nMaybe his playstyle could be summoning physical gems (sort of like trundle's ice thing) that would radiate health regen/mana regen/armor/ windwall esque/ mini turret. He would play like a defensive azir. He'd place these gems down (armor near him, health regen near adc) and the duo bot would have to think harder about where to position themselves most advantageously. Maybe for his new ult, there would be ley lines that are created that even more benefits (or even detriments!) between them.\n\nI'll post some ideas of what he should look like in the other thread ^_^","replies":[{"poster":"LockendesLicht","date":"2014-10-08T14:28:10.945+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":2,"body":"Like being gay itself is a bad thing! -.- ''''\nMaking him sort of gay is insulting.

But I love the idea of his abilities changing color to go with the various gem sayings. \n\nI guess what I'm asking for is more gem interaction. Not just him saying Gem related things but I want there to be better visual aspect. I GOT IT! When he buys items have a line of gem related things be said. So Ruby based quotes when buying health items. Emerald based ones for wards. Opal for some AP based items. Sapphire for mana based items. And some other gem for AD based items just to round it out. \n\nNot sure what but this is something I really like about Taric since I'm a fan of gemstones in life.
