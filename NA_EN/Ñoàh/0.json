It makes me update for the new client, and when I hit Launch, the noise it makes when being pressed occurs but then gets cut off, and the game does not launch, no matter how long I wait. I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling, hitting the repair option in the Launching Client (it says nothing is wrong), I downloaded Adobe Air (Which is says it requires when you are installing League), and have Directx12 (My brother also has Directx12 and runs League so that isnt the problem). Also whenever I have to download the new client, later the app icon for League will turn into a white page with a folded corner. I have not seen anything that will help fix my problem since this is a problem that happens with the new client, so that is why I came to forums for help. Anyone who have the same problem or ideas on how to fix it?\n\nEdit: Also, I checked and you don't need Adobe Air for the new client, but still, before it didn't work.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-23T22:04:17.319+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmmm that's kind of weird that the updated client isn't updating the shortcut icon on your desktop correctly for some reason. That makes me think that the client update might not have completed 100% correctly due to some [**permissions**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) issue. Run through that guide really quick and let me know if adjusting those settings is able to help at all.","replies":[{"poster":"Ñoàh","date":"2017-06-24T01:42:15.806+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I managed to fix it by using the Hextech Repair Tool and doing a clean uninstall and some other stuff, thank you for viewing my post however because I had this problem for about a month and couldn't play League.
