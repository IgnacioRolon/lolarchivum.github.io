Often several times a game. Im not using wifi, and I have good internet (and can play other online games just fine). I fix this by alt+f4 out of the game, and reconnecting. Gets me back within 20 sec or so, still often die because of this.\r\nDoes anyone know what the issue might be? Perhaps im missing some files or something?","replies":[{"poster":"MeSaSC2","date":"2017-08-17T20:36:19.968+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm having a similar problem. Right after I login to the game, I get the \"trying to reconnect\" error. It started from yesterday. Sometimes, after a while it finally connects and I have no problem playing the game afterwards. I get this problem only after logging into the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-08-16T22:53:47.840+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your connection is likely unstable, so there's some uncertainty when it's kind of going to crap out again.  Your best bet would be to run through the steps in the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to troubleshoot.  Though your internet is okay, you can still have trouble reaching specific servers.  Let me know if that clears things up!","replies":[{"poster":"Renlen","date":"2017-08-17T02:57:01.551+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But why doesnt the game just think for a sec and reconnect? \nI mean I did some of the stuff in the link you mentioned but it doesnt help. I doubt its my firewall, and i doubt ports need forwarding so i didnt do those. Network drivers are also up to date. Not using VPN either...\n\nThis sometimes happens multiple times in a game, sometimes not at all","replies":[]}]}]}
