So I'm pretty sure that everyone has their client crash in the loading screen, pre game, etc... but it happens too often to me. I also cant count the amount of times I have lost a series because the game crashed in the middle of champion select. Riot is coming out will all these updates and bug fixes but I think they are neglecting the true inconveniences to players.  It's honestly making me no longer want to play this game when I get penalized every time my game crashes and I have no control over it. I am running a perfectly good setup for my gaming laptop and ISP, yet again... I keep getting fucked over.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-15T21:00:48.603+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hearing that you're crashing so often brings me no joy, and I'd like to help if I can.  Even if your laptop and ISP is in good condition, there might be some hiccups that are causing the game to not render properly.  Sometimes it just needs a small tune-up like updating your graphics driver, and I would recommend trying that as a first step.  Please check out our [Game Crash](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes) guide and go through the steps provided to fix this for good.  The game is always changing and updating, and that guide can help you prepare for that.  Please let me know if your issue persists after this.","replies":[]}]}
