It used to minimize my league window and say it crashed, and somtimes while in champ select or even before a match. I still every now and again get dissconnected from the PVP service too, recently it's now gotten to where after match the game is just closed out so I can't even get to the screen with the champion scores and the last chat with home or play again... I'd like to know what is going on with this. Please and thank you.","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2013-09-23T19:21:26.370+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Raigen,\n\nAfter reading your post, this strikes me of a connection issue that is causing these errors to occur either in the Client with PvP.net has connection issues, or even errors/crashes in Champion Selection.
