While errors in the Log-in screen may be indicative of a connection issue, this is not always the case.  I strongly recommend that you try completing the following steps, which should hopefully allow you to log-in normally:\n\n1)  Sync your Windows Clock - https://support.leagueoflegends.com/entries/20201443-syncing-windows-clock\n\n2) Confirm that your Internet Explorer options are set up correctly - https://support.leagueoflegends.com/entries/21931765-Windows-Settings-Troubleshooting\n\n3) Make sure that following certificates in IE are turned off.  You can find the certificate option here - IE Options > Advanced > Restore Advanced Settings, IE Options > Advanced \n\n*  \"Check for server certificate authentication\"\n* \"Check for server certificate revocation\"\n* \"Check for publisher's certificate revocation\"\n* \"Warn about certificate address mismatch\"\n\nI hope this helps!  If you are still experiencing issues logging in, make sure that you submit a new ticket to Player Support, which you can find here:\n\nhttps://support.leagueoflegends.com/tickets/new","replies":[]}]}
