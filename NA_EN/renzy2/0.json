Until tonight, it would happen a few times in game and my ping would go up to around 300-900 each time, but then shortly return to normal. Nothing too unmanageable I'd say.\r\n\r\nHowever, today, as shown in the link above, I've started getting DEBILITATING ping spikes and connection issues. The screenshot shows the logreader of my first game, in which I disconnected right off the bat and had to re-connect 4 times. Each time before the final time resulting in me having ping of over 3000+ although for some reason the log doesn't show that. As well, the game right after that one shown on the log reader here https://gyazo.com/6cc646cee8d48e961274f1d343b01d91 started out fine. But about halfway through my ping skyrocketed to 8000+ and only fixed after I relogged into the game. Both of these logs show almost NO packet loss, but still my ping skyrocketed. \r\n\r\nI'm almost positive it isn't on my end either. As I tried to play another few games on my computer and each one was within normal bounds of ping for my internet. Please help or suggest reasons why this may be happening.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-17T20:54:34.912+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It looks like the game in the 2nd picture should have played rather fine from what the logs said. However, the packet loss in that first log is more than likely the cause of those ping spikes. Packet loss means that some of the data being sent to and from our game server is getting lost along the way, which can cause some pretty weird stuff. \n\nHit us up in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and our tech guys should be able to go over those logs with you and get to the bottom of those ping!","replies":[{"poster":"renzy2","date":"2017-04-18T00:03:56.549+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So a raise from 1% packet loss to about 3% packet loss can cause that high of ping? I didn't know that. I will place a ticket and see how things go, thanks for the reply.","replies":[]}]}]}
