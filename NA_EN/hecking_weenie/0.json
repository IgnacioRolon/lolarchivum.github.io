Whenever I opened the client, it would tell me after a few seconds (whether I was logged in or not) that I couldn't connect to the League servers. It prompted me to either restart or shutdown the client. I tried restarting a few times, but the error continued. I ended up going to this page: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761944-Login-Issues to attempt to fix this issue, but none of the solutions worked. I also tried the Hextech Repair Tool, but none of the fixes on that worked either. So I ended up attempting to reinstall League fresh (because whenever the Hextech Tool tried it failed for some reason). After I reinstalled the game, I attempted to launch it from the client I was able to use (the old one), but it just gave me the RADS error. I then went around to try and solve that as well. Now a day later, I have the game reinstalled, possibly even have the disconnecting error fixed (or maybe Riot fixed it in the time I was away), but I'm still getting this RADS error.\r\n\r\n**Things I've tried to fix the RADS error:**\r\nI tried launching the game as administrator as well as launching the admin client. _Didn't work._\r\nI tried setting my DNS like basically every solution I found said. I set it too 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4 as well as one said to try 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.8.4. _Didn't work._\r\nI attempted to resync my PC's clock (like it said to do on the support page), but I encountered a problem with it. I never actually found any sort of update button to force an update manually and if I tried to do it through the command prompt it gave me this: \r\n> **System error 5 has occurred. Access is denied.**\r\n\r\nI also tried to resync through the Hextech Repair Tool, but that just gave me another error.\r\nI couldn't update Internet Explorer, because I'm on a Windows 10 computer and that was replaced with Microsoft Edge. \r\nI tried launching League with Microsoft Edge open. _Didn't work._\r\nI tried this even though it was from 2012: http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=2540385 , but I couldn't find the listed \"rads_user_kernel.exe\" file they where speaking of. Most of the other solutions where either impossible to do, or just didn't work.\r\nI tried this: http://forums.euw.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=1435570 ,  but I changed the file to note that I'm on the NA servers instead of the EUW servers. Didn't work.\r\n\r\nIf there is anyway to possibly fix this I would appreciate it a great deal. If any more information is needed let me know. I'm not the best when it comes to troubleshooting, so I don't know if I did everything the way I was supposed to.\r\n\r\nAlso apologies for the wall of text, I just wanted to give as much information as I could on my situation.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-24T04:02:09.879+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There could be a number of other network settings that can potentially conflict with League.
