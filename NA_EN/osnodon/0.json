If we have 1 person that is feeding and has like 1 kill and 7 deaths to the same nme champ sorry but I will leave the game if you dont surrender at 20 minutes. And i should not be penalized for that either because im not staying another 15-20 minutes and get like 30 ip for a 45 minute game because of a noob that doesnt know how to play.","replies":[{"poster":"Jo0o","date":"2016-09-24T14:29:23.285+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I won four ranked matches in a row yesterday, and in two of them, we had people like you spamming ff and threatening to AFK just because we were losing at times. \n\nLeague is an easy game to stage a comeback in. Catch the enemy team out of position and unleash a nice combo on them, and suddenly you've shaved 2k gold off their advantage and took dragon and two turrets. Ace them in your own base at 50+ minutes, and it's you that's winning the game, not then. And once the game has gone past 45-ish minutes, everybody is full build anyway and gold advantage doesn't really matter.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2016-09-24T10:16:33.078+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I havr won lots of games where we had bad starts like that. Actually i won one just yeaterday against a 9/0 kha zix 10 minutes in or so.\n\nJust because you don't want to play the game doesn't mean you should ruin 4 other peoples games.\n\nI honestly hate surrendering in almost every scenario. The only times I have even been slightly upset with a failed surrender vote is when I am very tilted and need to take a break, and that is my fault not my team's.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Osnodon","date":"2016-09-24T08:54:30.994+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"so report me for leaving if you dont ff at 20 and report me and report the person for feeding\nat that rate league of legends will have no players left ggwp","replies":[{"poster":"Corporal B","date":"2016-09-24T09:35:37.524+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Osnodon,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=k9s4AY39,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2016-09-24T08:54:30.994+0000)\n>\n> so report me for leaving if you dont ff at 20 and report me and report the person for feeding\n> at that rate league of legends will have no players left ggwp\n\nOkay, you got it sir!
