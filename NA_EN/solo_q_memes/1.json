I play Wukong and I know Wukong isn&#039;t a strong champion, especially not against something like Garen, but seriously why are towers so useless in protecting me. That champion does not need to respect me, my tower, no where in lane is safe after 6. It is pretty disgusting to play against to be honest. The only hope is to sort of take what you can get, while knowing that you need to forfeit a lot of farm and eventually forfeit tower. If he charges you with Q under tower, just leave your own tower even if you are at full hp. He will deal more damage to you in 1 Q then the tower will deal to him in 2-3 tower shots. Besides he heals it back easy anyway. This has been my experience playing Wukong into a Garen that knows just how much he can bully me in lane. Truly unsatisfying gameplay.","replies":[{"poster":"5050BS","date":"2018-11-14T04:56:11.457+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yep and it will still be the same in S9 GG Riot","replies":[{"poster":"Critmaster Garen","date":"2018-11-14T05:02:16.795+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=XXXMurderPenguin,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=2tEodJEs,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2018-11-14T04:56:11.457+0000)\n>\n> Yep and it will still be the same in S9 GG Riot\n\nhopefully. yes.\n\nthis isnt a garen problem, this is a wukong problem.\n\nhe started as a fighter, then got nerfed until the only way to keep himself viable was to play him as a gimmicky lethality stacking assassin, then he got nerfed for that aswell.\n\nwhat do you expect?\n\neven as an assassin, {{champion:62}} doesnt compare to the likes of {{champion:91}} {{champion:238}} {{champion:84}} who have the same burst and better outplay tools.\n\nthe problem is that the champion completely lost his identity as a diver.\n\nif you nerfed garen, then wukong would still get shit on by any other top lane champion like \n{{champion:14}} {{champion:39}} {{champion:24}} {{champion:6}} {{champion:41}} {{champion:36}} {{champion:31}} {{champion:78}} {{champion:57}}  hell, whatever else you could run in that lane.\n\nthe only thing that can help wukong now is a {{champion:5}} level rework, with most of his abilities the same, but being able to be a diver again.","replies":[{"poster":"Solo Q Memes","date":"2018-11-14T05:19:25.711+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Critmaster Garen,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=2tEodJEs,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2018-11-14T05:02:16.795+0000)\n>\n> hopefully. yes.\n> \n> this isnt a garen problem, this is a wukong problem.\n> \n> he started as a fighter, then got nerfed until the only way to keep himself viable was to play him as a gimmicky lethality stacking assassin, then he got nerfed for that aswell.\n> \n> what do you expect?\n> \n> even as an assassin, {{champion:62}} doesnt compare to the likes of {{champion:91}} {{champion:238}} {{champion:84}} who have the same burst and better outplay tools.\n> \n> the problem is that the champion completely lost his identity as a diver.\n> \n> if you nerfed garen, then wukong would still get shit on by any other top lane champion like \n> {{champion:14}} {{champion:39}} {{champion:24}} {{champion:6}} {{champion:41}} {{champion:36}} {{champion:31}} {{champion:78}} {{champion:57}}  hell, whatever else you could run in that lane.\n> \n> the only thing that can help wukong now is a {{champion:5}} level rework, with most of his abilities the same, but being able to be a diver again.\n\nI agree.

Not even my tower keeps me safe, If I go in for a single minion his Q deals an insane amount of damage. It feels like a hopeless lane, and to this extent I just laugh to myself because there is literally nothing I could do. He just steamrolls me and there is absolutely nothing I could do but play as safe and far away from him as possible. God forbid I do well mid game out side of the lane, because then I'd get marked as the villain.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Critmaster Garen","date":"2018-11-14T04:53:52.588+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Solo Q Memes,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=2tEodJEs,comment-id=,timestamp=2018-11-14T04:28:58.397+0000)\n>\n> Oh and tower damage? non existent to that champion.

My main Ekko I can usually trade and beat him until about level 4-6, when he can Silence me and then absolutely destroy me with damage and even if I trade its like I am throwing pebbles at a tank and he is cutting me like a hot knife through butter. But this is why he suffers from champs he can be so easily kited from like Gnar, Quinn, and so on. Honestly I would not have a problem with Garen if he built tanky but did little damage but that is not the case. For example I went top lane Ekko and I got First blood and another kill on him, but as soon as he got a shroud I did little damage to him while he was melting me.  They need to lower his base damage and increase his damage from bonus AD and this will fix a lot of his problems.","replies":[]},{"poster":"So Sorry Eh","date":"2018-11-14T16:50:51.309+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a garen player I see what your saying. I crapped all over a wukong with fizz last night as well. Wukong seemed real weak. But like any other matchup you could be stuck under tower for a bit and while I agree the towers havent been dealing enough damage to help out you still need to find ways to outplay the other champ. Dont use abilities to CS if they can help you possibly escape. Just gotta be patient and call for ganks. Take advantage of abilities on cooldown. Or try something new and just take him into another lane. You can pretty much try anything new these days and adapt it to your playstyle to succeed.
