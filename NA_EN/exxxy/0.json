In character select it doesn't show up under wards either. Help please, is it just gone forever? I've tried restarting and It seems to just have disappeared.\r\n\r\nThis is the only screenshot because I took it to save how weird it was, I didn't know it would disappear so didn't take anything other than this sadly. \r\n\r\nHopefully I can get some help, it would mean a lot. Thanks in advance.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-08T20:13:14.409+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The ward is still on your account but what you're experiencing is a visual bug that prevents it from showing up on your profile or in champ select. We're aware of the issue and are working on a fix, but there currently isn't a timeline on when one will roll out. Sorry about that, I really like the gingerbread ward and it's limited so I know you wanna rep it and show it off!\n\nEven though I'm not able to resolve this issue immediately, please let me know if you have any other questions for me.","replies":[{"poster":"Exxxy","date":"2016-08-10T01:20:54.780+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you so much, and hell yeah I wanna rep it!
