I lost many kills and many GAMES because of that bug.\nI know that karthus is not a very popular champ, but think about the player like me who does main him. \n\nThis bug is present SINCE HIS REWORK and happends EVERY F*KING TIME you proc his passiv, it's not like a bug who happends 1games / 1000, no no it happends EVERY TIME you die in EVERY game you make.\n\nI already made on a post on a french forum 3 month ago, but apprently no one care and I bet if it was a bug like this on a popular champ like LB / Fizz it would be solved in less than a week.\n\nSo plz, solve it.","replies":[{"poster":"TauNoob1","date":"2015-03-08T19:21:33.251+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":1,"body":"I played him a while a go and thought that was just a weird part of his kit.

First off I'm not a Karthus main, but as far as I can tell the lock up occurs when you try to (Q) before Karthus fully transitions into his passive. I've been looking into this today and this is the only way I've been able to reproduce the bug. I'm sending the bug to the champion team who can hopefully find the root cause asap.\n\nAlso talked to a champion update Bro and as far as he knows this is not intended. (Sorry Karthus players {{item:3070}} )\n\n\nNot top comment anymore: Derp.

Honestly, I can see why you might THINK he's powerful, but the moment you realize how long his R cooldown is and how much MR, Zhonya's, Banshee's, Hexdrinker, and raw health screw him over you'll find out the reason he's a niche pick *at best*.","replies":[{"poster":"Asdeft","date":"2015-03-09T13:39:19.952+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Yoella","date":"2015-03-09T17:37:48.094+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">Dont pay attention to this guy.

Niche picks are.. well, niche. They aren't bad, but they can't always perform efficiently unless in good situations. I was a Veigar main until 5.4. Veigar (pre 5.4) was a niche pick and he was definitely great in those niches. However, when those niches were not available to him he suffered. That doesn't mean he always did poorly, it just means that he didn't do as well as he could've done in another situation.\n\nPlease don't take what someone says and misconstrue it just because you disagree with their opinion. I'm not sure if that was your aim or not, but I feel i should bring it up. \n┬──┬ ノ( ゜-゜ノ)","replies":[]},{"poster":"PalPlays","date":"2015-03-09T20:32:23.784+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Cameron2325,realm=NA,application-id=LqLKtMpN,discussion-id=HnZEPq24,comment-id=000300000000,timestamp=2015-03-09T01:38:26.586+0000)\n>\n> Implying being a nichepick makes a champion bad.\n> \n> If he was bad, he would not have been picked, simple as that. \n> \n> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiY3gUODc0g\n\nNo, that isn't true.
