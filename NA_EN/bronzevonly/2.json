I don't belong in Silv4 obviously as within 2 games I was in my first series ever to get back in Silv3.\r\n-----------------------------------------------\r\n**Game 1**\r\nI was top and chose a Teemo into a Chogath. I know this is a terrible matchup for me and my team was raging pre chat that I didn't just go Ryze but I said \"I don't know Ryze well and I have played Teemo quite a bit. (My mains Yi and Annie were either taken or banned)\r\n\r\nI went 5/0/2 vs Cho and they surrendered.\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------\r\n**Game 2**\r\nI had first pick (yay) and chose Annie mid. Their first pick was Yasuo (wtf?) which made me nearly wet myself because I have never lost to a Yasuo as Annie.\r\n\r\n4/0/3\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nMy point? First series ever and I went flawless both games. Really pumped!","replies":[{"poster":"MugyvrNinja","date":"2015-06-25T13:56:06.038+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Welcome to the cesspool that is ranked enjoy your games and play your best :) and never surrender @_@ even if it looks like you are losing\nI think I will let them suffer for a wile.{{champion:9}}","replies":[{"poster":"BronzeVOnly","date":"2015-06-25T21:27:12.136+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MugyvrNinja,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=AY9tFlJV,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-06-25T13:56:06.038+0000)\n>\n> Welcome to the cesspool that is ranked enjoy your games and play your best :) and never surrender @_@ even if it looks like you are losing\n> I think I will let them suffer for a wile.{{champion:9}}\n\nHa thanks!\n\nYeah so far I always vote \"no\" on surrender though some times it kinda pisses my team off.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DingleNutsMcGee","date":"2015-06-25T16:26:43.188+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"going up  by division isnt that hard to do....but wait until youre trying to move up a whole tier (like from S1 to G5). then it gets a little more interesting and a lot more difficult","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lexilulu","date":"2015-06-25T15:56:03.419+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"wait til you get to your s5 quilifiers","replies":[]}]}
