Not orders of magnitude, but legit powers. \n\nHP does not counter damage in any way shape nor form.

This makes the damage formula a fifth power, or 'quintic' function)\n\nHe then notes that this is different from orders of magnitude, but is in fact a difference in the powers of the respective damage and resistance formulas.  The formula for resistance to true damage is literally just 1.0(HP), or a 1st power function of X where X is their total hp.  This is also known more simply as a linear function.\n\nHe also contrasts this linear function for resistances to true damage to the resistance formula for physical/magic damage wherein you only take 100/(100+armor)[incoming physical damage] or conversely where your pEHP can be depicted as hp(1 + armor/100).  Since this is effectively 1.0 hp + 1% hp per 1 point of armor, its a quadratic formula with respect to hp.\n\nAre there any other words or parts of his comment that don't make sense?
