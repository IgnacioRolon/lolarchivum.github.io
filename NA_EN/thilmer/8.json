If your carries go 0-5 then you're screwed because tanks can't solo carry. That is why top laners don't like tanks because your entire impact on the game is dependent on your carries being healthy when you group up with them.

You are talking to someone who plays nothing but top lane to climb whenever I lose too much elo from fooling around. Earlier this season, I won 16 Maokai games in a row when Maokai wasn't even a favorable pick. That was BEFORE the bruiser and fighter meta of course. \n\nThat said, you skipped the point I made in the very first post. When you are counter picked in the top lane as a fighter/bruiser, you have no say at all over the game. You are entirely dependent on your team winning 4v4 and 4v5 (When the enemy top laner shoves you in and roams) which throws your \"carry potential\" out of the window. You have absolutely nothing in your kit that allows you to play from a major deficit. \n\nI see you playing Darius, Yorick, and Garen. These are all champions who can't do shit when they are counter picked or playing from behind. Granted, Yorick can play just about any matchup so I will grant you that at least. However, Yorick is still also heavily reliant on the team to not fight and hold turrets while you split. Which is asking a whole lot in low elos. He is as vulnerable as playing a tank with carries that don't follow up. Just in a different way.

You are talking to someone who plays nothing but top lane to climb whenever I lose too much elo from fooling around. Earlier this season, I won 16 Maokai games in a row when Maokai wasn&#x27;t even a favorable pick. That was BEFORE the bruiser and fighter meta of course. \n> \n> That said, you skipped the point I made in the very first post. When you are counter picked in the top lane as a fighter/bruiser, you have no say at all over the game. You are entirely dependent on your team winning 4v4 and 4v5 (When the enemy top laner shoves you in and roams) which throws your &quot;carry potential&quot; out of the window. You have absolutely nothing in your kit that allows you to play from a major deficit. \n> \n> I see you playing Darius, Yorick, and Garen. These are all champions who can&#x27;t do shit when they are counter picked or playing from behind. Granted, Yorick can play just about any matchup so I will grant you that at least.

I've already been considering playing more {{champion:54}} since champions like {{champion:23}} are strong right because the he is right now he can just out trade other top laners.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"TyroneWatermelon","date":"2018-07-22T20:42:13.335+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":6,"body":"That teleport nerf was a collective punishment because of (guess)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBot lane, the usual asshole kid","replies":[]},{"poster":"SpecterVonBaren","date":"2018-07-23T11:11:04.442+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"You can't destroy something that was already broken.","replies":[]}]}
