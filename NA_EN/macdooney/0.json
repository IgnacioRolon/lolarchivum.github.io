Has no bearing on ER damage, and many people- including Froggen- don't take wall until 8 most of the time, so my numbers are equally valid. That would reduce your ERQ by like... ~25.

I am simply telling you a fact. With this build, only tear (and doran's if you count that, which no one does), level 7-9, anivia LITERALLY does 30-50% with ER and 60-80% with ERQ.

It would have the same impact as if her ult charged up over a 50 second interval.\n\nRito, please revert Anivia's Ult and we will call it even. This is the dumbest idea for any champ where you REDUCE THE RADIUS OF ONE OF THEIR MOVES.\nLook at Zigg's Q, it is now nowhere near as good as how it was before. It misses much more and caused the champ to decline in wins.\nThe only success this has ever had was with Xerath where his old Ultimate was twice the radius of his current one but the ultimate had its range increased.\nUnless you increase the cast range of ultimate, then Anivia will stay fucked.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Blue Rajah","date":"2016-05-04T17:55:45.696+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Well, it does do more damage once it's grown.

She was however made to zone and straight-up stop people if need be with either her W or Q. And besides, if a person where to open up with a Q stun, plus rylais(spelling), and ult almost immediatly after then your target is going to spend quite a long time in that ult. Throw an E in there and she can still burst pretty well imo.","replies":[{"poster":"Anìvìa","date":"2016-05-05T00:51:07.536+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"rylais on anivia? what? \nhit your stun, already hard to accoplish ( in case they dont have mercurys this is the best outcome) it will stun your enemy for 1.5 seconds. you casted it half a second ahead of the hit ( you would end up with 2 seconds of ult in which your enemy was standing inside) a second remains for him to move out, and even with our wall he will hardly stay longer in your r than 4 seconds, so effectively 1 second of enhanced dmg? niiiiiiicceeeee, not.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"5ive5peed","date":"2016-05-04T23:05:37.162+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Some aspects of the changes just reward mediocrity. [STRICTLY AN OPINION]:\n\nA good Anivia doesn't need a longer stun time or a longer E cast range. Even increasing the projectile speed for the E eliminates play styles that involve casting it first before procing the ult, or following it up right behind a Q. \n\nThe ult was traditionally used to safely harass from a distance post level 6 in lane, because kills were only achievable on her own by the enemy either getting poked down by R-E/E-R combos or falling prey to getting hard CC'ed by a Q, after which the full combo was unleashed and lethal.  At level 6, almost every common mid, reworked or not, has an ultimate that directly assists in the burst/nuke of the enemy laner down to death. \n\nAnivia's ult served as a tool to ACTIVELY trade with mid laners who could best her at close range with their CC. It also provided CONTROL by means of creating a zone where MS and AS are both inhibited. YES, I agree the damage amounts for the E with the ult/Q proc are large, but at the same time it comes at the cost of horrendous mana consumption, her lack of mobility, susceptibility to being ganked, as well as the E being entirely dependant on getting that proc for any reasonable damage to be dealt. \n\nIf Riot wants her to be a zone control mage, then why inhibit the core element of her zoning capabilities, yet have a blind eye to huge amounts of burst damage her E gets when proc'ed with ult or Q? TBH a power reduction for how much damage the E does after frost is applied could have been enough to satisfy people wailing about how OP her burst is when she is ahead.\n\nThis rework (NERF) makes Anivia  dependant on landing that Q, which was furthermore dependant on the ult that ZONED them into it or slowed them into getting hit by it. Sure, someone can get close enough to activate the center of the ult onto the enemy laner, but good luck coming out alive because you will be instantly CC'ed/bursted before you can combo anything. \n\nThe ultimate, as it stands now, will rarely see use of the massive MS reduction and 50% damage increase at max size because team fights are so dynamic and mobile. It is now strictly situational to instances where people fight at a turret/dragon/baron, but even then how often do people really sit in that small area when fighting?","replies":[{"poster":"Anìvìa","date":"2016-05-05T01:26:54.538+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"\"A good Anivia doesn't need a longer stun time or a longer E cast range.

It just needs some adjusting on your timing. \n\nI agree with the ulti assisting in the kill.\n\nEven more so with your explanation about her strengths as much as her weaknesses. \n\nI disagree with an e nerv helping in others having no/less problems with her. Even more as I dont see any of those nervs justified. It is hard to play your r e and is always at risk of being ganked. Others have equal damage compared to number of spells being used, and so with greater range/ more savety. \n\nI would have loved to see balances that would match other champions with the strong tank/assasin champions that are way too strong right now. ANd so the nerv on anivia would have been obsolete.( I do not consider her too weak or too strong. I simply believe that she was quite in between. Having hard matchups and less challenging ones that still were not easy to win. ) \n\noverall her changes feel ( and probably are) like a nerv as there was always a way to counter her or prevent her plays by trading better. They made it even easier to do so for no apparent reason( they said so themself, talking about secretly op, \" we see she is not played nor is her rating high, but we think she is too powerfull so we nerv her\" ) \n\nHer ult sure is designed for a different game. In the older days of lol this might have been considered a buff. But as it is i agree with you. No way anyone is going to stand in that ult or hasent stopped you casting it for this increased dmg to be ever useful.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Only Play Darius","date":"2016-05-04T19:26:22.811+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"I liked the juggernaut and ADC class updates, but the mage update feels half-baked. {{champion:8}} lost spellvamp and now has a weird Rumble style heat management on his Q, {{champion:161}} got the true damage band-aid ({{champion:86}}), {{champion:112}} {{champion:34}} seem more clunky now, I don't know.
