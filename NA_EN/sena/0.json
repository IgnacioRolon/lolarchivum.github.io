The video continued to play throughout loading and still kept going once the game had started. The only way to get this to stop was to completely shutdown the client and reload into the game. You obviously don't get to see the video, just the audio portion keeps going.\n\nAs you can imagine, this is rather annoying when you&#039;re in a game to get all that background noise. If you didn&#039;t stop or pause the video before you got into champ select, you would be forced to quit and reload. It&#039;s not a huge thing but definitely irritating.\n\nThanks.","replies":[{"poster":"zerocontext","date":"2015-08-14T22:28:16.750+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for letting us know about this issue!  I'd like to get a little more info if I could...\n\nWas this on the normal client and NOT the PBE client?  I'm asking because we recently rolled out some changes to PBE that included a bug that resulted in videos continuing to play even when games began.  :-(   We're working to fix that and should have it repaired very shortly.\n\nAlso, if this is NOT on pbe, has it happened again since then?  Thanks for helping us track this bug down.\n\nAAAAAND QUICK EDIT: The fix is now out on PBE, so if you are still having this issue (on any environment) please let me know. Thanks!","replies":[]}]}
