But as of recently my computer has been having problems, which, the most recent incident, was after the game started up (just after the champs were locked in in teambuilder) a dialogue appears saying \"cant connect to server, firewall may be screwing it up\" (not exactly that but you get the point) and this hasn't happened to me any time before. And now today when i log in, a leavebuster warning appeared on my screen. And i was having a good record too, honor all the players in the game unless of course they didn't deserve the honor, besides that one game, not leaving any other, and yet here i am, being told to write and typed in agreement to never leave a game again after a bug caused the entire thing to crash no matter how many times i tried to reconnect.\r\n\r\nSo i don't know what to do now, am i forever damned to be a leaver with the stain on my record of the leave-buster agreement...or was it just something that everyone had to sign?","replies":[]}
