But as of late, when i grind like a mad man, getting chests with friends in games and opening them, Plus spending roughly 20$ on it for the sake of chests (Dont buy keys, only buy chests, grind for those fragments)\r\n\r\nI found myself wondering if i had wasted my time, as i got 2 {{champion:53}}  , when i own the champ already, I recived skins for {{champion:99}}  and {{champion:89}}  permanents btw as i re-rolled other skins for them, who of which i dont own at the moment, as well as skins that i bought already with only 1 legacy/ christmas miss fortune to show for it,\r\n\r\nSo my question to the general auidence is, Is this a bug...&gt;.&gt;...&lt;.&lt;...or is it a feature?","replies":[]}
