A way to mute or disable enemy/ally taunts, the ability to spam taunts in games nearly drive me insane and just muting them isnt enough when all they have to do is press one key and suddenly they are spamming their jokes/taunts repeatedly which is pretty much inescapable since if you are near them champion wise, you have to listen to it or when you move your camera away, you die\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Afk in aram wins games, having someone start the game 5 minutes in, buy items that the starting 9 couldnt buy, run in and nuke the place seems a little broken if you ask me, it happens so much that entire games can have their tides turned because all someone has to do is go into the game, buy a gold income item, afk themselves and just wait until they pool enough gold to get an echo, bloodthirster, etc and then just run/ walk into the lane with their team and dominate, i wish there was a system in place that stalls out the gold per minute if you arent engagning the enemy in a certain period of time and since no one can get to the base at the start of the game without dying, afk players have a smaller pool of gold to work with once they finally join into the game\r\n\r\nSure, internet issues and other connectivity issues can occur, but i hate games where one team is pushing because of their one champ advantage to suddenly get aced because the one afk enemy came back carrying a better item than those fighting who haven&#039;t died and just runs the entire lane down\r\n\r\nAn entire 5 minute long stalemate, gone and aced within a moment because that champion has better items than those who are limited to effectively, boots, one ad or ap item and maybe some health pots\r\n\r\n3. Better ways for free players to get skins, sure the chest idea is nice but when the ranking system is based on all other players performance with the champion instead of a simple K/d system (or other system) its quite diffciult for players to get anything besides keys\r\n\r\nAn idea is ip for chest fragments, you need (5,10,15) to get one chest, that way a player can play the game, get ip, spend it for fragments and get rewarded, and since the chest system is random, people will still gamble their money for the chance of a skin/champ they dont have, because as we all have seen, you can spend $300 and get mostly things you already own or just unlocked through the system.\r\n\r\nAnyone have anything to add, post below\r\n\r\n{{champion:202}} \r\n&quot;Art requires a certain...cruelty.&quot;","replies":[]}
