If people are being toxic to you, take the high road. Ignore and mute them. Just play the game. If it's going poorly, take the game as an opportunity to practice mechanics and practice assessing situations rather than playing to win.\n\nWhen you have a cooperative team, that anger doesn't come out. Sure you may get frustrated when you make a mistake, but EVERYONE makes mistakes. Even the best pro players die. Even the best pro players miss farm. Even the best pro players get their jungle stolen. \n\nAlso, play with friends and have fun. I have SO much more fun in SR with friends than I do with 4 randoms.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Telephone Booth","date":"2017-01-04T00:41:32.990+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Drop the ego. You're not special. People make mistakes and so do you, so don't berate them when they do. It's just a game. Live by the golden rule. Mute people. Understand you'll always lose around 50% of your games. If people are dumb on your team, keep in mind the enemy will have dumb players on their team and it's just your turn to have em. Its not worth losing your account to basically sound like one of the other millions of assholes who play any game. You arent making any impact by telling people they suck or whatever. But most importantly... remember it's just a video game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2017-01-03T23:02:44.400+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've heard of people removing their enter key when they're playing too.
