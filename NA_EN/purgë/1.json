I mean HotS has a character who literally gets her full health as a shield and it lasts longer than Janna's, and people shut her down. Janna's pretty easy to lane against if you pick your opportunities. You just can't rubberneck and hope to walk through the lane against her.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Colton147","date":"2018-03-27T02:07:58.760+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{champion:40}} and {{champion:117}} are mechanically intensive and have high skill ceilings.
