They are either Oppressive or Unfun to play as/against them that has little to no counterplay against them\r\n3. My personal opinion on this one, I really hate them with a passion that I question why they are still in that current state right now.\r\n\r\nAnd something that really is bothered me is that 2 of them got a skin that are completely not deserving of a skin *cough*chemtech {{champion:23}}  *cough* Dragonslayer {{champion:5}} .\r\n\r\nStill its kinda of a personal gripe of mine at that point. \r\n\r\nIf they give them a full update, Ill be sure to judge them fairly when it happens. \r\nAs for now, I&#039;m still going to complain on saying &quot;Why haven&#039;t they already reworked &#039;{{champion:80}} {{champion:5}}  {{champion:23}}&#039;&quot;\r\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}}","replies":[{"poster":"reaperteaser","date":"2017-06-24T09:57:01.689+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"i would like to see a dual update with kayle and morg, they kinda both need one","replies":[]},{"poster":"ZapMyHeart","date":"2017-06-24T08:51:31.068+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:23}} probably should be up after just because his gameplay is rather binary.","replies":[{"poster":"CrabPeopleReform","date":"2017-06-24T08:58:56.274+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"he doesn't need it before other other champions like pantheon volibear","replies":[]}]}]}
