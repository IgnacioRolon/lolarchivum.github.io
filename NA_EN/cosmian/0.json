There are times where your ISP gives you an efficient path to our servers, then there are other times where your ISP gives you a less optimal path, causing further issues.  The best step I can recommend is to use our [Connection Analyzer Tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743).  It should give you a health report of your connection and what steps you can take to hopefully resolve it.\n\nI hope this helps!  Give me a heads up if you have any other questions!","replies":[{"poster":"Cosmian","date":"2016-06-02T12:36:39.522+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And if I am  gonna call my ISP what exactly am I going to tell them ?
