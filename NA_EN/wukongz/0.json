NA has higher Rioteer activity than EU(EUW and EUNE boards are merged into one) for whatever reason; hoping they at least notice this here.\n\nIIRC they're planning on removing it from all servers in the future, so getting EUW and NA's support before that happens would be great.\n\nIt took them one year to give us back solo/duo and I\"m hoping it doesn't take 1 year before they return Normal Draft.","replies":[]}]}]}
