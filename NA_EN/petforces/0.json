And instead of removing one of the band members like I have seen suggested I propose that we get an ADC that is either a Rhythm Guitarist or a back up singer. So that you could have all spots on the team filled (Karthus mid) (Sona Support) (Olaf Jungle) and (Mord/Yoric top) But who would best suit that for an adc? You could have Back up singer kogmaw because that would be funny, since he spews so much out of his mouth anyway. Or Draven because hes so popular. He could be there Manager Like a hype man he would be great at that. What do you guys think?","replies":[{"poster":"Inquizelus","date":"2014-11-01T21:11:57.294+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's already five members.
