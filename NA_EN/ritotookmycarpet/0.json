I created a new account and ask player support to get unbanned, because I don't own WoW and it has to be a mistake. I only bought Starcraft and I am forced to have a Battlenet account to play SIngleplayer. I received an instruction to reset my password in WoW and my ticket was closed. I reopened it and said \"I don't own WoW, please read my ticket\". The next supporter banned my account, because it's not allowed to have multiple accounts.","replies":[{"poster":"Bob the Toastr","date":"2018-07-04T05:10:54.051+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Totally agree on Starcraft.
