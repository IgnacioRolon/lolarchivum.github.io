Bounties are also known to be placed on notorious individuals' heads. This applies heavily in League, an enemy champion who is usually fed received a bounty, encouraging your team to trade resources to kill this person. Often ignoring others to get this bounty, bounties also pinpoint high target individuals who must be eliminated.\r\n\r\nA 10/1 champion is someone who is a threat.\r\nA champion who has a lot of CS should not be considered a threat. **Especially in Low Elo**\r\nWe've all had games where either our team or ourselves have been behind or feeding. Whether it's because of that Fiora who \"dumpstered\" our lane and we're sitting 0/4. And with the advice of most teams, it's usually, \"Play safe under tower/avoid fighting\"..or...**farm**. You think to yourself, this is a good idea, Fiora won't get any more fed off of you, you'll just farm. Some time goes by, you're not dying as much but, however, you notice something when you press tab. It's a  bounty for 300-500 gold. (Somewhere in between there). The game has now identified you as a high priority target, remember that 4/0 Fiora we fed? She's even more eager to go for you, the 0/4 laner who does no damage, however, has additional gold, while Fiora has all the means to kill you with ease and gain even more gold for your death.\r\n\r\nThe problem\r\nRewarding bounties for having a good amount of farm is not healthy, more so in low elo. Before this, players who fed outrageously were often left alone as one) they did no damage two) were no real threat and three) offered no real gold for the resources used. However, with the new bounty system, no matter how useless one is in the game, they can still be pursued by the enemy team and be rewarded with an easy kill and vast amounts of gold. \r\n\r\nWhere does this leave individuals who fed, do they farm? Do they not farm? Do they farm and somehow try not to die after being behind for so long?\r\nWho exactly is being rewarded for farming when behind? The enemy team.  Bounties **were a way for your team to \"catch back up\" to the enemy team** or the enemy laner who was fed by offering a vast amount of gold. Now it seems bounties are another way for the enemy team to remain even further ahead. What brought on this post?\r\n\r\nI was a Jax vs Fiora, and won't get into what my jungler and I did to her but let's say I was out of the game. Eventually, I was left alone and farmed top lane..finally completing my** first item** to Fiora's third. Eventually, I got a bounty. And within minutes, that bounty was gone, it didn't go to Fiora but to a Lux who came top with Fiora. Needless to say, despite having a bounty, I was no real threat to the enemy team, I was a mere child to them, however I was still an objective that put them even further ahead.\r\n\r\nThis reduces the chance of counterplay when the enemy team keeps climbing the ladder, I propose bounty for CS be completely removed.","replies":[{"poster":"Attysu The Poro","date":"2019-01-07T20:35:16.283+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your post has been approved! ^^","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cait Main","date":"2019-01-09T18:08:59.869+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"To be real, bounties have hardly changed anything in low elo for csing. If your champion has a 30 cs lead average on the enemy team and your team is ahead, then there is someone on the enemy team you are stonger than who you can kill despite being 0/4. \n\nAlso Kda isn't a factor of how strong a champ is, items and levels are what makes a champ strong so having high cs means you have your core items in most cases. Not to mention that before the cs bounty thing farming still increased the value of killing you but only back up to 300g.\n\nYou could easily argue that getting a bounty for being 3/10 if you just got those last 3 kills recently as also denying comeback potential and you can get that bounty even if your team is behind. The csing bounty isn't really making any low elo games unwinnable. If you have a bounty for farming then someone on your team has to be doing well.","replies":[{"poster":"AFilthyCaitMain","date":"2019-01-12T02:21:53.360+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cs bounties can be highly annoying though, especially if you manage to force someone out of lane early.

The aspect is doing more good than harm, here's why:\n\nA lot of supports in low elo tend to disregard jungler proximity and mid lane roams while at the same time are either wildly aggressive or unreasonably timid. Either way their gameplay has a pivotal effect on how the adc farms. Aggressive supports either die to leave their adc defenseless or take out an enemy on the way while timid supports can either support the adcs farming habits (heals, shields) or be completely regardless and offer no help. When there is the middle ground, the adc can see an entire lane going the way of whoever has picked up the most farm. Given this farm-to-6 jungle meta that ensues, we see a lot of bot lanes having no tough decision of whether to shove lane in and get turret plate gold versus slowly farming and not risking jungler snowballing effects. \n\nThe added risk of playing a safe, shove-in lane for the extra turret gold is now counterbalanced by the pressure of a level 6 jungle gank on a cs-fed carry. Without  this aspect of the game we could see a lot of shove-in bot lane comps on red side gaining free vision control and dragon control just by clearing a wave, poking the turret, then retreating for safety. Basically, what this change does is create more tension around the dragon pit and encourages these level 6 jungle scuffles rather than something like a nocturne camping topside while caitlyn and leona wreck bottom side turret for free gp.
