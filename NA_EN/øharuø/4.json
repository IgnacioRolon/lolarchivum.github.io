Olaf continously bought boots and just ran into people whether tower diving at level 3-4 or just running around them. He kept spamming his twitch link in chat and as soon as the game was over Olaf had 4 Lucidity boots and a good 15 deaths or so.\r\n\r\nEnd game lobby he spams his twitch link and his Twitch title is Intentionally Feed if Disrespected.\r\n\r\nI was demoted.\r\n\r\nWhat is life.","replies":[{"poster":"Paroe","date":"2017-03-16T02:07:03.414+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"If it was recorded open a support ticket for play behaviour with a stream link and video proof. \nFor extreme cases like this, opening a support ticket literally gets them banned within a few days.","replies":[{"poster":"Dark Nephthys","date":"2017-03-16T02:41:22.062+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Paroe,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=x723NEK9,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-03-16T02:07:03.414+0000)\n>\n> If it was recorded open a support ticket for play behaviour with a stream link and video proof. \n> For extreme cases like this, opening a support ticket literally gets them banned within a few days.\n\nEven if he didn't record the game, I think the replay system on the new client might be enough to catch for intentional feed.

No matter of smart plays or defensive strategies. We were being 1 vs 5 by the Vayne at 10-15 minutes. So imagine if we have trouble with 1 person imagine if their whole team fought us , Jinx who's underfed and shit in early, Maoki who's just a support, a viktor and a teemo.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Maddmazz","date":"2017-03-16T02:31:38.102+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I would report and open a support ticket.
