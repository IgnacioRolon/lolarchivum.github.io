(He needs other buffs, I think, but this one aspect is right.)  Zed would be much less oppressive if he had to land either 2 Q's or 2 E's (one from himself and one from his shadow) in order to get energy back to do the other.  This rewards skillful use of the skillshots, and allows counterplay in that dodging stops him from just continuing anyway.

The Nerf cycle has to stop and the Buff cycle has to start. Buff tanky jungler's stats that allows them to jungle early game and Jarvan won't be an issue.\n\nI think after they hit Lee with the nerfbat THEN start the buff-cycle, since the 2 other top teirs knocking Lee out of the running for now are Reksai which is a strong duelist and less Utility and J4 who really only got up a tier because of Gnarvin, 2 powerful jungles with very clear weaknesses (Reksai has poor utility and her ult is only good for positioning, J4, well, your post)","replies":[{"poster":"futuresight23","date":"2015-01-25T23:30:41.182+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Tik115,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=bnuOHmqG,comment-id=000d0000,timestamp=2015-01-25T22:04:42.903+0000)\n>\n> I think after they hit Lee with the nerfbat THEN start the buff-cycle, since the 2 other top teirs knocking Lee out of the running for now are Reksai which is a strong duelist and less Utility and J4 who really only got up a tier because of Gnarvin, 2 powerful jungles with very clear weaknesses (Reksai has poor utility and her ult is only good for positioning, J4, well, your post)\n\nYes Gnar and Jarvan have strong synergy, but Jarvan is a top jungler even without Gnar.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"qetzel","date":"2015-01-25T22:27:02.868+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"To be fair, they just buffed four of the junglers you mentioned, Sion is strong in the top lane and a buff will push him over the edge and Amumu has a consistent win rate.You could make an argument for Cho'Gath being sleeper OP.","replies":[{"poster":"Nicarasu","date":"2015-01-25T23:28:15.286+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think you're right about cho.

He feels really balanced IMO.\n\nHe can't just instantly delete people like Lee Sin, he has to have great timing with his Q and E to even be mobile an his ultimate is basically a really crappy snare. \n\nIf they were to nerf anything about him that I can say makes sense is his ults damage.  There have been many times where a target has almost escaped me and i just say \"fuck it.\" and ult them for 20% of their health. \n\nBut after the fear of him being nerfed after the first couple of months of playing him, i realized that they wouldn't nerf him because well everyone else was far weaker then him.

Just ram your ult down mid and get free kills.  J4 can ult the mid laner 3 times (rank 2 ult+) after he blows their flash, before it comes up again.\n\nIf \"bad plays\" means only having flash open every 5 minutes then yeah they got \"outplayed\" by me pressing R.\n\nAs if they even need to be in an aggressive positiong when your E+Q+R takes you across the entire lane.\n\nJ4 is going to fuck immobile picks ALWAYS because of his ult, but there's no reason he should do that plus deal ridiculous damage and having insane mobility, all the while being tanky.  Riot said they don't want hard counters but J4 HARD counters immobility, in a time where just being mobility creep is very pronounced anyway.  Literally 0 incentive to pick an immobile champ, which edges out a huge amount of the roster.","replies":[{"poster":"VDc0zCqe0w","date":"2015-01-27T21:12:05.536+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"VI is equally ultra retarded in that aspect\n\nQ from 19 kilometers, R, gg kill midlane\n\nif you ain't got flash or a champ with dash you can't do anything","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Alpharite","date":"2015-01-26T21:06:47.991+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Jarvan's OP now?

Instead, I liked laughing like a maniac while I trapped the enemy team in my ult and watch as they can only focus me because the melees provided the CC and the ranged attacked from afar.
