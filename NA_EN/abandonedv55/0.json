(DESPERATE)","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, I got hacked a few years ago.. I think 2? Or so.. And like, I was traumatized by the event, because this hacking happened in real life.. It brings back real haunting memories. If I shall share, it brings the memories of a tragic event... This username that I have now, is very very disturbing to me, and to have to use it as my username for the rest of my life, will always affect my in-game mentality.. I am unable to play at my best, all because I have to sign in everyday, type the same username, and be reminded of the dark incident that happened to me at the time.. All I'm asking is for a username change, or to allow a 1-time username change.. Not the in-game name, I mean my account, for Log-in.. I asked Riot Support, but they are apparently 'unable' to do so 'at the moment', when we all know, that they are well capable of a 'username change' option.. They are so capable and I don't know why they won't do it.. They can help so many players in the community to be a better player, and I am one of those distressed individuals.. Please, please, I am desperate for a username change, please allow a ONE TIME username change.. If you want, you can make a profit, for changing usernames after the free change has been done.. Please, please Riot, read this and to the community, whoever agrees, please help make this post reach the top so the Riot Team can read it and help those in need such as me.. :/ Please, if I get my username to change, I can live life better, this is a life-and-death situation, as I play League of Legends every day, and this username affects my mentality, even to my everyday life.. Please, hear me out, I'm begging yous.. Please.. Please save my life, and turn my life around. Riot, I know you are capable of a username change, you can easily do so in a minute or two.. Yous are able to make the game and more complicated aspects of it, I know for sure you can easily make a 'username change' option.. Please.. Help me.. Isn't the job of the Riot Support to alleviate any stress a player has due to in-game and/or account issues? Please, Riot. listen to me, this is an amazing option, believe me.. Please, help.. :(","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-07-12T22:10:52.968+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm sorry to hear your username is causing you such troubles. I looked into your ticket with support and can confirm what the agent told you was correct- we cannot change usernames. Because a username is unique to an account and ties directly to login and account management, it's tied to the account for life. A server transfer is the only instance when your username will change, due to the account technically changing to a new type of account in another region. \n\nI truly wish there were more I could do to assist you with this. If you have any further questions, I recommend reaching back out to the support agent in your open ticket.","replies":[{"poster":"Cuetlachtli","date":"2016-07-12T23:19:01.675+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"A server transfer is the only instance when your username will change, due to the account technically changing to a new type of account in another region.\" So you can, just transfer Account to other Region and make it come back\n\nNot trying to be mean just trying to help","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-07-13T15:46:39.676+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I left out a crucial part of information with that.

So does that change my username or will it remain the same, because I know no one has my username, (or the username I want to change to)..

Or will it revert back to my original username in EUW?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"AbandonedV55","date":"2016-07-15T19:04:57.189+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you so much for the kind comments.. I am disappointed in a way, knowing I am not able to change my username, but I'm still not over that 'hope' of one day, you will offer a username change to me.. I will continue to be a great and inspiring player in the community.. I will get to the top, and will change this.. I will still try to ask if you can change my username.. I know yous are capable, and am hoping that one day, you will allow a username change.. I've spent too long in this account, and I don't want to lose the content, I just want to change my log in name.. It means so much to me.. It legit means my life, because League of Legends is my favorite game, and knowing I can't change my username really disappoints me.. I will be waiting for the day, I really still hope you can change it for me.. :/ I will do anything, I promise, it could improve me so much.. Thank you for your support, will always be waiting for this..","replies":[]}]}
