Horrible Bias, Induce Player Anger.","subforum":"Player Behavior","up_votes":4,"down_votes":12,"body":"I Could write and essay about all the flaws, but i don&#039;t have time for it, so i will leave you to debate the ethics of the game and system. \n\n1. Would you rather a toxic player, or an unskilled player. \n2. If someone purposely trolls a game, is that not a valid reason to get angry towards that player.\n\nThis is my remark for both questions. 1. Of course there are games where the overall bad player will do the winning play in the game, but in general, the unskilled player will be the reason of your loss. Balance of probability. Even if he is the most positive person, he will lose you the game if he is unskilled. A player who perform great, even if he is toxic, he will most likely carry the game for you. If you are preforming as good, he wont be negative towards you. If you are preforming bad, you just have to suck it up. just filter the negative comments and extract the counsel and advice, or even the reason of your mistakes so you can improve.---You will win more games with toxic/pro than positive/noob.\n2. Obviously, any logical person will approve of the validity of the anger. Its likely that your anger may affect the other none-troll players, but the game is already lost because of the trolls actions.--- On another argument, if someone ruins your painting, or any piece of work of yours. You would have reason to be angry, and wish to inflict misfortune upon the that person. Same scenario apply to league games. if a troll ruins your perfect game on purpose, you should have the right to be enraged. Unfortunately, the end result is the ruined_game_angry_player will be reported and banned, and not the troll.   \n\nSide not. irrelevant to topic. I had a clean record on activity in game (I was never afk.) for a good 50 games. yet i disconnect for 7min during a rank game. i reconnect and play until the end. And i receive low priority queue 20min for 5 games. Ridiculous punishment.","replies":[{"poster":"AeroWaffle","date":"2016-09-24T16:37:47.869+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"1) Being bad at the game and being uncivil are not mutually exclusive. They are separate. Being bad at the game is excusable not only because being bad at a videogame is not a punishable offence, but also because it's not something that the player has complete control over 100% of the time. Your reaction speed, game knowledge, and tactics are being matched against your opponent. You will only \"suck\" relative to who you're playing against.\n\nGoing out of your way to piss someone off is completely in your control the entire time.\n\n2) You're always free to be angry, it's not expected that you control your emotions. Only your _**actions**_.\n\nIn your analogy, should you act on your desire to inflict misfortune on the person that made you angry, you can still be held responsible for your actions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TrulyBland","date":"2016-09-24T16:27:44.656+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"1. If we're looking at extremes, I prefer the unskilled player. Doesn't matter if I'm more likely to win. I'm not a professional LoL-player, and as such I actually play this game for fun.

Doesn't solve the problem, is in fact more likely to make the problem worse and makes the atmosphere of the game even more toxic.\nAll of your arguments are based on the validity of the emotion, but nobody is arguing that you shouldn't be angry.

I'm not gonna deny that, but what is the point of taking the time to start looking like a jackass in-game? You're just giving them satisfaction. I don't really agree with Riot completely ignoring context of a situation, but on the other hand they are pretty damn lenient.

Why am I banned???\na) I'll keep this one simple: retaliation isn't OK. Reacting to a toxic player by being toxic just incites that player to be even worse--it also ruins the game for up to 8 other players. It is far, far worse to watch two people yelling at each other all game than it is to watch 1 player ranting into blank space. Almost everyone in the game can find someone out there that behaves worse than they do--but so what? Finding someone worse doesn't justify your behavior or justify retaliation. We expect more out of our players. What players often don't realize is... those other players in your game that you thought were worse? Nearly 100% of the time, those players were banned even before you were. If someone is being toxic, just report them and move on. If you retaliate, both of you will be banned. It's really that simple.\n\n______________\n\n> If someone was to verbally abuse you, would you stand there and take it? You can&#x27;t walk away like you can in real life and you are stuck with the person. You also know blocking fixes nothing in the end. Another person will have to sit through the torture.\n\nYes you are stuck with the person until the end of the game (where you can then report them for their poor behavior), but by muting them you ensure that you aren't tempted to rage back at them like they want you to. If the other person would rather not mute them and listen to the ragers rage then that's on them not Riot.\n\n> Common sense also says that a toxic player that is really good can carry the team. Some people in diamond are so unethical that I wonder how they don&#x27;t piss people off. Denying that toxic people can get to diamond is the same as saying that rude bosses don&#x27;t exist. It&#x27;s complete nonsense.\n\nYes they can get to diamond, but chances are that they will be punished soon enough for their poor behavior if they haven't already (assuming that people valid report them for it of course).\n \n> Would a company suggest a person&#x27;s feelings are not valid? I would sure as hell hope not or they will lose a customer. If someone goes into a public sphere and plays loud music, and then someone gets angry at them and tells the to get the heck out, who is the one who get&#x27;s in trouble socially? It&#x27;s the loud person. That isn&#x27;t how it is here. \n\nDepends on the circumstances. If the loud music player is doing so at a special event where loud music is generally needed then they won't get in trouble, but otherwise they would. As for the shouter, obviously they would get in trouble for repeatedly harassing the loud music player about it instead of just walking away from it entirely and voluntarily and reporting it to the proper authorities so that they could deal with it themselves.\n \n> Don&#x27;t expect people to be nice to people acting disrespectfully. It&#x27;s the same as asking for respect while disrespecting people. Chances are, you won&#x27;t be respected nor treated well.\n\nNow this I can agree with. It's just like the Golden Rule states: \"Treat others the way that you want to be treated\". Treat people like a jerk then expect to get treated like a jerk yourself by them. Treat others with respect then expect to get treated with respect yourself by them.","replies":[]}]}]}
