Well i have been talking with riot to try and fix the issue i was having on the NA server. however i know there are some of you that are having these issues on other servers and you cannot figure out why even though this may of started to just happen right as the 7.20 Patch went live.\r\n\r\nThrew the week and a half of talk with those at riot and my own ISP, which i even had a technicial come to the house and check the lines and change out the modem which did not work either. i had a thought about a half hour ago, why dont i try to rollback  my Network adapters as a last option i didn't even think about until the game i was in at the time.\r\n\r\nWell i only had one adapter that could be rolled back,(qualcomm atheros ar8161 pci-e gigabit ethernet controller (ndis 6.30)), which i did roll it back and wow did it work for me but that doesnt mean its a fix more like a temporary fix until they find the culprit in the patch,(which i assume there is one), that would cause your latest driver update for your network adapter to become less efficient and cause higher pings without any packet loss.\r\n\r\nThose having the problem like i did should go ahead and try this as a temporary solution, and yes i did notify them on the temporary fix i found for it until they are able to fix it.","replies":[{"poster":"Dreamstime","date":"2017-10-20T14:31:47.499+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah it’s been happening to me too, every single game my ping will go from a steady 37 and randomly jump to 150+, super annoying since I can’t even predict when it’ll happen.
