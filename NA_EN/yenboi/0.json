So you can keep talking all you want all it does is makes you an hypocrite. I don't care if you downvote me. I don't care if i say something unpopular. I will voice my opinions and i will call on people's garbage when needed. He got banned for refusing to communicate, for creating a hostile enviorment in every single game he had. He completely ignored when a rioter even told him to stop doing what he was doing due to the environment he was creating. Sorry but he got the rightful ban he deserved if you have an issue with that i could care less. I am not using my \"personal interpretations\" i read the facts and i am telling you what they are, you have a problem with that? bring it up to Riot and everyone else involved including the dude who got banned","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-02-08T00:03:12.402+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I believe you are flaming the wrong person.","replies":[{"poster":"ZephyrDrake","date":"2017-02-08T04:23:55.245+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MagicFlyingLlama,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=jRnuOqVN,comment-id=000400000000000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2017-02-08T00:03:12.402+0000)\n>\n> I believe you are flaming the wrong person.\n\nToo bad, because i believe i am flaming the right person.
