In the gif I show myself mashing the button, and at the end I click it once without the mashing, both to the same effect. It's getting a little annoying as I've had this bug for a day or two (so restarting client/computer doesn't fix it), any solutions would really help me out :).","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-17T21:47:38.235+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I noticed that pretty shortly after the patch myself! It kinda sucks not being able to set yourself as away right now, but the devs are aware and are planning on getting that fixed up relatively soon!","replies":[{"poster":"Zetres","date":"2017-08-18T19:33:54.608+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Awesome, thanks for the response!","replies":[]}]}]}
