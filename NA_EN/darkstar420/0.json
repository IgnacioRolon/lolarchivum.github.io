What you're describing are really common symptoms seen from *Packet Loss* issues. We may have to eventually look at your network routing to find the culprit, but I'd first like you to work through our [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) so we can confirm your local network settings are in good standing.\n\nLet me know if this helped.","replies":[{"poster":"Robot Salad","date":"2017-10-25T04:00:02.190+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He made a post because he didn't want to read through the entire connection guide to find out which ports to forward or what firewalls are causing the interruption or whatever the actual issue is. I know because I'm experiencing the same thing and don't want to read the entire connection guide. I think it's a Windows 10 problem but I feel better blaming Riot because they have less money.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"TrynHard","date":"2017-05-24T22:35:08.305+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd like to say this happened to me as well. Had good connection and very high fps and the game would skip around like I had packet loss. This was very annoying. The thing that finally fixed it was upgrading windows 10. I was using home edition and upgraded to education edition I got from my university. Education is basically Enterprise Edition. Not sure what the problem was maybe a bad install or something, but this worked. Hope it helps","replies":[]}]}
