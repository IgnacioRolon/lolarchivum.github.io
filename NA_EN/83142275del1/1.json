That is bs. i can code etc so i get annoyed when a \"new patch\" is out and people i know cannot even play. i literally had 1 good game as teemo ( i don't even play him) aram, yet next game, lux my main, i have to dc and roll back in, only to still lag. GET IT TOGETHER. \r\n\r\nif my internet is fine, and a friend is ethernet connected, it is your patch that is the problem and i suggest you fix it. I have both windows and mac comps, I thought of using my windows computer yet why should I when people with windows are having the same BS?","replies":[{"poster":"83142275DEL1","date":"2017-08-13T00:24:51.696+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i cannot log in now, WTF","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-12T02:39:21.083+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It actually sounds like your connection might be hitting a bit of packet loss after it leaves your network. Packet loss only happens when parts of your connection get lost or corrupted along its route to our servers, so it can be pretty hard to manage since it's already damaged by the time it reaches us. Most of the time it's caused by some kind of improperly working node along the way your ISP routes your connection, so let's take a quick look at the health of your connection after it leaves your network. \n\nGrab some of those network logs from a game that had that lag, and let our [**log reader**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743) scan it. Post a screenshot of it here I can go over it with you.","replies":[{"poster":"83142275DEL1","date":"2017-08-12T14:41:44.487+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"how do i grab network logs?
