I have a mac, I've seen windows go thru the same BS. I have also seen windows friends download this game and have a shitty resolution. Ever since the last 3 patch updates. \n\nI lost then won a 2nd game, only because i was able to play safe in spikes i am used to. Trouble is, I never had ping spikes before this past month and I am really getting sick of it. I had someone reply last time and said they fixed the patches, yet my updated status has regular ping spikes and I really do not appreciate it. I am trying to improve but I cannot win my lane when fucking 200 or 500 (yes, even up to that for at least 5 seconds which means I may die, lose tower in that time etc) happens during games. My internet works perfectly otherwise. \n","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2017-08-24T22:22:23.042+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Playing with random ping spikes would make anyone rage and want to toss their computer out the window.  I feel ya, and I want to get these resolved asap.  When we are talking about ping spikes, we need to take a step back and look at how they happen:  When you connect to a match of League, your computer needs to establish a connection to our Game Servers, the same server as everyone else in the game.  If your connection spikes, that means that something interrupted that connection between your computer and our servers.  \n\nThe best step we can take right now is to look more in-depth to find out what is causing this.  To that end, use our [Log Reader Tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743).  It'll analyze the last few games, identify any issues with your connection, and give you a few different solutions to solve it. \n\nif none of that stuff seems to help, make sure to reply back and let me know!","replies":[]}]}
