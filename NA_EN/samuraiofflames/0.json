I still remember the game, as it was pretty tilting. So basically, I was in a game with a trio, all 3 of them were queued up together. I believe it was 2 brothers, and an IRL friend. (their friend, not mine.) The older brother, I'm somewhere assuming he is 14-15, was talking mad shit, but of course, chat logs don't show that, they take everything out of context. The younger brother (who was 12) was medically autistic, as the older brother said. (also, I went from bronze 4 to about silver 3-4 in a VERY short time, about a week, so I was pretty cocky, but still, none of my words concerning skill deserved a ban, but anyway, my ban was probably not because of my trash talk *which was because they trash talked me, but hey, its riot, whats context?* Anyway, the part where I was calling them bronzies, and stuff like that, It's a normals game, at the time I thought everyone was just suppose to go like full ad or ap in a normals game, nobody really played normals honestly. Also, about the game context, they were mad at me for playing zac support, in a NORMAL game. I think what got me banned is this \" veigar whats a(n) autistic child like him doing in a online game with many people that are having bad days that go full out toxic \" Which I intended zero harm, and I'm sure any logical person would agree, that sentence was probably made by someone who had a bad day, but still, had no technical harm to it, since he is medically autistic, and I am trying to \"help\" him. Here's the game text. (Mind you, I am black, so the one time I said \"%%%%%\" shouldn't count for a ban either, but again, I don't think that is the case xD)\r\nI am well over this, I just saw TFT blowing up and wanted some nostalgia back to league. (I have had this game for YEARS, since like 2013 or something)\r\nI also just saw a thread about a perma ban, and thought people's opinions about this would really help me understand if it was a logical perm ban or not.\r\nAlso, mind my spelling in the game logs, I was still basically learning English.\r\n\r\nAnd another also, a very big important part of this, THEY WERE A TRIO, obviously I got mass reported, the enemy was with me though, because my teammates were speaking ALL-chat, If i remember correctly.\r\n\r\n(also, I believe this is my first thread, so a moderator, please tell me

This chat log is absolutely unacceptable, and remains unacceptable no matter what the other team was saying to you. The ban is correctly placed.\n\nYeah, that was about 2 years ago, and reading back it at, it was a pretty toxic chat log. Also, I wasn't really going against the other team, like I said it was a trio I was playing with (with, as in my team, not my friends) and so it was basically an all out 1v3 in team chat. The enemy team was actually siding with me, like I also said before. I feel like judging another players skill shouldn't really lead to a ban, all the player could do is mute. I should have done that, a while ago, but that was clearly a mistake on my behalf. I really do feel like riot NEEDS to look in the context of what the whole chat log is about, take a look back at dunkey's ban, he was basically in the same situation as me, his teammates made him absolutely fume, in his case, the teammates were throwing, but mine were just, lets say verbal throwing. (not really a real thing, I know.) and he made a mistake, because of how ticked he was. \n\nJust so everyone knows what's up, I'm not asking for an unban, I am completely over this, just though coming \"back\" to league, i wanted people's opinions on this ban, since I really though riot would maybe care about context, but nothing has changed.\n\nI'm giving absolutely no hate to anyone in the community or anything, I'm just flexing my opinions, and I'd really appreciate it if you guys do as well.\n\nI knew already what the answers would be like, and I'm not even surprised xD.

They could've gotten chat restricted, 14 day banned or perma banned\nAnd honestly, how and if they got punished doesn't really matter either, because we're talking about your punishment \n\nAnd i don't think you can check it any way, the only thing that matters is that you've had a 14 day ban.

Undirected bad language like \"wow, good thing that fucking brush was warded\" is substantively different from insults like calling someone the r-word or using \"autistic\" to criticize their performance.\n\nYou stated: \"I also just saw a thread about a perma ban, and thought people's opinions about this would really help me understand if it was a logical perm ban or not\" which, to me, clearly indicates that you're not quite sure whether your punishment was correct. If you had already resolved that question (either way), there'd be little purpose to seeking out further discussion.\n\nThe \"context\" of what other people said is not taken into account for your punishment because those aren't things you said, and I don't think anyone would like to be punished based on someone else's actions. The only way other people can \"get you banned\" is by tricking you into misbehaving, and you definitely misbehaved.
