Otherwise, it is just reconnecting. Somehow the window focus is inverted.\r\n\r\nStep to reproduce (must only be me):\r\n1. Start a custom or a normal game.\r\n2. Wait for the game to load and start.\r\n3. Unplayable.\r\n\r\nI have tried the following:\r\n1. Reconnecting multiple times including closing the game and launcher.\r\n2. Restarting.\r\n3. Switching monitors and disconnecting a monitor.\r\n4. Switching window mode and resolution.\r\n\r\nPC specs:\r\nBeta launcher client\r\nWindows 10\r\n\r\nThe issue only began last night and happens every time a game starts. I have linked a video showing the issue.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions are welcome!","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-07T00:42:11.872+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Most window focus issues that I've seen in the past have been caused by a background application interfering with League.
