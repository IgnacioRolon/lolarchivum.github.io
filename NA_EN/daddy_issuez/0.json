When someone dashes onto you (maos t advance for example) their character teleports backwards/briefly vanishes before dashing to you.  It is happening when people snowball as well - members of both teams have experienced it (across multiple games) on various heroes.  It messes with timing on your response because it makes the dash seem instantaneous and you often lose vision of them.\n\nLATER EDIT: I've also experienced two games where yas has been ulting people who use thresh lantern.

It's way more game-impacting than you'd think from reading about it.\n\nAlso can confirm that if you go back and watch a replay, the bug doesn't appear and all dashes look normal.
