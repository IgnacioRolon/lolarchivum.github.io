(of course, that&#039;s the reason you&#039;re here) well then surely, wait no, MAYBE you&#039;ve come across an udyr. udyr is, in my opinion, the most broken champion in the game. you thought you were getting away at level 5 with 600 hp from that udyr gank? nope! here he comes from behind your turrets with a stun that lasts god knows how long and a bunch of auto attacks that deal over 200 damage per each one. and thought you were going to easily pick up a kill on him? nope! here he comes again with a broken stun and here he is attacking you so hard that you die before you could even do anything. thought you could get your team grouped up to kill him? nope! he&#039;s gonna flash onto your adc, one shot him, and peacefully run away with his e that gives him 1000 movespeed.\r\n\r\nudyr needs a nerf, a BIG nerf, maybe even a rework, because he&#039;s so broken that i instantly dodge each time i see an udyr, and i&#039;m permabanning him at this point.\r\n(some of this was over exaggerated, but you get the point, udyr is busted as fuck and needs a huge nerf.)\r\n{{sticker:zombie-nunu-bummed}}","replies":[{"poster":"Mountain Warden","date":"2018-06-05T15:36:35.305+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"There's no doubt he's God tier in the jungle. Somehow people have at times forgotten about Udyr despite him always being a great pick. I think it has to do with the fact that he's one of the only champions in the game with zero range abilities which makes people nervous. But I wouldn't call him broken. He's got clear weaknesses in the form of no range. And if he's building damage and blowing you up 1v1, he will loose on the long run since your ADC can return the favor and melt him from a distance. Strength wise, he's where he should be given how much damage and mobility is available in the game at the moment.","replies":[{"poster":"DuskDaUmbreon","date":"2018-06-05T16:38:41.161+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lmao what.

Trust me..I play it and it gets annoying.  Yeah if they blew a long CD and I caught them at the right time with their pants down and they happened to also not have flash up...then yes, its easy to run them down.  But that happens SO infrequently if they are playing smart and warding.  It's not like an Udyr can just pop out of nowhere like a Kayn or Fiddlesticks and blast you.  You have to be mega derp'ing it to not notice Udyr coming.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Gabresol","date":"2018-06-05T16:53:03.832+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He just needs an adjustment.\nThey pumped too much damage into the tiger stance, and the phoenix stance only exist if you want to use nimbus","replies":[]},{"poster":"dunder kill","date":"2018-06-05T15:45:00.285+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Just because you got smashed by an Udyr last game doesnt mean hes the most broken champ in the game.

His Cooldowns need to be lowered.  His only fighting is stance dancing.  And 90% of the game, you only ever use 3 of his 4 skills because you are either maxing Tiger or Phoenix.  So, Udyr is a champ with HIGH mana usage, high CD's (until levels and Trinity Force is bought) and kited easily.  The only lane he IS good in is jung because of blue buff.  If you don't have blue buff, your mana is GONE in about 5 stance switches....and you need to have swapped to three in order to activate Aspect of the Monkey.  Forget about ever having that up in lane without a blue buff.\n\nI agree with you that he might need a rework, but his kit is unique and should stay similar.  He needs buffs imho. Nothing has changed other than items.","replies":[]}]}]}
