Is this something wrong with the new client? It always says \"Cannot connect to masteries server. This could be a connection issue.\" Its obviously not a connection issue since i'm able to stream and do other things. It will not let me change them or even add new pages. Any ideas?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-04T02:43:05.437+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually, because different servers/services reside in different geolocations, this could definitely be a connection issue, more specifically, a routing issue to specifically our servers. These issues are commonly caused by conflicting network settings on your local network, so I advise you to work through our [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to ensure that's not the case!\n\nPlease let me know if this caused any change for you.","replies":[]}]}
