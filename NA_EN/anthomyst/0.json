Could it be because I live in the south?","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I hope this is still an issue for yall, cause its a major issue for me. I am constantly playing around 200-500, The weird thing is, it only happens to me in summoners rift and aram. In twisted tree line i had around 44 ping but as soon as i went into a summoners rift match BOOM 500 ping! I live in Texas could that be a reason why my ping is so high? I have really good internet, and i dont have connection issues with any other game besides League. This issue started to arise after a certain patch. I hope they can fix this issue cause i'm thinking about finding another game.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-19T04:48:59.405+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since patches only change files in your local League directory, they're **very unlikely** to impact your connection to our servers. Changes in latency (ping) are typically caused by either problems in your network routing or in your local network settings. I suggest checking out our [connection guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) for a list of common solutions.\n\nLet me know if you continue to experience high latency after working through those steps.","replies":[]}]}
