After winning the match neither of us got a chest. The last chest I won was yesterday, my client shows that I can till win 2 more. She has not gotten a chest in a while and the Profile-Overview shows that she can still win 3 more.\r\n\r\nDoes it not award one instantly sometimes? Is there a certain period of time we have to wait before it awards us with the chest or was this a bug?\r\n\r\nThanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-24T02:15:44.034+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It looks like you two didn't get chests for that match because you have both already received chests for Garen and Alistar this season.
