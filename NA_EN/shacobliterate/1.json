Now, not gonna lie, I'm kinda new to the whole cosplay scene. As such, I don't really know what I'm doing as far as wigs and props go. I know prosthetics and makeup, so I'm good there, but the wig and the shivs have me lost. If anyone has any sort of expertise on this sort of stuff, it'd help alot. \r\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]}
