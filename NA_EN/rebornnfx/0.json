So now I have a 10 minute wait timer. The stupid part is I don't even deserve this not just from the client itself being stupid, but I have dodged 1 game for a friend, NEVER afked yet I get a 10 minute wait timer, this is honestly absurd, I am being punished for riot's mistakes, how is this fair? I am not just gonna let Riot's spaghetti code ruin my game rep, plus I have spent $150+ on this game, I don't even get priority on fixing bugsplats and stuff? 1 reason why I hate this game.\r\n\r\n(I dodged the game 3 months ago.)","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-28T23:24:09.389+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like your client is disconnecting from the servers, which causes it to crash out.

Paying doesnt give any benefits other than what you bought with the rp.\nThe window bug is known, it has something to do with a windows update and a xbox thing installed on the computer.\nAt least you don't have the mac problem that keeps you from loading the game and forces a leave.","replies":[{"poster":"RebornnFX","date":"2016-09-24T03:49:54.868+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, the dodge was months ago.
