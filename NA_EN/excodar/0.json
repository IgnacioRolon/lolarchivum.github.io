I'm just saying that every player has their own reason why someone is on their permaban list and most of the times, these champions are there because of the popular opinion. This means that players themselves don't understand why they're banning these champions, they merely adapt the ban list from pro play and use it as factual evidence that they are, in their current condition, too strong for the current meta.\n\nIf a champion is being banned in most of the games, then there definitely is a legitimate reason why they're being banned. But if you ask players themselves why do they ban what they ban, most of the times you're either going to get generic response (because they're OP/broken) or they wouldn't know how to properly answer your question.
