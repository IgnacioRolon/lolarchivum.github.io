What more do we need? We have iteration after iteration of champ designs that already have some sort of similarity. We have kits that are mirroring each other. We have variety. But MOST importantly, every time a new champ is released the game&#039;s already awful gameplay balance gets worse because there are 5 other abilities to factor in and not to mention the possible items the champion might use. Just seems like an insult at this point to add more champs. The league universe is being fleshed out really nicely lorewise. Each new champ now has to fit into it and I see this becoming a problem in the future as lore will become subpar. I feel Riot should just take a whole year or 2. No new champs. Reworks are allowed and limited to 2 a year. Focus on balancing the game. ACTUALLY listen to the high elo players instead of depending on Rioters who aren&#039;t as experienced. Maybe if they did, this game would actually improve. This eSports craze will eventually die out and if players don&#039;t have a balanced game to return to, then you know what happens next.","replies":[{"poster":"Krully","date":"2018-06-24T01:03:21.968+0000","up_votes":25,"down_votes":1,"body":"yeh because 147 is uneven number and i dont like it","replies":[{"poster":"Anin777","date":"2018-06-24T01:16:05.765+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly I concur.

In a rush to keep their momentum and in fear of losing their playerbase, Riot pushed out a new champ every two weeks. Hence why you see so many reworks happening: Because RIot pushed out bad designs that added very little to the game and didn't think of the long term repercussions. \n\nAlso new releases are incredibly slow compared to the early days. It'd take us over 10 years to hit 200 so it's fine for Riot to make new ones, so long as they add different play patterns to the game.\n\n>This eSports craze will eventually die out and if players don't have a balanced game to return to, then you know what happens next.\n\nDoTA, CSGO and more have existed for almost two decades.

However, I agree that the game is in dire need of some comprehensive balance work, far more than new champions at this point. Balancing a game with 100+ different kits is difficult enough, but it's even more so now that there are virtually no clear standards for how a match is expected to run, and what levels of damage, crowd control, etc. are considered acceptable. Riot needs to reevaluate League's framework first and dive deep into what needs to be fixed, and I think that in itself could be worth delaying a few releases.\n\nI think part of the problem now is that, while there are undoubtedly a ton more gameplay fantasies to have in League, a lot of very recent releases and reworks have been poorer in quality than what we've expected, and often fairly samey. Ornn had an interesting theme as a blacksmith, but in practice he's yet another CC-loaded tank, for example. Meanwhile, Pyke's character and backstory have the same key elements as Nautilus, a flaw Riot themselves admitted to. Also by Riot's own admission, Aatrox is now being turned into a juggernaut version of Riven. It's this relative dearth of creativity that makes me wish Riot took a step back for a moment to ask themselves what they're doing, and whether they're truly making the best use of each existing champion in their game. Too many champions blend into each other, and it feels like design is often constrained by this need to add the same mechanics in the same way, e.g. with dashes, displacement, percent health/true damage, etc. I'd rather change the game in such a way that it allowed for a greater diversity of playstyles, rather than continue with the production line of champions that have increasingly felt like they've had to follow a predefined mold.","replies":[{"poster":"Anin777","date":"2018-06-24T13:43:47.048+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Awesome write-up man!
