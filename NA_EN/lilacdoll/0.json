Thank you for trying to push it though, great testing! :D\n\nWhen the app comes out of closed beta, that button will go live. We do receive all of the star ratings sent through the feedback page before that though, so please do continue to give ratings there.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Shadow00m","date":"2016-02-11T00:13:40.449+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had the same issue.
