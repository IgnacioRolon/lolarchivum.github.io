I hope you're having a wonderful morning or evening.\r\n\r\nPermanent suspensions are a frequent topic within the LoL community. After receiving three warnings,  you still failed to stop being toxic and flaming (or inting) excessively and were banned.\r\n\r\nNow, just last night, my friend received that ominious pop-up on his client: Your account has been penalized for unsportsmanlike conduct. Please relog to see your ban duration and reform card. We were voice-cjatting on Discord, and he was praying: please let it be a 14-day ban, please.\r\n\r\nAnd alas, it was a permanent ban. He was completely DEVASTATED. His account had been level 205 with over sixty skins. He was so, so, so upset, and while he did flame, it still felt heartbreaking. \r\n\r\nI asked him what he'd do if Riot gave him a second chance. He responded, \"I didn't think I'd actually get permabanned. I'd never talk again.\"\r\n\r\nThat's just my story. I'm sure most of you have a story about getting permabanned. Now, onto my proposals. \r\n\r\ni think we should give permabanned players a chance to appeal their punishment and get to use their account again. HOWEVER, In order to apply, you must have a level 30 account with an honor level of 3+, which has never received a punishment for toxic behaviour (similar to the requirements to make a PBE account).  This would prove that the permabanned player has reformed.\r\n\r\nNow, after they get their account back, give them a very, very long chat restriction. Make them have a maximum for two message at a time,and the ban lasts 100-200 games, maybe even the rest of the season. Perhaps ban them from ranked queues for the duration of their chat ban, since in my experience ranked appears to blossom toxic behavior. \r\n\r\nThat's my proposal to give perma-banned players a second chance. Of course, at even the slightest gesture of toxicity, ban them again and make them ineligible to appeal again.\r\n\r\nNow, I have a suggestion to help players realize that they are being toxic.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost players say things they do not mean in the heat of a game, and regret it heavily afterwards. I know I have.\r\n\r\nHowever, there's something we can do to help with this!\r\n\r\nIn the old client, there was something of a notifaction, that told you that you had been recently reported for verbal abuse, and that you should watch what you say in game.  We should bring this back (and actually make it work, unlike the gifting pop-up).\r\n\r\nI also know that your Honor progress will get slowed if you're being toxic, but not toxic enough to warrant a punishment - but without a notifcation. I think you should get a popup-, similar to a reform card, saying something alongs of the lines: \"Greetings Summonor.  You have recently exhibited unsportsmanlike behavior on the battlefield, and your Honor progress has been slowed. We know League can get heated at times, but please keep things respectful on the Fields of Justice!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm not an expert by any means, but I really think that these changes could help. Please share your opinions! I'd love to hear them.\r\n\r\nHave an amazing rest of your day or night. :)","replies":[{"poster":"Uriel","date":"2019-05-11T10:49:19.522+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":1,"body":"If 3 prior warnings/suspensions aren't a warning enough that someone is being toxic, I honest to god don't know what else will be.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Arcade Lulu","date":"2019-05-11T11:11:08.747+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":1,"body":"if permabanned people got their account back\nPermaban wouldn't be a big punishemnt anymore\n\nYour friend should've thought about that before flaming.

You're a manipulator that's mad about getting caught and called out so you've attempted to flip it into \"stalking\" to try to regain control.

What I suggested in my post might not be the best, because of course riot did try something like this long ago,  but I think that nowadays the success rate might be better, since now we have free rewards and honor.

Whenever I get frustrated I simply yell and rage at the screen or punch a pillow or something and never take it out on others in-game. It is not Riot's nor anyone elses job to control someones behavior for them, and while they can certainly try to encourage players to vent their frustrations through other out-of-game outlets if the players won't do that and wind up getting punished for it then quite frankly that's on them and not Riot.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Sebastit7d","date":"2019-05-11T14:14:28.471+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sounds to me like your friend got banned from toxicity in chat, which takes multiple steps to result in a permaban, the fact that he said \"if i knew it was a perma ban i'd never talk again\" means he got through multiple warnings and kept being toxic.
