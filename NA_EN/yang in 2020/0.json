It won't let me scroll down or anything.  Going to settings and adjusting the window size does nothing either.  If I exit the client entirely and log back in though everything is fine and back to normal.  Another side note is that since this issue started happening (time-wise it's only been going on since about a day after the last patch so like 5 days ago or so) when I click the victory/defeat button the end-game screen takes a good 20-30 secs to load now whereas normally I'd get it in about 1-3 secs. \r\n\r\nNot game-breaking, but it is frustrating that I have to exit and log back in after every game I play.","replies":[{"poster":"Rakellan","date":"2017-06-12T18:29:13.468+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the same thing is happening to me\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"Yang in 2020","date":"2017-06-09T19:28:31.521+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I deleted those files and went into a custom to get settings how I needed them to be as instructed.

It almost seems like the client is trying to draw itself into an incredibly small space, which could be because the config files are a little screwy. Let's try resetting those really quick to see if that helps.\n\n- Log into the game client\n- Navigate to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config\n- Delete the file  named **game.cfg** and **persistedsettings.json**\n- Go into a custom game and verify that settings have saved properly. \n- Leave game to sync settings","replies":[]}]}
