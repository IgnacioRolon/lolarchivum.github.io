Azir's roughly 3000 years old, as of our latest timeline guess (thanks to Scathlocke). Based on his splash my current size estimate for him is 8'5 and probably 400 pounds with all that armor, though Ascended in their prime can get as tall as 15 feet with their full power unleashed. Darkin vary a bit more depending on how completely they've overtaken their host - Aatrox's about 12 feet tall while Varus and Rhaast wouldn't be as big. Nasus is a pretty normal height when he's fighting with Ryze, but the Ascended were much, MUCH bigger in their prime, for instance in \"Where Icathia Once Stood.\" I'm thinking it does have to do with magical power, perhaps fading over time.\n\nFavorite things? Nashramae is a great easter egg but I honestly can't pick a favorite.

They are opposed to Irelia and seem to want to unite Navori. Irelia does too, but she takes a more empathic and magical approach.

We have a lot of worldwide representation but nothing is 100% matching sub Saharan Africa, Australia (aboriginal or \"prison island\" era), or native American cultures (north or south - Buhru language borrows from the Aztecs though). Just some examples.\n\n2. It was kind of inevitable that we'd have a huge amount of ??? space. The world's been pretty small (relatively) and connected the whole time. Other continents, island chains, etc should end up being REALLY isolated from Valoran and Shurima, enough that it can warrant a lack of interaction. Big dangerous ocean that'd take months to cross, etc. It's like the Americas vs Eurasia.\n\n3.
