As a LoL Champion Sound Designer, I actively record, compose, and edit sound effects for our champs. We have   an immensely talented Audio Team for LoL and each of us are embedded within the development team of each Champion, just like animators, visual effects artists, and gameplay designers. \n\nThat said, we do come together frequently to share what we all work on independently to gather feedback and inspiration from one another. \n\nHappy to share more info if you want!","replies":[]}]}]}]}
