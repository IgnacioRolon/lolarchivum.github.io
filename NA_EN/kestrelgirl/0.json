Shurima worships the Sun, Ionia worships the spirit of the land (ancestors also get some time of day), Demacia loves the Winged Protector {{champion:10}} as well as having the Veiled Lady {{champion:25}} as part of their mythos, Noxus really likes Wolf, Pilt/Zaun has some stuff around the Gray Lady and {{champion:40}}, and of course there's Nagakabouros. Freljord even has multiple faiths or at least groups of deities; {{champion:34}} {{champion:106}} {{champion:516}} clash with the Three Sisters.

Leaning toward barter as you mentioned.\n- I can definitely see Jhin learning other languages for amusement and future use; it's probably become much easier to obtain resources on such things since the Noxian invasion ended. You mentioned other champions who are multilingual; I know Camille is one.\n- We'll probably see more in Realms of Runeterra, which has some freaky Aspect concept art, but I'd expect the sun and moon to just go by whatever the local language calls them.\n- The lore server established (alongside Bioluminescence) that Runeterra does, in fact, have tectonic plates! Give this a look. https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/457316449594245150/572216592423714836/Tectonics_Canon.png \nConsidering Runeterra's also an Earth-like (and probably roughly Earth-sized) oblate spheroid, I would expect it to have similar weather patterns as well, though maybe with more magic.\n- Mass extinction - Well... Look at the vastaya page. The intro got changed pretty recently. SOMETHING happened. Something BIG, and we'll hopefully see more soon!\n- Now that's an audacious theory. I wonder if we'll learn anything in future content. Riot's got so much of that incoming!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CaptainMårvelous","date":"2019-10-22T07:00:01.913+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Piltover/Zaun is one of the few regions of the world to get the full stack of seasons.

Would expect P/Z to be warmer with blurrier seasons than some of inland Valoran, e.g. parts of Demacia, though...

Voidspawn tend to come out of extremely conspicuous rifts, or Void-corrupted areas like Icathia.","replies":[{"poster":"mrmeddyman","date":"2019-10-22T03:00:49.044+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think that is the result of a little discrepancy in the lore. The Void have been re-characterized as a long dormant threat slowly leaking back into the world.
