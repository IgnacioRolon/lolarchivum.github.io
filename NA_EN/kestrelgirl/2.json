I'm just waiting to see the hilarity of the Teemo-Tristana-Rumble love triangle in action. \n\nAlso, we had two patches since the last lore update; Riot better give us some big dumps from here on out to make up for it!","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Scathlocke","date":"2019-05-14T19:56:36.316+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I presume you've all seen the updated Bandle City page on Universe, complete with some brand new artwork and explanations of yordle glamour?","replies":[{"poster":"EdgeLady","date":"2019-05-14T23:04:25.733+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Scathlocke,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=N1GkMWKy,comment-id=00060000000000000000,timestamp=2019-05-14T19:56:36.316+0000)\n>\n> I presume you've all seen the updated Bandle City page on Universe, complete with some brand new artwork and explanations of yordle glamour?\n\nOf course, but there are many things still yet to be revealed about the Yordles we know! We have one Yordle who has interestingly joined a group of the most spiritually-connected humans out there {{champion:85}}, another with connections to both his home city and Piltover, leading us to not even know where he resides at the moment {{champion:42}}, and of course, {{champion:17}}. I don't think I need to say any more about him. But I should hope you have exciting things in store for us with ALL the Yordles, and coming as soon as it can come. {{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Scathlocke","date":"2019-05-14T23:17:32.173+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"If *I* lived in a magical realm outside time and space, we could have done all of this already...\n\n{{sticker:vlad-salute}}","replies":[{"poster":"EdgeLady","date":"2019-05-15T01:27:23.027+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Scathlocke,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=N1GkMWKy,comment-id=0006000000000000000000010000,timestamp=2019-05-14T23:17:32.173+0000)\n>\n> If *I* lived in a magical realm outside time and space, we could have done all of this already...\n> \n> {{sticker:vlad-salute}}\n\nSo now I'll just wait for future Scathlocke to come back in time and tell everyone the Yordle lore that's coming in so many months/years.
