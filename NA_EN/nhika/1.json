She scales way too fast compared to other Marksman (I legit just need a Stormrazor + Pickaxe and Beserkers for the Q and E evolve).\n\nSometimes the idea of Kai'Sa being everything that Varus was suppose to be crosses my mind but at the same time due to so many character defining changes i'm not really sure what he's suppose to be anymore (since he was the very first original Hybrid Marksman that we got in League, since he was released during the start of Season 2). Putting aside how strong she is, what I mean by that is that, Varus just doesn't really scale that well (you can't commit to a half AD and half AP build because your damage will fall off and it won't be high enough as others, so you're essentially forced to make a choice in what you will have fall off) as well as...\n\n* Most of his damage is heavily reduced by resistances or his own abilities do that (Q damage is reduced by 33% when hitting 5 targets, that's the highest own damage reducement in the game).\n\n* His W and R won't scale since you most likely won't buy any AP on him, and if you buy AP items your Q and E won't scale.\n\n* His combo is possibly the slowest in the game out of all Marksman, and most Marksman do what he offers better and Safer, the only exception maybe being is his R being the strongest thing about him (but that alone won't help you out if you can't follow up to do your combo).\n\nI guess in the end of the day Varus _IS_ the most balanced Hybrid champion.","replies":[{"poster":"Ackelope","date":"2019-05-23T15:39:35.400+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"varus offers aoe cc that really has the potential to change the tide of a fight entirely, as well as long range damage and powerful execute damage with the active portion of the W that was added a while back.

I'm not saying that we need to add mobility to varus, but I think that his lack of mobility combined with the fact that he has a utility ult and isn't a hypercarry means that he's immobile and can be caught out and killed extremely easily, and doesn't have the pop-off potential of someone like a jinx.

Then I realized she has no cc whatsoever which makes her really reliant on getting peel and she loses almost every trade in lane fought in the minion wave because her q is most of her damage and it doesn't prioritize champions. After that it wasn't nearly as hard to lane against her. I'm just glad they nerfed her w so it doesn't do ludicrous base damage anymore. Yes her q does too much damage if you decided to fight outside the wave, and yes her late game is pretty strong but that's just the way it is","replies":[{"poster":"LordGeovanni","date":"2019-05-24T05:55:26.070+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kai'sa isnt even reliant on something that adcs get anyway like peel you can dart around with e spam because it has an innately low cooldown and its lowered with auto attacks.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Nhika","date":"2019-05-24T02:03:25.881+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"bump","replies":[]},{"poster":"Poske","date":"2019-05-23T21:43:56.514+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kaisa / Kassadin IDK which but one of this 2 has to be the biggest winrate enhancer (When you win only because your champion is OP)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ahri Baka","date":"2019-05-23T20:35:12.211+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Last time I posted something like that I going downvoted to hell\n\nI wonder why Kai'sa has defenders , this champion has 50% pick rate\n\nthe best champion in the whole damn game along with Ezreal\n\nAt least Ezreal isn't a hyper carry like her\n\nOf course she will have 49% winrate when her pickrate is insanely high","replies":[]},{"poster":"The thigh guy","date":"2019-05-23T18:36:02.618+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Squishy, immobile after engaging, no hard cc. \n\nLitteraly all this champion does is damage.
