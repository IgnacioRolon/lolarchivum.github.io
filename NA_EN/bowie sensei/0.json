The patch screen where you see the champion rotation and can repair the game or hit Launch is zoomed in for some reason, so I cant hit the gear or close icons to attempt a repair. Also, when I just hi Launch, the box goes away and the Log In screen never appears. It just doesnt do anything. When I tried setting my  Display options to Small for my icons instead of Medium, It seemed to fix the Zoom In issue, but I do not like having that setting on, I largely prefer Medium Icons. As for the game not wanting to Launch, I've no idea. Any suggestions?","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2014-11-26T02:24:32.324+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello Bowie Sensei!\n\nIt seems like you are mentioning two separate issues in your post.
