They wouldn't want to give him attention now that would've actually been wasted since he'd be getting something entirely new. If we're lucky, around this time next year, we might actually see him.","replies":[{"poster":"Xela Syab","date":"2015-11-04T17:27:36.529+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just hope he has more interaction with his zombies, I'd rather have a big zombie that I could upgrade or augment with spells. Yorick is in a bad spot lore and fantasy wise because we already have an undead juggernaut (Sion) and a necromancer lich (Karthus) if anything they should move his lore with Zaun / Noxian lore and make him more of and hextech plague cyborg.","replies":[{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2015-11-04T20:53:21.338+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"[This](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/User_blog:Emptylord/Yorick's_Rework) is what Xelnath had last updated us with before she passed it over to, I think, Sion's team.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"The Only Doctor","date":"2015-10-29T03:24:28.352+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I also don't see Yorick as being so much a part of the Harrowing event.
