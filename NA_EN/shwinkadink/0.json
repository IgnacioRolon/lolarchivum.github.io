For the past few weeks now, I've been playing with regular 69 ms, and out of nowhere it spikes to 500 then drops to 250 and fluctuates around there for a few hours. It rarely drops down to regular, but if it does, it's only a short amount of time before it jumps back up to 250-270. Anyone know if they're going to be doing some maintenance anytime soon?","replies":[{"poster":"Archgoose","date":"2016-08-30T03:52:21.811+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bump.\n\nI too have been having similar issues.  Some times the servers work just fine, other times the game lag spikes so hard it's virtually unplayable.  Before I go into Ranked I play a game of ARAM just to see if the servers are going to cooperate at that time, and if they aren't then I just have to not play League (which sucks because generally I plan time to play League, so when it's not working that's a huge bummer).  I've done all the things on the recommended Support Page, and it's not my internet (during a lag spike session I did a Speed Test, I had 64 mbps connection with no latency issues), so it must be something with League, I presume on their Server side, because as I said some times it's perfectly fine, other times unplayably laggy.","replies":[{"poster":"MillionsTheThird","date":"2016-08-30T04:25:06.615+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Archgoose,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=aoOPkYZB,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-08-30T03:52:21.811+0000)\n>\n> Bump.\n> \n> I too have been having similar issues.

Ping spikes to 300+ and i just cant move as i watch chaos unfold in front of me. Checked everything. This seems to be server side issues.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"terrorstorm88","date":"2016-08-31T05:09:13.816+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm having the same exact issue right now.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-30T15:35:24.517+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because you've been seeing high latency for a few weeks, I suspect there may have been changes to your ISP routing that gets you to the server. To investigate into this, we can run a traceroute log which will give us an in-depth view of your exact path to the servers.\n\nYou can run one with a networking app called [WinMTR](http://winmtr.net/). After launching the app, run a traceroute with the IP address 104.160.131.1 for 5 minutes, then export the results and paste them here in a reply.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"EdgyTryHard","date":"2016-08-30T08:40:33.249+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Happened to me too, except on the east coast. I am usually at a decent 40 ping, but tonight its been jacked up to 250 for the past 2 games, making the champs i play become unresponsive or delayed.  Its frustrating because i like hexakill but i work on weekends and I can't enjoy it before it ends tomorrow.{{item:3070}} {{item:3070}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"A Thru Zed","date":"2016-08-30T05:24:05.797+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Currently undergoing the same thing. At first I thought it might be the ISP one day, but it has been a couple days since the first time it happened (patch 6.17 release). Now I am currently pinging the riot servers using the command prompt. I was pinging 104.160.131.3 and it was running fine for a bit. Booted up a custom. \nEverything's good until about 6-7minutes in boom. Lag. Unmoveable. With Control+F it claims about 200ms, but it's more like 5000ms.\n Along with pretty severe packet loss (up to 7 in a row were lost with many others in similar \"clumps\")\nI have never had this type of problem before I would LOVE a fix because I would like to enjoy an entire game of league with 0 lag, like the good ol' days of 6.16.","replies":[]}]}
