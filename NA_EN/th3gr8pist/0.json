While you claim to be referring to cigarettes, I'm afraid that's a claim that holds no water with Riot -- the use of that word to refer to people simply isn't acceptable, and if you wished to call them cigarettes as an insult for some reason you should have used the word cigarette instead of a word more strongly associated with homophobic hate speech, *especially* when used as an insulting term towards someone.\n\nUnfortunately, I must tell you that the account is unrecoverable due to this behavior.
