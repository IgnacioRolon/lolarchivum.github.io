I wasn't able to see a match where you lost 50 LP.  I do see that you were at exactly at 50 LP at one point but is fluctuating as normal after each match.  If you need anymore context or specifics, we'd be happy to offer it individually to you in a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).  Let me know if that clears things up!","replies":[]}]}
