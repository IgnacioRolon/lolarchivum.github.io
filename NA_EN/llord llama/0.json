{"poster":"Llord Llama","date":"2019-12-12T20:19:44.636+0000","title":"TFT: What's Coming for Items in 10.1!","subforum":"Dev Corner","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"**TL;DR: We’re hitting the items in TFT - adding some new ones, and updating others.**\n\n{{item:3035}} {{item:3025}} {{item:3076}} \n\nHi everyone! In this post we're talking about the items we're updating in patch 10.1. Our goals were threefold: \n\n* Address some problem items that promised fun payoffs but had a lot of trouble delivering.\n* Help some items scale through the game by linking their power to the user’s star level.\n* Give more exciting gameplay to tanky champions. \n\nHere's the list:\n\n**Last Whisper REPLACES Repeating Crossbow**\n\n_Last Whisper: When the wearer inflicts a critical hit, the target’s Armor is reduced by 90% for 3 seconds._\n\nIn theory, Repeating Crossbow had a clear fantasy with huge upside. In practice, there was just too much downtime as it from champion to champion. It also couldn’t jump to a champion who was already full on items, which meant it tended to avoid your carries rather than boosting their stats even more. This also played especially poorly with Set 2’s elemental hexes, which consume an item slot.\n\nSo, we’re creating a new item: Last Whisper. When its user scores a critical hit, the target’s Armor is massively reduced for a few seconds. This can let your whole team, not just damage dealers, chunk down a formerly-tough target.\n\n**Bramble Vest REPLACES Thornmail**\n\n_Bramble Vest: Negates bonus damage from critical hits on the wearer. When the wearer is hit by a Basic Attack, a hail of thorns hits nearby enemies for 80/120/160 magic damage (increases with the holder's star level and can only damage once per second). _\n\nThornmail is a great example of an item that’s fantastic on one champion (Braum) and bad-to-awful on everyone else, because if it’s balanced around broad playability, it will become horribly overpowered on Braum (or any future champion who’s all about big mitigation).\n\nRather than tweak Thornmail, or nerf it into oblivion, we’ve decided to replace it. Bramble Vest combines a bit of Phantom Dancer with a saner version of Thornmail’s damage-to-attackers. It’s also our first star-scaled item; the damage from the thorns depends on the wearer’s star level.\n\n**Titan’s Resolve REPLACES Phantom Dancer**\n\n~~Titan’s Resolve: When the wearer is hit by a source of damage, they gain a 2.5% stacking damage increase (stacks infinitely).~~\n\n_(Updated version coming to PBE soon!) Titan’s Resolve: When the wearer takes damage or inflicts a critical hit, they gain a 1% stacking damage bonus. Stacks up to 80 times, at which point the wearer gains 25 Armor and Magic Resistance, and increases in size._\n\n_**12/17 Update**: After additional testing, we needed to dial back Titan's Resolve a bit - or at least reduce its ceiling. Most of the time, it's fine... except when playing against Inferno teams, where its sensitive trigger led to some pretty insane stack counts. But it's fun to watch a stack count rise fast, so solutions like narrowing the trigger or imposing an internal cooldown weren't very appealing. The solution we landed on - imposing a reasonable stack cap and then giving extra tanky stats when the wearer hits it - let us maintain the fun feeling of the item while not having it be a hard counter for Inferno and, to a lesser extent, Summoner teams._\n\n_Also: in early testing, we'd had a size increase built in (raid boss Leona!) but got feedback that size increases imply toughness and resilience rather than more damage. Since the reward for hitting the stack cap is now more tankiness, the size increase is back!_\n\nPhantom Dancer received a significant change in 9.24, but since we ultimately wanted Bramble Vest to fill the anti-crit, anti-assassin role, giving tanks some opportunity to hit back made a lot of sense - especially on an item that grants Attack Speed. Since Bramble Vest renders Phantom Dancer redundant, we created Titan’s Resolve (aka “Leona’s Revenge.”) You want this item on champions who will take a lot of hits and stay standing to reap the benefits of a huge pile of Titan stacks.\n\nThat’s it for the new items. What about item updates?\n\n**Iceborn Gauntlet**\n\n_Old: Creates a zone of ice that expands when the wearer Dodges, slowing enemies' Attack Speed by 25%.\nNew: After casting a spell, the wearer’s next Basic Attack freezes the target for 1.5 seconds._\n\nIceborn Gauntlet promised a wonderful dream - cover the map in a layer of ice and chill the enemy team into helplessness wherever they stood. But the visual overlap with Frozen Heart’s effect felt bad and was visually unclear with varying the magnitude of the slow. Additionally, any item that triggers from Dodge will have some extreme cases (Jax for example) that make it difficult to balance.\n\nWe hearkened back to our League of Legends roots, and gave the Gauntlet a freeze effect on basic attacks. Ezreal can finally feel good about matching the glove to the rest of his outfit like he does on the Rift.\n\n**Quicksilver**\n\n_Old: Prevents the next crowd control effect applied to the wearer. Refreshes every 3 seconds.\nNew: The wearer is immune to crowd control effects._\n\nQuicksilver’s value was hard to get a read on, and the timing of its refresh could make it feel useless when it was needed most. Not anymore!\n\n**Frozen Heart**\n\n_Old: Reduces the Attack Speed of nearby enemies by 25%.\nNew: Reduces the Attack Speed of nearby enemies by 40% (stacking increases the radius of this effect)._\n\nAttack Speed drives so many gameplay dynamics in Teamfight Tactics that allowing it to get debuffed to very low levels has many knock-on effects: slower rounds, too-broad usefulness against enemy auto-attackers AND casters, etc. A radius increase will help Frozen Heart stacking remain relevant without turning TFT into NURF mode.\n\n**Locket of the Iron Solari, Statikk Shiv, and Luden’s Echo now scale based on the wearer’s star level**\n\nIt’s OK for items to fall off in the late game after conferring an early advantage, but we’d like to be able to control this better, and we’d also like to avoid the buyer’s remorse that comes with building an item that “everyone knows” becomes unacceptably weak once the game has gone a certain length.\n\n**Ionic Spark**\n\n_Old: Whenever an enemy casts their Ability, they take 90 true damage.\nNew: Enemies within 3 hexes that cast a spell are zapped, taking magic damage equal to 200% of their max Mana._\n\nIonic Spark was an indiscriminate item: it hit the whole board, so no positional play could provide an escape, and it affected all casters equally. The new version now asks players to decide how to deploy it: on the frontline, where it will help burn the enemy frontline but miss the casters in the back? Or on assassins, where it might help kill the squishy casters earlier? Also, the fact that Ionic Spark treated big and small spells the same was a little strange, so now the damage depends on the spell’s mana cost.\n\nEnjoy the rest of the year, and I'm excited to see all the screenshots of the biggest Titan’s Resolve stacks when 10.1 goes live!","replies":[{"poster":"Azurereaper","date":"2019-12-12T20:26:59.487+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":13,"body":"Thornmail too good on certain champs like Braum.\n\nAlso heres Titan Resolve that will be too good on Braum.\n\n???\n\nCould you also remove infinite stacking effects from tft, they ruin the game when you have Glacial Olaf abusing infinite attack speed boosts.","replies":[{"poster":"FridgeD","date":"2019-12-12T20:51:27.652+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":1,"body":"thornmail on hyper braum can legit one-man-carry a game, because the dmg potential of the equipped champ doesnt matter.\n\nthe new item will boost your existing dmg. 200% increase on braum? he has no dmg spell and laughable auto dmg. 3 times 0 is still 0.","replies":[{"poster":"Azurereaper","date":"2019-12-12T20:59:05.793+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":8,"body":"Except you can make him cc immune give an infinite as item or a warmogs with it.

That because most of these items have abilities that are so niche, they're going to feel hard to build without requiring you to commit a whole ton to make them work and further worsen that feel of not getting the right components.\n\nTitan's Fall? Looks great on paper, but the amount of hits the carrier needs to take before the damage starts comparing to that of an Infinity Edge, Morellonomicon or Giant Slayer likely means that in practice, you need 2 other defensive items preferably on a 3 Star Champion to make it competitive.\n\nInfinite scaling is an awesome concept, but if it just had been a 5 stack damage buff that came online a couple of seconds into the fight, it would be a great item for melee and tank champions in general and you don't pigeonhole yourself into a \"you must get all the right components to make this build work\" kind of item. \n\nSame with Iceborn Gauntlet. _Amazing_ on low cost mana Champions, but it's only going to be mediocre on anyone else. Which wouldn't be much of a problem if there were a bunch of low mana cost abilities, but they still tend to be fairly scarce. Just like how Thornmail only got built on Braum, Luden's Echo has historically only been built on one or two champions tops---and now there's a second item to join it in that marriage.\n\nHowever, I love the change to Quicksilver as it removes it entirely from the niche category and turns it into a generally good survival item. If it also blocks Poison's permanent mana cost increase, even better and a good counter to Singed comps.","replies":[{"poster":"ScarletVixen","date":"2019-12-17T08:28:46.199+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I sort of agree on some things here, but there are much bigger problems with these changes. \n\nAs far as poison goes... the synergy itself is fine overall, the problem is A: Singed being immune to CC B: enemy AI has no idea how to interact with him C: Stacked with items he hurts BAD. D: Stacked Mundo is gross late game since his ult works the way it does. It does too much\n\nThe problem these new items create... is hell when used on comps that are very strong right now. \n\nTitan's Resolve: If its components are the same as the item its replacing it'll be recurve and chain vest. An item that grants more damage for getting hit is super good on \"Predator\" comps. Imagine a predator comp with Rek'Sai; Skarner and Warwick all with one of these along with other items they're good with along with the already powerful predator execute. Steel champions are immune but still get hit by autos, and by the new items description, steel champions rendered immune will continue to gain AD while immune. Which means Predator or Nocturne hyper carry comps will do very well with this item. That's not even mentioning already existing problem champs like Renekton, Mundo, and Warwick who are notorious for their self healing ability and them being impossible to kill with stacked items to ramp their healing. Add Titan's Resolve to the mix and this exacerbates the problem even harder. (Yes Olaf can use it, but he demands too many other items to make room for this, you can, but it's not ideal) \nNow Imagine Rek'sai, with Bramble Vest (thorn aoe damage and no bonus crit damage) Titan's Resolve (stacking AD when hit) with Death Blade. Since Thornmail worked with predator execute, Bramble will also. You thought Predator was good before? You haven't seen anything yet.\n\nIonic Spark... who even used this item let alone used it effectively? If you're against 2 or 3 other players going 6 mage comps (even worse if it's 6 mage/summoner/shadow comps) Ionic Spark did almost nothing to deal with them. It's easy to get the synergies with them and they are strong in all points of the game. Ionic spark never hurt any of them enough to really be a significant threat to these comps in the first place, and won't really be an issue with the changes against existing mage comps. They'll still body your teams entirely if allowed to get to completion, which they usually do, whether you have Ionic Spark or not.\n\nIceborn Gauntlet I agree with you on. It is amazing on spammy champions and it actually makes things infinitely worse considering, by the description, it is an on-hit effect. So champions like Sivir, or Kindred can use it super well. Imagine a Sivir with Iceborn, Hush and Sword Breaker? She doesn't even need a blademaster comp, just one other for the 2 set bonus so she gets a bit of attacks and the % chances for disable on 2, and the guaranteed freeze with iceborn will make her one of the strongest champions in the entire game. Kindred, Ezreal and Kha'zix also use it very well since they ult rapidly and their items are designed to make them ult even faster than normal. Combined with how Glacial works, just a bronze glacial buff with these items on choice champions will perma stun entire teams with less effort than before.\n\nThe Quicksilver change, is super good, and at least gives SOME room for comps to work in a game plagued with permanent CC comps that leave units stunned for 3 seconds on average, sometimes multiple at once. \n\nLudens... it's meh, and will be even with the changes. It does nothing to make it more useful than other items that use the Tear; like Shojin and Seraph's and the Mage Cap to turn any champion into a mage (some of the most popular items in the game). No one in their right mind is going to waste a tear on Ludens when it's more valuable on items designed to make champions spam spells even harder. Mage Cap on ANY summoner for example, is a nightmare and a half, and impossible to beat when they get to late game most of the time. \n\nTLDR:\n\nTitan's Resolve will be used on Predator, Steel, or Renekton/Mundo/Warwick/Skarner to turn them from super powerful execution or impossible to kill quickly champs, into being even stronger than before. \n\nBramble Vest: You thought Predator comps executing themselves on Thornmail was bad? Wait until you see Bramble vest aoe every second executing multiple champs at once. Fun right? No bonus crit so harder to kill, then add Titan's Resolve for stacking AD when their hit so they execute your champs even faster. So much fun. Amazing new mechanics that totally won't balance the game at all. \n\nIonic Spark: Isn't useful vs Mage comps now, isn't with the changes. Deal with it.\n\nIceborn: More stuns. Cuz that's what we need right now. \n\nLudens: Why use a tear on this piece of trash when I can save it for Seraph's, Shojin or Mage Cap since they're superior items anyway?\n\nQuicksilver: Nice change, too bad you need it for 3 or more champs to win a game against the ocean of stuns that is the current state of the game right now.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"yeulx","date":"2019-12-12T21:12:59.273+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hands down one of the best changes imo is the Quicksilver changes,     for instance playing against glacial   my entire front line was perma locked in cc at 4 glacials to the point where they couldnt cast their ultis  because they would be instantly frozen the moment the last freeze effect came undone,    this was originally what quicksilver should have done so im happy it finally got its change","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kenrutl","date":"2019-12-17T20:09:30.056+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is frozen heart still stacking multiplicatively if the debuff Target is within range of two separate units with the item ?

Titan’s Resolve: When the wearer takes damage or inflicts a critical hit, they gain a 1% stacking damage bonus. Stacks up to 80 times, at which point the wearer gains 25 Armor and Magic Resistance, and increases in size._\n> \n> _**12/17 Update**: After additional testing, we needed to dial back Titan's Resolve a bit - or at least reduce its ceiling. Most of the time, it's fine... except when playing against Inferno teams, where its sensitive trigger led to some pretty insane stack counts. But it's fun to watch a stack count rise fast, so solutions like narrowing the trigger or imposing an internal cooldown weren't very appealing. The solution we landed on - imposing a reasonable stack cap and then giving extra tanky stats when the wearer hits it - let us maintain the fun feeling of the item while not having it be a hard counter for Inferno and, to a lesser extent, Summoner teams._\n> \n> _Also: in early testing, we'd had a size increase built in (raid boss Leona!) but got feedback that size increases imply toughness and resilience rather than more damage. Since the reward for hitting the stack cap is now more tankiness, the size increase is back!_\n> \n> Phantom Dancer received a significant change in 9.24, but since we ultimately wanted Bramble Vest to fill the anti-crit, anti-assassin role, giving tanks some opportunity to hit back made a lot of sense - especially on an item that grants Attack Speed. Since Bramble Vest renders Phantom Dancer redundant, we created Titan’s Resolve (aka “Leona’s Revenge.”) You want this item on champions who will take a lot of hits and stay standing to reap the benefits of a huge pile of Titan stacks.\n> \n> That’s it for the new items. What about item updates?\n> \n> **Iceborn Gauntlet**\n> \n> _Old: Creates a zone of ice that expands when the wearer Dodges, slowing enemies' Attack Speed by 25%.\n> New: After casting a spell, the wearer’s next Basic Attack freezes the target for 1.5 seconds._\n> \n> Iceborn Gauntlet promised a wonderful dream - cover the map in a layer of ice and chill the enemy team into helplessness wherever they stood. But the visual overlap with Frozen Heart’s effect felt bad and was visually unclear with varying the magnitude of the slow. Additionally, any item that triggers from Dodge will have some extreme cases (Jax for example) that make it difficult to balance.\n> \n> We hearkened back to our League of Legends roots, and gave the Gauntlet a freeze effect on basic attacks. Ezreal can finally feel good about matching the glove to the rest of his outfit like he does on the Rift.\n> \n> **Quicksilver**\n> \n> _Old: Prevents the next crowd control effect applied to the wearer. Refreshes every 3 seconds.\n> New: The wearer is immune to crowd control effects._\n> \n> Quicksilver’s value was hard to get a read on, and the timing of its refresh could make it feel useless when it was needed most. Not anymore!\n> \n> **Frozen Heart**\n> \n> _Old: Reduces the Attack Speed of nearby enemies by 25%.\n> New: Reduces the Attack Speed of nearby enemies by 40% (stacking increases the radius of this effect)._\n> \n> Attack Speed drives so many gameplay dynamics in Teamfight Tactics that allowing it to get debuffed to very low levels has many knock-on effects: slower rounds, too-broad usefulness against enemy auto-attackers AND casters, etc. A radius increase will help Frozen Heart stacking remain relevant without turning TFT into NURF mode.\n> \n> **Locket of the Iron Solari, Statikk Shiv, and Luden’s Echo now scale based on the wearer’s star level**\n> \n> It’s OK for items to fall off in the late game after conferring an early advantage, but we’d like to be able to control this better, and we’d also like to avoid the buyer’s remorse that comes with building an item that “everyone knows” becomes unacceptably weak once the game has gone a certain length.\n> \n> **Ionic Spark**\n> \n> _Old: Whenever an enemy casts their Ability, they take 90 true damage.\n> New: Enemies within 3 hexes that cast a spell are zapped, taking magic damage equal to 200% of their max Mana._\n> \n> Ionic Spark was an indiscriminate item: it hit the whole board, so no positional play could provide an escape, and it affected all casters equally. The new version now asks players to decide how to deploy it: on the frontline, where it will help burn the enemy frontline but miss the casters in the back? Or on assassins, where it might help kill the squishy casters earlier? Also, the fact that Ionic Spark treated big and small spells the same was a little strange, so now the damage depends on the spell’s mana cost.\n> \n> Enjoy the rest of the year, and I'm excited to see all the screenshots of the biggest Titan’s Resolve stacks when 10.1 goes live!\n\n\nCan you answer to my post please \nhttps://utft.gg/profile/euw1/fifoux38410/overview\nhttps://utft.gg/profile/euw1/defacyde/overview\n\nOne account in diamond, one another coming.\nPlay warden and thornmail since the start of set 2 and set 1 also (you can check log if you want to verify)\n\nUsed thornmail mostly on Nasus and Thresh, used last season on Shyv and Darius\nWhat did you  have to say to all player that use this properly and made it mendatory?

A rose by any other name is still a rose.  Yes, you're combining it with PD's (super gutted) passive.  Yes, you're modifying the exact manner in which damage is reflected.  The end line though is that it's still Thornmail, regardless of what you want to call it.\n\nIf anything, it's actually much much stranger that you're buffing Thornmail, whilst replacing the name &amp; picture with a COMPONENT item (Bramble Vest) which just has objectively less-impactful artwork &amp; carries the mental stigma of being considered an inferior item (since it's literally a component.)\n\nMy suggestion: stop needlessly messing with us and just continue continue using the Thornmail name &amp; artwork.","replies":[]}]}
