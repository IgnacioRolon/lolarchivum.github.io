Further, the idea that I have to suffer these types of players in silence creates an innate hostility against teammates. I.e. I can deal with losing to a competent opponent, but having to also combat my teammates to win is extremely tilting. Going forward I don't intend on communicating with teammates at all. As doing so does far more harm than good.

Arguing otherwise nullifies the responsibility of players to learn how to properly play this game.

Because in no other competitive context, even down to the amateurs, are participants expected to suffer teammates that do not care about winning. \n\nPlayers also understand the flaw and innate unfairness of Riot's disciplinary system. Losing a game is not the problem, it's losing via players that troll and intentionally feed that causes frustration amongst players that actually care about how their performance affects their teams. \n\nFinally, your analogy is inappropriate because attending a movie isn't a competition. Rest assured, if a teammate in your local rec basketball game received a pass and immediately launchd the ball out of bounds, or ran it down the other side of the court to score in his own goal, he'd be immediately pulled from the game.
