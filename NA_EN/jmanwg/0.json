Someone new to the game will not have the knowledge of every champ capable of using cc and when to dodge them. on top of the fact that you also need to know when to dodge thing like viegar's ult sure its not cc but you die when it hits you, etc... and thats the easy part of learning Master Yi. then you have to utilize when to you his w to reduce damage and when to use it as an aa reset. and the most important thing is when to go in. let's face it you cant just run into the entire enemy team and expect good things youll get destroyed.","replies":[{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2016-06-26T19:48:01.098+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm saying he's not hard to pick up.

Just remember to not fully engage before level 6. His ult steals Health, Armor and Magic Resistence, making  you the tankiest champion when ulting someone else.\n\nJungle: \n**Amumu** is pretty easy champion, you just need to time your Q and not miss your R.\n\n**Warwick** is another easy champion too, devourer and then tanky.\n\nMid:\n**Annie **is pretty simple, you get mana refunded and CDR if you kill minions with your Q, so you never run out of it. Her stuns are easy and she is hard to counter play.\n\n**Ziggs**, even though he is all about skillshots, he has short CD's and you can save yoursel from ganks and the fact that you can destroy turrets under 25% heatlh with your E is ridiculous.  \n\nADC: \nI feel like **Jhin **is pretty easy, not sure about anyone else, and he has an insane damage with good CC and speed buffs, he counters mostly all ADC's right now.\n\n**Cait **is another one that is easy and really strong right now.\n\nSupport:\n**Sona** (though she is geting nerfed soon). She has no skillshots, but her ult. \n\nMy favorite is **Zac **support, his passive is silly in low elo as your opponents usually go for you, and then your passive procs while your ADC gets a double kill as you come back.
