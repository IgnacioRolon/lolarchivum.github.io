This is the completely wrong combination of runes. Magic Pen marks, scaling AP glyphs. You get more out of both that way. Marks are good ad/ap pen, ad, and attack speed. Glyphs are better for AP. Also, AP scaling marks are really bad.... Scaling AP glyphs are the only good ones.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Solidair3","date":"2015-03-09T14:49:52.986+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Scaling is really only useful if you plan to be a big damage dealer come lategame.

Also fun fact, flat mana regen glyphs need 3 minutes to outdo flat bonus mana glyphs so flat mana is about as viable too honestly even though they are hardly used.\n\nGenerally though it's smart to stick to magic resist glyphs if they have magic damage threats. Most supports and some ADCs even have magic damage. Corki ADC does *a lot* of magic damage for one\n\nThat's glyphs in a nutshell\n\nI just checked though and Sona has extremely good AP ratio's so I would go with AP or MR","replies":[]},{"poster":"Drunk Rummate","date":"2015-03-09T14:32:46.748+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i take hybrid pen marks on sona. a lot of her damage comes from her empowered auto attacks so the extra pen on physical and magic damage helps a lot, especially if you build sheen/lich bane at any point.\n\nthe blues i take scaling ap as my preference.","replies":[]},{"poster":"XuWarrior","date":"2015-03-09T14:29:21.913+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Supports = always FLAT AP \n\nReason :\n\nAs a support at early game you need have dmg / poke etc . \n\nAt late you game you are not Carry so you don't scaling runes.

Since you're focused on early harassment, I recommend Hybrid Penetration.  They're almost equivalent to the MPen you already had with Glyphs (0.62 vs. 0.63), and add some APen for your AAs/Spellthief's Edge.  The Tribute proc will do magic damage when you Q, and physical damage when you AA.  I personally prefer using Glyphs defensively for MR, but you can use those for AP.  Flat AP Glyphs are roughly double the strength of AP Marks.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Chin","date":"2015-03-09T05:56:15.836+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"flat runes for support","replies":[]},{"poster":"Stray Kat","date":"2015-03-09T03:23:01.708+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For early game harrass?
