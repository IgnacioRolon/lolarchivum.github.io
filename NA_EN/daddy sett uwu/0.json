Make sure to check out our guide at improving FPS here:\n\nhttps://support.leagueoflegends.com/entries/27870764-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-troubleshooting\n\nKeep in mind though, even though we can provide different steps, we cannot improve your FPS more than your Graphics Card allows.  If your system is only able to run LoL at 30 FPS, then there is nothing that we can do to improve your FPS beyond this.\n\nHope this helps!  If you are still experiencing issues with your FPS, feel free to respond back and provide the following logs so I can help look into it further:\n\n1) Dxdiag information: https://support.leagueoflegends.com/entries/27495980-Network-System-and-League-of-Legends-Logs#wq5\n\n2) Your most recent r3d log where you experienced the problem (You'll notice that the file name starts with the date/time and ends with r3dlog.txt): https://support.leagueoflegends.com/entries/27495980-Network-System-and-League-of-Legends-Logs#wq7","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheSeltzerBaron","date":"2014-09-30T03:53:23.302+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm going to assume your computer is old/underpowered. I sympathize. Mine will be 10 years old next year but I manage 40fps most of the time. Barring a severe problem with your settings or hardware/drivers there's not much you can do to boost your framerate other than upgrading hardware. If you're already running everything at the lowest setting then you're pretty much out of luck.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ritaldo","date":"2014-09-30T03:15:57.736+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Minimal graphics, also there are programs which make your program use almost all of your cpu so if you are just going to play league this is a good idea.
