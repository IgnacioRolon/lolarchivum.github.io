I can&#039;t even remotely enjoy normal games because everyone is just so excessively good at everything, i got smite like to jungle but i just have people come take all the monsters kill me and my laners and we lose. I tried mid but people kill me when i go up to try and kill minions. Ive tried to get better on youtube and everything but people just kill me and i end up losing.\r\n\r\nThen i try to play ARURF but i dont know why i thought it wasnt random, but the games blow. I either do amazingly on a champion that beats the others, or the other guys get something insane and just win by default. Hell people just left my game because they lost against someone, and even i a better score she just killed me over and over. Well, if it ever was fun people definitely dont think so now","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-06-29T02:05:06.438+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> lv13\n\nThat is about 3 days of gameplay, why would you expect to be on a level field with anyone that fast?\n\nIt gets significantly better once your matchmaking rank stabilizes and you learn the basics of the game.\n\nAnd yes, URF with all new players is going to be a shitshow where the lowest skill champ wins, just like all low-level games. No strategy, teamwork, or damage control leaves no other options.","replies":[]},{"poster":"tempname130583","date":"2018-06-29T03:47:01.608+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\" I can't even remotely enjoy normal games because everyone is just so excessively good at everything, \"\n\nSo your telling me you don't like the game because you bad and don't want to get better","replies":[]},{"poster":"Silly Neeko","date":"2018-06-29T03:08:47.130+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I remember my first games of league.....\n\nI would take rengar from the free champ rotation and then bring a hunters machete to top lane and hide in a bush waiting to ambush the top laner, the top laner would always then run back to the tower and i would die because i had no clue of tower ranges xD\n\nIt gets better once you get better.\n\nYou will always have others who are better than you, but thats why you learn from your mistakes and figure things out. I suggest trying out every champ on the free champ rotations a few times in bot games so you figure out what they do and what you like. It gets you familiar with the champions and what they all do.\n\nHeck, you can even read the lore and see if theres any that really peak your interest. Add people that are decent and dont shit talk everyone. Play with them. Learn with them. Also, its not a race. Learn your champ and how to win the matchups. Worry less about kills and more about farming minions, sure poke the enemy out of lane, but 1 wave of minions is about 100 gold, 3 waves of minions is about the same as a regular kill. Work on dodging and predicting, theres tons of things to learn..... you are not going to be an expert in a few days.","replies":[]},{"poster":"NY64","date":"2018-06-29T02:46:31.575+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They used to have a few other game modes that were also very fun like the Star Guardian game mode, Doom Bots, Dark Star Thresh, Nexus siege. Sadly now they have removed them and rarely bring them back because they only want players to be playing for either draft or solo so queue times are shorter.","replies":[]}]}
