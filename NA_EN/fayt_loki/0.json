At first I thought that was like old Gundam, but then I realized I didn't recognize it. Yikes, I can already tell that's one of those super-depressing anime.\n\nBut I did play one-for-all against Lux, and I'll tell you this, we were all Garens. And every single person in the game was skinned, and with quite the variety, from both Steel Legions, to Sorceress and Star Guardian and Imperial, and also Sanguine and Dreadknight and Commando. It was like a showcase.\n\nOne Lux we ganked as a five-man group said, \"ew, I got Garen in my hair and all over my face.\" and all of us are going lol that means two things as we do the Monkey in unison.\n\nThey also seemed to save their ults to use all at once. Many of us were caught in the crossfire between the lanes. It was both hilarious and a little distressing, because I didn't realize until now how much easier to dodge Star Guardian Lux's version of her ult is, especially compared to Steel Legion, which is almost invisible by comparison.\n\nMaybe a little off-topic, but the more I think about it...That doesn't even seem fair, how much more visible Star Guardian is compared to all the others. If you're hitting someone long-range, they can easily spot that, far easier than any other skin.","replies":[{"poster":"KING OF MASKS","date":"2015-10-18T18:11:25.898+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I haven't bought Star Guardian for just that reason.
