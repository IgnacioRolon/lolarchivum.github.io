A button on an item you have to buy that says I remove this effect is even worse. Look at any time Malzahar/Warwick/Skarner are strong in the meta--you now have to buy a QSS if you're a squishy on the enemy team. This is not counterplay, this is just forcing people to buy a suboptimal item. \nCounterplay is Morgana's Dark Binding hitting minions and traveling slowly and having a cast time. You can stand behind minions, dodge it, or worst case situation flash away from it. Counterplay is Gnar's big form having bad mobility, forcing Gnar to hop/crunch in for the GNAR! when his rage is almost full--talk about a well telegraphed engage. You can see it coming, you can spread up, you can slow him down, you can kite back etc. \nKnock-ups are no less or worse in terms of counterplay than stuns or roots. That they're unaffected by tenacity and can't really be cleansed (they CAN be cleansed, at least the part that makes you unable to cast/attack. You're still considered \"in a move block\", so you can't move by right-clicking, but you can, for instance, cleanse an Alistar knockup and Lucian-dash away from it while you're still in mid air) (but this is academical and besides the point) is an artifact of implementation that was later embraced as intentional. We could totally make the choice that tenacity shortens these effects or that cleanse drops you to the ground instantly, but it's not entirely obvious if that would be a net positive. \nTL;DR: Counterplay happens before you are hit by an effect.\"\n\nWhile I personally agree on some parts of your argument...I don´t think your TL/DR is healthy for the game:\n\n- for me Counterplay means that you have a chance to punish your opponent if you manage to outplay (e.g. dodge his ability). THis is sth. that just doesn´t happen for a lot of things in this game currently, old Nida had been a prime example - as everyone noticed that it´s not really counterplay to stand there and dodge spear after spear for an hour with little chance for her to screw up and be engaged on while she won if you just screwed up dodging once. The Morg Binding you use in your Example for me falls in this category actually: Yea, it can be doged and it can be blocked, but in the end of the day it does not offer you any chance to strike back at Morg if she wastes it - she still is 1000+range away and has her balck shield to save her from serious engaging attempts. So the Changes for her to screw up are way less than the changes for someone to finally get hit and then stay CC´d till doomsday. \nI think you really should reevaluate how impactfull you want to have such spamable long-range skills...and especially how much disengage potential you want to hand over to Champs that have such long-range abilities.\n- So as {{item:3222}} does not offer any Counterplay to anything his main function then somewhat seems to be to make Varus and Ashe (carries that realy on their initiating utility) unviable currently. I think the Game would actually be better off without that Item and your arguments sort of support this.\n- Alistars ~90% pick&ban-rate in worlds currently really suggests that Knockups/backs are really worse to play against than the likes of Stuns. E.g Irelia should be a natural counter to toplane Alistar, as she deals truedmg, has great sustain and is really resilent to CC - though well, turns out she´s not resilent to being knocked around and thus just cannot dare to face Alistar. I think Counterbuilding is still a large part of Counterplay in the long run, and right now you really undervalue the impact of Tenacity on Teamfights way too much...while hardcountering certain things with the likes of {{item:3140}} or die to it surely isn´t a healthy way to deal with things - soft countering CC by bringing the duration you have to live through down before you may impact the fight again really helps out a lot, especially on frontline Champions (though they seem to be fairly neglected anyway ever since S2 ended)","replies":[{"poster":"Raptamei","date":"2014-10-07T15:46:54.226+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":4,"body":"Zenon is utterly off base here.\n\nDota has few skillshots and tons of attacks that are either undodgeable or almost so (blink blackhole). The counterplay in Dota lies in counterbuilding, counterpicking, reflexes, and **most importantly** positioning so that the enemy can only use their abilities ineffectively.\n\nRiot sadly believes that counterplay can only occur after a play has been initiated, which is why the game is so *passive and snowbally* - doesn't matter if you set up a big play, the enemy gets a free chance to dodge it; doesn't matter if you do something awesome to come back from behind, the enemy (who you just outplayed, mind) gets another chance to turn it around on you.\n\nNot to mention removing counterpicks means even less variety. The reason why Dota has so much pick variety is because every pick is good in some strategy or as a counter to some strategy; League removes this, ensuring there is no reason not to just pick the best champions.","replies":[{"poster":"Dehorn","date":"2014-10-07T15:49:14.930+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"exactly.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SpooksWithNukes","date":"2014-10-07T17:14:54.951+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"you just blew my mind bro{{item:3455}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"KaWraith","date":"2014-10-07T17:28:32.469+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":4,"body":"TL;DR Riot is going to keep proclaiming that their bugs are features right up until the moment they finally fix them, never admitting that they knew they were wrong in the first place. They think we are too dumb to notice, and most people are too distracted to call them on it. Sadly they are probably right.\n\nRiot's positions on things rarely make sense. Until you realize they are usually a PR move of someone proclaiming \"That's not a bug, it's a feature!\"\nExamples:\n\"RNG is terrible and unfun\" (Riot on why why dodge was removed)\n\"RNG is interesting and fun on binary roles like ADC\" (Riot on why Crit chance makes ADCs more interesting/fun to play)\nAnd basically: \"Everything morello has ever said\"... seriously go look up anything he says, and evaluate it as an after the fact excuse for why whatever he decided was \"the right decision at the time\".\n\nRiot seems to want us to believe that 'counter play', means having superior positioning, not buying QSS... yet QSS exists (and got an  upgrade path instead of being removed). also, flash-ults exists (e.g.WW/ Annie/ Malz/mumu/galio/liss), which basically make positioning to counter them impossible... but if flash didn't exist, these champs would be fairly underpowered because they are too easy to avoid... so flash is necessary to provide counter-counterplay opportunities.

Riot doesn't have its own opinion, it's just the company hiring all these different designers with different views. In these official documents regarding upcoming pre-season changes you can be fairly certain that it IS Riot's \"official policy\" and actually decisions that the entire designer team is standing behind.\nBut all this chat on the forums is just an exchange of opinions and ideas - designers do not agree with each other on every single issue, so you might hear from Zenon that RNG can promote counterplay, whereas Xypherous will say \"nono, it needs to go!\"\n\nIf you want \"official\" statements, wait for them to come to you in the Dev-Blogs. Until then, it's just designers chatting about the ideas they have and things they want to test. \nAlso, as far as I know, ZenonTheStoic is a designer very close to the champion specifics, whereas Ghostcrawler and Morello are the \"shotcallers\" for the designer team. So if Zenon tells us his interpretation of counterplay, you should take it with a grain of salt, since his statement may differ from the response you'd get from Morello or Ghostcrawler.\n\nTL;DR: There is no \"Riot says\" unless it's in the form of official statements. These occasional responses by designers on the forums are just \"hey, I am just surfing the forums and trying to answer questions and sharing ideas to the best of my ability.

And in the end that´s what matters when we play the game.  If we think the game is better with altering things we can just reach out here and hope it´ll get enough attention from the right people/change the right minds to make it through into the game.

Currently, ranged champions possess this too... but it's not adding to their depth of decision-making; instead it just tends to add an even greater degree of safety without real thought (because the kneejerk reaction of a ranged champ to escape is generally regardless of cc, the ignoring of cc tends to be incidental rather than intentional, i.e. not an actual decision). Making this change would tone down the oppressive aspects of ranged champs with mobility while adding more depth to their own timing (having to decide when to escape in a way that *won't* be interrupted) while also adding more decisions to their aggressors (do I burn the cc up front to bind them in their more vulnerable current position after which they'll be able to use their escape in full, or do I wait and try to interrupt their escape, leaving them in a slightly less vulnerable position but without an escape to use after the cc expires, at the risk of missing my window altogether?)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Goumindong","date":"2014-10-08T22:24:39.264+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But so is every active ability for the most part.

Everything in LoL has counterplay in that there are things you can do, at some level, to counter it; this could be at the pick stage, itemization stage, split-second reaction stage or rotation stage. \n\n\nThe real question is at what level do you have to counter a particular thing and how strong is it i.e. how much does it force you into particular choices with particular expectations.\n\nSo, how does Zed have counterplay? He has counterplay at the pick stage (counter pick Kayle mid or taric support). Counterplay at the itemization stage (build armor or QSS). Split second reaction stage (dodge Q; but NB can't dodge R). Rotation stage (group).\n\nNow, in many games some of these options will be difficult or undesirable because of other champions that force you away from particular options for counterplay. Kayle might be a bad mid for your game, taric a bad support because lucian lane bully and you need a stronger early game support. Armor might not be viable because you are ADC or they have 2 Ap champions. Split second reaction always helps but to some degree dodging skillshots = luck and is dependent on ping. Rotation can be difficult to co-ordinate in Soloque or might be difficult because the champion is too strong a split-pusher to allow you to group.\n\nThe point is what riot calls \"counterplay\" is actually a collection of options left to you in the game to deal with that champion's abilities and cannot be reduced to \"skill shot you can dodge.\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"Best Shyvana AU","date":"2014-10-07T14:33:03.030+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Alistair is pick or ban in worlds purely because it's being played on a patch where he is able to punch while headbutting, which makes it hell to play up there.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ValyrianBlade","date":"2014-10-07T13:24:06.115+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"I think the whole \"tenacity doesn't affect knock backs/ups\" is just absurd.  There's no reason for it not to,  unless they wanted to have the option to make certain champions have more effective CC than others in this way against only certain other champions (those who have or build tenacity). \n\nOn the other topics of counterplay, just because something isn't defined as such doesn't mean it's good or bad for the game. While the things you mentioned don't open up a window where you can punish them so evidently (I would comment that when Morgana's snare is down is when your jungler should gank) there is the point that she has this as not only her core skill but her only real source of damage (as you can walk out of her w and her e is a shield,  and she'll have to flash+zhonya's to pull off a good ult most of the time. It seems reasonable to have such a low risk impactful skill when her kit is useless otherwise for the most part. If there's a problem with Morgana it's in that her kit revolves around a snare (which is why she's typically either very impactful or completely irrelevant). \n\nIn summary,  I hope not considering something counterplay doesn't exclude it from review or vice versa.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Marenjii","date":"2014-10-08T22:03:27.336+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sub-optimal?
