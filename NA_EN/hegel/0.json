I have a solid 70 fps and 43 ms for the first few minutes of the last two games I have played and yet after the first few minutes I cannot do anything. It appears that I have control, but the minions don't move and nothing works. Then after 30 seconds of this the attempting to reconnect screen appears and it reconnects, allows me to play for a second and the process starts over. Is there anything I could do?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-27T00:12:37.326+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It does sound like your network is having problems holding a stable connection, so it can't communicate what's happening in-game.

The log reader showed that I was suffering from packet loss. I had already followed as many of the steps as possible that were recommended with little improvement, still unplayable. Do you think this may be something that will pass with time?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-29T16:37:13.682+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the update!
