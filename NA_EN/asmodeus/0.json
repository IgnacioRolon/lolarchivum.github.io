It's weird how with my FPS capped at 60, my screen tears, even if i have good fps it feels like 20 fps . If i use \"Vsync\" in game it fix my problem and it's smooth enough  but i have input lag so i don't use  it.   Also i tried another monitor and i get same problem . \r\n\r\nAnyone can help me ?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-16T04:54:03.040+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is essentially how capped + VSYNC vs Uncapped + Zero Sync works. Vertical sync will *almost always* provide a more stable framerate since it's actually syncing every frame with your display. Since the card you're running is slowly becoming more dated (I still have a spare rig running a 750ti, I feel ya), you may start noticing that it will require different configurations in the Video settings as games are updated with fancier graphics and features. You may be experiencing this issue as a result of the Windows Game Bar, if it's enabled, so I'd recommend checking if this is the case by following [**this guide.**](http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8637-game-bar-turn-off-windows-10-a.html)\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[{"poster":"Asmodeus","date":"2016-12-16T13:32:58.931+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you think if i buy new Gpu will solve my issue ?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-18T21:39:52.710+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You *should* see a difference in your framerate, but I cannot guarantee that replacing your GPU will immediately resolve this issue entirely. You can maybe borrow a friend's GPU to swap in and try out, that way you don't have to shell out some cash to confirm whether or not the GPU is the culprit.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
