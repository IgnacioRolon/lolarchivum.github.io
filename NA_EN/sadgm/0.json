Per the [hextech crafting](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207884233-Hextech-Crafting-Guide) guide, you also need to own the champion.   One more requirement is that you need to have an available chest slot for the week, which will refresh once a week.  Meaning if you already got a handful of chests, you could be out of slots.  Let me know if you have any questions!","replies":[{"poster":"SadGM","date":"2017-03-17T18:24:32.243+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thanks for help, it was realy an issue with weekly slots for chest","replies":[]}]}]}
