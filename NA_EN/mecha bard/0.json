Can I have an answer on this instead of a game? :)","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] General Discussion","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"Just 2 short questions on Zac. If anyone wants to add their thoughts, please do so!\r\n\r\n1. What&#039;s your opinion on Zac right now? Balance, and otherwise. Good spot? Healthy? Needs buffs? Needs nerfs? Other than the small buff on his E, everyone been a bit quiet on my favorite champ.\r\n\r\n2. I know you guys are on a small kick of champion identity in the past year.  I think Zac is in a decent spot, but I wonder how you guys see him as his identity? What do you guys balance him around? Jungle? Top? \r\n\r\nOpinion: I see him as the champ trying to be the most disruptive thing on the battlefield, but people often complain about his Q being lackluster especially since most people level it last. See as most people build Rylai&#039;s on him, have you guys considered giving Zac&#039;s Q something similar to the knock aside effect on Draven&#039;s E in exchange for the slow? MAXIMUM DISRUPTION. (You also might see Zac support then. Which would be fun. :D )\r\n\r\nKeep up the good work. Have a nice holiday. :)\r\n\r\n....Bonus round! Which champ do you think needs the most thematic help, regardless of how good their kit is or how much they are loved? (My vote is Rammus.)","replies":[]}
