I never crash/freeze in game, but during champ select, going to the shard page, or at any given moment outside of playing the game my client crashes/freezes randomly. I need to go to task manager to close the client. Sometimes it happens when i choose new masteries, after I lock in, when I accept a queue AFK check, hit the shop button ANYTHING seems to trigger it, not anything in particular. I get multiple 5-30 min temp bans because of this and it's really starting to annoy me. I reinstalled the entire client and nothing.\n\n\n\nI run an Alienware x51 R2 with a NVIDIA Geforce GTX 745. My friend that plays with me has the exact same computer and his client never or almost never crashes.\n\nSometimes i get lucky and it'll crash/freeze when I lock in and all i do is wait for my friend to tell me when we're loading in so that i can exit the client and reload it then reconnect, avoiding the leaver buster penalty.\n\nI am posting this here because for some reason I'm only lvl 2 here and apparently lvl 2 on the boards prevents me from posting in \"report a bug section\" Despite having 3 lvl 30 accounts in game.\n\nAnywho, my 2-cents. help please.\n\nEdit: After I posted my lvl jumped to my in game account level. There's another bug for you. So that's fixed but I don't feel like making another thread so read on.","replies":[{"poster":"Velotix","date":"2016-07-27T22:58:27.962+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"One thing that really annoys me is that I lose LP everytime this happens during champ select.

I was playing on the same WIFI connection as my friend with the same computer, sitting next to him and my client still crashed but his didn't.\n\nYour answer would mean that I would get crashes during gameplay too, which I don't. being in game seems to be the most stable. If I were to put a timeline on this, I would say it started happening around 6.11 - 6.12. It never bothered me early on because I know the client isn't the most sound client in the world. But now it seems to happen every second game and these 30 min bans are frustrating, especially when it's totally out of my control.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-07-27T18:11:49.897+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"From your description, it sounds like your client is disconnecting from the platform service due to an unstable connection. When the client drops connection or experiences a poor connection to the servers, it can not only cause delays in what you see in champ select but can crash you to the desktop as well. The cause may be your network adapter, but the guide that *Rineyy* linked is a good place to start in troubleshooting this issue.\n\nIf you still see issues after taking the steps in that guide, please let me know.","replies":[{"poster":"Velotix","date":"2016-07-27T18:20:55.836+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It doesn't crash to desktop.

I understand what you are saying but at this point I honestly think it is something other than connection. But I will try the troubleshooting again.
