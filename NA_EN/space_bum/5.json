If you main a champion, you know the precise animation times for each ability. \r\nAllowing you to better react to situations. \r\n\r\nNo matter who, each champion has a few unfavorable match ups. You should off-main at least 1 champion that counters your Main's counters, for when you are picking into them. \"the enemy of my enemy is my friend\" though you would also not be wrong to stick with your main because your experience may outweigh the counter. \r\n\r\nChoosing a main is simple. Go to the website op.gg, look at your win rates across all modes. You should probably be maining your highest win rate champion, given the\r\npercentage is based on a decent number of games.","replies":[{"poster":"Tsugaga","date":"2015-02-28T15:48:56.314+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I disagree with maining your highest win rate champ, that doesn't always mean that the player played that champ well.

I would just think that if they had played them enough times to meet my criteria. It's likely they enjoy playing them and they have a much shorter bridge to become a great \"blank\"  main.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"admiralcourvoisi","date":"2015-03-03T03:47:27.037+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Especially in unranked/low elo, it's better to play someone you're comfortable with and know how to play than the \"correct\" counterpick. You'll feel more confident and be in a better mindset to make important plays than if you're playing a counter who you aren't familiar  with.","replies":[]},{"poster":"FedAsFuk","date":"2015-02-28T21:40:44.044+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Personal example, I am a riven one trick pony with 2 accounts currently in s1/g5 and this ugly stepchild of an account, anyways I get \"counterpicked\" very often especially on this account with someone picking Garen, but because of my familiarity with the matchup I come out far ahead and have a much higher impact in the game than my opposition. \n\nMoral of the story you are better playing something you are comfortable with than being concerned over a matchup. You will win more lanes, snowball more and know how to use your snowball on a champ you are comfortable with.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rikari","date":"2015-02-28T17:09:35.777+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Countering is not for low ELO,  99% of the time. \n\nThis.\nPlease.\n**Bronzies,Please don't pick Caitlyn into Jinx.Please.**\n{{champion:23}} {{champion:114}} {{champion:17}} {{champion:122}} {{champion:86}}  does not counter my (S4 Main) {{champion:39}}  you *Bronzies.*","replies":[{"poster":"Space Bum","date":"2015-02-28T17:29:35.278+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I ban Irelia every time I'm first pick....
