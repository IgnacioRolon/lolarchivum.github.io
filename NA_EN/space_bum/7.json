Which could explain the amount of deaths increasing as they learn the timing and inner intimate details of the champion, because not a full time as some people might be stuck on \"gosh they suck beyond excrement\" level of ability; which is maybe much of what I receive when Championing {{champion:16}}  and throwing myself into the fray for my teammates to witness the combinations of my death the enemy bots are throwing at us, or to help save their lives.\n\nI used to help protect my older brother, Warrior in the Gauntlet in the arcade. So way too many death decoy strategies and tactics have been made inside of my mind {to help him beat the game with spending less of his money, while I would spend more of my money. Which I know my mind is already amplified in some intellectual discussions while needing to learn video gaming killing in deaths to other game characters skills abilities; because I spent my time in sports growing up more than with other versions of video games after Atari.\n\nPlease, excuse me when I Champion with {{champion:16}}. I witnessed her ability if items are correct to slay the Legendary Dragon. When I Champion {{champion:16}}  I observe some of the animal characteristics and maybe that is a baseline thought as to why with {{champion:16}}  I never slay the Legendary Dragon. Though I will team tandem and heal or help others to slay the Legendary Dragon. I am not a last striker after another Champion has made all of the time and homework to slay the monsters. However, with {{champion:131}} I can Slay the Legendary Dragon solo at times, and a feat which took me some confidence to find. There is less of an encounter with confidence gaining experiences when a person never tries at all; a valuable lesson in video gaming I have finally experienced and learned because my older brother is not around to defeat the Bosses of Larger Animal Monsters.\n\nMy bottom-line when Championing with {{champion:16}} is that I am a healer through and through for lane teammates and my team. I will flank long to other lanes to share my {{summoner:7}}   and my {{summoner:13}} = mana/ boosts which, (mana) I normally carry when Championing {{champion:16}}. Which is another important item many magical characters are without in their arsenals when they would rather carry other boosts.

That's why I prefer damagey AP champions like Lulu or Sona as opposed to full utility champs like Leona that require a follow up. Hell, I can make plays better with Blitzcrank because he doesn't depend on his teammates to follow through.\n\nGenerally speaking, when I play {{champion:89}} , I often won't engage directly on enemy squishies if I'm the one that has to initiate the teamfight. Her CC just doesn't last long enough to really secure kills on enemy priority targets unless your team has very specific champions. What I will often do instead is initiate on the enemy front line and get my team to focus on them, and then save my ult for if the enemy carries get too brave while we're fighting their frontline. And if you have to tank the enemy carries for a while to do this? So be it; you bought all those tank items for a reason, after all.\n\nPeople tend to think that it's always best to initiate on enemy squishies, but I find this is only true if you have the firepower and swiftness needed to kill or force them out of the fight before the enemy team can really respond. Obviously, if the enemy adc is massively out of position, feel free to just shit on them. But in general, I find it more effective to take the fight to the enemy front line first and then slowly work your way forward to the enemy back line. This is especially true if the enemy has a very strong peeling presence like a {{champion:40}} and a {{champion:90}} . You simply aren't going to be able to dive and kill that enemy adc, so stop trying. The enemy adc's dont have that long of range, and Janna can only really do her job if your team tunnels on diving her adc.

As a comparison, let's look at hers and Nami's ults.\n\nI would argue that Nami's ult is a much stronger counterengage because its a very wide projectile that moves in a long line, and knocks people up as well as slowing them after. It's pretty easy to juke a Leona ult if you have a mobility spell. The only person that can consistently deal with Nami's ult, when used as a counter engage, is {{champion:157}}. Leona's Ult is definitely a much stronger offensive ability though, but it has the tradeoff of being less than optimal when used defensively, since Leona's ult is usually best as a follow up to other hard CC. Nami's is the opposite, since it is slow moving and has a decent cast time, but neither of these factors matter nearly as much when used defensively rather than aggressively.","replies":[{"poster":"SpecterVonBaren","date":"2015-02-24T20:51:56.913+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Very true. My only real issue with Leona's ult is just the short cooldown it has. If a Leona uses her ult in lane and it results in her ADC getting a kill or double kill then by the time both them and the enemy laners have come back from base, her ult is almost ready to go again.
