I load into the game and am unable to use my ability keybinds (QWERBF).  It can happen on my first game after loading or the 5th game.  There is no way to duplicate when it happens but it continues to happen nonetheless.  When it does occur I ctrl+alt+del for task manager and sometimes that fixes it in game, but other times it does not.\r\n\r\nCan someone please fix this issue?","replies":[{"poster":"Kałe","date":"2017-11-22T00:30:20.336+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I basically have the same problem, I've had this issues for several months now. However I cant ctrl+alt+del to task manager, I have to completely exit the game and client and then load back in.
