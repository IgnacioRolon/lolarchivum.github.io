I would agree with them if the person was racist or sexist or the equivalent of that. But no on in this entire game should ever be punished EVER for something petty.

The summoner's code says \"**Don't Rage, Blame, or tear others down**\". You do all three a whole lot. It also says \"**Play as a team, win as a team**\" which you obviously break when you say you say things like \" i refuse to be your tank\" and \" im fucking done with awfu teams\".

Can you not see your own chatlog completely?\n\nSure, *technically* you got banned for saying 'you suck', but there was also other stuff. You weren't banned for *only* saying 'you suck'. You were constantly being negative and a prick. \n\nJust because something is true, doesn't mean you aren't toxic when pointing it out. The players you are playing with are just as frustrated as you are that they couldn't complete their goal, but you are choosing to rub it in. The irony of it being that you seem incapable of figuring that everyone has bad games. \n\n> dstruck71: dont play jungle ever again\" (if you suck at jungle sk for someone else to take the role dont bring your whole team down cause you are bad at it.)\n\nYou had a game where you went 2/9/1 as Mundo, then played another game and went 1/5/0, but yet you still played another game after that. Meaning, you just went against your own logic. \n\nAnd yes it's technically true that if you aren't good at something, it's more logical from a game-winning point of view, to have someone better do it. But this is a video game. We ultimately should play to entertain ourselves. \n\n---\n\n> \"dstruck71: fuck this thanks for checking ez\ndstruck71: keep sittin there\ndstruck71: report ez\ndstruck71: fucking troll\ndstruck71: im reporting you ez (so hes allowed to sit there while his team literally next to him fights a 4v 5 and costs us the game ultimately because of them snowballing off that and i shouldnt tell him im rporting him or that he is a troll which he is? None of that was toxic harrsamnet or gaainst tos)\n\nIt absolutely *is* against the TOS to use the report tool as a weapon against other players. You're threathening him into playing as you want him to. It's not the worst, but it's still mildly toxic.\n\n> dstruck71: ez never speak\n\nOr just mute him.\n\n> dstruck71: if we lose its mainly you\" (i wasnt wrong and was correct this is called a presumption and i was again right about it and not against toss.

You don't get to decide what other players do. It's alright to have strategic disagreements, but you're being waaay to agressive about it. Mildly toxic.\n\n> dstruck71: stop being a bad jungle (nothing wrong with calling someone a bad jungle)\n\nDebateable. It's not the worst, no one is going to crythemselves to sleep over it. But you're still just disrupting the game to bring in negativity. You're objectively making the game harder to win by tilting and fighting with teammates. So yes, there IS something wrong with calling others bad. At the very best, mildly toxic.\n\n> dstruck71: if you dont get dragon im leving (i agree you shouldnt say this but i was mad i didnt leave by the way)\n\nBeing mad isn't really a good excuse, but you didn't argue so anyways. I'm just including it for the completeness.\n\n> dstruck71: im done i will never leave top (i dont have to ever leave top no rule says i have to teamfight)\ndstruck71: no matter what (see above)\ndstruck71: i refuse to be your tank (see above)\ndstruck71: im fucking done with awfu teams (this is wrong to say i got frustrated and said something \n\nSure, no rule says that you HAVE to teamfight. Also no rule said that you were the leader of the team. Or that that you HAVE to get dragon. \n\nAnd you're even opening another can of worms. Since you KNOW it's objectively worse to abandon your team, and to not build tank, wouldn't that mean that you are intentionally trying to lose? Thus making it against the rules? I mean, you aren't going top and not building tank because you think it's the superior choice.\n\nI am going to say that it is against the rules to make bad decisions out of spite for your team.\n\n> dstruck71: cause you SUCK\ndstruck71: sick of getting teams like you\ndstruck71: dont play jungle ever again\" (if you suck at jungle sk for someone else to take the role dont bring your whole team down cause you are bad at it.)\n\nAgain, at best mildly toxic, at worst just plain toxic.\n\n---\n\nMost of the things you said were mildly toxic. But they build up. When you're mildly toxic over multiple games, it will lead to a punishment.\n\n> warrants perma bans or any punishment in this game.\n\nNo one here thinks that this alone warrants you a permaban. What we think warrants a permaban is this COMBINED with whatever  your previous offences has been. You don't get permabanned for toxicity as the first punishment. You have at the very least 1 more chance. Most cases you get 2-3 chances. If you waste those chances, then you are showing yourself incapable of reforming.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Primaquarius","date":"2018-10-16T19:38:54.176+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its not about hurt feelings, we just want the negativity off our screen when we're trying to play a VIDEO GAME.
