I recently saw this.\r\n\r\nhttp://na.lolesports.com/tickets-are-now-on-sale\r\n\r\nFor this event they said they are giving out Ahri Challenger Skin on the @lolesports twitter, but I live in Philly and that is all the way in LA. I will most likely never be able to attend one of these events. Anyways I was wondering if League would be kind enough to bring back challenger ahri for two weeks for the people that never got a chance to get her months ago. I really want this skin (the champ I play the most). I also have seen a lot of people asking for league to bring this skin back for months. Ahri is my favorite champ and I love being her, would be even better with the skin though. Like I said I know you guys had a limited edition Ahri last year, but was wondering if you could bring it back this year for a couple weeks like you did a while ago. Would only be fair for the people that really never got a chance to get her a while back or don&#039;t live in LA to go an actual event. Thanks for reading this if anyone from the League administration looks at this.\r\n\r\nSincerely, a huge Ahri fan\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPS: I was told to post this on this section by RiotSupport so a staff member would look at this","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-05-04T16:47:20.983+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Hiya Contributed!\n\nChallenger Ahri is a legacy skin, which means she can (and likely) will return to the store - be sure to keep and eye out. :]","replies":[{"poster":"Charm Of Fate","date":"2015-05-04T16:51:01.411+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Thanks for replying means a lot.

As they're not given to challenger players, bronze scrubs can purchase them too. It's just a regular legacy skin, like the Championship skins.\n\nExcept for the fact that the Championship skins celebrate the end of the season, whilst the Challenger skins celebrate the start of a new season.\n\nAlso, I hated Challenged Ahri.\n\nMaybe it's just because Ahri, who's already a total bitch becomes even derpy with that skin ...","replies":[{"poster":"Tendrian","date":"2015-05-04T23:31:01.209+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"He knows its not for challenger players.
