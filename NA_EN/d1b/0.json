Sometimes when you hold it down it attaches but doesn't bring you behind them, I don't know how to replicate it and it only happens maybe less than 1 in 20 matches, but is this something that you know about/can fix?","replies":[]},{"poster":"d1b","date":"2017-09-06T06:21:39.489+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"Thanks for a quick response. Honestly, I'm not convinced to this solution. It's kinda weird that he can lock on a champion and dash trough the walls or forest... but anyway, it's not my decision how this should work.
