I've been playing on this resolution since season 3 . I entered a game today and it was saying ' No optimum mode,Recomanded : 1360/768' I've left the game,went to config and changed it to 800/600;nothing happened. Then changed it to 1024/768;nothing happened,then changed it on 1360/768;nothing happened. I even changed the resolution on my 'screen resolution' on desktop to all kinds of resolutions,nothing happened,same thing was happening. Then i joined the game,pressed alt+enter,thing which led me to windowed mode,i could see the game. Pressed restore to defaults,then fullscreen mode;same thing was happing. Pressed alt enter again and choose 1360/768 and after that 1024/768(which is the lowest resolution there is) but it still didn't work. I really wanna hear a fix for this because that is not in my power,this patch did it,and i'll probably get a low priority queue because of that.\n\nThanks.\n\nforgot to mention: i've tried to play on both clients,the new one and the legacy one,still not working.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-12T18:16:20.251+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Some players are currently experiencing issues in full screen, and updates are being provided on the [service status](http://status.leagueoflegends.com/#na) page.

From there you can change back to your old monitor and play for about a week before this happens again. The problem is after that week is over you gotta get a new monitor since the old one won't fix the problem again idk why bb jesus let me play lol{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}} \n\n\nI love how riot refuses to concentrate on fixing this problem which stops many players from playing.\nI now have about 20 low priority games because of this problem.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gromie iz back","date":"2017-07-12T20:19:13.036+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{summoner:7}} {{champion:22}} was everything fine till the new patch, i cant play league cus i get BLACKSCREEN after every champion select ...1/10 occasions game starts normaly ..\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"Xhaply","date":"2017-06-07T10:55:34.826+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same is happening to me, at this new patch 7.11","replies":[]}]}
