But the thing is we do special 1v1s where we go on ARAM and do all random champions and can't dodge so no one picks OP champions. Later after we finished I tried the practice tool and it chose it randomly. Yesterday, I went into a custom game and started it with all random, backed out and tried the practice tool again and it chose a random champion for me again. But when I restarted my client it worked properly.","replies":[]}]}]}
