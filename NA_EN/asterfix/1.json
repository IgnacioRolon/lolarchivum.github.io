Got 3 on Xayah, no chest. Got 3 more on other champs I never play and nothing. The games where I actually did earn a chest were mostly my duo getting an S. I haven't received ANY in the past couple months either. The last time I got one was in january.\r\n\r\n So what the hell? Why am I never getting one? I've got Keys, 4 keys (12 games with an S rank on my team). Not a single chest.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-02T22:45:10.304+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I looked into this for you, and it looks like you already got a chest for Xayah a while back.  More specifically, on April 19th in a ranked game where you went 12/1/7.  You can only obtain a mastery chance once on that champion, per the [hextech crafting](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207884233-Hextech-Crafting-Guide) guide.  Let me know if that clears things up! ","replies":[]}]}
