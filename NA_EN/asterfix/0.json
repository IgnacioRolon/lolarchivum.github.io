It isn't bad and I don't usually have a whole ton of machines suckling the wifi. Now that that's out of the way Holy Shit do my lobbies fuck up. Had a lobby where i locked in a champ, the timer ticked all the way down and i was booted for refusing to pick a champion. My last lobby I had my champ picked, we were onto the next set of people picking and I was checking to see what items I should buy on mobafire when my League icon was flashing, after I clicked it a message saying I refused to pick a champion. I now have a 30 minute queue I gotta wait through for this BullShit. I know it ain't on my end because when it is on my end I can't physically click on the lock in button and I have to sit there for fuckin' 30 seconds while the game decides whether or not i should be booted out of the lobby for actually no reason. My computer is connected to the ethernet cable, my modem is right next to my computer and i am given alerts whenever i lose internet access. \r\n\r\nSo WTF riot? take off these stupidass queue dodge times from your shitty client booting me out of game for no reason.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2018-01-03T19:07:34.113+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like your Wifi is degrading pretty poorly, and causing you to lose sync in champion select.  This may be rather silly, but are you sure that your network is set to Ethernet?  I know personally, I've accidentally had Wifi enabled even though the ethernet was connected.\n\nOtherwise, see if your router may need a[ power cycle](https://kb.netgear.com/19755/How-to-Power-Cycle-Your-Home-Network?cid=wmt_netgear_organic) to help resolve the degradation.","replies":[{"poster":"lawnninja555","date":"2018-01-04T03:48:48.003+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have same problem + more.  when they rolled out the patch #.B.

It's very frustrating. I have used the repair tool, I have used the ''report a bug'' tool in the client, I have written here before, idk what to do anymore.","replies":[]}]}
