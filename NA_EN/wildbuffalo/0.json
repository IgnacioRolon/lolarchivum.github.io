Zed{{champion:238}}  is a known Rival to Shen{{champion:98}}  in the league lore. Prediction: They kill zed off and disable him for a certain time, shen gets his rework, skins come out for the new assassin item patch, zed comes back with an ultimate skin!!!

Many have speculated that DeadEye is a new champion, a marksman, probably named Jhin (name that appears in the files) because we can hear a gun shot in Zed's teaser (which has nothing to do with Shen's identity).
