My friend introduced me to her a few weeks ago right after the Dragon Blade Riven skin went off the market and as I play Riven more I wish I had known about her before and would have gotten that skin. Is there any chance that those kind of skins might come back for a brief time.","replies":[{"poster":"MrPerson10","date":"2015-03-18T23:16:44.850+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"They bring them back once in a while, they're called Legacy skins.
