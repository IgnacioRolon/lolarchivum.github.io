Like, being able to buy champion themed voices for the announcer, kind of like what Smite does.\n\nIf im playing Noctunre and i buy the Noc voice pack, the announcer turns to nocturne. So Nocturne announces so long as im playing him. Each champ has his own announcer purchasable voice.\n\nIt would also be a great opportunity to add more Announcer lines, cuz god knows there are too few.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MugenNightmare","date":"2014-10-12T11:52:11.376+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't know, I like the current announcer.
