Every time I get in a game my League starts off as windowed, window/resolution is painfully small, FPS is randomly locked at 25, and the settings are the lowest. Consequently, I have to readjust my settings every time I enter a game. I reinstall League but I still get the issue. Any advice?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-13T17:31:57.952+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This could be due to a few reasons like outdated drivers, or corrupt configuration files that are failing to save or load properly.
