I'll pick them if I think they fit nicely with our team and against theirs. I also don't want to be \"forced\" to play Sona because I showed her but they just picked a bot lane I don't want to pick her into and have 4 people yell \"wtf\" when I opt for someone else because the match up doesn't work.","replies":[{"poster":"Z Statistic","date":"2016-01-16T17:33:44.558+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"\"We were honestly fine building the pyramids without wheels.
