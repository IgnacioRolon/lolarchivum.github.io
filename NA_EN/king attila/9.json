I honestly didn't think I'd win 3 in a row after those debacles.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ValyrianBlade","date":"2016-06-20T00:59:54.461+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I've seen a plethora of posts asking for various ways of fixing this (some of which have been legitimately good ideas) and it's a shame it hasn't happened.\n\nWhen trolls are lurking and people are dodging, and you're unable to dodge, it is inevitable that you will eventually be hit with the troll. Being completely unable to dodge seems unfair. Even if it's a charge system that takes a while to get to, being able to dodge while in promos would make a huge difference.\n\nAnyways, my 2 cents with an upvote. At least there are now the free-wins at low elo's if you lose a series and get back to it, those likely more than outweigh the inability to dodge. Not sure how many issues there are in plat+ though (I see like nothing in games with mostly gold 3 ish players).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Glîtchy","date":"2016-06-20T00:51:42.869+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"It is pretty unfair, cause during my first series from Bronze 5 to Bronze 4, I needed 1 win JUST 1, but then my team was a 4 man premade and went\n\nThresh top, Bard adc, Soraka jg, and Braum support.\n\nI vote we have it dodging twice during a series counts as 1 loss.","replies":[{"poster":"Hibeki","date":"2016-06-20T04:39:58.531+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"you have a lot more problems if you are stuck in bronze v","replies":[{"poster":"Glîtchy","date":"2016-06-20T14:47:55.906+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Hebiki,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=wzaOEMkV,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2016-06-20T04:39:58.531+0000)\n>\n> you have a lot more problems if you are stuck in bronze v\n\nI'm Bronze 2 presently, the problem isn't how I'm playing but it's the bans people are making,\n\nMy team actually banned, {{champion:6}} and {{champion:83}} once so I had to choose between Fizz or Zed, so that game was not on me, my team typically just chooses whatever beat them in lane in the last game.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Hi lm Negan","date":"2016-06-20T12:52:07.633+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"You are gold 5 since three seasons.
