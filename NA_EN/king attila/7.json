She isn&#039;t a good pick anywhere.   Not support nor Mid.

She has a handful of really abusive mid matchups still, and she's still good at peeling some of the heavy all-in supports.  However, you are right that with a kit like hers she's getting slowly left behind.","replies":[]},{"poster":"jjookkeerr","date":"2015-07-22T11:12:46.337+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thanks the mobility powercreep","replies":[]},{"poster":"Attysu The Poro","date":"2015-07-22T08:00:02.985+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I haven't played Morg in awhile, I'll test it out in 5.14 to see whats up with it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"InsaneSamurai","date":"2015-07-22T07:36:28.105+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, maybe a little, but she won't really fall off until they nerf her Q, which will likely be never :P\n\nAlthough there's also the chance that everyone eventually has a dash of some sort which could also make her pretty sad.","replies":[]}]}
