I read two of them, one about the founding of the Argent Crusade and one about the origin of the Gilnean Worgen curse.  They had good art, decent writing, and told a lot about the behind-the-scenes of the world.  To those that read them, they were a great source of information and entertainment, and they also did a lot of world-building.  I don't play WoW anymore, but I'm pretty sure I still have those comics.  \n\nIf Riot were to make comics -or even write books- about Valoran and the champions in it, I'm positive there would be a big market for them.  Comics are really popular right now, and seeing League of Legends comics might actually pull more people into the game.  Example:  A person goes to their favourite comic shop to pick up the new Thor or Ultimate Avengers or Saga comic, and they see a comic for League of Legends on the 'new arrivals' shelf.  The person has never played League, but has heard of it.  The comic's art looks cool so they pick it up and start reading it.  They like the story and even though they decide not to buy the comic right away, when they go home they'll download the game and check it out.  They decide that if they like it, they'll go back and buy the comic.  \n\nBut Riot, if you *do* decide to do any print-format stories for League of Legends, I have but one small request...  Please have at least one arc/story about Viktor and the Glorious Evolution.  Thank you.  ^_^  \n\nEDIT:  Oooohh...  Accidentally made this into a wall of Text.  Tl;dr:  Comics = good.  League comics = good + more $$ for Riot.  ","replies":[{"poster":"RiotJaredan","date":"2015-03-09T05:47:52.627+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm not averse to a good wall of text.

Lore books would also help you establish lots of sideline lore about any skin line there is, which, let's admit it, would be fascinating.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RasCaelestis","date":"2015-03-09T09:36:37.415+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's awesome!  Whether it's books or comics or even newspaper-style articles like the old Journal of Justice, any sort of supplemental lore would be great.  I can't deny that the newer style of lore (Bard: Mountain and the Jinx and Amumu music videos, etc.) is cool, but there's a lot that it leaves open to interpretation.  That can be good, but it seems like it's all we've been getting recently.  Vague bits of \"it's up to the viewer to determine what happens\" can be really interesting, but that kind of storytelling can only be done if a solid foundation is already set up.  The ret-con took a lot of that foundation away, and so far we've not had much to fill in the gaps.  \n\nI don't intend to come across as rude or whiny, but it's been months since the short-form champion biographies were added to the client and website.  We were told that longer and more detailed versions were coming (albeit only to the website), but so far there has been no change.  I understand that technical limitations exist, but how long does it take to fix these sorts of problems?  \n\nIt seems like the vast majority of people on the boards would like more information, even if it was just text-based stories posted to the website every so often.  I admit, I started playing after the JoJ was discontinued, but one day I found them through the client and spent more time than I'd care to admit reading through all of them.  The stories were a bit silly at times, but they were balanced out well by the more serious bits.  It was a great way for players to learn more about the champions they liked.  The same can be said about champion Judgements too.  I know that the JoJ and Judgements are no longer possible due to the Institute of War and the League itself being removed from the canon, but it's not beyond the realm of possibilities for another similar thing to be added.  Small snippets of what champions are doing when they're not on Summoner's Rift would be a great way for fans to learn more about the world of Runeterra and its inhabitants.  \n\nGoing back to the original comics idea...  I'm pretty sure that not many newer fans know that some champion previews were announced with short one-page comics.  I'll link my favorites, Viktor's and Nautilus's, as examples.  The (sadly defunct) game Dawngate had a similar tri-weekly comic called *The Dawngate Chronicles* that gave a lot of backstory to the world and the Shapers.  Unfortunately, EA pulled the plug on Dawngate before it had a chance to become popular, but it did an incredible amount of world-building and storytelling in the short time it was playable.  I'm not saying League of Legends should copy it 100%, but it's a fantastic example of how to do storytelling for a MOBA.  \n\nI'll end this by saying that I really do like the work you guys do, but it seems like ever since the removal of the Institute of War and the Summoners and the League itself, the actual lore that we've gotten has decreased greatly in quantity.  The production quality is amazing, but the substance of it seems to be lacking a lot of what the older material had.  We'll continue to support the Lore team, but the allure and promise of \"More Lore Coming Soon!\" can only last for so long.  \n\nEDIT AGAIN:  I did not realize this, but there apparently can only be one attachment per post.  Here's a link to [the Nautilus comic](http://img4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20120209115547/leagueoflegends/images/a/a7/Nautilus_Comic.jpg) I mentioned.

The JoJ was written like a newspaper, not a novel. There were stories told, and they did fill in the lore gap on a basic level, but they were all stories that had already happened, and were just being reported on or recounted. That's not something I want to read as my only source of lore for any given world.\n\nIf Riot had hired professional authors to write novels or novellas or short stories (or a collection of short stories?) that took place within Runeterra, from the points of view of actual Champions themselves, THAT would be much more exciting to read. To engage me by having a much more personal story, one right alongside my favorite Champion as they're going on some kind of adventure.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with Journal or Newspaper entries mind you. One of the best lore entries Riot has ever made (imo), Quinn's journal during the Freljord event, was in the form of a journal, but it was *Quinn's* journal. Everything was being told from *her* point of view as *she* was experiencing it, and that was exciting to me. However, as much as I enjoyed that, I would not want every story to be told exactly like that. Journal entries are great for getting a very personal account from the in-world writer, as they're best used as a window into their mind, but that author may not be the best at describing the beautiful landscapes, nor would they necessarily want to describe a fight scene they had just moments before writing it down (unless they loved fighting I guess). To get those kinds of descriptions you'd either have to have a very different journal author, or you'd have to have a story told in another fashion.\n\nWhich, as it so happens, Riot has actually been doing quite well since the Freljord event. They haven't been doing a good job at getting a lot of them out at a frequent enough pace to satisfy everyone, but I think the quality of their stories they HAVE been able to get out have been pretty good overall, especially compared to the original JoJ.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KING ATTILA","date":"2015-03-08T16:20:38.188+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"JoJ was ok, but I'm talking bigger and better!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SpecterVonBaren","date":"2015-03-09T05:50:32.220+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd even be satisfied with childrens books. \n\nWatch Sion.
