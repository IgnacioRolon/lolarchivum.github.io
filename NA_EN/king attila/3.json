Image there are math equations that seems relatively simple at first something such as 1+(x)=3,  2+(x)=3, 4-(x)=3. They seem simple right? But in league those questions are something along the line of 175 x 12(X3%)-(abcdefghijklmnop)=275. Now create around 100 of those equations all in different forms, factor in every single possible missing variable for each, Have someone yell in your ear that you are unable to do math correctly the entire time. And then ask what balance.","replies":[]}]}
