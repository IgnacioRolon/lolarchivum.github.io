(I think?) and I uninstalled it, but was wanting to reinstall it. However, I am getting 300 kbps MAX when my normal download speed is 12-16 mbps. I've tested other downloads, and it is only slower when downloading the pbe, and drastically slower. Anyone else having problems/know a fix or even a cause like maybe severs are under stress or something? Just wanting to know at least WHY it's so slow","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-13T03:09:15.626+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is happening mostly due to how many people are currently downloading the client most likely. The page itself has taken a hit from how many players were trying to access it at the same time, and the download servers are likely having the same issues.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ZeahRenee","date":"2017-10-13T00:15:34.876+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're not the only one having issues.
