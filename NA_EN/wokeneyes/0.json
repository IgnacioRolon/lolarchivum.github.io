Not just for me, but for people who's new to this game. I think what we need is a section for ''Smurfs'' players and for new ones and readjust the matchmaking. \nI'm not that good, I know when you smurfing you should be matched with higher players since you know how the game works, but there's a limit.\n\nEx: I got a game when I was level 9 and matched up against 2 platinum players and others with keystones. How is that suppose to be fair play? XD\nOr another one, we were bot (level 10, no keystone) VS 2 keystone players (so it's 10+ level difference). We got so much raped we coudn't even stay under our turret...\n\nSo, all I ask is that you readjust the matchmaking and if you can, create a section for smurfs and another one for newcomers.\n\nPS: Sorry if my English is bad XD\nWokeneyes :)","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-02T00:42:34.007+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since you aren't level 30 yet you must be playing normals, which only takes your average MMR into account. Essentially, the match will find 10 people and then do it's best to sort you between teams so that the team's total MMR is relatively close to the others. At the end, you should end up with mostly balanced teams. If you only want to play with those close to your skill level and a competitive mindset, I'd suggest playing your main in ranked or waiting until this smurf can play ranked.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Flahles","date":"2017-10-01T17:14:21.279+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm pretty sure they already do this. They can tell in very early levels on new accounts if somebody is a smurf. Then they tend to put you with other smurfs. Just play it out. It's not like wins matter in normal games lol","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wokeneyes","date":"2017-10-03T12:33:41.146+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the fast reply! My MMR most be really good if I'm matched up with platinum and even diamond players :D\nSo, I will just play until reaching level 30 and go rank for setting my ELO.","replies":[]}]}
