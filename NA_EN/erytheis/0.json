Because if that's the case there is seriously something wrong with your system and it's pretty much condemning my account to a state of mediocrity if I ever choose to play for.. fun?\r\n\r\nI'd like a solution for this if possible please, something that doesn't involve me having to grind out as many matches as I did on my previous server just so I can normalize my current mmr and play vs people of equal skill, it feels unfair that because I've transferred just so I could play on better ping and now I'm in a situation where I can comeback with an account I've built over the years it's basically saying I'm not allowed to raise my normal mmr due to my previous time on another server.\r\n\r\nThankyou for any help or a possible solution in advance.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-16T04:03:37.276+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"MMR is **unique** to each region, so transferring to NA from OCE after spending many years there is going to be pretty different in terms of MMR. We cannot change your MMR, but if you continue to play the same and *grind* (as you mentioned) your MMR should normalize with consistent wins and good performance. I'd also keep in mind that third-party sites cannot access your true MMR, so take the numbers they list with a grain of salt.\n\nI'm certainly no expert when it comes to this topic, though, so you may want to post on the [Gameplay Boards](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance) for additional context and advice from other players.","replies":[]}]}
