I got disconnected and gave up for the afternoon hoping whatever the issue was would be resolved by evening. I log back in and start a game to find that I got the 5 minute penalty for leaving a game which I found annoying seeing as how I didn't just decide to leave it was due to technical issues, but whatever, a 5 minute wait no big deal.\r\n\r\nMy issue now is that this was a solid couple weeks ago and whenever I finish a game now I keep getting a message saying that because I left the game or went afk I am being placed in a lower priority queue.\r\n\r\nI try to go to support to ask them about it and have been greeted with this for the past 15 minutes.
