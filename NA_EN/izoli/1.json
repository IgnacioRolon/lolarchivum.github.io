After waiting what I thought was more than enough time I reset client, by the time I got back in I log into the end of game screen with everyone leaving and a message calling me a leaver.\r\n\r\nSecond game I switch hotspots while in champ select and wait for it to reconnect, after everything else connected it still wouldn't reconnect. So I tried to restart client but it kept not loading and eventually I found that there were like 3 instances running in task manager and once I exited out of them I got it to load up. By then, I got hit with another leave and along with it a leavebuster queue.\r\n\r\nThese are your problems and I got punished because of them, so I would sincerely like to say fuck you guys. I won't sit here and be treated like a problem when the problem wasn't me. If your system can't reconnect someone in matchmaking then don't try to make it a function. If it the loading screen fails to load for some reason give a damn error indicating that something went wrong.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-05T21:12:22.663+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry that these incidents caused you to accrue a leaverbuster.  :(  Our systems certainly want to get you in game, but it sounds like your network is having a lot of struggle reaching the game server.  For example, the black screen you see indicates a failure to download assets or get you in-game.  When you have some time, run through our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to help readjust your settings and clear up any blocks reaching the game server.  I highly recommend doing this in custom games for now to prevent anymore penalties.","replies":[]}]}
