It's a more defensive based buy, like {{item:3191}} , so it SHOULD feel like it makes an assassin's life harder. But you sacrifice damage to build it rather than damage based items. You also sacrifice versatility, since hex drinker and seekers armguard build only have a single buildpath (with the exception of moonflair spellblade in 3's)\n\nI also disagree that akali and diana are \"all-in\" with no out. Akali's shroud and ult make perfectly fine escape tools. Diana, if built like an assassin, is also able to escape too. Once she finds an opening and manages to land a Q, she can ult in, kill her target **without** using her refreshed R, and instead use that second ult as an escape.","replies":[{"poster":"HP Crookshanks","date":"2018-03-28T12:55:47.536+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{item:3155}} and {{item:3191}} are not comparable.

Sure, it makes you safer. That's the whole point of buying it. But it comes with sacrifices to A) damage B) item versatility and C) your power spike from your first big item. And you can certainly still die with it. Plenty of ad midlaners completely forgo hexdrinker cause they want that kill potential from an early lethality item.\n\n{{item:3191}}  definitely not weak lmao. It doesnt give you a shield from physical dmg like hex, but the the passive provides a pretty great chunk of stats ontop of it's already devent base stats. It's a very gold efficient item, with plenty of armor to make you safer from ad mids/jungles. I don't see the mana problems argument either. Rushing a mana item isn't necessary or even recommended on most ap mids. You could try to make the same argument against hex drinker leaving an ad mid without lifesteal anyways.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"HP Crookshanks","date":"2018-03-28T11:41:22.386+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{item:3155}} is too strong against every AP champions.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"HP Crookshanks","date":"2018-03-28T11:01:00.129+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree AP champions need more love.

In my opinion, they're in a pretty great spot.  The ap assassins might not always feel up-to-snuff because of items. With the introduction of lethality, ad assassins can hit their power spikes a lot faster than ap assassins can. The trade off is that ap assassins tend to scale muchhhh better into the late game. \nDiana is doing pretty fine. Plus she's eventually getting a rework, which she needs badly.\nAkali's not doing too bad either. I personally think she needs a slight buff to her Q's base missile damage. Trying to last hit with that piddly 35-55 is a nightmare. Lanning phase is **supposed** to be rough for her, but damn, give a girl a chance.\nLeblanc is a work in progress.\nThe others (kata, fizz, ekko, kass) all seem to be doing great ( too great @_@) and are top tier picks. I feel like ap assassins are actually in a pretty great spot, but could use another item or two that's dedicated specifically to them. \n\nI will agree that Nid Mid is dead and needs something to bring her back to life. She's doing great in the jungle, but she's got very little to offer in mid. Would be nice if there was a way to make her a more viable solo laner without buffing her already good pick as a jungler.
