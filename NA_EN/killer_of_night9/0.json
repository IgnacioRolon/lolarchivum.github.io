Tell me, do you like when a zilean ults and you basically either have to decide between trying to blow your load on him and kill him and hope you have the damage and cooldowns to kill him again when he revives, or not doing shit to him for 10 years because he will revive. A shield is basically the same thing lmao. You either try your absolute hardest to burst it down, or try to wait for it to go away.

The whole point of Shen ultimate  is to reduce damage and block major abilities before he comes in and turns the fight. You have no argument other than don’t block the ultimate. That’s a non-point.

BOTH have common skills that are technically executes.\n\nA few Patches ago, Lee Sin joined them with his Q rework, which now dramatically does more damage based on Missing HP.\n\nAnd none of the three I mentioned are really mitigatable champs if their target is below 25% HP. You will die to all of them if you are that low, because that's how much their damage scales.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Horse Grenades","date":"2018-11-19T19:55:10.273+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=BeatzBoyFTW,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=xvHi8iZj,comment-id=000b0000000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2018-11-19T18:26:16.225+0000)\n>\n> A bullshit mechanic that only **2 out of 141 champions utilizes**.

Bullshit is bullshit. Maybe you should make an argument so that I can listen to it?\n\nYou bitch and moan about tank top viktor when he's just 1/141 champs.

Viktor is just a \"counterpick.\" (albeit a bullshit counterpick because of a toxic kit towards top laners) \n\n2. I UNDERSTAND how an execute works, I disagree with it rewarding the wrong kind of gameplay, and celebrating bullshit mechanics.\n\n3. Why are you so hostile? It's not a tantrum, and I feel like you being so condescending is the only \"immature\" part of this thread. It's  my opinion, on what I feel is a legitimate problem with the game, you clearly don't agree, but I don't really see any substance to your argument. It seems like it's just, \"because thats the way it is\"","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Kaioko","date":"2018-11-19T20:31:31.845+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Shields =/= health.
