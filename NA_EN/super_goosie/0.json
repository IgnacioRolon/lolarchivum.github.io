I logged in last week and got a chat ban.... \r\n\r\nJust to mention -- my friend that has a troll account still has not been banned nor penalised, however, one that is having a bad week and rants on chat gets penalised? ok... \r\n\r\nThe honor / report system is poor. It doesn&#039;t discriminate between people having a bad moment in life to those that are poor in character. the system should take into account the honors you&#039;ve been having with the reports and send to those players with a mix (or simply to everyone getting reported frequently) a message or a warning to call down as they are being reported for X. People Shouldn&#039;t get penalised without warning and lose the honor and maybe what they were fighting for all season. \r\nFor example, no decent school or parent punishes a kid without a warning. \r\nRiot should help players be nicer and good teammates not only after one is reported with a level 1 honor. it should help them before they fall. \r\n\r\nI am sorry i was toxic and i wished i had had a warning. I bet many just like me would have evaluate their mood and behaviour and modify it if given the opportunity. Now, as i made this account just a couple of weeks before season was over i wont get the one thing i came back into the game. :( \r\n\r\ni hope this system evolves, because it is lacking and it is quite unfair to many. i like the game and i just want it to be better.","replies":[{"poster":"Ice Weasel X","date":"2018-11-10T04:14:05.867+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Under the old report system, the % of games you got reported for mattered heavily, so new accounts would receive pop-up behavioral warnings even if they were fairly innocent.  I'm not sure if any of that carried over to the current system, but if you just created that account and got reported in 20 games, that'd be a much larger % of your overall game count than it would be for an older account.\n\nWarnings should probably be brought back, but probably not in the form they were before.  There was a randomish delay after getting reported before a warning popped up on your screen, but many players automatically assumed that report came from the very last game they played.  If the warning popped up during post game chat, it caused retaliatory reports against whomever they thought reported them.\n\nMaybe the way we get honor updates/orbs/key frags at login, a warning message could pop up instead.  \"You've been reported more than usual in recent games.  Please remember to keep a cool head.\" The warning doesn't automatically get associated with a specific game that players just exited if it's displayed upon login.  Since it's just a warning, it wouldn't have to conflict with honor bonuses like orbs and key frags, either.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-11-10T05:17:03.111+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"The penalty *is* the warning.\n\nA lot of games will just permban the first time.
