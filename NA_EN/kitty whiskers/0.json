If you're using macros to perform something for you that would otherwise not be possible, then you're creating an unfair advantage.   Be extra cautious about this, and check out our [third party](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/5kx4F7VE-reminder-third-party-applications) guide.  I'd say stick to the awesome chroma themes, and leave the automatic plays outside of League!","replies":[]},{"poster":"NinjaGuy69","date":"2017-06-14T16:44:23.567+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Any script or macro that gives a player an unfair advantage over other players is forbidden by Riot and can easily get you banned for cheating.
