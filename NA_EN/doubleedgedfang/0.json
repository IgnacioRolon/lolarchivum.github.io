But I know when he doubleshots he tends to puts his gun side by side so it&#039;s hard to tell when the animation is thick like this skin. Maybe this is already fixed on the PBE because I played him a week or two ago.\r\n\r\nMaybe give this a look Rioters? Just want a good bug-less skin for him XD","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-09-08T21:59:52.917+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey DoubleEdgedFang! \n\nThis is an issue that's actually been occurring since Lucian's launch. We're currently looking into the animation issue and are looking to resolve the issue. Unfortunately, this will not be fixed for PROJECT: Lucian's launch.
