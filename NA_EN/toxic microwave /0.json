When I look it up, it is still there. However, when I go to log in, I am told that I am I attempting to log into an account from a different region and I must choose the appropriate region. Now this is where it gets better.  tried doing as told, and I seem to be on none of the other regions. \r\nI don't know what to do. My Summoner name is American Liqueur, and you can see me on the N.A server. \r\nI am in  a state of panic because I can also no longer log into my account on this website. \r\nPlease help me in any way. I have tried all the possible things me and a friend can think of.\r\nAnd yes, I have sent a ticket to the riot support.
