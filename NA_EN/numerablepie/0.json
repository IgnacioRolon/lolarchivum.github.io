This wouldn't have been an issue if Kled had been a better champion in my mind. So I put in a request to help with that and get my account back in order and I waited a few days. After a few days had passed (Today) I got an email back and they said they had rolled back my account. So I got on thinking I had my refund tokens back, when really I had lost 10 RP and I thought no big deal but I went onto the page where you can look at your refund tokens and they were all gone and I scrolled down and saw that Diana, Olaf, and Nidalee had all been refunded but I had received no RP ( I had purchased Diana, and Olaf with RP) I got the IP from Nidalee but I wasn't as worried about that because I suck as Nidalee. I enjoyed playing Diana and had even earned a Hextech chest as her, Olaf I don't really care about but that is off topic. So I went a submitted a ticked under Technical Issues, and I was wondering if that was the best place to enter the ticket as I no longer had any issues with recovering my account, I also would greatly appreciate it if you could tell me if you have had any issues like it.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-18T22:51:52.416+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We'd like to help with this and see if er can provide any further reparations!
