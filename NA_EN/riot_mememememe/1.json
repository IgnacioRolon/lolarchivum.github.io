They're just some small changes to his different taunts that would make the skin look much more clean. I will list them from easiest to hardest.\n\n1. Change the sneeze\n\nWhen Zombie Nunu laughs Willump sneezes and the problem is that the sneeze cloud he creates looks like snow or some kind of frost. It would look much better if it was coloured green, making it look radioactive or something. I've made an example.\nhttps://i.imgur.com/FESZSlL.png\n\n2. Change the Snowman\n\nThis one has been requsted before but it would really improve the skin. The easiest solution would be to change the snowmans hue to be more slimy green looking, but the best anwser would be to make a new model, because then you could make it look like the slayer pantheon skin, giving Zombie Willump a reason for disliking and smashing it. I've made an example of what it could look like.\nhttps://i.imgur.com/kMmCLN2.png\n\n3. Change the flute music\n\nHere's the hardest one, but it would be really cool. Give Zombie Nunu a diferent tune when he's playing the flute. The music he should be playing is the one from the Zombie login, harrowing 2015. I looked at which part would fit best and I came to the conclusion that at 47 seconds in, if you slow down the video to 0.5 speed, then it sounds really cool, and would fit very well if you played it on a flute.\nhttps://youtu.be/r-_fNivZXno?t=47\n\nThose are the things that, in my opinion, would make the skin look much more clean, and would give a lot more depth to it. I really love the new Nunu&Willump, and I hope to play and have lots of fun with this skin, I just want it to look perfect!\n{{sticker:zombie-nunu-hearts}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"OMG SKINNY","date":"2018-08-15T20:12:27.478+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"One error I noticed is that in the splash art for Workshop Nunu & Willump, Nunu has brown hair but in game, he has orange???
