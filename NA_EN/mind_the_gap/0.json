I keep the new client updated and try it out every time a new patch is released. Now that Riot made the legacy client's patcher launch the new client firstly, I always have to launch it first and then click on \"Launch legacy client\". This is uncomfortable for me and I can't find an uninstaller in Riot Games -> League of Legends folder. I can't find any in \"Programs and features\" either. Could you please help me with removing the new client so I don't have to use the new client?\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, since it's a test version client, it shouldn't be so \"violent\" and be launched firstly every time I launch LoL. I would suggest implementing a remover for the new client, but for now I just need to get through this. I'd be grateful if you could suggest things! ;)","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-18T17:25:54.877+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can also open the legacy client through the original launcher located in the Riot Games folder, as \"lol.launcher\".  Share your feedback with the client devs as well, over at the[ client discussion ](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/alpha-client-discussion)boards.

The original launcher does open the new client anyway. :/\n\nIf I delete league_client and league_client_en_gb folders, the original launcher does nothing when clicking on the \"LAUNCH\" button. Whenever I change the language, the original launcher starts updating the new client.\n\nEdit: I've found a solution. There's a \"user.cfg\" that contains some \"leagueOptIn\" or what and \"yes\". I edited it to \"no\" and it worked! :)","replies":[{"poster":"Se≈Çver","date":"2016-11-19T12:47:49.573+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you so much you helped me get this crap away its buggy it looks real shit like a mobile game or something and when i try to go in champ select it freeze and at 12 secs it unfreeze while it freezes i cant do any runes or masterys i run the old luncher as loong as i can,i dont want that crap design and buggy launcher","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tahngarthor","date":"2016-11-18T20:47:26.682+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"be aware that the new client will eventually replace the old one, so make sure to be vocal about the problems you're having with it so they can make improvements. (Also there are some improvements they plan to make but can't until after the old client is retired, for compatibility reasons).\n\nobviously they know about the missing features like bots in custom games, featured game modes, and other things that are clearly missing so you don't need to report that, but anything else is fair game.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
