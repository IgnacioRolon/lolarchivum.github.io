Their models were completely invisible which made them untargatable. Even the announcer didn&#039;t announce when they died it just said Unknown_Champion has been slain and a blue box. When I opened up tab it only displayed 3 players on the other team. \r\n\r\nNeedless to say we lost and I got blamed for it  because the invisible untargatble jungler ganked me several times and I ended up being 4/11.\r\n\r\nThis makes me want to never play another game of League ever again. \r\n\r\nThis is absolutely unacceptable.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-11-10T17:43:13.569+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey TheMentalLizard,\n\nFrom the sounds of it, you may have some jumbled files. I would suggest a client repair. \n\n- Open the LoL Client\n- Click the [?] in the upper right hand corner of the client. \n- Select [Repair]\n\nThis should correct any misplaced files in the game and prevent this from happening in the future. If you're still experiencing this after the repair, please [submit a ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=34190) so we can further help troubleshoot the issue.","replies":[]}]}
