So i was wondering, how does one acquire an S? ( recnt game 10/2/10 as Malphite with 2nd best DMG and top CS on team.)","replies":[{"poster":"Raka Flaka MD","date":"2016-05-04T16:46:36.787+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's based off the score avg. for your champ in your lane.

For example, we look at an Annie going mid differently from an Annie going support. We take a series of performance metrics and compare how you did to all other players in your region in that specific champion/position combination.\n\nThis is percentile-driven; earning a high score means you performed in the top x% of players in that champion/position combination.\n\n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"JayHog1992","date":"2016-05-04T16:48:24.771+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ended up getting an S today on Veigar Support. About 7/1/12 because I was busy warding and keeping the enemy on lockdown with my E.\n\nSometimes crazy stuff works best.\n\nAlso pink wards. Placing pink wards is a score booster if you do it at least twice or thrice.","replies":[]}]}
