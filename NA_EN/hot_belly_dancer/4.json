I assume players more complaining about different aspects of the game they added like dungeon finder or w/e people complain about in WoW. Maybe they should have listened, but to the casual player those different aspects they added made the game easier to pickup and play. Veterans going to cry about it but eventually they quit and Blizzard or Riot needs new revenue from somewhere. So they make changes to get new players interested. Whether WoW changed or not doesn't matter to me as I have played every expansion and get sick of it after a couple weeks.

It doesn't matter what season the game is in everyone just going to qq about something. \n\nlmfao sports have also been around for much longer and still tweak rules all the time. Plus this is a video game, its a little different. I am sure if league was out for a hundred years changes that were made would be minor. \n\nSince Riot doesn't exactly release the numbers it hard to say exactly how the game's popularity has changed over time. Its all speculation really. Yes, Riot has made some dumbass changes. But in the end the game is still the same game. It might take some time to adjust to the changes but you would still recognize the core of the game no matter how much time you take off playing it. \n\n{{champion:44}} rework was a blessing. His old kit was boring as shit.{{champion:14}} before rework was beyond retarded. Some of the major reworks weren't the best cough {{champion:82}}, but some of the minor one's worked out pretty well {{champion:42}} {{champion:51}}. {{champion:78}} rework was well... interesting.  \n\nThank god they finally got rid of sated devourer. That was a terrible addition.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"WoonStruck","date":"2016-09-07T16:58:23.217+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"Riot's fixed things that needed fixing, according to the community, then completely and totally fucked up things that were perfectly fine, against the will of the community, essentially degrading the quality of the game. \n\nTake off the rose-tinted glasses yourself. Riot has made more significant mistakes than significant improvements at this point. \n\nIn what way would the game be more boring if it was similar to season 4 or 5? The game was at one of its most stable states during seasons 4 and 5: before Riot decided they knew what we wanted better than we do. \n\nSeriously, what would make it dull? What has season 6 brought that makes this game more fun, since you seem to be implying it was nothing but improvement? Absolutely nothing. All they've done, not even counting the shit-fest that is Dynamic Queue, is completely fuck up matchmaking for everyone, including normals, and completely fuck up balance with keystones. Way stronger offensive masteries with obscenely weaker defensive masteries doesn't help either.

I was undoubtedly in the minority there. *Yeeep.*\n\nS4 was the season of assassins and late game hypercarries. Look in the mirror.
