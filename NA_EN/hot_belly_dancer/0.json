I play with a usual group and several of us experience the bug where if you're in a lobby waiting to queue and you click on the hextech crafting icon it will immediately close the client, this happens to us pretty much on a daily basis and we have all tried fresh installs yet it still persists.  \n\nThere also seems to be a common issue in champion select where randomly someone's client will freeze and if you try to close the client and rejoin it will immediately dodge the queue and force the wait time before you can queue again.\n\nThese are common issues that affect my entire group and while we've grown accustomed to them for the most part, we're used to playing maybe 8-10 games some nights but mostly just normals.

I, as well as others, cannot even log into the servers at the moment. There is definitely something going on with the servers at the moment. I understand if you cannot promote this guy, but maybe put him into a promo with a free win if you can? Maybe he should have the match switched to loss prevented, and the rank regiven to him. He would have had the chance to win and get his mmr away from the demotion zone and back up to where he wants it. He should atleast get a chance right? Anyway, I dont want to be mean or anything and I dont mean to offend you guys at riot either, it is just that I believe there is something wrong and he deserves a second chance! Sorry if this comes across as mean.\n\nedit: sorry OP for spamming your log, just wanted to swap this comment to a reply to the rioter","replies":[{"poster":"Hot Belly Dancer","date":"2016-06-21T18:28:49.669+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"haha thats fine, i like how considerate youre being right now xD","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Hot Belly Dancer","date":"2016-06-21T00:21:06.993+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, i was at 75% then it said disconnected. but my internet was perfectly fine!

Riot official responses was that there was nothing wrong with my internet and they couldnt find a reason why I was having this issue. For a while i thought my roommates where having a high intern consumption, then it happened to me alot when i was home alone with no one else on internet. It started after the MYMU. Anyway League of Lag made me salty alot. Just wanted to know if anyone else had similar bad experience like your carrying your team and suddenly your get 400 ms spikes( i usualy have 36 ms constant) it went up to 2000 ms at one point. It even prevent me from banning a champ once thus making me dodge( I was so salty ) And Last game i was playing I actually didnt connect at all and the remake function was done.
