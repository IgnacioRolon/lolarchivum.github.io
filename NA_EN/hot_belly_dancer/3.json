You can not already have an opinion on her lol.\n\nYou can play 5 games of her and see the difference, regardless of how long she's been released. She's definitely more clunky, she doesn't feel as smooth to play. Her W as a MS boost feels very awkward and doesn't fit Kat well.","replies":[{"poster":"EastCoastConcept","date":"2016-11-11T03:45:36.120+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you mained katarina, like I always have, you can easily see the ins and outs of any rework.
