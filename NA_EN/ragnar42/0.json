When there's mobility thrown into the mix, the ability to disengage just becomes too easy and most fights will end in stalemate of no one dying.\n\nOn UoL's team, they had one person with a dash, and that was Caitlyn. With an immobile comp, it becomes a do or die fight every time. And that's exactly what happened here. Yes, there were mistakes made and poor calls and throws on both sides, but what it comes down to though is the nature of the comp UoL which forced a 100% commitment from any fight. \n\nThis is why mobility lacks excitement now...yes it can be exciting to see people flying around the map, but the ability to avoid a fight you know you're going to lose becomes increasingly easier, which leads to games being a bore to watch. I will always take watching a fight ending in both teams steam rolling each other then one team setting up a flashy play to take one person out then running away. \n\nI will agree though that your description fits exactly how Riot sees the game at the current moment.

It's exciting to see constant fights and commitment to a fight you cant escape from.  Play becomes more decision based than reaction based.  \n\nLee is about to dive into 3 people alone?  It's okay, he'll safeguard out.  LB didn't get a kill?  Press W again.  Zed is in a bad position?  He can shadow dash away.  Kalista is in a tricky spot?  Doesn't matter because she has a dash on every single auto attack.  \n\nNunu can't leave the teamfight, Yorick is...Yorick - he doesn't do a whole lot of anything, Nautilus needs a clear shot to terrain to make an escape, but even then, he's so slow, etc.  Everything has to be thought out beforehand rather than reacting to what happens faster than the other person, and that's the direction I think Riot should be taking for League.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"AkabaneKun","date":"2015-03-20T21:32:52.783+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can see the sweat in lee shiny head right now.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JumbaJoopleakley","date":"2015-03-20T21:32:32.679+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"This morning I thought about buying Yorick.
