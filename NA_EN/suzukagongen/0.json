Everything seems fine until i get into champion select of a ranked game , people's ban timers will run out and freeze on 0 and then i will be unable to pick  a champion and a few moments later i wind up being kicked out of the room with a long wait time. My internet is fine, connection is fine, PC is fine and it started happening after the new update. I've lost probably close to 50 lp trying to join a game and I'm just wondering if anyone else is having this problem or if there is a known fix? \r\n\r\nthanks","replies":[{"poster":"Proxiimus","date":"2016-12-15T01:09:00.531+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For what its worth and what Porocles said.. I used to have the same issue.. When I ran into this issue it usually was when I was loading a webpage while in champ select, or for instance loading a Twitch stream/browsing them etc. To fix it I basically just didn't do anything but pick and ban during the time making sure all my webpages were stopped or streams were paused. Hope it helps.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-14T23:19:00.785+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You may be having a weak connection here, so it's causing you to lose sync in champion select and getting left behind.
