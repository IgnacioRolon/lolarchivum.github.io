If your team-chat contained punishable stuff (yet you wern't reported by anyone on your team) and the punishment was for that, then your beef should be that the system judged chat logs that it shouldn't have considered. Because I see nothing in those support tickets acknowledging that your team chat was not considered.\n\nYour intentional omission of the teamchat implies that they did give you logs that were in teamchat.

This is due to the fact that I had a 5 queue and therefor it is irrelevant the team logs as I explain If I am in a 5 queue and zt is used then that is when I have my team come and vouch and get it reversed which is now what is happening.

About your only shot would be to compile all your teammates saying your behavior is okay into one ticket and submitting that ticket.\n\nI am a bit puzzled that I can't find the game in question though.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2019-10-23T04:49:35.607+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MythicAgent,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=wPNymUlh,comment-id=00100000,timestamp=2019-10-23T03:37:59.060+0000)Or at least trying as Herald I do not understand you trying to force out logs that I am not at all discussing if people want them they can ask.\n\nPeople have asked. If you are posting for community input on your case you should provide the full case. Editting or omitting behavior is not helpful or a productive use of anyone's time, and you clearly have a support ticket with the logs in them which you could present -- both to defend your claim you did not use zero tolerance language AND to support your claim than the entirety of your all chat behavior is acceptable.

I will have them post asap in response to you and if you could get tantrum to look that would be great.

Breaking a minor rule, like engaging the team in useless arguments, has a minor punishment: a chat restriction. Breaking that same rule over and over again, however, doesn't prompt an endless series of chat restrictions. The severity of the punishment ramps up over time, because the goal is to eliminate the punished player's willingness to break the game's rules. If two chat restrictions don't stop the useless arguments, the system will increase the punishment to a 14-day suspension and deliver a very clear message that the continued rule-breaking is becoming a serious issue and any further instances will result in a permaban. Again, the point is to put a stop to this misbehavior. If a player is more interested in repeatedly breaking the rules than in maintaining access to their account, they'll lose access to their account.\n\nOf course, it's possible to break major rules, like cheating, threatening people, or using chat for hate speech, and skip punishment tiers so that a clean account ends up with a 14-day suspension or even a permaban.\n\nFrom [Riot's support knowledgebase](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207489286-Instant-Feedback-System-FAQ-):\n\n> **PUNISHMENTS GENERALLY FOLLOW A BASIC ESCALATION PATH:**\n> \n> * First Offense: 10 Game Chat Restriction\n> * Second Offense: 25 Game Chat Restriction\n> * Third Offense: Two Week Suspension\n> * Fourth Offense: Permanent Suspension\n> \n> However, it is possible to skip to a Two Week or Permanent suspension based on the severity of the behavior in the game. Excessive negative behavior can result in a Two-Week or Permanent suspension at any time without having a chat restriction on the account.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Summoner SpeII","date":"2019-10-22T02:02:19.844+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":3,"body":"so it is correct, my assumption that riot scans for the words dog.\nUnless someone knows otherwise","replies":[]}]}
