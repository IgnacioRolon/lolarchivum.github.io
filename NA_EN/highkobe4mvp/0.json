I have googled and youtubed it, but everything is for the old forums I could find. \" go advanced\" and the \"paper clip\" but when I create a discussion there are no such options besides the link menu, which i cant seem to get the pictures into. I've tried to copy and paste, and if i drop the picture into the bar it just pulls up a window of the picture over the page i had. This player said very harsh and out right lies about what i said in game \" He wants my military husband to die to ISIS\" ect. I need to post this to get this player out of our community. Please help","replies":[{"poster":"HighKobe4mvp","date":"2017-01-24T21:19:03.604+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you Porocles, that does make me feel better. I was just worried because she said it in after game chat and not the game log. We did argue for most of the game, mostly typical \"you're a bronzie banter\", but I would never go to the extremes of saying anything she accused me of. Thanks for the quick response aswell, and providing the best game on the market Riot!! :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-24T17:52:50.937+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The suggested comments made are pretty awful and it sucks that happened to you.  As a heads up, though, naming and shaming or putting unwanted attention towards others on the boards is frowned on.  For that reason I've edited out the name in your post.  Continue using the reporting tool after the game so our player behavior team can review those cases.  \n\nAlso, rest easy knowing that fake reports won't hurt you, and will just dig a bigger hole for the player actually causing you that negative experience.  If you think about it, they're just causing more trouble by throwing disturbance into all chat.  He can try and stack reports against you, but they will amount to nothing because you've done nothing wrong.  Mute the player and focus on the game.  I hope that helps bring some ease!","replies":[]}]}
