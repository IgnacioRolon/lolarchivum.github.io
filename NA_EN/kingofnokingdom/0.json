Since 6.18 I noticed huge fps drops in league.\r\nAs soon as I get to lane, fps drops from ~120 to 30-40 for a second, then goes back up. Keeps jumping up and down.\r\n\r\nDrivers are latest, no major changes to PC in a long time. Fps drops started since 6.18.\r\nTried disabling pretty much every other software on pc, still the same. \r\nNo other game is dropping fps only league of legends.\r\n\r\nRan out of things to try.","replies":[{"poster":"Muhwiiee","date":"2016-09-24T02:40:24.290+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm having the same issue with my FPS, i tried about everything on the FPS troubleshooter my computer it was perfectly fine until a week or two ago.

Also, most if it is not supposed to help, because like I said it started since 6.18 and no other game has any issues. So can't be malware, cant be settings. But I did everything from the list anyway, obviously no improvement.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-23T18:04:08.838+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for trying, though it sucks you're still having the issue.
