I asked about being routed through another source and they said it was worse. Honestly not sure how 180 ping and constant spikes could be worse. Only other option in town is someone with poor reviews and after talking with a tech over the phone he didn't seem like it would be a guaranteed improvement. Or I confused him and as he suggested I use another league server after asking if he could run some trace testing. \n\nI guess I'll ask a couple shot in the dark questions \n\nDo you have any information in your database about this ISP (http://residential.wavebroadband.com/the-wave-difference/)  \nWould using a VPN  do anything? (Pretty sure no but want to confirm)\nHow long would you  estimate a fix to occur with their partner?

I'd be sure to clarify with them that the IP you provided is a test server that we've set up and that it can be used to determine which partner they should route you through. \n\nLet me know if you have any other questions.","replies":[]}]}
