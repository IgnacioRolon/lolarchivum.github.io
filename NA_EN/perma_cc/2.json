I wanted her nerfed but this is too much.... if she is ognna do no damage then her sleep needs to have cooldown reduction added back.

Because they nerfed the Q. Nerfing her push power is fine but they need to pick between the burst or the wave clear. Becasue atm she has no wave clear as a weakness for having burst but also doesnt have burst now.... so she is a walking ball of useless atm. Would be better played as a support when she doesnt have good wave management or ap ratios.","replies":[{"poster":"Spicy Rice","date":"2018-02-23T23:04:03.880+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"With the current values, assuming she hits everything (except w) zoe does about 100 less damage at 400 ap than a full annie combo (excluding tibbers autos)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"leakinb","date":"2018-02-23T02:56:18.214+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{champion:142}} is just like {{champion:157}} {{champion:92}} \nYou can't make her too good, or else the really good players will dominate the game using her","replies":[{"poster":"Malix Farwin","date":"2018-02-23T03:05:37.575+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=leakinb,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=I54aLkLa,comment-id=0006,timestamp=2018-02-23T02:56:18.214+0000)\n>\n> {{champion:142}} is just like {{champion:157}} {{champion:92}} \n> You can&#x27;t make her too good, or else the really good players will dominate the game using her\n\nThe thing is about Zoe is she wasn't overpowered and she wasn't just hyper dominating at any elo. There were several Mid laners beating her. The Problem with Zoe is she had the pre-reworked Nidalee problem where a lot of her damage was baked into 1 ability that was a ranged attack. People banned nidalee back then for the exact same reason really. The difference of course is that they properly shifted nidalee's damage elsewhere while still giving her okay way cleave.\n\nZoe right now has the nerfed Q and she easily goes oom while trying to keep minions from pushing her tower and fails at both now. Thats her current problem right now.","replies":[{"poster":"Spicy Rice","date":"2018-02-23T03:08:17.356+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"She's a burst mage, who has a low cd burst.

With that being said i did say the nerfs were warranted but they definitely overshot the Q by around 5%-10% and they didn't compensate enough in other areas. They could of moved a bit more dmg into P, W, and E. Also if they wanted you to be more reliant on max range Qs they should of shrunk the distance requirement a bit. As it stands a max range Q hardly does more than a Syndra or Annie Q.","replies":[{"poster":"KVbqbFsC8e","date":"2018-02-23T03:43:04.489+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Its pretty ridiculous to say something isn't overpowered when it is dominant at the highest level of play.
