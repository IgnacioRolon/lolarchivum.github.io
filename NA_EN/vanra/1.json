Also gives AP when basic attacking or hitting champs with abilities. Also every 3rd basic attack does a large amount of %max hp true damage based on his AP.  Also every 90 seconds he can click on an allied champion, and both he and the champion gain a protective veil like Malzahar's that lets them ignore 80% of the damage from the next ability used on them, as well as any CC on that ability.\r\n\r\nQ - Happy Blast: Like Veigar's Q but only hits one enemy, but stuns. Plus does Grievous Wounds.\r\n\r\nW - Dark Matters: Moogar dashes. Casting again does an attack like Veigar's W but does 2% less damage, but goes up instead of down and knocks opponents up.\r\n\r\nE - Stealth Cage: Like Veigar's E but works on allies. Grants stealth + speed boost when touched. Also Moogar dashes when he uses it. Also he gains massive health and mana regen when he can be seen the enemy team because why not.\r\n\r\nR - Primordial Pop: Like Veigar's R but only does 90% of the damage, however landing a kill with it gives all his nearby teammates full gold and it can be used again in the next few seconds.  It's also reset if the enemy uses hourglass, guardian angel, spell shield, or any other means of avoiding it, because fun is the most important thing and where would the fun be in that?  Also passive: if Moogar dies but presses his ult within a few seconds, he comes back as a zombie for 6 seconds or until he casts his ult.  This is a fair ability because using it makes Moogar's player say something insulting about his opponent and risk getting banned.\r\n\r\nPlaying against Moogar:\r\n\r\nMoogar may seem OP, but that's because you're bad at the game. There are actually there are lots of options for dealing with him:\r\n1. Ban him.\r\n2. Just CC him (twice).\r\n3. Git gud.","replies":[{"poster":"BlackKnightJack","date":"2019-08-28T03:46:04.464+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wait. I just got it. This is a joke concept, isn't it?","replies":[]}]}
