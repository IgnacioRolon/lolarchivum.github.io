There are things that, in my opinion, should be tested in preseason and not in the middle of a season. \r\n\r\nI mean, i&#039;m ok for the mage update but it will be extremely hard to adapt to these new things all together (the new dragon, new rift herald, timers, new items, champions kit mini-rework), and by the time you try to balance the things out the season will be already over.","replies":[{"poster":"Helmight","date":"2016-04-19T21:56:43.448+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To be honest, I feel like Riot is going to be establishing a trend of these mid-year updates. Preseason is a good time to make large changes to the game because there's no competitive play happening, but because of the introduction of MSI, Riot's now got time in the middle of the season to do updates. \n\nAnd, given that Riot wants to do passes on other classes of champions like assassins and artillery mages, it makes sense. It'd take them FOREVER to update one class a year, but two is a lot more manageable.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Evewynn","date":"2016-04-19T21:34:41.650+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think riot is trying to address a lot of the negative feelings regarding the beginning of season 6.
