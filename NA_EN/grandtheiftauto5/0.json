I haven&#039;t gone up in checkpoint. I&#039;d like to participate in the PBE but I can&#039;t due to the sheer fact that I cant level up my honor, my last game i got 3 honors. I havent gotten a lot but i&#039;ve gotten some, i do think that honor checkpoints should be easier to go to. Any one know why my honor check point hasn&#039;t gone up?\r\nIGN: GrandTheiftAuto5\r\n|\r\n|\r\n{{champion:75}}","replies":[{"poster":"Ach3ck","date":"2018-11-03T20:54:24.182+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"your honor hasent gone up because riot dosent want your honor to go up","replies":[]}]}
