This annoys me cause 1) the Noxian Champions look no different from their Universe  common military counterpart, and 2) for a city-state of military cohesion and unity their isn&#039;t much uniform with the Champions in Demacia.\r\n\r\nOkay. Let&#039;s take away Fiora, Vayne, Lucian and Poppy they obviously didn&#039;t stay in the military and one&#039;s a Yordle that just happens to love the place. As well as J4 and Shyv cause they&#039;re a rather liberal branch of the military. But what of Xin,Quinn, Garen and Lux?","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2018-02-22T16:30:22.513+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's mostly because Demacia used to have a national colour scheme of seemingly equal emphasis on silver, blue, and gold, until Riot retcon it to be white base with gold outlines.\n\nhttps://scontent.cdninstagram.com/t/27574526_701705710033069_3613574939262582784_n.jpg\n\nFrom this fan art it displays the some of the earliest Demacian champions which used the old colour schemes of Demacian champs, they seem indeed very much uniform in colour with each other given that was the colour of Demacia after all. It isn't to say there were not outliners, such as Vayne and Shyv, who had their reasons for having more \"personalised\" style for similar reasons as say, XIn to some extent, but they mostly share a similar vibe and theme with again, seeming equal emphasis on silver, blue, and gold. But unfortunately that is not matching the now white focused Demacia national colour scheme anymore. \n\nThis is the reason why some of the older Demacian champs are now slowly going into visual updates to ensure consistency of this, such as Galio being changed to white from blue during his rework, or Xin's splash art update for instance.\n\n......\n\nThis also applies to Noxus too, how Swain got changed from his green robe into a black and red colour scheme (Noxus's national colour scheme). Same stuff.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Valor Bot","date":"2018-02-22T16:38:02.016+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"Most Demacian champions were created and designed way before the visual aesthetic of the faction had been locked in and solidified. Out of all of them I’d say Poppy, Taric and Galio are the only ones who are truly representative of its new look and feel (and even then, Taric is more Targonian than anything, after his comic “Ascent”). An argument could be made for Fiora as well, though I suspect she was also designed before the major worldbuilding update to Demacia.","replies":[{"poster":"Whren","date":"2018-02-22T18:51:04.745+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"Y'all are right, this is basically the reason.","replies":[{"poster":"Illâoi Evê Siôn","date":"2018-02-22T19:33:45.336+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I get that aesthetics in clothing and appearance should be similar if appropriate, but please don't take it too far with future champions, like how Swain's team made him look like a Blood Mage because he's from Noxus.","replies":[{"poster":"Whren","date":"2018-02-22T19:42:13.336+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah! I definitely think we can do better at that. However, and I don't work directly on League itself, I can only imagine the inherent difficulties in trying to make characters iconic and to make them look cohesive within the universe, with the small character size and everything in the game. \n\n(And also in my biased defense of the Swain team's decision to make him red, Swain IS a very prominent figure within Noxus and I like that he now represents the faction at large. If they ever revisit Draven's visuals, for instance, I would love to see him remain that quirky mix of colors because, well, Draven)","replies":[{"poster":"Basilio","date":"2018-02-23T07:31:07.931+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"But is there a plan for a VU? or is my concern not even in the radar for the art department?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Valor Bot","date":"2018-02-22T20:44:39.134+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"So the Worldbuilding team is a sect of Riot on its own separate from League of Legends?

So why be inconsistent?\n\nAlso aren't all Crownguards now part of the military?
