Even more annoying when someone in your team keeps wanting to surrender the vote ends in 1/4 every time but the exact same person keeps wanting to surrender and you have to once again hover your cursor over the character portraits one at a time just to find out who wants to surrender. It's tedious and annoying, there is no reason for the summoner names to not be in the TAB interface","replies":[]},{"poster":"Evewynn","date":"2015-08-06T21:53:22.507+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree, it was the one thing I didn't like about the HUD update.
