See if auto-configuring your firewall settings helps via the [hextech repair tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367).  Double check anti-virus settings as well and go over the steps in the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide.
