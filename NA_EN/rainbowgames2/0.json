After three year, I&#039;ve started to have enough the game. I was not getting any better at the game and believe me I&#039;ve tried, people have told me to give it time so I gave it three years and yet I&#039;m still not good. Hell, the only character I can play well is Teemo and that is if I&#039;m against a Yas mid. I&#039;ve tried every lane, adc was the only one I enjoyed, minus my terrible support every game.\r\n\r\nThe longer I play the more I see how broken the game is, you have champs that only require like one kill and already they can destroy you in lane with two hits, it&#039;s dumb. Don&#039;t get me started on the community, the community is so toxic, It&#039;s not even funny.\r\n\r\nSo on to my problem, I&#039;m done with league but I cannot seem to uninstall it, when I try it just crashes for no reason.","replies":[]}
