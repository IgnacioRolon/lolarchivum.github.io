I usually play normals to relax from a stressful day and getting camped by a jungle/mid duo is not the best way to do so, especially when it&#039;s a level 2 twitch gank. I counted 4 ganks within 10 minutes. Who wouldn&#039;t get tilted? I understand that I should respect the enemy team, but don&#039;t you think that&#039;s a bit much and even so, that&#039;s hardly considered toxic compared to the people I&#039;ve met in my games... Still, I continued to play. I have never rage quit EVER in the game and deserted my team, but I most certainly do get tilted like any other normal human being. So, I thought a little friendly banter would never hurt anyone.\n\nObviously after we won the game, the enemy duo: [removed] and [removed] had a few remarks in the end-game chat and I&#039;m assuming they both reported me. I&#039;ve had a few bad games over the past few years like anyone would, but the fact that I got a 2 week suspension and my seasonal rewards taken away over this particular game just doesn&#039;t make sense... If I was constantly flaming my OWN team, that would make sense (not implying that I flame at all), but I rarely flame.\n\nI&#039;m not asking for an un-ban and my seasonal rewards back (though I would appreciate it :D ), but I honestly want you to review my previous games and see if I really am toxic. Please take the time and  review the chat log of my past few games and just get a gauge at my behavior. If you truly deem my behavior to be &quot;far below the standards of the League community,&quot; please post chat logs of me to justify your decision; I will respect the decision and accept my 2 week suspension and loss of seasonal rewards if so. Otherwise, with all due respect, I STRONGLY believe that I am not a toxic player compared to the people I have met in my games... \n\nIf you could just take a moment to look at my past games, I would greatly appreciate it. :)\n\nThanks.\n\nGame 1\nRhapist: rekt\nRhapist: wtf\nRhapist: u cuck\nRhapist: no f\nRhapist: cucklord\nRhapist: rekt\nRhapist: kys\nRhapist: spaace aids\nRhapist: :D\nRhapist: fuk\nRhapist: not wurf \nRhapist: :(\nRhapist: still had f feelsbadman\nRhapist: wut..\nRhapist: aa&#039;d that ward lOL\nRhapist: !\nRhapist: All kys\nRhapist: kys\nRhapist: ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh\nRhapist: where r my crits\nRhapist: literally 1 second\nRhapist: away from cd&#039;s\nRhapist: :(\nRhapist: .\nRhapist: all WTF\nRhapist: WTF\nRhapist: mid lane in2k17 lul\nRhapist: sneky sneky","replies":[{"poster":"TheViper7911","date":"2017-07-12T04:45:38.003+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"You told someone to kill themselves.
