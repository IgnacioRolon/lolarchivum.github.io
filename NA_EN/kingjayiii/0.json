This happened, because of numerous reason, me and teammates alike however, one reason  that stood above all was our afk top lanner. So I thought about well dang this sucks I&#039;m going to use Lp  because of someone else negligence to want to play the game. So I thought about a simple compromise so that way others wont be as hurt when someone afks. The comprise is, how about  the one person who decided to leave loose&#039;s Lp, because how is it fair to others who want to play the game with a handicap that was out of there control. I mean it can be easily applied along with the lever buster punishment, because at the end of the day the leaver buster goes directly to that one person, so why not the lose of Lp to that person as well, I&#039;m sure it could be coded the same way. Also just like in the beginning of the game, when somone doesnt leave base after a certain time, the game goes into a remake. Why not apply that same concept, so when someone afks for a certain amount of time during game the game just ends and counts as a remake. I would think that since in the new season losses wont count against you why not make more remakes  then if that even matters just an idea please get back when you can. {{champion:142}}","replies":[{"poster":"Bazerka","date":"2018-09-24T16:48:17.309+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"One question for you: How do you differentiate between players that were genuinely experiencing network issues (aka the AFK wasn't their fault) vs purposeful AFK's.

I understand that if their internet cuts out and the player gets banned or punished that is a huge pain and shouldn't really happen, but that is a different topic. Regardless of the reason they left, the rest of the players on their team shouldn't be punished with an LP loss. After all it is nearly impossible to win 4v5 against a competent enemy team.","replies":[]},{"poster":"red panda z","date":"2018-09-24T22:57:25.939+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kinda on this topic, but if you think about real-world crime and crime prevention, there's no real way for us to actively prevent crime entirely. We can punish an offender and stop them from committing future crimes, but someone almost always will end up getting hurt first. It sucks to lose because of rage quitters, inters, and trolls in general because at times it can literally make you feel powerless. I don't think there's any perfect way of handling the situation, but here's an idea that admittedly has some flaws but might also proc some ideas.\n\nI call it the \"Mercy\" system.\nWhen playing ranked, winning teams have the opportunity to award Mercy to individual players on the opposing team, kinda like when you could honor your opponent back in the day. If you have been offered Mercy by 3 or more opponents in the game, you're offered a loss forgiveness that you can only accept once every X amount of games (say 15-20 games?) If you've already accepted mercy in the last however amount of games, you don't get the loss prevention.\n\nIt's fairly obvious to both teams when someone's inting/trolling/or just left. Many times, people all chat to ask other players to report the inter/quitter anyway. You'd start seeing \"Yas just bought all tears and is running down mid. Please report and mercy.\" Maybe some more conversation is added, but most people are pretty understanding anyway.\n\nThe system wants to make sure 3 people mercy you so it's not a fluke, or one person can't just go around mercying everyone left and right. The number could also go up to 4, but I think asking for 5 might be too much since some people just leave immediately and don't stay in the post game chat. The fact that you also can only get the benefits of mercy every X amount of games also is there to prevent exploitation, as you really shouldn't encounter inters/trolls/and quitters that often. It would undoubtably happen still, but that just goes back to the lack of perfect crime prevention IRL issue.\n\nI don't think it's perfect, but it might be worth bringing up in a meeting to maybe encourage some brain storming.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheSingularity","date":"2018-09-24T22:12:34.053+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Firstly: Make it so remakes require only one yes vote (there are no circumstances where one should continue past that time 4v5)\n\nA common trend would be players who are doing well or are in a game for a prolonged period, who would likely be DC'ed\n1. Check kill feed of them (are they inting or destroying)\n2. kill feed of team mates (is someone else inting, eg did they RQ because of team mate)\n3. Check resources: drakes, turrets, gold, baron/herald. If they're drastically behind, so none vs all they may give up and leave. But in reverse there'd be no reason to leave.\n\n\nTo rage quit when ahead is unlikely unless the rest of their team is trying to throw. So if they randomly happen to DC, chances are they lost connection or had a real world incident that needed attention, which they generally take the time to explain.\nBy then scanning the games chat logs as:\n1. A majority of AFK'ers announce that they're going to AFK\n2. They're generally badly behaved leading up to it\n3. Or their team harasses them until they've had enough\n\n\nCould also open up a ticket appeal system, where if there's a power/internet outage and they can find record of it on company site, they can send in a ticket with said resource specifying the outage and game they dc'ed, and if it's compatible the penalty is removed and reset (so their next DC/afk doesn't punish them greater)","replies":[]},{"poster":"DrCyanide","date":"2018-09-24T17:14:19.328+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> The hard part is we don't want to punish people for problems that are out of their control, but we have no way to determine that.\n\nCould start with the obvious solution - don't punish people when they manage to fix a problem that was out of their control.\n\nRight now there's zero reason for someone with a HDD to attempt to reconnect to a ranked game. By the time they reboot their computer and manage to reconnect they're marked as a Leaver, and will **lose** LP *even if they help their team win.* Them being gone from the game and having an up hill battle is bad enough, no need to say \"Yeah, you should have just given up on that League match and gone to do something else instead of spending your time trying to win.\" Even if you think they don't deserve the LP gain because they might have rage quit, then give them +0 LP on a win, not -18 LP on a win.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ERY Loken","date":"2018-09-30T20:40:39.069+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why not impose a system similar to Overwatch when a player leaves? … if someone on your team \"leaves\" despite connection problems or not, then we should be given the option to quit with no change in LP position.

But  the matchmaking algorithm should naturally respond to the event anyways. \n\nI understand Riot's stance of \"don't want to punish people for problems that are out of their control\" but you're looking at it from the point from the player whose disconnected and not the remaining team members. The stance is looking at the punishment of that disconnected player, when it should be focussed on compensating those who have suffered from the intended/unintended actions of the disconnecting players.\n\n\nI don't understand why Riot says its not an easy solution - other games have made it pretty straight forward","replies":[]},{"poster":"Muxxik","date":"2018-09-24T17:22:37.593+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As others have already stated here, the potential for abuse here is too high to allow this sort of system.
