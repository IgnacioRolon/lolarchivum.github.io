As the kind Rioter had said, if you are active at the time of the event, then you will be able to get the skin in some way, shape, or form. You had the chance to possibly be active for the event. Although make sure to be angered by Riot rewarding active members of their community, shame on them right?","replies":[{"poster":"SnugglePuggle94","date":"2016-05-17T01:10:03.700+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"Ahem.

So it'd make sense that you complain about victorious skins especially. Seeing how you simply go to blame your team for your own mistakes, and refuse to improve. Again, with the limited availability skins, you could have possibly been active during the time. Also again, it is their way of rewarding players who are active. You chose not to be active by not playing the game at the time of those events. I'm not going to argue with you further if you're simply going to be ignorant. Not sure what I'd expect from a player who blames everyone else for their own mistakes though.","replies":[{"poster":"SnugglePuggle94","date":"2016-05-17T22:46:30.741+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Excuse me?! I do not blame others for my mistakes. But of course you are just like all the typical high elo players that attack others for their low rank. Not all people in bronze are complete shit so stop attacking them.\n\nI only joined last year. I might think that Riot's policies are complete crap but I don't blame others if I did something wrong in the game. \n\nI have played during the time the limited skins were available, but I still see how others who joined later could not get them since the time had passed and they have to wait until they come up for sale again, which can be months. So I feel for them in a way as from what I remember I missed some really good ones. \n\nAs for the Victorious skins, that's my own opinion. I think the policy is complete bullshit. It still doesn't mean that I'm a bad player or I refuse to improve. If you actually looked at my stats you would see I got out of Bronze, then got stuck back in it during placements. Right now I just refuse to play ranked because of the awful balance the game is in.\n\nAnd finally, don't ever attack someone for their rank again. It's disrespectful and mean. And if you try to attack me again, I will not reply to you. You will only get downvoted and reported.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Dr CZ","date":"2016-05-17T07:20:44.742+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"@.@......so in this case, do you guys have a plan for players who already have all  unlitmited skins?
