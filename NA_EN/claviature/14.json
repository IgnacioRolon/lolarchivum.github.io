A chicken is a bird.&quot;\r\n\r\nI didn&#039;t argue with her after that because, y&#039;know, I hate dealing with other people&#039;s bullshit. But, a blackbird eating some chicken is the same as a person eating some beef. A human and a cow may share a class, Mammalia, but once it gets more specific in classification, they branch off into totally different areas. Same goes with a blackbird and a chicken. Or a fox and a rabbit. Or a ladybug and aphids. Yes, I do agree that wild animals eating humans&#039; leftovers can be bad for their health and their survival, but please understand why something is bad with the right reason.","replies":[]}
