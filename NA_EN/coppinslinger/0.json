What about junglers with a lot of lock-down who can LITERALLY beat on somebody for the full 6 seconds? You'd never expect that would you?\n\nJunglers like {{champion:54}} and {{champion:111}} who already rely on auto-attacks for their damage (Nautilus Sheild and Root, Malphite W steriod and Sheen procs if you go Frozen FIst) can abuse this item combination to make them high-threat targets in team-fights, and potent duelists in skirmishes. Not to mention the 20% damage reduction makes you basically UNKILLABLE when you are already building nothing but health and resistances. This helps take the edge off the insane late-game scaling that ADCs have.\n\nMoreover, with the new exchange system, you don't have to sacrifice {{item:3713}} either! Just buy Rangers and {{item:3067}} early on, and farm up your jungle, and wait till 15 minutes or so when your base-damage starts to fall off, and you no longer have a problem clearing your own jungle. Then switch to {{item:3717}}! There is literally no downside! Since you aren't going damage anyways, delaying your jungle upgrade isn't really stopping you from hitting a power-spike that will be game-changing in the early game.\n\nJust to give you an idea - the max damage at level 11 is 360 (TRUE DAMAGE) over 9 seconds. at level 18, its 486. That's a massive amount of damage tied up in somebody who is already incredibly tanky and is also getting 20% damage reduction. Even getting half that amount and adding 200-300 extra true damage to your combo is disgusting for a Tank.\n\nGood Luck out there on the Rift fellow Summoners (RIP Lore)\n\nHere's some amazing games I had (I don't even know how):\n{{champion:111}} \nhttp://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/1712429967/204508178?tab=overview\n{{champion:54}} \nhttp://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/1711278982/204508178?tab=overview\nhttp://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/1710891549/204508178?tab=overview\n\nFun as hell to play!","replies":[{"poster":"Summonerrr 1","date":"2015-01-28T11:31:24.084+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":1,"body":"An interesting stratagem.

It was explicitly written that the main problem was \"getting a few kills off of an early invade allowing a jungler to upgrade their jungle item before camps even spawned and snowballing\" the lead hard.\n\nI'm sorry, but if anyone got \"a few kills... before camps even spawned\" and was able to base and buy and get back to lane without missing cs (as starting your clear a minute later is also a disadvantage) they'd dominate even harder in lane. I mean, have you ever given up first blood before level 2 against a good opponent? You'll get zoned for the rest of laning phase. That's off of one kill. Imagine now if they got a few (3?) kills before lane even started. \n\nAt least when it's the jungler, the opposing jungler isn't prevented from playing normally and lanes won't die to ganks if they ward intelligently and play safely. Which, if the enemy jungler is 3/0/0 and you're level 2 in lane, you probably shouldn't be extending (not to mention you should still have flash if they do show up, and they're still not going to be able to dive you, AND the extra machete stats are only going to help them clear not help them gank).","replies":[]},{"poster":"coppinslinger","date":"2015-01-28T11:40:16.147+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Take AS Quints and Blues\n\nTake 9 in offense, going for AD and AS. Sacrifice 9 in defense if you really need it for potions in utility. 9/21/0 or 9/12/9 or 0/21/9 or 0/17/13 are all great set-ups to increase your clear \n\nTake AS reds (or maybe some armor quints/reds) if your clear is still unhealthy. Hybrid pen is usually better IMO for fights later in the game, but still helps your clear.\n\nSuddenly, your clear is much improved! In my experience, taking a set-up aimed purely at clearing the jungle has 0 disadvantage for champs like {{champion:113}} {{champion:32}} {{champion:111}} {{champion:54}} {{champion:33}}. You aren't going for high-pressure early anyways, and all you want to do is farm past your crappy early game.\n\nFun-fact, AS is one of the most expensive stats in the game, and you can get a massive 24% from just Quints, Blues and Masteries (or more from marks).\n\nSeriously, tanky Junglers are seriously underrated because nobody wants to do the experimentation to find the best set-up with them and just lock themselves into the strategies that work best for AD bruisers like Lee and J4 instead. I can usually clear the jungle till level 5 without backing and get level 6 before 7 minutes on tanky junglers by taking the right jungle pathing and set-up. This is WAY faster than the enemy jungler will and about the same-time as your solo-lanes. Literally rockets you out of your early-game weaknesses.\n\nThe 100g increase is highly exaggerated in its impact.","replies":[{"poster":"junglerboy16","date":"2015-01-28T14:00:38.561+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The only issue with using AS runes on a tank junglier is that almost all of them have horrible base AS, which means that even though AS is the most expensive already, as a tank, you get a fraction of the benefit that most other champs get. Nautilus has a measly 0.613 base AS, while some carries have around 0.67 and more. That is a big deal for using AS runes since you get so little out of it.","replies":[{"poster":"coppinslinger","date":"2015-01-28T14:11:23.743+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I understand that, but what would you take instead?\n\nNautilus's biggest problem is that he clears slow as hell, and takes too long to get to the point where he can start influencing the game in a substantial manner. After he gets to the point where he can start making plays/tanking/cc-ing, then there really isn't a problem. You don't play him for damage, so you don't need to build damage. You don't need to take more tank stats in your runes, because you already get enough from items. The only thing you need to do, is shore up his early weaknesses.\n\nIn soloQ as a Jungler, you need to have as much of an impact on all your lanes as possible. The earlier you can start doing that, the better, that is why Lee and J4 are so good right now. If Attack Speed gets you to that point where you can start influencing lanes the fastest, then it's still optimal, even if you don't get AS much value out of it as other champions.\n\nComparatively, its still better in my opinion. The difference you are talking about is 0.057 AS. Which means you are getting 0.01368 less AS compare to other champions with 24% AS set-up. That's 1 less attack every 100 seconds. Not noticeable enough to make the AS runes HORRIBLE on Nautilus.","replies":[{"poster":"junglerboy16","date":"2015-01-28T16:09:27.377+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, I guess you're right.

Taking AP and Mpen on somebody like Nautilus doesn't really give you better combat stats early-on... Your scaling (and base) is pitiful and your cool-downs are massive early on. You'll get more damage by taking AS in an early 1v1. \n\nAlso, you'll want to avoid a 1v1 in the first-place. This is easy to do if you take the proper precautions in jungle pathing and using your trinket at the right times. Also, AS means you clear camps faster and healthier. Since you want to run away from any 1v1 3 and pre-level-3 then having as much health as possible is advantageous to this. \n\nMoreover, most AD invade junglers won't be able to invade you early on since they honestly take MORE damage in the jungle than you since they don't take AS (Pure AD isn't as great as AS). Thus they can invade early at level 2 (MOST). This hardly threatening. Especially if you are full-health lvl-3 with AS vs. Pure AD lvl-2.I honestly would NEVER invade now with the 100g increase on machete, because if I don't FB the enemy jungler, I wasted 2-3 minutes dicking around when I need to farm. The only thing I'd be worried about is an early buff steal (not a kill on you) or a small camp steal. That's not too hard to come back from since you clear the jungle like a boss anyways with so much AS.\n\nAlso, AS is WAY better than MR (on your blues) if you are facing an AD invade jungle.\n\n> 2) Having to go to a lane for whatever and then getting bursted by an AP Caster\n\nI take the Flat MR in the defensive tree and the Flat Armor for this reason. Not as much, but it helps. Also, Nautilus and Malphite both have 10% max health sheilds built into their kit. This effective health early-on also helps. Since you stack health early-game, you can usually just absorb the magic-damage easily (this is my experience). Moreover, since you clear the jungler faster with AS runes, you get more gold and levels faster, giving you more health and MR (you have scaling-MR). You can also buy an early {{item:3211}} if you need!\n\nThe only time I won't run AS blues is if I'm going against double or triple AP (or {{champion:60}}). But in that case I probably won't pick Naut or (especially) Malphite in the first place ;).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Messaiga","date":"2015-01-29T04:20:14.978+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sounds like a good idea for me to try on Skarner.
