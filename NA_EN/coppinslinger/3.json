However, after looking into the opinion of some big streamers like TheOddOne, Trick2g, and Nightblue (among other youtube/twitch personalities) it seems like Ranger's Trailblazer is by far the favorite pick of upper-tier jungle mains.\r\n\r\nTo me, this is rather disappointing. Riot introduced these new items to introduce new strategy and gameplay options in the jungle. However, this diversity is only achieved when jungle items are relatively equal in strength. We can compare this to support items in the bot lane. Right now, the pick rate of the each item is relatively equal and there is a large diversity of sustain, poke, and hard engage/tank supports. \r\n\r\nDo you guys think Trailblazer is really that dominant? Does this dominance limit strategy in the jungle significantly? Or is it just another start of season fluke that will be ironed out like Warmog's, Targon's (remember when 4/5 people on team would build that?), and Black Cleaver? Or is this just going to be another failure of promoting jungle diversity by riot? The new spirit stone in Season 4 definitely introduced new junglers, but it quickly became obvious that only junglers that could abuse elder lizard effectively rose to the top (I'm looking at you Leesin and Kha'zix).","replies":[{"poster":"TehNACHO","date":"2014-11-19T20:51:59.638+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I believe it has a lot to do with these players' play styles.

I haven't seen a single player recommend anything over trailblazer's or BUILD anything over trailblazer's. Out of the 4-5 games I've seen of Nunu jungle with the preseason changes - everyone has opted for trailblazer's. Nobody built the counterjungling item on THE counterjungling champion.\n\nWhat's the reason for this? Trailblazer lets you clear both yours and the enemies jungle faster. It basically means you have the option to conterjungle quickly (even more quickly than with Poacher's), but can still have increased sustain and clear power in your own jungle when invading is too risky. The item is just too good and too safe and doesn't punish failure to succeed in riskier plays the same way the other 3 items do.\n\nYou can still gank with this item, you can still duel, you can still counterjungle - but you don't NEED to do any of those things to have guaranteed gold income.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Rainbowgasm","date":"2014-11-19T23:31:54.969+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"might just be a \"Timmy\" thing like Nasus and Veigar's Q, and Karthus's ult.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ValyrianBlade","date":"2014-11-19T18:36:50.305+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Eh I disagree. \n\nI play hecarim as my jungler,  and to me I saw trailblazer as the best option (to go with all my aoe, and because hec has mana issues). Simultaneously though,  the other options were attractive too. \n\nI mean there are 2 options which really help you counter jungle me,  which is hecarim's biggest weakness. In general,  junglers are playing to help their lanes rather than themselves at the highest levels,  and trailBlazer does not help your lanes nearly as much as the champion-smite ones do. I wouldn't be surprised to see those options rise to supremacy on gank-heavy junglers. For now it's just too new and I think trailblazer is the easiest one to use well,  the others have harder to master opportunities and will take time to find optimal usage.","replies":[{"poster":"coppinslinger","date":"2014-11-19T21:41:22.458+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is a possibility. It definitely took some people time to adjust to champ reworks and the like too. However, when I look at trailblazer it just is TOO good (AOE damage on smite? Health and mana return (in a jungle that hits harder)? Stun to increase sustain even further? Reduced smite CD to clear faster?). Like REAAAAAALLY good compared to the other options. And its super safe too :/","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sir ArmaMalum","date":"2014-11-19T18:36:50.575+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think that's a legitimate worry, but I think the other options are strong enough in their own right. Trailblazer offers a very healthy clear with the stun and the slightly faster clear wit the AoE yes, but other others allow for CC for champions like Shyvana, fast clear an regen for AoE champs like Amumu and a downright amazing 1v1 spell. I'm sure one will be more popular than the others, but I'll blame that on the popular jungle champions at the time more than the items themselves.","replies":[{"poster":"coppinslinger","date":"2014-11-19T21:38:13.503+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I understand that the other options are \"good\" but they aren't great. Trailblazer's smite right now is basically an even better smite than the live one (same CD but splash damage AND stun AND health and mana return). I mean power-farming your own jungle has always been a viable and safe route, but this item just makes it a REALLY attractive option. Especially when that route is more or less low risk (your teammates can respond way faster than theirs to invades).\n\nWhat it really comes down to is that the other two items won't provide the same gold income. If you pick up Ranger's Trailblazer, you get a nice early game boost to gold generation as you can clear way faster than your opponent. AND since you have a lower smite CD you can pick up more of those juicy smite buffs than your enemy (faster clears and better vision control again).\n\nIf you pick up either of the smite champions items, then you are relying on killing your opponent to generate income. Moreover, if you smite a champion, and DON'T get a kill. You first lost some desperately needed return on your purchase, AND now have no smite to clear your jungle with. That's a serious punishment and makes these pickups risky. \n\nPoacher's knife just simpler doesn't provide the same income almost ever. Yeah the reduced CD is better than on Trailblazer and the extra 20g is good. But unless you a literally in the enemy jungle taking ALL of their camps, you'll get more gold just by powerfarming your own jungle (less travel time between camps, less money needed to spend on wards, less RISK posed by a collapse by enemy laners). Counterjungling  isn't really popular right now for the above reasons and an extra 20g (basically clearing a ward or killing one minion), isn't going to make it more viable.\n\nBasically it comes down to which option will give you the most gold. And Trailblazer provides you so much power in clearing your own jungler - an option that is more or less guaranteed and is by far the safest.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Fury and Emperor","date":"2014-11-19T18:46:34.173+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Same thing happened with trinkets and boot enchants.\n\nAnd really, the community doesn't really care.

Obviously when Elder Lizard was dominant (as it still is to degrees) the meta became focused around extremely high pressure early-game junglers that could utilize this item. Combine that with the conservation mechanic and the increased damage to monsters passive, and basically it made ganking junglers who could build straight damage extremely dominant (no tradeoff between ganking prowess for income and camp farming for income).\n\nAnd that's just how one item affected the jungle meta. Now look at top-lane at the beginning of season 4. The meta favored high sustain, duelist, slippery champions. Renekton and Shyvana - two champions that could stay in lane and farm for ages *while avoid high-pressure ganks*(Renekton with his  E and R for emergency tankiness and Shyvana with her W and R). The repercussions of the meta are widespread. And that's just one item.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ProfDrDeath","date":"2014-11-19T18:33:31.398+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"NA Junglers were never really at the forefront of the jungle meta...\n\nThat being said, no, I don't think it will be too strong. It certainly has its advantages (lower Smite CD, AoE damage helps single target clears), but the other items have similarily powerful effects:\n- Poacher's Knife increases the reward for counter-jungling, and enables you to steal a lot more Smite buffs.\n- Skirmisher's is what you take if you want to counter-jungle by taking your opponent's life, instead of his toys.\n- Stalker's is helpful for not letting people get away - but I'd argue that it will be the least used of the jungle items, as you only need it if you absolutely lack CC for ganking.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vore Monster","date":"2014-11-19T18:32:26.109+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Trailblazer offers AoE to jungle camps to allow non-AoE (Like WW) to clear faster in the lane.
