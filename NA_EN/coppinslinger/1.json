He didn't cry. He didn't whine. He didn't beg me for ganks (I'm jungler) and blame his teammates.\n\nHe simply said \"Sorry guys, I don't play mid, trying my best.\" And he played the game. He farmed the best he could under tower, he built first item Frozen Heart against the enemy Zed who killed him 7 times in lane. He grouped with the team and tried to make plays at important objectives.\n\nHe ended up being a very useful member of the team, peeling for the back-line, and helping us win team-fights. He ended the game with 252 CS, not a bad score despite going 0/7/0 in lane.\n\nAnd you know what? We lost, but it was a good game. Our top and mid did poorly, but they played as a team, and we had a few comeback fights. We *played the game* instead of raging at each other.\n\nSimultaneously, I had a Sona on my team. Our bot lane won lane despite multiple ganks. She did a ton of damage as support, and got many multi-man ults off. She was incredibly skilled at her role and champion. But you know what? She raged at the team everytime we made a mistake. She distracted herself and her teammates by typing long arguments in the chat box. Instead of focusing on the game, she was focusing on how bad her teammates were playing. We lost the game, and I'm not surprised. All chances of a comeback are ruined when your team is busy arguing with each other.\n\nWho would you rather have on your team?\n\nLet's just get this straight. Play the game, do your best, and have fun. If you aren't doing that, then you are a detriment to your team, no matter how fed you were in lane. You are ruining the game not only for your team *but for yourself.*\n\nIf we had more players with their head in the game, instead of on the scoreboard, LoL would be full of close, quality, FUN matches. So take that into consideration next time you want to insult your 0/7/0 Cho'Gath mid.\n\n**Edit:** After some thought, I realized that perhaps I was asking the wrong question. After all, you can't control who is on your team. What you can control is your own behavior though. I wanted this post to get people to consider why they actually play League and act accordingly.\n\nThe more poignant question is then: \"Who would you rather be?\"\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"DrCyanide","date":"2015-02-09T23:58:53.523+0000","up_votes":62,"down_votes":3,"body":"I'm 100% OK with humble, horrible, players on my team.","replies":[]},{"poster":"2pudge1cup","date":"2015-02-10T00:25:28.972+0000","up_votes":54,"down_votes":0,"body":"All that sona needs is \"cry me a river and put a ward in it\"","replies":[{"poster":"Remlap1223","date":"2015-02-10T06:57:25.137+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":2,"body":"{{champion:53}} FUCK YOU GRAVES.

I'll give an example, in this case what I could say to an overaggressive adc.\n\n1) \"Would you be willing to play a little less aggressively for a while?  I don't think this is working and maybe something else would.  Could we try staying close to tower for a bit?\"\n\n2) \"You are being too aggressive and it's making you die.  Stop it.\"\n\n3) \"WTF are you doing?  Stop feeding.\"\n\n\n1) is asking someone to do something instead of handing out commands from on high, and more than half the time this actually works for me.  The tone is also more friendly, which makes people more willing to listen instead of responding with whatever retort they were thinking of.\n\n2) is still okay, but it's less helpful, more confrontational, and has the ability to set some people off.  This actually works less than half the time when I try it.\n\n3) will make me mute you and then you've accomplished absolutely jack ****.\n\n\n\nSo.  Which is the most effective way to handle the situation? \n\n\nThe issue with league, and with a lot of the comments below, is that being confrontational as **** seems to be the standard.  \"Here is what you are doing wrong.  Here's what I'm going to tell you to do.  Now do it\" is not a way to get you what you want.  Sometimes people will listen, and sometimes it will have the exact opposite effect.  And you know what happens when people ignore your commands from on high AND THEN you start to get a little more abusive?\n\nThe game is lost.  .... That's it.  You are no longer acting as a team, so the game is lost.  Good day.  Have fun with that.\n\nEdit: While I'm here, this seems to be the flavor of the thread, so I'll give some ancedotal \"evidence\".\n\nI'm Teemo.  I'm also the adc.  I have know idea how to play any adc roles but that's just how life works when you pick last.  I have told my team that I have no idea how to play ADC and told them well ahead of time.  They were not willing to switch.\n\nMy lane partner is a Malphite.  Now I don't know how many of you know a lot about Malphite, but let me just say that Malphite is a much better top than support and the reason we had a support Malphite is because Malphite apparently is even worse at adc then support.  Go figure.\n\nSo great.  Bottom lane has no idea what to do in bottom lane.  What is the rest of our team like?  Well we've got an ahri mid that knows what she is doing.\n\nWe have a volibear jungler that would really rather have been playing top or mid but again that's how the slice of the pie goes I guess.\n\nAnd we had a Trynd top.\n\nThe opponents, go figure, were mostly counterpicks.  Because yeah.  That actually happened :(.  Go figure.\n\n\nSounds like a disaster waiting to happen right?  Well our opponnets surrendered at 30.  Do you know how?\n\nNo one yelled at each other.  Ahri and Trynd did there thing.  Volibear kind of did his thing but let me be blunt when I say this was one of those junglerrs who spends too much lane and not enough time in the jungle if you know what I mean.  The kind who really shouldn't be jungling but won't admit that.\nAnd poor Teemo and Malphite sit on tower for the first 15 or so minutes of the game.\n\nAnd an amazing thing happened.  Every one of our lanes struggled, but absolutely no one died for 10 minutes and no one yelled at each other.  Everyone did their best.  20 minutes in our team had 7 kills to 3 deaths.  (Real slow game tbh).   30 minutes in the enemy team just up and surrendered because we had taken 5 of their towers and they hadn't scratched one of ours.  The kill score was something like 28 to 15.  In the final chat, do you know what happened to the team that should have kicked our collective arse.  Well apparently, top and adc got pissed about 12 minutes in because despite their advantage no one was getting kills yet (despite some close exchanges).  When we got a slight advantage 15-20 minutes in, they started to yell at each other.  And by 25 minutes in the opposing side basically had 2/3 of their team muted.  Which had the side effect that they weren't really doing well in lane while we grabbed dragon a couple of times.  After grabbing baron at about 28 minutes in...... that was the end of that.  2 more towers fell and they surrendered because they didn't want to deal with each other.  And we got to listen to all of this from people yelling at each other in all chat because the opposing team really needs to know what you guys are cussing each other out with.  :(\n\nAnd that's my story.

I was supporting her and by level 3 I could tell she didn't play a lot of adc because she was missing cs, taking free harass, not following my cc, etc. Which is fine, it's not like I adc much either, but I could tell she wasn't going to be able to carry. So I politely asked the jungler to ignore botlane and make sure our Azir got fed out of his mind, and once midgame came around I pressured mid with the team so that MF could get caught up on farm by herself. Even though MF had a million unnecessary deaths, we eventually communicated what we needed her to do in teamfights (stand at the back and press R) and we ended up winning the game.\n\nI've also had games where earlygame goes amazing (jungle gives laners 4 kills and a dragon by level 6) only to see it thrown away because botlane is crying at each other. Sivir threatens to afk if she doesn't get a different support, so top tps down and sits in a bush while Nasus freefarms... like something out of a bad joke really.\n\nIt's possible to carry one 0/7 player if they do their best to let you carry.
