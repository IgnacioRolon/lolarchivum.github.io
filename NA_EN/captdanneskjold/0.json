It can be 1 minute or 30 minutes in and the game completely freezes my computer. Whatever was last on screen is now stuck there accompanied by a horrible buzzing noise coming from the speakers that sounds like a piece from a dubstep song. I have to hold down the power button in order to fix it. First started happening about 2 months ago and I have been troubleshooting ever since.\r\n\r\nSo far, I have reinstalled the LoL, reinstalled my drivers, reinstalled (reset) windows, and even (for unrelated reasons) completely wiped the HDD and then reinstalled everything. \r\n\r\nNot sure what else I can do. This happens regardless of the type of game ARAM to Ranked (which I stopped playing once the problem presented itself). \r\n\r\nAny suggestions on fixing it?","replies":[{"poster":"whathefuuu","date":"2017-06-04T15:58:08.825+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same and i have the same processor","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-03T23:03:25.552+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It really sounds like your entire pc is freezing up, which may not be happening from League actually.
