Yes it is horrible and discouraging to spend the early game hiding under turret, but the oppsoing team suffers in the end trying to survive without a tanky top champion.\n\nI do agree the mobility creep is dangerous with champions like gnar, but the frustration seeing Kalista top is in my opinion a low ELO symptom of how difficult players find the jungle and support roles inder the shadow of high burst damage and high mobility champions.","replies":[{"poster":"lojician","date":"2015-02-24T15:30:33.621+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Tanky top champions (unless they're some mao-esque tank with tons of cc and a huge defensive steriod) aren't even good lategame let alone important.

A rival ADC can smoke Kalista if they end up in a duel but that condition doesn't happen because they spend their post 10-minute spikes chewing up enemy assassins/tanks and doing cleanup.

In the ADC/Support bot lane meta, she is more or less bearable: there's no one that she can hilariously kite because ADC/supports either have ranged attacks/poke or have good duration CC.
