I'm fine with being cc'd by the other team but literally just having a teammate be able to click me and make me feel like i'm lagging out was one of the most disturbing feelings I've ever had in this game.\r\n\r\nNot kidding... as someone who gets anxiety about not being able to move... especially when I don't know why... having no enemies around and just freezing in place really freaked me out.\r\n\r\nPlease... just make it so I have to accept her stupid pact. I cannot express how disturbing that experience was.","replies":[{"poster":"Proelium","date":"2015-01-16T03:04:07.175+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I do understand I'm an outlying part of the community.
