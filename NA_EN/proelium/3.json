Ok, I guess I gotta explain it like I do to my sub-30 friends.\n\nWhen you are sieging you can still be safe from a melee range assassin such as fizz. It's called watching zones of control and hitting him with poke so he cannot engage. You whittle the team down safely and keep putting waves into their turret. It will add up and they will be forced to either back off or take a bad fight you can win. \n\nThe vision changes, really? K. Your support still has 3 wards plus a pink, your adc will have blue trinket plus a pink, your jungler can easily have trackers knife or sightstone plus a pink, and your mid/top should also have pinks. WIth proper preplanning that's MORE than enough wards. Also, for sieges, mid laners are typically core, since they have some of the best potential for waveclear typically, with adcs following suit. You need a strong siege mid and adc for it to work, which fizz isn't. \n\nIf you can't stay away from fizz as ezral or corki you have royally fucked up as is. Fizz is not an all powerful god, if you play your ranges smartly and land your poke you can prevent him from doing shit and lock him down. All it takes is preplanning instead of flashy mechanical outplays which everyone on the boards seems to want to do 24/7.","replies":[{"poster":"AninLegions777","date":"2016-02-10T21:42:19.098+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Again you are factoring variables not initially stated.
