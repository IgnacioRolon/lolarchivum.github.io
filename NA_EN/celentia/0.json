AFAIK it wasn&#039;t directed towards any of the random players, but there was a bit of salt and spam pinging between us due to the Bard flaming one of my friends earlier on. In my opinion, directed insults towards players are much more offensive than a random spammed macro written multiple times, so I&#039;d like to know why it was escalated immediately to a 14-day ban instead of a chat restriction. There have been times that I&#039;ve been extremely salty (D1 soloq does that to you) but this offense that for all intents and purposes wasn&#039;t even explicitly malicious is a strange moment to be punished for. \r\n\r\nI still wanted to climb to Masters this season, would it be possible to de-escalate this punishment?","replies":[{"poster":"Umbral Regent","date":"2018-03-17T23:31:57.224+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why on earth would you have a macro to spam \"kill yourself\"?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2018-03-17T23:33:37.864+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"deal with the consequences of your stupid decision.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Prandine","date":"2018-03-18T00:51:24.501+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Telling someone to kill themselves is completely unacceptable, falls under the zero-tolerance policy and gets a 14-day ban as the first punishment. This is the second time that I've seen someone here say that they have a macro just for saying kys, which again is a completely stupid and pointless macro and idea if you ask me. I would advise to ditch that macro and watch your behavior from now on because the next offense no matter how small will result in a permaban.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Get Ogre Here","date":"2018-03-17T23:40:29.426+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"You should know damn fucking well at this point that \"kys\" is ALWAYS a 14-day or permaban.

It's an opinion you're allowed to have, but acting on it can have consequences, as you have discovered.\n\n> this offense that for all intents and purposes wasn't even explicitly malicious\n\nThat you believe the phrase to be relatively innocuous does not make it so. Also, spamming like that would be considered harassment, regardless.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-03-17T23:40:14.833+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"I am just going to assume this is a troll post, and nobody is actually dumb enough to do this and then expect a special exception.","replies":[]},{"poster":"redniwediS","date":"2018-03-18T00:13:42.003+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Takes at least two offenses to get banned, unless you were an exceptional example of toxicity that required a human review, and was so bad that their only course of action was to immediately close your account.\n\nEDIT:  For those who think otherwise.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/ACZhFYu.png","replies":[]}]}
