I've noticed though, Okay. \n\nI took my computer to have a new cooling fan installed, 5 days later I got my lappy back but the person told me that they had 'cleaned out some programs that i didn't need', which pissed me off, wtf? \n\nAnyway, I go to log back onto my Legacy client (I've downloaded the beta before i had my computer looked at) and it tells me that there is an error running the patcher. I believe that the person may've deleted something pertinent to league. \n\nCould this be the problem and would running the troubleshooter through the home screen fix it or should i just uninstall and reinstall the client? \n\nAlso, some other funny things have been happening but I've been dealing with them. When I begin loading into game, sometimes (more than not though) ANOTHER league window will stay open, its the window of the lobby before the game begins loading, If I do not close that window out, my fps is like, 09 frames per second. When I close it its around 66-80 (what it normally is). \n\nThe beta client is buggy for me as well, I did receive an error message stating that 'some of the new bells and whistles may not work on my system'. BUT my 'system' is an Hp Pavilion Beats Edition 15-p390nr. That is about a year and a half old I would guess. Maybe 2 years max. That may be irrelevant but Idk. My internet connection is always fine as well, I rarely lag. \n\nThough my ping did spike to 8000 yesterday....lol.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-10T04:12:35.194+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We typically see this issue pop up if your connection to the League game platform is *poor* or *unstable*.
