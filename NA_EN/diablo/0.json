I live on the east coast and typically have around 42 ping. Recently my ping has went up and constantly sits around 60-70 and spikes constantly. I know this isn't a high ping, but it's almost double what it should be, and the in game effects are much greater than they should be for at 70 ping. I just now, repaired my client and the ping is now sitting at 100-120 ping...like what? If anyone could help me fix my ping I would be greatly appreciated, because there's nothing more frustrating than not being able to play your favorite game because of bad internet... I have a brand new Alienware and router, and when I ping a site or speedtest my computer the ping is low and consistent and my download is approximately 20mbs with 2-3mbs upload...","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-23T17:42:39.521+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There may have been a change in your network settings that's causing an issue maintaining a stable connection.  As a first step, I suggest going through our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to make sure your settings and connection are in order.  There could be other issues as well like how your ISP is routing to the game server, but I'm betting the guide will do the trick.
