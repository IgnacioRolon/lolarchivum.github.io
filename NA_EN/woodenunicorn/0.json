I have also tried these, and others, but I am still getting around 100 ms to 300+ ms in game, when I was getting around 70 ms. Furthermore, no one seems to have any more information that helps.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-06T00:49:06.400+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm glad to see you took some great steps to troubleshoot this issue so far. To get a better understanding of exactly where this issue is occurring, I'd like you to run a traceroute to our test IP. First, grab the network app [**WinMTR**](http://winmtr.net/). After booting up the app, plug **104.160.131.1** into the host field before starting the trace. After 5 minutes has gone by, export your results as text and paste them in a reply.\n\nLet me know if you run into issues.","replies":[]}]}
