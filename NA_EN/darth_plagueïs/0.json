I don't have any bans or punishments on my account because I got a key fragment 2 games before that one.

You are only able to earn mastery tokens when playing normal or ranked Summoner's Rift, so if you were playing ARAM, Twisted Treeline, or any of the rotating game modes, that is why you did not receive the mastery token.","replies":[{"poster":"Darth Plagueïs","date":"2016-07-26T17:56:23.714+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It was aram ...
