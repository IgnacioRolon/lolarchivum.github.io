When combo with mumu, J4 or Galio, it may do the job with style.\nIMO her main issue is this useless passive.\n\nIt's ok to make it work against minions else her laning will be too easy, but lategame it's just an unreliable mobility tools leaving her easy to catch at first hit.\n\nWhy is it not scaling with her levels? So level 1 you lose all MS bonus if you get hit once, but later you need to get hit several times to lose all the boost. \nIt won't make her able to escape Yasuo or Vi or whatever's good at chasing, but it would maybe work to flee from someone sometimes...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Orders","date":"2015-04-23T16:08:53.143+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Her ult's physical damage portion should scale off bonus AD.","replies":[{"poster":"YeezusOfNazareth","date":"2015-04-25T12:21:32.109+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ikr her ult deals no damage it is only used to secure kill at 100 health only lol","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"YeezusOfNazareth","date":"2015-04-12T20:33:06.832+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i wish riot power her up :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"DragoonRuin","date":"2015-03-28T18:55:30.407+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I kind of lost you in the formatting of your post, but you are correct.  Miss Fortune really needs some love to bring her up to par with other ADC's in the current state of the game.  She has so much potential to be a solid pick in the game, but her aged kit really needs looked at and updated to bring its power level up to what other ADc's have at the moment.\n\nNow, I really don't want them to just throw a Dash onto her, and make her Graves/Lucian 3.0...  I think that's a terrible idea.  BUT I really think riot could do some things to tweak her kit to give her a Niche Spot in the ADC market.\n\nStart off with making her Passive Not be broken by minions, give her the Garen treatment.  \n\nSecond tweak her kit to make her the split push bruiser ADC of choice.  She's already fast, Riot should capitalize on that gameplay by updating her E, so the slow applies for the full duration for anyone hit by it.  And make her a little beefier so she fits into a split pushing role.  \n\nAlso do something wth her ult to make it worth casting.  As it is, once you reach 4 items or so, it actually starts doing LESS damage in most circumstances, AND it makes you a sitting duck for 2 seconds if you channel the entire cast.  I really Only find it useful for securing kills in the laning phase from 6-10'ish.  That's not a good place to be for a toon's Ult.\n\nCome on Riot, comment here and give us some feedback on our favorite Pirate Hunter.\n\nOh and bring back her Pirate buff.  \"Yarrrrgh I'm a pirate hunter!\"","replies":[{"poster":"YeezusOfNazareth","date":"2015-04-12T20:32:10.993+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ikr please riot if you care about your fans :)","replies":[]}]}]}
