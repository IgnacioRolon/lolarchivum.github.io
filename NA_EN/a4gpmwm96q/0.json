Did they know he heard them? Do they realize who he is? Obviously not. These are just more bodies to add to the piles. \r\n\r\n_Pat pat pat pat._\r\n\r\nIt would be so easy. All he had to do was turn around...\r\n\r\n_Pat pat pat pat slosh, pat pat pat._\r\n\r\nMaybe he could... They&#039;re practically begging for it. \r\n\r\n&quot;Stop running and surrender!&quot; One shouted at him. Yes. His mind was made up. In one fluid motion, he spun around to face his pursuers, procuring the blades from his sleeves. \r\n\r\n**They did this. This was their fault.**\r\n\r\nHe threw the blades with a wrist flick, 3 stacked upon one another. Using his thumb and forefinger to release them at different times, something he had practiced millions of times. No, not practiced. Practiced insinuates that there was a time when his movements were not deft. Were unprofessional. He is a professional of his craft. The three blades spiraled out in different arcs toward the 4 men he counted. \r\n\r\nThey must have patrolled these streets hundreds of times. Every night, catching petty thieves or even just mild complaints. Chasing shadows in the dark. These pitiful guards, returning to their families every night, for a good rest. This is what man takes for granted. This is the luxury he will now deprive them of. \r\n\r\nTheir bland, routine acknowledging expressions quickly turned to one of stunned surprise, and then to one of realization.  The rain continued to fall, even harder, as if competing with the blood draining from the now lifeless guards. They never had a chance. He knew it. \r\n\r\n&quot;Noxian guards, always chasing shadows.&quot; He muttered to himself, continuing on his way. &quot;To bad they found The Blade&#039;s Shadow.&quot;\r\n\r\nHe didn&#039;t know why Katarina wanted to meet him at such a ludicrous place. However, she wasnt one who was to be argued with.","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2015-08-28T16:10:39.897+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like it.
