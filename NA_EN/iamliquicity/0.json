Which he stood in lane went invis and did nothing. Its a bit tilting after he inted 3 kills and fed botlane not even 10-12 mins in. In this time i had my entire team sit there and say i was feeding but had yet to die, playing pyke support. In this game i was called a r%%%%%(which i have disabilities so i dont take too kindly to it) and i shot back with a few things, then after repeatedly being told i suck weiner and trying to counter the flame that was coming my way eventually gave in to the full tilt and tried to make light of the situation and defend myself. I had a teammate say i said the N word and he all chatted for the other team to report me as well. My other teammates chimed in as well. So after my whole team flaming me and i understand what i say is my own actions and could have muted them but its more upsetting i received a perma ban for this. Yet the people that flamed me first and all get to still play after the offensive language used. Now mind you i tried to defend this teemo giving him the benefit of the doubt. I received 2 tilt proof honors and a gg, but yet the adc reported me for unsportsman like conduct. I feel riot has made a mistake. I know most perma bans dont get overturned, but i had been playing alot to try and get my honor level back up and not be ome of the toxic people in this game cause leta be honest its not fun to play a game where people talk trash constantly, it reminded me of a mw2 lobby, if most of you played console games back then.","replies":[{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2019-07-24T12:36:52.949+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":">...and i shot back with a few things\n\nThis is the problem.

Ive played a lot of ranked and thats all i do, im not the best, but i dont like to lose. Ive played with extremely toxic people, and still communicated to win the game.

This is a 100% effective method. Flaming back is a 0% effective method that also constitutes unacceptable behavior and thus opens you up to reports and punishments.
