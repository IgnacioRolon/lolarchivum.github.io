It always makes me happy to see someone justifiably banned and this would eventually make matches have generally higher quality and shorter queue times.","replies":[{"poster":"Big Lincoln","date":"2017-01-05T01:36:53.691+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dodging isn't a problem.

I don't need someone who's forced into a role after dodging to avoid that role in the first place and then playing on tilt.
