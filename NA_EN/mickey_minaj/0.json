Since the updated items and trinkets (which i love by the way) it seems as though Teemo&#039;s {{champion:17}}  mushrooms are detonated by the destruction of wards. What i mean is that now since after a ward&#039;s timer runs out it leaves behind the little reminant that shows players where it was. If my mushroom was nearby when the timer goes down the mushroom detonates. At first I thought maybe it was just an invisible champ doing this but it happened more and more to the point where now I have to deliberately place mushrooms where wards are not and also ask my team not to place wards where mushrooms are. It&#039;s a hassle but if anyone has an idea of how to avoid this glitch or bug or has any information at all or is having similar issues, please let me know in the comments below. Thanks.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-11-18T21:14:54.780+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Skootarius! \n\nThanks for taking the time to report this.
