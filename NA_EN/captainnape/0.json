Don't tell me to reinstall the game I formatted my computer and reinstalled the game 3 time still doesn't help. The rate of crashing has decreased update after update but it still happens and sometimes I just don't load into the game and sit on a black screen until i restart the game.\n****\n_This happend after my team remade the game, just as I joined._\n_If there is anyway you could help that would be greatly appreciated._","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-20T17:01:27.297+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The black screen you are experiencing may actually be due to your network having issues connecting to the game server, and not something reinstalling might resolve.
