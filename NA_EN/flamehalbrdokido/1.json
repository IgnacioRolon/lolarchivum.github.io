These articles held VITAL information for field guide that is not accessible from the League universe page, you must know what your looking for to even have a chance of finding it. The same goes for the promotional Piltover and Zaun pages.\n\nThe idea is that there are floating articles out there will may hold important information but are not easy to get to, and example for Noxus would be ANY articles related to Sions update, including any teasers, and lore updates. These are old and won&#039;t all be connected, but they are the best (and probably only) example of disconnected articles featuring updated information on Noxus.\n\nFinally because Noxus has such a wide reach they are also featured in information pertaining to other Factions (Looks like i&#039;ll go have to read up on the Warmason featured in Piltover again, and lets not forget the names of the warships that I&#039;ll have to find again in one of the bilgewater stories, CRAP and ill have to at a minimum read Shyvana&#039;s new lore again looks like im dipping into Demacia too, but I thin thats it)\n\nSo of course I&#039;ll be reading all the Noxus Universe stuff again and doing my own search but some help would be much appreciated.\n\nalso people who gives the most information gets to pick the Noxus picture to be used in the final post\n\n{{sticker:draven-pose}} \n\ndisclaimer: i will seriously consider the chosen picture, but most likely pick it if its gud","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2018-02-07T16:40:01.464+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ooh, another of these!
