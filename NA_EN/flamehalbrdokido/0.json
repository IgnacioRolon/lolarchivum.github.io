This is a Comprehensive Zaun Dictionary/Field Guide. I have made this because in the midst of writing a story I found myself constantly looking for words/ terms and phrases from Zaun that I knew I had see before but had trouble finding them again. Here you will find most of the locations, groups, words, and phrases that give Zaun its character. I’ve made this for myself and for anyone else interested in getting to know more about Zaun. As always I appreciate any additions of suggested updates/changes to this Field Guide/Dictionary. The more we work together the better and more expansive this can be. I believe that every region deserves one of these tho. Having to make this makes me wonder if Riot has anything this developed for their writers, it really helps you keep track of everything.\nHere’s the link to the original post in which the issue was brought up:\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/story-art/cOE4UIr4-zaun-info-search-i-need-help\nHere's the concept and lore I'm doing this for:\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/FpUgUTE8-champion-concept-kaira-hopeos-endurance\n---\n#A\n**Academy of Techmaturgy** - Institution that feeds into the College Of Techmaturgy\n\n**Augmentation** - The use technological and/or chemical means to enhance or adapt human capabilities.

They've got the highest security, lest Sumprat kids dare think they can steal a clean breath from the rich and powerful.\n\n**Clean air** - A foreign concept to Zaunites. Down in the Sump, the air has texture, but getting higher, it has a sharp clarity.\n\n**The Cliff** - The most important location of all of Zaun, it was once the epicenter of a massive man made geological disaster that sunk most of the city.

A flourishing hub of cosmopolitan commercial arcades, supper-clubs, recital halls,  joy houses, and “everything goes” type clubs, making it one of the most populated districts of the cities. It was also widely regarded by the people that lived and toiled there as the place where the real work of Zaun got done, where most of the city's trade and business occurs.

Velveteen fabrics in dark colors are draped over the parts of their bodies that are still flesh, while their metal arms and augmented legs are exposed. They are inspired by Viktor, but Viktor thinks they're idiots. Beliefs of the Glorious Evolved include: The body is frail, the machine drives people forward. The Glorious Evolved also celebrate the old Zaunite tradition of sacrificing something personal for Progress Day in the hopes the next iteration of invention would be better. They give their discarded flesh parts as offerings to a shrine dedicated to The Gray Lady wrapped in cloth or suspended in jars of fluid. Non-augmented individuals are forbidden to step foot onto their sacred grounds, but the Glorious Evolved often take in the sick, seeing the removal of dying flesh as a key to transforming a person’s life and faith through technology, Piltovan or Zaunite, the Glorious Evolved doesn’t discriminate. \n\n**The Gray** - 1.) The thick, burning chemical atmosphere. A by-product of the constant production and spread of chemtech industry throughout Zaun. The production of synthetic crystals initially created in Piltover is also rumored to be a heavy contributor to the Zaun Gray. Fatal to breathe where densely settled - It is believed to be the cause of the lung blights that afflict many Zaunites. At times when it gets thicker it becomes a constant chemical fog that makes every breath a battle. Most days, it’s thin enough to breathe deeply without coughing up something wet. Primarily originates in the Sump and disperses into plumes drifting upward. When the Zaun Gray grows thick, some say Janna blows it away. It gives off a chemical smell, like it could singe off your nose hair if inhaled too deeply. To Zaunite though air outside the city is thin and unsubstantial. \n2.) Dusk\n\n**The Gray Lady** - The holy patron saint of the Glorious Evolved.

Used to create exquisite artifacts that can be wielded by anyone, not just those few with a natural aptitude for the arcane. It harnesses the magical power contained within extremely rare crystals, and its power is limited only by the imagination of their users. It is capable of amazing feats, from powering machinery to creating beams of light capable of cutting the strongest steel. The process of crafting hextech is a closely guarded secret, and no two artificers work to the same methodology. As such, each item of hextech is a unique artifact of rare beauty, a bespoke creation that will likely have taken years to craft.\n\n**Hextech crystals** - Authentic and synthetic crystals. They power weapons, tools, and machinery. They can create energy on their own.\n\n**Hexdraulic Coveyors** - A mode of transportation in Zaun using chains and/or rack and pinions to descend/ascend, they are basically towering city-wide or semi-city-wide elevators.

Its ovoid shape, and curved topside are constructed of thick glass and an elaborate ironwork baroque latticework frame with ratcheting endless gears. At the top there’s wrought iron howling wolf, and a pipe that blasts steam whistles. It’s the primary Hexdraulic Coveyor for transporting crowds between the levels of Zaun and Piltover. Conductor’s voices are magnified by a  flexible speaking tube connected to a bell-shaped sonophone. The passengers of the Rising Howl are used to people hitching a lift upward.\n\n**Revelers** - People who is enjoying themselves in a lively and noisy way, often under the influence.\n#S\n**Sawbones** - Zaunite doctor\n\n**Shadowhares** - Type of native mammal species\n\n**Shared pipe** - exhaust pipes with intakes from more than one location, an experienced *ductwork maintenancer* can identify them by smell.\n\n**Shimmer** - a corrosive chematurgical waste substance that is popular among Zaun's rebellious youth.

Reaching the top of Old Hungry with all your limbs intact, cutpursing a baron’s man or playing knock-and-run with a stilt-walking sump-scrapper.\n\n**Accent?**\nloose familiarity as opposed to Piltovan affectation, though accents from many other locations can be found in both cities due to the fact that many merchants pass through.\n\n**Architecture:**\nMost of Zaun's structures are crafted from lattice ironwork, either forged in the many seething foundries or wrought from scavenged material discarded from above. Though there is brutal functionality to the bolts-and-rivets of Zaun's structures, its inhabitants still manage to craft breathtaking wonders. Many structures are build into the cliffs or extend from them. They create a lattice work building on top and around existing structures to create anchor points.\nChem-lights burn in bolted sconces and through creative use of colored glass, polished steel lightweels bring light to the depths. Other forms of street lights are Arc lamps and Chem-lumens.\n\n**Attitude towards magic:**\nExploit\n\n**Who controls Zaun?**\nIndustrial oligarchy\nChem barons are not the government, but they are in control of Zaun. There is no formal government. The powerful Chem-Barons keep a loose alliance that keep the city from falling into chaos. They are rich and influential, and if you disagree with them you might disappear. That makes them in charge, even though there is nothing official about the arrangement.\n\nReligious Related Info?\nJanna, The Glorious Evolved, The Gray Lady","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2017-12-18T20:15:22.633+0000","up_votes":32,"down_votes":2,"body":"Awwww yisss.
