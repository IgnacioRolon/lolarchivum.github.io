Ever since then, I've been experiencing huge lag spikes with FPS plummeting down to 5. I have fiberoptic internet and no other applications have been slow to load, so I don't think it's my internet, and I have never experienced lag/fps spikes like this - or really any, to speak of. \r\n\r\nI am doing a client repair and will restart my computer after, but is anyone else having this problem? I've not seen a red post or notification indicating it has been acknowledged as a widely occurring issue.","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-06-16T00:13:32.267+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I went ahead and double-checked and we aren't seeing any server-wide reports of drastically increased lag.  Unfortunately, drastic FPS drops and Lag spikes have very similar symptoms to each other, so its a bit hard to clearly identify as to whether it is a connection issue or a FPS issue.  In an effort to narrow it down, make sure to use our [Connection Analyzer Tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743-Connection-Troubleshooting-Log-Reader).  It'll take a health check of your connection and provide solutions if it detects any problems.\n\nFeel free to reply back and let me know if the issues persist!","replies":[{"poster":"Divine Hymn","date":"2016-06-19T03:59:59.977+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the response. It appears the issue was resolved with a client repair. Something must have bugged out when I downloaded the update.","replies":[]}]}]}
