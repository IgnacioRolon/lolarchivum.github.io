I'm not sure if it would work well, but I think its a good idea and can work better than the current system.  I'd love to hear your responses.\nEdit: We could also have something like Overwatch where people who leave enough get a severe xp bonus (75% if I'm remembering correctly) this does not impact their ability to get into a game or overall matchmaking times, so this could work better with the BE (blue essence) from leveling.  Personally, I would rather it be a low priority queue where you can still find a game, but it would put another player in a game rather than you and would subside after the given time.","replies":[{"poster":"Magical Player","date":"2017-11-08T03:01:27.639+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Would cause delay of games somewhere\nCould also lead to the prisoners island scenario?(im to believe riot doesn't go for this)\nMy thoughts :D","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-08T02:55:48.019+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Y'know, I wasn't actually aware that's how they handled leavers. It kind of sounds like a good idea in theory, but I'm definitely not the best guy to suggest this too. You should post this over on Gameplay to see what other players think about it!","replies":[]}]}
