I thought it would be a good idea to reflect a bit on a highly discussed topic in both the community and our design department in 2018: champions with “no weaknesses” or “overloaded.” So the first question is what do we really mean by “no weaknesses?” Many people have different interpretations so I’d like to define how we’ve been thinking about this problem and how we hope to avoid it more consistently in the future. \r\n\r\nDefinition of the problem **insufficient weaknesses** -> when a champion played optimally invalidates options for their opponents to proactively beat them or defend against their attacks, effectively leaving them with no clear vulnerability. \r\n\r\nWe have had a number of champions that have crossed this line over the years (Leblanc, Vladimir, Azir) and some recent examples (Irelia, Aatrox, Akali). \r\n\r\nAs part of our discussions, we’ve been categorizing common causes of no weaknesses, which tends to happen when a champion is overloaded with too many strengths. Generally most champions in the game should have 1-2 of these powerful tools but when you start having many more it means there's not much you're weak at:\r\n\r\n * Powerful reactive defenses (big shields, invulnerability, untargetability)\r\n * Very short windows of downtime (short cooldowns, spells you can hold for reactive plays while still being highly effective, ammo)\r\n * Many abilities with low or no cast times\r\n * Very strong waveclear or wave control\r\n * Fallbacks cover weaknesses too well - for example a “weak laning phase” champion that has tools to farm perfectly from afar\r\n * Mobility tools that don't have cast or target restrictions\r\n * Wall crossing abilities\r\n * Very high dash speeds\r\n * Range advantages\r\n * No early game counter matchups\r\n * Flex pick ability to avoid counters (matters particularly in pro play)\r\n\r\nFor all new champs and VGUs from now on, the goal is:\r\n**A champion has clear moments of vulnerability and is generally weak to a significant number of champions (roughly 20+) or a common mechanic (like hard CC).** \r\n\r\nSome good examples:\r\n\r\n * Darius is really scary in melee range but he still remains kiteable by most ranged champions\r\n * Blitzcrank can win a game with a single god hand hook but he is very vulnerable to poke and has a lot of downtime\r\n * Kayn is a flexible assassin type champ but his tools let enemies have some warning and allows him to be slippery but not have an out for every situation\r\n * Jhin seems to have some serious abilities beyond the average marksman (range, CC) but he is still obliterated by a large swath of mobile aggressors\r\n\r\nWe are integrating this new goal at the core of our future development but not everything always goes exactly how we hope it will. To better react to these types of issues if they come up in the future, we’ve added a few additional processes:\r\n1. Roughly 6 weeks after a new champion or big update we are dedicating some additional time to evaluate how it all landed and make mechanical changes (not just balance) if we see this or other problems. If we fail to fix a problem even after this we will have to try again with more significant changes. \r\n2. When we do see signs that this is the case (win rate increases dramatically with MMR, high pro presence with very low win rate in solo queue, no counter matchups) we will react first with an attempt to open up a weakness instead of reducing overall power and ending up with the same problems still present.\r\n\r\nWe recently took a few swings at fixing the lack of weakness issues on champions where we think we went too far (note this is all stuff we have already done). Mechanics changes can be a bit disruptive, so in the short term these champs might be out of balance, but we will follow up with power and numbers tuning to bring them back. A quick summary of what we hoped to achieve:\r\n\r\n * Akali - opening up more time to respond by slowing down stealth time, making her more  weak to poke in lane, and opening up more areas of safety for enemies under tower\r\n * Irelia - We want to maintain her high mobility and aggression potential while opening up vulnerability to magic damage and reducing her team fight utility\r\n * Ornn - Low-cooldown defenses on his shield were giving him too much safety and reliability in lane matchups and ganks\r\n * Aatrox - High sustain kept him consistently healthy and the 2 charge dash model allowed him to sit on one charge for an escape most of the time and also let him remove the Q dodgeability too frequently\r\n\r\nWe’ve had good success with pulling out a bit of versatility and rebalancing with more direct power in the past. To be clear this doesn’t mean removing all frustration, just creating clear openings for playing against these champs. \r\n\r\n * Zed - used to leave too little room for opponent responses but the addition of R reactivation delay and slowing down living shadow speed made him a much healthier and still extremely fun champ\r\n * Kassadin - the removal his Q silence and maintaining a weak laning phase created a better counterbalance for his late game power curve\r\n\r\nI’m very proud of the work we did in 2018 but we’re aiming this year to tighten up our consistency on making sure every champ has real weaknesses as we continue to deliver exciting and skillful new champions and champion updates.\r\n\r\nScruffy\r\n\r\nhttps://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/9.2.1/img/champion/Sion.png","replies":[{"poster":"Ęvelynn","date":"2019-02-06T18:09:38.322+0000","up_votes":199,"down_votes":28,"body":"yasuo literally has 5 of the things on that \"insufficient weaknesses\" list but he kept all of them....really?","replies":[{"poster":"Kurbeh","date":"2019-02-06T20:14:33.203+0000","up_votes":81,"down_votes":15,"body":"**1.** Powerful reactive defenses _(Yes he got that with his W, and he also gets a shield for some reason)_\n**2.** Very short windows of downtime, short cooldowns _(Q and E)_ and spells you can hold for reactive plays while still being highly effective _(W)_\n**3.** Many abilities with low or no cast times _(Q and E screaming for attention, W is instant and blocks even if cast at last second)_\n**4.** Very strong waveclear or wave control _(Q tornado, dashing around the minions)_\n**5.** Fallbacks cover weaknesses too well - for example a “weak laning phase” champion that has tools to farm perfectly from afar _(Q tornado to farm, free passive shield, tons of dashes, windwall to block harass, melee champion that covers ranged weakness perfectly)_\n**6.** Wall crossing abilities _(technically his ult and maybe in a few situations his E aswell)_\n\n\n**?.** Very high dash speeds _(his R is instant, does that count?)_\n**?.** No early game counter matchups _(No idea, which ones does he have?

And yet her win rate (usually) stays above 50%.\n\nAs assassins go, Katarina is exceptionally high counterplay. As mages go, Lissandra has multiple worst-in-class weaknesses stacked together. And yet both of them maintain fairly reasonable win rates despite their unusually high number of unusually punitive weaknesses.\n\nTaken together with your Yasuo comment, it seems like balancing strengths and weaknesses is an afterthought so long as the champ stats are fine in an ELO 98% of us will never experience. I think that justification is harming the game because at a fundamental level it means fun is less important than stats.\n\nI think that's misguided at both ends of the spectrum. Playing against Yasuo is rage-inducing. It doesn't matter that I have 4 years of annual recaps showing him as my most-killed champ or that my highest win rate is against him. On the flipside, it doesn't matter that I have a 56% average win rate in ~1000 ranked Zyra games now that she's too frustrating and inconsistent to enjoy. And that problem gets worse, not better, as you climb.\n\nIf the OP is about fun and fairness, you can't throw it out just because low-elo Yasuos int and high-elo players counter him. Or because Diamond+ players have teams that carry a low-damage Aftershock+Proto Lissandra. Or because Gunblade active is an overtuned workaround to layers of kit delays.\n\nEDIT: Perhaps a better point would be that there's a threshold where strengths and weaknesses can be too extreme within a single champion. Meaningful weakness is important, but so is reasonable strength. I think this might better express the issues with the 4 example champs I used.","replies":[{"poster":"Shahamut","date":"2019-02-06T21:21:33.681+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":13,"body":"I think what you need to understand is that from RIOT's perspective, \"fun\" and \"enoyabe\" are such abstract and subjective terms that it would be LITERALLY impossible to balance with that as the #1 goal.\n\nI for one, being a hard stuck gold player, have never had issues playing against Yasuo. Yes, I also have a fair amount of games played AS Yasuo, and I think that is almost always the big difference. \n\nPlaying a bunch of games as the character you hate playing against most will usually teach you how to beat them (if thats your issue, not yours specifically in this case) and also tends to lessen the frustration when playing against them.\n\nIn short, though, they have to use SOME kind of data to balance for the sake of consistency. Not that they are perfect, I wager no company is, but they are doing their best.\n\nIn Yasuo's case- He is niche pick at best in pro-play. RARELY has he ever been meta, except for the short amount of time that \"Frozen Force\" was a thing. Riot easily identified that it was the item synergy, not the champion, that needed changed and once they did, Yasuo fell completely off the pro scene for a bit.\n\nIn high elo, Yasuo's win rate is lower since people know how to play around him and exploit his weaknesses. Even in low elo, its not like his win rate is rediculous. He is just frustrating for a lot of people.\n\nPersonally, as someone who primarily plays melee characters... I hate Heimmerdinger. I tried playing several games as him and it just made me hate him more because of how easy he is to play as... XD But hey, thats  MY opinion. I certainly don't expect Riot to balance around my personal preferences.","replies":[{"poster":"Vekkna","date":"2019-02-06T22:47:06.282+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":2,"body":">\"fun\" and \"enoyable\" are such abstract and subjective terms that it would be LITERALLY impossible to balance with that as the #1 goal\n\nThat's true about balance in the bean-counter sense. The OP is more about design philosophy, though. And this philosophy is being set forth in the same patch that Zyra's plant damage is being nerfed and Phantom Dancer is getting a passive-proc shield that absorbs 171% of the magic-only Maw shield. \n\n>I certainly don't expect Riot to balance around my personal preferences.\n\nGood. Me neither. \n\nIt would also be nice if they made more balance decisions that consider enjoyment/frustration (which are measurable directly and indirectly) and some players below diamond. I'm not suggesting balancing only around lower elo (though they do this for some champs already), and Riot would say they already consider these things. In my opinion, it needs to be given more weight in their calculus because the enjoyment/frustration aspect feels like a snowballing problem.\n\n>\"Frozen Force\" was a thing. Riot easily identified that it was the item synergy, not the champion, that needed changed and once they did, Yasuo fell completely off the pro scene for a bit\n\nCase in point. Why is Yasuo a problem? Pro play. What gets fixed on Yasuo? The thing that impacts pro play. Meanwhile, he's sat on a 40%+ - 70%+ average ban rate (globally across all elos) for 2.5 years. Not once has he fallen below 40% ban rate since the introduction of 10 bans. Even in diamond+, he's barely slipped below 40% ban rate since Conquerer. That's actionable data - a large sample size over a long, persistent period of time. But Riot has been crystal clear that they don't think Yasuo is a problem. The only way I can explain that is if Riot just doesn't weigh enjoyment/frustration very heavily in their decision-making.","replies":[{"poster":"Shahamut","date":"2019-02-07T00:01:41.134+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Zyra and yasuo are VERY different champions, and I don't think its really fair to talk about their balance decisions in the same light given their different strengths and weaknesses.\n\nI can tell you though, the phantom dancer change is a nerf to Yasuo if he builds it, primarily because it shares its passive with Steraks.\n\nAs someone who plays Yasuo, I can tell you what my least favorite part about him is: Build diversity.\n\nHe is pretty well locked in to building the same items if he wants to succeed. Current changes pretty well dictate that if he wants to build PD, he will now HAVE to go zerker greaves or lose out on his Q cd for a longer stent of time. Wits end only recently became his one true situational buy vs a lot of AP, but that rush delays his crit chance, which he needs to build to work at all. \n\nI think Yasuo will be power neutral or maybe a small power gain this patch, but only because the PD nerf will force him into buying Statik Shiv.\n\nYasuo typical build (my prediction) will look like this: Zerker Greaves > Static Shiv > Agility Cloak > Storm Razor > IE/Steraks > Situational item.\n\nHonestly, I think the storm razor change is a mistake. There is literally no reason NOT to buy it if you buy Shiv/Rapid Fire Cannon.\n\nIf Yasuo does eventually see some changes, I hope that the changes will open up his build paths a bit more... Its honestly the worst part about him. (also one of his better exploits atm, if you can force him away from his core build, he will be that much weaker and easier to deal with. If he doesn't adjust at all, he pays for it another way.

Yasuo is popular with high play satisfaction, high enemy frustration, and checks most of the boxes in the OP. Zyra is historically unpopular with a low play rate, checks few if any boxes in the OP, and has a core playerbase whose champ satisfaction has severely deteriorated since season 7.\n\nIn short, Yasuo is widely *perceived* by opponents to lack meaningful weaknesses. As a result, he is frustrating. Zyra objectively has layers upon layers of weaknesses that negatively affect the quality of playing her, but she's still frustrating to play against anyway.\n\nThose perceptions and frustrations aren't addressed here because \"optimal\" means \"pro.\" I think that paradigm should be challenged. I think Riot can do better than this. I think it's a disservice to say that Yasuo is fine when his own fans can't even pick him in over half the games created globally.\n\nIt's just a shame to see a high-quality post like OP, then realize it doesn't mean fuck all for solving any long-term frustrations experienced by the overwhelming majority of players. No, this new direction is basically just a statement that Riot is going to pay extra close attention to how designs will impact the pro scene. It has literally nothing to do with us.\n\n>I can tell you though, the phantom dancer change is a nerf to Yasuo if he builds it, primarily because it shares its passive with Steraks.\n\nIt may be a net nerf, but my point is about frustration rather than just power. Here the frustration is, in large part, the fact that the stars have to align before a ranged mid can get any damage to stick. You have to poke the shield off, poke the bone plating off, and play around the Windwall cooldown. Then you have to win a fight without him dis-engaging with E or counter-engaging with QR. It's basically nightmare fuel.\n\nWhen he comes back to lane with PD rush, you now have a massive shield proc (with a hidden cooldown, of course) to chew through as well. That's akin to giving Vlad a sterak's shield on his rush item. \n\n>I think Yasuo will be power neutral or maybe a small power gain this patch, but only because the PD nerf will force him into buying Statik Shiv.\n\nMaybe? I think most Yasuos will continue to build PD and climb from the shield proc's ability to compensate for common mistakes made by low-elo Yasuo players. And I think his ban rate will climb into or beyond the 60s. That's just a prediction, but I hope I'm wrong.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"shabingi","date":"2019-02-06T18:29:05.196+0000","up_votes":41,"down_votes":3,"body":"does this apply to future certainlyT champions since almost all of his are some of the worst offenders?","replies":[]},{"poster":"FOR JUSTICE","date":"2019-02-06T18:11:21.633+0000","up_votes":25,"down_votes":18,"body":"First \n\nalso  wouldnt lucian actually fit into the list?\n\nhis only forseeable weakness i can see is him oom'ing himself, and the only thing i can see he would be missing is waveclear. same with ezreal. you cant exactly counterpick lucian because he's stronger then the majority of botlane picks right now tbh, and you cant really get close enough to ezreal to punish anything because once he gets under half, he can just farm with q.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Scruffy","date":"2019-02-06T18:17:54.197+0000","up_votes":45,"down_votes":7,"body":"Lucian is a bit OP right now but I think his worst in class range (500) gives him a clear weakness relative to other ADCs.

You often die before it could even go half it's duration.\n**One solution could be to let it reg faster.** Maybe 5 or 4 seconds instead of 6. Could be too strong in early laning phase; so maybe it could scale 6/5/4 seconds with Ulti upgrades.\nAlso/Or you could make it work with the Resolve Rune \"Revitalize\" (currently not happening because Reg not Heal). That would give Voli a bit more options in the Resolve tree while buffing the Passive a bit.\n\n---\n\n#2) Is there any chance to make W a bit more rewarding vs tanky champs?\n\nVoli's W has always felt unsatisfying vs tanky champs. Often you can't even finish them when they are VERY low HP. That's pretty disappointing for such a long CD ability. \nI know his new E 8% Dmg buff is for dealing better against Tanks, but his E shouldn't be stronger than his W in any case imo. Now it feels even more like a hot fart in comparison, considering that it has 18(!) sec CD and should feel like an \"execute\". \nBetter lower the 8% E dmg buff but for that give his W a CD reduction per upgrade and more dmg vs Tanks, so it remains his main dmg ability.\n\n---\n\n#3) Are there any plans to make Voli's Ult castable while moving?\n\nVoli is easy kitable and has problems to stick to his target. It feels really clunky and outdated if you chase someone but have to stop to cast your melee Ult.\nIt's just a little improvement and wouldn't affect his winrate at all, i guess, but it would make him less tilting to play in some situations.\n\n---\n\nI don't think that this would make his winrate go up but make him a bit more comfortable and fairer to play.\nAlso keep in mind that an unpopular champ with 2% pickrate (1% in Jungle) is only played by hardcore fans and otp's; so his winrate is a bit better as it would be since he is only played by players who are very experienced with him.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Scruffy","date":"2019-02-06T18:24:00.851+0000","up_votes":34,"down_votes":1,"body":"Long term we would love to do all of these.

Every champ is weak to hard cc. Being weak to hard cc is not champion specific, and its not a weakness, its a strong mechanic in the game. Also you think Jhin is in a good place because if he is matched against renekton he looses? All marksmen loose to mobile melee bruisers, Jhin is 99% played versus other marksmen though. But its only 99%, why would that be a factor to care about? You cant think so simply about weaknesses as you do here. The game needs to be focused on the compromises a player makes. You build a tanky item to get tanky, OR you build a damage item to get damage, if you want both you get less value. This would be clear tradeoffs that would immediately give every champ a clear strenght, and also a clear weakness. Unfortunately you make bruisers that build black cleaver and 4 tank items that can deal 2K damage on a single rotation. At the same time they have 4K health and tones of resistances. This would only be okay on champs that have no cc AND no mobility, as they will destroy anyone they can get their hands on, so it needs to be really really hard to get their hands on anyone. Introduce compromise to every champion. Get rid of tank/off tank/assassins this is not a healthy type of champ. Also get rid of abilities that are like yasuo passive, its super strong, to the point that its stronger than many normal abilities of other champs, and its just there to constantly give you exactly what you need all the time. \n\nAlso Pyke passive needs to be removed, completely. He is an \"all-in\" champ, that means unless you have a champ that is better at all-in(literally need to play a midlane assassin) you have to play around him by poking him out and never letting him have the all-in he wants. The passive you gave him lets him automatically completely negate that counter strategy against him. That now leaves you with one choice; NEVER even interact with him(essentially dont play). Then you gave him hook, stealth AND mobility so he can force fights anyway. See how you have eliminated every single playstyle against him? So you nerf his numbers until he is at about 50% winrate. Do you see how this creates that same kind of game that old Zoe did? you make ONE misstep and you are dead, and you are pretty much guaranteed to loose the game. If you get though laning while playing insanely passively and dont make any huge mistakes he is utterly useless and Pyke is now the one that is guaranteed to loose the game. Now you can be happy that you had a 30 minute boring game where nothing happened and you won later because their support is useless. you say you are actively working on this part of the game but its by far the worst part of league, and overloaded champs are everywhere, actually it seems that with time this problem actually grows and you make more and more un-counterable champs. \n\nI say it again, start forcing players to make compromises. Do I want to deal damage OR do I want to survive for longer? Do I deal little damage many times OR do I deal a lot of damage once? You have to make clear lines between this, so that you cant be the best of both worlds. Bruisers are like this, they get the best of both worlds. A carry that builds dead mans plate will deal considerably less damage. The same is not true for bruisers, at all.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Poolparty Sauron","date":"2019-02-06T18:16:06.609+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":9,"body":"I fail to see how Aatrox doesnt already have well defined weaknesses:\n-kitable\n-the squishiest juggernaut besides Mord(who is getting VGU-d into an actual juggernaut)\n-an increadibly basic kit outside of Q\n-weakness to being jumped on (SWORDS DONT WORK THE WAY HIS Q WORKS INGAME BTW)\n-no answear to armour stacking\n-limited mobility(even more so now)\n-W is extremly easy to just walk out of\n\nThats not even going into the low quality of his animations,his numerous animation bugs which havent been fixed SINCE LAUNCH(walking loop bug anyone),\nhis freezing autos, his literal missing joke animation and a recyled dance animation which causes serious clipping issues.","replies":[{"poster":"Support 4 Lyfe","date":"2019-02-06T18:27:48.936+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":10,"body":">kite-able  \n>has two dashes and his Q gives him mobility  \n\nlol ok","replies":[{"poster":"Miriakus","date":"2019-02-06T18:40:32.510+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":1,"body":"He doesn't have two dashes anymore and they are pretty short range.

Would u please consider reading it?\n\n-----------------\nSo, Zyra, one of my favourite champions in tje game, has some balance problems in SoloQ. And she also has the problem for not being a good midlaner. Many of Zyra players want to play her in mid, like myself, while many other want her to remain a good support. I have some suggestions to help her out in both without making her oppressive.\n\nSo what are Zyra's balance problems to start with:\n\n- Planets zoning control and poke damage even if Zyra misses abilities.\n- On the other sides planets late game die to anything and hence he damage falls off so hard.\n- Strong early and mid game duo to good base damages and low cooldown on her Q.\n- On the other side her late game has another problem in her low AP scaling. Her 2 damaging abilities have 50% and 60% AP scaling.\n\nSo after a lot of effort, I tried to come up with some changes to help her and make her a better champion that rewards more skilled players (Note: u don't all there r not meant to be applied together. If Riot considers this, they may take as many points as they wish)\n\n1st Path->  Reducing planets damage significantly from (20-100)+ 15% AP to (15-75)+ 12% AP and adding a new passive. Hitting an enemy with an ability marks them for 2 seconds. Marked enemies take 50 bonus damage from planets. This will get rid of the problem she does so much damage even when missing and reward players who hit skill shot with little more damage.\n\n2nd Path->  Giving her ult a new passive. Newly respawned planets r untargetable for 0.5/1.25/2 seconds. This will solve the problem of planets evaporating late game duo to any form if damage while untouching her levels 1-5 (level 6-10 half a second won't be problematic as well). Consider that Zyra late game is so bad because she has no form of peeling/protecting and without damage she is nothing.\n\n3rd Path->  Making her scale like a reasonable mage. Reducing her base damages on Q and E to end at 160 and 180 base damage at max ability level. Increasing the AP scaling from 60% and 50% to 70% each. That will hit hard when behind with little gold and AP while rewarding players who got lead into the mid/late game.\n\n4th Path-> Increasing base health from 504-1847 based on level to 520-2050. Reducing base armor to 23. This is a huge early nerf that will make her much more vulnerable to ADCs autos, AD midlaners damage and menions aggro. One the other side she will finally have the regular base HP of a squishy champion into the late game (most squishy ADCs and Mages have 2000-2120 base HP at level 18).\n\nI really wish some one at Riot actually considers these. I feel like applying some of these changes can solve most of her problems while making her more rewarding for hitting your skillshots.\n-------------------------\n\nI really wish u accept some of the community suggestions if they actually make sense.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ProfDrDeath","date":"2019-02-06T19:01:11.955+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":2,"body":"Hmm.

Only two combat spells with short CDs (12-8 seconds).\n- Many abilities with low or no cast times: Not really. Q has a cast time that requires stopping, and E has its animation. R is a short channel, but R2 is pretty much instant - although rather low impact on its own.\n- Very strong waveclear or wave control: No. Q is ok for that, but far from outstanding.\n- Fallbacks cover weaknesses too well: Not really. Seems sometimes more like the other way around - Quinn has few good fallbacks if she falls behind early.\n- Mobility tools that don't have cast or target restrictions: No. E requires a target and positions you relative to that target.\n- Wall crossing abilities: Yes, but rather limited - tied in with the point above.\n- Very high dash speeds: No. E is decently fast, but not outstanding.\n- Range advantages: Yes and no. Definitely has a big advantage over melees, but her range is low compared to other ranged champions.\n- No early game counter matchups: Depends on the champion pool. There are quite a few champions she struggles against, but players who favour a lot of melee champions will probably have few of them in their pool.\n- Flex pick ability to avoid counters (matters particularly in pro play): In theory, yes. In her few competitive appearances, Quinn has been played in (and won in) all three lanes and the jungle.\n\nHmm, overall, she seems to be within limits to me.
