The Summoner's Rift Team has a small but hopefully meaningful set of changes that we’ve been testing this year and are using going forward.\n\nNormal Play (Iron - Gold)\n\n* For both normal and skilled play, we’re tightening the OP line a bit after looking back at the full year (2019) and seeing that we trended towards buffs over nerfs. Ideally we find the right balance so that we don’t have power increase or decrease over time. \n* OLD: OP if 54.5% win rate if &lt; avg banrate, down to 52.5% win rate if >5x avg banrate\n*  NEW: OP if 54% win rate if &lt; avg banrate, down to 52.5% win rate if >5x avg banrate\n* For Example - Our new system flagged Diana for nerfs in 10.3 (at 53.7% win rate, 23% ban rate) which we would not have gotten from the old. \n\nSkilled Play (Plat - Master)\n\n* OLD: OP if 54% win rate if &lt; avg banrate, down to 52.5% win rate if >5x avg banrate\n* NEW: OP if 53.5% win rate if &lt; avg banrate, down to 52.5% win rate if >5x avg banrate\n* For Example - Our new system flagged Senna ADC as OP in skilled when the old system would not have.\n\nElite Play (Grandmaster - Challenger)\n\n* No changes at this time, but we’re working on ways to have a more game data driven system here. Our current usage of picks and bans is approximately correct, but we think that we can get a more accurate picture of champion balance with game data like win rates here. \n\nProfessional Play\n\n* Unlike Elite play, we think pick and ban data here provides a very good representation of champ power. We’re still tweaking this a little to reduce the amount of patch notes for pro during most of the year and then amp up our focus as worlds approaches. \n* OLD: OP if >90% presence for 1 patch or >80% presence for 2 patches\n* NEW: OP if >95% presence for 1 patch or > 85% presence for 2 patches. Increased focus for major events (worlds / MSI). \n\n\n**Widening the Jungle Champ Pool**\nWhen we’re digging into our results and follow ups from this year’s preseason, we were really struck by a problem in the Jungle role that we’d never been able to fix - throughout League's entire history, low Elo players have preferred the jungle position least of all 5 positions, regardless of whether jungle is strong or weak relative to the other 4 positions. We think this will take a variety of changes to fix in the long term, but we want to also do some short-term work to improve jungle appeal. In 10.4 we’re going to try adding a handful of champs that we (and you) love into the jungle pool. We’d be doing very focused changes that buff these champs' jungle clears but leave their lanes unchanged. Not all of these may ship but here is our current list:\n\n* Garen (we’re also doing some light changes to make bruiser items more viable compared to attack speed builds)\n* Diana\n* Zed\n* Talon\n* Darius\n\n**Soraka in solo lanes**\nWe’re working on some targeted nerfs to Soraka to prevent her from being a dominant pick in solo lanes with a pretty low quality gameplay experience. Her self healing pattern (Q) was built to be risky and semi reliable against ranged opponents, but in the 1v1 vs a melee it’s low risk and too hard to dodge.\n\n**More Aphelios followup**\nFew more changes should be coming for Aphelios in 10.4 to help increase the clarity playing against him, and overall bring him into a more balanced state:\n\n* Better understanding of his guns - We’re adding his offhand gun icon to his health bar\n* Less surprising Rs - We’re lowering the range on his R and amping up the color differentiation so that you can better tell when an R is coming and what it will do.\n* More clear turret threat - We’re looking into ways to make his turret visuals convey their actual high threat so that players react to them more quickly.\n* More balanced - He seems to still be strong even after 10.2 so we’re going to do another set of nerfs to put him into a better spot\n\n**Sunfire Cape Improvements**\nSunfire currently is a bit underpowered, giving us the opportunity to buff it in ways that improve the tank experience in the late game. Damage focused classes scale up with items in a way that speeds up and eases their farming patterns, while tanks still can struggle to clear even after multiple items. Our current changes in testing are:\n\n* Immolate burn is increased by 1.5% of the wearers bonus HP for 4 seconds after you apply an immobilizing (same rule as fiora W) crowd control to an enemy\n\n**Stopwatch**\nCurrently we believe Stopwatch is being used too often by a wide range of champions in a typical game. This leads to both a feeling of homogenous powers across every champ but also it can be too good at stifling action and negating burst. We’re looking into how we want to change/reduce its presence in the upcoming patches. \n\nScruffy\nhttps://twitter.com/MarkYetter\nhttps://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/9.24.2/img/champion/Sion.png","replies":[{"poster":"CensoredMercy","date":"2020-02-07T20:03:50.976+0000","up_votes":62,"down_votes":9,"body":"{{summoner:31}} Hey Riot Scruffy! I am  a Diamond 1 top lane main who has reached Diamond on every role and I have loads of questions I hope you can help me with. If, or more hopefully when, you respond please know I take this very serious and hope to have a enlightening conversation (I am also VERY open to talking to you, on my stream or off!). I know this is very subjective so I am very open to any suggestions, please do keep in mind though I am trying my best to represent the general opinion in the higher MMR community right now. Here are my main questions:\n\nJG may not always be fun to play for the Jgler itself; but as were seeing the game move towards more tighter games and therefore early game being all the more important it feels to the lanes that a large portion of their lane is decided by Jg. How will this be remedied if ever? How are we going to make it so the laners like to play vs Jg and the Jgler themselves enjoys it? \n\nRANGED TOP PREVALENCE. Top lane has been in a very weak state for a long time, and at this point, especially after jg buffs, there seems to be little reason to play it. It isn't even fun (Diamond 1MMR+) because it is just RANGED tops (Edit: There has been an unprecedented amounts of ranged tops the last couple of seasons, though I did not literally mean it was just ranged tops. That was a hyperbole. It has become very frustrating to play against these champions though especially with the sentiment that many top lane mains originally chose the lane due the exceptional fun 1v1 experience you would get in many melee match ups.) Will this ever be combated?\n\nMany armor tank items are weak yes, but the Magic resist options for bruisers and many others aren't just weak but usually impossible to build. Not only this, their armor counterparts are far superior in terms of efficiency and what they build into. An example of this is Hexdrinker vs Seekers and MAW vs Hourglass. Will there ever be balance changes around this?\n\nZhonyas hourglass has become a extremely forgiving item in its build path and its completion. It is worth far more than what it costs, and this is clear to every player playing in D1+. Will Zhonyas ever be changed? Seekers also was originally a great item for mages to build vs Agressive AD mids that would overkill them and have extreme kill pressure, but with the fact that currently AD assassins are unfavorable (with the rare exception like Qiyana, and Talon in higher SoloQ due to the disorganization of SoloQ and his roaming potential), and have been for a while are there any plans for this item to be nerfed? (Especially since its common among top mages to just sit on this and stonewall and win vs their laners.)\n\nSupport has gained a lot of impact in the laning phase, and nowadays have high amounts of damage in the laning phase. This is only a part of the reason that ADC is frustrating to play. This may only be one of the problems concerning ADC's and maybe not even the main one, but fixing this may make ADC's have more control over the laning phase and return supports to being ADC centric in the laning phase as it has been in previous seasons. Is there any plans for this to return?\n\nMages are in a very good position in the meta right now, mostly due to their item choices. They are given CDR, Defense, and damage in many cases in a singular item (Zhonyas is a great example!). Not only this, but many champions also have the option to spike much faster than their enemies, which is prevalent in the top lane with the item \"Hextech Protobelt\". Are there any plans to change or maybe nerf/change/rework these items?\n\nHeres a really annoying one in higher elo games: Will the 3 camps into lvl 3 gank top/bottom lane be changed? Due to this, the laner (usually the top laner as they are lvl 2 vs lvl 3 jgler and have the lowest chance of outplaying it in any way) have to just sit back, lose exp and probably lane. The jgler stays on that side of the map until scuttle spawns. This just makes the game unplayable for a bit for that certain lane. Will this be changed?\n\nLast, but definitely not least, is there any, any, ANY chance that we can remove autofill in higher elos? It feels like an autoloss when the Kled 1 trick on your team is assigned Jg. No one enjoys it, and would actually rather have longer queues than have autofill games. This is a sentiment shared among streamers aswell. I know this may not be in your area; so I kept this for last.\n\nIMPORTANT EDIT: Just some evidence as of patch 10.3, date 2/9/2020, sourced from u.gg popular statistics website with cross reference to champion.gg, the top 5  Top lane champions are all ranged champions that deal magic damage (though emphasis on ranged). Evidence: https://gyazo.com/54f8aa475ebe00e5d5daacd1859122db &amp; https://u.gg/lol/tier-list?role=top .

Bro please, the top tier mid laners have been Qiyana, Talon, Fizz, Kassadin, Katarina, Akali (before this patch),... This is especially true in the high MMR where you play where the meta matters.\n\nTop lane players hate mages because they counter their champions and hold them back in the mid and late game, which is understandable. But please be objective and notice how mages have been pushed out of the mid lane in the past seasons.\n\nAlso, I don't mind Zonyahs being removed from the game entirely if that means mages will start with 30 base armour like assassins do instead of 19-21 that most of them have now.","replies":[{"poster":"CensoredMercy","date":"2020-02-07T22:28:33.741+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":2,"body":"I meant AD Assassins.

I am not saying purge the mages, I am saying that itemization is a problem when you compare the classes. Also, your zhonyas idea I find agreeable with of course the numbers being due to change.\n\nWhat about supporting your argument with acrual stats instead of the good old \"I'm higher on rank so I'm right\" one? I'm speaking from actual stats and not my own opinion, because opinions r usually affected by bias.\n\nSo first of all, pro play is very different from soloQ duo to having 5 people on comms together that also trained together for a long times. Hence, assassins r generally worse there because carries r well protected. Exceptions being Akali (before this patch), Leblanc and Qiyana because they have so many tools to still assassinate the carry unlike champions like Talon and Fizz who thrive on the randomness of soloQ plays.\n\nMages belong to the mid lane along side assassins. When on every single website there is only 1 certain mage with 6 or 7 assassins in the S tier, then I don't where u get that \"mager r strong and it's a common knowledge\" from.\n\nThe only mage that is statistically S tier is Cassiopeia since the conqueror rework. Maybe a keystone that gives that match adaptive force working on DPS mages was a mistake?\n\nAll other mages \"have the potential\" and that's it. If u r good with Syndra, who many people complain about her being broken as hell, u can carry games. But Syndra has a 47% win rate in Diamond+ while having 48% global win rate. That means she doesn't win that much and gets even worse the higher rank u go.\n\nSo now, how do u want to \"fix\" the mages items? If that means to nerf them, the entire class may reach the point where it's unplayable and will require buffing each mage individually. I actually believe the only stupid AP item is seekers/zonyahs and it could be reworked to work like Hexdraiker/Maw and that's it. At least it's worth trying at some point in a preseason to see how this change will affect the game.\n\nThe problem with ranged top is not because of op items or anything like that. It's because the easiest and most effortless lane win is playing range vs immobile melee. It's not even mages only r being played top. ADCs like Vayne, Lucian and Tristana as well.\n\nA good thing they did before is reducing the base AD of ranges champions so that auto attacks r not oppressive like they did with Neeko and that reduced her presence in top greatly. Otherwise u can't prevent people from throwing anything ranged (Soraka best top 2020 BTW) in the top lane to beat melee champions.","replies":[{"poster":"CensoredMercy","date":"2020-02-08T09:14:37.908+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am confused where you are finding this.

Jungle should always be able to punish lanes for being to aggressive or playing without vision, though in the current state of the game it’s hard to even outplay many of the ganks, especially when in a early 2v1 the jungler has a level over you and when the Elise dives you on repeat due to the fact you picked before her and picked a relatively easy champion to dive. On top of this, there is little stopping the enemy jungled in SoloQ from just sticking to your lane for half the game.

Think about his playrate. Swain itself is not a really popular champ, so that winrate combined with his nearly \"non-existant\" residual player base in mid, its because there are some stubborn otps like me who refuses to play him as a support.\nTry to check in first place how is the real perfomance of that champ with non otps, you will see in general terms that champ (in my opinion) will probably fall because he really needs too much practice to have an average perfomance in game.\n\nBut... why it happens?  \nWhy is Swain being played as a support instead of mid (his dessigned rol btw)?\nWhy most of his otps dont want him to be played as a support?\nAnd even more important... Why that support swain is so toxic for the botlane?\n\nok, let me explain you all the reasons:\n------------------------------------------\n#*1) WHY SWAIN HAS SO MUCH PROBLEMS AS A SOLOLANER AND WHY HIS MAIN PLAYERS ARE COMPLAINING ALL TIME?*\n\nThis is probably the easiest question to answer....\nThe reason is simple, as a sololaner, he has too much weakness that enemies can explode agasint you, and thoose weakness are not enough compensated by win conditions.\n\nAs a midlaner, he has not enough waveclear, he depends too much of hitting his [E], his skills are not enough rewarded if we consider how hard to hit can they be, and he has soome CD-DMG issues (like... too much CD for a really low burst dmg, or too weak dps dmg to justify  his expensive mana costs).\n\nNow i will explain every problem by worst to better...:\n\n* [E] Dependance: This is by far the worst problem of swain as a sololaner... And that's because hitting this skillshot doesnt depends from your aim at all but the fact of your enemy can dodge or not skillshots.\nAnd this is a really bad problem, because nowadays if you dont hit your E you lost about 50% of your dmg because you cant propperly use your combos...\n\nThat fact makes swain really abusive on lower elos (where people doesnt even try to dodge skillshots), or as a support (where its really easy to land your [E]), but it makes him really hard and non-satisfactory enough to play when you face high mobility champs or players who can dodge skills by sidestep)\n\nIf you want to listen my opinion about this... in game you feel sometimes like the old aurelion sol against evey champ who could CC him or pass his interior circle by mobility skills.\nAnd to be honest, sometimes it feels really unfair...\n.\n\n* Low Waveclear: I could understand it if you would tell me your itention was to balance him as a toplaner too.. but one thing is to say \"we dont want swain to make everry champ under turret for 15 mins\" and another different thing is to say \"we are fine considering he's the 2nd worst midlaner in cs\".\nAnd this is a big problem, because if his low waveclear would be compensated by powerspikes or great winconditions all would be fine.... but as you're going to see in next points thats not the case.\n.\n* High and non justified CD (overall):\n\n-On [Q]: 4scs is too much considering the insufficent dmg agasint minions, and specially the fact that bolts doesnt pierce champs (if that would be the case it would be logical, but since Swain is not the kind of champ who can easyly rush CDR, i think this is a really high cd for his main dmg source).\n\n-On [W]: Same as his Q... his last skill to be maxed... and it cant even waveclear.... but hey... he has 22 - 16 scs CD.... I mean, considering how usefull is for fights, i can understand the CD, but i cant stand the 50% dmg reduction agasint minions... :/\n\n-On [E]: I could understand 11 - 9 scs if that skillshot would pass tru units... or if the projectile would be easier to land (by more speed)... but no bro, it cant be that the only thing he needs to use all his combo has 9 CD scs when he is not even the main factor to land his E.\n.\n\n* Extremely easy to counter:\nSince he has 0 mobility, and he hasnt got a good win conditions by powerspikes, he is too much easy to be countered as a sololaner...\n\n-Healing: If you read the stats, you will agree about to be considered as a \"Self-Healer battle mage\" his healing stats are a joke... ( he has about 8k healing by average, and that's in my opinion just unjustifiable).\n\nI mean... you said you werent agree when some essential part of a champion's kit can be countered by everyone with nearly 0 effort... so... why the extremely low swain's self healings are same nerfed by the extremely common grievous hounds while another similar champions like vladimir or sylas can get about double healing?\nAnd i mean specially about his [R1 - Demonic Ascension], that can be nearly nullyfied by a single summoner spell or a single 800g item...\n--------------------------------\n\n#*2) WHY IS SWAIN BEING PLAYED MAINLY AS A SUPPORT INSTEAD OF A MID/TOPLANER AS HE WAS DESIGNED?\n\nThe reason is simple... as a support, he is far way more easier to play, because you wont have a great focus on you, you will find really easy to land your spells and stack your passive, and the reason you will be harrasing the enemy botlane will be really hard to counter (basically because as a support, its like an hybrid between thresh and zyra.... without most of their dissadvantages).\n\nYes, probably you wont have so much impact as you could get playing mid or top, but in exchange you get more stable on lane, and you can harrash your enemies without giving them many chances to react....\n\nIN OTHER WORDS.... If there is a lot of people playing him as a support, it could be because is really unsatisfactory to play this champ in mid or top in comparisson to supp (where you just need to ban morgana, brand or vayne to be impossible to be countered).\n\n-------------------\n#*3) WHY HIS OTPS DONT WANT SWAIN TO BE A SUPPORT?*\nSimple, because the role is not even  similar.\n\nIts supposed, Swain was designed to be \"The great noxian general\", a battlemage who can become a final boss if you're good enough and carry your team if you really deserve to win (or at least be able to try it)\nAs a sololaner, you really feel that sensation by fighting, becoming stronger, beinf proactive... etc.\n\nHowever, as a support, you looks like the secondary actor, who is there to help his team and being a good boy.\nSomeone who doesnt want to be a lider but someone who wants to make the rest play confortable....\n\nAnd the fact, is that his \"support\" face doesnt really fits with his spirit, to be honest.\nMost of his main players love his \"badasss\" style and his \"anti-heroic\" way to win games just by your own strengts, while most of players who have started playing him as a support its because they dont really find another way to enjoy his champ (because of all thoose weakness i've told you before).\n\nIn addition, i remember that you said you wouldnt force a reworked champ playerbase to be played in a different role, and lets be honest, refusing to even study the problem you're forcing too much swain players to play in a role who doesnt reprensent their champ....\n\n------------------------------------\n#*4) WHY IS SWAIN SO TOXIC FOR THE BOTLANE?*\nI dont really know if you played agasint many swains  in bot, but if you do... you will find its extremely frustrating for his enemies...\n\nIm not talking in this point of his winrate or perfomance, im just talking about how unfair feels to face swain as a support... \nBecause in that role, all his counterplay dissapears (what is even worse than having too much ways to be countered in my opinion).\n\nBasically you will find him like a \"thresh\" who doesnt needs to  aim or calculate his \"grab\" because his skillshot pass tru units or a zyra who is far way harder to kill, because lets be honest, even considering his ridiculously low self healing capacity, he's not easy to oneshot, because of his build.\n\nSo... basically if they ban morgana, vayne or brand, you better ask your jungler to live in bot from lvl 2 because if thats not the case your botlane will be probably lost.\n\n(in addition btw, remember that he can easily get souls in bot, so he wont even get mana problems or hp problems because of his passive)\n\n--------------------\n------------\n--------\n#*SUMMARY OF THIS PART*\n-----------\n---------\n----------\nMost of his otps and playerbase wants him to be back as a sololaner, but nowadays he has too much weakness agasint too much situations, what makes his gameplay experience really unsatisfactory.\n\nBy the other side, as a support, he hasnt got much counterplay, resulting in a way more toxic game style and a role who doesnt really fits with the champ.\n\nHis midlane winrate its due to the fact most of his players from mid are otps (same as it happens with zylean in mid and support for example), so that winrate its not a really fiable stat considering how low is his play rate in midlane (that should be his main role, because he was designed as a midlaner and not as a support)","replies":[{"poster":"GFREEMEN","date":"2020-02-08T21:40:45.487+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I 100% agree with this.
