While we still have no plans for a formal midseason patch (big disruptive changes that reshape the way you play League), we'll have a higher than usual amount of changes like the recent Urgot work so these patches will be heftier than what you've seen in the first half of 2019. \r\n\r\n**Systems Changes**\r\n\r\n * **Early Jungle Lane Dependence** - This one is here because we think we can target a common jungler pain point without a big amount of change. Philosophically we like for junglers to participate in the wider game and have to take risks to succeed, but we also want to solve a frustration point that early fights are too important and junglers feel overly reliant on laner rotations to succeed. We’re testing changes around scuttle mechanics and possibly other tactics to see if we can create a less pressured level 2 fight-or-lose situation. \r\n * **Inspiration overuse as secondary** - Inspiration is stifling a lot of other cool secondary rune tree options by bringing too much value. We are exploring both nerfs there and also buffs to the other tree minor runes to make them have more splash appeal.\r\n * **Hunter’s Potion** - This item is a tempting option that currently is a trap because it’s weak and additionally doesn’t really add a lot of interest beyond a ton of sustain. We’re experimenting with some small reworks to make this usable and fun but if we can’t find any compelling spaces we’ll remove this item altogether. \r\n * **Aftershock** - Pretty simple goals here to reduce the power of this rune on champs not building tanky while keeping it good on tanks and bruisers. \r\n\r\n**Champion Changes**\r\n\r\n * **Blitzcrank** - We'll be shipping the quality of life improvements that you saw on PBE recently: making Blitz's passive shield more consistent, removing the randomness from R's passive, and giving Blitz a bit more payoff for auto attacking \r\n * **Tahm Kench** - The goal here is to make TK less of an action stopper in very high elo and pro while also making him a playable support pick for the average player. Our current direction makes TK slow when devouring an ally (like when he devours an enemy) to pull a bit of power out of coordinated saves. To compensate we’re buffing his Q slow and making devour -> spit minions cost less so that he can use it more\r\n * **Zac** - We’re currently testing a mostly reverted version of the Ult with a few improvements to help it have more clear gameplay and understandable impact. \r\n * **Aatrox** - He still has been too hard to counter at high level and pro play which really hurts his playability for normal players. Our current changes make his ult revive only activate if he gets a takedown while his ult is active to remove his reliable ability to deny his own death. To compensate we’re buffing his baseline stats and exploring some other spicy additions.\r\n\r\nAs usual, these are all work in progress so we may change or even not ship some of these ideas if they don’t come together well. Thanks for playing with us and I’m looking forward to your feedback and ideas. \r\n\r\nScruffy\r\n\r\nhttps://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/9.2.1/img/champion/Sion.png","replies":[{"poster":"Dannar Hetoshi","date":"2019-04-12T19:13:54.813+0000","up_votes":41,"down_votes":1,"body":"TL-DR BELOW.\n\nTahm Kench's Q slow and W cost on minions are both in good spots.  Putting more power into those will do nothing for his support WR and give him more power in the top lane.\n\nKeep nerfing W targeting coordinated play (there was a proposed change that W would auto-spit allies if Tahm takes unshielded damage, and that is a much better change in my opinion than the self-slow)\n\nIf you want to fix his support win rate, you need to revert E nerfs, and HP nerf (now that Targons has been nerfed to Oblivion).\n\nTahm is a warden like Braum, Taric, Galio (all played bot lane).\n\nHowever all of those champions have something that Tahm does not:\n\nDamage Reduction or Resistance amplifications, or both.\n\nTaric: Bastion \nBraum: Stand Behind Me, Unbreakable\nGalio: Shield of Durand\n\nOf these three, only Braum has the same base HP as Tahm Kench, and Braum's passive synergizes much better with ADCs than Tahm's passive.  We won't even get into the fact that both Braum and Galio have a Dash built in their abilities (not counting ultimates).\n\nI'm not saying Tahm should get Resistances on his E, or damage Reduction like Braum.  Don't get me wrong.\n\nI like that Tahm is literally an HP tank rather than an armor stat like Taric/Braum/Galio.  But a lot of HP Nerfs in runes, items and combined with nerfs to his E have had zero effect on him in pro play, but are major Nerfs to his solo q play.\n\nTL-DR: \nBuff E.  Nerf W (targeting coordinated play, as above).  Tahm is an HP tank, yet has LESS HP than every other warden, and doesn't gain bonus resistances through abilities.  Give him his HP sustain back through his E.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jeddy017","date":"2019-04-12T17:08:07.928+0000","up_votes":45,"down_votes":5,"body":">Zac - We’re currently testing a mostly reverted version of the Ult with a few improvements to help it have more clear gameplay and understandable impact.\n\n{{sticker:sg-kiko}}  nice.","replies":[{"poster":"ShadyGecko","date":"2019-04-12T18:59:31.144+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":3,"body":"Will Zac E nerfs to warning/knockup time be reverted as well?","replies":[]},{"poster":"DONT REVERT ZAC ","date":"2019-04-12T20:43:55.630+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":13,"body":"And what exactly is \"nice\"?","replies":[{"poster":"Jeddy017","date":"2019-04-13T00:10:26.377+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"Simple, I prefer his old ult rather than the new one.

If the ult isn't good enough, don't revert it to something worse instead (there is usually a reason stuff gets reworked). Either keep it or make it better instead of just reverting it. It feels kinda lazy or populistic but maybe im wrong here? The same happened with for example rengar and le blanc.

When I always think of aatrox I always think of his revive both before and after the rework and thought it was great that aspect was maintained. \n\nI do think some things need to be changed around, unfortunately I don't have any ideas.\n\nI did however like one addition that was on the pbe at one time where his Q's basically had no cooldown during his ultimate, which I think a lot of people would like as it would make Aatrox feel like the more old unstoppable one pre rework. \n\nYou guys did a great job with the Urgot revamp to balance him around a lot better and give him a unique identity.

I DON'T EVEN REMEMBER USING THIS USELESS SPELL IN TEAMFIGHTS.\n-You could do some nice things with Zac's old version of his ultimate, like flash behind an enemy and knock him into your team, but there was only one problem - YOU WERE JUMPING LIKE AND IDIOT FOR 4 SECONDS, UNABLE TO DO ANYTHING DURING THAT TIME, EXCEPT SPAMMING \"W\" BRAINLESSLY.\nOn top of that you can do the same thing with Zac's new version of his ultimate, but now you are able to do more than just pressing after casting ult \"W\".\n\nThe current version of Zac is better than the old one.

Junglers aren't just lane dependent early due to scuttlers, they also tend to scale pretty badly and have no real late game rune alternative. They're forced to gank a ton because they can't carry themselves. \n\nOf course there are exceptions like Kindred, Eve, Yi, Kha but as a playstyle, I don't really have good late game options as jg like we used to in S8 with DH. The old rune had a totally different identity than it does now and it doesn't seem OK for me to have a rework of a rune with the same name and have it serve completely different users. I loved the soul pickup for allies (actually a good anti-tilt mechanism), camps and enemies. It actually affected the way I played fights, had true late game potential and was much more interesting than what it is now. \n\nBTW: Do you guys read the PBE feedback section much?

Philosophically we like for junglers to participate in the wider game and have to take risks to succeed, but we also want to solve a frustration point that early fights are too important and junglers feel overly reliant on laner rotations to succeed. We’re testing changes around scuttle mechanics and possibly other tactics to see if we can create a less pressured level 2 fight-or-lose situation.\"\n\nThe reason it's fight or lose at that scuttle is because of the xp nerf!

His ult is the real problem he just doesn't provide the kind of damage or CC to make his ult useful most of the time unless he has coordination with someone else. While it IS a unique and iconic ult, if you want to push him more towards being a support then you need to change his ult to something that can be used bot lane, preferably in combat. Just nerfing his W will make him a worse and worse support because no one is ever going to take Tahm bot for his crappy single target slow. He needs more utility.","replies":[]}]}
