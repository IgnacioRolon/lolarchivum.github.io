The work or goals could change depending on what we discover, and projects mentioned may get delayed or even stopped. That said, I believe it’s important to share as much as we can even if plans may change.\r\n\r\n**Matchmaking and Ranked future**\r\nWe’ve been collecting feedback and ramping up on many big and small problems that we’d like to solve around matchmaking and ranked throughout the year. After taking it all in, we’ve created a pretty exciting roadmap for the future changes we’d like to make to ranked and matchmaking over the next year. Expect a dev blog very soon with our plans for the future.\r\n\r\nOne update I do have for now is that we’re currently working on adding **autofill parity** to matchmaking - this means we can balance both teams to have a similar number of autofilled players on each team. Our results so far are very promising and we think we can ship this feature pretty quickly and see significant improvement. \r\n\r\n**Top Lane Impact**\r\nWith our long term goal of giving top laners higher game impact (ability to carry a game) in high elo, we’re exploring a few different strategies:\r\n\r\n* Carrying through items - We have a few potential changes to core top lane items like Black Cleaver, Sunfire, and the Hydra items to give fighters and tanks some more carry power later. \r\n* Early strategic impact - The dragon creates a highly valued objective that all positions other than top have a strong ability to contest. We’re hoping to get top more integrated into the early objective game through a more powerful teleport summoner or making Rift Herald more comparable in value to dragon.\r\n* Turning leads into victories - Finding some ways to slightly amp up the payout in the early game for winning top lane can make it more comparable to the other positions. We’re exploring things like increasing melee damage to plates.\r\n\r\n**Jungle Satisfaction and Personal Power**\r\nWith our long term goal of increasing Jungle satisfaction while not pushing their control over the early game too high, we’re testing a few things for upcoming patches:\r\n\r\n* Reduced Gank Power - in particular lowering the value of a gank (which is currently very high). This might sound counterintuitive for making jungle feel more satisfying, but the goal is to allow junglers to hold a bit more of the power themselves instead of donating it to their laners through ganks.\r\n * Introducing a new early game homeguards when you respawn after a death \r\n * Slight reduction in shared XP for kills by multiple champions\r\n * Slight increase in XP for solo kills (which is a small buff for invade junglers, too)\r\n* Increased farm XP \r\n * With the reduced gank power we can give junglers more XP through farming the jungle\r\n\r\n**How snowbally is the game today?**\r\nShort answer - it’s in a good state. \r\n\r\nLong answer - one of the key game statistics that we monitor and balance systems around is the amount of snowball in the game. Over time we’ve found that there is a sweet spot where we get the core benefits from snowball that we’re looking for:\r\n\r\n* There is enough snowball that early game leads matter (if the game had no snowball, you could sit in fountain for the first 15 minutes and still win)\r\n* There is not too much snowball so that early game decides the game entirely\r\n\r\nSome interesting data to show - This is one of our metrics that tracks how decided (snowballed) a game is at 15 minutes. The three lines shown are\r\n\r\n* Red - Large Lead - One team has a 90%+ chance of winning the game\r\n* Green - Medium Lead - One team has a 75%+ chance of winning \r\n* Blue - Even Game - No team has a 75%+ chance of winning\r\n\r\nWe’ve found that this “sweet spot” for snowball in LoL is when at 15 minutes, roughly 25% of games have large lead, 35% of games have medium lead, and 40% of games are close to even. Currently we’re seeing a pretty good state of snowball.\r\n\r\nhttps://imgur.com/a/6n25UHy\r\n\r\nYou can see that in the last few seasons there have been spikes and dips in snowball, and through systems changes we’ve been able to re-stabilize that game state. \r\n\r\nHere are some factors that we commonly rely on when we want to change overall snowball a lot:\r\n\r\n* Kill gold/rewards\r\n* Early objective rewards (towers, dragon, etc)\r\n* Shutdown gold\r\n* Death timers\r\n\r\nThanks again for playing and engaging with us about the game. See you next time!\r\n\r\nScruffy\r\nhttps://twitter.com/MarkYetter\r\nhttps://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/9.24.2/img/champion/Sion.png","replies":[{"poster":"Palaven","date":"2020-02-21T17:54:17.619+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":0,"body":"My concern about the top lane approach is that there are two thought processes which are IN CONFLICT with each other.\n1) Allowing top laners to roam and get involved (e.g., teleport)\n2) Rewarding a top laner more for winning his lane\n\nThe problem with plates being easier to take, or giving more gold, is that it assumes the absent top laner was \"forced\" out of lane instead of roaming.  The more value plates have and the easier they are to take, the more punishing it is to roam.\n\nMy biggest issue with top lane impact is when the other four players on both sides play a fiesta on the bot side of the map.  So much gold is thrown back and forth that both top laners are relatively much weaker in comparison.\n\nMy personal preference is to give top laners more agency in moving around the map.  But if plates are easier to take or worth more gold, then roaming has a higher cost and you are forced to just sit in lane to deny gold while you pray your team wins the 4v4.\n\nAnother concept is to lower the gold and exp from kills FOR EVERYONE.  Often in the top lane, both players recognize who is stronger and play properly.  You don't have many kills traded.  If kills were worth less, a fiesta bot side wouldn't put both top laners so far behind relative to the other players in the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shaian","date":"2020-02-21T19:22:24.846+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":4,"body":"There are alot of Zyra plant interactions that just feel super bad to play. Some of them are intended apparently and some are not\n\n- A single Ahri W-fire instantly kills any plant. So if you cast 3 plants on top of Ahri she just needs to press W and all plants instantly die.\n- Annie Q on plants for free\n- Cassio can use E on plants with the &lt;1 sec cd on it, killing the plant onehit and getting the mana back\n- Corki E does both tick very rapid and does 2x of its intended damage (since its split magic and physical, this did not get fixed unlike the Corki autos)\n- Gangplank's R does like 4x its inteded damage. It's coded as AoE-ability over Multihit. A single Wave out of the many he has instantly kills an ulted plant\n- Graves oneshots plants with autoattacks\n- Heimers turrets deal 8x their inteded damage. A single turretshot instantly kills a Zyraplant\n- Irelia can Q plants and oneshot them to heal up, stack passive and it resets her Q as well so Zyra's own plants don't zone her, but give her engage opportunities and the plant can't attack her back\n- Same with Qiyana and Yasuo E, Fiora Q\n- Karthus can oneshot plants with isolated Q's for free\n- When Kayle is exhaulted she oneshots plants if she focusses them. Also her E oneshots plants\n- Kayn killing plants with one Q (AoE instead of Multihit)\n- Nautilus E kills all plants around him\n- Rammus W halflifes plants per auto\n- Ryze E onehits plants and spreads the flux. Like its not even an investment to throw it on a plant in lane, because it doesn't restrict his waveclear\n- Skarner's second Q oneshots Zyraplants\n- Every single Taliyah rock from Q can onehit a plant\n- Urgot passive onehits a plant, his W with its tickrate literally as well (needs 2 \"autos\")\n- Viktor Q to gain a shield, kill the plant and run fast into your face to trade back or enhance him to get in range of you to chase you down\n- Yasuo tornado oneshots plants\n- damage of DoT's depend on tickrate so Singed does 2x dmg than full AP Morg W, which sucks\n- if DoT abilities are Liandries enhanced (which is not unlikely midgame) the plants die even faster\n- If they have Ludens on top half of the plant HP is gone anyway aka abilities kill them instantly\n- Melee Champs can kill plants in EWRQW combo before they are buffed by R or even attack (if you have aa's without command enabled they kill them without input)\n- Champs like Rengar can get combod with EWWR but AA -> Tiamat -> W and kill all ulted plants around. Tiamat in general feels super unfair to play against\n- Doing this to kill plants is not an investment, Its always worth doing that because plants are where Zyra's damage lies. If you use one ability to deny her damage you still have enough for Zyra herself. She can't do anything afterwards. Thats why 7.24 which meant to buff her midlane made her actually worse in that role. They are so many tools which deny her as a champ and main carry of her team.\n\n- Putting points in W after level 13 is so pointless. 2 seconds less CD on W means nothing since you get a seedreset instantly per takedown in a teamfight. And you got a passive as well. It could be used to make these interactions not completely unfair later in the game. No scaling after level 13 except plantdamage per level and ult is awkward.\n\n- These things are super tragic especially in Master+ games, because even if they don't know it pregame they figure stuff out and abuse it straight up for the rest of the game. Instead of feeling zoned they charge in instead to kill the plants. Especially melee tanks or carries with alot of attackspeed.\n\nEdit: Immolate is now a thing as well so tanks don't even need to autoattackoneshot plants anymore. They do half of their hp just by immolate, half any aoe ability they do. And even if they dont do any AoE, plants still get hit by the normal sunfire damage.\n\nIts been more than 2 years like that and only MF + Corki autos got fixed yet.","replies":[{"poster":"Dreamhare","date":"2020-02-21T20:18:11.105+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":2,"body":"I hope someone from Riot sees and actually reads this","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kezarah","date":"2020-02-21T20:44:45.063+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yes to all of this, Riot please just fixing these things alone would make Zyra feel so much better to play. She isn't really weak right now, but not really that strong either and I think these changes wouldn't push her over the edge and then  it wouldn't feel like picking her into certain champs is troling. A good chunk of her dps is in her plants, and against diamond or higher tier players that know they can one shot them with certain things in their kit that IMO shouldn't, it makes her feel pretty useless in matchups that would otherwise be more even and gives them a free 3g when you try to use your plants.

Why are Riot pushing for champions to play similarly? The bloated systems I talked about prior have inflated damage, sustain (hp/mana), and cool-down accessibility which in turn has gutted unique identities of champions in favour pushing them to just be viable in this team-deathmatch meta. \n\nFor example: Sub-classes such as control mages have vanished and replaced by Riot's favorite, the burst mage. Please stop deviating from the design pillars that got the game to where it is today. I would link Morello's design philosophy article from 2014 that suited what LoL is; a hardcore competative mulitplayer game but your new shiny website has destroyed all archives of such /dev blogs AND patch-notes from previous seasons -_-","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheeTrueKeklel","date":"2020-02-21T18:46:52.672+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":4,"body":"D2 toplaner here. Buffing teleport would do the opposite, nerfing toplane.\n\n**Why is teleport a problem rather than a solution?**\n**1. **Teleport is currently a summoner utilized to nullify the negative consequences of your performance early game in the laning phase makes the early stages for toplane less important. Incentivizing flocking to other areas of the map instead of impacting top side of the map makes top side less important. Give reason for your teammates to play around the topside of the map to give the lane more impact. \n**2.** Teleport needs a nerf where it can't be utilized immediately after death via abusing early game death timers**(which were lowered)**. It's extremely exploitative and can make early lane consequences completely irrelevant. **Ex. **You get first blooded but immediately tp back while the enemy laner is likely at some sort of deficit like health. This leads to:\n\n**Ex A1.** If the wave is in your favor and the enemy laner is too unhealthy to walk up, you can establish a freeze and close the gap between his first blood with an XP advantage(While he loses minion gold)\n\n**Ex A2.** Even if the wave isn't in your favor you instantaneously re-establish lane priority\nThese potential consequences is why matching TP is essentially required for Toplane currently. The lowered death respawn timers has indirectly buffed teleport.\n\n\n**Rift Herald**\n**1. **Rift Herald is pretty effective, a good change to it would be to nerf it's HP so it's faster/less risky to acquire. Make having priority early game in toplane important. However something like a melee damage multiplier against it/ranged resistance would be ideal if you wouldn't want a sudden swap of bot lane duo's going top lane to take the more important objective.\n\n> Carrying through items - We have a few potential changes to core top lane items like Black Cleaver, Sunfire, and the Hydra items to give fighters and tanks some more carry power later.\n\nBruisers: Itemization too expensive or understat relative to the items of other classes. Overdue for an item update.\n\nTanks: Lacks MR itemization and appealing hybrid resistance items**(Armor itemization is not weak)**\n\nBoth classes need not only a buff to existing items but an item update, possibly more items with a rework to some.

They **biggest issue BY MILES** for toplaners later on is that they tend to excel in extendet combat patterns, but they rarly can spend more than 2 sec in a teamfights without beeing CCed till they are dead or atleast need to retreat. we need either lower CC uptime in generall or better anti-(chain)CC options for teamfights, and we need more tankiness especially in teamifghts, or less anti tqank mechanics.\nI think the best was to accomplish that without makeing toplaners to dominant in skirmishes is by giveing more items defensive effects that scale with the number of nearby opponents. Sterak's for example could have the delay of it's shield-decay changed to 1 sec per nearby opponent, so you're near guranteed to get full value in a teamfight while basically staying the same 1v1.\nBuffing BotrKs %hp damage is really not what we need, we need more tankiness, not more tools to combat tankiness.\n\n\n**Early strategic impact**:\n\nObjectives:\nI can see only two ways to make this work: Either give Heralds some kind of permanent reward, or chage/remove dragon soul.\nThe big thing with dragonsoul is, once you havve it you have a permanent advantage that stays no matter what. Even if everyone is lvl 18 with fullbuilt and both teams only have their nexus standing, dragonsoul will still give an advantage that your opponent can never equalize, you will always be a little bit ahead.\nSo either Herald can offer something similar, or dragonsoul gets removed or turned into a temporary boost, else dragons will always be more vlauable than herald(unless it's so overtuned that it creates an insane early snowball that ends the game befor dragonsoul ever gets relevant)\n\nTP:\nFor soloQ, the most important change would be to allow cancleing once again. In a non coordinated enviroment, TP plays are a coinflip between a heroic play and pure suicide atm. It happens quite often that you TP, and your team just disengage with you ending up 1vX and basically beeing removed from the game cause you die AND invest TP with no returns at all, setting you massively behind.\n\n**Turning leads into victories:**\n\nIt's quite simple: **BRING BACK VISION!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!**\nGive us green wards, or atleast buff the vision totem and return warding items for junglers.\nAs toplaner, if you want to push an advantage you need to play agressive, which leaves you open for ganks, so the only way to get agressive without feeding is haveing solid vision. \nHaveing solid vision however, is nigh impossible on your own and even with the help of your jungler it's barly doable. You need till lvl 13 to get a 100% uptime on a single ward, and a single ward is BY FAR not enough. And then there are sweepers and umbrale glaive aswell...\nAt lvl 6, you'll spend nearly 50% of the time without ward even if you use your trinket exactly on CD. If your jungler doesn't track the opponents jungler and communicate, you basically have no way to go agressive unless your already fed enough to win 1v2.\nIt also makes it hard to roam to other lanes, cause you always have to jurny into the dark when you go for a rotation, since all of your teams wards are usually around your 4man(which usually should be setup around an objective), and the path from the offlane to your team remains dark.\n\nAlso, if items and strategic impact are adressed properly, getting an early lead top will automatically translate more easily into a victory, so i wouldn't go for raw snowball increases like more plate damage untill we see the imapct of other changes.\n\n---------------------------------\n\n**Jungle Satisfaction and Personal Power**:\n\n**Reduced Gank Power:**\n\nAs a laner, the two biggest issues i have with jungle ganks are vision and their first clear. \nThe firstclear gives to much xp to quickly, paired with double buff and on meta junglers not even HP loss. It's just disgusting wehn the jungler can walk at full HP with double buff and a lvl lead or atelast even level into your lane and 1v1 you without any help of his laner. Just lower the first lcear xp so you need one more camp for lvl 3, or maybe even so you need 2 camps for lvl 2(with lower damage on early camps so clears don't become to harsh) to lower the impact on those very early ganks.\nAlso, as mentioned for toplane already, **GIVE US OUR GOD DAMN WARDS BACK!!!!!!!!!!**. The main issue with ganking is that you can't counter it through vision at all(unless your support). The state of vision is just pathetic and we're living in the dark ages of runeterra...\nIf i head a decent chance on spotting the jungler when he comes for a gank, i could react, but atm i have to play totally save unless my jungler is nearby AND i'm 100% sure he reacts AND we win the 2v2.\n\nI like the early homeguard idea though, might also make room for TP buffs, cause TP's advantage in getting back to lane early wouldn't be as sigificant any more. Atm, i take TP less for global plays(way to suicidal in soloQ) and mostly for lane cause a free shopping trip every few min is a massive advantage on the sidelane.\n\n**Jungle Satisfaction:**\n\nIncreaseing xp(and maybe gold) for farming certainly will help.\nHowever, i feel like jungle items really need to be looked at aswell. They mostly feel like a crutch your forced to use and come to lategame, it feels bad to have either an inferior item, or no combat summoner.\nImo The jungle item could work like old Eleisa's Miracle: Make it a 1k gold sink to limit early combat power of junglers like it's now, but instead of upgradeing it into full items, it has a quest(defeat X big monsters) that repays atleast a part of that gold **and turns it from an iteam into a permanent buff** so you get that inventary slot but still keep better jungleing and an upgraded smite(which might need some small nerfs with the lower opportunity cost)\nThis would oppen up alot more flexibillity for built paths and more lategame statisfaction on junglers, and some items concepts like cinderhulk's %hp bonus or the %hp on hit from bloodrazor could be used for new items that are accesible for laners aswell.\nAt the very least, change warriors into something less boring.\n\n-----------------------\n---------------------\n\n**How snowbally is the game today?**\n\nI feel like you guys have a very different metric on that than i do.\nI would never call a 74% winrate at 15min a 'close' or 'even' game. 60% winrate max for close/even games, and even that is quite generous.\n75% winrate is only a medium lead? Yea, we really have a different opinion on that.\n75% winrate for me means the game is basically decided by that point, but there is that 25% chance that the winning team throwsbefor it can finish, but the loosing team basically has no agency other than staying alarmed to actually punish a throw of their opponents.\n\nFor me, the metrics would be:\nClose/Even = &lt;60% winrate @15\nMedium lead = &lt;80% winrate @15\nLarge lead = 80%+ winrate @15\n\nWith my metrics, we'd have over 50% largeleads and only about 20-30% close/even games, and that ratio is unacceptable.\nIt's no wonder the game feels like a stomp-fest if over half of the games are basically decided at the 15min mark.\n\nI can atleast agree on the sweetspot, though i'd prefer ~40/40/20 over 40/35/25\nHowever, with less generous metrics in terms of close and medium lead, we are quite a far shot from those sweetspots...\nAgain, i can't understand how anyone can consider 60-75% win as an even game, it's just...not.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ThornyZyra","date":"2020-02-21T18:12:57.685+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is it possible to make Zyra viable in Jungle? @Riot Scruffy","replies":[]},{"poster":"DCYOUNG888","date":"2020-02-21T18:03:17.535+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Riot Scruffy, out of curiosity, for top lane how are the {{item:3074}} {{item:3748}} Hydra items and {{item:3071}} Black Cleaver get adjusted/buffed for the the fighters/tanks?

I'd say that titanic and ravenous only need 10% CDR to be impactful choices. It's a big reason why top laners lack impact and there are a few reasons for that:\n\n1) bruisers rely on the base damage of their abilities (and their effects) to deal dmg and stay alive since they have to go for defensive items so their dmg is heavily relying on abilities instead of pure damage items.\n2) All other classes (even some ADCs that need it, like Lucian) can easily get to 40% CDR while bruisers just stand still doing nothing but getting DPS-ed down by the enemy team.\n3) Most bruisers lately rely mostly on abilities and that's even more visible in newer champs who also have low AS ratio and AS/lvl. Older champs (like Jax, old Xin and such) didnt rely on CDR because their autos could be lethal on their own.\n4) not sure what else\n\nTL;DR: Bruisers need more CDR options and Titanic/Ravenous Hydra are some great items to start on with this plan.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MikuSan","date":"2020-02-21T17:52:43.664+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":15,"body":"If only riot listened to the playerbase about what the issues are instead of pulling information out of nowhere. \n\nif only.","replies":[{"poster":"Jng Account","date":"2020-02-21T17:59:20.955+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MikuSan,realm=EUW,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=AT1WbAOj,comment-id=0016,timestamp=2020-02-21T17:52:43.664+0000)\n>\n> If only riot listened to the playerbase about what the issues are instead of pulling information out of nowhere. \n> \n> if only.\n\nlol\n\nstatics &lt; players opinions\n\nNo thank you...","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Cizzurd","date":"2020-02-21T21:13:48.156+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd like to see another learning curve graph of champs, specifically Aphelios, did he turn out to be a high skill champ when mastered?

Currently Bruisers have really awful MR itemization and Tanks have situational at best MR itemization. Bruisers have to choose between {{item:3156}} {{item:3065}} and {{item:3091}}. In most cases Maw is simply worse than {{item:3053}} while {{item:3065}} and {{item:3091}} have limited uses and most bruisers can't itemize them effectively. Simply allowing Hexdrinker and Maw's passives to stack with Steraks would go along way with helping top lane impact because it's fairly common to get fed as a top laner, but be unable to use your lead to win teamfights due to getting CC locked and bursted by mages. Then once it gets to the ultra lategame, ADC's simply have so much damage while you have been itemizing tank items that you can't kill them through their lifesteal.\n\n.\n\n I understand that stacking MR isn't highly needed on most tanks due to mages incapability to kill tanks anyway due to reliance on cooldowns, and for the ones that do we have {{item:3194}}. However the other two \"general\" MR options of tanks are very situation. {{item:3065}} has wasted gold value on tanks without healing and {{item:3001}} has wasted gold value on tanks that don't have magic damage or don't use mana.
