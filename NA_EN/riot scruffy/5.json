The two different versions that we&#039;re working with right now are \r\n\r\n1. Vector cast W (similar to rumble ult)\r\n2. Current w cast paradigm without lockout (so as soon as you choose a direction, casting is unlocked)\r\n\r\nBoth are testing pretty well for us internally and are meeting our goals of increased usability for both W and W-&gt;E combo. No promises to make but we&#039;re targeting the 6.14 patch.\r\n\r\nSide note: with her current strength and the increased dps from the removal of the W lockout with these changes we will likely have to nerf her in other ways to keep her from going out of control. Possible spaces here are Q mana/early damage or W-&gt;E combo damage. \r\n\r\nThis is just a heads up to keep everyone informed but any and all feedback is welcome in this thread.","replies":[{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2016-06-24T18:54:43.163+0000","up_votes":24,"down_votes":10,"body":"Finally.

Changing her W to a vector cast does nothing to shift her power, it'll just make the ability easier for some people to use. You need to go with option 2. I know not being able to cast and proc her E after her W was intentionally designed, but her self silence is ridiculous. No other champion has a self imposing weakness like she does, and she already has other drawbacks (like her worked ground) that most champions don't. It's incredibly frustrating to use your W, and thus be silenced at that the complete whim of your enemies until it detonated. You can't zhonyas, flash, or even use a potion, and that's too long of a window where she's essentially useless, especially if you miss her W.

You already had a system in place for these types of spells that Rumble and Victor have been enjoying for years, so if the listed reasoning was \"because that kind of spell is weird and different, making it hard to learn\" then why would you introduce another new spell cast that replicates everything a vector cast did, but slower, clunkier, and far less precise? My only real guess is that you wanted the option to keep the spell as a standard Cho-gath knockup while allowing you to make it a directional knock if desired. The big problem with that is that nearly all the time you're going to be trying to add a direction so the entire spell just becomes a chore to use.\n\nIt only took me one game to get the pattern down in order to get the spell to go where I wanted, but until I untrained my vector tendencies, it was very unfun and practically ruined the champion for me from a design standpoint. At least you're actually considering and testing vector casting instead of stubbornly telling the players that the current cast paradigm is objectively superior and to just deal with it.\n\nI don't know why you think she'll have to be nerfed for this usability fix, though.

Her e+w combo will be easier to land and it already does a lot of damage. The combo is part of the mechanical aspect of league. As for competitive game having the difference between players who can land and players who cant, will show the person's investment in a champion. The e+w combo is not easy to pull off with a tough opponent and landing it against these players just gives you, as a player,  a compliment to how much you have practiced Taliyah.  As for the possibility of option 2, it can be a nice tuning for Taliyah. I do remember messing up my combo because of the direction I launch my enemy to. Being punish for this is very reasonable and its part of the learning process. \n\nAs my stand point, Taliyah is currently in a balance position. A nice tune on her damage might be enough to give her opponents a room for counter play. But we also need to consider that when she is in her worked ground, her dps sinks drastically. It is her weakness and people should punish it, but it does not mean it needs a nerf. Having to think about the spacing and all is part of her kit. And this is probably the most difficult part learning Taliyah. A player cannot just use Taliyah's Q blindly. This applies throughout the whole game, laning, team fights, and so on. Her weakness is clear and also reveals the balance in her kit. Not to mention her Ult is a utility based, its a very situational Ult but it is in very rare occasion in use during 1v1 or team fights. Also another drawback. Though preferably a tuning on e, maybe her early damage or even mana can also be considered when she is in the spotlight for a change/nerf. There are a lot possibilities that Taliyah can be change to balance her overall. However, I do believe her mechanical aspect should not change. Theres a room for counter play and most of all its challenging, fun, and rewarding as the way it is.

Furthermore, vector cast makes if far more difficult to cast W for a regular knock-up, for example if you're trying to combo the spell with an ally spell, but don't want to knock the enemy out of your ally's AoE.
