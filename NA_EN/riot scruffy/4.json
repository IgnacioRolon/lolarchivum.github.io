With the holidays, this will probably be the last post of 2019, so we hope you all get some rest and stay cozy someplace warm. See you all in January. \r\n\r\n**Patch 9.24b**\r\nThe end of year always presents some unique challenges with our patch schedule winding down and us wanting to get in as many tweaks as we can to tune preseason. Patch 9.24 is our last full patch of the year and just went live this week. We are planning to do a follow up “mini patch” next week with more champion and systems balance (but no major features or mechanics changes). \r\n\r\n**Dragon Souls and Elder**\r\nWe’ve had enough time and data to do analysis on the impacts of dragon soul and elder dragon buff as end game objective rewards. In general both dragon souls and elder buff are stronger than we think they should be, but some individual buffs are more than others. Our plans for 9.24b are: \r\n\r\n* Ocean Soul - big nerf\r\n* Infernal Soul - moderate nerf\r\n* Mountain Soul - moderate nerf\r\n* Elder buff - moderate nerf\r\n* Cloud Soul - no change\r\n\r\n**Lethality items follow up**\r\nOverall we’re seeing the updated Lethality items as a bit underpowered across the board. Our current approach is that we want to buff Serrated Dirk by 5 AD to make the build path a bit more powerful and create some more early threat. Additionally we also want to buff Edge of Night by that same 5 AD, so that buying it in the right games (mage / CC heavy) has a slightly higher payoff. Aside from that, the individual items are filling a unique set of contexts and roles well, so assassins now have a few more choices around how they want to focus their builds. \r\n\r\n**Support items follow up**\r\nThe core concept of only having to buy the support once, and then immediately transitioning into the main item system has landed really well we think. It’s leading to more flexible build options for supports that feel more tailored to the champ you're playing. Another positive effect we’re seeing is a few more viable champs to the support role that would rather not have spent a lot of gold on the old items. \r\n\r\nWe do however have two areas that we want to improve for 10.1. One is differentiating the stat lines more between the aggressive and defensive options. Relic Shield and Steel Shoulderguard will have some of their offensive stats pushed into health regen and Spectral Sickle and Spellthief’s Edge will have some of their health converted to mana regen for a more glass cannon build. Overall we think that by giving these items more defined stat profiles we can give the users a bit more of what they need. The second change we’re making for 10.1 is increasing the tier 3 quest goal so that we can **remove the farming penalty** once you reach tier 3. \r\n\r\n**Sylas Mechanics Changes**\r\nWe have some Sylas work coming to PBE for patch 10.1. The core goal here is to shift his mechanics in a way that open up some weaknesses for him in very high level play while making him a viable champ for the majority of players (it’s a buff overall). We’re combining a set of strategies that we think will lead to this outcome:\r\n\r\n* Less lane control, but significantly stronger late - having a safe, strong lane leads to being a strong option in all possible matchups. To counterbalance we’re buffing his late game across multiple axes (damage, tankiness, cooldowns)\r\n* Mid viability over jungle - Juggling multiple roles lead to an additional strength as a flex pick. We think we can get him to a healthier spot for mid lane if we don’t allow him to be a strong flex pick in jungle\r\n* Remove tools - E shield. Having a tool for every situation is something that can lead to this problem so we are going to remove the shield on E and give back the power in other places on the kit. \r\n* Lowering skill floor on passive and W - We want to soften a few of the optimizations that many players are struggling to access without pulling out the decisions and skills of experienced players entirely. \r\n\r\n**New Champion Release Pace**\r\nThe end of this year leading into next year will have a flurry of new champions (Senna, Aphelios, Sett). We are as excited as you about this, but our current goal is not to speed up the pace of new champions and VGUs. The way that we develop focuses on getting it right over hitting perfect deadlines, so sometimes projects can cluster together like these three. Expect things to slow down a bit and 2020 should be fairly similar to 2019 in terms of champion releases. \r\n\r\nA related note is that Senna -> Aphelios -> Sett I think are a good representation of our overall approach to champion complexity and difficulty going forward. We want to have a wide range of simple, complex, accessible, and difficult offerings for players of all types so we’re aiming to balance that throughout our new champions and VGUs in 2020. \r\n\r\n-Scruffy\r\n\r\nhttps://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/9.24.2/img/champion/Sion.png","replies":[{"poster":"pewnez","date":"2019-12-14T00:48:59.956+0000","up_votes":27,"down_votes":2,"body":"After reading and testing the new Sylas changes on the PBE,\nOverall i fail to see what these are going to accomplish and mind you that Riot meantioned them as \"it's a buff overall\" which they are clearly not.\n\nThe laning phase: \n- Yes he is now weak early game. His wave clear, which was already mediocre decreased considerably.He shines at skirmishes but he won't be able to clear the wave in a realistic time to do anything other than trying to survive and scale. \n- Less pressure overall, as his Q1 now does much less poke damage and minion damage and last he has much worse stats which naturally makes him weaker. \n- Mana wise,you need to be clever about the way you spend it, and that's fine and the way it should be but i feel like it's still a bit  too much comparing to other midlaners since his passive is on the weak side against minions. \n\nNow as Riot said: \"to counterbalance we’re buffing his late game across multiple axes (damage, tankiness, cooldowns) \"\n\nDamage: Yes it's higher, however his damage now it's a lot less reliable. You will need to accurately hit your E2, which means going for heavy trades. If you were used to do the E2+Q mechanic, that's not a thing anymore as it got removed. So the skill that does the most damage to champions NOW is also his engage tool (E2) which mind you, it's a skill with utility since it gap closes you into the enemy while also provinding a knockup. Awfull decision here, this ability shouldn't be doing this much damage as it makes him more burst oriented. Also removing skill expression after all this time is never welcome. It's a huge loss.\n\nTankiness: If you guys want Sylas to be a lategame champion that is totally fine and it will make him easier to balance which is a really good thing. The extra Armor/MR and HP he gets in the late stages of the game doesn't make up for the loss in the early game in addition to removing his shield mechanic, but it's a start i suppose.\n\nCooldowns: The new cooldowns are a LOT better. His new W will help him a lot in the late game to survive but it will continue to be his most obnoxious ability and probably the reason people tend to not like facing him. He will be able to cast a lot more E's aswell, but as previously meantioned he now can't do E2+Q combo so it feels like it would be a lot better to just switch the cooldown to it's previous state (14) and have this mechanic added back since it represents high risk, high reward in most scenarios and that's a good thing for what this champion represents.\n\nPassive: The 3 stacks of his passive will definetly help out many players but it doesn't realistic do anything to others that already got the grasp of how the kit works and functions. Speaking of this, he currently feels clunky to play as, because now he can't  auto attack reset with his passive after any ability, his W especially.I'm sure others will agree with this but if this changes go foward, he will loose a huge part of his identity and ironically he will be unable to use his new 3 max charges of his passive in a trade because it will take too long for him to do such combo.\n\nI can easily accept the changes to his Q and W, and it;s a wise decision to shift power from his early to his late game. However i won't stay silent when they are removing 2 really cool and unique mechanics Sylas has. Presenting this changes into making you believe they are a good thing and right after you find out through testing that some of the new weaknesses are not detailed in these changes like they should (aa resets with passive, E2+Q combo). Reading Quick Gameplay Thoughts and then playing him in the PBE didn't felt coherent..it truly felt misleading and i hope something can be done.\n\nSo, overall these changes managed to hit one of the goals Riot has which is, IT DOES open up a lot of weaknesses for him in very high level play and for the majority of players. These don't seem too attractive to Sylas players generally speaking and they are clearly not a buff overall. It's even absurd to think they are and to present them as if.\nSorry for my lack of control in the latest part of the comment, but in the end i have the same goal as people working at Riot. It hurts to see such an amazing champion to go down this path.","replies":[{"poster":"Amokiir","date":"2019-12-14T03:45:08.803+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for saying this.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"HommeGoujon","date":"2019-12-13T18:08:11.286+0000","up_votes":23,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hi,\nAny plan to fix the Client?

Urgot is my go-to top laner for whenever I just wanna chill in norms, have fun, and start blastin'. But in the preseason, it hasn't been the same playing Urgot. \n\nYou're forced to go into Conqueror as Urgot because no other rune gives you the essential sustain and damage. If you go PTA, you get damage and better harass in lane but without the sustain of Conq, your extended fighting capabilities are greatly reduced. Even with Death's Dance. The other rune that you could run on Urgot are Aftershock, which isn't ideal since you can only proc it with E, and you're not a champ that wants to haphazardly use your only hard CC. Conqueror nerfs hurt Urgot so hard because this is the only good rune he can take. \n\nNot to mention that Urgot already suffers from itemization due to being ranged. He can't build Sterak's Gage, which is a fantastic item for melee juggernauts/top laners. And being ranged means that the only rune he can take is weaker on him compared to a melee champion. And this also neglects that he can't really use some items effectively due to the on-hit penalty on his W.  \n\nHonestly, Urgot would be fine if at bare minimum, he got healed for a portion of damage dealt by his passive. Or if he got healed for executing enemies with his ultimate but I don't think that we should shift so much power onto his ult.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Enderized","date":"2019-12-13T18:48:08.312+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":4,"body":"Huge Problem i see regarding that is that Urgot is supposed to be a somewhat bruiser/juggernaut ... yet lacks access to like everything other champs of this class can buy due him being \"ranged\" ... 350 range :cough: -\n\nLike when other Bruisers can go Titanic for Waveclear and the active and such... what does Urgot have...?

I have 300k on him and loved the champion since release, i know possibly somebody else can have more mastery points but still 300 is not a small number. Been playing the champion since release, saw him being OP and then rightfully nerfed. Tested the current \"buffs\" on PBE for a few games. It feels like the champion has no cohesion anymore. His passive doesn't really interact with his kit anymore, because you never realistically have the time to use autos between spells. The champion is clearly not an assassin, as his uniqueness lies in stealing ults, something which is way better suited for a more bruiser-ish type of gameplay. I think the passive and Q changes are great, make Q reward a good use of it that manages to hit the target in the intersection point. Also lowering the passive range is great: it's harder to hit multiple people with it and it makes your positioning matter more. But then that's about it. I think there is no reason his E needs to have that high damage when the spell is his engage tool. You could've just left the E damage low and kept the auto reset, which by the way makes really no sense removing from either E or W.  Riven is a champion in the game, her animation canceling is accepted and understood, and Sylas BY DESIGN requires for you to know what every ult in the game does, so there's really no way he can be a beginner champion. I think the focus of the champion should be on his passive, it's fine if his spells don't deal absurd amounts of damage because with every spell he casts he gets a passive proc (2 stacks are already too many, he should be losing something if he chooses to spam all of his spells together for some burst without autoing between them). Overall i'd very much rather have current live Sylas with 45% Winrate than the one that is on PBE.

There is a reason why everyone in the community likes it. It really differentiates a good Sylas from a bad one. I'm totally okay with E shield removal, more scaling into the later game, and W changes that \"remove the skill floor on the W\", but the passive was fully functional as it is. It just needed a damage revert. So PLEEEEASE don't change the passive auto attack resets.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RekSai CoffeeCo","date":"2019-12-20T19:28:03.598+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Waiting on client fixes.\n\nWaiting on Nexus Blitz.\n\nWaiting on 3rd, 4th and 5th gamemode  with RGM thrown in (TFT doesn't count).\nWaiting on adjustment of solo lane experience to be balanced with jungle/duo lane.\n\nWaiting on Rito to get a clue how owning over half the  total champs should earn you a WHOLE reroll for ARAM always, not this 92-95% thing you got going on.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kata Ga Kill","date":"2019-12-16T06:24:08.713+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"PBE Sylas E High Base DMG + 100% AP Scaling.....\n\nAre u already again drunk?\n\nDidnt u already learn from your mistake with Galio Q 100% AP Scaling????","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Cane Master","date":"2019-12-14T14:39:36.967+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's been 10 years of having {{champion:75}}  in the same extremely binary state, so much so that it's boring to both play with and against him.
