I&#039;m just thinking that this should be updated. A total of 6 bans for 40-50 champs, ok thats pretty fair. Yet we have 127 champions now and only have a total of 6 bans still? i feel like this causes teams to only pick the same comps and champs over and over because if they do not pick/ban them, then the other team will just use them. Makes the game a bit stale when its the same kind of god tier picks being fought over. I say we increase the number of bans per game. They clearly were ok with having a higher ratio of 40/6 but now how about for the 127 champs we have like 10 bans, or even 8 would help. just my thoughts, im sure this has been brought up before.
