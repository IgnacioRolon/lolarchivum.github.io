It causes me to dc from games, and I have no idea how to fix. I play in borderless fullscreen with an Hp 23es monitor, more than capable of running the game at 1920x1080p.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-07T21:01:50.656+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm gonna side with Viper on this one actually. It sounds like your pc is unable to find that monitor randomly, and having to restart to get it working again isn't really the best way to go about things. I would try switching out that cable if possible, and also checking for any possible monitor drivers that might be able to help for that specific one.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheViper7911","date":"2017-07-07T00:31:43.606+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you have more than one monitor?

VGA, HDMI, DP.\n\nSo this randomly happens during game?\nHow do you resolve the issue, rebooting?\nWhat is your make model and specs, especially gfx card?\n\nI would first replace the monitor cable if you have a spare.\n\nAnother thing you can check is the hard drive light indicator if it has one. If there is no activity the system is frozen. Beyond that you need to start checking event logs to see if you have a hardware issue that is freezing up your system.\n\nHighly likely this is not a league client issue although it may be exacerbated by running the game.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
