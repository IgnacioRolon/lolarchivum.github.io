Send a support ticket or is this the problem with the game itself or not me...HALP","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-02T21:13:45.548+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you have an unstable connection, and it might be coincidence that it just happens during ranked.  Nevertheless, it's a sucky situation!  I suggest going over each step of the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to help strengthen whatever is causing your connection to champion select to degrade.  I also recommend using[ low-spec mode](https://i.gyazo.com/a39e12ca76e54359342203c476a0e9c1.png) just inn case any pc stress could get in the way.
