And that's saying something because you know, it's fucking Kat we're comparing him to?\n* You forgot that windwall has a fucking surface area, cast from Yasuo himself (hence most popularly used to \"block\" a spell that's ALREADY hit) so likely it has already blocked whatever critical spells you were just throwing at him, lingers around after being cast for some time, is omnidirectional, has a big ass hitbox, and all of the factors above that also play into the strength of the windwall with the sole exclusion of its CD which is the only saving grace from having Yasuo being completely broken.\n\n> No, those things are unrelated.\n> It literally requires a basic attack of any strength to make his shield a non-factor.\n> Ranged champions have a stupidly easy time removing his shield, unless he blocks the attempt with a Windwall and which point he loses twice at the same time.\n\nYou talk as if Yasuo is just a champ who nothing in his kit but a periodic shield.

Because all it says is that (background knowledge Yasuo's passive does not have a CD) you do not need 17 seconds to recharge it in low levels, and in high levels it doesn't need 10. It's more like 10 seconds in low levels, and whatever low number it is in high levels, as Yasuo is entirely able to regen his shield within the same teamfight without ulti in late game.\n\n.............\n\nAgain, the point isn't that shield is exclusively the problem, but rather a combination of all of his kit designs makes him utterly obnoxious with minuscule size of meaningful countering window for his opponents. The shield is just the icing on the cake and by far the easiest to target and address without simply remaking the damn champion from the ground up.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"iLBGAMing","date":"2017-10-29T18:11:55.854+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":4,"body":"I'm kinda glad that someone actually thinks about it instead of just simply saying yes that it's a bad idea.\n\nThanks for the opinion dude, appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"Poske","date":"2017-10-29T21:27:14.218+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=iLBGAMing,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=WWsXv3J3,comment-id=0001000000000000,timestamp=2017-10-29T18:11:55.854+0000)\n>\n> I&#x27;m kinda glad that someone actually thinks about it instead of just simply saying yes that it&#x27;s a bad idea.\n> \n> Thanks for the opinion dude, appreciated.\n\nThis idea has been suggested so many times\n\n\n0 times yasuo players responded positively\n\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"Sraeg2013","date":"2017-10-29T23:58:39.148+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":2,"body":"It's been suggested many times and only haters responded positively.","replies":[]},{"poster":"inplane","date":"2017-10-29T21:58:31.926+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Poske,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=WWsXv3J3,comment-id=00010000000000000000,timestamp=2017-10-29T21:27:14.218+0000)\n>\n> This idea has been suggested so many times\n> \n> \n> 0 times yasuo players responded positively\n\nOf course they're not going to respond positively.

Yasuo does not see as much pro play anymore because he is very easy to exploit/play around if your team is coordinated.\n\nWe are long gone from Yasuo being a strong pick at a pro level. \n\nJust because champions exist that are in a bad state (Ryze is questionable, but whatever), does not mean you should just dumpster another champion that is fine right now (sitting at 50% win rate top, and 49% win rate mid).\n\nFor fucks sake, Yasuo isnt even being played mid anymore. His most common role right now is top. And all this change would do is dumpster his midlane even more.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Anhartamin","date":"2017-10-30T15:21:30.592+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"RookPusher","date":"2017-10-30T15:24:58.943+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"*Then","replies":[{"poster":"Anhartamin","date":"2017-10-30T15:30:27.267+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"RookPusher","date":"2017-10-30T17:04:00.489+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://www.merriam-webster.com/","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Faceroll Tactics","date":"2017-10-30T11:43:21.243+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"Can we please just stop talking about yasuo?\n\nPast silver 5 he is absolute garbage, I’m sick of hearing about this “broken” champion all the time","replies":[{"poster":"Rıots Bad Client","date":"2017-10-30T12:15:31.438+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"what sounds like nerfs, might be a blessing in disguise for yas mains.

In that case, the armor pen on his ulti and his double crit passive would have to give as well. \n\nI don't know if you remember Tanksuo, but that shit was broken.
