At this point most people agree his ult should be a team bonus that works off of a bloodthirst theme, rather than just yet another steroid, and beyond that he could also use some updated basic abilities, as his E is boring and his W is not very healthy, with the whole package of manaless sustain and poke in lane making him a pain to deal with if he ever at all gets strong.\n\nMundo's a ball of stats. He's unique for having tons of regen, and that should stay, but it needs to stay in a manner that's properly interactive. Beyond that, he should probably trade off some of his current near-invulnerability for actual offensive power, as his biggest issue is that he's incentivized to build nothing but tank stats, and then deals so little damage of his own that nobody really cares about him. I feel he should still have steroids on his kit, but those steroids need to be made legitimately interesting, and should carry some form of counterplay, perhaps by associating negative effects to positive ones that can be exploited by his opponents.\n\nSkarner's Juggernaut Update work spruced him up a bit, but kept his Q and W, both of which are tremendously boring and not very interactive effects, and put a lot of his power into this very gimmicky innate. As a result, he either runs people over or just can't function, depending on how he gets kited. His E and ult are mostly fine, but he needs major updates to his 3 other abilities so that he actually gets options from them, and so that enemies can genuinely interact with him.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Malfectious","date":"2017-09-16T15:38:52.958+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:36}} Mundo fun...people play Mundo for fun","replies":[]},{"poster":"DunkinNoobs","date":"2017-09-16T15:37:15.515+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mundo becomes a much more interesting champion once you stop building him full tank every game.

First and foremost, Mundo's job is to dive and kill squishy carries; His healing/tankiness and speed are merely his tools for doing so. Full tank Mundo's damage falls off way too hard to do his job past 20 minutes and all you're left with is a meat shield that lacks the CC necessary to make the enemy care about him. \n\n{{item:3046}} is monstrous item on Mundo and I'm amazed so few people have figured it out. 45% AS and 30% crit to go with all the AD from your E gives you an insane amount of damage and both passives are very good on Mundo as well given his job is to chase down 1 target and beat them to death. It's on a very cheap item too; PD only costs 2600 gold so fitting it into your build is no trouble at all.
