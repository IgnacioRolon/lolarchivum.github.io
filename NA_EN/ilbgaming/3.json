Because it doesn't really deal damage, unless you have lots of AP but even then you need to be close to the enemy to apply the damage which is hard considering how most champions have tons of mobility now.\n\nAnd in terms of balancing this passive the scalings and values can always be changed to make this a balanced passive. The reason why I wish to see this as a passive is because Amumu is a character who is always sad, so making him passively cry would make sense in a way, but that's just my idea it might be a bad one.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MorgManBasher","date":"2017-11-23T10:40:40.530+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My main question honestly is why are his mana costs so high when he's already really bad as a champ.","replies":[{"poster":"iLBGAMing","date":"2017-11-23T11:08:21.444+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MorgManBasher,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=jNzrWKKl,comment-id=0006,timestamp=2017-11-23T10:40:40.530+0000)\n>\n> My main question honestly is why are his mana costs so high when he&#x27;s already really bad as a champ.\n\nThat's a good question.
