Faker is a very very good player player but he lacks in some skills that Bjersen we know has. One major example is that Bjersen is a shot caller on TSM I don't have any reason to think faker can do that. Where faker has the flashy skills and outplays, Bjersen has both where you can make a legit argument or at least theory that Bjersen is a more skilled player then faker just on that point alone.\n\nWith so many hidden skills in LoL that you can't see on the surface it makes it hard to say who is better at what.","replies":[{"poster":"Vixanys","date":"2015-04-08T14:24:04.724+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Have you seen some of TSMs late game calls....when they are Even or Behind?

You can be the best laner in the world but if you can't position in a teamfight then that is skill you don't know. That an obvious example but after that skills get less obvious or are more hidden skills as I like to call them.\n\nYour question was \"who is better?\" not \"who is better 1v1?\"","replies":[{"poster":"Vixanys","date":"2015-04-08T16:23:12.237+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Once again, your entire argument is bypassing the focus of the Topic. Who is better. Not which team is better.  You are implying that the OP wants to know Which Team is better.\n\nAnd yes, team skills are important, but that is not what you are implying. You originally said the reason this clash between players is balanced because of Bjergsen's Shot-Calling. That is not his positioning, and only marginally affects him at all. Most of this shot calling affects the rest of the team, WHICH IS NOT THE POINT OF THIS TOPIC. So it can only provide an extremely shallow impact on this topic.\n\nWe could also say that Faker is better because he consistently has to play with a shit team (most of Season 4 and beginning of Season 5), but since we are not focusing on teams contributions and are instead focusing on the players themselves. We will not include either of our points.\n\nFaker is better than Bjergsen. Bjergsen brings a lot to TSM and is an extremely potent player. Faker brings an insane amount of things to SKT T1 and is considered the best player in the world. Anyway you look at it Faker is better than Bjergsen. \n\nThank you for the debate and I agree with you that it is a team game, but this conversation is not about the teams. Just two individuals. And it should focus as such.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Trídent","date":"2015-04-07T04:01:36.452+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Faker would pwn as {{champion:6}} adc","replies":[{"poster":"Arahant","date":"2015-04-07T04:03:07.560+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Aye you know it m8 thought so too!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"UnitedYugoslavia","date":"2019-06-14T20:11:45.845+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"IMO Bjergsen is the best player ever.
