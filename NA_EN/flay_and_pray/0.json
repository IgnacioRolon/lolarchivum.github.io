I'm going to go through the changes now and explain now:\n\nPassive - I am extremely disappointed riot didn't take a look at this passive. Whille a new one could still retain him gaining mana back, this is one of hue he least interactive and boring passives in the game.\n-------\nQ - Baleful Strike\nChanged to a skill shot that stops on the second unit hit\nGrants 1 AP for each unit killed\nRange increased to 850 from 650\nCooldown changed to 7/6.5/6/5.5/5 from 8/7/6/5/4 \n\nThis is the first good change on this list. It makes him risk something to use his q while buffing its potential and giving him team fighting capabilities. \n------------\nR - Primordial Burst\nAP Ratio reduced to 1.0 from 1.2 (Ratio on enemy's AP unchanged)\nMana Cost flattened to 125 at all ranks from 125/175/225\nCooldown reduced to 120/100/80 from 130/110/90\n\nThis is where things start to get bad. The mana cost and CDR reduction change are fine, but lowering the ratio is unnecessary especially due to the change below. Mid and early game with that damage nerf he will rely on landing a W Q and R to kill someone, which is impossible due to the change below. Which is the main problem\n---------------\nE - Event Horizon\nHas a 0.75 second delay with a warning particle before the walls appear\nMana Cost decreased to 80/85/90/95/100 from 80/90/100/110/120\nCooldown reduced to 18/17/16/15/14 from 20/19/18/17/16\nRange increased to 700 from 650\n\nRiot, after all do the creative ideas you could have done to completely change the ability, you gave it a delay and called it a day. I'm sure this looks fine on paper but think about it. Almost every Veigar caught people out at max range with this ability due to its short range. Now with the delay it's IMPOSSIBLE for him to catch people out, which in and of itself isn't a bad thing. However, his W is 100% reliant on landing his E. The circle is way too large to trap someone in it and somehow land a w. This combined with the ult ratio nerfs will makes I'm not able to do his job. \n----------------\nAnother note, Veigar now has no way of defending himself from assassins or tower dives. He will put down his E and any champ with mobility will simply kill him before the walls even come up. \n-------------\nW - Dark Matter\nMana Cost reduced to 70/75/80/85/90 from 70/80/90/100/110\nCooldown reduced to 10/9.5/9/8.5/8 from 10 at all ranks\n\nBut it's alright we got a lower cooldown on W. 10/10\n----------\nConclusion/TLDR: \nThe changes make Veigar never able to land W, the ult damage nerfs are unnecessary, and the E change makes it impossible to catch people out or peel for himself. He will basically be completely useless VS assassins and not to mention tanks that are locking him down. I am severely disappointed with this rework and hope Riot gives him some form of staying alive or just completely change the E ability, which I think they should of done in the first place.\n\nThese changes keep his damage the same, but make it IMPOSSIBLE for him to use his W. Which is a big problem. If riot somehow makes him able to land it more consistently without making it broken, I would be so happy. \n\nKEEP IN MIND: I realize this is PBE and things change, I am basing this post around what they said specifically about number changes.\n","replies":[{"poster":"Waawee","date":"2015-02-13T15:31:14.781+0000","up_votes":45,"down_votes":3,"body":"This is what the changes look like to me:\n\n\"Veigar lost a lot of burst with the removal of dfg, therefore, we are increasing the cooldown of his q late game, reducing his ult's ratio and adding a delay on his stun so high mobility assassins like leblanc and zed can burst him down before the stun can even land.

Every single person on the forums cried out that it was a nerf and honestly the change to Veigar's Q alone warrants a lot of caution. \n\nIt could easily allow him to actually lane against many things.

Katarina's Shunpo has the same range as Veigar's buffed E will have.\nSlow or not, Katarina (and other dash/blink champions) are going to wipe the floor with Veigar if something isn't done to prevent them from abusing the E delay. Well... They already do wreck Veigar, in most cases (mobility), but at least the current non-delayed E gives Veigar a chance to save himself or even turn the tables.

If they're looking to buff him, that might be a place to start. It's confusing when someone jumps through the wall, then lands stunned on the other side.

Late game is becomes impossible for him to catch out squishys due to his low range, banshee veils, merc treads, tanks, and hard engage supports. Even if he can he bursts one person and leaves. Mid game is where he is most powerful for his roaming potential and ability to burst people before they get tanky.","replies":[{"poster":"Junkο","date":"2015-02-13T17:39:34.509+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Or you can build Seraph so you actually have a chance of surviving when somebody jumps on you.

I'm just bored enough to experiment some different ways to build him.\n\nI learned this build from DaBox a challenger Veigar only main. Look at Veigar this way: he doesn't have a weak early game, just a higher chance to snowball. If you only q farmed as Veigar until you ran out of mana you would get around 17 AP. That is, if you get most of them. 17 AP really isn't that much for the cost of letting your laner roam for free and be full health. What I do instead is use most, if not all of my Q's to poke the enemy laner down. They do a TON of damage due to its low cooldown and high base. At 6 especially against AP laners this usually translates into a kill. When doing this I start flask, and take MS quints, as they allow me easier roaming and dodging skillshots to run up Q and run back. I then usually get a zhonyas against assassins or burst mages or a morellonomicom if I'm running  out of mana quickly and have to stay in lane. From there build regular AP items such as Rabadons, Zhonyas, Sorc boots, and for last item you can even pick up another morello. Even without Q farming much at all I get around 120 free AP. Just remember, once you have a steady mana regeneration or blue buff you can q farm.","replies":[{"poster":"Terff","date":"2015-02-13T20:24:56.750+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well have fun poking with Q now that its a skillshot.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GummyBearWookiee","date":"2015-02-13T18:13:34.739+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Hurny Quilva,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=7JYupVgw,comment-id=000700000000000000000000,timestamp=2015-02-13T17:52:13.977+0000)\n>\n> Just curious but what do you build on Veigar?

Honestly...if you're excellent at farming with your Q...you could flat out skip D-Cap.  Yes it's a HUGE damage boost...but being more rounded overall could wind up being more beneficial pushing the D-Cap to a late game luxury item.  For instance you can go Mobas/Sorcs, Zhonyas, Abyssal Scepter, Rylai's Crystal Scepter, Void Staff, and a Banshee's Veil.  Could be fun...and you'd be a decently tanky mage in team fights to pop off more AOE W's and Q's.\n\nHeck...play around with a Rylai's and a Liandry's and a Death cap...throw in a Void and a Will of the Ancients and go to town.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Crett","date":"2015-02-13T20:51:47.681+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Flay and Pray,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=7JYupVgw,comment-id=00070000000000000000,timestamp=2015-02-13T17:50:10.236+0000)\n>\n> Currently, even with Seraphs you will die.

Veigar isn't even used in competitive but they ARE nerfing him. His stun is a nerf. There is a large area where his stun wont hit you, also the actual area of the inner part of the circle is so large that you can side-step his Dark Matter before it falls in the 1.25 second delay.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Flay and Pray","date":"2015-02-14T05:47:37.436+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=TwoD,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=7JYupVgw,comment-id=001f,timestamp=2015-02-14T04:42:45.987+0000)\n>\n> You're dumb if you think it didn't solve anything. with this change {{champion:45}} can be more flexible with his rotation and gameplay.

If that wasn't enough I have in fact watched and played the new Veigar. I feel like his E is completely laughable in almost every situation, it needs some sort of effect inside of the cage to give enemies a choice to either stay inside to leave it. He has no method of escape, engage, or peel after these changes, not to,mention they made his damage less reliable, his w impossible to land and reduced his only reliable ability. Everything about this rework is wrong, especially in the current assassin meta.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Akesgeroth","date":"2015-02-14T02:04:50.040+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Veigar got straight up nerfed because he's not a LCS BIG PLAYS champion.\n\nAt this rate they should just delete every champion without mobility since they're so damn intent on making them all unviable.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Ellimiist","date":"2015-02-13T23:16:51.224+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ummm wtf.
