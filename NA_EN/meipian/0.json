I had an emergency and was forced to leave a game a few days ago (something I haven't done in a long, long time. Today, I que up and get in a game. I pick Kata and get massive visual bugs and then my game crashes which also crashed windows explorer. After my computer crashes and I get back in the game at minute 10. After about 2 minutes, my computer blue screens it takes another 10 minutes to get into the game and the game crashes again after about a minute. What should I do? This is the first time that my computer has done this (to my knowledge but 4 year history is a while), will I get ban for leaving 2 games in a row? I get being punished for the first one but what can I do about the second one?\r\n\r\nCan a rioter please help me or tell me what I can do","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-19T23:49:13.159+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You won't be banned for leaving a game, but you receive a [leaverbuster](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ) penalty.
