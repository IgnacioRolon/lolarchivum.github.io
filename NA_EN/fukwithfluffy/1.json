In ARAM.\nThe game was practically already over so I told him there was no point in surrendering. ARAM games normally barely last 15 minutes anyway so there's really no point. After he afked every time I told him to get back into the game, he spammed 'but its aram' in all caps.\n'Its ARAM' isn't an excuse you troll, feed, afk, or otherwise throw the game for your team. If you're not going to play/try to win, then don't play at all. I've been against obviously trolling 5 man premades in norms who try harder than most people who play ARAM.","replies":[]}]}
