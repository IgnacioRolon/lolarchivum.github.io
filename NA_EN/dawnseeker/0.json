I'd like a more permanent fix to the game itself or a workaround so i don't have to rely on playing on an external monitor.\r\n\r\ntl;dr, How do i fix the tiny mouse issue without giving answers of 'use a different screen/resolution', since I already mentioned above.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-18T21:22:21.365+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"4K isn't fully supported yet, so you may run into issues like this.  Unfortunately, I don't have further suggestions to provide beyond changing your resolution.  You can hit us up in a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) to see if our tech team can find some options specific to you.","replies":[{"poster":"DW4RD3N","date":"2017-12-11T10:42:34.639+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Porocles, could you please elaborate on why this is the case? We don't need everything to be fixed about 4K. Could care less about fully supporting the quirks. The mouse cursor is the only thing standing in the way of 4K being playable and it seems like the problem has a trivial fix.\n\nThere are a lot of players who are facing this same issue (some waiting for 3 years) and I think it would really help lower their frustration if someone could tell them why it is so hard for Riot to find a solution to this problem. \nThis doesn't mean to make a pointer with 4x as many pixels. You could just upscale it to 4K while keeping the quality the same, or allow us to change the pointer to a different icon that's brighter and allows for better visibility.\n\nI appreciate your help.

Even full screened 1280x800 it still was about as small as ever with lower detail.\nChanging the mouse scheme to large or extra large had no effect.","replies":[]}]}]}
