I recently got my smurf account on which I main Cass to Diamond: http://www.lolking.net/summoner/na/43126641. \n\nI highly enjoy her playstyle and love the uniqueness that she brings to the game. That said, the rework changed several things, both good and bad. The goal of this post is to provide my own thoughts on the rework and how to improve the current Cass.\n\nI'll start by discussing the old Cassiopeia. She was probably the strongest lane bully in the game due to her insane level 2/3 DPS and incredible zoning power. People would either max Q or E depending on personal playstyle and the matchup. Maxing Q can be really oppressive since it's a spammable 3 second CD, high damage nuke, and that's on top of her E spam. Maxing E would make all-ins always favor her if she lands her poison. Her weaknesses are that her range was a huge limiting factor to how she can be played in teamfights and that she had little mobility to maneuver her around in engages (which also made her very vulnerable to ganks). She had to rely on her off-the-charts DPS and ultimate to maintain her presence throughout the game. The old Cassiopeia was really strong in the damage and laning department, but had some \"clunkiness\" to her kit -- namely that her E is not very responsive and does not reset its CD when it should have. It was occasionally unreliable and people sometimes preferred to focus on her Q spam harass instead.\n\nThe rework had one main goal in mind: nerf her bullying power and emphasize her as an extremely high DPS mage. While I like the idea of the rework and some of the refinements Riots made, there are some parts that I feel Riot could've done better on. \n\n**What I *LIKE* about the rework: **\n1. Her E feels much better to use. This was a much needed change to make her DPS reliable.\n2. She gets access to mana restore and spell vamp without items. Restoring mana with E last hits helps with her farming a lot and synergizes with her new passive. Spell vamp is always good on Cass since doing high single target DPS is what she does best, but previously she had issues with itemizing a {{item:3152}}  since often times she would rather by straight up damage, mana or {{item:3116}} .\n3. Her ultimate cooldown reduction was a good change to increase her mid game presence. \n4. The extra movement speed she gets from Q improves her kiting potential and makes her feel more like a carry.\n\n**What I* DISLIKE* about the rework:**\n1. Q's cooldown increases by a flat 1 second at all ranks and then drops back to 3 seconds after you get 200 passive stacks. That feels insulting to be honest; you make the 25% cooldown reduction look awesome but in reality, it merely changed Q's cooldown to pre-nerf status and Q is Cass' only spell that significantly benefits from CDR (granted, a ~1 min ult is nice for more late game uptime). If Riot wanted to nerf her Q's early game bullying power, then reducing its base damage and have its cooldown decrease with rank would be enough.\n2. Her E now costs 90 mana costs at max rank; this is very limiting especially that she not longer has a passive that reduces mana costs. This change FORCES her to buy a {{item:3070}} or a {{item:3027}} or else she has no way to dish out her DPS in teamfights.\n3. While she gets free AP from her passive, it FEELS bad to get AP her on her because of her harshly nerfed AP ratios on all skills besides her E. Her ratios needed to be nerfed because of the free deathcap passive, but I feel that some ratios shouldn't be as low as they are now. I would rather Riot decrease base damage to increase her ratios so it feels good when you get a lot of AP on her.\n\nI've spent some time thinking about her numbers and possible changes. Here is what I imagine what an improved Cass looks like:\n\n**Passive: Aspect of the Serpent**\nMechanisms to garner stacks (poisoning enemy champions, E'ing enemy champions, and killing poisoned units) remain unchanged.\n\nNew AP scaling mechanism: Grants 1% bonus AP per 15 stacks (for comparison, this is +26% AP at 400 stacks). Caps at 450 stacks.\n*I prefer a constant AP scaling passive rather one that upgrades at certain cutoffs because it would feel better to gain stacks on her*\n\n75 stacks: Spell Vamp on E unchanged\n\n175 stacks: Cassiopeia gains 15% Cooldown Reduction\n*My changes involve that her Q has decreased cooldown with rank. 25% CDR would make it ridiculously low. More importantly, giving only 15% CDR makes the player not feel as bad for building a CDR item (namely Grail or Morellonomicon)*\n\n375 stacks: Twin Fang gains 75 (or 50 -- I'm not too familiar with balance in the range department) cast range\n*The one thing that's preventing Cass from being a true late game teamfighting carry is her range. Unlike ADCs, she has to do something additional (land her poison) to dish out her DPS. It's very mechanical challenging to do this along with positioning and kiting. Giving her a bit of extra range (but not too much) for late game makes her carry identity much more realistic and reliable while being fair*\n\n**Q: Noxious Blast**\nBase damage reduced from ~~75/115/155/195/235~~ to 60/90/120/150/180\nAP ratio increased from ~~0.45~~ to 0.6\nCooldown decreased at later ranks from 4/~~4/4/4/4~~ to 4/3.75/3.5/3.25/3\n\n*Again, I dislike the idea of giving her incredibly high AP only to harshly nerf her AP ratios. 0.6 ratio is more in line with similar abilities (Q abilities from {{champion:61}} {{champion:30}} {{champion:134}} ). The base damage is reduced to balance this for early game, especially that the cooldown gets reverted to 3 at max rank for more mid game power. Buffing her Q for mid/late game also reinforces her identity as a poison mage.*\n\n**W: Miasma**\nBase damage increased from 10~~/15/20/25/30~~ to 10/20/30/40/50\nAP ratio increased from~~ 0.1~~ to 0.15\nCooldown INCREASED at earlier ranks from ~~14/13/12/11/~~10 to 16/14.5/13/11.5/10\n\n*Even for an utility spell, the base damage scaling on this spell is just flat out atrocious. I feel that a bit more base damage is needed to make this spell feel good to rank up on later in the game (since Cass almost always max this spell last). AP ratio is increased so this spell doesn't do horribly low damage even with 1000 AP. To compensate, the cooldown is increased for early-mid game (along with the decreased CDR gained for passive) to promote more careful usage of this spell since its slow is pretty strong and should be used timely.*\n\n**E: Twin Fang\nMana cost changed from 30/45/60/75/90 to 40/45/50/55/60\n\n*Honestly, I have no clue why Riot decided to pigeonhole every Cass into buying either Rod of Ages or Tear with those absurd mana costs. With this change, higher rank 1 mana cost also makes it more risky to try to aim for the level 2 cheese kill. *\n\nR: Petrifying Gaze\nAP ratio increased from ~~0.5~~ to 0.65\nCooldown decreased from ~~120/110/100~~ to 115/105/95\n*\nThis may sound weird, but it sucks to see that you have over 1k AP and your ultimate still doesn't do 1k damage. Even though Twin Fang is your primary source of damage by far, this ultimate's damage still needs to feel like an ultimate's damage. Slightly increasing the AP ratio achieves this goal rather well without going overboard since she does have insane DPS. Cooldown is decreased by 5 seconds to partially offset the lessened CDR gain from the passive.*\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\nSo these are my thoughts on the current Cassiopeia. @Riot: I may not have the numbers right, but please consider my ideas to improve her current gameplay.\n\nAMA on the topic of Cassiopeia!","replies":[{"poster":"ImpendingDeath","date":"2014-10-13T23:59:13.740+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"Better solution: get rid of this god awful passive, restore Cassiopeia to pre-rework status, and give her the more finely tuned E reset that she needed.","replies":[{"poster":"Bernkastar","date":"2014-10-14T06:33:54.754+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":7,"body":"> Better solution: get rid of this god awful passive, restore Cassiopeia to pre-rework status, and give her the more finely tuned E reset that she needed.\n\nNo. People who say this obviously have not played enough pre-rework Cass to understand that she was reworked PRIMARILY because of her disgusting early game bullying power. Even though I love playing Cass, that power needed to be gone. She was intentionally kept as a highly niche pick because, whenever she was competitively viable, she would be absolutely ruthless in lane.","replies":[{"poster":"ImpendingDeath","date":"2014-10-14T11:12:49.622+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":2,"body":"This is a gross exaggeration of Cass's actual capabilities.

I play at Diamond and Master level and even here, pre-rework Cass was by far one of the biggest lane bullies if you knew how to play her. She is intentionally kept as one of the most mechanically difficult champions to learn, but once you get past that you can bully almost anyone in lane, which I have been doing. \n\nAlso, are people seriously downvoting King Cobra, arguably the best Cass main in NA, and upvoting blatant misconceptions?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Skia Asteri","date":"2014-10-15T03:47:06.181+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"> This is a gross exaggeration of Cass's actual capabilities.

Her Q is easily avoidable if you're paying attention. People who think she was a monstrous lane bully didn't know how to play against her very well.\n\nNo, it is actually one of the major reasons why you never saw Cassio changes before the rework. Her bullying power was on par with Syndra (who is widely regarded as the premier lane bully in midlane right now). However, unlike Syndra, Cassio scaled into late game very well if she had a team to protect her.\n\nUnfortunately, due to how unreliable her kit was (mainly ultimate and Twin Fangs) and due to the fact that her itemization was really wonky, she very rarely saw competitive play. The only people who would pick her are those who enjoyed playing her. She didn't have a strategic niche because champions like Ryze and Karthus fulfilled her role better and with more reliability.\n\n\n\nWith the rework, Riot took away her oppressive laning and gave her an INSANE lategame. I would argue she's far and away the best late game champion in the game right now. It's disgusting. \n\nThe only problem I see with the rework is that for many players it is far too hard to get to that late game. I have an unreasonable amount of games as Cassiopeia and thus I'm incredibly comfortable playing for that goal and acquiring stacks efficiently. In my opinion, Riot only needs to make some very very fine tuning to her passive to make it more accessible to people who don't main the hell out of Cass.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Biooutbreak","date":"2014-10-14T18:56:55.609+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"@godkarthusna - do you stream?\n@kingcobra - when are you gonna stream?\n\nother than that i pretty much of the opinion that more tuning and testing is all that's needed. would you two say the best complimentary junglers for cass ones with lockdown, say j4/amumu, or ones that have better peel, like say rammus/maokai, or even secondary threats, like kha'zix, or maybe an early pressure jungler like lee/shaco? i know team/ enemy comps plays apart, but in general.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot King Cobra","date":"2014-10-14T19:20:32.421+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"> @godkarthusna - do you stream?\n> @kingcobra - when are you gonna stream?\n> \n> other than that i pretty much of the opinion that more tuning and testing is all that's needed. would you two say the best complimentary junglers for cass ones with lockdown, say j4/amumu, or ones that have better peel, like say rammus/maokai, or even secondary threats, like kha'zix, or maybe an early pressure jungler like lee/shaco? i know team/ enemy comps plays apart, but in general.\n\nI'm trying to make time to stream, but I have a lot of work to do because grad school takes over lives... :|\n\nJunglers with hard engage are the best junglers to pair with Cassio so J4, Amumu, Maokai, Rammus, etc. are all excellent picks. Early pressure junglers work well with Cassio as well if they snowball her or another lane because they have potential to take over the mid/early game which allows Cassio to scale to late game and take over from there. \n\nJunglers that don't do well with Cassi are farm heavy ones like Master Yi, Shyvana, etc. With Cassio, you don't need anymore hard carries on the team. High damage bruisers like Kha'Zix, Irelia, etc. that HAVE to be focused in team fights or super tanky champions that can be meatshields/CC bots for Cass are the best. The first group basically act as distractions while you burn down the frontline and the other acts as peelers for you.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kowe The Ewok","date":"2014-10-14T16:24:11.996+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"So you mean to say 1HKO'ing enemies and reliable on ult AoE stuns are bad ladgame?

In late game teamfights, you can bet whoever gets ulted by Syndra will instantly be summoner heal'd, Mikael's Crucible'd, Locket'd, etc. AND they will probably have Banshee's or Zhonya's to mitigate additional damage. It is widely known she falls off late game like all burst mages do. Sure, she brings stuns and SOME DPS in the form of low cooldown Qs, but she mainly becomes a stun bot.\n\nThe new late game Cassio has HUGE survivability. I don't know why people seem to struggle with this. Late game she's healing for over 100 HP per Twin Fang (which is huge compared to AD's life steal), usually has ~3000 health (if you went RoA + Rylais) or 2400 + Seraph's Shield, a perma-slow from Rylais', Zhonya's active, AND whatever summoners and actives her team has available. If you are getting 1 shot as late game new Cass, you are REALLY messing up somewhere.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Serpents Embrace","date":"2014-10-14T16:26:22.940+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey,\n\ni totally agree on all of the things you said!
