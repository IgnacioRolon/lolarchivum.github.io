I do not consider SKT because it was forced to be made, and to me it&#039;s not even that great. There are a lot of great Zed skins out there like PROJECT: Zed, Justicar Zed, etc. There are a lot of great ideas for him but they are just ideas. It&#039;s almost been 3 years since Zed has been out...","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-06-28T15:43:28.198+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":2,"body":"Hey Draygen,\n\nWhile it technically hasn't been too long since his last skin (STK, I know, I know, it's legacy), it hasn't been as long as other champions have been waiting, such as Zac (yay, he finally has skin**s**!)\n\nWhen we create skins, we have several main goals, depending on what we're looking to do with a skin.\n\n* The first is obviously to create an awesome skin.\n\n* To create a thematic of skins (Marauder/Warden). In a case like this, we're looking for champions that could fill that thematic space. (This also applied to events such as Harrowing, Lunar Revel, etc). \n\nOne thing to note here is that if we have a skin planned for a holiday, you likely wouldn't see a skin for x champion until then.  Let's say we made a Harrowing skin for Zed; you wouldn't see a skin for him until October, but the skin would be appropriately placed due to thematic. \n\n* To create a skin for a champion who hasn't had a skin in a long time (aaaand isn't on the list of reworks - like Taric). \n\nChromas don't mean that champion is out of the running for a skin for another two years. As you've seen with Zac, a champion can get chromas and a skin at the same time. \n\nI like your ideas for Zed skins - they take up different fantasies that his base doesn't fulfill, and that's the goal of a skin. :]","replies":[{"poster":"UncIe Zed","date":"2015-06-28T15:52:11.412+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello, KateyKhaos\n\nThank you so much, finally a rioter who answer us complaining about a new zed skin, but you cant say anything about how much time we will have to wait to see the next zed skin ? or plz just give a hint or something tricky so that we have to search and to get hyped :D, will it be awesome, exeptional, or kinda meh ? somthing is in production ?\n\nThank you for your answer\n\nUncle Zed","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-06-28T15:53:35.993+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Unfortunately, I'm not able to say anything about what may or may not be in production.
