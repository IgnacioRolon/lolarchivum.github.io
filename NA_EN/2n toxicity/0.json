Like i&#039;ve been against and with it, and it&#039;s honestly nasty. If you havn&#039;t tried it, get a poppy main and tell them to come bot lane with  you. I&#039;ve first experienced it 6 months ago and it still a nasty underground op thing.

Works hilariously well when they do, but poorly if they understand how to to wreck themselves.

If you're forcing plays with flash theres plenty of other strong bot lane choices.","replies":[]}]}
