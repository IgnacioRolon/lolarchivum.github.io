This will be on the account: Khodo, (NA servers) so feel free to dig into it yourself. This is going to be a very long rant so don't bother reading it if you don’t have anything constructive or nice to say.\r\n\r\nAlright, to begin I'll introduce myself, My names Noah and I’m 18 years old. I’m not a veteran league player as I only joined recently in season 7 just before the Darius VS Garen event. I want to share my side to the community and hopefully get my account back someday. Now on to the matter at hand. Over the past couple of months I have properly gone through the banning system of Summoner's code, 10 game > 25 game > 2 week > permanent suspension. By all means I will say this now, I broke the rules and a ban is necessary. What I’ll be arguing is the amount of ban. \r\n\r\nI’ve always been an outspoken kid, saying the first thing that comes to mind, no filter, If I’m upset you’ll know it. I’ll say it now though, I’m not a liar. I’ve received a permanent ban before. On this account as well. And I know that statement alone is worth not unbanning me now, but I care too much to just let it go so here's my story: I received my first ban cause I was an asshole prick. I look back at my logs now and was kind of amazed and how much I have changed. I was using words like %%%%%%, gay, %%%%%% and a variety of words you’d expect from a angry goblin. I don’t remember the guy who offered me a second chance but he did and I’ll be thankful to that guy cause he changed me as a person outside of League as well. As of today I'm much more sensitive and caring. Now after this ban I changed, I never got immensely better but I was good enough. I muted before things got out of hand and kept my nose tucked in and for almost a year, I went without any ban. Pretty recently I went through a tough time, Graduation. I was getting kicked out and as I look back on it now, I was a bit more tempered during this transition. By no means is this an excuse but this translated into game time and I slowly ended up climbing the ban ladder again. \r\n\r\nAfter my two week ban I really broke down. I looked inward and sought counselling help for my personal issues. After my two weeks ban was up I was in a better spot and was playing this game again. I lost a lot of friends in my transition though so I ended up playing a lot of solo games and I couldn't say with a bigger smile that I was having fun. I don’t know why, but I was enjoying this game again like it was my first time. If you take the effort to look at some of my games I wishing people merry Christmas, having fun with fellow League players, trying new builds and characters, etc. I made some good friends that I still know on discord currently and I was enjoying the game for what it was made for; entertainment. Anyways, this doesn't mean that everything is perfect of course, I still had a bad game here and there but I was trying to be better, not for anyone but myself. \r\n\r\nI was bantering, KEY WORD BANTERING, with the enemy team and overall my experience was at a high. After what is Game 1 on my reported chat logs I got a permanent ban and was suspended. \r\n\r\nOf course I went to appeal it but through multiple tries over the course of this month through different riot staff members, each one mentioned that it was impossible for them to help me regardless of the reasoning behind my ban. My most recent talk with a certain support staff recommended for my final attempt was to seek help through the forums.\r\n\r\nOkay, this has been long but here are my chat logs and the brackets are my comments through them:\r\n\r\nGame 1\r\nIn-Game\r\nKhodo: where the people are shitty and the staff are also shitty\r\nKhodo: dumb bitch\r\nKhodo: jahseh onfroy wont let you\r\nKhodo: ur mom\r\nKhodo: has\r\nKhodo: hepatitis\r\n(said that in all chat as i was joking around with the enemy ryze mid laner who I was camping, he was joking back with comments similar to these as well)\r\nKhodo: nice\r\nKhodo: my lux is\r\nKhodo: i bet you come last place in kahoot\r\nKhodo: ow\r\nKhodo: come\r\nKhodo: shaco\r\nKhodo: jajajajajaja\r\nKhodo: dumb\r\nKhodo: beta\r\nKhodo: bitch\r\nKhodo: uses ghost\r\nKhodo: mega head\r\nKhodo: garbage team\r\n(I was joking as we were fed and the score was like 13-0 for us)\r\nKhodo: what can i say\r\nKhodo: ur team ofc\r\n(covered it up by connecting and saying there team was the garbage team)\r\nKhodo: ha\r\nKhodo: ha\r\nKhodo: ha\r\nKhodo: ha\r\nKhodo: ha\r\nKhodo: hja\r\nKhodo: jajajajajajajajajajajajajaja\r\nKhodo: thats me\r\nKhodo: at you\r\nKhodo: right now\r\nKhodo: omg\r\nKhodo: my ego\r\nKhodo: its gonna go super siayan\r\nKhodo: i fuz ur mom\r\nKhodo: fuq*\r\nKhodo: mb\r\nKhodo: i just took ur viginity\r\n(more jokes with ryze mid laner)\r\nKhodo: im gonna\r\nKhodo: do it\r\nKhodo: again\r\nKhodo: lmao\r\nKhodo: u scared\r\nKhodo: gimme a hot min\r\nKhodo: i gotta kill gnar first\r\nKhodo: hes next\r\nKhodo: worth\r\nKhodo: cuz ur bad\r\nKhodo: big dummy\r\nKhodo: what did my mom say\r\nKhodo: no\r\nKhodo: stfu\r\nKhodo: dont tell me what do do\r\n(this was me telling my teammate signed to stfu because he was being mean and didn't like me to stfu, not good on my part)\r\nKhodo: YEAH\r\nKhodo: IM ABOUT TO GO SUPER SAIYAN\r\nKhodo: AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH\r\nKhodo: RIUGFHT ON THE BEAT TOO\r\nKhodo: i think i nutted\r\nKhodo: omg i wish there was 2 of me so i could fuck my twin\r\nKhodo: im the perfect human male\r\nKhodo: im having to much fun for me threating to run it down in champ select wtf\r\n(i threatened to dodge or lose in champ select because i wanted to leave and eat my pizza)\r\nKhodo: OMG\r\nKhodo: SUPER SIAYAN NUMBER TWO\r\nKhodo: well\r\nKhodo: stop feeding\r\nKhodo: dummy\r\nKhodo: i totally get that feeling\r\nKhodo: okay\r\nKhodo: lets run it back real quick\r\nKhodo: my pizz rolls are out of the overn\r\nKhodo: yes\r\nKhodo: AHHH\r\nKhodo: somehow\r\nKhodo: thats my shit lux's fault\r\nKhodo: terrible player\r\n(I died, making a funny joke out saying “somehow” even though she was at base no where near me)\r\nKhodo: OKAY\r\nKhodo: ANOTHER ONE\r\nKhodo: WE GOING IN\r\nKhodo: shut the fuck up and mute me whore\r\n(I imagined as a sassy attitude because singed was spamming me to shut up but not good I know)\r\nKhodo: im ur carry\r\n(I was 24/3)\r\nKhodo: why report me\r\nKhodo: well\r\nKhodo: Watch this\r\nKhodo: xd\r\nKhodo: real shit\r\nKhodo: im havign a lot of fun right now\r\nKhodo: if u dont have me muted yet say \"gamers rise up\"\r\nKhodo: cool\r\nKhodo: kaisa\r\nKhodo: im gonna kill you\r\nKhodo: oof\r\nKhodo: hate that pyke stun\r\nKhodo: dont take baron without me\r\nKhodo: im on my way\r\nKhodo: oh\r\nKhodo: ur not doing it\r\nKhodo: better players win\r\nKhodo: oof\r\nKhodo: Sad reality\r\nKhodo: im trash\r\nKhodo: anotha one\r\nKhodo: okay\r\nKhodo: ryze\r\nKhodo: im on my way\r\nKhodo: okay\r\nKhodo: fuck\r\nKhodo: didnt wanna do that\r\nKhodo: well\r\nKhodo: WHAT\r\nKhodo: MY OENTA????\r\nKhodo: Xd\r\nKhodo: what happened\r\nKhodo: i thot i killed all 5\r\nKhodo: i have HIV\r\nKhodo: the game knows\r\nKhodo: reported riot games for negative attitiude\r\nKhodo: hey yummi\r\nKhodo: im very upset\r\nKhodo: why\r\nKhodo: wanna tlak about it\r\nKhodo: damn\r\nKhodo: didnt expect that.\r\nKhodo: well\r\nKhodo: good gamer regardless\r\nKhodo: game*\r\n(Game 1 is my utter joy and me acting like a fool. This chat logs reminds me of myself blasting loud dubstep play Twitch Jungle and having a blast messaging around. I understand that people don't take what I say as jokes but i sincerely meant every word as a joke and to goof off)\r\n\r\nGame 2\r\nIn-Game\r\nKhodo: EWAT\r\nKhodo: fiddle u fucking whore\r\nKhodo: get bot lane\r\n(fiddle left bot lane for no reason and he didn't come back for a long time, I was upset and I handled it wrong)\r\nKhodo: you ahve been in lane since min 6\r\nKhodo: lee has done more supoiorting than ur dumbass\r\nKhodo: ur troliing\r\nKhodo: 10/10 fiddle is worse than trynd\r\n(trynd was my inting friend)\r\nKhodo: ur garbage\r\nKhodo: maybe if i had a support i mightve been able to snoball\r\nKhodo: but he just started jerking it everywhere\r\nKhodo: one?\r\nKhodo: zero\r\nKhodo: support\r\nKhodo: please\r\nKhodo: ive been bitching about you not being my support\r\nKhodo: you left my lane at 6\r\nKhodo: and never came back\r\nKhodo: trash can\r\nKhodo: shhhhhhhh\r\nKhodo: ?\r\nKhodo: lee\r\nKhodo: you like in the womb\r\n(Game 2 I was duo que’d with 2 other of my friends and both of them were trolling and I’ll admit I was honestly upset not just at fiddle but also at them in the discord call, I was playing Twitch ADC)\r\n\r\n\r\nGame 3\r\nIn-Game\r\nKhodo: uh\r\nKhodo: my game fucked\r\nKhodo: theres typing all over it\r\nKhodo: telling me about items\r\nKhodo: WHAT\r\nKhodo: okay fixed it\r\nKhodo: xd\r\nKhodo: i want that blue\r\nKhodo: HAHAHAHA\r\nKhodo: dont follow me lulu\r\nKhodo: ive got autistim\r\n(insestive joke, I understand, but I was hyped in the moment and i didnt soemthing very dumb that got my support lulu killed but not me)\r\nKhodo: and invisablity\r\nKhodo: i mean tbh\r\nKhodo: ur an indpened man and you can do what you please\r\nKhodo: okay\r\nKhodo: LULU ITS OUR TIME\r\nKhodo: COME COME\r\nKhodo: ez\r\nKhodo: stop.\r\nKhodo: big brain ezreal\r\nKhodo: either comit to being alittle bitch and run away or come with us\r\nKhodo: good\r\nKhodo: OH NO\r\nKhodo: RITORITO\r\nKhodo: wow\r\nKhodo: i shoulda left\r\nKhodo: IM ABOUT TO GO SUPER SAIYAN\r\nKhodo: RYZE\r\nKhodo: AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH\r\nKhodo: AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH\r\nKhodo: MF\r\nKhodo: wanna talk about it?\r\nKhodo: pls\r\nKhodo: dont ff\r\nKhodo: i want a full match\r\nKhodo: i need to hit my power spike\r\nKhodo: come\r\nKhodo: YEAH\r\nKhodo: SUCK THESE\r\nKhodo: ur too 2 good for this team lulu\r\nKhodo: wanna try that\r\nKhodo: AHHHHHH\r\nKhodo: anoteh easy game\r\n(game 3 I made friends with the lulu -she was a really good support- and I had a lot of fun with the entire team that game, I was playing Twitch ADC)\r\n\r\n\r\nThose are the 3 Game’s that I have been reported for and I understand that I broke the code but I want to explain my love for this game to finish this off. This game has been my daily life for a while now. It’s been there for me when I need to take my mind off something, its provided me with countless memories with good friends, and most importantly It’s been a good game to return to each day. I play this game ruthlessly, grinding everyday for nothing at all. I don’t excel in ranked nor am I mechanically gifted by any means at all but I’ve poured sweat and tears into this game. I cried for hours after my ban begging support staff and pleading with any amount of money or effort to get it back. I would do ANYTHING to get it back, I’m not rich but I’ve got a small saving of 2K that I’d drop in a heartbeat for it back. when i say anything I mean anything, League community service, you name it, I’ll personally fly down to Riot Games headquarters and apologize in person if that's what it would take. Even if the ban was only issued for half a year instead of permanent or a permanent mute and ranked ban (because you need communication for ranked).\r\n\r\nAnyway, I’m getting too soppy to continue writing. I know this a marathon of reading but this means more to me than anyone would ever know. Any help or wisdom on this matter is greatly appreciated and a whole heartily thank you for reviewing my case and I wish you a merry christmas. &lt;3\r\n\r\nPS: questions are welcome and I’ll answer as soon as possible","replies":[{"poster":"Eedat","date":"2019-12-24T07:51:07.204+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"My man those are some wild logs.

You never mentioned going and reading them, figuring out the nuances, and how you know them so well now that you can prevent yourself from breaking them again. Riot doesn't care about your personal life. They care about your ability to follow the rules, which you never mention once, and the money you spend. You will never have your account back, because thats just how permanancy works, not because you dont seem remorseful. So stop with the \"ohhh i changed so much im such a better person\" bullshit, and learn to follow the rules. The rules have nothing to do with how you are as a person.
