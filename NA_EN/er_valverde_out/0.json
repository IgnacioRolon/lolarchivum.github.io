Even before I start recording using OBS, first I need to achieve stable 60fps in Lolreplay, then I want to even start recording. Also I have 100+ while playing a regular match. Where could be a problem, if somebody knew, please let me know, I would be thankful to heaven.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-04-01T20:23:38.971+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Watching a replay still requires the use of assets in-game, so you could just be going through some general frame rate problems.  As a first step, I'd suggest going over the steps in the [FPS issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting) guide to tune things up by updating drivers, fixing any bad files, etc.  Hopefully that does the trick!","replies":[]}]}
