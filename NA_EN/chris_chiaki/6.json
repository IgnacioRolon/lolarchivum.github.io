Second, go look at Yasuo's stats. Go do it and then compare them to those mages you just mentioned. You'll find that their defenses are very comparable. Yes, Yasuo has a refreshing shield, mobility, and the wind wall. All of that is true. But you know what Yasuo also has that those mages don't? Risk inherent to his playstyle.\n\nThey can an all attack from far beyond melee range. They can siege towers and provide zone control. Yasuo has mobility, damage, and the need to get really up close and personal to do most of that damage. Range is tremendously powerful, perhaps more so than any other mechanic in League of Legends. That is why melee champions do more damage, have shields, sustain, and so on. Because being melee puts them at an inherent disadvantage.\n\nAnd as for the life steal? Please. Warlord's procs once every two seconds, which is every 3-4 AAs if he's not hitting and running. The same applies to marksmen, which as I said, have the safety provided by attack range, as well as their front line to protect them in a fight. They're also squishy as hell and build sustain to mitgate their low defensive stats.\n\nThat's the thing, man. Yasuo has ADC stats to do a melee job, so you better believe he'll have a strong kit to get it done.","replies":[{"poster":"TheChaoticSwede","date":"2015-11-26T13:25:54.411+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"And then you build IE with Shiv and just build straight tank and laugh as your lane opponent can no longer damage you while you delete their health in 2-4 hits.\n\nHave you tried playing as TF against a Yasuo? Veigar? Syndra? Ahri? Fuck even Brand? You can win lane for the first 10 minutes if the Yasuo just blatantly ignores your poke but as soon as he get IE and boots you might as well just roam bot or top and never go back into lane otherwise you're going to die and there's nothing you'll be able to do about it unless you literally have your jungler come and act as a mid lane support.\n\nYou winning lane, of course, is assuming that the enemy jungler won't just camp you to make sure their Yasuo gets ahead anyway...which they probably will.\n\nYour argument is may work when it comes to champions who HAVE to build MOSTLY damage and squishy items...NOT when that said champion can build two required items and then build whatever the fuck else he wants and still do more damage than most champions in the game.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Zedex","date":"2015-11-26T22:58:12.764+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Apples to oranges buddy.
