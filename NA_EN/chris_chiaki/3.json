So cc works for them.\n\nThe real answer is positioning. Katarina should be able to 1 shot your carries late game. She's an assassin after all. The issue is she has no escape like all other assassins: talon, zed, leblanc, fizz, even akali has unreliable invisibility and multiple jumps. So katarina can't ever half commit like other assassins, she can only enter the fight if she's guaranteed a kill. If you don't give her that opening to guarantee a kill, the fight is essentially a 4v5. \n\nYour carries should also have shields, heals, banshees, zhonyas, flash, Guardian Angels, and other defensive options against katarina to prevent her dive from resulting in a kill and a reset. And this pretty much kills her because she's now behind enemy lines, didn't get the reset, likely had to flash to even get in range of your carries (and if she didn't that's even worse positioning on their part considering how close they'd have to be), and she's now being locked down with cc with no escapes left. And if you're carry can't react within 0.7 seconds, they probably shouldn't be playing league, because that's a pretty long window for reaction time.","replies":[{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2015-06-10T14:19:47.349+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":5,"body":"Sorry but no.\n\nKatarina doesn't have an escape?

What?\n\n\"katarina can't ever half commit like other assassins, she can only enter the fight if she's guaranteed a kill.\" \n\nI literally said she has no escape provided a kill doesn't happen. This isn't saying a kill isn't likely to happen, it's saying that she is unable to commit before a guaranteed kill because, unlike most other assassins, she can't disengage from within the middle of a team unless she first gets a kill.\n\n\n>You katarina humpers act like Katarina doesn't have a team that is backing her up. Sure, if she just jumps in, cc her, no problem. But thats not how this game works.

The difference might be the kills being more spread out as opposed to a penta kill, but that's hardly relevant apart from a dick measuring contest. It's honestly better to have the kills spread out so the there's a distribution of power that's harder to shut down, as opposed to putting all your eggs in one basket so to speak. Those 5 kills are gonna happen in the scenario you mentioned, the only reason you'd complain is because pentakills are flashy and you can claim a single champion as your scapegoat while you're forced to admit you played poorly when the kills are more evenly distributed. \n\n> Oh and also, 0.7 seconds? If your a carry with less than 2 defensive items, Katarina doesn't even give you that buddy, if you knew what you were talking about, you would know that.\n\nI've played over 2000 games on katarina over the past 5 and a half years and had an 82% win rate with her last season in diamond. \n\nYou're silver 2 with less than 500 wins in total. I'm not trying to be a dick, but you're the one starting with the aggression and insults. I can reasonably state I believe I'm more experienced and knowledgeable on the subject than you are. \n\nNo unfed katarina will kill your carry fast enough for them to not be able to react, regardless of the specific time which obviously varies significantly game to game, player to player, and champion to champion. \n\n\n> Even if she doesn't get the reset, if she zhonya's, provided she has at least 10% cdr, she will be able to shunpo again to safety.\n\nlol what?  \n\n- Katarina doesn't build any cdr items. That's a fact and if she did she'd be sacrificing much needed damage. No high level build is going to contain any cdr items. \n\n- She might gets a small %cdr from masteries, but there's no scenario where she should be taking cdr runes over the aternatives. \n\n- Katarina doesn't max shunpo first or even second, so even if the rest of these fallacious conditions were true, they would only hold true at level 18\n\nBut lets assume all that is false anyway and you have shunpo maxed and 10% cdr somehow.\n\nShunpo max cd is 6 seconds, so that means it takes 5.4 seconds to come off cd after use. Zhonyas lasts 2 seconds. that's a **3.4** second window to cc and kill katarina. If you're team can't kill a glass cannon assassin in that time, it's your own fault. Especially when her entire kit is extremely predictable. She throws Q and jumps in, you can see the preparation during her Q animation time, so you have plenty of time to prepare for the engage. \n\n\n\nYour game knowledge on at least this subject seems very poor and you sound bigoted towards a champion you find frustrating because you refuse to acknowledge their weaknesses and change your own playstyle to exploit them.\n\n\nEDIT: \n>She is by design, broken. She is an assassin who is ment to kill not one target, not two, but five. In under 5 seconds. \n\nI don't see a probably with this when the more common path is she gets no kills and is shut down. She doesn't act like most assassins where they can usually guarantee a kill and might die with it or get a few more if they're lucky.\n\nShe can't guarantee that first kill because she has major base damage and scaling caps. But if she does get that first kill, her damage potential unlocks and she exceeds all other assassins. The point is, that first kill is harder to get and more dangerous to try to get than on any other assassin. This is where she's balanced, and this is why she's seen less in high level play where players don't make nearly as many mistakes and know how to position properly.

If they're already ahead, yes it's an issue because she can be a threat even when shutdown. But if her team isn't significantly ahead already and can't stand on their own, she won't be as effective, even if she herself is ahead. \n> \n> That's why I generally try to give away as many kills as possible on katarina. I don't need kills, my team does. That way the power is distributed and harder to shutdown, which is a reasonable strategy for any assassin, not just katarina.\n\nNice point.  Everyone looks at the thing that killed them, not the 10 decisions they made that led them to getting killed.","replies":[{"poster":"bonfire10","date":"2015-06-10T15:11:50.421+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks, I agree that the approach for shutting down katarina in teamfights might be counter-intuitive.

You either safely get vision or back off. \n\n> jinx hit you with her global ult .. why was you close enough for her to hit you\n\nThis is a bit of a different issue because skillshots are dodgeable. Unless you had no vision of it coming or had your movement impaired, it shouldn't hit either. Skillshots are less a matter of closeness and more a matter of cc, missile speed, and predictability. \n\n> someone flashes dashes and mauls you ... why didn't you just randomly teleport to your fountain to get out of his range ? \n\nThe solution would be to not be in range of their flash dash. That might seem unreasonable, but it's honestly what you have to do. If I'm playing with a lower level friend and he's playing a squishy character and steps close enough for a talon to Flash + E him, I yell at him to move back because he's way overextended. \n\nI feel like there's almost an arrogance of carries to think they should be safe wherever they go as long as they aren't within attack range of an assassin. The point of being a carry is you need constant protection and peel, and even that might not be enough if you don't react defensively fast enough. \n\n\nAdcs aren't likely to kill you within a second of entering their space; assassins are. It's what they're designed to do. But staying out of that space means that champion is contributing no damage. This is why that line of thinking is effective against assassins. They are the ones that need to make the first move in order to be useful. They have to be proactive in dealing damage where you can control them reactively by not giving them that opportunity.\n\nI would summarize my point as this:\n\nKilling the assassin is no where near as important as not letting the assassin kill you. Removing the assassin from the game doesn't help your team as much as him removing you from the game helps his team. So just focus on not dieing and you'll shutdown the assassin more consistently than you would if you were actively trying to kill him.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2015-06-10T14:29:33.413+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Leblanc does not assassinate entire teams","replies":[{"poster":"bonfire10","date":"2015-06-10T14:31:44.893+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Neither does katarina when the enemy team doesn't give her the opportunity.
