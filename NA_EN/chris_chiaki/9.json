Its about taking full advantage of the advantage gained from when you do successfully pull it off and possibly kill Zed.

But, you dont generally get a blue in solo Q, and then you are at an extreme disadvantage vs zed with maybe a doran's ring for mana sustain.\n\nI think more people watch LCS than play the game, and just talk out of their ass about balance issues. Hell, even in LCS Zed has like a 80% win-rate, and they get the 2nd blues every single time to pretty much make rushing armguard the smartest thing to do.

That doesn't mean rushing it is a helpful thing to do. And zhonya's doenst keep zed from killing you. It just keeps death mark from gibbing you.

My point is rushing a seekers puts you at a disadvantage in lane, unless you are getting blue buffs ala LCS, and we all know you aren't getting any early blue buffs in ranked.\n\nAnd it doesnt counter zed. Why the hell do you people keep thinking seeker's counters zed? It just makes him deal a little less damage to you; that pissy amount of armor doesn't counter anything; it just lets you not get poked out and all-in'd as fast. Every zed gets an early brutalizer anyways. Seekers is still a damned if you do, damned if you dont item. You dont counter anything he does with a seekers. You slightly mitigate it, at the cost of being able to clear waves/fight back, which has its own set of problems.\n\nNo one is arguing that zhonyas isnt a required item vs zed, or a great item for any mage. Having to rush it when facing a basically resourceless champion like zed, on what are typically mana-gated champs, basically sucks.

I'll admit that. But why not get Zhonya's second? A Deathcap is an even more valuable purchase when you already have a few AP items, so its ok not to get it second. Void Staff in general is not needed early (sometimes on certain champs you might want to pick it up early, but just in general) and can be bought later, particularly against a Zed, which as many in this thread are saying, doesn't buy a great deal of MR usually. \n\nMy main point is (and I think what OP's main point is too) that if you are having trouble vs. a Zed, or think you will have trouble, there are ways to strategize against him. Seeker's and Zhonya's are one of those ways. If I were Brand and I was doing poorly against that Zed, I'd probably want a Seeker's early just so I hopefully wouldn't feed Zed to beyond the point of my team being able to pick up my slack. Its a better strategy than doing nothing and going back to \"business as usual\" build. More AP is not going to stop me(in any way even slow me) from handing Zed kills. If that Brand is not confident and getting frustrated, he should get a Seeker's or at least the Needlessly Large Rod that will eventually become Zhonya's.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Saianna","date":"2015-03-09T15:58:37.168+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":8,"body":"It's sad that everyone has to build to survive vs Zed, while Zed can proceed with his casual face melting build.\n\nNot exactly fair.\n\nAnd then you have for example Rammus.

Theoretically, he is a perfect assassin. Lots of mobility and excellent burst, but counter able by many things. In practice... Well, when you have champions who use a meaningful resource for their spells and those who do not in a same lane, it turns out about how'd you expect. So this guy can not only assassinate you, but also outpush, outpoke, outfarm and outsustain you.

I dont ban Zed in rank though since my ranked elo is so low that 90% of the zed players suck. Really depends on elo i guess. i mean he is annoying to lane against him but i do okay with annie if i rush zhonyas the armor plus her E works well against him however, i dont feel like he should be able to farm as easily and as safely as he does now.
