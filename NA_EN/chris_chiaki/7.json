It's complete garbage.","replies":[{"poster":"Battlecast Sona","date":"2015-11-21T21:06:27.063+0000","up_votes":21,"down_votes":1,"body":"I can tell you what his problem is - it's that his weaknesses are few and far between.\n\nPeople are stuck in a loop with Yasuo (and I talk about this in other threads) because while Yasuo's kit is overloaded (and \"broken\"), he's not really overpowered (in a traditional sense). He's a character that, theoretically, can be dealt with, but even if you deal with him he's eventually capable of scaling back into being a threat (and really quite quickly).\n\nThe root of the problem can be found in Yasuo's double passive. He doubles his crit AND he gets a shield for moving around. The shield is fine - thematically it makes sense and fits on the character very nicely, and it allows him to lane against some matchups that can be very difficult for him in the level 1-2 range. His crit passive needs to be on an ability (and scale with ranks in said ability) OR it needs to scale with level though, because his capability to have 100% crit at like 15 minutes if he snowballs is just unreal. There's no reason that a character who has access to 100% crit with shiv + crit cloak (less than 4k gold investment) should be able to do it at level 5 if they get ahead. It's why the community complaints are so useless - most people just say \"oh his laning is good\" (it's not really that great against a lot of people due to his shield and tankiness nerfs) or that his windwall counters them or whatever, but that's not really the point - the point is that laning against Yasuo can feel oppressive and then his teamfights continue to feel oppressive right off the bat with little item investment. He's a character with the capacity to bully a lot of popular mage matchups (especially with smart farming and pushing strategies depending on the matchup) who also spikes incredibly early and VERY hard due to doubling all crit chance. Is he beatable in lane? Definitely. Lots of character even have super favorable matchups with him ({{champion:55}} {{champion:91}} come to mind as two assassins that can pretty easily outplay Yasuo at most stages of the game) but to those who enjoy playing mages like {{champion:99}} {{champion:103}} or {{champion:134}} it can be super cancerous because there's not much you can do aside from not play into those matchups (which, in blind pick, is impossible to determine).\n\nThere are some very easy tweaks that would leave Yasuo's mid and late game spikes the same, wouldn't significantly harm his laning, but would make that 100% crit less accessible to him early on in the game, and I think they need to happen. That's the one part of Yasuo's kit I feel can be oppressive no matter what - because of the miniscule gold investment after Shiv to get 100% crit (I mean, it's 800 gold for a crit cloak and then you have 100%), he has access to this huge spike in damage really early on. Would it really be so unreasonable to gate the crits until level 11? Or give his crits an Ashe like mechanic where, with just those two crit items, his crits wouldn't do insane damage? I don't know what the fix is, exactly, but having his crit work the way it does now makes it incredibly frustrating to play against, because even if you're beating Yasuo a lot of times once he achieves 100% crit he can still easily kill you.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Limitanei","date":"2015-11-21T18:30:24.809+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Hextech Gunbard,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=IUqeBK9x,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2015-11-21T13:09:58.331+0000)\n>\n> wow, counterpicks exist, color me tickled.\n> \n> {{champion:90}} {{champion:82}} {{champion:50}} will laugh in his face and then eat him\n\nEvery {{champion:157}} main and their mother has called me a \"scrublord\" for playing Malz against their \"beautiful {{champion:157}} \".\n\nA little part of my soul dies every time.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ahri Body Pillow","date":"2015-11-21T19:06:36.330+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Hextech Gunbard,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=IUqeBK9x,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2015-11-21T13:09:58.331+0000)\n>\n> wow, counterpicks exist, color me tickled.\n> \n> {{champion:90}} {{champion:82}} {{champion:50}} will laugh in his face and then eat him\n\nCounterpicking=/=Counterplay","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rikari","date":"2015-11-21T16:49:55.475+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"because they will always pick yasuo first.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"disregardable","date":"2015-11-21T12:23:55.409+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":41,"body":"You actually can QSS his ultimate, as it is a suppression.
