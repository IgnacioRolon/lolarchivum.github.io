Things like duo jungle or three champs in one lane may happen from time to time, but we're not going to go out of our way to support them. For the most part, the way players allocate number of champs per lane works, and we don't feel the need to monkey with it.\n\nSecond, we are trying to keep the concept of position (top, middle, bottom, jungle) separate from role (fighter, mage, assassin, tank, etc.). We care a lot less which roles are played in which positions _as long as the game is healthy overall_ (more on this below). The characteristics of some roles is going to make them better at some positions (e.g. most junglers are melee) and we're okay with that. Likewise, there are some individual champs that we don't want to see frequently in particular positions, because the results tends to be less fun for everyone. The word \"Support\" is particularly confusing here, because it refers both to a role (\"utility mages\" like Janna and Sona) as well as the (traditionally bottom) position of jumping into a lane with another champ without actively farming minions. A support role like Sona can play the support position, but so can a mage or a tank.\n\nThird, every role (and ultimately every champion, though we're not there yet) has to exist in the game somewhere. This is the big corollary to my second point. If there are mages in the top lane and mages in the mid lane, that's fine. If that means fighters have nowhere to exist, that's not fine. Ideally (and I mean in the sense of a compass direction, not the state of the game today) you'd sometimes see mages and sometimes see fighters top. To use the current topic, jungle tanks didn't feel viable, so we made some changes, and now they are plenty viable and I realize some of you feel they are too viable. In crazy world, maybe there is somewhere for marksmen to live besides bottom and maybe you don't even need a marskman every game. But let's not get too crazy yet. We used to design new champs as \"Gnar is going to be a top lane fighter.\" Now we would say \"Gnar is a fighter\" and leave it up to experimentation and evolution to determine where he fits best, so long as (1) he has some position in which he can be played and (2) isn't oppressive when he does.\n\nFourth, we are trying as a team to be a little more hands off and provide players more room to experiment, and this applies to the state of the meta as well. Now, I'll admit it's difficult sometimes for us to make the determination of when it is time to step in. This year, we wanted to give y'all a chance to adapt to the preseason changes, but our opinion now is that we waited a little too long to react. We are pretty happy overall with the state of the game post patch 5.5 and 5.6, but maybe things would have felt even better if we had made those changes in 5.4, while 5.2 likely still would have been too soon. Make sense? Likewise, we know there is some concern that tanks are too dominant right now, but we want to wait a few patches to see if that's a persistent problem or not. The meta will shift on its own, and has, even without Riot involvement. Sometimes it needs a nudge and sometimes the shift is towards something that is likely unhealthy in the long run, and when that happens it's our responsibility to take action.","replies":[{"poster":"Khell DarkWolf","date":"2015-04-23T02:33:50.785+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Thank you GC,\n\nI like the embracing and free approach to experiment a little with our champion pools to figure what best suits the team or how to get a champion working better per portioned to their role.\n\nBut I kinda feel though as time is progressing on, older champions are becoming harder to experiment with only because if they are one-trick ponies and have to itemize one way then there leaves little to no roof for error in making a diversion in other ways to play them.\n\nI'll give an example (actually two but lets do the first one), Garen:\n\nGaren has a kit that is known to be one trick pony, he can deal damage at the beginning of the game but then falls off as the game progresses which then he has to build tanky to be able to keep pace with his ability to even try to deal damage.\n\nItemization for him calls for:\n\n- CDR\n- Attack Damage\n- Resists in the form of Armor and MR\n- High amounts of Health\n- Crit chance if he wants to make more use of his E\n\nCurrently there are many different options for singular stat itemizations like only Health in the form of warmogs, only pure armor in the form of Thornmail, Pure AD which comes in different flavors too. But combination stats in items are in more shorter supply because of how the items have been changes and removed (looking at Atma's Impaler mind you) in which someone like Garen would want just aren't there.\n\nignoring the Atma's passive and pretending it didn't exist in the first place, It was an actually good item for him because it gave him two things he wanted and are unique combination of stats you can't get anywhere else into a single item slot: Armor and Crit chance.\n\nIf you look at the current field of items now, the only items you can get crit are Youmouu's, Phantom dancer, Static Shiv and Infinity Edge.\nSure he may grab Youmouu's, but it isn't very much in terms of grabbing crit. Infinity edge? Good raw amount of Damage, and good starting amount of crit. But what do I pair it up with?\n\nGaren has no business needing Attack speed just to get that extra crit from PD or Static shiv, Grabbing two infinity edge's sounds wasteful.\n\nSame goes for the CDR department, there is a little more choice in CDR if you want CDR + MR, AD + CDR, but CDR + Armor?\n\nYour choices here are either Frozen Heart, Iceborne gauntlet or Ohmwrecker. The first two all require mana and AP items to be bought which are wasteful on a resourceless champion, especially to the point of the fact if the champion has absolutely no AP ratios to squeeze something more out of it.\n\nSo leaving it now to Ohmwrecker, this is item is just weak in terms of Raw stats. Never mind the fact if you can even make full use of the passive.\nIf you want to get some Armor and CDR let alone HP as combination stats, there really aren't any good choices.\n\nonto the next issue, common spell rotation is to Close the gap on a target he wants to engage with by either walking up or burning Q for the movement speed boost, then using E to spin to win, using W to reduce damage as needed and then use R to try and execute if enough damage is done.\n\nThe problem here like many one trick ponies that struggle is the fact:\n\n- Once you blow your rotation, you have nothing to do in between that wait time to make yourself more beneficial. As in, you did your first protocol that is part of your role, you don't have the secondary action to act on after that\n\nA good Example could probably be Shyvana and Warwick:\n\nFor Shyvana's First Rotation:\n\n- W into a target\n- Autoattack while using E\n- Use Q into Autoattack\n\nSecond Rotation:\n\n- Either use or hold onto Dragon Ult until Cooldowns come back\n- Continue to Autoattack as it benefits the usage of getting more Q's\n\nRinse repeat\n\nWarwick's 1st round:\n\n- Ult a target\n\nWarwick's 2nd action rotation:\n\n- Autoattack with W on\n- Turn E on\n- Use Q to deal damage and try to drain tank in the middle of a fight while staying on a target and run them down\n\nRinse repeat\n\nGaren has this issue, and I honestly think Renekton kinda does as well.\n\nOnce cooldowns are blown, you don't get that much impact while waiting and on what you're able to continue contributing during that period.\n\nIf Garen had something stupid as a passive somewhere in his kit that allowed his basic autoattacks to remove cooldown off his Q like shyvana/skarner then maybe.\n\nIf Renekton had a passive that basic autoattacks lowered the cdr on W's Ruthless Predator like shyvana/skarner, then maybe.\n\nI'm just saying, kits locked in to play a certain way leave little to no imagination of new experimentation on new ways to play a champion. \n\nEspecially if champions want combination stats in items that they have no access to get (atma's impaler's armor + crit or Armor + CDR) since those types of items don't exist or don't have mana or AP Ratio's (Frozen heart / AP Items for Garen/Renekton) to make real use or creative use of them (Deathfire Grasp Garen anyone?

I doubt they will be the \"default\" though.","replies":[{"poster":"CrazedPorcupine","date":"2015-04-23T06:01:46.705+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Azir bot also fills that role of hyper scaling Tower destroyer.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ghostcrawler","date":"2015-04-24T01:12:09.486+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"> Actually, ADC is NOT mandatory in current meta.

I do agree however that a lot of these rules don't apply to pros who have enough skill and team coordination to make very non-traditional comps or strategies work.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"IMMASCOOPYOU","date":"2015-04-19T04:19:44.736+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"You have to understand though, most complaining adcs are bronze and most peeps in bronze don't understand the art of peeling and protecting the carry.

(By worst I mean, the role that one no-one wanted. The role that people actively avoided. People would straight up dodge in champ select if they got forced to play support)\n\nThis was because they were basically fodder for the assassin/bruisers (when the assassin/bruiser meta was a thing). In most games,I usually saw the Soraka/Sona basically existing only to get jumped on by Darius/Zed in the jungle and die. They couldn't fight back. They couldn't stop it. They existed to die to these champions no matter what.\n\nAs I played on and gained summoner levels, it turns out that ADCs were basically in the same boat as supports. They were squishy and just as defenceless as the support. They too died to the Darius who was both tankier and dealt more damage than the ADC. Who gives a crap about the ADC's 3 big DPS items, if every assassin in the game deals more damage faster than they can.\n\nBut the difference between the two roles was that the ADC was actively seeked out and killed. The support was more of a secondary target to go after when the ADC was around. During a teamfight, if the ADC showed up, the Akali would drop everything, instagib the adc and then continue fighting.\n\nBack then, ADC and Support were the least called lanes from what I saw. It was always someone calling mid first in champ select. Then someone calling top after. Then jungle. The last two were usually played by the people who said fill or those who didn't say anything at all (and therefore defaulted to filling a role).\n\nRiot's been aware of this too. Look at how many times they've nerfed assassins. Assassin nerfs were in every patch when I was new in season 3. It was usually Kha'zix from what I remember, but the fact that it's been assassins so many times and NOT adcs is a testament to how weak the ADC role is.","replies":[{"poster":"BluePolarizer","date":"2015-04-19T05:52:06.744+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"then you realize that with good mechanics, ADCs can wreck entire teams (including the enemy ADC if you are playing a longer ranged carry or highly mobile ADC).
