Generally, it's not a good idea to *Alt+Tab* until after you see the champion portraits show up on the loading screen. Doing so before that can prevent League from interacting properly with your Graphics Card and Driver. \n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[{"poster":"thxmxsx","date":"2016-08-25T22:23:13.108+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok its fixed but my game starts up very slower now.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-28T16:18:14.456+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Starts up as in 'after clicking the League Icon' or 'after champ select'?","replies":[{"poster":"thxmxsx","date":"2016-09-11T00:04:45.377+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"After champ select","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-11T16:42:41.607+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Gotcha. Frequently, slow load times are caused by missing system permissions for League, which cause certain requests for data to take longer than they should.
