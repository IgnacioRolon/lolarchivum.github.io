Feel free to disagree down below.\n\n---\n\n#Why is the current Stormrazor a problem?\n\nThe current Stormrazor is a problem because it does nothing to promote what a Marksman is supposed to do: Sustained DPS.\n\nStormrazor gives you a free crit on engage, which leans more towards upfront burst damage than it does DPS, and then discourages you from attacking for the next few seconds in order to get another free crit.\n\nEssentially, this makes ADCs shittier burst champions and as was to be expected, it quickly became a top tier item on Assassins.\n\nAnother thing, whilst not a major problem with the item, it becomes obsolete the more crit items you build, as the closer you come to 100% crit chance, the less valuable the free crit becomes.\n\nNow, of course the best option would be to just remove the item, I wanted to see if I couldn&#039;t find at least some way to make it enjoyable, whilst also not making it too broken.\n\nIn the next segment, I&#039;ll list my proposed change that&#039;ll keep the &quot;free crits&quot; aspect of the item, but change it to be more DPS oriented rather than burst oriented as well as not make it obsolete come late game.\n\n---\n\n#So what&#039;s the proposed change to the item then?\n\nWhen thinking of a proposed change I looked at the glaring problems I needed to be able to solve with this change:\n\n1. Remove burst oriented nature.\n\n2. Make it relevant in the late game.\n\n3. Remove it&#039;s abusability on some champions like Graves and Jhin.\n\nMy idea for the proposed change came from looking through old items that were once in the game.\n\nOne such item I stumbled upon was Ionic Spark.\n\nhttp://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Ionic_Spark\n\nBasically, what Ionic Spark did was give you a lightning effect on every 4th auto attack, dealing magic damage to up to 4 targets, similar to the Statikk Shiv we currently have.\n\nI also looked at the old version of Infinity Edge, which gave you critical strike damage rather than true damage.\n\nI tried to take both of these things and perhaps see how they could fit into Stormrazor and this is what I came up with.\n\n---\n\n#Stormrazor Idea Number 1.\n\n**(RANGED ONLY)**\n\n**Cost: 2600 gold.**\n\n**Attack Damage: 50.**\n\n**Attack Speed: 25%.**\n\n**Unique Passive - Storm&#039;s Edge: Every fourth auto attack will critically strike for 200% damage. All stacks are lost if you haven't auto attacked something for the last 10 seconds.**\n\n**Unique Passive - Nothing Goes To Waste: Every percentage of Critical Strike Chance that exceeds 100% is converted into Critical Strike Damage that only applies to Storm&#039;s Edge critical strikes. Damage is capped at 250% maximum damage.**\n\nBuilds out of: {{item:1042}} + {{item:1038}} + {{item:1042}} + 700 gold.\n\nTo give an example to the Nothing Goes To Waste passive, say you have 4 items. Stormrazor, Statikk Shiv, Rapid Firecannon and Infinity Edge.\n\nThat&#039;s 120% critical strike chance.\n\nThat means everyone of your normal critical strikes will deal the standard 200% damage, but every fourth critical strike will deal 220% damage.\n\nTo make sure this doesn't get out of hand, the maximum amount of damage you'll be able to deal with one Storm's Edge proc will be 250%, achieved through buying 3 Zeal items and Infinity Edge. I've also removed the bonus movement speed burst from Storm's Edge.\n\n---\n\n#Stormrazor Idea Number 2 (suggested by Alfavhunter).\n\n**(RANGED ONLY)**\n\n**Cost: 2600 gold.**\n\n**Attack Damage: 50.**\n\n**Attack Speed: 25%.**\n\n**Unique Passive - Storm&#039;s Edge: Every fourth auto attack will critically strike for 200% damage. All stacks are lost if you haven't auto attacked something for the last 10 seconds.**\n\n**Unique Passive - Gone With The Wind: Every percentage of Critical Strike Chance that exceeds 100% is converted into Bonus Movement Speed from proccing Storm&#039;s Edge critical strikes (lasts for 2 seconds).**\n\nBuilds out of: {{item:1042}} + {{item:1038}} + {{item:1042}} + 700 gold.\n\nTo give an example to the Gone With The Wind passive, say you have 4 items. Stormrazor, Statikk Shiv, Rapid Firecannon and Infinity Edge.\n\nThat&#039;s 120% critical strike chance.\n\nThat means that for every fourth auto attack (Storm's Edge procs), you'll get a short burst of 20% Movement Speed that lasts for 2 seconds.\n\nBasically means, with the maximum amount of critical strike chance possible (240%), your Storm&#039;s Edge critical strikes will give you 140% movement speed for 2 seconds.\n\n#Stormrazor Idea Number 3 (suggested by Z3Sleeper).\n\n**(RANGED ONLY)**\n\n**Cost: 2600 gold.**\n\n**Attack Damage: 50.**\n\n**Attack Speed: 25%.**\n\n**Unique Passive - Storm&#039;s Edge: Every fourth auto attack will critically strike for 200% damage. All stacks are lost if you haven't auto attacked something for the last 10 seconds.**\n\n**Unique Passive - Spray and Pray: Every percentage of Critical Strike Chance that exceeds 100% is converted into Bonus Attack Speed from proccing Storm&#039;s Edge critical strikes (lasts for 2 seconds).**\n\nTo give an example to the Spray and Pray passive, say you have 4 items. Stormrazor, Statikk Shiv, Rapid Firecannon and Infinity Edge.\n\nThat&#039;s 120% critical strike chance.\n\nThat means that for every fourth auto attack (Storm's Edge procs), you'll get a short burst of 20% Attack Speed that lasts for 2 seconds.\n\nBasically means, with the maximum amount of critical strike chance possible (240%), your Storm&#039;s Edge critical strikes will give you 140% bonus Attack Speed for 2 seconds.\n\n---\n\nI hope the post was well structured enough and comprehensible to read.\n\nLike I said above, this is just my own opinion. You&#039;re allowed to share your own thoughts down below.\n\nI&#039;ll even leave a poll so you can easily vote without having to go into detail.\n\nSo yeah, that&#039;s my proposed change to Stormrazor.\n\nThanks for reading.\n\n#EDIT: Added two versions of the item since some people said the critical strike damage passive might be a bit overpowered. Made both versions ranged only to prevent abuse from champions like Tryndamere and Yasuo. I also made stacks run out out of combat based on Avantel Wings' suggestion. Tell me what you guys think of the new version.\n\n#EDIT 2: Added another version of the item based on Z3Sleeper's suggestion.","replies":[{"poster":"chipndip1","date":"2018-10-21T19:00:41.094+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":4,"body":"No\n\nStormrazor isn't supposed to be a scaling item.

Don&#x27;t repeat it.\n\nThis version of Stormrazor isn't as much a scaling item as it's just a \"not completely useless late game\" item.\n\nThe free crit will still be kind of redundant once you have 100% crit chance.\n\nThe 20% crit chance you end up having in excess from buying 2 Zeal items and Infinity Edge has always bothered me since it's implementation and I wanted to see if it could be shifted somewhere else without being completely broken.\n\nAnd don't worry, it won't be nearly as broken as old IE. Old IE gave 50% more damage that applied to *every* critical strike. This one will only apply to every fourth one and it will only deal bonus damage based off of excess critical strike chance.\n\nIf a normal ADC's build would be {{item:3095}} {{item:3087}} {{item:3094}} {{item:3031}} {{item:3080}} {{item:3006}} the fourth critical strike will only deal 20% more damage, not the 50% more damage of old IE.\n\nIf you choose to itemize for more critical strike damage through building 3 Zeal items, you're otherwise giving up sustain/defensive items.\n\nIt becomes a careful balance between \"Do I want more damage or do I want to stay alive for longer?\"","replies":[{"poster":"KnightsKemplar","date":"2018-10-21T20:00:41.297+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"I definitely see your intent, but I'm just not sold on the execution.

It's supposed to give ADCs that little extra oomph in the early to mid game and help them till they reach their late game status... except that it's better on those who don't build crit at all even though it has a passive that \"scales\" with crit yet it just becomes more and more useless the more crit you build. \n\nThe item needs to either stop being a shitty version of duskblade or actually interact with crit in a way that doesn't make it obsolete","replies":[{"poster":"KnightsKemplar","date":"2018-10-21T21:03:44.842+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't want it to have anything that resembles Duskblade.

Yasuo already has reduced efficiency when you scale his passive with new infinity edge since his new two item spike is 120% crit, but this would cancel out that effect and make him a critical strike stacking monster.\n\nYasuo as of right now, unless called for, more or less always gets a starter item straight into a phantom dancer. after he does this, with this new item, he would build this second or third, meaning his 60% crit bonus would be giving him 60% more damage every 4 hits, or in other words, a 15% damage boost overall, not accounting for the already existing crit, which would make his auto attacks even stronger. Then you build an infinity edge and and all the sudden you get 220% damage every fourth auto, and 10% of that is converted into true damage as well, plus his already strong late game with having 100% crit with attack damage and attack speed. then after that, what's going to stop him from getting a statik shiv?

I thought that was clear at first. Current storm razor isn't a scaling item as it doesn't have ratios to magnify your damage or increase the efficiency of your purchases as you go into mid and late game. What it does is it gives you a 100% chance to crit but trades off the actual damage of a true crit. An actual crit attack is supposed to deal 200% damage. That is a systematic value, storm razor makes you deal less. That is why they made it so that if you buy at least a single full crit item, it would give you back the 200%. Otherwise you would spend the rest of the game hitting less than normal crit values and you would of been better off just not buying stormrazor and actually leave things up to the rng crit early on. The 160 to 200 scaling is storm razors CURRENT values, so i did not propose ir ask for anything new.\n\nI also never asked or implied that I want burst back on razor. Please do not put words in my mouth. I said it should be based on 3 autos rather than 4 as you have to consider the time the item is bought and the trading patterns. It's a first buy item, so you get it around the 10 to 13 min mark as your ending your lane phase. 4 autos is an awful lot despite what many people think. 3 is a comfortable spot as it falls in line with most characters passive, making it very clear when the damage is going to kick in. For example vaynes passive is 3 hit. Kaisai, while technically is the only 5 hit adc, plays out a little differently. She gets 2 free ones on the supports engage, then stacks 3 on her own. So she still follows a similar trading pattern. This of course means nothing if you actually meant that the stacks were built on minions rather than combat but I assumed you rather it build in combat since that would void people trying to build it out of combat and jump in for feee burst again.\n\n\"ADCs are not supposed to be hyper mobile in the early to mid game.\n\nThis is a major problem of a little someone known as Jhin, affectionately referred to as \"The Fast\".\n\nI wanted the movement speed to purely be something you use to reposition during late game team fights.\n\n\"\nNo where did i said hyper mobile. Just giving someone move speed doesn't make them hyper mobile. Jhin is the outlier which is why I mention him a few times. He will always be an outlier hut thats beside the point. To clear things up, again, i never asked for more or boosted numbers. People keep thinking thats the way to solve things, but its not. I'm asking for the CURRENT ms that it gives to scale on crit. As in, it has a base of say 10 ms, and to get the full 20, you have to build a full crit item. Still the same .75s duration,and still the same ms in the end. Just less at the start and its tied into a stat that's built by the primary users. This means that if darius builds it for example, he doesn't get a free 20% ms which would be unbelieveably scary. If he wants to make full use of it, he would have to build a crit build, which of course takes away his tankiness. A major trade off for a juggernaut and many divers. But yes, coupling it with crit makes it still be good for mm in repositioning but makes it mostly for MM.\n\n\"I didn't originally make it ranged only, but people here in the comments kept saying it would be broken on Tryndamere and Yasuo.\n\nI had no choice but to comply.\n\n\"\nDon't comply. Stand your ground and make a justification. Most of the community just echoes each others thoughts and it does more harm than good. The game needs people to think above and beyond and get the right feedback to the devs, not just the ones people _feel_ are right.\n\n\"...but crit itself should mostly belong to Marksmen, with the odd Tryndamere here and the Yasuo there.\"\n\nFully agree.\n\n\"Exactly, which is why I added the \"excess crit\" restriction on the movement speed.\"\n\nWhat I clarified earlier addresses this point. The problem with making excess crit, means it applies only to the people that go full 120% crit. There are actually mm that just sit on just below 100 believe it or not. Jhin is someone who is flexible and will always abuse the different stat spreads, which is why its better to just scale up to the current base values and with nominal crit builds (60%). You still get the same affect without alienating or locking a lot of MM into this particular build. Any jugg trying to make use of it still has to go buy storm, + IE and a zeal item . That's already a large trade off that stifles their builds. Yasuo isn't changed much either as his passive already lets him already scale amazingly off crit and ie. He can build storm razor but it's not as valuable as his other items.\n\n\"This version definitely sounds less dangerous than what Stormrazor's current iteration is.\"\n Agreed \n\n\"I do not see how moving it to the 3rd auto helps in anyway.\"\n\nYou actually broke the statement apart here, that's why it sounds unclear. Its saying more or less, this stormrazor change (both the one you proposed and the touches I discussed) can be dangerous for Jhin, _but then again it might not be so bad since its moved to the third auto (or fourth in your case)_ since he doesn't auto fast and does poor sustained damage.\n\nApologies for the terrible quotes.
