Has two definitions depending on the argument:\n\nA. You came up with a really valid argument, but I still want to disagree with you so I&#039;ll use your rank as some form of argument against you.\n\nB. You clearly have a lack of game knowledge and your rank shows it.\n\nFrom my experience, the former occurs much more frequently than the latter.\n\n&quot;I was joking&quot; = I completely meant what I said but I won&#039;t take responsibility for having said something stupid and you&#039;re dumb for not knowing.\n\n\"But he started it first!\" = I was just as big of a problem as he was, but he did his thing chronologically before I did my thing and that justifies my actions.\n\nHowever, I&#039;m pretty sure that there are more that I&#039;ve just never stumbled upon.\n\nSo I&#039;d like to ask you guys what I can add to my list.\n\nCredit will be given, so long as it doesn't count as Naming & Shaming for... Whatever reason.\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nCredit to Kr√≥l Wilk Sam for suggesting \"Overpowered\" and \"Underpowered\".\n\nCredit to ZiLess for suggesting \"But he started it!\" and for suggesting \"You're Bronze\" is situational.\n\nEdit: Stumbled upon a new one myself, \"AFAIK\".","replies":[]}
