I&#039;ve only seen it bought consistently on three Tanks, and that would be Amumu, Ornn and Nautilus. There are just so many better magic resist items for Tanks like Spirit Visage and Adaptive Helm, so Abyssal Mask doesn&#039;t really have a fit niche other than for these three guys.\r\n\r\nSecond off, it&#039;s entire concept as a Tank item is flawed to begin with. As a Tank, you&#039;re not supposed to deal more damage. You&#039;re supposed to soak the enemies&#039; damage. So why would you add a Tank item that makes it so people take more damage?\r\n\r\nThird off, and, this is more of a personal issue, but the fact that it builds out of a Catalyst and it has the Eternity passive, makes building both Abyssal Mask and Rod of Ages very bad and unsatisfying.\r\n\r\nFourth off, with mana now being very abundant on other mage items like Luden&#039;s Echo and Archangel&#039;s Staff, Abyssal Mask doesn&#039;t really need it&#039;s mana component anymore.\r\n\r\nFifth off, we already have two other AP items that are masks but we don&#039;t have an AP item that&#039;s a scepter. Now, this doesn&#039;t affect Gameplay itself, of course, but it adds more thematic to building these items.\r\n\r\nTell me what y&#039;all think.","replies":[{"poster":"MYSTlCFLOW","date":"2018-07-14T19:04:18.755+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah.. i want a revert cause I play fiddle, but uhm. yeah why would tanks build it when all teams have 4-5 ad","replies":[{"poster":"LeftyRaydy","date":"2018-07-16T20:29:21.917+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"-20 MR to surrounding champs that is why.","replies":[{"poster":"MYSTlCFLOW","date":"2018-07-16T22:17:20.824+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=LeftyRaydy,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Lh59AtEU,comment-id=00000001,timestamp=2018-07-16T20:29:21.917+0000)\n>\n> -20 MR to surrounding champs that is why.\n\n-20 mr... to enemy champions.. when ur team has 4-5 ad isn't usefull","replies":[{"poster":"LeftyRaydy","date":"2018-07-16T22:43:27.583+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it was a great item for my Main Ekko especially vs Leblanc, Ahri, Lux, Malz, and so on. I mean it took away a great item for AP mages and assassins while AD assassins and casters still have plenty of choice AKA just build long swords and serrated dirks which turn into anything they need UGH! Meanwhile what is AP's choice they only have 1 as a non support item and thats Banshees veil which by the way sucks (not the passive).","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"remakoro","date":"2018-07-16T16:57:45.525+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tanks?
