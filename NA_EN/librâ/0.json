It was in the loading screen which 2 of us had skins equipped that we didn&#039;t own. (Ice Toboggan Corki/Marauder Olaf). Also at the end of this game, we had won but didn&#039;t get any lp or ip, yet it shows on our match history.\n\nEdit: I forgot to mention this happened after we had traded champions back and forth in champ select.","replies":[{"poster":"Boomer Blitz","date":"2016-01-15T22:08:56.549+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Except in my case, the person I was trading with didn't even own the skin I ended up having (Rusty Blitzcrank)","replies":[]},{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-01-15T19:41:54.407+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey DeputyDonger36,\n\nThank you for the report!
