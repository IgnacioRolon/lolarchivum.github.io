It just started out of nowhere about 3-4 days ago I've been logging on each day testing ping in Custom games, there was a thread awhile back about the same issue I always played with 74 ping but now it's 100-200+. I don't get any reconnects in game, I do lose a bit of frames every so often but I don't see how this can just suddenly happen? People keep telling me to get better internet but I was able to play League flawlessly before then, I'm able to play games on consoles just fine so I don't think my internet is the problem here. I would like some help. It's not really the first time this has happened either, it happened back when the servers were changing around. \n\nI'm in a reserve so getting better internet wouldn't be very possible for me but I am being 100% honest when I say I don't have terrible internet that makes playing online unplayable, I have been able to play games back to back in the past and this change in ping is recent. I hope that this can be fixed or a cause of it to be found. {{item:3070}} \n\n_Sincerely, Me._\n\nI believe I have fixed with with a simple repair of the client.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-14T16:57:42.323+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Irregular latency (ping) is often the result of routing issues to a specific server.

Thank you so much for the reply, I thought repairing the client had fixed the problem because when I had hopped into a game I was sitting at 73Ping for a bit but then it went back to 100+ ping lower than before I gotta say. I'm also on Windows 10 if that helps with anything, I've seen some people say that Windows 10 is the cause of it but I'm not entirely sure I'm not all that much of a whiz.
