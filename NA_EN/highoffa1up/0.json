After setting up my Laptop on the QoS feature I was relieved to have my ping lower than normal and then some, I am currently playing with 73PING and if it were possible to get LoL working on there too it could possibly lower it further. :)","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-29T18:24:59.870+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you set up QoS to give your laptop network bandwidth priority, you wouldn't need to configure QoS for League unless you want it to have priority across all devices on the network. \n\nSince this is specific to that router, you'll want to check google or your router manufacturer's support site to get assistance on setting up QoS. Let me know if you have any other questions.","replies":[{"poster":"HighOffa1UP","date":"2016-09-30T02:27:58.738+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh hello again! I had come to the conclusion that I best not push it, the ping I have from just adding my Laptop onto the feature has been of great help and I wouldn't want to some how screw that up. But I believe there may be a bit of a problem on the servers due to a pick up in ping again today. *September 29th\n\nI hope it's not me again.. {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-02T15:28:20.760+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Changes in latency are most often caused by ISP routing changes. If it's still sitting fairly high, we can run a set of traceroutes using [WinMTR.](http://winmtr.net/) Simply open the app, plug in 104.160.131.1 into the IP host field, then start the trace. After it has run for 5 minutes, export the results as text and paste them here in a reply.\n\nThis will give us context as to where the latency is rising and what nodes it occurs on.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
