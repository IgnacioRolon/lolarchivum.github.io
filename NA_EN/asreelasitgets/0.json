I got no E mail for a password reset. I did this three times. I even went back to US servers to test things out for password reset and got the  E-mail password reset very fast. \n\nSo if I am here in the US and can't log in to the EU West but my friend from Netherlands who can log in to the US all the way where he lives then why in the fucking hell can I not log in to the EU west especially when I just made a new account? I also did not get a e mail asking to verify my account which I thought that was the first thing I would do.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-02T03:24:12.651+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's a pretty small thing that a lot of people miss, but make sure that you're changing the region just below the password box to the region that you're trying to login to. Since you just made a EUW account you'll need to make sure it says Europe West.","replies":[]}]}
