Not gonna lie, I really want them myself now xD!!! I can't say for sure, simply because I don't have any info on upcoming merch items, but you can be the first to know by checking out our merch site and [**news page**](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news) from time to time!","replies":[{"poster":"ReisenTheDos","date":"2017-07-25T04:15:59.036+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why isn't there a forum for just Riot Merch alone? Because I would love to request a Caitlyn figure as a good, cheaper alternative compare to her statue (which I would love to own someday). \n\nRight now, the closes thing to a Caitlyn figure is the mystery Funko pop box. That took me five tries to find her, along with Morgana.","replies":[]}]}]}
