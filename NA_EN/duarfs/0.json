I then solo queue another game directly after. Then while in the game loading screen spiked up to 999, then we got in game and I had 4000 ping. my computer proceeded to black screen and then turn off.  I turned off my WiFi, as soon as I got back into game they voted to remake. they remade still, my vote not counting. The next day I played a different game until my friends were on. we started a ranked game. 16 minutes into the game my block lost power. I then immediately drove to my friends house on my scooter in the rain to continue the game. My friends hate it when I have a leave buster, can you please look at my case and either take away Leave Buster or reset my ranked games.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-12T23:02:38.293+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like your computer is having a hardware issue, and going black because it can't render the game.  I highly recommend going over our [Game Crash ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes)guide to help get that resolved.  Leaverbuster is not something that can be removed manually, as the account needs to show consistent gameplay without interruptions.  Even if the other leave wasn't intentional, it still causes a negative experience for players.  More information on this can be found through our[ Leaverbuster FAQ.  ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ)  \n\nI recommend troubleshooting in custom games to prevent further occurrences.
