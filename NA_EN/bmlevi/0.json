If i check any website it says talon has good winrate against anivia. Yes i know talon is broken but I don&#039;t see how can I dominate this lane as talon. I mean in lane a decent anivia will hold his q until I jump on her as talon and i will lose the trade afterwards. Not to mention if i pull off a good trade somehow then she will just revive. She also perma-pushes the lane after 6 so roaming could be worth if I get a kill but if not I just lost a wave. In early fights on river for scuttle I&#039;m more useful than anivia but if they don&#039;t happen then what can I do? She also outscales talon. So could someone explain what I supposed to do? Sorry for bad english","replies":[{"poster":"Khristophoros","date":"2018-07-15T11:43:59.053+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Look more closely at the stats. She has a 54% lane kill rate against Talon, so Talon does not have the advantage in lane.\n\nA lot of her other counter champions are roamers. Her biggest counters according to winrates are ASol and Quinn. Talon also has the ability to roam across the map quickly.\n\nTo me these stats suggest that the best way to beat her is to efficiently roam to other lanes while being able to get back to lane quickly as well.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LightIsMyPath","date":"2018-07-15T12:48:15.977+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello! I play Anivia pretty often but I 'm just a Goldie, so my impression may be wrong . I rarely get killed by a Talon in lane but I have negative pressure on the wave pre-6 so if he decides to roam early (and he's one of the few champions that can do it effectively) my team is screwed . Be it a gank to bot or top or a contest on my jungler on camps or, worse, at scuttle. I literally can't leave the lane as I always have a wave crushing onto me which takes an eternity to clear and he's free to move. After 6 I can punish his roams but until I have my mana items online I can't stay in lane that long, and he still clears quickier than me when I 'm sitting on a tear + catalyst. If by the time I complete rod of ages and have my tear stacking he didn't grab an advantage elsewhere I consider the game won, but that's a pretty big window of time.","replies":[{"poster":"bmlevi","date":"2018-07-18T11:19:05.438+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks man!

Another thing and I am not sure I have never played Talon, but can he jump over Anivia's wall, because some counter websites will list that as a \"counter\".","replies":[]},{"poster":"YourNumber1Fan","date":"2018-07-15T10:05:10.631+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi im a Talon otp the trick to beating eggy is to bait walk into a bush to pretend to roam then walk up behind her predict the q ult her if you can kill her do it but if you cant back off your just aiming for the passive. \n\nWait for your ult again then set up a freeze and zone her or ask for your jungle to gank a Aniva is a easy lane to gank plus she can never combo you because you just e her wall.\n\nJust don't dive her she will rek you also if you can level 2 cheese her MAKE SURE YOU BACK OFF or she will kill you since you dont have the damage to kill her passive that early let her push and ask for gank tell them passive is down.\nGL {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}} \n\nEdit: never jump on a aniva if she has q she gets extra damage from landing it also her q is slow af so you should rarely get hit by it in lane get boots if you have trouble","replies":[{"poster":"bmlevi","date":"2018-07-15T10:30:46.790+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks man all the tips.
