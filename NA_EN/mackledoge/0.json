At first I was like, great another person spamming trying to offer League classes or their stream. But then I actually looked through the email and it's another third party application. Nothing wrong so far, I'm actually interested to look at it now that Riot has sort of stated a portion of their official policy. So I go to the site to look at it (which I'll include the link below so that others can look at it) and what I see doesn't look like it complies with Riot's policies at all.\r\n\r\nSome features do, like being able to appear offline or having an auto-log feature if you dodge a queue (though that isn't safe btw). Others however seem extremely unfair and against the spirit of the game. For example, the one that caught my eye was the **ability to see the opposing team in ARAM as soon as the champions are rolled and the lobby begins**. I don't know about you, but that seems incredibly unfun and against the point of ARAM. Again, I won't deny that some features the program claims to have aren't great ideas and features I want, but it's a very bad policy to start allowing programs that have a few good features even though they have offending features that don't comply with the third party policy. Tack on that this program is in closed beta and I'd like an official verdict from a Riot employee on this one, or at least an acknowledgement that Riot has seen this program and is evaluating it to determine whether or not it is a legal program.\r\n\r\nDo any of you have thoughts on the program or experience with it? Is it even a legitimate program or is this just another scheme to try to get personal data off of the beta application or request? Either way, the site is quite simply www.lolenhance.com and is also the source of my information on the matter.","replies":[{"poster":"Sargonas","date":"2014-05-14T11:47:13.049+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey all! Your friendly neighborhood 3rd party guy here! \n\nI've seen this app discussed a lot lately, and while I have not yet had time to personally look at it, from the gist of what I've read (and what I too got in my own twitch Inbox), my first impression is that there are some aspects of this app that do indeed violate our \"Nothing should interfere with the game experience from \"Play\" to the end of game results screen.\" policy. That alone should be a red flag for players that this app is likely not something that should be considered ok.\n\nSecondly, there appear to be features of this app that clearly have an impact on the fair and balanced nature of games, which is one of the most important things we want to try to protect. I want to raise awareness that using apps that do either of these open you up to being potentially being on the receiving end of any potential punishments from our support team.\n\nLastly, with apps like this we can never vouch for the security of them and always want to warn players to be careful when trying them out, especially when it involves account security. \n\n**TL;DR, when generally speaking... if an application does *anything* to interject directly with your gaming experience from when you hit the \"Play\" button to the moment you see the match results, it's safe to assume that it's not ok from us. If you always use that rule of thumb it should help give a good sense of guidance on what is and is not ok, rather than have to wait for us to comment on each individual app. (Though I certainly don't mind you all asking about them!)**","replies":[{"poster":"GregreTricky","date":"2014-05-14T14:46:25.758+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"And also, is sponsored by a ELO Boosting website.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MackleDoge","date":"2014-05-14T16:47:32.119+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you very much for the reply and clarification. Glad to see that we are on the same page about this application containing questionable features and even, rather blatantly in my opinion, offending features.\n\nIn case you end up coming back and I can steal more of your time, with the new policy and the work being done on updating everything further and releasing it for finer viewing, is there any communication with actual developers of third party applications like this? Will the makers of LoLEhance receive an email from you guys trying to open up a discussion between you two over this program or do you just rely on the players to make the informed decision and then distribute warnings/punishments if they don't?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"3Osxocqz2C","date":"2014-05-14T15:05:44.865+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm just really intrigued by the 'offline mode' and think that's something Riot should offer in the regular client.","replies":[{"poster":"MackleDoge","date":"2014-05-14T16:44:27.780+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's actually a small glitch with that sort of thing. There is an application for mobile devices that allows you to log onto the chat PVP.net client from your phone. If you log onto that while you are logged into the client, then log out of the mobile device application, it'll make you appear offline in the client on your actual laptop or desktop.\n\nAt least it did a few weeks ago, that was the last time one of my friends used the feature.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"bzhen0915","date":"2014-05-14T14:32:32.206+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey where do I find this so I can cheat?\n\n\nLol jk.
