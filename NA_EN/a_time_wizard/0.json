You tried your best but you just couldn't do it. It happens to everyone once in a while but it still sucks, nobody likes losing. Also your teammates kept asking you to stop feeding, as if you were doing it on purpose to begin with. You were playing bad before, but now you can't help but play even worse because it feels like you're on a 1v9. You feel pressured to take risks and make plays to compensate for your early mistakes, but end up screwing up even more. Eventually you see an opportunity to finally get a kill to help your team and make up for everything, but it goes south and you die instead. The enemy allchats \"?\", and your team is now convinced you're trolling. At the end of the game, as you are looking at 5 people flashing masteries while dancing around your nexus exploding and knowing it was because your best still wasn't enough, somebody on your team says \"report X plz gg\". Somebody on the enemy team says \"gg ez pz thought it was coop\".\n\nYou walk way from the PC, get a glass of water and calm down, comforting yourself now at least that horrible experience was over. But as you sit down again you are greeted with a message from Rito saying \"lol u suck don't play anymore until u git gud (somehow) kthnxbye  oh btw ur banned lmao\"\n\nGood idea.\n\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[{"poster":"A Time Wizard","date":"2016-11-02T02:31:36.621+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im pretty sure that people would report said person for intentionally feeding the enemy team in that case, not for playing badly, but just adding an extra button for playing badly that actually doesnt have an affect (even if it used to) would help seperate games where people were playing badly and games where people were actually intentionally feeding and hopefully stop that person from being banned.
