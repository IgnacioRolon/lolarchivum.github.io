Please try again in a few minutes. If the issue persists, cotact Player Support.'\r\nI then contacted the support through mail, and after like 25 mails has been sent from me to the support and from the support to me, he concluced that i couldnt proof that the account is mine, even tho i offered him everything from passport, driving licens, paypal transactions-ids, ip-addresses.. Everything, but not the what did u first buy on your account kinda questions cause really? I dont remember so many years back.. But as i said, he dinied me acess to the account duo to i in his opinion couldnt proof i am the owner of the account?\r\n\r\ni then stopped playing League of Legends, but i have thought about this from january and its still stressing me..\r\n\r\nI now, 7 months nearly 8 months later try login again, and it still says the same issue about 'Your account is in the process of transferring...'\r\n\r\nAnd now i got enought of this, how hard can it be to make the account transfer complete, so i can login again and play? Dunno if it all startet because i have an account on EUW with the exact samt username as the account on EUNE i am transfering to EUW have?\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\nAnd this account im writing from now, has nothing to do about the transfered account, just had to use another account to login to the boards and write this..","replies":[{"poster":"FroggyGuy","date":"2017-07-29T14:37:06.082+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay, nothings have changed..

I know our account team won't restore access to an account unless they are absolutely sure it's going back to the owner, so they take it very seriously.  Even if you don't pass, it's okay to keep trying!  Just fill out an [account recovery form](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=72416) and they can review your case again, no harm!
