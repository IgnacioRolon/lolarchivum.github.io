DMG to the captive champions inside \r\nand posibbly around it\r\nI say Jarvans ult should be AOE, incase it does miss.. some dmg, will be dealt  if you was near it.\r\nCould possible be main dmg to the targetted champion and part dmg to the champions around\r\nor caught inside.\r\nor an unmissable ult thats like ZED DARIUS..ETC....","replies":[{"poster":"Vioforte","date":"2015-07-01T05:05:21.881+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"My issue is that he is royalty much like Azir.
