{"poster":"Redesignated","date":"2017-06-29T01:10:47.831+0000","title":"Persistent inability to load into game after random disconnect.","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Got into an ARAM to start off League for the night, but apparently the game really doesn't want me to play it, because I got a spontaneous disconnect in the middle of the match, and it's refused to load me back in since, after over 40 minutes of trying. The match is apparently _still_ going according to places like OP.GG, LoLNexus, etc.\r\n\r\nTeams are/were Tahm Kench (me), Vi, Orianna, Sion, and Shaco; versus Jhin, Jax, Brand, Azir, and Fiddlesticks.\r\n\r\nA few minutes before my disconnect, the Vi on my team said that she experienced a strange lag spike, but nobody else claimed to be having difficulties. I had absolutely zero problems up until an arbitrary point during the match, where I was disconnected _solely_ from the game itself, but _not_ the base client with chat et al. My connection to everything else was perfectly fine. I restarted my router anyways, and my computer itself to try to fix the problem. Still happening.\r\n\r\nI've received no Bugsplats or error messages about corrupted files. I'm still able to log into the client, but as soon as it tries to load me into the match itself, it says, yet again, that I've been disconnected. Literally the only thing out of the ordinary is that, when I restart the client completely, it _very_ briefly shows \"Remember Me\" as unchecked and has red text above the username and password fields that says \"We're unable to log you in because you may be offline\" — which is strange, because it appears before I've even tried to log in, and before things like the VS. artwork loads. After a brief moment, the red text disappears, \"Remember Me\" is checked again, and it looks normal.\r\n\r\nAt this point, the Windows sound effect for the pop-up that accompanies that \"disconnected\" message is possibly the most infuriating part of trying to fix this. I've had this happen very rarely in the past, but usually restarting the computer or at least the client resolves the issue.","replies":[{"poster":"AE navE","date":"2017-06-29T03:08:31.012+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, i exited the game and Im sitting in the client with a screen saying reconnect in a rectangle lol and i hit reconnect to go into load screen and it just says unable to reconnect please check your internet and my internet is fine its the server","replies":[{"poster":"VoltixLuvsFromis","date":"2017-06-29T03:09:51.166+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=AE navE,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=eOHAAzfM,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2017-06-29T03:08:31.012+0000)\n>\n> No, i exited the game and Im sitting in the client with a screen saying reconnect in a rectangle lol and i hit reconnect to go into load screen and it just says unable to reconnect please check your internet and my internet is fine its the server\n\nSame :/ T-T","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"VoltixLuvsFromis","date":"2017-06-29T02:41:14.049+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah.
