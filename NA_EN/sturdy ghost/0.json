Than Mag!c Esports may be the team for you. We are looking to fill out our roster which requires the following roles:\n\n-Top\n-Mid\n-Jungle\n\nIf you are one of these roles and fit the appropriate ranking then this team may be for you! Currently we have no requirements about role playstyles but as the team starts to come together we will build around it more. (IE a person plays more carry top laners, we will want to then focus on a more supportive type of mid laner who can play zilean, lulu, etc.) \n\nWe prefer you to be 16 years or older for maturity reasons. No flaming, no toxicity needed. We are willing to work with you to help you to improve yourself both as a player and a teammate. We have a manager who is willing to review games and scrim with us to help us improve and allows him to give us personalized advice.\n\nIf you don&#039;t want to add us in game then please comment with the following info:\n\nIGN:\nRole:\nRank:\nRank Last Season:\nPlaystyle:\nTop 3 Champs For Your Role:\nStrengths:\nWeaknesses:\n\nOtherwise feel free to send us a message in game:\n\n{{champion:412}} \nIGN: Sturdy Ghost\nRole: Support\n\n{{champion:222}} \nIGN: Cheezit Jesus\nRole: ADC\n\n{{champion:25}} \nIGN: Prior of the Ori\nRole: Mid\n\n{{champion:68}} \nIGN: Draxgun\nRole: Top\n\n{{champion:79}} \nIGN: Solarica\nRole: Jungle","replies":[{"poster":"DungeonBossVeig","date":"2016-12-31T00:11:10.246+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"IGN: god of tea\nRole: mid\nRank: p2\nRank Last Season:d4\nPlaystyle:depends on champions but excel on both supportive and aggressive champions/matchups\nTop 3 Champs For Your Role: viktor, taliyah, ahri\nStrengths: Can learn new champions easily, shotcall well, decision making is 9/10, open to critism \nWeaknesses: Some matchups I can struggle a lot, expect more out of my team than they can actually accomplish at times.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SheBrokeMe","date":"2016-12-30T18:28:01.228+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"IGN: LittleBlueOne\nRole: Jungle\nRank: Gold 5\nRank Last Season: Plat 5\nPlaystyle: whatever fits the moment\nTop 3 Champs For Your Role: Eve, Ivern, Vi\nStrengths: Game knowledge \nWeaknesses: Greed","replies":[{"poster":"Sturdy Ghost","date":"2016-12-30T18:39:25.257+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=LittleBlueOne,realm=NA,application-id=K6EGEal2,discussion-id=FlNBxGLW,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2016-12-30T18:28:01.228+0000)\n>\n> IGN: LittleBlueOne\n> Role: Jungle\n> Rank: Gold 5\n> Rank Last Season: Plat 5\n> Playstyle: whatever fits the moment\n> Top 3 Champs For Your Role: Eve, Ivern, Vi\n> Strengths: Game knowledge \n> Weaknesses: Greed\n\nSent you a request in game, have a few questions for you and then we can setup a time for you to try out.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sturdy Ghost","date":"2016-12-31T20:16:44.683+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We have filled the slots of our Primary team, we are still looking for slots for a secondary fill in team.

(I mostly played alone so never took it to seriously but I have 5 years of experience)\n\nPlaystyle: I can adapt to any play style easily, I usually tend to be more passive but that's because I have been alone.\n\nTop 3 champs: Morgana, Lux, Veigar. (Or any mage type)\n\nStrengths: Incredible communication, map awareness, warding, and roaming.\n\nWeaknesses: I have little team experience compared to my total play time, I ran a team for 2 months with schedules training times and did shot calling but every ones time zones were way off and we couldn't keep it together. On rare occasions during team fights with way more actions taking place then usual I get a little confused, so I mostly play champs like Morgana for good AoE engage so I don't have to focus to much. I just need more practice with a good team for that. \n\nI am free almost every day in the afternoon past 1:30pm (Central Time) till about 8:30ish. I am a 26yr old stay at home father of 3.","replies":[]}]}
