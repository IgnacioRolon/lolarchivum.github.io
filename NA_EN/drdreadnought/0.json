These include the shop menu, names, and health bars. The best description is that part of the piece blinks out briefly, but the maps/character models are visible and don't seem affected. The worst culprit is the shop menu, but that may just be because it is the largest. I run the game on low settings and my FPS seems to be unaffected, running at 80-100 fps. Repair from corrupted files and the new patch did not fix the problem. I'm running windows 10 with an integrated graphics card, so its not a bad card (or at least I hope its not). This has been occurring since mid December and is only affecting league so far as I can tell.\r\nThanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-15T05:23:21.899+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even though your fps seems to be stable, I would absolutely check for any possible driver updates just to be sure you're covering all your bases.

Followed the steps in the FPS guide and I have nothing that would be causing an overlay (do not use curse/twitch/discord)","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-18T01:36:33.857+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No worries on the late reply, we're always here fam (well.....except my weekends of course xD, poros gotta rest too)\n\nIf that flickering isn't being caused by some kind of overlay and you've already checked for driver updates, there *is* a small chance this might be happening is your integrated graphics card isn't up to snuff. I don't want to jump to that conclusion of course, so let's try a couple other things. \n\nLet's try turning on low-spec mode and close client during game if you haven't tried those yet. Also, maybe some of your video settings are a little confused, so we could give those a hard reset to see if it helps as well!\n\n- Log into the game client\n- Navigate to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\\n- Delete the folder named **Config**\n- Go into a practice game and verify that settings have saved properly. \n- Leave game to sync settings","replies":[{"poster":"DrDreadnought","date":"2018-02-01T02:21:24.819+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Broporo, wanted to let you know I figured out a workaround to the problem I was having in case it pops up for anyone else.

Neither of those fixes worked. If it helps, I'm using the Intel HD Graphics 4600 on an i5-5690K. It honestly might be my pc, to be honest. Main reason I thought it was League based is its only happening in League, not with videos, general use, or in Civ 5","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
