Now the problem is that my computer will freeze and restart. Plus, the patch time for league of legends is over 700 minutes long. I have good internet and my brothers do not struggle with their patch times. I do not use wifi. It usually gets a portion of the way done and either bug splat or freezes. What can be causing this? I replaced the mobo recently to fix other issues I had but now I have this one.\r\n\r\n  Specs:\r\n1. windows 10\r\n2. i5-7600k\r\n3. evga 1060 sc\r\n4. evga ddr4 2400 2x8gb\r\n5. evga 650w supernova gold plus\r\n6. asus tuf z270 mark 2 mobo\r\n7. 1tb 7200rpm WD Black Hdd\r\n8. cooler master evo 212\r\n9. 2x120mm exhaust fans\r\n10. 2x140mm intake fans\r\n\r\nI believe it is my psu or HDD, but I do not know much about computers so. My ram past the windows mem test. I really do not know how to test my psu. It even freezes up on internet explorer sometimes. I disabled gpu and it still does the same . \r\n\r\nWhat causes these super slow/long patch times and all the bug splats?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-17T04:18:09.202+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If your pc is freezing up on only IE sometimes this might not be related to League overall, but let's take a crack at it. This *could* be some kind of weird sign of packet loss or something blocking your connection from getting a stable link with the servers.\n\nI'd like you to run a traceroute to our NA servers to check for packet loss first. Run a trace to 104.160.131.1 for about 5-10 min and post those results here so I can take a look. Please be sure to block out the top line as well!","replies":[]}]}
