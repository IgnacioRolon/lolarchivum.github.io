AND it is stupid as all hell. I have to wait 2 hours right now because I crashed in nemesis draft. its two hours because I crashed earlier today in a ranked game. Riot you need to fix your Sh**. excuse my language. I'm sorry but its stupid.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-23T17:15:42.807+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Some players have been experiencing crashes in champion select as a result of third party programs interacting poorly with league.  As a first step, remove any apps like play.tv.  This should get you fixed up, but let me know if your issue persists!","replies":[{"poster":"FiddlerSticks","date":"2016-08-29T22:48:39.707+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"its not just me. my entire friend pool has this happen to them. its nothing third party. I don't have anything third party. Riot's client just crashes. it happens to everyone. I wouldn't be mad about it if it didn't crash in champion select. honest. you guys need to make it so if you crash or close the client it will allow you to reconnect. I've tallied up all the LP and Time that was lost due to only crashing in champion select. and I tell you. I would be in platinum if no crashes happened. it becomes too much when crashes cost you over 300 LP and over 20 hours of queue bans. This new client that you guys are making better be amazing and not crash 2 times per day. and if you're wondering, yes I have tried to fix this, yes I have repaired my client, and yes, I have reinstalled league of legends. Also I know this isn't just a problem with my client because every single person I know that plays LoL have this happen to them on a regular basis.","replies":[]}]}]}
