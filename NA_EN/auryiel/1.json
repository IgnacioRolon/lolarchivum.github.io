When we were capturing the images to be used for the comic it switched Jayce to the enemy team, hence the red gate, and we didn't catch it until now. We've already recaptured the image to show a blue gate and it'll be updated soon.\n\nSorry again for any confusion this may have caused but thank you for letting us know.\n\nCheers!","replies":[{"poster":"Remlap1223","date":"2015-05-04T22:51:04.424+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot name without being red with fistbump logo.\n\n****","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-05-05T00:36:23.036+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"He's legit! :P","replies":[{"poster":"Remlap1223","date":"2015-05-05T02:40:55.276+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well if Katey says you're legit Larry, then that's good enough for me.
