Going inactive to check on something outside of game can leave your team behind, and it's not fair to your teammates. Low priority queues are only given when there is a trend of disconnections from matches. If you're disconnecting often, please let me know and I'll do my best to assist you in troubleshooting the issue.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KuntleyT0B9King","date":"2016-07-21T07:52:44.406+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"it needs to be fixed. we were both in out lane before minions spawned.\nalso, he didn't get punished whatsoever and i left spawn pool before he reconnected even...","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-07-21T09:16:11.023+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It isn't broken.
