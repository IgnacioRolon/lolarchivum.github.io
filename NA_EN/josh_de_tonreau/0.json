I feel like top lane gets at least 70% of the ganks and the lane is huge and curvy so i feel very unsafe in that lane. it&#039;s just too much going on. i feel like even though mid is in the middle and can get ganked by the entire team on both sides, i still feel safer cuz its just smaller. even bot is better cuz at least you have two people to help each other plus a champ who&#039;s warding the region. top offers the least protection and even gets the most neglect usually. it drags out the longest and you&#039;ll find your top laners still dueling like 27 minutes into the game with both towers still up. \r\n\r\ntl:dr delete top lane","replies":[]}
