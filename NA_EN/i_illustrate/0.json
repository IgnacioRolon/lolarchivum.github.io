So I thought I would just reset it, right? When I clicked through, it said I would get the reset through my e-mail I used for the account, but I never got the e-mail, no matter how many times I tried. Maybe I just have the wrong e-mail, but I tried every single one I know. I spent well over $200 on that account, and it sucks that I can't get on. \r\n\r\nI know there are patching issues right now, but is there any way for me to fix it?\r\nUsername: Phoenixofsnow","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-21T23:33:50.910+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmmm that is a little worrisome if the password reset wasn't sent to the email you thought it would go to. There's a chance that could mean someone was able to get your email changed, in which case I'd suggest hitting up our account team in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) by picking the option \"I need help recovering my account\". They'll be able to see what's happening and get the reset sent to the email you need.","replies":[]}]}
