I've been struggling with BEX crashes. (which no one seems to know what those errors are :(  )  Most recently it happened to me last night, where I was just wrapping up with champ select about to load into a game and BOOM crash. My computer couldn't restart fast enough before a remake  was called. Clicking the reconnect button in client just goes right  back to crashing again. So naturally I got leaverbuster, which on the one hand I am totally cool with, (because I've been in that situation losing a teammate) but at the same time now each and every one of my games is doing the low priority queue. Bottomline, did the duration of leaverbuster increase? I mean I am only getting 5 minute increments which I don't mind waiting. Just the fact it has not gone away yet I guess is my problem.  Just hoping for a bit of light on the subject. Thanks :)","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-09T18:31:17.213+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"[Leaverbuster](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ) is unchanged, so the LPQ will continue to escalate if more leaves are accrued.  Meaning that both the timer and the requirement amount of games would increase.  \n\nFor now, I don't recommend queuing up for matchmade games and stick to custom games to troubleshoot.  In the meantime, it does sound like your connection is struggling to transition to the game server so the steps in our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide should help resolve this.","replies":[{"poster":"CheyLioness","date":"2017-09-09T19:41:13.515+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll give this a shot, but as far as the leaver buster, the time is not increasing. It is staying at 5 minutes, after the 1 match I had an issue with yesterday. However, after the four games I have successfully joined with no issues (lag or other wise) it is requiring me to wait the 5 minutes in order to play again. So instead of having me wait 5 minutes after the leaver match, then proceeding with regular queue like normal, it continues through my next games, each at 5 minutes. I hope that makes a little bit more sense.","replies":[{"poster":"Chermorg","date":"2017-09-09T20:13:37.183+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"LeaverBuster penalties are generally for 5 games - so if you got a 5 minute queue, you should have one more game left of waiting 5 minutes.","replies":[{"poster":"CheyLioness","date":"2017-09-09T20:26:25.619+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Porocles,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=9cxJT1ou,comment-id=000000000001,timestamp=2017-09-09T20:17:56.795+0000)\n>\n> You currently have one game left with this leaverbuster timer, after that you should be in the clear.
