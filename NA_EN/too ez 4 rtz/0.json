I'm talking about connectivity not FPS. no where have i ever seen this mentioned before and i am totally lost. i don't even think this should be a thing.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-06-14T22:39:17.581+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your network might be suffering from packet loss here, which would appear as your ping skyrocketing.
