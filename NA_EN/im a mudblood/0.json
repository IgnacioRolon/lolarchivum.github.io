Especially if you add the ability to always have 1 reroll if you queue in ranked aram. but regardless, people who would  be playing ranked ARAM are there because they obviously enjoy playing ARAM so they know that  the champions are randomized, whether promos or not. i just think if 3v3 has comp  then why not aram? even if just for funsies.","replies":[]}
