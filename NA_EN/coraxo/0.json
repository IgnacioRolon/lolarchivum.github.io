Please don't let us down :c","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":21,"down_votes":11,"body":"Hello Riot.\n\nYou promised us a while ago that you&#039;ll be looking to buff/change Nidalee a little bit in patch 7.1, She currently has the lowest win rate in several servers and 2nd / 3rd lowest win rate in the others.\n\nShe&#039;s extremely unplayable right now, i understand she was one of the most &quot;broken&quot; champions (not really) but her having 40% win rate is extremely unhealthy for any champion. And her kit isn&#039;t outdated like Nunu to have such win rate.\n\nI personally always believed you were nerfing her in the wrong way in season 6, the reason she was broken is mostly because of Strength Of The Ages, not because of her kit. As you remember she wasn&#039;t this good at the beginning of season 5 EVEN though she weren&#039;t nerfed at all!\nYou changed her passive, delayed her Q toss, removed auto attack reset from R, you made W cooldown so high + the reset on it AND you nerfed all her abilities (remember, all of this changes didn&#039;t happen in season 5 and she wasn&#039;t that good).\nOf course you were trying to nerf her without completely deleting this champion, for example you buffed some of her abilities like the execution damage on her Q, and she was actually okay at the end of season 6.\n\nAfter the removal of SOTA she got weak, as if it wasn&#039;t enough that jungle camps got stronger (Raptors + Golems), i think if you lower the cooldown reset on her Pounce (W) she would get much better.\n\n\nTL;DR in MY opinion the biggest reason she was one of the best junglers is because of Strength Of The Ages plus a few little things (like Rylai&#039;s Crystal Scepter and Road Of Ages before both items got nerfed)\n\nRiot, i ask you here nicely to look onto buffing or changing Nidalee in someway. I have the most fun playing this champion and i never get bored of playing her.\n\nThanks for reading.","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2017-01-05T19:59:05.183+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":5,"body":"We'll be buffing Nid in 7.2.

Laning will never be balanced on her because of her playstyle. She lands a spear and goes in, that's it. if she doesn't land a spear she doesn't go in because cougar is too weak without the perks of hunt. If she lands a spear, her enemies immediately know she's going to go in and can mentally prepare themselves for it, making it impossible to lane against certain champions.\n\nOld Nidalee worked in mid as AP, top as AD/tank and even in jungle back then, though it was rough. She could be played support or even adc, though she wasn't top tier in those roles, you could manage it. She was balanced around her playstyles; top AD was great at splitpushing and 1v1ing but provided a lot less to teamfights. Mid AP she was incredibly weak early and had a lot of trouble csing because she didn't have cougar level 1, she won lane by outplaying her opponent and consistently landing long range spears. If she didn't land spears she wouldn't be winning lane, if she did land spears she would be winning lane. Until 6, where she could have a lot more mind game pressure with cougar form. You could be csing and randomly cougar all in an opponent, if you did it right then you could actually out trade people. AP Nid was squishy and fell short against hard engage, or even just an assassin that can keep up with her/cc her.\n\nPlease consider changing her back. New Nidalee is the epitome of boring. Spears don't feel rewarding, traps are a literally useless ability now. Cougar feels terrible unless you land a spear and even then they expect it so it's fairly common to be predicted and turned on because of how obvious your decision train is.\n\nOld spears, old traps without %mr/armor shred, old cougar, keep cougar W direction change with the rework, keep the smaller hitbox on spears to make it harder to land them / allow cooler spear plays between minions (which we don't get to see after rework anyway because she's a jungler).\n\nDoing that would make Nid a fun, flexible champion again, she'll have counterplay and be easier to balance as you don't have to account for best/worst case scenarios of hunt. You can just balance her as a champion as she is.","replies":[{"poster":"NineTailedMystic","date":"2017-01-06T02:12:10.914+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":3,"body":"Old Spears as in the nuclear warheads the width of a tree?

If you want to compare them compare their bests with their bests and their worsts with their worsts.\n\nBest:\nOld Nid could 1/2-3/4 chunk you with a decent spear as a mid lane champ. That is the slowest skillshot in the game, single target, her only non melee damage source and it has to hit you at a far range. She was strong because of this in a siege position. If you let a Nidalee siege then you were not playing against her correctly, unless you have one of the champions with kits to counter siege (yasuo, braum, etc.).\n\nNew Nid, when not completely terrible due to numbers, completely shits on enemy junglers with very little counter play. She will kill them multiple times in their own jungle and escape without his allies being able to clean her up due to her pounce over walls.  She still sieges okay, so she transitions well into the mid-late game, she just has a lot less counters overall and is a much more boring champion.\n\nWorst:\nOld Nid had a very weak laning phase, was easily pushed into tower and outroamed pre-6. Her spears were her lane presence and she had no mobility to get away from ganks. Her mid-late game relied on her team grouping and sieging with her, but an enemy team with hard engage countered that. New champs/items will also make it even easier to deal with her specifically if need be.\n\nNew Nid has to all in, but typically early game that doesn't matter as she is invading jungle.

But I still do recall Diamondprox playing Gragas jungle full tank, a patch or two before S5's preseason in Gambit's relegation matches.

With a nerfed spear hitbox? Yeah, cool. I can feel even more pressured to land my spears now and my enemies can feel even worse that they got chunked for 80% of their health bar from 1400 units away. Will she be viable again? Possibly. Fun? Enjoyable? Healthy? Maybe not. \n\nI believe the reason you feel currently Nidalee is boring is because two years of nerfs have finally caught up with her now that she can't abuse the systems around her as hard as she did for those two seasons. If anything, I'd love it if spears were just a bit more rewarding to hit and hell, I REALLY wish her traps were meaningful again outside of proccing your passive. \n\nBut these are all moving parts of her kit and now she's got way more levers to pull depending on what they'd like to push her into. Personally, I'd love to see her Cougar E apply a \"bleed\" of sorts. Makes sense thematically and will bring her teamfighting up a fair bit, while still requiring her to dive into the thick of the fight. But that's just my ideas and that won't help AD Nidalee at all. \n\nI also would love it if she could feel better about her itemisation, but that isn't a Nidalee-specific problem. She currently likes CDR very much, she needs health to get into melee and she still needs to itemise around Luden's if she wants to have any presence in the game. Almost feels like I need a 7th slot on every bruiser-ish mage, just because Void Staff is so mandatory, yet I still need Rabaddon's because the rest of the items hardly give any AP anymore. On the other hand, she's pretty diverse with her itemisation depending on how you wanna play, which is nice.\n","replies":[{"poster":"Norak","date":"2017-01-07T06:19:13.402+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your post doesn't make sense; you agree that old Nidalee was viable in more roles, in more lanes and with more builds, yet you say she was very one dimensional.

He usually comes up with very smart ways to move power from one place of the kit to another. I understand making her traps powerful would tax a lot of her power budget since it's going to be plenty of hidden power, but please do something about them. Currently they are the least interesting part of her kit and the only purpose to them seems to be to proc her passive onto unsuspecting victims. \n\nAlso, if you are looking into reverting jungle camp respawn timers, to reduce how much time junglers have to gank after clearing their jungle, then please be careful. She might come back as a monster omnipotent jungler again. As much as I wanna see her being powerful and super-exciting as a high-skill champion, I don't want another year of nerfs every second patch.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Aethiala","date":"2017-01-05T21:53:20.999+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"So Nidalee buffs are cool.
