When it is checked, it helps to improve in game fps, but it also increases wait time to get to the scoreboard screen. Unchecking this option would possibly reduce your fps if you have a low spec machine, but it will improve the wait time for the scoreboard at the end of the game.\n\nIf that's not the problem, then it may be a slow [connection issue](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) or possibly a [low spec machine](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752654-Minimum-and-Recommended-System-Requirements).","replies":[]}]}
