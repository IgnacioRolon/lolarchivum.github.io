Rules: No World Runes. Shurima doesn't get any Ascended besides Nasus in battles but it's fully rebuild (Azir doesn't go to fight unless the capital is under attack). Demacia gets 3 years of prep while Shurima only gets 1. \r\nI might redo this after Kayle and Morgana rework as they are most probably from Demacia and I'll include in that one Azir and Renekton in battles too, but for the time being I am bored so I decided to do this.\r\nSo any thoughts and arguments about which side would win and why?","replies":[{"poster":"Warlord Dienekes","date":"2018-10-25T03:53:59.980+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly, the nations of this setting are not developed enough to be able to give a satisfactory answer to this question.\n\nHere is a brief list of the information we'd need to know before we could even begin drawing conclusions.\n\n1) How large is the entire army of either state\n2) How well equipped is that army\n3) How well trained is the army as well as the elite units\n4) How fast can either army move\n5) How does armor work in this setting\n6) How populous are either state\n7) Where is that population distributed\n8) How much resources can each state call upon\n9) How long does it take to mobilize these resources\n10) What are the available means of resupply\n11) How developed are their food storage systems\n12) What network of allies can be called upon\n13) How secure is the leadership\n14) What is the life expectancy of the current administration\n15) How likely are internal struggles going to mess up the state when the current administration dies\n \nNow, in terms of army vs army.  Demacia does have a fantastic advantage when it comes to war, since they have flying bird mounts.  However, everything Riot's written about these raptor knights kinda shows that they're being used in the most inefficient way possible.  So, how dramatic the difference they can make is somewhat negated.\n\nThen we can get into the details of leadership.  Napoleon may have been the greatest general of his era.  And the army of France may have had more experienced men, and a far greater understanding of war than Russia.  But because they didn't have the foresight on what materials to bring on their conquest they were eventually beaten back (though this is a gross oversimplification).\n\nIt's entirely possible that a war can be changed based on the decisions of a handful of people that cannot be predicted.  If one side has a Yi Sun-Sin and the other side doesn't, then the impossible can happen.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2018-10-24T22:46:00.252+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why are they at war?

(Noxus and Bilgewater are probably at the cutting edge of food preservation tech.)  Pretty sure Demacians aren't trained for desert warfare, either - and their standard operating behavior (usually in friendly or near-friendly territory) might completely fail them.  You can just imagine them running out of water, failing to predict or avoid sandstorms, or being subject to pretty horrific sunstroke.\n\nIt's yet to be seen how Dormun would fare in lands other than Shurima - it's possible they'd get hoof rot, or just get sick and die from the cold and humidity.  It's very likely that Shuriman soldiers would also have to find clothing and equipment that would better serve them in those foreign lands too - and that wouldn't be difficult on the individual basis, but equipping entire armies would require, for example, huge sources of cloth to just clothe them.  Foods that they might be used to keeping dried, might rot in record breaking time, wounds that would otherwise be ok, could get infected much faster than they'd expect, and even the methods that they use for navigating (the sun and stars) might be covered by perpetual clouds for days or weeks on end.\n\nThey'd all be out of their element, so the 'home territory' advantage would be astronomical.","replies":[{"poster":"Ifneth","date":"2018-10-25T08:50:04.668+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have you thought about the Raptors’ uses more deeply?  I’ve written about this in a thread, and I want to know what you think.\n\n1) ISR.  Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaisance.  Raptors can move agents and assets to, from, and around an operation.  They can fly over an area to spot enemy activity, or deliver scouts to points of interest.\n\n2) Communication.  Raptors can deliver messages between units or between command and subordinate elements to move information and orders faster than a horse can ride, letting the Demacian army act faster the enemy can handle.\n\n3) Light transport.  Vital equipment, individuals, or wounded troops can be carried by Raptors far faster than anything else.  The army would never need to wait for anything.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ChunLii","date":"2018-10-24T23:54:53.376+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Iirc a Rioter said that Demacia has bad offence but good defence.
