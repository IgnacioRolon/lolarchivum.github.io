I believe that the very short answer is that Sona is a support, and very few like playing support. Ahri is part of 2 very popular classes (Assassins and Mages) and she rarely falls entirely out of the meta. ADCs can be incredible fun, and MF similarly is almost always a decent pick. Whether or not they're better looking is a matter of personal taste; If we go by base skin I think Sona looks the best, but if skins are eligible SG Ahri takes the cake for me.\n\n(There's also the argument that MF and Ahri get more/better skins, although that one's more of a chicken and egg scenario; are they popular because they have more/better skins or do they get better/more skins because they're more popular.)","replies":[{"poster":"Nylisa","date":"2018-07-30T20:44:38.790+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh no no i know you didn't say that, just clearing it up that's all :D and as you said i was contemplating the story of egg and chicken as well!","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Daedric Etwahl","date":"2018-07-30T10:38:12.278+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh yeah, honestly it starts to make my skin crawl a little bit with all the boob comments, hiding behind the overused \"personality\" joke...\n\nDont get me wrong, to me Sona is the most beautiful and attractive champ in the game.
