I'm RyzeTheSmurfMage, a big Shuriman fan as some people may know although I havent posted much on boards lately. So I was looking at the regional pages on Universe, and I noticed that the Shurima page is quite.... underwhelming compared to other factions such as Demacia or Noxus (and more), especially regarding their weapons, armors, etc. So, today I'm gonna list what we know about their weaponry from stories featuring Shurima, as well as some concepts I made with the help of some people on the Discord server of League Lore (yes Falr post the link in the comments). Keep in mind this is mostly going to be about Azir's side, not Xerath's, although some weapons and styles of fighting will be similar\nSo, let's begin.\n\n#####**_~~ARMOR~~_**\n\nShurima is a desert, thus heavy armor wouldn't be a great idea. Besides slow movement, you would basically boil in the sun. Thus, Shuriman soldiers would wear light to mid-weight armor, like we saw warriors wear:\n> Lightly armored warriors streamed into the city over the rubble. They howled a dozen different war-cries, eager to begin the slaughter.\n\nTaken from Bloodline.\nBut how would this armor look like? Here comes the concept part of it. Mostly, we based it off Azir's sand soldiers and Ancient Egypt, with a few modifications.\nThe plate would look like similar to this, maybe with a Shuriman symbol at it's center. \nhttps://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/547867910111100968/597740558768668708/6ccaad72cd1660f67a2fe3e12d508379-1.jpg\nIt would be easy to wear, would provide protection, although obviosly not as much as heavy armor, while keeping mobility, which would most likely be core for desert warfare and Shuriman warfare overall (we'll go into that deeper later on). It would also fit Shuriman aesthethic.\nNow, the helmet. The helmet would most likely look like the sand soldiers (but without the gem on the head obvs).\nhttps://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/547867910111100968/597741549807206410/Screenshot_20190708-135122_Gallery.jpg\nWe also thought that it may have an incorporated veil to cover the eyes and nose, to keep the dust going up during battle from entering them and making vision harder as well as the sun light.\nThe rest, aka the limb armor, would be much like the soldiers too, offering some protection without obstructing movement.\n\n####**_~~MELLE WEAPONS~~_**\n\n\nLet's go over swords first.\n> The jackalâ€™s eyes snapped wide.\nHe saw seven of them. Their curved blades remained sheathed, but the look in their eyes spoke of martial training and guile.\n\nShurimans are known to use curved blades, although that's as much as it goes into describing them. So, what type of curved sword is specific and iconic for Ancient Egypt, from which Shurima heavly draws inspiration? The Kopesh.\nhttps://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/547867910111100968/597743045563252746/DemoShot.jpgb340c207-3a35-4e7b-879e-77c49773c02dOriginal.jpg\nOf course, it wouldn't be the only type of sword used, although imo it would be the most common one, as it's very good for slashing, which would be very effective against light armored enemies or openings in limb armor. It would also enable mobile style of fighting, since its a 1 handed weapon. It's a 1 handed sword, weilded by a light or mid armored combatant tho, so a shield for the other hand would be essential. So, why not the same design as Imperial Shurima used?\nhttps://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/547867910111100968/597744101474959360/Screenshot_20190708-140105_Discord.jpg\nIt's 1 handed, and it would provide enough protection. \nNow, there's also another type of shield Shurimans use that we know of.\n> Five hundred warriors at least; light skirmishers, whooping horse-archers, and fighting men bearing scale shields and heavy axes. \n\nShurimans cover the shields with scales, presumably from animals. This 1 Shurima animal comes to my mind that appears to have hard scales:\nhttps://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/547867910111100968/597744950649552926/shurima_sandswimmer_01_1.jpg\nThe sand swimmers.\nI assume the scales are durable enough to make for a shield plate since they are used as shield plate.\n\nNow for axes, as seen in the paragraph quoted above, they use heavy axes. Nasus's own axe may give an idea of what form Shuriman axes have, and I'd add to that Egyptian axes:\nhttps://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/547867910111100968/597745870292779028/7200edb40f7420dcfd51a1e4b22aaf36.jpg\nThis one also comes to my mind as something that could fit\nhttps://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/547867910111100968/597747611856011264/2i4-FM1934-2_grande.jpg\n\nNow for spears. Spears would be crucial for Shurimans. They give range, and the ability to poke with them while staying behind your shield. Short ones can also be thrown. They would also be extremly good in desert, since there would be no close spaces to not be able to manuever and get your spear stuck.\nSo, how would they look like design-wise?\nFor long spears, the image from Where Icathia once Stood comes to mind.\nhttps://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/457316449594245150/565583598636498945/c-o-runeterra-void-05.jpg\nBasically, a common long spear. \nWe also know Shurimans use other types of spears too, aka shorter spears.\nFrom Varus's color story we know they use hooked spears:\n> Tanned, wolf-lean men worked the ruins, digging out hidden reliquary chambers as thick-limbed beasts of burden dragged excavated rocks from deeper inside the structure. Warriors wearing boiled leather breastplates and carrying hook-bladed spears guarded the perimeter.\nSo I suspect something similar to this\nhttps://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/547867910111100968/597747958943055892/0632271d7acc56358d3a7981c05e6c52.jpg\nWe also saw Kala from Ryze's comic \"Burning Lands\" weilding a spear.\nhttps://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/547867910111100968/597748431863283737/Screenshot_20190708-141844_Chrome.jpg\n\n\n##**_~~RANGED WEAPONS~~_**\n\nBows. Bows are used by everyone (except people that have guns. Not Shurima's case). Here we don't have much to talk about. Basically, common bows would be used. We do know Shurima has horse archers tho.\n>  Five hundred warriors at least; light skirmishers, whooping horse-archers, and fighting men bearing scale shields and heavy axes. \n\nAnd why not, let's also add a Shuriman-esque design to a bow \nhttps://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/547867910111100968/597749298532319303/Auriels_bow.png\nYes I know it's from Skyrim but it fits Shurima aesthethic so well that I think it would be the best example.\n\n\n##**_~~SPECIAL FORCES~~_**\n\nRegarding special/elite forces, we actually have some info. We have the raiders, and altough they are, well, raiders, I doubt coin wouldnt buy them (and Azir has if anything a shit ton of money).\nhttps://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/547867910111100968/597750025438756874/shurima_valley_02.jpg\n> The raiders of Shurima survive not through trade, but through violence. These bands of marauders often attempt to blend into the environment in order to lure unsuspecting travelers into traps before killing them, taking their belongings, and (in very rare cases) eating them.\n\nThese ones would be very good for ambushes\nhttps://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/547867910111100968/597750025438756875/shurima_valley_03.jpg\n\n> These nomadic raiders are known for their agility, using hardened bone-braces and polearms to vault towards their victims at terrifying speeds.\n\nWhile these ones would be very good for, well, ambushes too, along with chasing down the enemy, and quick harras attacks in the enemy line while they are traveling \n\nAnd now, my own creation (alongside Vartius's), the Shuriman Palace Guards. They would be guards of high ranking officials, captains, and generals.\nhttps://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/547867910111100968/597751170206793748/unknown-44.png\n\nThis is how their helmet would look like.\nhttps://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/547867910111100968/597751308405178380/unknown-51.png\n\nAnd this, is how their weapons would be like. Vartius had drawn inspiration here from the sand soldier spears, and modified the blades a bit. This weapon would be extremly versatile thanks to the blades on the sides, but also hard to master, making it an optimal weapon for elite guards.\n\n#**_~~COMBAT STYLE~~_**\n\nSo, I mentioned above I'll go more in depth about possible Shuriman combat style. I would like something to make them unique among other factions, while being accuarate to their background and battlefield, aka the desert. So, I'd go with a mobile style of fighting, as said above. Not only it would be optimal for marching in the desert because it isnt recomended to wear heavy armor there and you would also move faster, but it would also enable the fighter to use his weapons faster in combat (less weight from armor=more manuevrability). Noxus has raw numbers and diversity in battle styles. Demacia has the best armor and weapons in the world, as well as the most elite soldiers, all of them having heavy equipment. Shurima would have mobility, and precision. Why precision? We know Shurimans are accuarate enough with the bow to be able to shoot while riding horses (from paragrahps quoted above), and it would also be an unique characteristic to them that other regions don't have much focus on. \nIn overall army, I'd say that Shurima would be betwen Noxus and Demacia. By that, I mean they would have better quality in soldiers than Noxus (the average warband soldiers I mean. Basically they are giving minimal training to be able to replace the fallen soldiers in expansion wars by executing commands,  having discipline to the superiors, and other typical training stuff, the weapon they are the best at, then sent to battle), although obvs not as good as Demacia, but less soldiers than Noxus, altough obvs not as many as Demacia. Aka a middle ground betwen the 2.\n\n\nSo there it was. I hope you enjoyed reading my thread, it was a lot of fun to write. I would love to have the Shurima art gallery on the region page expanded more to have actual canon representations of the things I listed, and not just armor and weapons, but maybe even how the capital of Shurima looks from the inside, and how Nerimazeth looks like, and maybe even how normal tools look like (for the capital part I may add that we have 4 images of it and all of them show the same thing)","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2019-07-08T17:35:23.112+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":0,"body":"I reached out to Graham to ask about the scale-shields, and, paraphrasing, he said he had been thinking of something kite-shield-like, and with actual scales on it - likely from a sandswimmer (but possibly claimed to be from dragons).

In Runeterra, I'd imagine that cutlass designs were inspired by curved Shuriman blades (both types, but mostly the scimitars if they use them). Noxians, Demacians, and Freljordians tend to use straighter blades. Ionian katanas and etc. are curved but are lighter; I doubt they've taken much inspiration from them (though maybe some, as Ionia is fairly close to Bilgewater).\n\nYes I would imagine more modern Shurimans using scimitars than the old Egyptian-style armies of the empire; modern Shurima seems to be a bit more similar to the medieval Middle East than Ancient Shurima. Though it's possible that some troops used it at least in Azir's day. Should Azir build up his army back to full strength, I'd imagine there would be more of a mix of swords in the modern army. Maybe a mix of modern and ancient in the other Shuriman weapons too.","replies":[{"poster":"RyzeTheSmurfMage","date":"2019-07-09T15:59:25.376+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=EdgeLady,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=A5RGYV5A,comment-id=000400000000,timestamp=2019-07-09T15:51:37.547+0000)\n>\n> Ah yes you're right, good catch, but the design is similar.

In-universe logic, since lots of people would join Xerath who would be against the return of Azir, the empire, and it's traditions and 2. Familiar tropes; scimitars and similar swords are wielded by the villains in a lot of media. Plus if, in League's universe, the pirate cutlasses are directly based off of the scimitars, they would certainly be based off the more dirty and cutthroat of the two blades, wouldn't they be?

They fear Azir \n2. Azir's return would be bad for their business \n3.

And I thought mobility and precision would be the best. And yeah shields are kinda necessary. Also, if you can show me an image of a heavly armored egyptian I'd be very thankfull (maybe I can draw inspiration to make some concepts about heavy troops although I think they would be rare)","replies":[{"poster":"Warlord Dienekes","date":"2019-07-10T13:36:25.961+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Early modern Mamluk\n\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f0/Ottoman_Mamluk_horseman_circa_1550.jpg\n\nHigh medieval Mamluk (the ones with spears, should be noted their mail is covered in cloth)\n\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ab/BattleOfHoms1299.JPG/800px-BattleOfHoms1299.JPG","replies":[{"poster":"RyzeTheSmurfMage","date":"2019-07-10T16:03:48.068+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Warlord Dienekes,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=A5RGYV5A,comment-id=000600000000,timestamp=2019-07-10T13:36:25.961+0000)\n>\n> Early modern Mamluk\n> \n> https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f0/Ottoman_Mamluk_horseman_circa_1550.jpg\n> \n> High medieval Mamluk (the ones with spears, should be noted their mail is covered in cloth)\n> \n> https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ab/BattleOfHoms1299.JPG/800px-BattleOfHoms1299.JPG\n\nThose could very well be used for Xerath's side imo they look very similar-ish to what I imagined for Xerath's armies","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"14daysuspensionk","date":"2019-07-09T21:44:14.865+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We know that Azir wears a birb shaped helmet.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mephala","date":"2019-07-08T18:28:21.109+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As for the soldier needing lighter armor for being in a desert.

But they would move easier that way, and it would also enable more mobile combat fighting (aka smth to make Shuriman military unique. Every other military from a named faction is unique in Runeterra regarding an aspect)","replies":[]}]}]}
