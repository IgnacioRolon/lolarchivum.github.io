His knowledge and use of the arcane is probably unrivaled in its complexity and depth, and is worthy of recognition and respect. But Ryze has never been shown to wield the sheer power that the demigods do. I have no problem saying Ryze is the most versatile mage, or the most knowledgeable, or the most rapid spellslinger, or that he could beat Xerath in a race across Shurima (duh), or that he has the most accurate understanding of the fundamental properties of magic. But none of his shown feats of power have rivaled Syndra or Azir.\n\nSeriously, if he did _anything_ that signals truly massive levels of power, I'd gladly put Ryze on my demigod tier list.\n\n>Ah also Ryze wasn't going all out before he got stabbed he could have just started with the Spell Flux and kill them all at once.\n\nSpeculation that is unlikely and uncharacteristic of Ryze. He's not the type of character to _not_ go \"all out\" for no reason. He takes his mission seriously, and won't risk falling to some soldier's stab. Sona was most likely there because he needed her help and couldn't have done it without her.\n\nThere is a wild card we don't mention about Ryze's power, the scroll he carries. Brand even threatened to take it for himself as part of his plan in Burning Lands. If anything buffs Ryze, I think it would be that.

He has never displayed the arrogance of thinking of another person as a \"bug.\" This isn't a couple of thugs trying to mug him. He's on a mission, and he even brought a partner. Shit is going down. You can see him slinging spells back to back when someone manages to get up to him and stab him.

He just needs one city or army-raising, one win or draw vs Nasus/Syndra, one landscape changing, or one army wiping event for me to admit he is Ascended/demigod tier.\n\nPeople I think have more pure arcane power (no Void stuff) than Ryze:\n\nXerath (we agree), Bard, Syndra, Nasus-tier Ascended, Azir-tier Ascended, possibly the Aspects of Targon, the Freljordian demigods, Mordekaiser, Taliyah (she protected many of the inhabitants of a whole city), and possibly Veigar and Zilean once they're updated (time and space is so fundamental that I consider it top tier arcane power). edit: obv Aurelion Sol\n\nI'm not saying Ryze would lose to all of them. He has superior technique, and he could surely find a way to survive against or incapacitate many of them (like Taliyah or Nasus-tier Ascended). But they've been shown to just have more raw power than he does.","replies":[{"poster":"RyzeTheSmurfMage","date":"2018-08-20T17:21:48.408+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1.

Also he didn't want to destroy the whole place most likely. \n3. Telekinessis is not instant unless it's just a telekkinetic blast,  and I doubt Ryze wouldn't have the reflexes  to set up a shield and not get 1 shotted. Even ignoring that,  Syndra doesn't have durability feats nor shields nor the speed to dodge to survive an arcane beam from Ryze  (glass-cannon), even tho she has more raw-power than Ryze (at least in telekinessis where she far outclasses him and even Xerath)\n4. Agreed except for a few things. \nA. Nasus-tier Ascended.  We haven't seen Nasus show much display of his magical power. His only actually impressive feat was hurting Xerath a bit, but while that's impressive, I doubt Ryze couldn't cause Xerath some pain if he hits him first. Also Ryze's voidborn feat got even stronger some new lore just got released.  A new-born Voidborn was able to corrupt an ICEBORN in mere seconds,  while an OLD one that's high-tier didn't succed with Ryze, and that new-born Voidborn was immune to direct pickaxe hits from an Iceborn,   a being that has stamina, speed and strenght much better than a peak human. It was said the older the Voidborns get,  the more resistant they get. Ryze one-shotted an old one. \nB.Taliah \nHe protected some people of the city. Compared to Ryze's shield feat against Brand, (who may be unexperienced with the World Rune but it's a World Rune nontheless), that's not comparable. \nC.

I believe they just have more, and that it is used for regeneration, limited immortality, their larger forms, and overall durability and strength. I think they have more because they are inundated with it by the Sun Disc, but they aren't spellslingers like Ryze. If you know Ryze is more durable than Syndra, then you must acknowledge that Nasus is more durable than Ryze. That is arcane power.\n\n>Voidborn\n\nLALALA HAVEN'T READ IT YET, I'll comment again when I read it.\n\n>Taliyah\n\nRyze can make a one-man shield.

I believe they contain more arcane energy than a human like Ryze can naturally possess. In her short story, Leona makes sunfire rain from the sky - the story as she does it, so it doesn't describe the devastation, but I imagine that to be a ridiculously destructive feat of power. Some Aspects use their power in different ways (Taric doesn't destroy many things), but it's still there.","replies":[{"poster":"RyzeTheSmurfMage","date":"2018-08-20T19:01:17.428+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1.

There's no evidence Ryze can cancel her magic - Ryze rooting Yago to give himself more time is likely related to positioning, or forcing Yago to use the spell he was charging to break the Rune Prison (like Brand broke it in Burning Lands). There's no evidence it's a silence or that it interrupts magic. Maybe Ryze can beat her in a fight if he's lucky to land the first shot. Syndra still commands more sheer power.\n\n>Brand actually acts like a god among insects and it's in his character to humiliate normal humans, unlike Ryze.\n\nHe's also likely not that strong. Ryze believed he could end Brand (who possesses a World Rune) and was also about to force Kala to surrender the World Rune... despite the fact that she was wielding the World Rune. Possessing one doesn't seem to make you very strong if you don't know how to properly use it.\n\n>My point about Ryze beating Syndra still stands. Syndra can get 1 shotted by an arcane beam which is way faster than a normal arcane blast from Ryze.\n\nSyndra is shackled and locked away because her power was so immense that it corrupted the land around her. She is defined as a freak anomaly. She has an actual feat of massive power, and in her story no opponent has been shown to touch her or have the ability to resist anything she does, despite them having some magical talent. Ryze has been in and won many battles, but Syndra cannot be battled. If it had been him in the Dreaming Pool instead of Syndra in that story, there would have been some running and gunning spell slinging, someone would've landed a hit on him, and there would have been an actual scuffle. With Syndra, there was no fight. Their power is on different levels.\n\n>I was talking strictly about arcane powers in the offensive and shielding ways. Nasus is way more durable than Ryze without shields.\n\nNasus isn't a mage, but he can still probably beat Ryze in a fight due to his type of arcane power. The Ascended have been said to take on armies of mortals alone, and Nasus is a high-tier Ascended. Ryze couldn't take on a group in the monastery without help and even then sustained injury.\n\n>As I said before, some Aspects are weaker than the others.\n\nUnknown, really. Pantheon can dive like a comet from the sky, Zoe can essentially bomb an area, Diana has really no feats, and the Protector wouldn't use his power in a destructive manner.

There's nothing to indicate Ryze couldn't use the Spell Flux without them being suspended in the air, the shot didn't go upwards by itself Ryze aimed upwards cause the Navori were suspended there. Also he could have caused an explosion like he did with the Voidborn from the beggining but he didn't want to destroy the place  (already said why this feat got even more impressive and even ignoring that the SHOCKWAVE of that,  not the direct blast,  caused massive chunks of stone to fall from the roof of the cave. \n2. I just said why there is evidence. And Brand didn't even broke the Rune Prison, it got disspeled after Ryze teleported away because the caster was out of range. Also,  do you really belive those people that couldn't touch Syndra, an immobile target with no shields or reaction feats. If Ryze would wake up there,  he will first trap the first one to try to kill him,  then telekinetic grab the other 2. Or he could just set up a shield that they have no way of getting past and 1 shot with an arcane burst (bursts are like a blast,  but with a wider AoE and have an explosive effect after they reached their target. Ryze used them while fighting Yago).

A World Rune affects you immediatly unless you have the power to resist it like Ryze. Brand just picked up a Rune as Kegan and he became Brand in a few seconds.
