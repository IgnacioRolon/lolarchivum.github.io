I mean it&#039;s not that far off to think both Nashramae and Veukara have sun-disc replicas, but Nasus is in the art, and that art was in Bloodline on Veukara.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Biomarker","date":"2018-10-30T01:02:53.154+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, I'm a developer on the Map!\n\nThanks you mrmeddyman, RyzeTheSmurfMage, and DerMangoJoghurt for info on the bug.
