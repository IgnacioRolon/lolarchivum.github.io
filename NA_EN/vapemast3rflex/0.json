I have never gotten chat banned (though my friend has on his account). Never have been temp banned or anything like that (though I play with friends who have) and I come to log in today after not playing for a week and I am perma-banned :( It&#039;s a bummer considering the money I foolishly spent on the game.... I never got an E-mail as the log in says I should have received but I have submitted a ticket to try and figure out whats going on. You all have seen posts like this from various people over the past few months as I have been reading them, but I assure you that I am absolutely confused and wanted some input to see if its actually possible to not get a warning then be banned :/ Everyone who has ever played the game has gotten angry for some reason or another so don&#039;t hit me with those cliches... I am looking for someone who is educated on the topic to give me a hint on how to find out exactly what I got banned for, not just a page that tells me everything I could be banned for. To be banned with no warning that I was breaking the Summoners Code, is a little ridiculous...

More often than not the macro responses do in fact answer the question, but because they are what they are they tend to leave people rather unsatisfied/feeling like support hasn't listened.\n\nThis is especially true for those who do not understand their punishments, but such is the purpose of the PB board and the arbiters. If they feel a specific behaviour should not be ban worthy then if they bring it to boards they can get a good feel for the community view of said behaviour. \n\nBeing people, support will sometimes misread or misunderstand something (especially given the diversity of people they interact with and the difficulty in conveying tone through text) but for the most part every ticket is read and understood, and if a macro response addresses the concern then that is what they will use.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"VaPEmAsT3RFLEX","date":"2016-12-02T20:29:20.907+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is that done by submitting a ticket?","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Tantram","date":"2016-12-02T21:13:45.833+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, you'll need to submit a ticket to take care of it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LostFr0st","date":"2016-12-02T21:13:28.399+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
