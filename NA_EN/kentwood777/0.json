Can u put back pink plz ?\n\nakali is one of those \"dont bother interacting with me\" champions. If you choose to fight her, she shrouds. If you want to gank her, shroud. She trades when she wants to, then shrouds. Heals. Just a pointless laning phase.","replies":[{"poster":"Nhifu","date":"2017-10-09T17:40:04.434+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wtf are you talking about lol","replies":[{"poster":"Mysticman89","date":"2017-10-09T17:53:16.943+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"In previous seasons we had pink wards, which were basically like the modern red control wards. They revealed invisible units in the area around them, notably including akali in her shroud, which made akali almost useless against players who knew they could counter her with them and did so, and somewhat broken against players who didn't (since riot generally balances around proper play [in this case using control wards against her], so she had somewhat crazier burst compared to today).\n\nThey since reworked vision and how it interacts with her shroud to make things fairer for both the akali player (no longer hard countered by pinks) and those playing against her (no longer 'forced' to buy pinks just for her and less susceptible to be instaburst).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Mysticman89","date":"2017-10-09T17:46:04.768+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you prepared to deal with akali receiving very significant buffs to compensate for her shroud being gutted? \n\nCurrently a lot of her power budget is in the reliable invisibility, so she can be balanced around that. If she doesn't have that reliability, she'll need a lot more strength elsewhere to remain balanced. What's more, people won't always have pinks(/reds) to counter the shroud, so in many cases she'd just end up super buffed, and still have her shroud, which was the issue with her prior to her change.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Packun Flower","date":"2017-10-09T19:17:10.702+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bruh.. {{item:2055}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2017-10-09T18:16:17.087+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree 100%, just revert the whole rework. Akali was fine the way she was, now she can't even midlane anymore. Her shroud used to be placeable everywhere and would only be revealed by pink wards, now every DoT or AoE ability reveals her. And since they completely gutted her ultimate damage to compensate for the supposed buffs to her shroud (it was actually a nerf though), anyone with DoT or AoE hard counters her shroud, which is the same as countering her.","replies":[]}]}
