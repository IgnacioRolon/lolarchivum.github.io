There is little reason to pick Zac over Sejuani since he will have a weaker early game, and his E engage doesn't really compare to Sejuani's Dash and Ultimate combo, which is not only less risky, but also hits a larger area aswell. It's a shame though that instead of actually nerfing her where she would need it, they'll probably straight nerf Cinderhulk instead. _(Note: For the record, I'm OK if they nerf both.

You can punish Zac a hell of a lot easier than Sejuani, for instance, and he doesn't have stellar clear times either. People don't pick Sejuani for the niche that she fills, they pick her for the all-round consistent jungler that she is. It just so happens that the niche that she was originally designed for is the same role that Zac would normally fill.","replies":[{"poster":"Venowolf","date":"2015-04-12T14:43:57.108+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"With the new Black Cleaver both (Sejuani and Zac) felt down a lot, both are a very bad fighters and the new Black Cleaver give that chance to destroy tanks, so its about time and wait for the tank-meta junglers down a little bit, I'll hope that Zac received some love on tehse days to be more revelant","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Trash MammaI","date":"2015-04-12T13:12:50.610+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think sej is the issue considering she's banned so much and nobody picks zac still lol","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SIayton","date":"2015-04-12T10:55:50.361+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"His damage is weak, his CC is pretty soft, his ganks aren't particularly threatening pre 6, all in all he's just not as good at his job as the other tank initiators.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Support Evelynn","date":"2015-04-12T11:10:16.424+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"He has.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Garurumon","date":"2015-04-12T10:45:03.001+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"You can see exactly where Zac is gonna land during his E. \n\nPros will dodge ever Zac jump unless they are cc'ed before.","replies":[{"poster":"Worst Mid Ever","date":"2015-04-12T10:50:07.107+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"that didn't stop him from being the top jungle pick during season 3, he fell off because the tank meta died and everyone started playing high damage AD fighters","replies":[{"poster":"Garurumon","date":"2015-04-12T11:13:48.352+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Worst Mid Ever,realm=OCE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=kjHzds45,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2015-04-12T10:50:07.107+0000)\n>\n> that didn't stop him from being the top jungle pick during season 3, he fell off because the tank meta died and everyone started playing high damage AD fighters\n\nWell it stopped him from being a successful in high elo.
