Just wondering if Riot knows about this or if others are experiencing similar problems? Don't know if this has something to do with using the New Client? The problem isn't that the settings have been reset once, it's that they continually get reset every time I re-log in the accounts.\r\n\r\nAny help/comments/feedback would be appreciated. Thanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-28T05:41:22.521+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you using any sort of custom modifications to your in-game settings that aren't available in-game?","replies":[{"poster":"Gamers Anonymous","date":"2016-11-29T04:41:40.403+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi, thanks for replying.\n\nI'm not aware of any 'custom modifications', although I don't really understand what you mean by that?\n\nThe only thing I have ever changed outside of any in-game changes has been editing the \"input.ini\" file in the relevant LoL folder, in order to change some key bindings in the past. Does that count? Although I thought the game no longer checks the input.ini file anyway because in-game settings are now all kept server side?? which is why I was thinking this settings resetting problem is a server-side/Riot issue...\n\nAlso, these resets only started happening after I switch to using the New Client beta.\n\nThanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-29T21:40:32.138+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, modifying your input.ini file is precisely what I meant. ^.^\n\nSince the migration to cloud-saved, we still *kinda* check that file, but in a different way now. I believe the reason your settings are continuously reset is because there was something in your input file that was originally uploaded to the servers during the migration. I'd like you to complete a reset of this file to see if anything changes.\n\nFirst, **log into League** then navigate to your config folder, which should be in your install directory:\n\n> **C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config**\n\nDelete these files:\n**- input.ini\n- PersistedSettings.json**\n\nAfter you've deleted these two files, hop into a custom match to confirm your settings are all set to default, then make any changes you want to in-game. Leave the custom and hop into another to confirm the settings weren't reset again. Let me know if this helped!","replies":[{"poster":"MOSESES","date":"2018-01-14T21:54:08.895+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bro or sis ty so much for this help.

One remaining question I have is why is it only happening when I use the New Client? When I switched back to the legacy client I have noticed that my in-game settings revert back to normal and do not continually reset.\n\nThis is why I am continuing to use the legacy client now, and I'm a little afraid to test your solution with the New Client, because I do not want to permanently lose some of my old custom key bindings that cannot be bound in-game.\n\nI feel like if I wait out the beta phase of the New Client then maybe this problem might go away by the time we all automatically switch over to the New Client after the beta ends and all the legacy client files are automatically wiped.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-30T23:03:07.761+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you have custom input settings that were manually edited into the file rather than changed in-game, then it makes complete sense why this is happening. Those manual changes often cause these of issues, which is why we don't recommend making them. It seems one or more of your custom settings is conflicting with the Beta Client and causing the reset.\n\nIf you take the steps above, it will clear out all custom configurations you've made, but it should resolve the constant resets. Alternatively, you can continue to use the Legacy Client for now, if you want to continue using those custom settings. Keep in mind, though, that everyone will eventually have to migrate to the new client once it's finished, so you may have to abandon your custom settings later down the road.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
