Challenger Ahri was first released at the start of the 2015 season, but since she's legacy, it means she'll periodically make her way back to the store, too.","replies":[{"poster":"Ult√Æma","date":"2015-07-18T20:02:53.314+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"And Frozen Ezreal isn't, for some reason, a Chroma Skin.
