Nah, fuck that. But I am serious about wanting people to join this new and growing community. The vision I have for Internal Gaming is a place where gamers can come together and have a good time. What I believe will set I.G. apart from other discords is how friendly and relaxing it will be for everyone to be a part of. Here is a list of some of the stuff we want to do;\r\n\r\nkaraoke nights\r\nanime/movie viewing receptions\r\nlive streams\r\ncoaching\r\ntournaments\r\nparty games (Ex. Jack Box, Cards against humanities).\r\n        \r\n        Another goal for us is to promote streamers who are serious about wanting to grow there channel by hosting their twitch right in the discord (this will be done weekly via name drawing). There are also going to be opportunities to make money for people who are willing to put in the time and dedication into growing the community. If this sounds awesome to you, go ahead and hop on into the discord, become a member, and have a good time!","replies":[]}
