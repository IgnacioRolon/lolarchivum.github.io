After waiting a while an error popped up, at about 60% completion rate. It made the patcher return to 33% and show \"Scanning files\" instead of normal download speed. The progress went up to 40% and the same error showed up again, making the patcher get stuck at 33% again. I tried everything - deleting the folders in LoL directory, using Hextech Repair Tool, using the client repair function. I even restored my system to a point before the patch, but it didn't help aswell. When I removed LoL completely and did a clean reinstall everything went fine. Up to 98%. The same error appeared again and made my game literally unable to patch. Is there any solution to this? I've tried contacting Riot but they just told me to wait, which I already tried doing.\n\nThis is making me really frustrated, please help {{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}}","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-08T17:44:21.917+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's really important not to delete any files unless specified in a guide, as that can end up causing you more problems.  Using the HRT to repair the client was a good move to restore missing files.  At this point in the process, the patcher needs to connect to the patching servers to download files then update them, but is being blocked.  I suggest using our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to make sure your network is strong and able to establish that communication.  This should help, but let me know if your issue persists!","replies":[{"poster":"Fahr3nh3it","date":"2016-10-09T11:42:10.497+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Apparently Riot has fixed it, but it didn't change anything for me. Even though I'm on EUNE I changed to NA so I could download the patch without any problems. It still shows an error at about 46% and goes back to 33%. Closing the error a few times doesn't help. HRT's force repatch tool only makes it go to 99%, where I also get an error. I don't think it might be a connection issue, I've had this since 6.20 was released a few days ago and before that everything was fine. I sent Network info and game logs in a ticket but I didn't get a response yet. What else can I do when even a clean reinstall helps?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cael Prime","date":"2016-10-08T18:29:43.041+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im having the same issue.
