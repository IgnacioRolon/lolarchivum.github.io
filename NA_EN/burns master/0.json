The game is sacrificing its fun and creativity for the sake of competition, even for it&#039;s non-competitive player base. Unique builds and not as popular champs are basically punished for being in the game. Riot&#039;s talented with their designs, and it&#039;s a shame that such cool champs like Aurelion Sol, Kindred, Lissandra, and Mordekaiser are basically nonexistent because they&#039;re either weaker than what&#039;s &quot;meta&quot; or they&#039;re too unbalanced to be on par with anything else because of their kit. It&#039;s sad.\r\n\r\n2. The game is losing individual skill expression, I&#039;ve made threads very similar to this before. It&#039;s usually all about team fights, you can&#039;t even do anything if you&#039;re outnumbered 2-1 unless you&#039;re a fed tank. \r\n\r\n\r\n3. The game itself lacks permanent game modes. \r\n**Unpopular Opinion**\r\nI think Ascension should be a permanent mode, or at least something similar to TDM. \r\n\r\nWhat&#039;re your thoughts?

It felt like a transition from Team Fortress 2 to Call of Duty, where fights that once gave me enough time to devise cool tactics started ending far too abruptly, mainly because everyone started dying too quickly. Comebacks became less likely, and generally it felt like my matches went from this interesting back-and forth to a coinflip, where whoever fell behind effectively turned into a helpless bystander as their team got crushed. After that, I started playing League significantly less.\n\nMore recently, what's been turning me off is what I perceive as a stagnancy in League's design, and Riot repeating a lot of the mistakes they've committed previously. League has a lot of systemic issues that have required urgent attention since its earliest seasons, but these problems have remained unaddressed still. When Riot does announce that they're tackling a problem, their response has tended to miss the mark, often for reasons they should have been able to predict. Runes Reforged, for example, advertized itself as a rework to the rune system, but really was yet another seasonal mastery update with a fresh coat of paint, and as such it has ended up with the exact same core problems as its predecessors. When the Juggernaut Update launched, I loved the intention and freshness of the idea, even if the execution was largely unsuccessful, but by the time the Tank Update came around, I felt like Riot should have seen it coming when their reworks fell flat, as no previous roster update had truly worked. Additionally, several newer champion releases and reworks have felt pretty samey, even when they turn out utterly catastrophic: Zoe in particular quickly became hated among players, and so for reasons that had been pointed out in other parts of the game, such as Nidalee's nuclear spears (i.e. her one-shot Q, arguably an even worse version of the effect), the irritating stun + nuke combo on any burst mage, and any kind of RNG. Her failure was entirely avoidable, yet somehow we still have that champion in the game. It's this refusal to learn from their past mistakes, along with a design philosophy that has become increasingly inconsistent and more focused on generating PR at a particular moment, that has put a damper on my hopes for League's future. I still do believe that League is an awesome game with practically limitless potential, and that there are fantastic people at Riot who are working hard to improve the game, but I'm not entirely sure if those people are being empowered to do the right thing, or what the direction even is for League at this point.","replies":[{"poster":"Burns Master","date":"2018-04-17T05:28:31.142+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"I'm curious as to what you think still hasn't been addressed since early seasons. \nI started smack around the end of season 4, so idk if these problems you speak of were earlier. \n\nAlso, I have no idea why Zoe has so much RNG in her kit, when Riot wanted to remove that kind of chance? \n\nAnd I think league is still a lot of fun, but I'm not going to sugarcoat my gripes with the game.

A lot of players point to those problems as if they were new, but this is something that's been complained about as early as Season 3. No other MOBA has a compositional meta as rigid as League's, and it's led to a lot of problems in the long run: where other games can afford to let the player directly choose a champion to take to their non-ranked match, League needs to have the player choose their role instead, and will on occasion randomly select a different role for them from the one they selected (i.e. Autofill). League therefore doesn't really let the player reliably play with the champion they wanted, which I think is discouraging when one is forced to spend a half hour playing a role or champion one dislikes or is unfamiliar with.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Burns Master,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=T94FN9UX,comment-id=00230000,timestamp=2018-04-17T05:28:31.142+0000)\n> \n> Also, I have no idea why Zoe has so much RNG in her kit, when Riot wanted to remove that kind of chance? \n\nExactly, and this I think is an example of Riot's design philosophy becoming inconsistent over time. For a time, the only real RNG mechanic in League was crit, and Riot fully acknowledged that the random element was unhealthy and should eventually be reworked. Fast-forward to now, and Riot's released this design post on which types of RNG they consider acceptable, at the same time as a new champion (Zoe) and a new rune (Kleptomancy) that both heavily rely on randomness. Both flopped, in large part because their design post was wrong and the RNG baked into both mechanics was considered neither fun nor fair for anyone involved. What's also funny is that the very post written to try to justify RNG actually goes against the RNG in Zoe's kit, since her random outputs are only telegraphed if one assumes that literally every player on the map is directly observing Zoe at all times.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"dangopee","date":"2018-04-17T03:30:42.866+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"Winning a stomp game where the ADC did 80% of my teams damage doesn't feel satisfying at all.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AmenPerson","date":"2018-04-17T22:59:19.902+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The things that have taken the fun out of the game for me are \n\n          •The boards - All this place does it complain about current changes with the game, and don't at all try to be useful.
