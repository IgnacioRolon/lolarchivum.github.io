From there the violin line followed. I spent a while playing with the balance of acoustic vs electronic instruments. There were some iterations where there was too much electronic and while it sounded cool it felt too much like the Project universe vs Piltover.

Both are assassins, but while Jhin uses weaponry like guns that are their own solo thing, Camille uses her own body as a near ageless weapon. While Jhin is artsy and drawn out with preparing his kills, Camille cuts (get it?;)) right to the point. Jhin loves to put on a show and kills three more people than his primary target to fuel his ocd. Camille gets the job done and is no nonsense with her work.\n\nSo the first and last champs of the season are perfect foils to each other.","replies":[{"poster":"Skorch","date":"2016-12-15T22:53:24.888+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Jhin at one time used a sword.","replies":[{"poster":"midnight oil24","date":"2016-12-16T00:46:45.213+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But that's not what he's using now.","replies":[{"poster":"Skorch","date":"2016-12-16T00:50:12.784+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i know, just fun tip that for some reason few people know about","replies":[{"poster":"midnight oil24","date":"2016-12-16T00:59:39.652+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fair enough.
