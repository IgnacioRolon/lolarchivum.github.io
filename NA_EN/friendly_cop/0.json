If you know the seed and the calculation to get the \"Random\" number, you can predict it.\n\nRe-rolls don't make it less Random, as the re-roll is a random selection.

If you play anythin besides a hard engage comb or a poke comb, you have problems as you will face a pokecomb, and with out the potential of outlaneing, splitpush or farming, if you can't keep up with the poke you need atleast malphite levels of hardengage to beat a pokecomb.\n\nBack in the days befor rerolls, aram was way more random. You could have great games with udyr as your enemys probably had similar melees like voli on their team, and poke especially early on was reduced alot by not haveing any aditional manasustain and not enough gold to start with the likes of a tear.","replies":[]},{"poster":"wop","date":"2015-04-15T23:10:43.193+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe it's because a lot more people have certain champs.

I also get Yorick and I see Poppy all the time. The problem is as a human being you have a much different view of \"Random\" than a computer does. A computer picking a random number out of 1-100 might pick 50, 10 times in a row and that is still COMPLETELY \"random\". Also as humans we have a tendancy to have selective memory and forget important flaws or facts because our brain is looking for proof of our theory. Famously there is a dancing spiderman gif that looks like he dances to the beat of literally any song when in reality it's just your brain ignoring all the moves he makes that are completely out of tempo or offbeat.

I'd like the idea of an ARAM that could let you get a champ you never played before or have owned..hmm...better start a thread for that. Personally, I myself find it random and I have the same lucky sprees where I get one champion two or three times but I do get other champions alot and those lucky ones only happen once a week. Also: Most players don't have champs like a Yorick/Diana (I excluded poppy because I always see her) unless they had been interested in them or knew they could be benefitial. The reason you see so many of the same champ is because most players have the 450 champions and a few 1350, and even fewer of anything higher than that, and if you do see a highly priced champion, its usually because that champion is highly talked about in how well they work. Ex: I bought Kat to see if her being op was true (WHICH IT ISNT EITHER THAT OR IM JUST REALLY BAD WHICH IS PROBABLY A HIGH POSSIBILITY)","replies":[]},{"poster":"spavined","date":"2015-04-16T00:13:09.700+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the funny part is all 3 of the champs you mentioned for not seeing i consider op while i consider the others you mentioned seeing every game as good... well except ez he is op lol","replies":[]},{"poster":"test account","date":"2015-04-15T22:55:26.434+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I get yorick all the time in Aram, it's great I just build all defense and ult-bot our best person while mindlessly diving the backline.
