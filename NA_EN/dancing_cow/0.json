Ganking has a very specific play pattern, and farming jungle to carry is just as selfish as a laner who refuses to roam (which most people I ever get matched with struggle with severely). Feral flare has its problems, but just because it is a play style that is unusual in comparison to the norm (ganking) doesn't mean it is entirely bad or wrong. I totally agree that the jungle is about opportunism and being in the best spot at the best time, all I'm saying is that most laners have it in their head that that means always ganking their lane 100% of the time. Junglers may have the best options for ganking, but when it all comes down to it, it is a game based around HAVING FUN.","replies":[]},{"poster":"UncensoredAngel","date":"2014-10-19T11:05:29.485+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"It lets them late game carry","replies":[]},{"poster":"YoungManhatten","date":"2014-10-19T22:27:03.657+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They made this pretty clear at the start of season 4, the whole \"jungler is just a roaming support\" thing has been over, they are junglers who have playstyles of farming and building up towards late game.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Krshna","date":"2014-10-19T03:43:05.406+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"> Says every selfish laner who thinks the Jungler's only job is to gank for them.\n\nIt's not necessarily to gank for them, but it IS to be useful in some way, shape or form.

Only junglers who watch Trick2G and think that everything he says about disrespect and playing to carry and being selfish aren't supposed to be JOKES play like that. If/when I ever build a Feral flare, I still bank when there are good opportunities, I still call Dragon/Baron when it is a good time, I still counter jungle, and I still group and push objectives and team fight. The difference between Flare and other jungle items is that if you play the way it is supposed to be played, then it changes from a game of \"Jungler vs all the other lanes\" into \"Jungler vs other jungler\". Setting back the enemy junglier hard and then carrying does two things: 1 It sets you far ahead to carry. 2 It sets the other jungled far enough behind that even if they try to bank, they cannot be effective because they fall behind so quickly. Flare would be far more efficient at its intended role if they hadn't added a Camp and given everything gold generation passives, because counterjungling relies so heavily on starving the enemy jungler.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Evil Jester","date":"2014-10-19T02:39:05.819+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":3,"body":"1000x this^^^^","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"InsaneSamurai","date":"2014-10-18T23:56:23.514+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":3,"body":"It is?  \nWooooooooooo!\nNo more obviously broken Udyrs?","replies":[{"poster":"missinggrave","date":"2014-10-19T03:39:46.207+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm sorry if I'm more terrified of a Yi that's afk for the first ten minutes than any Udyr that isn't Trick2G","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"UPfreely","date":"2014-10-19T01:44:12.255+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"rip ww","replies":[{"poster":"ShadowNinetails","date":"2014-10-19T03:35:45.694+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Bruh S5 looks like it's going to be VERY good for Wolfie.
