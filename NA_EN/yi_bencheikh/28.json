When have you heard people crying for zed buffs? he still has a 10%+ playrate and is played successfully by his mains.\n{{champion:7}} has a -48% winrate with a -7% playrate, yet no ones doubts that she is strong in the right hands.\n\nLee having a 50% winrate with a freaking 40% playrates is a very good sign that he is in need of some nerfs.
