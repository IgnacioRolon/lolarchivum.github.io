More and more decisions regarding itemization have been in the realm of handing out free damage or free defense on the kinds of items a certain class already has to build in order to do their job at all. In the case of AD Carries, it's free survivability. To top this off, they appear to want to balance champions by introducing clunkiness to their kit rather than stripping extraneous power. Delayed damage on assassins is the most recent application of this.\n\nRiot seems to want a champion to be a closed system where they bring everything they need (or can at least buy what they need). Needing to use teammates is \"unfun\" apparently, despite this being a team game. The only time they relent on this angle is when designing a support, and it's often to the support's detriment as well.","replies":[{"poster":"Ïnsidious","date":"2017-07-04T00:23:38.820+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":3,"body":"Jesus, you guys make it sound like adc's just draintank the entire team, if an adc gets focused, hit by a full mage combo, jumped on by a tank or a melee carry, adc dies.

But now it takes 2 people just to do this. Probably 3 people or 2 fed people to ensure they die asap, or the adc escapes and drain tanks. And they have too much mobility from items too considering basically every tank item only gives initial engage - leaving tanks and bruisers with nothing to catch an adc after they survive the initial engage onto them - which thanks to support items and exhaust and cc they pretty much guaranteed do. And late game? Not a damn chance unless you got 3 people diving and deleting the adc - not likely considering the tendency of teams to pick ranged dps or burst champs. You can't just pop a syndra or ori ult to open the fight then flash on the adc with vi ult or renekton combo and pop them. If you do that - even if you could manage to pull it off - you wouldn't kill the adc, they'd just kite back, and you get deleted by the enemy team while the adc drain tanks. That is the stupidity of how absurdly overtuned adc's are due to nerfs to other classes' damage items and due to survivability of adc's due to support items.\nYou want proof beyond that? If one team has an average adc or slightly sub par adc but their top and mid are amazing... the enemy team has average or sub par top and mid but amazing adc, the adc advantage outweighs the top and mid advantage every time. Last time I checked, 2>1. But not in league; adc>all. This is why people are so damn fed up with adc's and items buffing/protecting adc's. Hell I've skipped out on building {{item:3143}} vs 2 fed crit users on the enemy team because {{item:3109}} made me tankier thanks to bs healing from my adc doing damage. The protection for adc's needs to be cut down massively and some raw damage (ad and ap) stats be given back to items for other classes like mages, assassins, and bruisers or their ability scaling numbers increased (so you get the same effect). After this is properly taken care of, then we can assess which if any adc's are truly in need of nerfs and which ones are only overtuned due to the insane level of survivability given to them by supportive tank, heal, and shield items of which they make better use than any other class of champion.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"lolipopevelynn","date":"2017-07-04T00:01:53.362+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Critmaster Garen,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=wW89q5Qe,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2017-07-03T11:43:21.789+0000)\n>\n> you could have made the same argument for assassins when they didnt have delayed burst.\n> \n> &quot;god, why does {{champion:91}} who built full damage kill me so fast?&quot;\n> \n> \n> then there is the changed marksman itemization.\n> \n> full damage like {{item:3046}} 12% damage reduction, {{item:3072}} 200 health shield and 20% lifesteal, {{item:3026}} armor and a revive passive, {{item:3139}} mr, cleanse and lifesteal or {{item:3812}} 30% damage delay with 15% lifesteal to just drain tank through burst?\n> \n> marksmen arent just building full damage anymore. theyre stacking defense at the same time without losing out in their carry potential.\n> \n> no, theyre not going to have all of those items at the same time, but even just a phantom dancer combined with a death dance on a 3 item build makes a massive difference in survivability without giving anything up for it in the damage departement.\n\nyep, PD needs to be reworked again or losed the 12% dmg reduction.
