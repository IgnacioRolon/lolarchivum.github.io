We did some prototyping on kits for him, that was just using the old SR dragon with its wings removed though (wings removed to make it extra obvious it was something different). It bobbed up and down in a cute, if goofy, way.\n\n* One of Lucian's first prototype kits had an ammo system (like Graves and Jhin now use). The idea showed some promise, it didn't fit as well with the constantly moving, nimble, rapid firing vibe we wanted to hit on for Lucian though, so it got shelved for quite a while.\n\n* Bard's Q at one point was a similar ability to Taliyah's Q (mini Lucian ult with a bit of a rhythm to it). In his case the hits weren't AOE, but if they all landed the target got stunned.\n\n* An early version of Jayce could place Sensor Beacons around the map. They worked kind of like Rek'Sai's tremor Sense, though had a smaller range and limited lifespan. They weren't particularly useful, but were a lot of fun to play around with.\n\n* For the upcoming Rengar rework one of the Bonetooth Necklace versions we tried was a ward that destroyed other wards that were really near it's location (a predatory ward if you will). The idea showed some potential, it was overkill on Rengar though (he doesn't need additional ability to get onto targets unseen).
