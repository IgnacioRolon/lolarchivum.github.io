I guess it's ok, if you rely on your team - you ult and don't get instadeleted, so you can clean up, but your dmg is crap.

His base stats are bad across the the board, and this is especially true of his innate defenses. His HP, Armor, MR, regen, all of these are lux-tier, and stacking defenses isn't a great strategy because of it.\n\nNow, you do get more out of that sort of build than other skirmishers might because of the double crit passive, but Yasuo's base damage is just not great, so you need damage items to scale further into the game, just like an AD carry. Tank builds are bad; that isn't up for debate, but if you want to bruiser-esque, now that's a different story.\n\n{{item:3078}} , {{item:3006}} , {{item:3046}} , and {{item:3812}} make a decent offensive core while still providing survivability. A good thing about Yasuo is that his passive damage steroid allows him to build less damage items than a traditional ADC and still have relevant damage, so you can trade off some, but not all of your late game potential with those 4 items and then still have room for 2 pure tank items. Or, if you want more mixed offense/defense itemization in your build, you thrown in {{item:3053}}.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2016-05-11T16:15:29.254+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think that will just cause headaches for people fighting him.","replies":[]}]}
