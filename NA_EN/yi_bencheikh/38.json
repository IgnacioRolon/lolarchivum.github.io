Especially since Yasuo can max E; it has a 10 seconds cooldown at level 1, 6 when maxed. With that in mind, Yasuo can still use his E to dash on you, trade, and get away without giving you the chance to trade back (similar to Renekton, especially since Yasuo can use his third Q knockup against you when he dashes) Considering the fact that new minion waves come every few seconds, Yasuo still has a lot of dashes to use during the lane phase, and this can get worse with every level.","replies":[{"poster":"CeexSett","date":"2016-08-20T10:05:41.649+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I concur, but hiperbolizing it to the point where it seems completely broken is not the solution.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Papa Slothy","date":"2016-08-20T02:16:24.166+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"although to be fair, if you look at what he could do before he does it and prepare yourself it can turn the trade in your favor.
