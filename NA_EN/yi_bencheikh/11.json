Too many if you ask me.  I would say 1 per player. Just to get the overpicked champions out of the way, like, Wukong, Evelynn, Syndra... etc. I just want one weekend where I can pick my champion.  Of course Riot probably won't do this and will probably just release \"Random\" urf again. But... Hey, we tried.","replies":[{"poster":"SSShutTheDuckUp","date":"2017-03-18T20:00:03.044+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They are a lot for a reason. Power picks are too many, IMO.","replies":[{"poster":"Sedonis","date":"2017-03-19T15:56:24.982+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea but having too many bans will make it so those champs will never appear and if that is the case they may as well just perma ban the champs. I want to play those champs a couple of times if they get through. It is this awkward scenario where 20 bans is way too many and could take forever. The problem arises when you don't have enough bans as well. If you don't have enough bans then you obviously get the op champs every game. 10 bans is probably best.\n\nEDIT: People that for some reason have also never played URF before may want to play the perma ban champs as well. So having 10 is enough to where enough of the super op picks are banned but some of the fun ones get through. 20 could possibly take way too long in the banning phase If you have 20 bans at say an average of 20 seconds each. Then you spend 400 seconds just banning. A little over 6 minutes. Then you add on pick phase which is around 45 seconds then you end up having over 7 minutes in lobby. \n\nAt the same time these numbers will obviously go down as people figure out what they want to play and ban before they even play. This is just on the high end, being almost dramatic really.","replies":[{"poster":"SSShutTheDuckUp","date":"2017-03-19T19:29:40.777+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was over-exaggerating because seeing the same 15 OP champions every game pretty much ruined the mode for me to the point I would rather not see them at all. And given the salt in the boards I was not the only one. Rito tried some bandage aid solutions and they helped, but facing a good _insert any of the OP in the mode_ was still a \"you will have no fun this time\". There were a lot of suggestions, as well as the AR URF which was pretty good actually. It is sad, but if the opportunity is given players will still play the same OP stuff every game, and it already got stale.\n\nAbout the time spent in lobby I already stated what a solution would be.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"franchise7676","date":"2017-03-18T18:02:11.347+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Awesomeasf ck,realm=EUW,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=uq0l05Vx,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-03-18T18:00:31.116+0000)\n>\n> Maybe, with something like 2-3 bans per player (20-30 in total).
