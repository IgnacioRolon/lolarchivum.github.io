My ping and FPS stayed at their normal range (60) but I would randomly stop in place for about 10 seconds or just lose control of my character. Typing in chat, recalling and pinging would have a 10+ second delay, all of this with my ping and FPS staying normal. Anyone else with this issue recently?  Any solution for this?  I already reset my router and other games work fine.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-22T01:40:32.921+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This almost perfectly describes something known as packet loss.
