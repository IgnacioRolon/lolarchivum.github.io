It&#039;s not me, why should I care?\n\nThen I played one game where someone in post-lobby that was an actual new player said to me, &quot;why do you enjoy stomping people who just want to learn...&quot;\n\nI don&#039;t. I didn&#039;t really think about it. Just wanted to level up another account to one-trick on.

I think if you go on YouTube you can find people being just as nasty on other games. Thing is, it's usually competitive games. Not co OP, or semi-dead casual shit like starcraft. Hell even Awesomenauts, a pretty unpopular game, has some very insulting players. I think it's because it's that MOBA style, competitiveness. I dont play very many games so I dont have any other real personal experiences with toxicity.. but I have seen it on YouTube with other games like overwatch. My personal experience in League is very mild. I rarely pay attention to chat interactions between strangers, and I rarely get flamed myself. So idk. I guess I just disagree that league is so much worse than other games. Also, who told you league has no toxicity problems? Lol. The honor system fixed everything? I highly doubt anyone has ever said that to you.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Zertryx","date":"2018-08-16T06:45:38.163+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":2,"body":"Ok i know i'm gonna be in the minority with what about to say, but please at least take the time to read and consider my statements here before jumping on any bandwagons and dismissing me.\n\nFor starters, Toxicity will ALWAYS be a problem in gaming, sure we can add and implement systems to fight it off but no matter how hard you try there will always be toxic people, and the BIGGER  community is, the more you are going see. Because just like in games, in real life we have punishment systems in place and we still have toxic people IRL too. it just aint ever gonna go away.\n\nWhile yes, there are things we can do to fight it and try to minimize it as much as possible, but the only TRUE way to really get rid of toxicity would be to delete the chat (or since we can't MUTE the player) Now i know you said that \"muting\" only hides the problem BUT actually it really does more than this. Hear me out for a second, Muting does a few things here. 1: it makes it so you are no longer exposing yourself to the harmful words of the other player, you already know they are a jerk so now you no longer have to see it. This is good because 2: It also prevents you from caving in and FEEDING him or her the Attention they are ultimately seeking. Weather you are being toxic back when you respond to players like this it just gives them more fuel to keep talking and to keep responding. you already know they are toxic, and by edging them on you are now part of the inherit issue, instead ignore them, and at end game ask for people to report. typing in all chat and during a game and talking to them is ALSO being toxic, because now your making the situation more involved and bringing not only your game play down but also morale down as well and thats not good.\n\nHonestly i always felt riot should have made a option in game to turn off chat completely, we now have Emotes / Pings to communicate well enough with players that we DONT NEED chat function, which is where MOST of the toxic behavior happens, (why do you think games like hearthstone dont have \"Toxic\" players being complained about 24/7?) The Chat is the real demon, when you give players a way to aggressive channel their frustration onto other players, and human nature is immediately to DEFEND themselves, you now have a chat full of players constantly bickering, at this point who ever started it no longer matters, you both get punished.\n\nIt may sound like a cop out but honestly the TRUEST way to battle toxic players is to honestly ACTUALLY ignore them, the more you shine a light on something the more its gonna start appearing frequently and MOST people when they start being rude or angry are legit trying to get a reaction from you, if you dont give the reaction they no longer have anything to talk about and if all 9 other players ignore them ... then they just talk to themselves ... and the other 9 players live in peace.\n\nFor your next experiment, try muting EVERYONE start of the game, for a multitude of games and use pings / emotes to communicate and watch as your skill and FUN levels improve, once u gain control of how YOU respond to toxic people by a INSTANT mute rather than \"Typing\" back you realize that the games 10000x more fun when you use the mute / hide the chat","replies":[{"poster":"ScyPhan790","date":"2018-08-16T11:14:57.214+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with this wholeheartedly.\nThe only thing that I want to nitpick with Riot is that there is no way to \"mute/disable\" the \"Alt #\" emotes/animations. Sure you can mute pings and emotes in the score screen, but that doesn't stop people from spamming Alt4 and audibly laughing at you in game. You could lower in-game audio, but then that prevents you from hearing actual helpful pings, and even then you can still see the animations go off as they taunt you. Or I think you can lower champ voice audio, but you can still see the animations, and for someone like me I enjoy listening to the voices of some champs.

Do you know how frustrating it is to constantly be flamed and given no actual advice when you're new and trying to learn even when you explain that you're new? If it wasn't for my friend, I would have quit before I even learned how to play. I was lucky. I had someone to help me get better and keep me trying. Not all new players have that though.","replies":[{"poster":"Ripikou","date":"2018-08-17T01:45:55.230+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's pretty easy to ignore text.

As a matter of fact most of them end up spam pinging baron.\n\nPeople not pinging missing in low elo i can understand but pinging to get something isn't something you forget.","replies":[{"poster":"theChibiTina","date":"2018-08-17T12:16:02.125+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You haven't been part of the conversation until now so you probably didn't go back through, but it was already mentioned and on topic about new players not knowing the mute function exists and henceforth thinking ignoring chat is their only option.

Low elo being exactly where new players are and are trying to learn. So they kinda need the heads up for objectives.","replies":[{"poster":"Jerry SeinfeId","date":"2018-08-17T12:44:33.709+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=theChibiTina,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=dk3PAdQj,comment-id=000600000001000000000000,timestamp=2018-08-17T12:16:02.125+0000)\n>\n> You haven&#x27;t been part of the conversation until now so you probably didn&#x27;t go back through, \n\nMy first comment on this thread/a response is on the 2nd page, 3 of them even. The fuck have i not been part of this conversation? But fair enough i went back and reread all of your comments.\n\n> but it was already mentioned and on topic about new players not knowing the mute function exists and henceforth thinking ignoring chat is their only option. \n\nYOU didn't know where it was. That doesn't mean noone does. The other guy mentionned that new players should play bots until they can beat them with ease. I went into PVP as soon as the game allowed me, with lvl 30s half the time, so i guess i played this game all wrong cuz he said so.\n\n\n> In low elo, people seem to forget that the ping system exists or just forget what it&#x27;s actual intended purpose is and henceforth just type things in chat or just go to an objective and expect people to blindly follow when they were given no warning. \n\nTell me which low elo that is then because where i'm playing these people atleast know what pings mean. The only thing i see happening alot when it comes to pings is people forgetting to call missing, but they ain't typing it either.\nHow do you not notice the difference between a ? spam when someone just died and 2 or 3 ?'s on a lane where noone died.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
