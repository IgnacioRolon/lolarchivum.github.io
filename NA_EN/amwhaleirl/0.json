These are the patch notes.\nv5.18\nSated’s Phantom Hit takes longer to apply for ranged champions.\n\nThough popularly known as the go-to item for Xin Zhao’s and Shyvana’s looking to melt faces, Devourer (and its Sated evolution) systematically skew harder towards ranged champions like Vayne and Kayle when it comes to raw power, safety, and availability of on-hits. While ‘Ranged Sated Junglers’ might be an outlier at present, but we’re taking action towards actively balancing the item for ranged users while we evaluate how best to support them on an champion-specific level if necessary.\n\nPHANTOM HIT FOR RANGED CHAMPIONS : [every 2nd hit] ⇒ every 4th hit\nPHANTOM HIT FOR MELEE CHAMPIONS : unchanged\n\nv5.13\nNo longer scales infinitely. Now gains stacks on takedowns (kills and assists) and eventually transforms. Also, Ghost Dog.\n\n    \"Ah, Devourer. A remnant of that one time we did the fastest design u-turn in the history of League of Legends development (a trophy potentially shared with Season 3's Black Cleaver).\n\n    It appears we have returned to the fight.\n\n    Let's start with the current Devourer and its infinite stacking. Initially, our assumption was that y'all were really invested in the concept of infinite stacking (and infinite power!!!), but as we've tried to iterate around this ‘must have' mechanic, we've come to realize it just doesn't jive well in a PvP game. Either you're stuck in that Always Be Farming mentality, or you're so far behind the enemy jungler that you regret many of the decisions that brought you there in the first place. Nobody likes lagging behind in the stack marathon.\n\n    So some goals: first, since this enchantment has always been the \"I want to farm the jungle\" pickup, we decided to keep the transformation-via-blood-of-my-enemies while taming that Always Be Farming mentality. A hard cap means if you're behind in the Devourer race, you're not just perpetually behind the curve - you can double down your farming efforts to catch up. Additionally, once that transformation does take place, you're not just daydreaming about your next meal - you're sated and ready to rumble.\n\n    Second, we've also updated the way this thing builds stacks in the first place. A simple change is that Devourer builds on monster takedowns (assists or kills), rather than just kills, so you don't feel bad when you give away that blue buff, or when Kallista secures the Dragon with a mega-Rend. Also, speaking of Dragon, we're really trying to incentivize Devourer junglers to focus on contested jungle objectives, like the Rift Scuttler or Dragon, as it gets them out into the sunlight (can't be playing League all day) while also giving enemies clear ways to slow your Devouring roll.\n\n    Third: for that Sated Devourer on-hit buff, we were going for some natural synergy with Devourer's on-hit damage, but are very aware of the potential craziness that can come from it. Things like Blade of the Ruined King's passive proc, or Master Yi's Wuju Style come to mind, but we're hoping you can exercise some real creativity in this space.\n\n    Go forth.\n\n    Devour.\" \n\n    General\n        STARTING ON HIT MAGIC DAMAGE : 25 ⇒ 30\n        LARGE MONSTERS : 1 stack per kill ⇒ 1 stack per takedown (kill or assist)\n        EPIC MONSTERS : 1 stack per kill ⇒ 5 stacks per takedown\n        CHAMPIONS : 2 stacks per takedown ⇒ 1 stack per takedown\n        RIFT SCUTTLER : 1 stack per kill ⇒ 2 stacks per takedown\n        [NEW] GHOST DOG : While stacking your Devourer, you are accompanied by a Ghost Dog who will grow with stacks\n        [NEW] WE'RE GONNA COMBINE : At 30 stacks, Ghost Dog merges with the wielder and the Devourer transforms into...\n    Stalker's Blade - Bloodrazor.png Sated Devourer\n        I HUNGER : Takedowns no longer grow Devourer's damage\n        PHANTOM HIT : Every other basic attack triggers on-hits twice","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Tundra Hunter","date":"2018-04-17T01:34:31.691+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"? \nI feel like a jungler ganking 24/7 IS sacrificing exp, unless he actually gets kills / assists. \n\nIt happens a lot in low elo, jungler just farming free kills on lanes because players over-extend, don't ward, etc. But in higher elo, as a jungler, you can't do that, and a failed gank is punished as you get behind in gold and exp.","replies":[{"poster":"Bob the Toastr","date":"2018-04-17T03:37:59.152+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Catchup exp makes it so a jungler who ganks 24/7 just has to take a few to be equal in level with at least the botlaners, though not necessarily the solo laners, where a jungler who powerfarms will usually only be about 1 level ahead.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"saltran","date":"2018-04-16T18:43:27.058+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":2,"body":"That would be one of the healthier nerfs botlane can get.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2018-04-17T01:28:52.117+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well I think they're making shutdown gold to to the killer rather than the whole team.","replies":[]},{"poster":"HaIlMonitor","date":"2018-04-17T00:49:52.972+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"If they remove catchup xp fully they better give junglers Devour back so they can just afk farm like everyone else and hard carry 20 minutes in.","replies":[{"poster":"3TWarrior","date":"2018-04-17T01:00:35.969+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"or just give the junglers some gold or stat taps so they can exist in other lane positions as well as help out from the jungle position","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DunkmasterDennis","date":"2018-04-17T12:48:27.425+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Catchup XP is needed, because what if someone is forced to AFK due to connection issues, and reconnects to find themselves 10 levels behind?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kyunsei","date":"2018-04-16T19:47:41.496+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=TS Media,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=gdzOBgma,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2018-04-16T18:16:18.623+0000)\n>\n> I hope they&#x27;re reducing ambient gold, global gold and catchup exp as well.\n\nThis ^","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"FrostQueensPlane","date":"2018-04-16T16:31:30.824+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":7,"body":"I thought repetoir already back peddled like the meddler that he is on this idea because it was retarded\n\nOr was it meddler who back peddled like the repetoir that he is\n\nIn either case they don't have anything, their idea of bot lane changes is to buff varus and make it so mages can't leave lane until 20 mins so bot lane can jerk each other off","replies":[{"poster":"ZJD123","date":"2018-04-16T18:43:22.497+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":5,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=FrostQueensPlane,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=gdzOBgma,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2018-04-16T16:31:30.824+0000)\n>\n> I thought repetoir already back peddled like the meddler that he is on this idea because it was retarded\n> \n> Or was it meddler who back peddled like the repetoir that he is\n> \n> In either case they don&#x27;t have anything, their idea of bot lane changes is to buff varus and make it so mages can&#x27;t leave lane until 20 mins so bot lane can jerk each other off\n\nHope this gets upvoted. \n\nYes it was indeed meddler who hyper-backpedaled the upcoming \"8.10 changes\" in his Q/A which were initially presented by RiotRepertoir a few months ago. \n\nHere is the screenshot of what he said: https://imgur.com/a/y1xT5\n\nWhat was presented by RiotRepertoir as a massive project which would lead to bot lane opening up to other roles, marksmen no longer being required in every game, and bot lane powercurves being looked at, is now reduced to \"likely a few item changes\" LUL.

Compared to Janna and Lulu's shields hers is: weaker, doesn't land instantly (the opponents have a window to burst before the other 2/3 of the shield effect lands), and if you or your ADC gets knocked aside or forced to dodge by an enemy attack it's effectiveness drops to the 33% of the shield you got on the first proc.\nJanna and Lulu's shields are stronger, more reliable, and less counter-playable. If we're looking at only the pair's shields, then yes shields are too strong. But the problem isn't all shields. It's Janna and Lulu.\nJanna has ranged from strong to OP for a long time. I think it's because of the perception that she's supposed to be passive that makes her hard for Riot to balance. Make her just strong enough to achieve 50% WR when used properly, and she'll actually register a much lower WR than that because players like to play her passively.\nI think we could have done without the buff to Ancient Coin. If there were Ancient Coin users that were underpowered (i'm not aware of any), then they should have been adjusted directly. All buffing Ancient Coin did was bump Janna's already high WR up by 1.6%.\n\nBut i've digressed way too far. So let me simply add that it is my opinion that shields are not the primary reason bot lane is strong, nor should they be nerfed for that reason even if they were. IMO botlane is exactly as strong as it should be, and i'll change my opinion when I see stats that actually prove their combined sway over the game is stronger than the 40% that the presence of 40% of the team in the lane justifies.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Glory ln Death","date":"2018-04-16T19:38:56.422+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"> What was presented by RiotRepertoir as a massive project which would lead to bot lane opening up to other roles, marksmen no longer being required in every game, and bot lane powercurves being looked at, is now reduced to \"likely a few item changes\" LUL.\n\nWhat was actually said (paraphrased) in the conversation you screenshotted:\n\n* Player: \"What about the marksman stuff Repertoire talked about for 8.8?\"\n\n* Meddler: \"What marksman changes are you referring to?\"\n\n* Player: \"Repertoire mentioned **some marksman itemization changes** in preparation for the bot lane open up.\"\n\n* Meddler: \"Oh, yeah, there will be some of those **marksman itemization changes** in 8.10.\"\n\nWhere, exactly, did the player ask about opening up the bot lane or the work being done to get mages into bot?
