It worked great until about level 4 when she just gave up. Sat back just out of range, used her kunai to farm, threw down smoke any time I came too close. I liked the smoke at first because it seems interesting, but 15 minutes of absolutely nothing happening was boring beyond belief. Between her ability to hide in the smoke (which lasts forever) and the heal off her kunai she&#039;s unmovable unless you can get some sort of burst on her.

So now we have systemic favoring of assassins, while other classes balance points, and power fantasies are effectively ignored by assassins, and what should be their counters or opposites in tanks and defensive supports are rarely played, and in a quite nerfed state.

I wonder ~~ globally nerf damage across the board, maybe add some counterplay to assassins, perhaps, just maybe, buff defense, give actual health, armor/magic resists, etc from Resolve over tenacity/ms/sustain/AD/AP/damage, maybe give back the several thousands of gold worth of stats and active/passive effects taken from tank items over the last few year?  Maybe add in some tank items to replace the ones removed?  Something to deal with all the true damage everywhere all the time forever?  %HP damage mitigation when? ~~  . . . Nah, I got nothing.

And since you always had the advantage, she chose to play it safe and not die. What counterplay you want in this case? To constantly kill her so that she can't even be in a lane if you so much as chose to Flash + stun combo her to death?\n\nI don't think you know what counterplay means in this case.\n_**Counterplay =/= counterpicked**_\nNo champion should feel like they've lost the lane from champ select. That would've been her game if she didn't have a valid way to deal with you, without actually having to beat you with brute force when she clearly couldn't. At least, not that early into the game.\n\nShe was being bullied by you so she had an option to make sure she doesn't die if she can't get a kill. That sounds like a valid option to me, instead to opt for gameplay that revolves around absolutely decimating your lane opponent or failing once and not even being a factor in the game. If that interaction sounds boring to you (because it's not a clusterfuck at mid), you could've ulted on some other lanes and chosen to roam and make a difference there while leaving Akali to her own devices.\n\nFurthermore, her AoE waveclear is her Q and it has to be leveled or filled with AP first. She can't CS properly either so her smokescreen safety net isn't a completely foolproof option to be sitting under a turret and taking no damage from poke. I've played Akali, i know her weaknesses. The way you describe them is basically you not taking an advantage of her passive gameplay and influencing other lanes because you likely wanted to prove that you were better by getting kills.\n\nHer passive is also negated by your own, which means that if you rotate your spells, you can potentially block 2-3 passive applications from her, severely cutting down on her poke damage. You weren't an easy matchup for her and she had an option to deal with it instead of having to concede her own lane that early.","replies":[{"poster":"Elewd","date":"2018-08-02T21:29:01.684+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"just wanted to upvote this, its exactly what i ws thinking, a lane bully is upset he didnt get to just farm kills on someone and then just complained all game most likely, while akali safely farmed up passivly knowing she'll still be useful lategame compared to panth that falls off harder than a brick","replies":[]},{"poster":"VexingRaven","date":"2018-08-03T04:48:15.585+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think this post is pretty indicative of where League has gone lately.

Kunai doesn't have a massive range and smoke has like a 15 second cool down. If she's walking into Kunai range to farm when her smoke is down you should be able to get off some ez pz punishment. If she's not walking into Kunai range to farm when her smoke is down she's falling behind massively so long as you farm properly -- which will eventually mean smoke or not you can go in for the 1v1. Akali definitely has issues, but in this case it sounds like you just didn't punish right.\n\nAlso Akali is super squishy. The heal on Kunai isn't exactly massive, especially in early laning, and so long as you pressure her (which Pantheon's Q should allow) I don't see how you could struggle against it.\n\nEDIT: Her push power is also fairly item reliant. Her q takes a massive amount of energy so it can't be spammed, and up until you get like Gunblade + Sorc Boots you can't clear casters with one cast. If you shove her to turret and then roam/ult/tele somewhere you should have plenty of time to get back before she starts beating on your turret.

Just based on that, {{champion:115}}/{{champion:134}}/{{champion:101}}/{{champion:85}} and {{champion:163}} would give her problems.  The only thing about her shroud that concerns me is if the reveal duration when she attacks out of it is too short for a tower to retaliate.","replies":[{"poster":"IP Masquerena","date":"2018-08-03T10:04:57.398+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"The duration is long enough for a tower to attack her.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"VoraciousX","date":"2018-08-03T04:41:23.983+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You picked Pantheon mid. You absolutely require a target to hit anyone as Pantheon, there's no counterplay to a Pantheon W either outside of \"be out of his range\" or \"be in stealth\". Akali has that advantage vs Pantheon, so of course you might find it unfun as Pantheon to fight her. But her shroud does have counterplay. It's called the shimmer effect you get when you hit her with an ability. You also could have just used your E in random spaces to damage her. She's not immune to damage in the shroud. Maybe you should have actually picked a mage mid lane so that you could hit her in her shroud. Also her shroud has around an 17 second window so you also had 17 seconds after she used it to get her. Saying that Akali's shroud has no counterplay because you used the worst possible scenario when playing against her does not mean anything. If I'd used Teemo and hid in a bush and you came after me but didn't know my exact location, it'd be the same exact thing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nut on my Butt","date":"2018-08-03T00:11:44.041+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"That is, completely your fault for not exploiting the 17 second cd it has in lane, which doesn't even start until the shroud disappears btw. If she's staying out of range then that means she's not pushing or farming, which means you have lane priority and are free to roam.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wimbledofy","date":"2018-08-02T23:28:17.398+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"The only reason you can even complain about akali's lack of counterplay is because your champ has 0 counterplay.
