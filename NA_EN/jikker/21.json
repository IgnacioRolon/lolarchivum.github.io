Holiday Baking Thread!","subforum":"General Discussion","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"Holiday baking starts today!  By far my favourite part of the season.  Once all the shopping and decorating and trips to the dreaded post office are done, I get to spend some time experimenting in the kitchen.  I&#039;m making lots of cookies (sugar cookies, russian teacakes, peppermint balls), cranberry muffins, and trying to also make some homemade donuts this year.\r\n\r\nAnybody got recipes they love to make this time of year?  Who else is starting to bake for the holiday season?  Got any fun memories to share?\r\n\r\nhttp://www.jennycancook.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/SugarCookies2_6885-copy.jpg","replies":[]}
