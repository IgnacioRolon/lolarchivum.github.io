All the League downtime due to toaster fits is starting to annoy.  Problem is, I have quite a tiny budget -- $300-$500 max, prefer under $400 though.  Any chance I can get a semi-decent game laptop for that?   Highest end game I would want to run on it at this time is Dark Souls or Skyrim level so not super powerful but good.  I&#039;m gonna have access to a super gamer desktop in a year so it doesn&#039;t have to be top of the line (and can&#039;t be with price range).  Where should I start looking and for what hardware should I look for?  What min requirements do I want for a slowish to mid-grade gamer set-up?  \r\n\r\nYou&#039;re my experts GD.","replies":[]}
