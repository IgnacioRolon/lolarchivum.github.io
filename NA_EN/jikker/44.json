Took just over a month and was frustrating and interesting at the same time.  I played only Jax except for one game he was banned and one where the enemy picked him.  Got a 2.19 KDA with a 65% winrate, mostly playing top bruiser splitpush.  Got a few triples and a quadra in my second game with him!  Sadly no pentas.  Support mains don't get those lol.  But hey, I can now jungle with him and actually not completely suck =P**\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/RpB4FrP.jpg[img]\n\n**Over: Soulforged has chosen Jax for me.  Ironically he was the first champion I played since I skipped the tutorial.  Time to learn the champ =)\n**\nSeason is almost over so while I wait out the clown fiesta that will be preseason, I&#039;ve decided to do one of these &quot;choose my champion&quot; threads as inspired by My ADC Abuses Me (aka Qwinning).  And yes, outside of bot matches for first win on short of time days and featured game modes or ARAMs with friends, I will play **ONLY** what you select (goodness help me).\n\nSo first poster to roll a number that ends in  **77** will choose one of the following options\n\n1) A mastery level 5 champion to get to level 7 mastery or level 4 champion to get level 6\n\n2) A champion below rank 4 to reach level 5 mastery\n\nMy champions are as follows\n\nRank 6-7 (disqualified)\n{{champion:25}} {{champion:201}} {{champion:89}} \n\nRank 5 (option 1 contenders)\n{{champion:81}} {{champion:412}} {{champion:143}} {{champion:16}} {{champion:267}} {{champion:86}} \n\nRank 4 (option 1 contenders)\n{{champion:37}} {{champion:40}} {{champion:58}} \n\nRank 3 and under (option 2 contenders)\n{{champion:266}} {{champion:103}} {{champion:12}} {{champion:32}} {{champion:1}} {{champion:22}} {{champion:53}} {{champion:51}} {{champion:31}} {{champion:42}} {{champion:131}} {{champion:36}} {{champion:245}} {{champion:60}} {{champion:41}} {{champion:24}} {{champion:222}} {{champion:43}} {{champion:55}} {{champion:10}} {{champion:7}} {{champion:236}} {{champion:117}} {{champion:99}} {{champion:54}} {{champion:11}} {{champion:75}} {{champion:76}} {{champion:20}} {{champion:78}} {{champion:133}} {{champion:33}} {{champion:13}} {{champion:98}} {{champion:102}} {{champion:27}} {{champion:15}} {{champion:134}} {{champion:91}} {{champion:44}} {{champion:18}} {{champion:23}} {{champion:77}} {{champion:6}} {{champion:110}} {{champion:67}} {{champion:254}} {{champion:8}} {{champion:19}} {{champion:5}} {{champion:83}} {{champion:154}} {{champion:238}} {{champion:26}} \n\nI do have the goal of getting all champs to level 5 mastery and I&#039;m off to a slow start which is why I decided to do one of these threads.  So who&#039;s ready to make my preseason more interesting?\n\n&gt; How to roll:\n&gt; \n&gt; You must have FEK to roll which can be downloaded from the thread in Miscellaneous.  Once you have FEK, simply type the command (without spaces) [ roll ] and a random number will be generated.  Example: [roll] If that number ends in 77, you win.  If not, you can roll again with another post, but you must wait a few minutes so as not to spam up the thread.\n\nEDIT: Rofl I won my own thread\n\n**_REMINDER: YOU MAY ONLY PICK FROM MY CHAMP POOL!  So no Karthus, no Shaco._**  Riot gave me enough random champs to make it fun don't worry","replies":[]}
