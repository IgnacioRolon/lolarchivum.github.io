She has one smaller wing near her upper back, that she keeps curled around her neck like a collar. So if we base this on Kayle's full archangel look, we ALSO see Kayle has two smaller wings near her upper back, her largest wings near her mid-back, and slightly smaller wings hear her lower back, or the \"butt wings.\" Morgana is missing her largest wings and one of her smaller wings, which would lead me to believe that is how she's a fallen angel - she can no longer fly because she's been deformed by something.","replies":[{"poster":"GreenLore","date":"2019-02-18T19:00:29.955+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually it looks to me like Morgana doesn't have 3 wings, but 3 set of wings.\n\nShe has 2 small wings around her neck(forming her collar), her 2 butt wings and then there seem to be 2 wings below that.\n\nThese last 2 wings are a bit hard to see,but look at the first image in the opening post and you'll notice that her skirt seems to drag two \"tails\" that are covered in the same black feathers as her other wings behind her.\nI believe that these \"tails\" are actually another set of wings as Kayle also has 2 tail-like wings in her splash art\nhttps://i.ibb.co/L8nVjrf/23e893d1ee096a2e5734e8aebbb8700fdbd96098cb4d759c290cda9258002f79.png\n\nIn this splash art you can even see that Morgana has 2 sets of big wings,even though her neck-wings seem to be missing(maybe they can fold into a smaller collar?)","replies":[]},{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2019-02-19T20:06:33.548+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> she can no longer fly because she's been deformed by something.\n\nHer Bio says she herself chose to bind her own wings.","replies":[{"poster":"Oleandervine","date":"2019-02-19T20:07:30.873+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=DeathBurs7,realm=EUW,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=a8mEAw3A,comment-id=000200000002,timestamp=2019-02-19T20:06:33.548+0000)\n>\n> Her Bio says she herself chose to bind her own wings.\n\nYes, but I posted that yesterday... before the bio was announced...","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2019-02-18T17:47:04.133+0000","up_votes":23,"down_votes":2,"body":"Maybe she just lost the four upper wings?","replies":[{"poster":"DrCyanide","date":"2019-02-18T17:48:32.244+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think that's it, because if you're giving 6 wings enough room to move then the bottom wings would be pushed pretty far down the back, resting on your bottom.","replies":[{"poster":"Jikker","date":"2019-02-18T17:53:50.353+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"I hope that they explain in lore because it doesn't seem like she's a \"fallen\" angel anymore -- two sisters from the aspect of justice that only the guilty have to fear.

Their lore is based on this - Morgana chose to use dark magic to try to win the war their people were waging against their enemies, but Kayle's disgust and hatred for dark magic caused her to disown her sister and turn the fight against her, despite the fact that Morgana had good intentions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cetri","date":"2019-02-18T17:58:50.203+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think there will be an attempt to justify it in-lore, given their conversation about Kayle flying vs. Morgana walking and all the talk about Morgana \"binding\" herself.","replies":[{"poster":"Jikker","date":"2019-02-18T18:10:12.773+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe she \"bound\" herself to Runeterra and that caused her to lose her flight abilities?
