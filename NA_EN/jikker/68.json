What&#039;s that?  You&#039;d think supports would be excited for a new champ?  Just bare with me for a second while I explain to non-support mains out there why this is a bittersweet release, at least to me.\r\n\r\nFirst and foremost we all know that outside of junglers, supports usually get the most hate in the game.  We went through a spell where supports could &quot;do no wrong&quot;, but the days of that are passing and this release will just bring back even more hate probably.  \r\n\r\nXayah and Rakan are two new champs that are an ADC and support respectively.  Xayah has a lot of cool elements to her kit that will make her enticing to ADCs to pick up to play and/or main.  Her whole feather ability with trapping mechanics, the mechanical intensity to master, her attitude as a &quot;rebel&quot;, and admit it guys, you&#039;re probably at least a bit turned on by her appearance, demeanor, and/or voice over.  A lot of people are going to start playing her which puts support mains in a difficult situation.  If you haven&#039;t read it already, Rakan is her &quot;lover&quot; support champion; he gets benefits as does she for playing in the same game including (if I&#039;m reading and looking at it correctly -- feel free to correct if I&#039;m wrong) a near instant recall if one jumps to the other that is already recalling.  If you have an ADC Xayah and don&#039;t have Rakan with her.....or vice versa......you are a bit handicapped.\r\n\r\nWhat I&#039;m seeing happen is this -- supports are going to be forced into learning Rakan, even if he doesn&#039;t appeal to them, and playing him whenever they get a Xayah ADC.  If they don&#039;t, those ADC players who have switched from their former main Vayne to the new mechanics challenge Xayah will probably rage, afk, troll, whatever.....a huge chance for toxicity.\r\n\r\nAnd don&#039;t get me wrong.  The exact opposite can and probably will happen to ADC players!  Supports are usually more understanding and less toxic on average, but that doesn&#039;t mean you won&#039;t get the one off &quot;OMG I&#039;m playing Rakan and you don&#039;t own Xayah?  Stupid ADC I&#039;m supporting mid instead.&quot;  ADCs are gonna have to learn her as well or else risk not gaining the benefits.\r\n\r\nLong story short, what Riot did here is a fun concept -- champions that are tied together by more than small events or dialogue (such as Rengar and Kha&#039;Zix).  When two friends form a bot lane duo, these are two champs tied together in lore that they can play together for added benefits.  And their designs and kits are pretty awesome too.  However, in a game composed of a lot of single players with a large pool of champions, having two that gain a lot by being together is just a recipe for disaster.  None of my predictions may come true, but it&#039;s a valid concern I have with this concept and release.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m curious what other support, or ADC, mains have to think about this.  Yes, we&#039;re finally getting a new champion, but at what cost?  Is having two champions tied together with noticeable ingame benefits a good or bad thing?","replies":[]}
