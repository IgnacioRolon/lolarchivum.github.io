Was playing Garen.  I beat her in lane, killed her twice even although she just hugged her turret and tried to farm, then suddenly she does 2k true damage to me with her ult as I hug walls trying to avoid her triggering vitals but she just hits through me to the vitals despite it being flat against a wall.  One time she literally autoattacked me on my left side as my right was against a wall and it triggered the vital on the right side healing her to full.  It makes no sense.  What else can I do when she melts a tank faster than a Vayne and gets back 180 health per hit?","replies":[]}
