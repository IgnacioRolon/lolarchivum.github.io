Darius has also surpassed Skarner (this may be because of the 80% Skarner banrate)\n\n- Of the Juggernauts, Darius is the most picked followed by Garen\n\n- Darius is 65.78% pick/ban with a 54.40% winrate\n\n- Garen is 76.7% pick/ban with 54.87% winrate\n\n- Skarner is 84.58% pick/ban with 53.48% winrate\n\n- Morde is 65.91% pick/ban with 49.88% winrate\n\n- Fiora is 48.81% pick/ban with 53.73% winrate\n\nMeanwhile GD is complaining about \"Super buffed broken\" Lux who has 10.06% pick/ban rate with 51.02% winrate which for a champ of that low pickrate is quite average.\n\nLet&#039;s get priorities straight people","replies":[]}
