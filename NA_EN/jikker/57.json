How they can expect me to complete online training courses with no internet, I have no clue, but I have managed to snag a mobile hotspot to try to satisfy my greater internet needs.\r\n\r\nHere&#039;s where I need the spot of help -- how much data should I pick up?  I plan to use it for e-mail, streaming stuff like LCS and watching YouTube for a few hours in the evening, Skype/Curse, and hopefully League for like an hour or so a night.  Does anyone know how much data each requires?  I haven&#039;t found a definitive answer, especially to League.  The guy at the store told me 3 GB would be enough, but that sounds like so very little.  Anyone got experience with this or know how much data per month I might need?","replies":[]}
