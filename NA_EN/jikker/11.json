I mean, who was asking for a Katarina buff?  Why is Rumble suddenly being changed or Urgot for that matter?  Why the GP changes to silver serpents if you&#039;re just gonna balance around it?  Why nerf Ezreal&#039;s ult that isn&#039;t his main damage as AD or main problem especially when people like Lux who can nuke people twice in extended late game teamfights are untouched?  Why nerf Malphite who is one of the good counters to this new AD meta with the release of the new item?  \n\nI just feel like I&#039;m missing something here on many of these balance changes.  They make about as much sense as the Xin changes.","replies":[]}
