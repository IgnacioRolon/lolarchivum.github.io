And it&#039;s not just Annie, but many other champs that suddenly she just appears good with.  Is something like this screaming &quot;boosting&quot; to anyone else besides me?  I mean, she doesn&#039;t have any wins with Annie in normals either.  If someone saw my Morg stats they might think &quot;boosting&quot; but then they could see my 19 normal games with her where I practiced.","replies":[]}
