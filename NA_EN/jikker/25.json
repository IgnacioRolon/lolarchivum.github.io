I want to map where we all come from.  Just post where you live (state or province or country -- I'd love to get the EU or Australia guys in here) and I'll be putting it all up on a map using an online GIS program.  If you want to make it more fun, post your rank and average ping so I can actual start analyzing the East Coast argument on a map!  Why make up statistics when I can actually provide them...well to a point.\n\nAs I collect the data I'll periodically update an image on this thread and tell you what trends I find or you can find them yourself if you really want to make the Geographer proud.\n\nSo to start, I live in Maryland, I'm unranked, and I have on average 120 ping\n\nEDIT: It's coming along.  Lots of Eastern and Midwest people.  BTW if you posted and aren't on here either a) I haven't gotten to you yet or b) you didn't give me good information for mapping\n\nUp-to-date =)\n\nSome of you that have changed icons/FEK are not showing up properly anymore and it won't let me edit some to work.  Sorry but for now you are little green pins =/\n\n> Just wondering what world map cuts off half a continent just to put 'murica in the middle? D:\n\nIt's an interactive map I can work with.  What I'm trying to do is zoom in as far as possible without cutting people off so that we can get the best detail.  When analyzing this map, I'm looking for detail not general clustering.  If that means cutting off a bit of dead space well...  Like I said, I'll see if I can post a link to the map itself without it linking to my irl name\n\n\n**RESULTS THUS FAR**: We have a huge collection on the East Coast and Eastern US!  Over half of the points I have placed have been east of the Mississippi.  This is not surprising if you compare it to a map of population density in the US (see below).  And yes, pings tend to be 100+ out there.\n\nhttp://www.top3most.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/United-States-Population-Map.jpg\n\nAlso, note that the region known as the Empty Interior is...well...empty -- a nice little thing to spatially observe.  We've also got a few Australia and Europe friends.  \n\nPerhaps the biggest surprise though is that the ranks are relatively well distributed.  We have a few more western Diamonds, but we've got our share of Plats and Diamonds out East, some with decently high ping to boot!  In other words, it makes a difference and I think we are showing that East Coast servers would be beneficial, but it doesn't mean it's going to stop you from progressing if you put your mind to it.\n\nRest of maps on page 9 post because I ran out of attachments\n\nThanks all for participating!","replies":[]}
