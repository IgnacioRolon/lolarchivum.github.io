BBQ with lots of good food then shot off a ton of fireworks lighting them with sparklers cause we couldn&#039;t find the punk.  Only real problem was the finale fountain shot off two tubes then failed to ignite the next so we cut it open and lit it ourselves to finish it off =P   Even now the neighbors are shooting mortars off and every time one goes off the house shakes a bit.
