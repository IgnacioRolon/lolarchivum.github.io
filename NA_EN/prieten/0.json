So i keep getting ms problems on euw account. On eune sometimes too but minor. From 40 i usually play with it goes to 80 and feels like 200 :D even freezes for some moments but still showing 80 . Its kinda annoying knowing that i got demoted from d1 right before the season will end because of this funny little problem. Happens like everygame. It goes up and down.
