Once you're in the client, you can jump into a game using the **PLAY** button in the top-left before you'll be greeted with the Game Modes available. I'd recommend playing a lot of Co-Op VS. AI matches under *Beginner* before you start hopping into *Intermediate* matches and eventually, into PvP.\n\nPlease reply to this post if you have any other questions, I'd be happy to address any that I can. ^.^\nhttp://imgur.com/a/TY43c","replies":[]}]}
