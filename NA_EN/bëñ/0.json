I was 1 win off getting lv 5 mastery with yasuo and we wn the game. I ranked up to mastery lv 5 and was awarded a S therefore giving me a mastery lv 6 token. I played another game (back to back) and I earned a S-. But there is a problem. When I go into hextech crafting I see only 1 Token. I don't know if this a bug or something but I hope I get my efforts worth out of yasuo. I Tried restarting the client but didn't work. \nPlease someone help me or tell me if you have had this experience {{champion:157}}","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-29T16:33:36.707+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"An account can receive a token if the champion is already level 5 when the match begins.  It's not possible to trigger both at the same time upon reaching level 5.  A banner will appear upon reaching level 5 mastery, but it's an introduction to the token system; not for actually receiving one.  Let me know if you have any questions!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-07-29T16:30:43.643+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You have to already be level 5 to earn a token, so the notification was either the one that informs you how to receive them (rather than saying you did get one), or it was a visual bug.","replies":[]}]}
