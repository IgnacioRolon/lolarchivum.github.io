I'm talking about 150 fps down to around 5 every time I moved my mouse. I even updated my drivers and changed my graphics from the highest settings to the lowest and it was still happening. I have no idea what is happening because it doesnt happen in any other game.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-12-20T19:02:07.331+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Semi-reposting this because a lot of players have been reporting FPS issues.  I recommend going through the [FPS issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting) guide, this is the best way to help rule out possibilities with the most common cases.\n\nOn PC see if capping frame rates, swapping to Borderless, or toggling V-sync helps.  Windows 10 also had an update, make sure your drivers are current!\n\nFor Mac users, look into your OS version and check for updates!  If you are using Nvida on your Mac, these [378.10 drivers ](http://www.nvidia.com/download/driverResults.aspx/126538/en-us)may help.\n\nFinally, Snowdown may be causing stress for your PC.  Toggling [Close Client During Game](https://i.gyazo.com/a39e12ca76e54359342203c476a0e9c1.png)  can help, as well as toggling off Snowdown assets via in-game options.\n\nIf the issue persists, download our [hextech repair tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367) to collect some logs and attach them to a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).
