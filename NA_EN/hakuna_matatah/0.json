We played some bot games around 11:30 PST to try out new mages (we played Vlad and Veigar in intermediate 5v5 bots) and saw that message before the first game we started. I got it in lobby, he got it in the same time but he wasn't in lobby yet. He's in NYC on a laptop and I'm in Vegas on a desktop, so it's very different setups. We just hit okay, didn't restart, and had no in-game issues, but I thought I'd chime in. Didn't see it for the rest of the night, but haven't played today yet.\n\nCome to think of it, I remember one other strange thing. When I started the client after my patch, it acted like I'd never logged into the client before. It gave me the pop up about how new dynamic queue and hextech crafting works, and then when I clicked on my champ page it didn't default to my usual filter (sort by mastery, owned champs) like it usually does. I figured it was just due to the huge patch.....","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SirSmokeysAlot","date":"2016-05-06T05:41:00.549+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been getting the same message. I've noticed if I don't relog my friends list looks all weird showing some friends who are not logged in with my online friends (I use the only online friends options).
