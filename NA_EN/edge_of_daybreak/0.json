He can utilize the Stealth on his R as well, but the outplay potential of that is small, especially when truesight comes in to play.\n\nWhen can we expect a Talon rework?

As it's been said in other replies, there has been quite a few \"fictional\" reworks for Talon from players, from many regions, so you might find some good ideas over there.   I find this quite a nice change, as Talon has suffered much since his silence removal. He can still burst champs to death, but he hasn't a backup plan as many other assassins do (Katarina's reset, Kha'zix jump reset, Ahri's 3 use ult, Ekko's ult, and a long etc), so it's not strange to find a Talon dead in the first second of the teamfight after having deleted someone (or at least tried to), where maybe a Katarina would be still jumping arond, or a Zed would have come back to his shadow.  After seeing the reworks you've been doing to many champs, and how you have succeeded in making  more unique champions, i trust you to make of Talon the deadly assassin he is supposed to be in a cool way. \n\nI'd suggest to keep or even improve the stealth. Not as much as an Evelynn, but maybe something a bit more complex and rewarding that his current ultimate.  Go for it!

Original developer intent's something we like to refer to since it can offer useful insights into how to improve a champion and we'll certainly tap Hephestopheles for his thoughts when doing work on Talon at some point. Working on a champion puts you in a great position to help maintain and develop them after they go out, it doesn't mean you continue to control everything about them based off your personal preferences though. Doing what's right for the character/game is the most important thing and means that if we grab Hephestopheles to chat about changing Talon his response is almost certainly going to be something along the lines of 'awesome, how can we make him better?'.","replies":[{"poster":"Earl Eulrich","date":"2015-08-11T13:51:59.676+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">Giving Talon a reason to auto attack a bit more's a solid goal for a passive on him.

And it always leads to very binary situations were a Champ kills a lot faster than he should do, leaving almost no reaction time for his opponent. You basically have a lot of good ideas and kits in the game, but most of them get thwarted by the current crit-mechanic, that adds a lot of  burst to sth. that should be about sustained dmg (auto-attacking).","replies":[{"poster":"pripustas","date":"2015-08-11T17:03:14.451+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The problem with assassins auto attacking is they don't build attack speed, as there is no good AD+AS item.
