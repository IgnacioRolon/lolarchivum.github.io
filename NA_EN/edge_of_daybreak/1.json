So meddler what are your current thoughts on talon&#039;s direction and is he going to get a different ability for his E in aram. I would love to be able to just jump off the bridge and die but I am open to all kinds of ideas :D The darkness will be that there is nothing coming. I&#039;ll just cry into my useless lethality runes.","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2016-12-07T20:09:56.868+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":4,"body":"We don't have any immediate plans for Talon.

Even if you get fed early, you can't even assassinste their adc (as an assassin) and his playrate is dropping, and I've seen no improvement in win rate according to champion.gg. Hid burst is so slow. And I don't get why you guys hate talon so much. You called his one blink that's on a long cooldown, vs kats thats on a .3 sec cool down and they both did the same thing. Kats an aoe bomb also. Every one at talonmains discord and sub Reddit is wondering when he's getting buffs, and dreaming for a revert of his rework (similar to kog) I just want to know if you are aware of his buggy kit and that his burst isn't existent and his late game is horrible. \n\n-Reaper","replies":[{"poster":"Volcanuz","date":"2016-12-16T07:16:30.318+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just means he is an early game champion now.

If you want a more accurate estimate of his power then maybe you could try making him feel a little more like he used to in areas that weren't in need of balance changes. It doesn't make much sense to nerf a champion's mobility in lane in exchange for situational mobility and then proceed to nerf its overall move-speed, especially with the high cd on his e at early levels imo.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Edge of Daybreak","date":"2016-12-08T06:57:51.769+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have 0 clue if you go back to threads or even check people who quote you but I just thought of something and well I figured why make a whole other thread since there is still this one. Okay so remember back when you guys made it so you could trigger ghostblade while stealthed and it didn't break it? Why not let Talon vault walls without breaking his stealth? Now this isn't even a numbers change but I feel this would add a lot of power when used correctly because being able to sneak up on targets would fit the assassin theme a lot more. Plus if he has to burn half his ult to do it I feel that is fair. It dawned on me last game because I vaulted a wall while trying to get closer to someone and well.. let's say it didn't go as planned. Next. I am not sure if his Q can be used to detonate his passive but well I guess what I want for christmas is that :D if that target would have the last stack be applied by the Q let that trigger the passive. Or if the passive is ready to pop due to say ult and W. let the next Q pop it.","replies":[{"poster":"sunden12","date":"2016-12-08T19:17:00.852+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can ult mid jump and it kinda gives that effect, enemy can still see you if yoru slow with it tho","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"sunden12","date":"2016-12-07T23:39:14.544+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Question, with talon be as he is have you thought about instead of ratio/damage changes that he might just need some tweaks into delays when using moves? i noticed a some what annoying delay from when i ult to when my crit q hits.
