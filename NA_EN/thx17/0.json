Sorry to hear about that crashes, and I'd like to help with some more info.  When you say crash, are you getting any error messages?  A bugsplat?  Does it happen at any specific point in the match?\n\nRegarding your chest, I took a look into this for you and it looks like you unlocked a Summoner Icon (Kuro).  These automatically unlock without spending essences, and is available in your inventory.\n\nLet me know!","replies":[{"poster":"thx17","date":"2017-05-02T21:54:56.567+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First of all, i will put my pc info\ni7 6700 \nnvidea 1060m\n16gb \ngame installation on SSD\n\nAbout the chest im clear, thank you.\nNo i dont get any messages, for example, 40 mins ago +/-, i turn on my pc, and started a normal game, when the loading stop and champions appear the game crashed, i just opened the buy thing to buy an item and it crashed, the sound continues, and i continues to have chat in my client  (my friend ask for me not coming), i waited and nothinh happened, tried ctrl+alt+del but the pc dont let me open task , and this happen to me 3 times today.

The really interesting piece here is that you can still hear sounds while playing.  That must mean you're still connected to the match but a hardware or driver issue stopped responding so nothing is coming up.  Go over the steps in the [FPS issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting) guide to troubleshoot this, making sure to go over each step to rule out possibilities.
