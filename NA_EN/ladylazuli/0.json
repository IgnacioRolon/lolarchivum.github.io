The most common solution is to [uninstall](http://www.cnet.com/how-to/how-to-uninstall-an-app-or-program-in-windows-10/) all current versions of C++ 2005 in your list of programs.\n\nAfter you've uninstalled all 2005 versions, go ahead and restart your PC. After your PC boots back up, ensure you've installed all available [windows updates](http://www.update.microsoft.com/). After ensuring your system is current on updates, download and install a fresh copy of [Visual C++ 2005](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=3387). \n\nLet me know if this helped. :)","replies":[]}]}
