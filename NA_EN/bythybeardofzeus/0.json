I go to a ranked que, I pretty much exclusively played ranked solo que, so obviously I take it seriously, I will get a bugsplat message, and i think hey no biggie, I'll just restart the client and reconnect after many attempts to just reconnect normally. Well last week when I tried to relogin a window pops up that makes me redownload the entire patch before I can reconnect, same thing happened to me today. Hence I lose my series after the first game, so I am very annoyed because uhh this isnt my fault? Why do i have to suffer an afk game penalty when I tried EVERYTHING to get it to reconnect without redownloading the patch. I played many games today and last night with no issues, and then randomly (my third game of today) this happens? Makes me not want to play any more. Its hard enough to win in silver as it is, without getting free losses handed to me. \r\n\r\nCan someone from riot please tell me why this is happening or if anyone else is having the same difficulty? Thanks.\r\n-Zeus","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-02-02T19:01:56.901+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for your detailed post on this, though it sucks to hear you're crashing.  Bugsplats occur when something with your drivers, game files, or hardware is failing to render the game.  It's very unlikely that this is a connection issue, so a restart wouldn't resolve this unfortunately.  Instead, go through our [game crash](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes+) guide to make sure that your PC is in good shape and fix this up.  \n\nEven if your leaves are not intentional, they still cause others a negative experience and [leaverbuster](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ) would only occur after more than one leave.  Let me know if you have any questions!","replies":[{"poster":"ByThyBeardOfZeus","date":"2017-02-02T19:54:29.896+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the quick response, \nI guess the issue I have is that it negatively impacts how I experience the game too, yet it is something that is outside of my control. I'll check out the game crash guide and see if I can find some answers, \n\nI guess I just wanted the tribunal or whoever is in charge of bans and stuff to have documented evidence my recent leaves are NOT intentional, and that with the amount of hours and dollars I have spent playing this game, that I take ranked seriously. Since I got banned for a similar issue in season 3, but that was my ISP having crappy service in the area. I'm not on the \"rito pls\" bandwagon or something here just wanted someone to be aware please don't give me the afk ban haha. Anyways thanks again\n\n-Zeus","replies":[]}]}]}
