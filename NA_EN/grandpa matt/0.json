I just got off a game and my account was banned. Not understanding why I look at my chat logs to see my last game, where i wasn&#039;t toxic at all and other games where i was toxic probably a good 9 days ago.\r\n\r\nafter asking support what was the problem they pointed out that asking people to be reported is infact a bannable offense.\r\n\r\nAfter i get off my two week suspension I knew full well i was on thin ice. Before my two weeks i knew i was also being an asshole and deserved my 2 week suspension. I admit i slipped up a week ago and deserve being reported that game. Do i deserve being perma&#039;d for asking the enemy team to report someone who left my lane to go afk in the base? absolutely not. Do i think i should have a game held over my head for longer than a week? absolutely not. \r\n\r\nLike i get it. I fucked up and I have to start over now. Do I think its fair? no. If i was deserving of a perma then I would accept it but I feel like its not placed right. I tried very hard to keep my mouth shut since my 2 week and its showed that. I&#039;ve probably played 200 games since then easy in the last two weeks with no issue but apparently asking for someone to be reported for griefing is really just that bad. \r\n\r\nI used to think that bans were a case by case basis but now its clear to me that they are not. if you see my chat logs where my last game i asked someone to be reported not once did i flame anyone. wasn&#039;t homophobic wasn&#039;t racist. no, what got me in trouble was asking in all chat please report this person who is greifing me. I&#039;ve come to resent how the report system works. The brand who was afk? nothing will happen to him. My jungler and top laner who taunted me all game and in post chat? nothing will happen to them, but me asking politely to punish a player who decided they did not want to win, yeah I&#039;ll get in trouble for that. \r\n\r\nsorry for the rant. thanks for listening.","replies":[{"poster":"Jo0o","date":"2018-12-08T05:08:55.046+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can't directly comment on your chat logs, since you haven't provided them. If you do, we can tell you exactly what went wrong. \n\nI can say, though, that you've clearly played about 23 games since your two-week ban, not 200. That's nowhere near enough time to somehow redeem yourself in Riot's eyes to get more leniency added to your account.","replies":[]},{"poster":"rujitra","date":"2018-12-08T02:34:13.359+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"You admit you were toxic at least in some games.

Riot considers asking for reports (especially when additional reports on someone make absolutely no difference; their behavior in that match is reviewed just the same either way) to be harassment/unsportsmanlike, and thus bannable. Riot believes that infractions should stay on someone's record indefinitely, therefore they do. While you play Riot's game, they will judge you by their rules, which you broke, and punish you according to their system, which they did. You can  judge people according to your rules when you run your own game.","replies":[]}]}
