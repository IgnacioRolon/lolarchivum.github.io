I don't think this is right as no other champion has an ability that is higher than their ult. (not counting ults like anivia's or maokai's) This is really unfair to viktor players as in certain situations they have to cast their ult and use the cd when they could use a laser.","replies":[{"poster":"ricklessabandon","date":"2014-07-16T07:41:35.666+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"traditional supports commonly have a basic ability that costs more than their ultimate (nami, janna, soraka, *et al*) as well as several mages that have an ability with strong wave clear potential (lux, morgana, viktor, *et al*). there isn't really a hard rule hereâ€”a mana cost is just one of several factors that 'gate' an ability's use, so we try to balance it around those factors within the context of the kit and the scenarios within that champion may find themselves.\n\nviktor as a specific example is someone we'd like to look at sometime in the future (re: his mana situation) but the relationship between his *death ray* cost and his *chaos storm* cost isn't inherently problematic.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cerbearus","date":"2014-07-15T03:52:32.507+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A lot of champs have this.
