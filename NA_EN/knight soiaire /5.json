Tanks are categorized in 3 different roles. \n1) Juggernauts: Immobile bruisers with high hp, sustain and executionable damage\n2) Wardens: Peeling tanks, usually scale of defense to peel for allies and cc enemies. (This is the one that you were referring to and yes Braum is Warden so ofcourse he is doing his job perfectly)\n3) Vanguards: Aggressive and initiating tanks, they were never meant to peel for allies, but instead, they were meant to go ham on enemy team and dive and kill their target while providing an amount of CC to help them initiating the fights.\n\nYou can't mention all of them as \"tank\" it is wrong.\nYou are talking specifically about \"Wardens\" and yes I agree with you there, Wardens need to be more tanky and less of damage dealers to peel allies. However, if we talk about Vanguards, I would rather they receive more itemization to help their initiating and provide them more savage teamfights.","replies":[{"poster":"Galiö","date":"2020-02-14T14:33:47.907+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Juggernauts are not tanks, they are under fighter subclass.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BigFBear","date":"2020-02-13T13:34:29.305+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"The thing is.

In any other format, you need a reason for people to hit you as a tank. Look at Overwatch, a game with \"Tanks\" yet each and everyone of those tanks have their own form of high damage output. Not as good as the DPS's of course, but they're still very much a kill threat. Reinhardt can kill you in what, 3 or 4 swings of his hammer? Most the other tanks can kill anyone squishy when up-close, less so when they're far away. Can one-shot folk if he lands his charge. \n\nWhy? Because they have no way of forcing you to deal with them as tanks. They can't force you to shoot them. Sure, you can go the Braum route and give them lots of abilities that can deny damage, most the tanks in Overwatch actually do have a version of that. Orisa and Reinhardt shield, Dva's defense matrix,  Feet-fetish boy's shield. By giving them damage, your team is forced to handle these big tanky boys, allowing them to actually put their tankiness to use instead of just being ignored. \n\nWhy isn't that enough for them, why can't they take away damage and load them with those kinds of abilities?\n\nBecause then we reach a problem of interactivity. Everyone hates Yasuo's shield wall, but imagine if every tank in the game had an ability like that. This actually did happen in Overwatch, with Shield Meta, where you had Bridgette, Reinhardt and Orisa on the same team, and it was just shield after shield after shield. I never played it, so I'd have to go off the anecdotal evidence of my friend that it fucking sucked. Or perhaps the similarly disliked 3-tank Meta. \n\nSimply put, it feels bad to have your efforts constantly negated. Tanks are harder to kill, pack them with too many abilities designed to soak or stop things from happening, and it gets boring. By diluting their power pool with damage, not only do you expand the players options by giving them more tools to punish people who are out of place, contribute to kill someone/being able to Lane at all, but you also stop it from going too far into frustration zone of \"Can't kill this person\" or \"I don't get to do anything because they exist\". \n\nRemember, just as being able to do too much damage is a bad thing, being able to tank too much is equally a bad thing. Damage for tanks gives them options in lane and also makes them far less reliant on having the other person make up for the damage you lack.","replies":[{"poster":"Saezio","date":"2020-02-13T09:36:37.852+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are champions that none can tank.

The only way that this could happen is that adc can't position properly. But you don't really do that unless you flash and enemy adc doesn't have peel supp. Adcs usually got qss too so this is the biggest BS ever. Seems like you are the one who didn't play tank meta. It was the best state of the game competitively wise.

Tanks like Muradin or Diablo don't do much damage, but they're incredibly durable and their job is to break front/backlines and disrupting DPS from coordinating damage on their teammates.\n\nIt seems like that entire role has only been given to tank supports like Leona and Nautilus while everybody else gets screwed because they have to solo lane/jungle as a weak 1v1 tank.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Noraver","date":"2020-02-13T12:18:17.007+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Knight SoIaire ,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=PPvcE9qu,comment-id=,timestamp=2020-02-12T18:54:33.026+0000)\n>\n\n> We had {{champion:57}} with his ult draiining nearby damage but riot deleted it.... if i rememver correctly they deleted it because they didnt like that it dealt damage based off enemys damage... which was easy to fix with some number showelling.
