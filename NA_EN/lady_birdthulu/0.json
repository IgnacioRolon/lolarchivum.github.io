I click on it and the box to purchase is completely greyed out.\r\n\r\nI wondered about the Splended bundle- the same thing- the box is greyed out.\r\n\r\nBuuut if I wanted to I'm sure I could purchase a skin- those boxes aren't greyed out.\r\n\r\nI already logged and re-logged JUST to see if my RP balance was in fact false. It's still 2534.\r\n\r\nso... are the bundles just temporarily locked?
