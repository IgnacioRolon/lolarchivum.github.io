I haven't change anything with the computer. Haven't downloaded anything, no updates to update, just randomly had my client updated and now i can't be on league without major lag. I've switched to playing league on lowest quality and set it to 25fps setting, ive tried every fps setting btw. Some help would be very nice. I just want to be on/play league without lag. So please if you can riot help me out a little.","replies":[{"poster":"Sygnetix","date":"2016-11-24T01:13:51.952+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ever since the day the beta client launched, league of legends has become nearly unplayable for me. My ping is fine and my fps is fine, yet it seems I'm somehow not syncing properly.\n\nIn desperation, I updated to the new client. That did not help. Nor did:\n\nDoing an html5 test to confirm it was not my ISP.\n\nRepatching.\n\nUpdating video drivers.\n\nConfirming my RAM was seated properly.\n\nChecking packet loss via tracert in cmd prompts (ps: tracert's to www.pvp.net result in some garbage packet loss...only url that I can think of to check that does).\n\nReinstalling.\n\nRunning the repair tool.\n\nDefraging my HD.\n\nCleaning the registry.\n\nI am at a loss of words. The night before the beta client launch, everything was fine. Since then, the game is unplayable. I feel as though I have gone above and beyond reasonable end-user fixes. It's someone else's turn.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-24T00:18:04.136+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I believe this is something the client devs are looking into, and are aware some folks are lagging on the new client.

If this is what you meant, let me know!\n\nWell, to be honest I have been lagging a lot more in-game on both clients as soon as new one was released. But it seems like your saying the in-game lag doesn't have to do with the clients. So I don't know what to do about that. But champ select, messaging, scrolling through store ect. have been lagging on new client. I'm using the legacy client for now due to that. It lags a little here and there, but not as much as the new client. It's just kind of strange how everything was working fine until it auto-updated the client. If you can help, it would be very appreciated.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"HotSjokzGG PT","date":"2016-11-24T17:43:49.855+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same problem.
