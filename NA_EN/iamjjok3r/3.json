It doesn't drop below 200 ever. Randomly my ping will shoot up to 5000 and I'll get D/C this isn't ever so often, no this is 8-9 a game. In the past when I would get high ping it was only for a day at the most then it would go back down to 70. Before the servers where changed I was getting 16 ping. It was great. I have change computers over that 2 years, each getting better and better. But when it comes to league my ping and fps are so low. Before this 400 ping problem I had 30fps with 70 ping. I've tried the things on the riotgames support site. That are suppose to help. They haven't made anything better, everything is just the same. right now every game is 7fps 400 ping. It's gotten to the point where I'm about to quit playing since I can't play it. All the other games I play I get 60fps and everything is fine. When I play I only have league open. I have all settings on lowest they can be. I don't play with sound at all. If anyone can help me I would greatly appreciate it. I would hate to have to quit league because of this.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-01T22:12:09.902+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sometimes those weird random ping spikes can be attributed to packet loss instead of a bad connection.

Hit up our [**log reader**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743) and toss your recent game logs which had these ping spikes in.

Sometimes we can adjust some of your network settings to help, and other times it ends up being on the ISP side of things.
