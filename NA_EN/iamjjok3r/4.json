Most of the time players can fix it by relogging, and this actually happened to myself and relogging fixed it on my end. Give that a try and let me know if it helps or not!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kokua","date":"2017-11-26T10:28:40.663+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is this with a specific emote that you're trying to use, or any emote in general (meaning you've tried multiple different emotes). It appears that you at least still have access to your emotes page. I haven't been able to even open that page since around the start of preseason, with EM01 and EM05 errors. For a few days, my old emote setup also disappeared completely, leaving me unable to use any emotes. I currently am unable to edit any of my emotes, but at least I'm once again able to use the ones I set up previously. Obviously there are issues with their emote system.","replies":[]}]}
