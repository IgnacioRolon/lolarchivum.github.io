It is a pretty big sample, and widely accepted as true by anyone with a brain in said games. hopping to EU for trading/social stuff is common in some.\n\nJust because you dont like it does not make it fake.","replies":[{"poster":"Percentages","date":"2018-04-05T08:24:35.219+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, that is your OPINION.
