Now it has LCD ink over it so I have to plug my computer into a monitor. However, when I start playing, sometimes the monitor freezes and shows a portion of the loading screen/in game but I can still hear League and it seems that I can still control my champion. When I turn my monitor off, League shows up on my laptop but rather enlarged than its regular size. I only can fix this by restarting/shutting down then booting my computer back up. As a result, I have to login again, wait for the game to load, and the next thing you know, I get reported. Is there anyone who knows how to fix this?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-17T22:57:50.387+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you might have driver issues that's struggling to render the game, even though you're connected to the game.  The change in resolution further affirms this, but I'm not sure if you'll be able to get better drivers with your older OS version.
