His whole mechanic is to leave some health pots bot lane and then roam most of the game. Would they ban a smite bard support for roaming?\nI doubt it, because riot designed him to be a roaming support who rarely, if at all goes to bot lane other than to check up and leave some pots.\nIf players use other champions like Nunu and Singed to effectively do the same thing as Bard does then how is it different? Why would they get banned without a removal announcement for Bard when he's almost as off meta a roaming support as they are, and plays to a similar set strategy and fantasy? It's Riot games, not MontethePython's games, so i respect how they want to run their company and i'll continue playing so long as i enjoy it, but atleast give us clarification of how your system works, because you claim not to punish for off-meta picks, and yet you seem to only mean you won't ban for certain off-meta picks.\n\n\"Poor communication\" is not an excuse for banning someone who's communicating fine but playing an off meta pick successfully. I see a lot more Meta picks who never type all game, Hell, most players rarely type to communicate game strategy or explain themselves anyway. Why are these generic silent Viktor mids not banned for Poor communication while a pick rioters don't like who communicates in game is? Seems like the banning for playing off meta system is mostly based of the rioter's bias who handles the report. Instead of operating off blind bias please let us know what is acceptable and outline some guidelines for what off meta picks and roles you find acceptable and unacceptable, because it's obvious that previous statements saying Riot does not punish or discourage off meta roles and picks is no longer true.\n\nAlso, WookieCookie said: \"I will be working with the team to clarify an escalation process that emphasizes clearer feedback and opens the door for ban reductions if we believe that someone can make changes to their play style allowing them to continue crushing the meta but not at the expense of their teammates.\"\nWell isn't any off meta choice going to have it's own pros and cons? Either way if you play any off meta pick it will be somehow at a certain expense to your teamates, as well as a certain advantage to your teammates. Only banning certain off meta playstyles' but not others because they have different downsides seems biased and hypocritical. Why is the MF support who takes some farm and builds Frost Queen's claim not banned while the nunu smite support who roams and counterjungles is? It simply doesn't seem fair for someone to get punished for something there are no guidelines on.\n\nTldr: Why does Bard get a pass for leaving his adc alone all game while others get banned for it. Why are only certain roaming supports ok? Atleast give us some guidlines Riot","replies":[{"poster":"LostFr0st","date":"2017-02-28T15:46:33.189+0000","up_votes":47,"down_votes":15,"body":"They did give guidelines; it's actually pretty clear.\nThe person needs to actually communicate instead of talking at his/her team.\n\nIf you go read the recent Nunu case's twitch faq under his stream it's clear he doesn't GAF about his teammates' in-game experience.

I.e. A \"tactical disagreement\", if you will. Meaning, In the majority of ranked games played, there will usually always be that _somebody_ who will either flip out if you want to go off-meta, or at the very least disagree with off-meta because _they don't think it will win_, or someone that won't say anything but then if you lose the game they'll report you and grief that way.  Basically, kids that are whiny and pout because others aren't conforming to the game _they want_. Either you have open-ness and allow off meta (as it's currently \"supposed to be\"), or you come down hard and restrict off-meta in ranked or whatever, and set specific guidelines for each role, etc and essentially enforce the current meta. Any changes to the meta then should be examined only by riot specialists or a selected group of players before given the green light to exist in all elo's, and then players know that during ranked games. They need to conform to whatever the current meta-game is currently being played, or risk punishment.","replies":[{"poster":"AeroWaffle","date":"2017-02-28T22:54:05.087+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"I just want to get this straight then;\n\nYou feel like it's fine for people to impose their personal strategies on other people, no matter how much it dislodges them from what they are comfortable in, so long as the person doing the dislodging believes that it is a viable strategy?\n\nBecause I don't.\n\nI believe that both sides should attempt to come to an agreement if someone wants to play something that isn't common knowledge.

Sure they can farm under tower a bit, but even that can become a dangerous prospect should the enemy lane dive or even be pushed in long enough to take the tower. And as this goes on, the ADC will become more and more starved and fall further and further behind. \n\nADC's NEED a gold income, farming is the most dependable way to achieve this. Take that away but losing lane presence and the ADC is essentially useless, sure they can roam for kills, but we all know that farm matters a lot.

My point is simply that he can't pick \"roam support\" or \"counter jungle\" because that isn't an option. This gives Bot lane the assumption that whomever queued up as SUP will remain with him in bot lane. \n\nThis is the main reason why he gets reported, because he doesn't stay and ensure the bot lane gets fed but instead focuses on other winning lanes and map control knowing bot will suffer. If bot lane knew ahead of time that there was a possibility that his SUP could be \"counter jungle\" or roaming most of the game then at least he wouldn't have an expectation for nunu to live up to.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"arghilost","date":"2017-02-28T20:47:06.239+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I main jungle nasus in diamond 1.
