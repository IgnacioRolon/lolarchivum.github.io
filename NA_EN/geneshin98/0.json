After the game i logged off to take care of some things. Got home and open league and type my password and shortly after i get a msg saying \"PLAYER BANNED- This account has been permanently suspended. Please check the email address associated with your League of legends account for additional details\". i check my email address and i have got nothing from league! The most resent email i got from league is on jun 30 about voil and fizz toy or what ever, and the other is league thanking me for spending my $100 to get RP. Why i have not gotten any email about my fucking account getting fucking PERMANENTLY BANNED???? WHAT IS THE FUCKING REASON? FOR SPENDING MY HARD EARN MONEY SO THAT I CAN GET BANNED WITHOUT AND FUCKING NOTICE??!!!! PLEASE EXPLAIN! RIOT!!!!!!!!!!  And its weird that i can logg in to this league website but i get banned on league! (i should not be swearing but you guys trying to put yourself in my shoes, you would be mad as i am at this moment)","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-21T02:58:01.436+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think I might see the main issue with what's going on with your account.
