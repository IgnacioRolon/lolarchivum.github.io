I just red that their are some issues with 7.7 and frame drops.\n\nWell I guess I need to wait till riot moves the lazy ass and fixes the problem.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-07T22:00:04.776+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Some of the issues you're describing *almost* sound like your network could be having some issues with packet loss, so let's be sure to check for that really quickly first. Grab some recent network logs from a match that had this weird lag and fps spikes, and let our [**log reader**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743) scan it. Afterward, take a screenshot and post it here using something like Gyazo so I can go over it with you.","replies":[{"poster":"Malsquandor","date":"2017-08-08T00:09:17.972+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm having the same issue. Lots of packet loss all throughout today.

Most of the time it originates outside of your own network, so be sure to try reaching out to your ISP to see if there are any current issues but also hit up our tech guys in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new). There might be something we could adjust within your network to get you a smoother connection.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
