Grades are based on your performance vs the average, not how hard you TDMed. The Lulu had a great Lulu game, while you merely had a good game for your respective champ/role.","replies":[{"poster":"Ãbdul28","date":"2018-01-28T03:39:03.283+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It was a 3v3 lulu bot garen top i jungle\nShe was making ap items not support items. i was in the jungle i did the objectives so, still confusing\nShe had a {{item:3027}} and {{item:3303}}","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-01-28T03:04:51.400+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is based on more than KDA. Wards, CC, CS, objectives, general presence count for a lot.\n\n Most importantly, the score is based on averages for the champion you are playing, the role you are playing, at your matchmaking ELO. Someone playing Janna is not going to get 20 kills and 300 CS in a great game, but someone playing an ADC or top can.\n\nEvery champion+role has its own grade curve, which is why it is easier to get S ranks playing off-meta.","replies":[{"poster":"Ãbdul28","date":"2018-01-28T03:05:56.786+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was a diana.","replies":[]}]}]}
