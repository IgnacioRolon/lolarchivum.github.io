As soon as I get in the Lunar Revel Shop, Kassidin pops up with Harbringer skin for 529 RP and I can not buy it. An error keeps popping up. I have tried logging on and off again and again and it still will not work. What can I do?\r\n\r\nError reads:\r\n\r\n&quot;An unexpected error has occurred, please check back again later.&quot;","replies":[{"poster":"Zombiemaster","date":"2016-01-29T22:35:08.850+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is the same problem people had with the Snowdown Shop. Basically, there are 2 reasons why you would be unable to buy a skin from the Lunar Revel shop:\n\n1.) The skin you want to buy is currently on sale in the normal store,\n\nor\n\n2.) The champion of that skin is currently on sale in the normal store (this only applies if you don't own the champion).\n\nFor you, my guess is that you do not own Kassadin, and because Kassadin is currently 50% off in the normal store, you are unable to buy Kassadin and his Harbinger skin in your Lunar Revel shop. Now, you can do one of 2 things:\n\n1.) Wait until Kassadin is no longer on sale, which will be by the end of today,\n\nor\n\n2.) Purchase Kassadin right now for 50% off (or with IP).\n\nEither of these options should allow you to make the purchase. I recommend waiting until tomorrow if the discount you have is greater than 50% so that you don't spend as much RP.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-01-30T02:17:36.399+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for posting this! :D","replies":[{"poster":"FFF1","date":"2016-01-30T04:44:31.927+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Can we get a Riot response on http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report/NOdgp0E7-per-side-offset-is-currently-not-working-as-of-62\n\nor \n\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report/e84evOh7-camera-lock-offset-not-working-as-of-62\n\nor\n\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report/Kd0Nr8jE-camera-lock-per-side-offset-bug\n\nor\n\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report/AJzUihpx-ill-take-fixing-the-camera-offset-bug-over-this-lunar-sale\n\nor\n\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report/armXuvd5-per-side-offset-not-working-on-red-side-is-normal-fixed-offset\n\nPLEASE?!","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"SH4D0W5","date":"2016-01-29T22:59:24.878+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you so much!","replies":[]}]}
