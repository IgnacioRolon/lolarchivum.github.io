Maybe you could make some quick fanart for those too ;) \n\nZiggs\nHaving a young dragon by his side and a hatcling on his shoulder. The hatchling spits out eggs7fireballs (like tristana eggs) in his hand every auto. The young dragon by side shoots out his abilities. Q and W is 2 different fireball/eggs that is shot out by the dragon. E is an egg that it spits on the ground, hits with it's tail and it scatters as small mines whereever. His ult is the young dragon charging up and shooting a massive fireball up in the air and then down.\n\nRumble\nRiding a big masculine chubby dragon with small wings, big tail with spikes, big mouth and massive feet. Q= Dragon breathes fire. W= Dragon hovers/flies in the air and gets hard skin. E= Flings it's tail and spikes shoot out. R= Dragon spits out fireballs that lands in a line putting magma/lava.\nP= 100% heat dragon gets more fire ish and red.  Fire/magma dripping out of it's mouth. Claws/hands on fire.\nover 50% heat abilities become more flame ish.\n\nCorki\nRiding a flying dragon with proper sized wings. Q: Fireball that lands and explodes. W: Flies over terrain while breathing fire on the ground. E: Tiny fireballs with a trail of fire behind it like a bullet on fire. R: Big flaming fireball.\n\nGnar\nGnar is a special kind of yordle and therefore he should be a special kind of Dragon Trainer. Instead of a boomerang he's carrying a small flying dragon. The dragon works with small Gnar. The small hatchling is flying next to him and shoots fireballs out every auto. Q: Gnar grabs the dragon by the tail like a toy and throws in a direction. The hatcling spins around confused till end of range and then flies back still spinning, where Gnar grabs it and it flies again by his side. Mini Gnars other abilities is kinda like the same. When Gnar gets enraged and become mega Gnar he becomes a giant dragon and his small dragon flies on his back.  Mega Gnars ability changes are... Q: Gnars paw/claws/hand lits on fire and the stone he throws is flaming. W: Molten/magma/red glowing in the cracks of the ground when he smash it. E: Mega Gnar flaps his tiny wings and flies/jumps a small distance and smashes down. Molten/magma/red glowing in the cracks of the ground he smashes. R: Gnars hands flames up and and short timed fire trails is in the grounds when he flings them towards in the ground.\n\nTeemo\nTeemo got a hatcling with him that shoots small fire balls instead of darts. Instead of poisonous damage over time effects they will now be with flames. His shrooms are replaced with dragons eggs that detonates in fire when stepped on.\n\nNot sure about Kennen and Poppy (Amumu, if he's still a yordle).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Duke Anax","date":"2015-11-23T13:59:32.712+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dragon trainer Corki works nice too.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mestm97","date":"2015-11-22T09:08:51.835+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well Dragon Master swain could be the villian","replies":[{"poster":"MoloMan8D","date":"2015-11-22T09:22:02.476+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Mestm97,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=upAoYcr1,comment-id=00010001,timestamp=2015-11-22T09:08:51.835+0000)\n>\n> Well Dragon Master swain could be the villian\n\nDragon slayers though...","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"ThePartyLeader","date":"2015-11-21T22:01:26.841+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dragon trainer azir.
