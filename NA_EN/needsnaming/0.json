I demand a refund on the dozens of min of my life you have punished me to sit here because you can't code in global exception handling to catch client crashes. (I have 10+ years of coding experience, it isn't hard to do this. yet you refuse to listen about my complaints on any of the boards. no matter which board I choose, they get closed due to \"being in the wrong board\". How about you just add global exception handling on crash to the client. You do it with bug splat. I'd be happy to write it myself. I have some free time. Shouldn't take more then a few days with testing.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-02T18:14:06.118+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Crashes in champ select are often caused by an unstable or poor connection to the server. Because it's important for your PC to be able to sync with all player's actions in a champ select, any connection drops can cause your client to experience delays in seeing other player's actions or crashing your client entirely. I recommend working through our [connection guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues), as it addresses the most common fixes for this issue.\n\nIf you still have champ select crashes after working through that guide, please let me know.","replies":[]}]}
