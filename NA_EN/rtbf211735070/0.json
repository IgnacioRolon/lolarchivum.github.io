I formatted my PC because I had a lot of problems with, then I installed LOL. I've already installed all Drivers, already tried to lower the quality (I usually play with Medium/High sets), already tried to disable all sounds in game or everything suggested by Riot Support, but nothing has changed. I never had problems like that, can somebody help me? When I play my FPS are 80-50 out of combat and drop at 10-15 when I fight. I can't even play ARAM (my fav modality) coz of this problem. Any suggestions?\r\n-\r\nMy pc:\r\nWindows 10\r\nIntel Core i3 - 1,80 GHz\r\nRam 4 GB\r\nNvidia GeForce GT 720m - 2 GB\r\n(I don't think it's a pc problem because I always played good with M/H settings before now and my FPS were always 150 out of combat and 80-100 in fight).\r\nP.S. I have also tried to close programs like Google Chrome and Spotify, the only one open is TeamSpeak, but even without I can't fix my problem.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-29T03:22:44.815+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm..

When any fight breaks out around Krugs or mid lane out my game drops to 5-10 fps, yet if the same fight breaks out near the center of bot lane the game runs fine. Playing the game at high settings or low settings does not change this issue. \n\nI would guess this is a league specific issues as games like BF1 and Paragon run excellent with no crashes or issues. I am hoping this is fixed as I would rather play LoL. \n\n{{sticker:zombie-nunu-bummed}}","replies":[{"poster":"Too Sweet","date":"2016-11-28T18:44:35.851+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"People been experiencing FPS issues on this patch only?

But I doubt a direct or immediate upgrade is really an option for you, although if it is I would suggest getting an entirely new computer, as every piece of hardware you have is outdated. Otherwise, if that's not an option at the moment, I'd suggest first off, lowering all the quality settings to the lowest, and then also lowering the resolution of the game, and/or playing in windowed mode. I'd suggest looking any of that up on Google if you need to figure out how to do it, should be relatively simple.\n\nOh yeah, and Riot has a page for FPS drops, so if what I said doesn't work or you just feel like checking this first, here ya go:\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting","replies":[{"poster":"Too Sweet","date":"2016-11-28T11:46:09.945+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot's guide doesn't work, I've tried most of those, I even factory reset my laptop.\n\nI've already updated my graphics drivers but I had to roll-back to a previous build since I've noticed that it runs much worse!\neven lowering the graphics, turning off the music, v-sync off, DVR disabled it has NO effect, It doesn't make any sense, because my laptop USED to run League of Legends consistently (My laptop has similar specs as the OP)","replies":[]}]}]}
