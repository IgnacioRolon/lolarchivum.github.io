Teamfights are very difficult as she does alot of damage on her own(as I noticed)...Okay I am VERY sure I am doing something wrong and the reason of this post is to receive help on how to play against Akali. Btw Akali is the only champion I struggle playing against...I MAINLY play support and my favourite champs are Taric and Alistar.\n\nTHANKS :D{{sticker:zombie-nunu-hearts}}","replies":[{"poster":"lilpokfluf","date":"2017-04-20T17:59:25.209+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Too much of a stat check, if and when she decides to go in. Either you die or she does. I personally think she needs an actual rework, she's way too feast or famine and when behind she doesn't have the tools to come back.","replies":[]},{"poster":"FacerollKatarina","date":"2017-04-19T20:22:28.432+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Akali kinda sucks to play against, because now there is no way to counter her shroud, you just have to focus on shutting her down earlier on so that way she can't burst later on.","replies":[{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2017-04-19T20:50:18.928+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes there is, any DoT, AoE or skillshot will make her shimmer, and tether abilities (like Leblanc's E or Kled's Q will make her outright targetable while in shroud.","replies":[{"poster":"Prestige AkaIi","date":"2017-04-20T17:50:11.829+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Plus red trinket helps land those skillshots.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"HalcyonDweller","date":"2017-04-19T20:29:29.095+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sweeping trinkets will let you know her general position when in stealth.\n\nYou can get items that help you shield allies more. Knights Vow will take some of the damage for yourself. Other items that offer shields or heals are good choices too.\n\nHonestly its also up to your carries to itemize correctly against her. Lifesteal and damage reduction. Phantom Dancer and Death's Dance are good for this.\n\nAkali has to be locked down or peeled off very harshly to stop her in fights. Here are some things you can do for that:\n\n* Exhaust her when she reaches your carries.\n\n* With Taric you can ult as she dives onto your carry, then when the damage immunity wears off have your stun hit her.\n\n* With Alistar, space out your abilities to maximize how long you have her cc'd for. For example, knockup while charging your stun, then stun, then headbutt away when the stun wears off.\n\nIf you haven't tried it yet, I highly recommend trying out Maokai in the support role before they release his rework and take away the damage reduction ult. He's a fantastic support, and honestly I'm surprised more people don't play him there.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Handy Sandy ","date":"2017-04-19T20:28:39.396+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When equal, her burst is on the lower side of assassins unlike {{champion:55}} {{champion:105}} {{champion:7}} , but  she makes up for it by sticking around and coming at you a second or so later. It's best to counter this with cc and defensive items. Try kiting her, just make sure she doesn't jump to minions if you can by playing in the jg or when minions aren't at lanes. Just do your best to prevent her from snowballing and you're fine I guess.","replies":[]}]}
