Simply a matter of preference.  That's really all it comes down to.  Recent buffs to The Black Cleaver, Zz'rot Portal and his R have made him God-tier.  I wouldn't be surprised if we start to see him in professional play, although I hope that nobody actually picks him up.  I like that he's underrated and I would hate to see Riot nerf him.  \n\nIf you take a look at his kit, he has so much potential to become incredibly tanky while also having the same potential to do incredible damage.  People like to downplay his silence, but it's actually one of the most useful hard CC's in this game.  When you're silenced you can't flash, can't use abilities and you can't even use Thresh's lantern.  All you can do is run around and hope you don't die.  That silence is some of the best peel in this game.  Furthermore, since most of his damage is mobile you are able to keep up your damage almost 100% of the time.  Nobody can out-run you and it takes more than one (usually 3-4 if you build right) champions to lock you down because the passive resistances, damage reduction and CC reduction on your W is just so fucking good.  \n\nHe doesn't really have any glaring weaknesses since Patch 5.8.  I really like to run him in the top lane or in the jungle and use Smite with TP or Flash.  Challenging Smite/Cinderhulk, The Black Cleaver, Boots of Swiftness and Zz'Rot Portal are all so incredibly good on him.  He powerspikes hard after I get those first four fairly cheap items.  When I pick up Alacrity I can consistently keep over 600 MS while I'm running by a turret due to the Zz'Rot Portal passive and some other MS boosts.  Due to the passive on his W, he can get a total of 171 armor and magic resistance FROM ONLY TWO ITEMS, two points in the defensive tree and scaling seals/glyphs.  That doesn't even count his base armor and MR or the damage/cc reduction on his W active.  No other champion can boast these kind of stats.  \n\nI'm really happy with Garen.  Riot's new itemization has really allowed him to become one of a kind.","replies":[{"poster":"WillHealForHonor","date":"2015-05-12T15:06:51.102+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"why wouldnt u go ie or ghost blade on him","replies":[{"poster":"FirstSergeantBim","date":"2015-05-12T20:43:34.149+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't know.

If he goes tank, he is absolutely useless and is nothing but a silence and execute, his tankiness is only useful if he's focused... but his non-ult threat is an auto attack silence on a long cool down compared to other similar abilities... so there is never a reason to ever hit Garen in a team fight.

Unlike a lot of other bruisers, you can't load Garen down with four or five defensive items and expect him to churn out the damage. In fact, due to the passive on his W, you should be building one less defensive item on Garen compared to other bruisers since it makes up the difference.\n\nGaren isn't meant to be a tank. If you try to build him like a tank, he'll do no damage. The most he can do to peel and protect his squishies is silence someone, and his initiation is very poor. Garen is an anti-carry, which means instead of being the tank for your squishies, you jump the front line and start beating the hell out of theirs.
