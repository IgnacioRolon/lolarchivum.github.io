Out of 3 games, that means at least one would likely be dodged. And that's true for every person in a room. While I agree that one should not be punished for taking one for the team and dodging that autolock tryndamere who set his role as sup but says \"mid or feed,\" I don't think 1 free dodge out of 3 games for everyone is the best way to go about it, since more often than not it'll be used because someone was last pick but desperately wanted to play kog and threw a fit when first ban banned him. The queue takes long enough as-is without every game being a dodge","replies":[{"poster":"thats nice","date":"2016-03-03T18:10:34.589+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I see what you are saying, but how many times are you in a game with someone else that is also in their promos, i dont know about you, but for me its not very often and if other people are in their promos its usually only 1 person.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"My Waifu Vanilla","date":"2016-03-03T13:55:14.806+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"You already get a free win now to make up for any \"bad\" or \"troll\" game you would've gotten last season so this just seems unnecessary.","replies":[{"poster":"thats nice","date":"2016-03-03T18:11:43.804+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This kind of is irrelevant since you only get a free win, if you have been to the division that your trying to get to.

And it would end up in so much dodging and it's already frustrating when a game is about to start and someone dodges, so you have to spend another 5-6 minutes picking again. Almost every game you play, there is usually 1-3 people in promos. Now if you get one free dodge during promos, you might not even dodge because someone is trolling. You got outpicked and the other team got a good draft? Dodge. Person in promos doesn't like your team comp? Dodge. Your or another players champion gets banned?
