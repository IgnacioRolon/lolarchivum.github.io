Looks like from what you're describing, this is occurring when you have an enemy Super Galaxy Kindred in the game. I think you may be correct that this is something occurring due to FoW, or a particle pre-loading issue. I can follow up on this today and see what may be causing this. :)","replies":[{"poster":"Yasutsuna","date":"2016-06-20T20:15:44.894+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Would be nice if you could do that. \nSaw that bug happen today too but on Voyboy's stream the enemy Super Galaxy Kindred marked him came out of FoW he froze and then died because of it. \nI could add a Vod from his stream if it would help but overall would be nice if that skin gets disabled until its fixed :)","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-06-20T22:01:00.986+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"No need for the video, but I appreciate it. :) Unlike the Dark Star Thresh bug, this isn't affecting all users from our findings, seems to only be occurring with particular graphics cards; we're still looking into the issue. At this time, we aren't planning on disabling this skin.","replies":[{"poster":"Yasutsuna","date":"2016-06-21T18:24:38.774+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok then but i hope you guys can fix it somehow.\nbut its actually interesting that a bug occurs with particular graphic cards did something like that happen before ?","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-06-22T15:56:48.986+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We've had issues that have only been due to particular graphics cards, yes.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"GaleWinUnleashed","date":"2016-06-20T20:17:58.236+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Perhaps the underlying cause is similar to the bug with Dark Star Thresh?\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/1HvNiEO.png?noredirect","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-06-20T21:43:21.211+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nope - Thresh was something a bit different.
