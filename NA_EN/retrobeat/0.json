However, after returning home, I discovered that the mech store had given me a large instead. Now as a short asian male, I barely pass for a medium and am quite dissatisfied with this purchase as I distinctly remembered asking for a medium,  I know I should have checked the size at the purchase but I guess I just lost my head with the hype at worlds.\r\n\r\nIs there any way that I can return this sweatshirt and get one at the medium size without additional chrage (like mailing or something).  Cuz I really wanted this sweatshirt to be something for me to wear  :/\r\n\r\nPlease help, if I am to write this to a different forum or something, please tell me.\r\n\r\nThank You","replies":[{"poster":"EvilMerodach","date":"2016-10-31T13:34:39.988+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Add picture of you drowning in said shirt and sad kawaii face for bonus points.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-31T01:47:55.370+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh no, that really sucks!
