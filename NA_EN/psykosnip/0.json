Since you specifically mentioned there are limitations on your router, I recommend trying another router to see if it resolves this.\n\nLet me know if this causes any change.","replies":[{"poster":"Psykosnip","date":"2016-10-05T18:56:54.273+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I already said that with the phone i can log in normally into the game, so i think it's a VPN problem.
