On top of that, I used to get chests often, and keys were slower to get. Now it seems the other way around, with chests being almost impossible if you only play a couple champs.\r\n\r\nOn top of that, why do they even drop champion shards? You get those capsules that give guaranteed drops for champ shards, why do you need to bog down the hextech chests even more? You already get those (in my opinion) stupid emoticon things. \r\n\r\nI get that you guys want to encourage people to buy the skins and whatnot, but I mean holy shit does it seem impossible to get skins from them anymore.","replies":[]}
