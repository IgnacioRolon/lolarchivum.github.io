All this while being in easy access range of the enemy team. It puts her right into assassin's claws and slows down the speed with which she can burst someone since she needs to wait for the auto-attack projectile to land and detonate her passive before she can move to the next step of the rotation, and with how mobile and fast the game is right now this gives her enemies a significant window of opportunity to escape. Lux can rapidfire E-Q-E-R to burst faster but she misses out on a sizeable chunk of damage by only getting one proc of her passive (the one triggered by R before it re-applies the passive).\n\nI think the biggest change Lux needs is to have some damage shifted off of her passive and onto her spells. Possibly even have ALL of the damage shifted to her spells and be given a utility passive (damage amplification on targets her skills have granted her vision of, for example.)","replies":[{"poster":"MINJAH","date":"2015-06-01T17:52:16.407+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That would be a nice change, sort of like a leona passive could work to, and I would be happy with that.

I think she's okay right now, but has some problems that really hurt her.\n\n1) The passive is kinda awkward to use. Champions like Kat, Zed, Yasuo, etc with punish you extremely hard for getting into AA range. Even champions like Veigar or Annie can simple through a Q your way to get a pretty even trade. My idea for a change, would be to either speed up her AA animation along with giving her a little more AA range. OR, simple add the ability to reveal any champion that has her passive on them. Another fix would be allowing any spell Lux lands also proc the damage, basically like her ult already does. This would make Lux more of a chain-burst mage that focuses on landing several spells in a sequence. \n\n2) Her Q does not reveal champions. For a mage that is themed around the idea of Light, it makes little sense. While champions such as Morgana can just watch the projectile and see if it disappears, Lux's can hit two targets so unless there are two people in a bush that doesn't work.\n\n3) The shield is actually in a pretty good place, I would leave it as it is.\n\n4) The mana cost on E is just stupid. No one has a mana cost that high without some kind of mana return.\n\n5) Her ult is in a good spot. It does have a low cooldown with a huge range, but lower damage compared to other AP mages like Veigar and Xerath. It is one of the core parts of Lux that I would prefer stay as is.\n----\nI noticed that someone said \"Imagine if Ezreal and Jinx could fire their ults every 30 seconds.\"\n\nEzreal's ult has an 80 second CD.\nI get 40% CDR on both AP and AD Ezreal.\nThat puts his ult CD at 48 seconds.\nHis Q reduces all his CDs by 1 when it hits, including the Q cooldown/\nAt max CDR it has a 2.4 second CD, 1.4 if it hits.\n\nEvery 1.4 seconds Ezreal reduces his ult CD by 1.\nI can easily fire my ult every ~20 seconds.\nMuch faster than Lux, and has a higher AP scaling.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DirkTarTar","date":"2015-06-02T02:49:31.018+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"She is clunky and has dumb mana costs","replies":[]},{"poster":"Primadonna","date":"2015-06-02T00:23:47.097+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"She's pretty balanced right now, the only thing working against her is her big mana costs.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vier","date":"2015-06-02T07:27:57.399+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Please answer Riot you're ignoring all threads about Lux, I for one don't care about buffs I just wanna know that Riot's balance team actually remembers her.","replies":[]},{"poster":"xLyo","date":"2015-06-03T15:11:54.830+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i do not like passive. her passive is basically opposite for the rest of kit. she is ranged mage. rest of the kit is okay. if you dodge q, you easily will dodge her e. her ult is visible before detonating so you can dodge it as well. she is okay. :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"misfortunas","date":"2015-06-03T12:12:46.788+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can't stand her, but I think she is okay...

She has some pretty obvious strengths and weaknesses - amazing utility with all her CC, AoE shield, and an amazing low cooldown ult, but relatively long early cooldowns, high mana costs, highly immobile and a clunky passive.\n\nI think the biggest issue I have with Lux is that everyone single one of her skills requires her to stop moving in order to cast and for a mage who’s already immobile in the first place, this is a huge crutch. She has no effective way of getting away and her shield is useless when she’s being chased (mostly due to the small amount it shields her, for the long time she has to stand still to cast it). Basically, she has very unreliable disengage and positioning is HUGE for her.\n\nMy other issue is with her passive is practically useless out of the laning phase. I think it should either be able to be procc’ed by allies or at least do something more, like grant true vision. She technically shouldn’t ever be in range to proc a passive with an AA in teamfights, but that’s also a huge chunk of her damage gone.\n\nI think Lux is just in general, a little outdated. I don’t think her kit needs a rework, she just needs small tweaks like updating mana costs, etc. She’s not played as often simply because there are other champs who are so much easier to play in terms of positioning and give much less migraines when it comes to mana.\n\nAlso, support Lux has 2 issues - mana and her ult. She’s too much of a mana whore to be effective in bot lane and her ult brings no utility to the team. Her AoE shield is cool, but the 35% AP scaling isn’t all that great, especially compared to Janna’s Eye of the Storm which gives you 240 health (which is 60 health more than Lux’s) +70% AP scaling and an AD buff (or even Karma’s shield). (Yes, Lux’s shield is AoE, but we all know how our teammates all turn into Faker whenever we try to shield them.)

Which is 1.2 mana per second.
