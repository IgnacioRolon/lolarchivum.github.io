I was just wondering if this skin for Diana could have a little color change in the abilities. Dark Valkyrie Diana&#039;s changes are so big that I personally think it is better, while Lunar Revel Diana&#039;s color is a very light pink, almost the same as the white. Just wondering if their could be a bit more pink in there, darken it up or something alike.\n\nThank you!","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-07-01T16:25:16.459+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey Stamporion,\n\nThanks for taking the team to leave feedback regarding content! \n\nWhile I agree that there are some slight similarities between Base Diana and Lunar Goddess Diana, I think all of her skins have their own thematics.\n\nThe Lunar Goddess Diana was a skin made for the Lunar Revel event, which is is why it has a cherry blossom/floral accents in all of her skills.

It might be a nice candidate for a chroma. Would love it with more pink and maybe a different hair color (like blonde or magenta)","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-07-01T16:33:25.484+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd agree with that.

They are 975 skins, yet you can hardly notice a difference in any skin. However, the color change in Dark Valkyrie is more noticeable. Lunar Goddess looks pretty much the same as the base skin. So if she's not going to get a new, good skin, at least spice up the old ones to be worth 975.","replies":[]}]}
