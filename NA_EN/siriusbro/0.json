I know you're concerned because it's about a day before the [stated time](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/RlNQkO39-buying-runes-between-now-and-preseason), but hang tight.  We're still far off from runes reforged!  Give us some time for the process to begin first, and who knows if anything changes between now and then.  Should you not receive one after we've begun refunding them, hit us up in a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and we'll see if there's anything we can do.","replies":[{"poster":"SiriusBro","date":"2017-07-23T11:33:13.912+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"oh okay thanks for the reply Porocles!","replies":[]}]}]}
