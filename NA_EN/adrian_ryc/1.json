Did you actually do any bug fixes for Azir last patch like you said you did?","subforum":"Report a Bug","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Three times last game it showed my ultimate off cool down. When I tried to use it, it says it's on cool down. \n\nHis Q ability shows that it's off cool down. I try to use it, it tells me it's on cool down.\n\nHis W shows me having 2 soldiers. It only lets me cast 1 soldier even.\n\nSoldier's still don't attack sometimes when they're in attack stance.\n\nAzir can be a really good champion if you actually take the time and fix his bugs. Feels like you didn't fix anything last patch like you said you did.","replies":[{"poster":"devastation inc","date":"2014-10-20T02:11:25.902+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"they really did fix a lot of problems hes a lot more smooth than he used to be but yes i feel there are still some problems","replies":[]},{"poster":"X SkeletonCandy","date":"2014-10-20T02:09:21.276+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yep, I've had all of these problems today. He's without a doubt the most buggy champ ever, but he's so awesome and I won't let his many bugs stop me from playing him.","replies":[{"poster":"Elysian Nova","date":"2014-10-21T12:20:22.498+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"All in all hes a total badass. People in ranked have called me trash and to stop trolling because they see me pick azir. Apparently they love to assume all who play azir are bad but i tend to prove them wrong. Still has some bugs but i overlook them and play anyways.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Makebelievee","date":"2014-10-20T17:24:52.668+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This problem is occurring alot, when I use my R it does not show a CD timer, Hella confusing when a teamfight happens. Same thing with my W, it'll show that I can place a solider but when I try to its still on CD.

I get that with Shifting sands too. If I try to cast W and immediately E, I get an unavailable sound sometimes, other times I get a simple cast sound but nothing happens. I cant rely on my E at all as Azir, and I pray every time I have to ult mid battle.\nHe's awesome alright, but the gameplay with the bugs is quite an unfair match and very detrimenting to the experience. If only he worked as intended all Azir fans would be in pure bliss when  you get {{item:3115}} {{item:3029}} {{item:3089}}","replies":[]}]}
