Every single person that downloads League has a client that comes with a language filter activated. There is not one single person who has been offended by my chats that did not consent to seeing those chats. \r\n\r\nSo why am I losing an account with every single champion unlocked, 14 rune pages, every single rune unlocked and over 90 skins bought with 520k ip sitting there because of words that people had to actively allow to even see them?","replies":[]}
