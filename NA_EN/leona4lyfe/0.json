Good bye.\n\nIt doesn't matter as long as it's between 0 and 1.\nFluctuation doesn't matter for averages.\n\nBut fine here's your rigorous proof:\np = chance for a player being a troll (this can be presumed to be a static chance, since the playerbase is large enough)\nP(X|A) = chance for X trolls in allied team\nP(X|E) = chance for X trolls in enemy team\nEA = Expectation value of trolls for allied team\nEE = Expecttation value for trolls on the enemy team.\n\n(1 - p = chance for a player **not** being a troll\nchance for you to be a troll is presumed to be 0)\n\nThe expectation value for the amount of trolls then would be the sum of the values of each event (e.g. 3 for 3 trolls) multiplied with the chance of that event happening.\n\n------------\n\nEA = 0&#42;P(0|A) + 1&#42;P(1|A) + 2&#42;P(2|A) + 3&#42;P(3|A) + 4*&#42;P(4|A) + 5&#42;P(5|A)\n\nSince there is a 0% chance for five trolls on your team (you are not a troll) we can simplify this to:\n\nEA = P(1|A) + 2&#42;P(2|A) + 3&#42;P(3|A) + 4&#42;P(4|A)\n\n------------------\n\nEE = 0&#42;P(0|E) + 1&#42;P(1|E) + 2&#42;P(2|E) + 3&#42;P(3|E) + 4&#42;P(4|E) + 5&#42;P(5|E)\n\nThis time there is a chance for five trolls, but we can still simplify it to\n\nEA = P(1|E) + 2&#42;P(2|E) + 3&#42;P(3|E) + 4*&#42;P(4|E) + 5&#42;P(5|E)\n\n----------------\n\nNow, since we have a binomial distribution (each player can either be a troll or not, with the same chance; except for you with the chance being zero) we can conclude that the chances are:\n\nP(X|A) = binom(4, X) &#42; (1-p)^(4-X)  &#42; p^X\nP(X|E) = binom(5, X) &#42; (1-p)^(5-X)  &#42; p^X\n\nor specifically:\n\nP(1|A) = 4 &#42; (1-p)^3 &#42; p\nP(1|E) = 5 &#42; (1-p)^4  &#42;  p\n=> P(1|E) = 5/4 &#42; (1-p) &#42; P(1|A)\n\nP(2|A) = 6 &#42; (1-p)^2 &#42; p^2\nP(2|E) = 10  &#42; (1-p)^3 &#42; p^2\n=> P(2|E) = 10/6 &#42; (1-p) &#42; P(2|A) = 5/3 &#42; (1-p) &#42; P(2|A)\n\nP(3|A) = 4 &#42; (1-p)^1 &#42; p^3\nP(3|E) = 10  &#42; (1-p)^2 &#42; p^3\n=> P(3|E) = 10/4 &#42; (1-p) &#42; P(3|A) = 5/2 &#42; (1-p) &#42; P(3|A)\n\nP(4|A) = 1 &#42; (1-p)^0 &#42; p^4\nP(4|E) = 5 &#42; (1-p)^1 &#42; p^4\n=> P(4|E) = 5/1 &#42; (1-p) &#42; P(4|A) = 5 &#42; (1-p) &#42; P(4|A)\n\nP(5|A) = 0\nP(5|E) = 1 &#42; (1-p)^0 &#42; p^5\n\n------------------------\n\nThat means the expectation values are:\n\nEA = 4 &#42; (1-p)^3 &#42; p + 12 &#42; (1-p)^2 &#42; p^2 + 12 &#42; (1-p)^1 &#42; p^3+ 4 &#42; (1-p)^0 &#42; p^4\n\nand\n\nEE = 5 &#42; (1-p)^4  &#42;  p + 20  &#42; (1-p)^3 &#42; p^2 + 30  &#42; (1-p)^2 &#42; p^3 + 20 &#42; (1-p)^1 &#42; p^4 + 5 &#42; p^5\n\nNow let's take a look at the difference:\n\nEE - EA = 5 &#42; (1-p)^4  &#42;  p + 20  &#42; (1-p)^3 &#42; p^2 + 30  &#42; (1-p)^2 &#42; p^3 + 20 &#42; (1-p)^1 &#42; p^4 + 5 &#42; p^5 - (4 &#42; (1-p)^3 &#42; p + 12 &#42; (1-p)^2 &#42; p^2 + 12 &#42; (1-p)^1 &#42; p^3+ 4 &#42; (1-p)^0 &#42; p^4)\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nNow rather than showing you rigorous proof of why that is larger than zero, click the following link on Wolfram alpha in which you can check for yourself the values of this equation for values for p between 0 and 1 (aka 0% and 100%)\n\nhttp://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=5+*+(1-p)%5E4+*+p+%2B+20+*+(1-p)%5E3+*+p%5E2+%2B+30+*+(1-p)%5E2+*+p%5E3+%2B+20+*+(1-p)%5E1+*+p%5E4+%2B+5+*+p%5E5+-+(4+*+(1-p)%5E3+*+p+%2B+12+*+(1-p)%5E2+*+p%5E2+%2B+12+*+(1-p)%5E1+*+p%5E3%2B+4+*+(1-p)%5E0+*+p%5E4)+from+0+to+1\n\nNo matter the value for p (which is the value you accuse me of not knowing) EE-EA is positive, which means that EE is larger than EA.\n\nQ E fucking D","replies":[]},{"poster":"TrulyBland","date":"2017-07-11T17:33:30.154+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=leona4lyfe,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=aNcIbux3,comment-id=00020001000000000000000000000000000000010000000000010001,timestamp=2017-07-11T16:23:00.072+0000)\n>\n> Can I see those numbers?

Let's pretend that checking the stats only takes 5 seconds per report, and that includes loading times and double checking different sources to prevent false positives.\n\nhttps://www.riotgames.com/articles/20140711/1322/league-players-reach-new-heights-2014\nLet's assume: 1. that the number of players is the same as it was in 2014 (probably more now), 2. the 27 million people who play every day only encounter 1 troll per week (massive understatement), and 3. only the people that play every day have trolls in their games (unrealistic).\nThat's 3.8 million trolls every day, 160 thousand trolls per hour, 2600 trolls per minute, or 44 trolls per second.\n\nMake sure you perform due diligence on every report.\n\nAnd remember to enjoy your new 37,500 hour per week job.","replies":[{"poster":"leona4lyfe","date":"2017-07-11T01:06:11.865+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"If that many people visit the site, I can just hire people to help me.\n\nI've told people about it.

You said in another comment that you'd watch a replay, so let's increase the time estimate to 20 minutes each. With that minor modification, you now need 225,000 employees at the lowest level, directly dealing with the reports. This is still with the massive underestimation of one troll per week, with only the daily players encountering any trolls.\n\nAnd in other posts you were talking about checking frequency of infractions, intensity of infractions, and having duration of an account's stay on the list being determined from that. That would increase the workload.\n\nBut then, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Span_of_control you have to start worrying a little bit about managing your employees. They have to set quotas, monitor quality of decisions, have meetings to distribute any new things your system identifies as toxic, mediate disputes, ect ect. So, let's say your employees are almost perfect, so you can have a 50:1 ratio of employees to managers. That is: 4500 first level managers, 90 second level managers, 2 top level managers that report directly to you. That's a lot of people.\n\nIn fact, you'd be the 24th largest employer (global number of employees) in America https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_employers_in_the_United_States\n\nWhere's your income going to come from?","replies":[{"poster":"leona4lyfe","date":"2017-07-11T04:08:22.874+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Won't need that many employees if done right.\n\nUm.

Give me some numbers to work with here. How long are you going to take on each report? Be sure to include data transfer, loading, checking multiple sources, making the decision, applying the decision, everything else you can think of.\n------\n\nAt a scale of 44 reports per second, you should pay close attention to how many clicks it takes your employees to deal with a report and how far away the different options are from each other. Carpal tunnel could become a large expense for your company.\n\nIf you've ever been near a monotonous job, you know that doing very repetitive things for long periods of time is very draining. How many breaks will you provide your workers? Productivity and accuracy go down pretty fast for unmotivated people. \n\nOnce again, I'll bring up that you said you'd watch replays. You'd be using more bandwidth than Netflix. To get even 10Gps requires a personal consultation to see if that's even FEASIBLE for a given location, and they don't even list a price. (comcast business class)\n\nWhat are your plans for dealing with name changes? Can your system handle the special characters allowed in Summoner Names to accurately flag the correct account? How extensive is your translation team? Remember that multi-lingual people are very expensive to hire.\n---------\nLoLKing stays alive from donations and ads. But they're a pretty passive operation. They occasionally pull data from Riot's servers and arrange it nicely. That's something that takes very few personnel compared to what you're trying to do.\n-------\nI'm not trying to stop you.
