They had all 5 members there and bought items. There was a fight right away and a member of each team died. \r\n\r\nI didn't think the early surrender options worked if you killed a champ or everyone was there to buy items.\r\n\r\nYou would think there would be a place to see the rules for this but after looking all i find are boards with people complaining and suggesting ways to change surrender or get rid of it or make it easier...... \r\n\r\nwhy do we not have a page that has all the rules, chat commands, and everything else that is build into the client.....\r\n\r\nMulti billion dollar company and they probably hired the bosses cousins son who knows computers to build their site....","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-14T20:55:48.951+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there, we do have these resources available in our support site:\n\n[Chat commands\n](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752704-Chat-Commands)\n\n[Remake](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/208754686--Remake-FAQ)\n\n\nIt looks like your last match ended early due to a /remake because someone on your other team was marked as a leaver.
