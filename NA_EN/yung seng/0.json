And this results to the photo from link. \r\nI talked to Riot support last year and they said that is from my internet connection(package loss). I pinged to EUNE server from cmd and I saw 0% package loss.The thing is that everything is working... literally everything (no lags,no spikes,no nothing. Browser also working perfectly)... but this Accept/Decline option never shows up. it's like delay of 10-15 secs that is enough time to finish queue and not accept. \r\nI am using ethernet connection. My router is really old (GR-534W) and my internet is the same like before. I've been using it for years and in that time League client was working perfectly!\r\nI really don't know where problem come from. If someone can help would be nice! \r\nThanks for your time reading this! Enjoy your day :)","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-02-02T02:10:10.946+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It does kind of sound like it's probably a connection based problem off the top of my head, but let's dig into this! If you don't mind, run a traceroute using something like [WinMTR](http://winmtr.net/winmtr-v0-92-now-available/) to the EUNE servers at 31.186.224.42, and post those results here so I can take a look. Be sure to block out the very top line, since that's a bit of personal info!","replies":[{"poster":"Yung Seng","date":"2018-02-02T12:29:10.170+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello Broporo!\n\nThanks for your assist about my problem. \nHere is the results from Winmtr application:\nhttps://imgur.com/a/ns3Dr\n\nHave a nice day!","replies":[{"poster":"Yung Seng","date":"2018-02-02T12:37:20.928+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm this just show up after I let it to ping for some time.\nhttps://imgur.com/a/Jdzto\n\nAnd that server (ip-1-138.tcv.bg) must be the internet provider one because that is the name of the company (TCV)\n\nSo in summary I should talk to them and fix it somehow?","replies":[]}]}]}]}
