First, we'll focus on the more emergent of the two- your disconnections from champ select. Most issues in champ select are caused by drops in your connection to the matchmaking service since champ select heavily relies on a really steady connection, especially in any sort of draft mode. \n\nIncompatible network settings that prevent a good link from happening are the most common cause of issues such as this, so I encourage you to work through our [connection guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) as a first step in resolving this problem.\n\nLet me know if that guide provided any noticeable results.","replies":[]}]}
