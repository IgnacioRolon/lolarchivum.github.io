The first steps I suggest taking can be found over in our [**Connection KB**](http://riot.com/12B7oac); there are a lot of steps but each one can help eliminate one potential cause or get a fix for the download speeds.\n\nI'd also suggest making sure there are no settings on your router limiting its speeds either. Another player I helped recently had a similar problem, and once he changed the limiter the speeds went back to normal. If you don't know how to do that, or if the Connection Guide doesn't help, let Tech Support help troubleshoot those speeds [**in a ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new). They have a lot of in depth steps you can try in private with them. :)","replies":[]}]}
