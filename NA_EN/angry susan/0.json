It seems that your network is having an issue maintaining a stable connection with the game server.  It's getting through because you aren't disconnecting, but it's certainly delayed.  As a first step, I'd suggest running a [log reader ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743-Connection-Troubleshooting-Log-Reader)which can help diagnose what's going wrong with your connection.  The results will also provide some steps to take specific for your issue.  Let me know what you come up with, or if you run into any issues!","replies":[]}]}
