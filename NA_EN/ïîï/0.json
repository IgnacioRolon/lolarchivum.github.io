I don't care about URF mode, so spending time and money to make URF mode work for this patch, drawing players from ascension, does not make me feel better over Azir being disabled.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Silverclaw","date":"2014-09-18T16:45:22.702+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"I don't like [X] so bring back URF as compensation\" is:\n\nA) SUPER ENTITLED\nB) Even if it DID come back, it would be super glitchy and buggy because they wouldn't have worked on it for the time they needed to.\nC) Really silly as it will come back eventually\nD) Really stupid because after a week it became \"play OP things or be raged at\" just like yoloq.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Silverclaw","date":"2014-09-18T16:46:43.314+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You don't realize how much time it takes to actually MAKE things for the community, do you?
