It's visibility that's the issue. Imagine a Twitch skin that's 255, 0, 0 everywhere (bright red). Would give you instant visibility on him in a teamfight when he pops out of invisibility.\n\n{{champion:51}}","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2017-01-03T22:59:53.304+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Riot's official stance is that it's only forbidden if it either gives you advantages in any way or allows you to use Riot's skins that you don't own.
