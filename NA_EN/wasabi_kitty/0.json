It&#039;s not to go smoke a cigarette. \r\n\r\nThe amount of people in silver that just load in, buy items and then afk under tower for 2 minutes is fucking obscene.\r\n\r\nIf you&#039;re in silver you can win every fucking game if you can get all 5 of your teammates to invade the enemy bot side at the start of the game. Hell you don&#039;t even need 5 you can do it with 3 or 4 because the enemy top and mid are going to be sitting afk making a sandwich. The enemy jungle/adc/support are probably afk in the bush near the bot side buff. Of course pulling this off will be very difficult because your team will also be afk under tower/in jungle.","replies":[{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2017-10-03T06:35:20.317+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You'd be better off saying \"Dear all players\"\n\nsince it happens just as much in higher elos.","replies":[]}]}
