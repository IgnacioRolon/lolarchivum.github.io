That's comprised in the words \"alpha testing\", btw.\nI was able to pick a lot of different champions with varying degrees of success, but never felt as if one champion's capabilities were undesirable. I carried, was carried, and was wrecked by about every champion of the roster, in both lane and jungle, except perhaps the less popular ones such as Annie, Aurelion Sol, Azir... but that's just my not seeing them often, I suppose.","replies":[]}]}]}
