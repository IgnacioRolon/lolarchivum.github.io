Because Ahri can use the most broken Keystone which is Electrocute and Ignite , Ahri can run from ganks and stuff whenever she has Ult , Lux and most of immobile mages can't , that's why Ahri is in better place\nBUT ,  does that mean Ahri is broken? no , that means she is in a good place , nothing more , and she isn't like Zed who misses everything and still kills , Ahri MUST hit her charm to kill , unless she is ahead then that team she must hit both of her Q's.\n\nAnd don't forget , Ahri is a champion that stays behind when gets behind , she is like other mages , she can be 3/0 in lane , Kill a Fizz or Zed or Talon 3 times , they can still come back and kill you , the exact same problem mages have.\n\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"wildfox99","date":"2018-08-15T15:47:05.466+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"> Who and what do they give up? {{champion:103}} {{champion:238}} {{champion:157}} give up nothing.
