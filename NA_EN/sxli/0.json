I picked a role and stuck to it, working on all the ins and outs of it. I picked adc because I enjoy the role and can carry decently from there. I regularly practice cs`ing and positioning so I don`t die but can still put out a lot of damage and help out in fights. I ward pretty often, so even if my support doesn`t, we have good vision of the map. \r\n\r\nI`ve managed to climb up to my promos for  bronze 4 for the 6 or 7th time and  today, immediately first pick goes &quot;feed or feed&quot; and locks in blitz, we all try to joke around, not really thinking he`s gonna feed, (I was soo beyond wrong). Poppy and blitz kept trying too 1v5 and raged a lot. But I tried to focus on things I could do to help. I got gangplank fed and he did pretty well and me and him were able to do a little, but it wasn`t enough.\r\n\r\nI lost the game, and partially that was to being caught out twice. I know I could have positioned better. and cs`d and ect.\r\n\r\n I`m so very tired of being in bronze, I don`t want to be stuck here. I don`t believe in elo hell, and I know there has to be something I can do to get out of here. Any advice or help would be appreciated. I need to win these next two promos.","replies":[{"poster":"Phreak","date":"2015-07-13T05:12:36.371+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":2,"body":"I would say there are 3 big things:\n\n1.

Either upgrade to the better yellow and help with warding, switch to blue(I like upgraded blue, but blue is the only reasonable trinket to not upgrade, but only get on ADCs) or get red(upgraded red helps duel against stealth targets).  If you look at my ranked history, I have at least a 90% trinket upgrade rate, and at least half of my unupgraded trinkets are games where it simply ended right around level 9-10, and thus, upgrading wasn't really an available option.\n\n3.In your last ranked game, you bought Pickaxe+BFS instead of LW.  This is a flatout mistake.\n\n4.You overpriotize BT+IE over BT+LW or IE+LW in your 3 items + boots build.   Its sometimes worth building IE+BT, but not as often as you seem to do so.  Generally, the rule of thumbs about this are to build a BFS-item(BoRK counts on some ADCs as a BT alternative) into a Zeal-item-equivalent(Ghostblade counts) into a LW into either your other BFS item or a defense item into whichever you didn't buy fourth.  Triforce carries work roughly the same way, but go Zeal->BFS->LW instead, counting Triforce as a zeal-item.  Corki, Kalista and Ezreal are just weird, but they'll at least function reasonably utilizing these builds even if they're better built other ways.\n\n5.Don't build sunfire cape on supports unless you've built Randuin's and Frozen Heart already and still need an HP/Armor combo-item.  And even then, you should probably build Ohmwrecker instead.\n\n6.Your last Thresh game, you're sitting on Relic Shield all game with a sightstone.  Dude, buy Face of the Mountain.  Its really good, really cheap, and helps your gold income.\n\n7.Play fewer champions in ranked.  You're more eclectic than I am, but you've got less than 400-500 games played, ever, compared to my ~5000.  You simply don't have the experience to afford that level of variety.  Trim the list and focus on a few champions that you enjoy playing, and play them as exclusively as you can in their roles.","replies":[{"poster":"Sxli","date":"2015-07-13T17:36:12.373+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the response.\n\nI do forget to upgrade my trinket fairly often so I wrote a note and have placed it on the corner of my screen.

In the worst case, a level 18 Caitlyn with IE and AD runes will get roughly the same damage increase as buying BT, but for a 1200g discount.  Buying vamp scepter doesn't change this calculation of DPS priority.  Literally the only reason to buy BT over LW 3rd item is if you *NEED* the shield.  That worst case is an Orianna with no armor runes and without her own ball at level 18.

I would actually watch you play and help more, but I don't even have time to play myself lately. when I get some free time, I might help you more, but that might not be happening for a few days still. \n\nanother thing you can do is watch high ranked streamers and compare what they do with what you do and try to spot their mistakes and why they do what they do. basically study their playing.","replies":[{"poster":"Sxli","date":"2015-07-13T05:52:16.037+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I tried just keeping bot lane warded (game I just recorded) and it worked wonders.

(if you max Q, it's often best to get IE first item since Q damage goes well with it.)\n\nwhile laning, you want to look for when other laners walk too close or too far up into your minion wave and poke them down. unless they have a very strong advantage, your poke without taking minion aggro vs their poke with them taking minions aggro will often make you even or win the trade. \n\ntry to rush to level 2 before the other laners. if they get level 2 first, often they can abuse you hard in lane, but if you get it first, it makes for a much safer early game laning phase.","replies":[{"poster":"Sxli","date":"2015-07-13T03:31:13.114+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I generally rush bork + boots then ie.

She's known as being a immobile ADC. Jinx requires a lot of positioning in order to keep herself safe because if someone jumps on her it's hard to do much about it. Her range is good though so it is possible to poke from range as long as you mind your spacing. Also, I might be the only one but I prefer maxing W on vayne.
