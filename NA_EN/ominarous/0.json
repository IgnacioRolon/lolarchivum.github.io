You now have 100% crit (and infinity edge passive). Yasuo&#039;s Q does not apply infinity edge passive. You can tell by the damage it deals relative to your autos. It should do more damage than your autos by a solid amount, but it does not. Notice how his Q says it applies on hit effects and obviously can crit. His Q should apply infinity edge passive, but IT DOES NOT.","replies":[{"poster":"Void Nargacuga","date":"2017-01-06T04:07:10.428+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"You may want to read this part of his passive.\n\n> [League of Legends Wikia {{champion:157}} ](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Yasuo)\n\n> INTENT: Yasuo's critical strike chance is doubled, but his critical strikes deal 90% damage, reduced to 75% damage on Steel Tempest.","replies":[{"poster":"Ominarous","date":"2017-01-06T17:45:19.097+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I understand that.

Yasuo's Autoattacks deal *1.9 crit damage instead of *2.0, and his Q deals *1.75. This means that once you get enough AD to offset the Q's bonus damage, your autoattacks will outscale it.\n\nHell, because of the multiplicative nature of the Infinity Edge passive, the damage gap gets even more noticable. The AD you get from inherent scaling, IE, and a BT will just about get you to the threshold.","replies":[{"poster":"Ominarous","date":"2017-01-07T01:06:39.660+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Almost positive that isn't mentioned in his kit at all.
