Thats a huge gap of experience, and it shows, the games are just not fun. No matter what I do or try to defend my teammates they just keep getting rekt. It even happens all the time when I get matched by myself\n\nIt seems like its because the experienced players are grouping with smurf accounts or their new friends, which causes them to be matched against 5 new players, meanwhile 2 of them are really experienced.\n\nHere is a picture that shows the win differences\n\nhttp://prntscr.com/68686o\n\nI dont understand why this is the way it is I mean I understand one game in a while but lately its like 3 out of 4 games are unbalanced like this, my teammates are all noobs while the enemies have multiple players who have been playing 1-2 years\n\nDoes the game have like virtually no matchmaking system at all for non ranked games? I dont like the pressure from always worrying about my rank, I like to play normal games but this system just seems like it matches anybody with anybody without a care in the world which to me shows lazy dev work and not any effort at all for offering newer players a good experience...","replies":[{"poster":"Thefriendlyorc","date":"2015-02-22T19:00:37.300+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even as a silver player I get matchmaking against plats and sometimes diamonds nearly on an everyday basis.

This means the matchmaking tried to find a match between the skill levels (with the levels being S5 and a probably bad lvl 8). As such, it figured level 19-20 people would be the average and matched them vs you.\n\nAs a side note, this is why queueing with lower skilled people is unfun for the other team.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ProcrastinatorL","date":"2015-02-22T18:26:06.868+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeah, the matchmaking is pretty much totally broken.

This is an issue that I would think should be fixed within a few months from release, I just think of the countless poor souls who had bad experiences over the years from this terrible matchmaking \n\nIt doesnt even seem that complicated to fix, just add an extra few lines of code to prevent a team with a certain number of wins to be matched against a certain number of wins, What I think the reason aside from laziness is that Riot doesnt want to have longer que times, but that is a bad choice. I would much rather have to wait a few extra minutes for better quality games","replies":[]}]}
