Why'd you let him free farm?\"","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":9,"down_votes":7,"body":"//startrant\r\n\r\n{{champion:75}} \r\n\r\n1.) Nasus is gonna farm anyways.\r\n2.) Your top laner is not gonna be able to control the Sustain Monster known as Nasus who infinitely scales in damage and just builds tank aside from Trinity Force or Gauntlet.\r\n3.) Letting him splitpush won&#039;t solve anything.\r\n4.) Give your top laner some love, mid can roam and gank and jungle can gank aswell.\r\n\r\nOkay so here&#039;s the story behind my game. I picked Olaf into Nasus and I was denying Nasus so hard in the early game, he could barely get 40 stacks before level 7 or so and I was happy, but I had no kill or assist up on him. Eventually our lane starts to even out as he starts to hit 50 stacks, then 60, then 80, then 100, and it spirals from there. I&#039;ve played so many games as Nasus and VS Nasus and I can&#039;t believe people don&#039;t get the hint that your top laner alone WILL NOT be able to deny Nasus for the ENTIRE game. One game as Nasus I went from 0/1 with 50 stacks at level 6 to 5/2 210 stacks in a period of about 15 minutes because I walked into lane and split pushed and farmed. If my opponent was also in lane, I just popped wither/ghost and everything and if I needed to, I&#039;d ult, and I&#039;d kill them everytime because they don&#039;t have the upper damage advantage due to their team being ignorant and ignoring Nasus and letting him stick his Snoop Dogg in your top laner&#039;s asshole.\r\n\r\nOkay anyways back to my game, we lost, ofcourse. The Nasus ended up with 1k stacks at 50 minutes or so and all he did was 2 shot my ADC because our support was clueless and our jungler was oblivious until the blame game started. &quot;Olaf why&#039;d you let Nasus free farm?&quot; &quot;my god 400 stacks, this is why I go top instead.&quot; &quot;olaf you&#039;re absolute shit at this game, who lets nasus free farm?&quot; I kept my cool all game, I just said &quot;Nobody can hold Nasus alone forever.&quot; and simply muted the rest of my team and went on to keep trying but lost in the end. I ended the game with a score 11/7/8 and 419 CS and it lasted 58 minutes and 56 seconds. I about carried but my team was so apeshit bent on going in 1v5 one after another that-- I don&#039;t even know anymore.\r\n\r\n/endrant","replies":[{"poster":"BastionKross","date":"2015-06-14T12:15:22.441+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lower leagues have a problem with finishing games. A lot of players will win a teamfight or gain an advantage, and then don't take objectives like dragon or towers afterward. There's little point in winning a teamfight if directly afterward your whole team recalls and/or starts to wander aimlessly in the jungle until the other team comes back. They don't know how to correctly press an advantage.\n\nThis is absolutely perfect for champions who get better the longer the game goes on. Nasus is one of the safest and easiest of those champions to play, and so he's the champion that gets picked the most of that group. When you play against Nasus or any of those champions, your whole team should agree that the game should be won no later than 35 minutes. Don't be afraid to ping objectives after teamfights or getting a pick. End the game as quickly as possible.\n\nYou can delay Nasus from getting big by denying him early; but unless you spend the whole game on his ass, he's eventually going to scale and become the monster that 1v5s the team. It is in your best interest to never give him the opportunity to reach that level by finishing the match before that time.","replies":[{"poster":"KidKaiser","date":"2015-06-14T20:53:19.396+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"but the thing about pinging an objective is.\n\n\"BUT IM TOO LOW\" says the 20% hp ADC.\n70% hp Alistar leading the charge.\nand lets say you are da jungle Amumu sitting at 40% hp.\n\nu guys just got done with a teamfight win in your favor. 2 of your teammates are down. and 3.

Even if not until 40 minutes, but at least by that point he'll shit on your squishies and ctrl+4 all day while he solos towers to victory. That's just Nasus. If he could be denied every time and be useless by a certain point, I think he'd be worse than Kassadin, because he's pretty much the same way, farm up and be awesome or don't and be completely useless.

A lot of the times when I play Kassadin I only ALMOST take one, even, not even get a kill. And worse, pre-11 he can only ult every 5 secs, meaning he can get one kill then unless its 1v1, probably die. Even late game with full CDR its only every 1.6 seconds, still enough to CC kill him before he can get away, or heck, just burst him. Pretty sure Nidalee's dash is on the same cooldown as Kassadin's ult pre-11.\n\nAnd, most assassins at the moment can take care of more than one person({{champion:76}} {{champion:55}} {{champion:157}}), as Kassadin can only take one with a little bit of AOE from his E and R. Not only can those other champs contribute more than one kill, they also have lots of multi-target and AOE abilities, meaning even without bursting someone they're still damaging them.","replies":[{"poster":"Lugg","date":"2015-06-15T00:09:54.966+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can't argue that he is weak compared to other assassins, but that is because they are OP.

Frozen Heart, Randuins, and Thornmail would be better choices for armour IMO. In general, I usually get armour on Olaf against Nasus and rely on my base damages to beat him up early on.

That's a long game. The teams problem was letting the game get to that point. The fact that it took that long to get to 1k stacks meant that you denied him pretty good. \n\nNasus is by no means without weakness. His primary strength is Split pushing because of a) the free farm, and b) his Q is great at taking towers. Where he lacks is the Team fight. He only has his Wither for CC and can't stop you from diving carries. The Only mistake you probably made was that Nasus ate your attention for too long. Grouping with the team and engaging a 5v4 would probably have been a better move.  Win the team fights, and turn them into Objectives. I would guaranty that the Nasus player would start complaining about his team feeding because they can't stall the game until he's fed.\n\nTo that end, I would probably say that a good counter to Nasus would be a good initiator that can start team fights and make him uncomfortable.
