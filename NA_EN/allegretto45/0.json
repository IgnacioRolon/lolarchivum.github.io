If your 14-day suspension was 3-4 months ago, that means your behavior hasn't improved enough to warrant the punishment tiers dropping. \n\n A 14-day suspension is also the final straw for an account, meaning it would take less to get a permanent suspension at that point.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2020-01-28T04:38:46.192+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Calling for reports is harassment, \"go next\" and \"open mid\" are giving up, \"mid gap\" is harassment, you spend most of your time in chat arguing.

How is saying mid gap harassment he's stating which lane lost and why there losing the game.\n\nOP had a 14-day suspension a few months ago. After such a punishment, the next offense - whatever it may be, from racial slurs to passive-aggressive nagging - is a permaban. Saying \"mid gap\" is harassment against your mid laner, because it means that they're worse than their opponent. OP also talked about adding a teammate to an \"int list,\" meaning to watch for that player and intentionally feed in their games. Yes, stating that you've given up is considered \"giving up\" (duh) which has a long history of being [unacceptable behavior](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-n5l_I7-xGVc/ViAj7B0oChI/AAAAAAAAy3E/TqkUwifYPNI/s1600/78678.jpg). \"Stating which lane lost\" accomplishes nothing other than making that laner feel bad.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"AeroWaffle","date":"2020-01-28T03:47:01.957+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Honestly, I would be fine with a punishment from these two lines alone because of the behavior that they're endorsing;\n\nAllegretto45: make sure to put ekko on ur int lists\nAllegretto45: keep him in piss low elo","replies":[{"poster":"Allegretto45","date":"2020-01-28T03:51:53.345+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"FOr some context he jumped in champ select and first thing he said was supp and mid on int list gl and proceeded to ban out our supports one trick.","replies":[{"poster":"AeroWaffle","date":"2020-01-28T03:55:35.608+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Allegretto45,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=3Ey8Zghh,comment-id=00080000,timestamp=2020-01-28T03:51:53.345+0000)\n>\n> FOr some context he jumped in champ select and first thing he said was supp and mid on int list gl and proceeded to ban out our supports one trick.\n\nSo you're fine with putting people on \"int lists\" so long as they also do it?
