First game the guy picks Pantheon, okay fine he has a stun and he has defensive capabilities in his passive, maybe it&#039;s just him being offmeta, except he buys Corrupting Potion first item. He proceeds to last hit or try to last hit every single minion in my lane, making me lose 80% of the CS. We win game in end but I was forced to take a back seat because some tool decided he wanted to not play his role and we should have lost badly but enemy was just god awful.\r\n\r\nSecond game, duo in chat asks me if I want to switch roles so they can do some niche double damage lane I tell them no, but the &quot;support&quot; proceeds to play Gangplank anyways, uses his barrels to take farm and I proceed to tell him if he wants to be the carry so damn bad he can have lane to himself (Enemy ADC was d/ced so it didn&#039;t matter if I was in lane or not) and proceeded to roam and gank. Enemy team surrenders because ADC never came back and were suppressed by essentially 2 junglers.\r\n\r\nBoth of these games I sorely wanted to lose just to spite these guys but I would never purposefully throw an entire game just to spite someone. If you get autofilled or if you get support for whatever reason, at least pick someone semi-suited to the role and please don&#039;t proceed to spend the whole time trying to take all the CS.","replies":[{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2018-02-14T06:07:21.512+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"CSing support is not a punishable offense.

While it's true that the CS doesn't \"belong\" to anyone in the lane, all the support will be doing is leaving a gold-starved adc and a gold-starved \"support,\" neither of which will be able to keep up in items with the single enemy adc who is farming solo.  It puts the team at a distinct disadvantage early game, and causes a fair bit of contention and ill-will that ruins the mental game for the adc player.  \n\nIt's one of those situations where communication is so very important.  All the GP had to do was say \"I'm going to play a damage support.  Can we both targon's and share some of the farm so I hit a power spike?\"  Or, if the GP didn't say anything, the adc can say \"GP, you want to run a kill lane bot?   If we both start targon's that will get you a ton of gold early on.\"  If the guy ends up being a jerk, or not wanting to communicate at all... well, you've got the mute/report options as needed.  But at least you know that you tried.  And that you probably won't have to see the guy again.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n_formerly VentressRedeemed_","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ikilleddory","date":"2018-02-15T02:52:58.134+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay so let me understand then, why was that singe support dude with a above average win rate get banned , that like to run smite if its in supports rights to take cs and play off meta its in their rights to pick whatever summoners and champion correct?\n\noh and he also communicated it to his team every match.\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-clap}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"afmghost","date":"2018-02-14T05:24:46.075+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It seems these days that the League meta is a religion more well known than any of the others.\nWhat has our world come to?","replies":[{"poster":"HavokDash","date":"2018-02-15T02:26:36.185+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The \"Meta\" is the FLAVOR OF THE WEEK which changes with every patch.
