The santa penguin ward, which I unlocked with orange essence. I guess this has been a known bug, I was wondering if I can get some reslution to this.

Are you on the updated client?  If so, can you try selecting it on the legacy?\n\n-  On the login screen of the open beta updated client, look for the \"Launch Legacy Client\" text at the bottom.\n-  Or create a shortcut directly to the legacy client in your League Installation. Just look for \"lol.launcher\"\n\nLet me know if that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"Declined","date":"2017-01-04T22:39:45.405+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The Santa Penguin ward is rather old if I recall correctly, so it could be a simple case of him overlooking it since it's it's most likely pretty far down the list of icons.\nJust an observation.","replies":[]}]}]}
