You were suspended because you argued, harassed, insulted, and belittled your team nonstop after ignoring two prior chat restrictions.\n\nWhen you say \"no hate\" are you implying that only hate speech, threats of violence, etc. should have prompted a 14-day suspension? That's incorrect. Those kinds of extreme toxicity can cause you to _skip to_ a 14-day suspension. If you're toxic without hate speech et al., you get chat restrictions for the first two punishments, and _then_ you move up to a 14-day suspension. The punishment system hasn't operated on a structure of endlessly stacking chat restrictions for years. The longer you go on being toxic, the more severe your punishment will get, up to and including a permaban for your next violation (which your reform card is now emphatically warning you about), with the intent of putting a stop to your toxicity... one way or another.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kuthillick","date":"2019-06-13T03:12:26.266+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This overall is a negative log. You complained or harassed teammates all game. One valid report is the same as nine valid reports in a single game. So calling for more reports, especially consistently as you did, is considered harassment by Riot. Saying \"Im reporting XXX\" is ok (not good but ok) but asking others to do so, especially consistently is considered negative and detrimental to both the game and the experience of other players. \n\nToxicity isn't restricted to just hate. It's any form of chat that can negatively impact the experience other players have. You don't have to consistently harass them and doing so does not benefit anyone else. If you NEED to type it out, you can type it then delete it or simply say it out loud. Consistently typing throughout the match also takes away from your own gameplay. Just mute them, report as you feel is necessary post game, and focus on your game.\n\nAlso, a 14 day ban isn't the first step in chat punishment tiers if I remember correctly. Im guessing you either had prior chat bans or other negative games, or both, that led to the 14-day ban.","replies":[{"poster":"ImDexter","date":"2019-06-13T03:21:04.882+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"i did get chat restricts, true and i tried my best not to flame or anything.\n\nbut ur saying just because i said report people i got banned. so them spam pinging me and trash talking isnt, im just gonna ask for a simple favor that will take 20 mins max just go to my account and look at the replay of my last game and look at how toxic trundle and tristana were but i get banned for saying report these children multiple times, nice reasoning u got there, i think that u dont want to admit that ur ban system is at fault and ur just trying to cover up for it by making just unbeleivable reasons that i got banned for.\n\ni think i got banned because either the player who reported me was an employee of riot or its because the banning system made a mistake and i looked at his match history and he did run it down with draven in his past couple of games, but he doesnt get penalized but i do for saying something like please report these children. WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW!!!!!","replies":[{"poster":"Kuthillick","date":"2019-06-13T03:30:21.939+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First: Not my ban system. \n\nSecond: Yes. You probably did get banned for overall negativity and harassment towards teammates resulting in a diminished enjoyment of the playing experience for them. Riot looks at what happened in a vacuum. If you were being trolled by them through pings, mute the pings, mute their chat, and report them at the end of the game. There is no reason to consistently say you are reporting them; it makes the game even less enjoyable for everyone there. You said it once, the players are still the same and probably saw it the first time. Constantly saying it does nothing to help whatsoever. \n\nThird: It was more than just saying to report them as well. You also told them they need to \"grow up\", they \"shouldn't even be allowed to play this game\". You also vocalized a defeatist attitude asking for surrenders and generally giving up. That's understandable mindset to have if you feel like you are being trolled or it's not an enjoyable game. But again, typing it out does nothing beneficial for the game and further sours any experience other players are having, especially Mid and Top lane who aren't mentioned here. \n\nBasically: Don't call for more reports, especially repeatedly. Players most likely know when they are doing poorly. You don't need to point it out to them. And... I hate to sound like a parent but... If you don't have anything nice to say, don't say it. Easy as that. Mute pings, mute chat as necessary and report them yourself at the end of the game. If you feel like their trolling was particularly egregious, submit a Support Ticket to try and have the game manually reviewed.","replies":[{"poster":"ImDexter","date":"2019-06-13T03:47:59.429+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"thanks i guess next time after i mute i wont unmute players because i actually am trying to win the game and just fyi i muted pings they bmed me in chat and then i muted chat and unmuted pings and they kept spam pings so i just kept chat and muted pings and yeaa it resulted to a ban, next time i wont even bother, thanks i guess but i still am not convinced that what i did is even compared to what they did to our team. please just review the game if u want to sound even a little bit reasonable","replies":[{"poster":"Kuthillick","date":"2019-06-13T05:26:58.540+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yep. Most of the time silence and moving on is the best option. \n\nAlso again: it doesn't matter what else was going on. Riot looks at just your behavior because you are the one responsible for it. No one else is forcing you to do anything negative towards your teammates.\n\nIf I helped you see why you got banned and explained it to you I'm glad. I gave examples and reasons for it which I think is the definition of sounding \"a little bit reasonable\" \n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Noodle Wacker","date":"2019-06-13T04:17:35.123+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Overall this is how the system works man, just don't talk in chat and mothing happens.
