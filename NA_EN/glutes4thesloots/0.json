Please try again in a few minutes\". I have been checking regularly for the past 26 hours and still no joy. \r\n\r\nIt would have been no big deal but I only get 3 days a fortnight with which to play League with my friends due to my work, so instead of feeding on Tryndamere for hours on end I've resorted to going outside *shudders* in order to pass the time. \r\n\r\nPlease could somebody enlighten me as to why it is taking so long? I read up on the FAQ and they stated the transfer should be near instantaneous hence my confusion\r\n\r\nThanks in advance","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-02T22:59:32.982+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fixed!  It looks like you were stuck mid-transfer for some reason.  It's a super rare occurrence, but I'm glad you reached out so we can take a look.  Your account has now transferred to NA.  I hope that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"Glutes4ThaSloots","date":"2017-05-03T00:49:56.593+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh my god thank you so much! I noticed it had fixed itself so I've just been on to play a game with my friends before they got off for the day but i thought it had just fixed itself. \n\nThanks again for the help that's awesome :)","replies":[]}]}]}
