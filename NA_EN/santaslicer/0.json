First of all {{summoner:4}} is always being used and a secondary spell is usually {{summoner:14}}. Of course junglers use {{summoner:11}}  and supports use {{summoner:3}}  unless they have enough CC to use {{summoner:14}} . Most top laners take {{summoner:12}}  but of course {{summoner:14}}  is a fallback for top laners. And adcs take {{summoner:7}} and rarely {{summoner:21}}.\r\n\r\nAnd that leaves me wondering how is this balanced if everyone takes {{summoner:4}} and {{summoner:14}}  over anything else unless they have to take something else because of their lane choice.\r\n\r\nSo all in all I just hope that Riot balances out summoner spells so there are other viable summoner spells.","replies":[{"poster":"Captain Gameplay","date":"2014-09-20T01:21:02.631+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"There's a lot to debate here, but I'll try to cover some of my own personal points and opinions on the matter.\n\nFlash is a near mandatory skill because it allows play making and provides all heroes with both an offensive and defensive ability that is frequently game changing. In this regards, it could be considered terrible for the game from a game design perspective. It is singularly so impactful to game play that all heroes must be designed and balanced around it's existence. However, from a player perspective, Flash is actually acceptable, or even desired. To understand why, we can look at Dota, and other Mobas. It is a fairly uncontestable statement that heroes in LoL counter each other to a far lesser degree than heroes in Dota. Why is this? One of the major factors is the existence of Masteries, Runes, and Summoner Spells. Each of these serve to allow individual heroes to adapt against other heroes. In this case, Flash is ESPECIALLY effective - can you imagine how heroes without an escape could possible escape a J4 Ultimate? They cannot. Thus without Flash, if one team saw their opponents pick non-mobility heavy composition, then picking counters such as J4 who can easily and continuously abuse that deficiency would make for a much more one sided game then if Flash were an option. This of course leads to the question of: Doesn't Flash therefore reduce the strategy involved in pick/ban phase of the game? In short, yes, yes it does. Having played other Mobas for 4+ years now, I can tell you that team compositions and lane matchups matter far and above more at non-competitive level game play in other Mobas like Dota versus in LoL. \n\ntl;dr - Flash is mandatory because how uniquely powerful for its offensive and defensive uses, allowing it to single handedly change how games are played and won. While un-elegant, this isn't necessarily bad because it allows more freedom in team composition, though at the cost of some strategic depth and hero diversity.\n\nIgnite can be seen as the counter to Flash. How many times do you notice that you flash even though you will die to ignite? Instead of trying to chase enemies for that last bit of damage, (after they escaped using flash, or some other permissible mobility skill due to the existence of Flash), you can simply Ignite the opponent. On top of its extra burst damage and occasionally useful healing reduction, I think it is this factor that makes Ignite the almost de-facto second summoner.\n\nAll other summoners except revive seem to have their own situational uses that make them acceptable, and I don't think there is any complaints there.","replies":[{"poster":"Duchess of Deer","date":"2014-09-20T06:54:07.159+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"i can see that you play dota  too","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Eagleheart","date":"2014-09-19T23:59:38.630+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"The only time I see {{summoner:10}}  is with {{summoner:12}}  for the dreaded Zombie {{champion:30}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"12tales","date":"2014-09-20T03:48:57.586+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"I personally like the gameplay that flash offers.

Right now the problem is that most usecase are just not cleare enough. It's ften just hard to predict if it's worth to use that high-cd to get out of cc, or if it wouldn't make much difference.\nI think especially a lower cd(maybe cc geting lowered when ever u get cced?) would be best as u could use it more freely with out the fear of wasteing a very high cd.\n- {{summoner:13}}:\nClearity either needs lower cd or way more mana reffiled(like full mana), so choosing this summoner allows u to skip mana-sustain from items to actually make it worth a summoner slot\n- {{summoner:2}} : Clearvoyance also could use a lower cd, or a bigger aoe with longer duration. It's just not granted that u really gain much from useing it, so u should either be allowed to use it more freely, or it should have more impact to make it a more reliable scouting tool.\n\n-  {{summoner:6}}:If u use Ghost, u rarly can be sure to get away or catch up for the kill befor ur enemy gets help, just like cleanse. So either againlower cds so u can use it more freely if u feel like u need it, or a 100%speedbuff that decays down to normal ghost level over 2-3 sek, so u can actually use it reaktivly and respond to situations. A reduction of low-effeckts would also realy help Ghost, as it currently gets countered by slows really hard(just like any other speedbuff, which is a huge reason for mobillity-creep, as speedbased mobillity is way to easily countered so u need gapcloser to get anywhere).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Duke Anax","date":"2014-09-20T07:54:18.553+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"{{summoner:4}} is only so overused because players are too stubborn not to take it. \n\nThere are a lot of champs who have a dash that is equal to or stronger than Flash and has less than a tenth of the cooldown.\nThose champions should take two other summoners spells, because they are worth more than one extra dash, or even the option for a doubble dash.\n\n{{summoner:2}} is way underrated.
