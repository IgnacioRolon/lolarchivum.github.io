Was curious, as it was one of the rare cases here where we get logs presented willingly and can't seem to help the poster find a solid reason for the immediate escalation.\n\nWould love to clear that one up, both for his sake and for mine -- it's been puzzling me. :P","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Angrychickén","date":"2017-05-22T22:01:49.933+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"chat logs?\n\nOtherwise we can't help.","replies":[]},{"poster":"èGirl Nami","date":"2017-05-22T07:17:22.118+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Chat logs","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2017-05-22T02:36:26.743+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you didn't get an e-mail from Riot and your client isn't telling you, [send in a ticket to Riot Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).
