We just wrapped up the regular season of Riot Rumble here, which got me thinking about how playing League with my coworkers has improved my play. For those of you that don’t know, Riot Rumble is a company-wide tournament where we can take a break from work, get to know each other, and have some fun playing League (victory tastes  so much sweeter when it's over your co-workers).\r\n\r\nNow, I wasn’t the most hardcore League player before I joined Riot. I basically played Ashe from tutorials through level 30; I didn’t branch out and try new champs because I was afraid to fail in front of my (much more experienced) fellow Rioters. So I was terrified when I was asked by some coworkers to join their Rumble team as their Marksman. \r\n\r\nI’d have to learn new champs and quickly level up my play in order to compete. Fortunately, I wasn’t on my own. I had four teammates in my corner encouraging me - giving me tips, sending me tutorials, and supporting me in practice games. After playing with these guys for the past few months I’ve grown dramatically as a player, learned three new champs (Caitlyn, Jinx, and Graves), and even carried my team in a few games. Most importantly, I’ve had a ton of fun getting to know my coworkers on a personal level -- so much so that we are planning on entering ranked together. \r\n\r\nSo how about you? I'd love to hear your stories about the friends you play with, whether you're the one leading the pack or whether you rely on them to help you level up.","replies":[{"poster":"Catloaf","date":"2015-03-18T18:32:39.853+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"I play alone soloQ best queue {{item:3070}} {{champion:32}} {{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"HeadHonchkrow","date":"2015-03-30T12:26:00.468+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel u bro\nAlways, noobs","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CaptainTatertits","date":"2015-03-18T21:30:48.619+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"My team consists solely of Me, Myself, and I, and they all suck.  :/","replies":[]},{"poster":"MrCrumb","date":"2015-03-18T21:19:04.546+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can confirm.

This team may be no more at the moment but...It was great team of silly dorky friends. We didn't care much about what roles we played. Sometimes...\n\nI met 1 from another friend who she met on another game. He is still my friend till this day even if they aren't friends anymore. He prefers Top or Jungle. Sometimes Support. Hates arams. Get easily mad or frustrated. I have patience.\n\nThe other one who would mostly play mid or occasionally top is my first online friend ever. I met him in a AI game where he called mid after I did but hey its a bot game so we both went mid. He threw me a whole bunch silly faces/emoticons in the chat and in the end of that game we became instant friends. I would talk to him a lot in Skype. LOVES to play the piano in it too. He likes all game modes. Have not seen him much this year due to school.\n\nThe 3rd dude I met also in another AI game in late 2013. He prefers Mid or Jungle or Teemo any lane. I was trying out Riven for the first time when I noticed a Heimerdinger camping at the enemy base. He got several pentas. I know its stupid but I was still new to the game and I was in a little depressing mood. I cheered on him! I thought it was the funniest thing ever. After that game I added him. Didn't play with him much for the first 2 months that I added him. Herd his voice for the first time in Skype (He was munching on food) and from then on I dragged him to play with me. We still occasionally play (His time is different from mine so its kinda hard). He doesn't care what mode we play.\n\nThen I met a Lee Sin in an Aram game where I was playing Karma. I was being super silly and /ALL chat \"Please be gentle with Lee Sin! He's my blind boyfriend!\" (I thought Karma & Lee Sin were dating). That Lee Sin went with it and throughout the game he also became my friend on Skype too. He doesn't really like playing with anyone for Summoner's Rift. But he is my go to Aram buddy! (Thought I'd add him here cause he's awesome like that)\n\nThe last person was a girl (The 1st girl I met that wasn't mean like the ones I've met. Miracles do happen! I had bad luck.) \nShe was the sweetest thing ever. I met her in a normal Summoner's Rift. I was her Support and she was playing Tristana. We were also playing with the 1st guy I mentioned and the 2nd one. \nAnyway, I think she was doing good but one of my friends started being toxic to her. I was so mad and in the end we won. I added that Tristana player. I just kinda randomly dragged her to play with me. Then I added her Skype and we are still chatting up a storm till this day. She can do all lanes! And yeah that toxic friend ended up apologizing to her.\n\nWe are mostly casual players. I am happy with them. They are my first group of online friends and I cherish them. Right now I mostly play with 3 of them. The others are busy with their schedules now but I would sometimes run into them and we would play a game or two. \n\nI thank LoL for these great friends. (I plan to visit a few of em someday) I'M SORRY FOR THE BLOCK OF TEXT!!!","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Neon","date":"2015-03-19T16:59:11.872+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow,  this is so cool. It's funny how League gives you the opportunity to collect a random group of friends across the country. I've collected a few myself. One guy beat the crap out of me mid lane and we got to chatting after the game and he became one of my favorite people to play with. Another guy I met  because we laned together and he was super positive. Another was a friend of a friend who just ended up playing with us a bunch somehow. It was cool to get everyone on Skype and play a game, with the only thing we had in common being our love of League :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"AJStarhiker","date":"2015-03-18T18:51:37.058+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Back when I first started, all my League friends were the RL friends who got me hooked.

They were looking for a jungler around silver/gold who played some support-y champions, with particular encouragement for players who followed the competitive scene. As a long-time jungler and diehard TSM fan, I figured I fit the bill pretty well.\n\nIt was a step outside my usual bots/aram shell, but the guys are funny as heck, and I can sling a joke, so we meshed well, and I really enjoy playing with them. It's nice having a group that sets up your games for you, you know? Plus, I know what they can play, so I only have to adapt to the enemy on the fly.\n\n I have a pretty good grasp on many jungle champs, but I've picked up vi, reksai, nid and sej since joining (gotta stay meta), and have relearned fizz, zac, and rengar to suit our comps' needs. My warding and gank pathing have improved tremendously with my support's guidance, and I get to flaunt my #sweetplaymakingskills (rammus taunt over dragon wall being my favorite to date) to people who care.\n\nStill gotta work on smiting though...I blame my ping and my laptop for that.","replies":[{"poster":"Randomnewguy","date":"2015-03-18T20:36:29.473+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's awesome that you guys met on boards.

Last portion of previous sentence per phone call. Also, the Gaming Lounge stated they had to cancel the Tournament, which I hope was not to free up a slot, or make one less team to compete against. Some teams with almost as much can be jus a threatening with wins in League of Legends.

Maybe another board or forum.\n\nThe FuryofThornsRedo has welcomed some new Champions gifted not one, as to support the sometimes qualification in tournament play as in needing to be Champion dexterous ready with 16 Champions ability to Promote wins inside of games.

When I began working in another building last year, I also got some of my coworkers interested in League. We were a team of 4 and were looking for a 5th for what seemed like forever. I played with some random teams I met on the boards to see if I could get any ranked teams rewards. I never clicked with any of them except one. He always played support and I normally adc'd and we were a great duo. Eventually that team we were on broke up and I had him sitting in my friends list and realized that he was our 5th! When I heard his voice for the first time over Curse, I thought he was around my age. But nope, he's 14 and lives in Canada! Most mature 14 year old I've ever met haha. And one of the greatest supports too. \n\nOur team enjoys each other so much,  we even began playing other games together too (clash of clans, don't starve together, etc)\nThank you League for bringing us together.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RP Tzuyu","date":"2015-03-20T00:06:58.562+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"rage quit top, toxic mid, feeding bots, unskilled jg anything else?","replies":[]},{"poster":"eflier","date":"2015-03-24T16:08:27.582+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey guys could yall checkout my post about getting a duo queue partner.
