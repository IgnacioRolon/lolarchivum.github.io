My character will literally just stand there like an idiot while i get poked by my laner for free. its the most frustrating thing ive ever seen. I thought it would be fixed after the first game but it happened again. Then i restarted my router and played again and it still happened. Now ive played like 5 games in total and theyve all had this stupid delay lag. I also went into command prompt and pinged 8.8.8.8 and i got no packet loss, so yea idk what the problem is","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-11-10T23:04:48.962+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Let's help pinpoint if this is an issue like packet loss or maybe a configuration corruption.
