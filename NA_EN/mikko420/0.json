Couldn't find a fix anywhere, so I thought maybe the LoL community could give me answers.  My custom items set page stopp\bed working.  I can't drag items into the appropriate slots.  When I click and hold, it follow the mouse, but I can't actually drop it in the item set.  It just yo-yos back to its original position as soon as I release the mouse button.  I reinstalled the whole game yesterday, and it doesn't seem to have helped, since I am still raging against my computer.  If anybody has found a fix, even a temporary one, I'd like to know about it...  Thanks a lot!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-02-01T18:32:33.281+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That sounds like a strange issue and I'd like to help!  Are you on a Mac or PC?  What happens if you swap your mouse?  Are you using any third party programs that interact with league?  Let me know!","replies":[{"poster":"Mikko420","date":"2017-02-02T16:30:38.792+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the assist.  I play on a mac. I tried using my track pad, and my external mouse, and it does the same thing.  I don't believe any third party program can interact with it.  I even take the time to close all running programs before I actually play the game.  I found a kind of fix on the internet, where they recommended that I try moving icons on my desktop, and press esc to clear the problem, but that doesn't seem to be working for me, and I really don't see how it could've been any help to anyone, considering there is no real change done.  I,ve tried everything I could think of, and when I opened my league today, found the same problem was still keeping me from updating my item sets...  I really hope you can help, but if you can't, thanks anyways for taking interest.","replies":[{"poster":"Mikko420","date":"2017-02-02T16:31:07.418+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh, and I have also tried the hextech repair tool without success...","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-02-02T16:41:05.958+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for getting back to me.  There's actually an issue right now with the Sierra OS that's preventing Item lists from being used.  We outlined it in our current [pinned thread](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/bJx6P0hX-known-bugs-in-macos-1012-sierra), that recommends editing item lets through another PC/Operating system as a workaround.  I don't have any eta or information to provide beyond that, but I hope the workaround can help!","replies":[{"poster":"Mikko420","date":"2017-02-02T17:19:52.841+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok.  Well thanks for the workaround.  I really hope there's a fix soon though, cause this is majorly inconvenient for me...","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
