In the months following release, however, our balance work on Rek&rsquo;Sai de-emphasized her damage threat in favor of her team utility strengths. Her optimal playstyle settled into the Vanguard (offensive tank) space, and that identity mismatch has caused a lot of player frustration. So, when Rek&rsquo;Sai&rsquo;s competitive dominance put her on the balance radar, we resolved not to make the same mistake twice.\n\n>Overall, fixing Rek&rsquo;Sai&rsquo;s role requires more than being cognizant of where to cut power, and we won&rsquo;t promise that this&rsquo;ll be the last time Rek&rsquo;Sai visits the patch notes. That said, pushing her back toward kill-or-be-killed skirmishes is the first step in the process\n\nDoes it mean that Riot want to bring back old Warrior (instead of Cinderhulk) Rek&#039;Sai and nerf her Full Tank build?","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2016-09-08T00:40:55.801+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"We're planning on doing some work on Rek'Sai to shift her back towards a more damage focused champ.

I am perfectly fine with the damage nerfs she has received, but I have hated the overall changes to other parts of her kit. She doesn't feel Rek'sai at all after her Tremor Sense changes, because she isn't able to locate her prey exactly.

She's designed to sustain off her rage, and empowers her E with it. But that's completely overshadowed when you build her tank. \n\nReduce her defenses, but increase her sustain. Should allow her to clear well without becoming too hard to kill. And perhaps give her rage mechanic stronger scaling with offensive itemization.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DeadUnborn","date":"2016-09-08T02:10:20.615+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"****\n                       ACTUAL CHANGES listed bellow, in case my rant is too tideous to read {{champion:421}} {{item:3070}} \n\n****\n\nSo I was planning to make an entire post about it myself but since you have commented here at that increases the chances of Riot seeing my cries of anguish I'll post it here. I am a one trick rek sai on LAN (same summoner name) and having played a ton of games with her (with a win rate that picked at 70% and a performance 40% above average) and climbed all the way to plat 2, until you guy's decided to nerf her her radar and messed my mojo, I think I could present some valuable insight on what she is supposed to become going forward. \n\nFirst of, I totally get that you gutted her early game so that worlds would have some diversity. By reading the patch notes I get the sense that you are trying to communicate : \"yeah we are aweare we totally messed her up but in the commming futures after worlds balance is no longer at risk we will define her identity as a fighter and move her away from tanky builds\". At first I was really worried that rek sai would recieve the poppy treatment and not be buffed until eaons later as an after thought, but this makes me hopeful that you guys are invested in balancing and defining her role as a bruiser.\n\nSo with that out of the way, I'd like to start by giving my 2 cents on what Rek Sai's core strenghts and weaknesses are. She is a melee bruiser that excels and farming, counter jungling (through tracking and mobility)  and getting ahead in gold so that she is stronght mid game and can fight, splitpush and do other fun shennanigans.\n\nTo do this, she should rely on being more damage oriented than she currently is (having to buy 2 or even 3 damage items would be ideal), should not have so much early pressure ganking wise, and should need to get gold through clever jungling to stay ahead and THEN become a threat to other players. In short, she should not be as tanky and shoulld rely in items to stay relevant.\n\nNow this are just some adjustments I would recommend in order to accomplish the vision of what I understand rek sai to be, and of course without actual play test I don't now if they are great or not, but after player her as much as I do I think I have a good sense of what should be done.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n****\nCHANGES (just brain storming, not saying all the changes have to be implemented in orther to fix rek sai\n\n\nPassive:\nThis is the most effy of all my proposed changes, since it would probably require art resources to be aloccated to the change and I'm not sure how flexible your teams are since I believe now they are standardized by teams. However I don't think the resources  used would be that hefty and it might be possible to use them.\n\nMake rek sais delay between sonar \"ticks\" be longer as the target moves away from rek sai, having a fix tick rate of .75 secs up until 200 untils and then start delaying it until about 1.25 secs. This behaviour would be comunicated in game by having an expansive soundwave (same color as texture as the sonar circles) that would move at the necesary speed to indicate when rek sai \"sees things\"; the sound wave deaccelerates over time. Also the sound wave would be visible to allies, and enemies when they have vision of rek sai. Also not sure how to make the wave not clutter the map... wmaybe it could work better if only rek sai saw the sound wave but enemies could see the circles they are making when rek sai is visible\n\nQ:\n\nMake it have have less  base damage, do increased damage to jungle monsters and scale slightly better. This makes rek sai great at farming, insentivises damage builds at caps her early ganking/ dueling pressure\n\nW:\n\nNot sure how good this would be for clarity purposes but maybe have knock up hight on enemy chanmpions increase by rank level? The idea here is to make rek sai's early ganks less viable, although the Q change might suffice for that. I'm not super confident about this change but have nothing to lose by posting it, it might work\n\nE: (Important one!)\n\nMake rek sai's tunnels go from 22 to 18 seconds, but drastically reduce the amount of time a tunnel is up (10 minutes is super forgiving!). Without play testing I can't say for certain how long they should last (thinking for about 2 mins maybe?). The idea is that if rek sai is counter jungled and her tunnels destroyed or she doessn't use her tunnels efficiently for farming early game then after, say 2 mins later, they will start collapsing and reduce her farming speed quite drastically.\n\nAlso her bite doing true damage is one of the reasons tank rek sai works. If rek sai builds tank, then she can always wait for her rage meter to fill up and then do insane damage. Instead, her bite should have bonus flat armor pen when her rage bar fills up. Also possibly for this to work the base damage of the skill should be lowered and the scaling increased.\n\nR: \n\nto me this ability is ok at present, the cd was too forgiving before but now it is acceptable\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSome other stat changes to accomany these would be necessary of course, but my main concern is her having so little armor early game, which will impact her first clear in a really bad way","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ForgiveColour","date":"2016-09-07T18:49:10.493+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Friendly reminder that Reksai is pretty much p/b status ever since she got introduced to the lcs which is almost 2 years ago","replies":[{"poster":"Quinterro","date":"2016-09-07T21:24:20.552+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But i think if Riot nerfed Tank Rek Sai and buff fighter Rek'Sai + nerf her utility (e.g. revert change to her W that if u max it she can knock up enemies a bit faster after knocking them up earlier) it should be healthy for game (because if she built offensive items, she wouldn't be so tanky) and especially for LCS, where warrior on Rek'Sai isn't as viable as Cinderhulk.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"XIII Vanitas","date":"2016-09-08T01:15:23.797+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly, Warrior is still garbage compared to the other enchantments.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sexy Jack Rabbit","date":"2016-09-08T05:00:30.480+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why no talk on Kalista?
