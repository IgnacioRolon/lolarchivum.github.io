It's basically ripped directly off of Heroes of the Storm.\n\nWhen I first got to ranked in that game and saw that solo-queue was for 1-4 man queues, I was like, \"Wait, what?\" Yeah, in that one at least if you had a full 5 you were made to go into team queue.  Anyhow, you think, \"Wow, that's great! I'm not much for having to deal with randoms, and this way I don't have to choose between a bunch of my friends!\"\n\nWell, issue number 1 immediately is that as you get into higher MMR's, you see way more teams.  This means to have a great chance at doing much, you need to have the same organization - IE, gotta have a team as well.  So if you're never climbing, you're probably having a jolly time and are free to go about playing when and where you want.\n\nThis gets to not be the case in higher MMR's. It may not even be more teams but more that a higher percentage of players are playing in teams - this basically restricts what times you can go into solo-queue if you don't have people to play with.  This also means if you're not on at good hours of the day, then you're probably not going to have a consistent team, either.  If you don't have a consistent team, you can't climb higher. You will basically be stunted solely by the fact that you do not have the same access to resources other players do - don't have a diamond 1 friend on at the same time as you? Well, sucks to be you.\n\nIt's something that sounds great on paper but in practice is just lousy and even more restricting than ever.  You're stuck to either fall or not climb, or you're given strict time-frames when you and your mates can all be on to queue up.
