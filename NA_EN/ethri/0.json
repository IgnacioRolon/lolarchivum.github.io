After playing Lulu for 4 years, this is the first time I noticed such a prioritization.  I've lost quite a few fights due to me shielding a minion/ enemy when I Alt+e.\n\nIs there any way to change this?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-14T18:33:34.040+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Abilities will always cast on an ally if you have them selected, regardless of using a self-cast keystroke.

After some thorough testing, I found the behavior you're experiencing only happened when I changed to 'Quick self-cast'. If this is the type of casting you're using, I recommend switching over to regular self-cast where this may not happen.\n\nLet me know.","replies":[{"poster":"Ethri","date":"2016-08-22T19:21:16.268+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you so much for taking the time to look into it!!
