These include **bold**, *italics*, ~~strikethrough~~ and adding [links](http://community.na.leagueoflegends.com/)!\r\n* Renamed the \"Beta Feedback\" sub-community to \"New Community Feedback\" to hopefully guide Summoners looking for the [PBE Forum](http://community.pbe.leagueoflegends.com) in the right direction.\r\n* Fixed messaging for low-level Summoners trying to vote on Discussions or Comments.\r\n\r\nPlease let us know what you think of the new changes!","replies":[{"poster":"Krylhos","date":"2013-11-12T23:34:58.519+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"I love it!","replies":[]},{"poster":"SlumlordThanatos","date":"2013-11-13T07:01:46.348+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Better.\n\nNot what absolutely needs to be done, but better.\n\nStill waiting for the flat layout support.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sir Frosthaven","date":"2013-11-13T22:34:32.205+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I love the toolbar and it functions as expected, but the button images seem a bit out of place?
