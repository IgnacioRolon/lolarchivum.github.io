Janna pretty much punishes teams very hard if they cannot pull off a perfect engage or just fall behind on the rotational play...and she also fits in well with the still popular \"protect the hypercarry\"-comps.","replies":[{"poster":"NeroUS","date":"2014-09-28T06:04:46.951+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Janna and Thresh both offer a lot to teams with a high level of coordination.

I would also note that both Janna and Nami are power picks in that they work well with many team comps. The best example is with how powerful Yasuo is,  both of these supports have the potential to set up his ultimate. so they're taken both to go with Yasuo or to prevent the enemy having them for with Yasuo. It's not just Yasuo though,  their abilities to engage and disengage are very useful against top talent. With the importance of objectives such as dragons,  there's more fighting in the jungle (which is more confined than lanes) thereby making it easier to land their cc abilities. Also with the vision war in enemy jungle territory,  both of these champions are good at safely establishing vision since they can self peel if they run in to a team.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"lorewise","date":"2014-09-27T05:08:16.661+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"They counter the popular all in comps with their ability to reset fights.\n\nThey both provide knock ups and these synergize well with a few champions but Yasuo most of all, and he's quite popular this season.\n\nThey both provide speed boosts to their allies, and this season has seen more rotations. There's a trend away from heavy farm, or to counter hyper carries, or to give their own hyper carries an easier time in lane.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tsunday","date":"2014-09-27T02:58:03.344+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Janna has been a top tier pick all season. There have been plenty of support mains swearing by her. Why? Because she's Thresh/Leona's biggest counters. Later people found Morgana, whose spell shield and snare worked wonders against a hard engage support, and when Braum came out he too did well against Thresh/Leona in terms of saving his carry. Janna was there first though. Not only was Janna there first, but unlike Morgana she doesn't require any big ticket items. Morg really wants her Zhonyas for her ult. In higher level play if she tries to ult a team and doesn't have Zhonyas, she's pretty much dead (not that this isn't true in lower elo). Janna doesn't need a Zhonyas or any other expensive item to set up her CC.\n\nNami was actually a support that was preemptively nerfed. She doesn't really 'counter' the tanky meta supports of Season 4, but she had good enough disengage/cc that nobody ever complained when you took Nami against someone like Thresh or Leona. Nami has good disengage like Janna, she has good sustain with her heals, she has good engage.\n\nBasically the tanky supports that ran everyone else out of botlane in the beginning of the year are finding counters with heavy disengage oriented CC supports. These supports have good buffs for their allies (who doesn't like 50 bonus AD?), good sustain (whereas thresh/leo have none), and they fit well with almost any ADC.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Red Warden","date":"2014-09-26T19:57:56.434+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since adc's are mostly all about scaling, supports that give heavy peel and sustain work a lot better than, engage/ tank supports who function best  with early game adc's ( most of whom are weaker at all stages of the game to the scaling adc's like Trist and Kog because of the itemization changes)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sunfield","date":"2014-09-26T18:49:44.955+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wasnt she like top eastern pick that the rest of the regions had to adapt to?","replies":[]},{"poster":"DCZephyros","date":"2014-09-30T12:54:18.296+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm sure it's due to being able to protect the hyper carries, letting them stay alive and do their thing. They offer protection in the form or shields, heals, peel and disengage. They also prevent/stall assassins from doing their job.

Janna is huge disengage. She trades off some of the heavy laning phase power other supports have for late-game saves. In Worlds, most of the time they don't have a legit laning phase. 2v1 top switch, running as a team and killing turrets, not engaging the enemy duo until post-six at least... Given this typical set-up, this allowed Janna's weaknesses to be overlooked. There was one Caitlyn/Nami game that she got destroyed, and some other recent tournament match (can't recall) where the enemy baited Janna's ult and killed her team multiple times. Unfortunately, haven't seen that much, so Janna shines like a gem right now until people smarten up :P\n\nEdit: Nami is good all around and goes with most adcs easily. She's better poke/sustain than Sona because she has heavy CC instead of a slow, which better sets up kills or aids with escapes. And that auto-enhancement and slow? Super yummy. And like Janna, she's got a huge disrupt for her ult (though they're used quite differently, yes).","replies":[]}]}
