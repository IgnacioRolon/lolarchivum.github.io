Another point is that they weren&rsquo;t in contact through letters because if they were Darius would know of the coup Swain was planning but he didn&rsquo;t.\r\nDraven is left drowning his sorrows in a bar so much that he threw up. Obviously he is not dealing with the war well. Where was Darius in all of this? No where to be seen. Then Draven without the help of Darius joins with Swain. Long story short they overthrow Darkwill and what happens? Darius becomes one of the three positions of power instead of Draven. Draven basically gets nothing for the nightmare fuel he had to go through. Do people actually think this is a sign of a good healthy brother relationship?","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2018-09-05T05:37:41.395+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's quite the spin you've put on that.\n\n{{sticker:draven-pose}} {{sticker:darius-angry}} \n\nYou mention the Ionian Wars, but ignore RyzeTheSmurfMage's point about Darius being on the front lines of at least part of the war with Quilletta (seeing the aftermath of the gas attack).\n\nThen you suggest that Draven is going through hell, drowning his sorrows in a bar and throwing up - you think those are the actions of a leader of Noxus?

He probably does, so why would he send Darius on such a dangerous mission if he knows that he could get killed by her soldiers or been taken to her citadel or even freeze to death?\nDoes he not care about Darius? Did he purposefully try to get Darius killed by sending him to the freljord?","replies":[{"poster":"mrmeddyman","date":"2018-09-05T10:46:34.062+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"No, Swain wasn't Grand General at the time Darkwill was.
