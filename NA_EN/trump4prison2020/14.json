Ironically, the burger comes with cheese which doesn&#039;t make sense if you&#039;re eating a burger without animal products.\r\n\r\nSo I go in, I order 3 and ask for **NO cheese**. I said it twice, the cashier told the dude at the grill &quot;no cheese, you hear?&quot; Guess what I got? Three sliders **WITH cheese**. \r\n\r\nOnly reason I didn&#039;t take it back was because it looked like their manager was rushing them to do something by 11, so I didn&#039;t want to give them more work. Still, you&#039;ll never catch me  in there again\r\n\r\n{{sticker:sg-ahri-3}}","replies":[]}
