Nerf Zoe!!\"","subforum":"General Discussion","up_votes":2,"down_votes":9,"body":"Me (an intelligent individual): Actually, Zoe deals essentially 0 damage if you dodge her Q. All you have to do is step to the right or left. And yes, you can do this for ALL the Qs she throws at you; if you&#039;ve seen someone perfect rhythm games on the highest difficulty (like moi), you&#039;d know this is possible. You just have to be cool, calm and collected.\r\n\r\nRiot: *caves to community complaints to protect skin sales and nerfs Zoe*\r\n\r\nMe: sigh... *dons fedora and walks off to find a CHALLENGING game to play, never to return*","replies":[]}
