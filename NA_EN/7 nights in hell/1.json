I got it first after 10 game chat restriction 5 months ago and a month after I got another one without reaching back tier 1 now it has been 4 months without restrictions or bans, i have been honored regulary and haven't flamed. My question is how long it takes to get back tier 1 and tier 2 im kinda frustrated i wanna play competitive but i can't see the progress, how far im with my climb back to honor 1. I play an average of 2 or 3 games a day on weekends 8.
