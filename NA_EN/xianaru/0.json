League is eating up anywhere between 1-2 Mbps (viewed in task manager) to the extend that I can't even view( status's put up by friends in the client.\n\nThis has started occuring since the new tab has appeared on the left hand side. Making a support ticket about this as well.\n\nStrange that it's causing the client itself to lag. Following are it's repurcussions\n\n1.)  Unknown error occured appears very often. \n\n2.) I can't click accept when I start a game the client lags out.\n\n3.) Very frequently get the \"Retrieving data from server\" message\n\n4.) Currently trying to start an Aram, have clicked accept. I'm stuck at the \"waiting for other players\" for past 15s. \n\nNot sure why this is happening. Are there any files you would like me to provide?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-22T18:05:52.133+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nothing has really changed that would require more bandwidth, but keep in mind that matches requires a strong, consistent connection to play.
