She'd know about Ekko's abilities before she ever engaged, and she has the cunning to lay a trap, the accuracy to end the fight in a single shot, and the tools to defeat Ekko's passive defenses (which are essentially none). One shot to the liver and it's over. Ekko can't create multiple timelines around this fight if he doesn't get to go back a single time.\n\nTo approach your final comment from another perspective: I can attempt to lift 2,000 pounds a number of times in a number of different ways, but it will fail every time. Ekko doesn't possess the mind to defeat Camille in a one-on-one battle, because Camille doesn't fight. She hunts. If by some miracle he manages to survive the first encounter... Short of seeking tactical education, he'll never truly overcome her. At best, he'll drive her off to be hunted by her a different way the next time.\n\nAnd even that's giving him way too much credit in the face of this obstacle. Ekko's abilities are impressive, but he has to be able to use them or he literally has nothing to bring to the fight.","replies":[{"poster":"Warlord Dienekes","date":"2018-04-27T00:06:50.696+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"She does not know about the fight now. \n\nWhat are the rules here.

A peasant can kill Garen if he stabs him while he’s asleep.\n\nAlbert Einstein was a super genius. Put him in command of an army, and that army is doomed. Give him a weapon and pit him against a cunning warrior, and he won't last three seconds. Ekko's genius is scientific, not tactical. Scientific genius only helps a tiny bit when you're talking about combat intelligence.\n\nRemember, the OP asked _lorewise_, who wins? Lorewise, Camille is the hunter and those she fights are the hunted. Lorewise, Ekko is generally the scrappy underdog, not the prepared warrior who keeps his head on a swivel. Lorewise, why would they be fighting to begin with? Most likely, Ekko got on the wrong entrepreneur's bad side, and Camille goes in to deal with him. In such a case, Camille knows she's going to kill the time wizard and Ekko doesn't get to know he's hunted, unless he's suddenly developed an acute foresight for danger that's coming days ahead.\n\nBut let's assume it's a stand-up fight. Let's assume they're on equal footing. Camille is a superior fighter. Better training, better equipment, better preparation as a general practice, better instincts, better tactical assessment, peerless precision. In the lore, Ekko takes a lot of hits. Most everyone here who gives him the fight says it only happens after taking several effective losses, then rewinding time to get an unfair edge going into the next round.\n\nI argue that Camille is so superior as a fighter that her first hit is going to end it, even if he sees it coming. If not the first, the second or third. Remember, **Ekko takes a lot of hits**, this is lore-established. If a trained mixed martial artist can hit another trained mixed martial artist with a precision knockout punch in the real world, surely a fictional assassin with insane training, hexabionic augments and a perfect eye for reach and points of impact can land a precision strike on a science whiz with a hextech time-crystal.\n\nIf that perfect strike lands to the eye, the liver, the heart, or several other places, Ekko's body overloads with adrenaline and shuts down, and he bleeds unconscious by the time it wears off. This is combat science. Seeing as Ekko has nothing in the way of armor to protect against those blows, I don't see how he wins this fight, even face-to-face.","replies":[{"poster":"Warlord Dienekes","date":"2018-04-27T03:01:08.201+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Curiosity, before we go further.  You ever been in a knife fight?  Or even researched stab wounds at all?\n\nCuz I've done both.  And you cannot just say \"oh a stab here and the guy goes down.\"  That's not how the human body works.  You'll get people who get knocked unconscious after one punch in the gut, and you'll get people still alive and trucking with a hole in their brain.  People have fought back with their esophagus torn off.  Pressure points to consistently shut down a body are pretty much a myth.  They may work, they may completely fail.  Basically on luck.  What you can do is joint locks which can get your opponent into a position where they can't move, most of the effective ones I know work best with the use of your legs.  Or, you can cut off oxygen to your opponent's brain.  This takes somewhere between 30 seconds to 2 minutes depending on the person.  Again, the human body is variable as hell.\n\nHonestly, adrenaline can take you far.  I didn't even realize I was stabbed until about 15 minutes after my fight ended.\n\nAs to your assessment.  Superior training?  Sure.  Superior instincts? Probably.  Superior equipment?  Hell no.  Ekko uses time grenades, a time machine, and again has multiple timeline and cross-dimensional bodies to try this with.  Camille lost her legs and decided to replace them with a weapon that is worse than just using a sword in every conceivable way.  I cannot harp on enough about how stupid her design is from a fighting standpoint.","replies":[{"poster":"The LCS Is Dumb","date":"2018-04-27T04:26:17.883+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The main issue I have with this argument is this - there are parts of the body that, when cut, the blood loss will be so rapid that you basically only have minutes to live.

Assuming she can use her legs almost as well as most people use their arms, which I'll give her because it's fantasy, there are advantages.

Out of line of sight is iffy but i’ll give you. Longer reach? No. \n\nLet’s say Camille is 6’, honestly I think she’s a bit shorter but that’s an easy base line. Going by her body proportions that makes her legs about 4’ because she has messed up proportions. But still that gives us a base number. Her arms reach is about 3’. Now a Renaissance rapier has a blade length of 3’4” on average. Some go as long a story 4’. That is a 6’ reach vs a 4’ reach. \n\nIn addition the angle of attack is smaller since all the vital areas on a persons body is at the top. \n\nAnd she could actually use 2 feet to balance. Now she is literally balancing on a single knife point whenever she attacks. That is terrible design.  You need to be able to move or redirect yourself and strike simultaneously. \n\nAnd finally, she can’t defend herself from upper attacks.

Not as much freedom as she'd have with a regular old sword, mind, but it's there.\n\nRegarding the liver shot, the reason boxers sometimes keep going is the gloves. When a boxer goes down from a liver shot, it's because of pure force. When a savate kick, for example, brings you down with a liver shot... That's because you get the toes underneath the ribs and dig directly into the liver. That's far more reliable, albeit tougher to land with the pinpoint accuracy required to actually cause an adrenaline dump. But that's why I give Camille this fight; her precision is second to none. Plus, she's not simply throwing a kick. She's puncturing straight through.\n\nIt doesn't matter how tough your body is if the liver is pierced right through. For example, if you're wearing a thick gambeson and someone catches you with the edge of a knife once, you're probably not going to feel it. If the gambeson is punctured with a rapier, however, that's going to do significant damage to what's underneath. A tough exterior means nothing if the attack gets inside it.\n\nTo be clear, I'm not saying the liver shot would end the fight. I'm not suggesting Camille would stab him through the liver and then walk away the victor. Merely that the resulting adrenaline dump would shut his nervous system off for 2-4 seconds, which is plenty of time for someone like Camille to finish the job any number of ways. Ekko needs to actively _activate_ his time reversal power, which he can't do if his body isn't responding. The point of the precision strike isn't to knock him out cold, but to keep him from activating his ability. Presuming Ekko would be actively defending his neck or his heart, a liver shot would be a great alternative to a more decisive blow.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"SIim Jesus","date":"2018-10-05T10:34:34.322+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Exactly this.

He may not even know he's been targeted, but hopefully his Zaun upbringing has given him a healthy dose of reasonable paranoia.  In that case, maybe he doesn't expect Camille, but he expects _someone_.\n\nSo we have two characters who are brilliant but very different.  Camille is an Intelligencier - she gathers information, identifies weak-points and leverage points, and then surgically strikes them.  Ekko is a creative genius who excels at identifying solutions where no-one else could (and with resources that no-one else would think to use).\n\n{{champion:245}} \nIf Ekko suspected he was a target, he would creatively try to solve that problem.  First, he'd try to protect his parents - Zaun would have taught him that when people fight dirty, they'll go at you sideways.  HOW he'd protect his parents is another question, but it's definitely something he'd need to do.  Maybe he'd sell some inventions to get them a small house somewhere quiet in Piltover.  Maybe he'd 'accidentally' win a vacation for them to somewhere nice in Ionia or a beach in Shurima, until things blow over.  Maybe they'd be gifted some hand-me-down looking new coats that are secretly lined with armor of his own invention, or shock defenses or something.  Maybe he'd fake their deaths - not uncommon in Zaun.\nSecondly (that is, if he doesn't think his friends are also in danger - if he does, then he'd try to protect them first too) then he'd be on high alert.  He'd likely trap every location that he visits, and have his Z-Drive on speeddial.  He might, if he was especially scared, set up a way to automatically trigger it while he sleeps - so he gets a full night sleep, but to everyone else, he's always awake.\n\n{{champion:164}} \nIf Camille perceived Ekko as a threat to the status quo, she'd research the ever living heck out of him first.  Identifying where he goes, who he's friends and family with, if he has enemies, if he has debts, vices, a moral code - anything that could be a point of leverage.  However!  After all that research, I actually believe that Camille's preferred method would be the direct, surgical, strike.  If there was a way of putting Ekko back in his place (losing his job, or being publicly ridiculed, rebuilding after an accident, or having to support a family member) or If she believes that the death of Ekko would cause even more upheaval (if he became a martyr figure, for example) then I don't think she'd kill him.\nIf he cannot be 'corrected' without death, and his death wouldn't cause a worse situation, then she'd attack head on.  She'd watch him for days (either herself or more likely her agents) and probably locate and disarm all his traps - making sure they still look operational.  She'd assume that she's missed several traps and prepare accordingly.  Likely she'd attack from above or below - human beings are terrible at predicting threats from those directions.

First, he&#x27;d try to protect his parents - Zaun would have taught him that when people fight dirty, they&#x27;ll go at you sideways.  HOW he&#x27;d protect his parents is another question, but it&#x27;s definitely something he&#x27;d need to do.  Maybe he&#x27;d sell some inventions to get them a small house somewhere quiet in Piltover.  Maybe he&#x27;d &#x27;accidentally&#x27; win a vacation for them to somewhere nice in Ionia or a beach in Shurima, until things blow over.  Maybe they&#x27;d be gifted some hand-me-down looking new coats that are secretly lined with armor of his own invention, or shock defenses or something.  Maybe he&#x27;d fake their deaths - not uncommon in Zaun.\n> Secondly (that is, if he doesn&#x27;t think his friends are also in danger - if he does, then he&#x27;d try to protect them first too) then he&#x27;d be on high alert.  He&#x27;d likely trap every location that he visits, and have his Z-Drive on speeddial.  He might, if he was especially scared, set up a way to automatically trigger it while he sleeps - so he gets a full night sleep, but to everyone else, he&#x27;s always awake.\n> \n> {{champion:164}} \n> If Camille perceived Ekko as a threat to the status quo, she&#x27;d research the ever living heck out of him first.  Identifying where he goes, who he&#x27;s friends and family with, if he has enemies, if he has debts, vices, a moral code - anything that could be a point of leverage.  However!  After all that research, I actually believe that Camille&#x27;s preferred method would be the direct, surgical, strike.  If there was a way of putting Ekko back in his place (losing his job, or being publicly ridiculed, rebuilding after an accident, or having to support a family member) or If she believes that the death of Ekko would cause even more upheaval (if he became a martyr figure, for example) then I don&#x27;t think she&#x27;d kill him.\n> If he cannot be &#x27;corrected&#x27; without death, and his death wouldn&#x27;t cause a worse situation, then she&#x27;d attack head on.  She&#x27;d watch him for days (either herself or more likely her agents) and probably locate and disarm all his traps - making sure they still look operational.  She&#x27;d assume that she&#x27;s missed several traps and prepare accordingly.  Likely she&#x27;d attack from above or below - human beings are terrible at predicting threats from those directions.

She ends the fight immediately or retreats to plan a new angle of attack. This is basically my reply to the above comment as well, and indeed the vast majority of pro-Ekko votes here. Everyone is giving Ekko the benefit of a fair, stand-up fight. Even then I'd give Camille the edge because she near perfectly judges distance, positioning and timing to deliver strikes with pinpoint accuracy in every sense of the word. Ekko lacks the sheer combat wit to stand toe-to-toe with her, no matter how many times he goes back. He just plain lacks training.\n\nBut more importantly, we shouldn't give him the benefit of a stand-up fight, because Camille most certainly would not. Assuming he was the one seeking _her_ out, maybe they'd go toe-to-toe, but the lore pretty much establishes that Camille is the hunter, never the prey.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Infernape","date":"2018-04-26T23:02:29.268+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean, Ekko could just go in time indefinitely until he figures out how to beat her.
