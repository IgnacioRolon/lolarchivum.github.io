You gotta shot call probably.  Make sure you translate your leads into barons/dragons/heralds.  If you dominate your lane use the space. \n\nI've had several games in recent history where I decisively won my lane and dominated mid game.  However, I ended up losing to not making Baron calls fast enough. Sometimes being even 15 seconds too slow on a call will decide the game.  \n\nThe good news is if what you say about your stats are correct then you have your micro level game play down.","replies":[]},{"poster":"In2TheRainYires","date":"2018-08-25T15:03:58.418+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The reason you aren't winning game is because only 1 thing in this game really matters right now... damage. In earlier seasons you could win games by simply ward placements, having good map awareness, focusing on objectives, good macro play etc. \n\nRight now, none of those things matter as much as being able to outdamage the enemy team. To put it bluntly, if you and your team do not deal more damage than the enemy team, chances are you are going to lose that game. This is frustrating because it does not matter if you do the basics well, more often than not one of your teammates (or yourself) would not be able to keep up with their counterpart.\n\n If you are good enough to hard carry your teammates by dealing just as much damage then you can probably climb. That,however, isn't a playstyle some people enjoy.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Aptest","date":"2018-08-25T11:45:45.063+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Some causes may be: \n1 you tend to score value-less damage on opponents which ramps up you metrics without increasing your win. \n2 you tend to score  value-less kills on opponents which ramp up your metrics without increasing your win.\n3 you put a lot of wards in useless locations that don't spot anything which ramp up your metrics without increasing your win.\n4 You CS when you need to be fighting, which which ramp up your metrics without increasing your win.\n5 you don't commit and die when you should, which ramp up your metrics without increasing your win.\n6 you participate minimally and cowardly in skirmishes which nets you useless assists, which ramp up your metrics without increasing your win (because your allies die and you are not able to capitalize on your damage due to their deaths).\n7 you're talking completely BS and what Thimes is saying is the correct situation.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SDhrek","date":"2018-08-25T08:38:41.975+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The large majority of players while they might get fed, they just don’t know how to close out games, or how to use there advantage they get from lane phase.\n\nSometimes yes it’s your team, but overall, playing again and again with a single champion, didn’t quite look at your history, if you are playing other champions that can really turn things in another direction, even if you play well with one champion.\n\nIt took me a while to get out of gold, but I did it by just playing my best champion, over, and over, and over again, and I just climbed to platinum surprisingly easily, it felt like just, “oh, okay.” And I was able to learn more about the game on the one champion, and that flat out improved my play with everyone else.","replies":[]}]}
