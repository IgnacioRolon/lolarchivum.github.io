They're fun, creative, and such different takes on the characters. Sci-fi and oh-my-god Robots, have been done ad nauseum, and at a certain point they blur together or we become so numbed to them that they don't excite us anymore. That's why I think skins like these, and Coven, KDA, Cooking Masters, Dark Waters, April Fools, and other such off the wall skin lines are refreshing breaths into the game. I think the game definitely needs more unique skin lines, as well as a lot more goofy, punny skin lines because those kinds of things really appeal to players on a whole different level than the done-to-death sci-fi and robots.\n\nOn a side note, I think Camille would work AMAZINGLY well for Papercraft (she brings her own scissors), and if you ever tried revisiting them again, she'd do much much MORE AMAZINGLY well for Sewn Chaos (the scissors, and thread spools).","replies":[]},{"poster":"MOLTinaTOR","date":"2019-02-07T06:55:02.598+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> &lt;3 that&#x27;s so nice of you all to say, thank you so much!!
