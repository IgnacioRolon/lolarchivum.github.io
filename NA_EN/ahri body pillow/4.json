This basically forbid any forthgoing political conflicts which happened directly in the world. That whole Ionian campaign from Noxus? Nope, just a set of matches for summoners to play to know if Ionia has to give Noxus some land or not.\n\nNot to mention that weirdly, even if these matches were supposed to solve political conflicts in Runeterra, summoners _borrowed aliens_ for these games.\nAnd the hilarious part: basically **everything that wasn't human** was automatically alien.\nYordles? Aliens, they even prayed to a god damn mothership.\nAnivia? Alien from some ice phoenix planet.\nMalphite? Alien from a planet with living rocks.\n**Even god damn Kayle and Morgana were aliens from an angel planet**.\n\nI fail to see how a world, which reduces complex political crisis to a **sport**, can have more meaning in your eyes than what we have now.\nHow a world, which decided that anything mildly different is automatically alien, is better than a world which shows that the world is complex and inhabited by different beings coexisting.","replies":[{"poster":"GreenKnight","date":"2019-07-05T10:42:28.355+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":7,"body":"So you are not familiar with retcons?

Seems like riot changed their minds rather quickly about what they wanted Ori to be.\n \nOrianna, the champion, wasn't a professional dancer in the old lore. She was a robot like Blitz. \n\nThe original story was that the real Orianna, the father's daughter, who was talented in dancing, wanted to join League and died during a training session. The father made Orianna, the champion, from metal and was named after his daughter, hence, being the \"clockwork\" girl. This Orianna joined League in the dead one's place to fulfill her \"father's\" wishes. She is soulless and mimicks what the \"real\" Orianna would do. If you look into her Judgement story, she does not have humanity, yet tries to understand what it is, either figuratively or literally (\"taking them apart\"). \n\nThe current iteration of Orianna does not have humanity either, having given away the last bit of her, the literal heart, to her father so that he could live. She is not a cyborg. She is fully robotic. The issue with this story is that they didn't write the reason behind why she is with League, which complicates things.\n\nBoth are tragic stories and both versions are striving to find what/who they are in Runeterra.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Totallynotabot","date":"2019-07-05T19:01:47.830+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Ahri Body Pillow,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=rcLxFl3X,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2019-07-05T05:06:40.540+0000)\n>\n> Dont do what?
