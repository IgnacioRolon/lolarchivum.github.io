The Honor Capsules drop randomly as you play at Lv 3 Honor or higher, but you don't get a guaranteed one once you Level Up. You should happen upon one soon though long as you keep being positive! ^^\n\nAs for the chests, remember that the only way to get chests is by playing a Champion who you haven't earned one with yet this season, and having either you or a premade buddy get an S- or higher! Key shards might drop from Honor and Capsules, however chests don't. My best suggestion is trying out some new champions and seeing how you like them, then trying to get S' on the ones you enjoy. :)","replies":[{"poster":"FlayBoi","date":"2017-08-06T07:08:19.064+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have been honor 3 for a full week now,  playing 5 to 15 games a day pretty much and have not received an honor capsule yet.  I was wondering if there was a set max time or number of games where it would guarentee to give me one. Thanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Son of Ornn","date":"2017-08-06T21:04:21.480+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As far as I know there isn't a max amount of time between when you get Lv 3 and a capsule dropping as they are meant to be random. They shouldn't be sparse, but they're definitely not as common as key frags so I can see why it might feel like they take a while. ><","replies":[]}]}]}]}
