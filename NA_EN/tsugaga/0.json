{"poster":"Tsugaga","date":"2016-12-21T06:52:09.272+0000","title":"Riot Please Read/Fix Bugs Posted In Report A Bug","subforum":"Report a Bug","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"I see the same bugs posted in this section daily/weekly/monthly with no fixes. I&#039;m not talking about weird/random ones, but the ones which can be reproduced 100% of the time and have been posted daily for months. If there is nobody dedicated to this section then why should people bother even posting here to try and improve the game? I really don&#039;t mind if Riot is just too busy, what I mind is a useless Boards/Sections which baits millions of players into spending millions of hours posting issues which Riot doesn&#039;t read. Best/most played game in the world yet the Boards just seems like a hangout and troll grounds.\r\n\r\nTo ward off delete happy mods, I refer &quot;Incorrect IP displayed (according to shop, I have less IP than displayed)&quot; and &quot;ARAM Reroll Not Refunded When Someone Dodges (refunded after relog)&quot;.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2017-01-03T20:35:55.461+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Tsugaga! \n\nI wanted to hop in this thread to explain a few of the concerns you've mentioned. \n\nLike many companies (and colleges), we also took a bit of time off for the holidays, which meant many of us weren't here, and weren't checking/replying to the boards much. So, if you weren't seeing a bit of activity, that's why! \n\nYou're correct that there isn't one person solely dedicated to this, or any particular board. Each team is responsible for checking sections and investigating issues as they arise. \n\nWe do read the issues that come up, however, there are many duplicate reports that come in, and we generally only respond to the first post we see. Unfortunately, there isn't an easy way to flag posts as read/responded to, aside from tracking comments in the red tracker, or looking up a particular Rioter's profile. \n\nThere may also be cases where an emergent issue (such as Dark Star Thresh last year) comes up and rather than replying to several threads, we're actively working on fixing the issue, and put a ticker up in the client, which is a place where more people would see the announcement, compared to the boards. \n\nWhile a bug may be reported, they may not be fixed for a while, due to the priority of the issue. Gameplay issues will always take priority over a visual issue. So, something minor like Hextech Janna missing the glow on her staff would be a pretty low priority, as compared to a particle being difficult for colorblind players to see. \n\nWhile I can't speak to if x, y and z are known issues in many cases (I'm skins specific in terms of knowledge), I do know that the ARAM Reroll bug you're reporting is a known issue, and from the looks of the ticket, it's something that should be resolved in 7.1, if all goes according to plan. \n\nThe IP issue is a legacy issue (not sure if it carried over to the new client), and something I don't believe has a solve for at the moment. Again, it's not something my team works on, so there may be context there that I don't have.\n\nPlease don't assume things. ^-^ We do care, and many of the issues resolved have been reported on these boards.","replies":[{"poster":"Modi","date":"2017-01-04T03:14:14.940+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Would it be possible to have a curated list of known issues (and possible workarounds) pinned to the top?

For larger issues (such as the reconnect issue you'd seen a patch or two ago), it'd be a bit easier for us to pin a post with info on what's going on and what a workaround would be in that situation.","replies":[{"poster":"LostFr0st","date":"2017-01-04T17:36:14.261+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know it isn't live, but what about the Pbr tool?

I'm not sure, since it's not something I'm wicked familiar with, but it may be cool to either search existing bug reports via a search tool, or have it compile some kind of list. Hmm. I can poke the people who work on the tool and toss the idea their way! :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"beany","date":"2017-01-04T17:12:50.041+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Pardon the hijack, but have you seen this thread http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report/OENEZn2E-comprehensive-list-of-all-of-jayces-removed-assets ?
