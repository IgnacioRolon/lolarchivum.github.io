The countdown will hit zero and then everything will freeze. That or the AFK checker doesn't even pop up anymore. I've repaired multiple times and had this problem a month ago and it has made me lose quite a bit of LP, so if anyone else is having this issue let me know.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-15T20:55:55.871+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Champion select relies on a service called PvP.net to give you notifications and keep you synced with the matchmaking room. If for some reason your connection to this service is unstable, it can cause you to miss queue notifications, delay actions in champ select, or even cause timeouts in champ selects. These issues are often caused by network settings that are local to your PC, so I recommend going through our [connection troubleshooting guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) as a first step.\n\nLet me know if your issue persists through those changes.","replies":[]}]}
