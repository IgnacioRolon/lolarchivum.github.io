This only happens during that time and I don't know what to do about it, it's really annoying and I already tried re-installing / doing all the other \"Stuck Authorizing\" tips admin keeps giving people even though it keeps not working. Does anyone know what I should do?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-28T20:45:15.411+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't want to jump to any conclusions, but it kinda of sounds like that might be happening from your ISP doing a quick reset nightly. Crashing in champion select is almost always caused by your connection cutting out for a split second. If you can, call your provider really quick to ask if there's any regular maintenance going on around those times and let me know what they say!","replies":[]}]}
