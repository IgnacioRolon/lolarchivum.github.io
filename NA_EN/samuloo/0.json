I know people want their roles all the time, but now everyone ONLY knows their one role.  I think people were better players when you had to at least play everything sometimes, instead of trolling once or twice a season when autofilled to support.\n\nThat's one of the things I always thought would be nice to actually have on profiles and visible somewhere in game as well.  An icon for every lane, and then those icons would appear either in champ select or on your summoner profile stating your top 3 preferred roles.\n\nNot that the new system isn't nice for getting your role, but it's far from perfect because multiple roles are so over or under utilized.  For example, I like Jungle, Mid, and Support in that order.  If I que jg and mid (I can't que the third role) I get jg essentially every time because mid is so popular.  If I que support and anything I'm going to get support 90% of the time for the same reason.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Zoldren","date":"2018-04-04T00:22:00.988+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just make it so you have to be m5 with 3 chars in each of the 2 spots you 'want'.","replies":[{"poster":"archerno1","date":"2018-04-04T00:25:31.592+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Zoldren,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=r1J8wOEo,comment-id=000200000002,timestamp=2018-04-04T00:22:00.988+0000)\n>\n> Just make it so you have to be m5 with 3 chars in each of the 2 spots you &#x27;want&#x27;.\n\nWhy?

Just playing the champ a fair amount.    And as a new player, you probably should play a lot before you look at ranked.  Unless you want to end up in some Bronze 5 hellhole for the next 2 seasons...\n\n\nAbout the only thing I'd say is that Mastery ranks should take less overall time to gain the more total mastery ranks you have.  Even if just every 1 mastery point was +1% mastery gain, for people who play a lot of champs it would add up to help boost your getting mastery on a select few champs pretty quick (Just 1 game as every champ is +140% mastery gain.  If you somehow got M7 on everyone currently it would be +980% mastery per game for the next new champ).   Because the more you play the game, the better you get overall, even if the difference is only minor.   Someone who has mastered 40-50 champs can probably pick up another rather quickly, while someone who is already struggling on 5-6 champs would struggle on the 7th one too.\n\nAnd as a further point, while higher tiers of mastery should only be available if you own the champ, I do think you should be able to at least trigger the start of Mastery 2 on even free week champs.   This gives new players a way to help build up mastery rank early to enable further build up later on, and can be stated as now that you have played the champ, you have a more basic understanding of the champ's kit that you may not get from just seeing them in action (For instance.  You probably might not realize Ekko has to place his W several seconds ahead of time, and just see the circle and subsequent stun really quick), which has increased your overall understanding of the game.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"datfatguy","date":"2018-04-05T03:24:09.288+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What even was Team Builder?","replies":[{"poster":"Remains","date":"2018-04-23T03:26:27.382+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Teambuilder was basically draft but everybody gets their role chosen.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Beacon Academy","date":"2018-04-04T10:40:45.191+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"A mode where you try to climb with the best of your abilities to prove you deserve to be where you are at...\n\nAnd then I see all the people going \"lol winning is not as important as having fun\"\n\nIf winning isn't a priority, go play in a mode where winning and losing don't matter...

How you gonna learn when you are worrying about many things at once? \n\nRanked experience becomes meaningless when you don't even know left from right on the first time champion you are queuing the match in. Focus on learning the basics and you'll see a better learning curve than when you are jumping into the fray with multiple issues to address.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"T4underbolt","date":"2018-04-03T22:07:28.815+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"Sincerely please uninstall or start respecting other players and don't ruin their games.","replies":[{"poster":"Pumping Iron","date":"2018-04-04T13:53:27.766+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=T4underbolt,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=r1J8wOEo,comment-id=00040001,timestamp=2018-04-03T22:07:28.815+0000)\n>\n> Sincerely please uninstall or start respecting other players and don&#x27;t ruin their games.\n\nWhy should i uninstall?

Ranked has one purpose for existing: to climb the ladder. \nThat by the very definition of its name is why you play it. \n\nIf you are not playing ranked in a way that lines up with the purpose of ranked then you are abusing your teammates who are there for rank's intended purpose.

Also, You CAN'T practice in normals, because \"its just normals\". You'll never find a match that would realistically help you. You CAN however go into ranked and get placed where you belong and improve from there. \"Unless you're plat+ you shouldn't be going to ranked because you hinder your team\".

People who queue up and play like ass because they can't be bothered to properly choose which queue they should be joining are the worst.
