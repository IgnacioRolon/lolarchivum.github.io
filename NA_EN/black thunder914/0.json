I was wondering if you guys are still picking people to sign up for it or you stopped searching. Was also wondering the same thing with the PBE testing as well","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-23T16:28:38.009+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alpha and PBE sign ups are independent, so it would be necessary to sign up for each one individually.  I don't believe any changes have been made to acceptance, so applying should still be good.  I can't make any guarantees or expedite applications, but wish you the best of luck with admissions!","replies":[{"poster":"Black Thunder914","date":"2016-08-25T15:07:23.269+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay sounds good.
