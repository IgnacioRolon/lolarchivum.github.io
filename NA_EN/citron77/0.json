Im Silver 5... BARELY. With the rage monsters/trolls, afk people, or just people having bad games its hard to get ahead. \r\n\r\nWhat i am really upset about it the fact that 5V5 ranked is so hell bent on teamwork that they punish you when one of your team mates goes afk and leaves you to a 4v5... How is that my fault? why do i lose LP for someone with a trash connection? this has happened in at least 1/3 of my games to be honest and its making me dislike league of legends more and more.\r\n\r\nIt could be the most friendly group of players ever! amazing team work! excellent communication! the works. but then someone out of nowhere disconnects and im left losing 20LP/Provisionals/ranking because of their connection... nothing more.\r\n\r\nWhat needs to happen is a loss prevented for everyone that is on the losing side of a 4v5 except for the person that left. that person gets a loss. plain and simple.","replies":[{"poster":"AtheosisX","date":"2014-10-17T23:28:02.721+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"It would seem to me that losses due to AFKs could at least be mitigated in terms of LP loss, while afk/dcs should suffer much more severe LP loss.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jivira","date":"2014-10-17T05:17:28.565+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The problem with straight up loss prevention on that sort of thing is that it's easy to unplug a router. People would do it just to prevent losses. The deterrent would have to be on the side of preventing people with connection issues (or history of unplugging routers) from playing ranked.","replies":[{"poster":"King Rei","date":"2014-10-17T17:03:59.745+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"However the person unplugging would still get the loss as he stated. Even if it was a team mate on a whole 5's team, that one person would fall behind constantly to prevent said loss","replies":[{"poster":"Citron77","date":"2014-10-17T20:25:11.014+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"thanks for backing me Rei but he does bring up a certain point. I mean what if there is a duo in this 5v5 match. One person on the duo is trying to progress in the rankings. While the other person in the duo is just a smurf and is there in case a game goes south. If it goes south the smurf DCs  leaving the main unharmed in the ranking. \n\nBut even then it would not be giving an upper hand. all it would do is just not set back the other 4 people. So IDK maybe this would be a better option than 5 people losing LP because one DC\n\nStill makes me mad that its still my LP being lost when some random dude DCs... i just wish something would be done about that.","replies":[{"poster":"King Rei","date":"2014-10-17T23:13:52.376+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Right I feel you, disconnects make the climb that much harder. I've noticed that people on the team opposite the one with people disconnecting actually start to put forth more effort when they already have a leg up.","replies":[{"poster":"Citron77","date":"2014-10-18T14:37:54.609+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"and it just pisses me off man. cuz it could be a close game and then all the sudden DC and the other team just goes so hard! and then im at fault and lose ip. story of my life right now in silver :/","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Citron77","date":"2014-10-17T15:24:38.537+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"True... i guess you could call it wishful thinking :/","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Darkmind1212","date":"2014-10-17T01:38:59.151+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sadly this will not change. almost 4 whole seasons now and riot is still unable to fix such simple issues.
