I get to be a beta tester, sweet! I didn&#039;t read the whole thing and hit sign up. I assumed it was for android and iOS because maybe there were just more people on android so you named the email android friends app. I clicked sign up and it brought me to the google play store. I was thinking well maybe I can download stuff from the Google Play Store on my iPhone. Nope. I hit sign up and realized how stupid I was. I really wanted to test for you guys and Im really sorry! Just wanted you guys to know I didnt just sign up and not give feedback. Thanks!\r\n\r\nRyman","replies":[{"poster":"Sparkle","date":"2016-01-27T17:41:03.510+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't worry, we won't hold it against you. \nWe'll see you later when the app comes out for both platforms! :D","replies":[{"poster":"ItsMeRyman","date":"2016-01-27T19:11:58.244+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alright, thanks!","replies":[]}]}]}
