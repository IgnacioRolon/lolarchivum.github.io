I know its not my internet or computer, since everything else runs fine. I'm just really irritated that I'm being punished because the game's loading screen is broken. This isn't a patch my client issue because 9/10 games it's fine but that one really seems to screw me over. Please fix this Riot. I'm at the five 20 min queue mark and am seriously considering throwing my keyboard across the room.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-27T18:26:42.812+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even if your internet is fine, it sounds like your network is having problems reaching the game server and marking you as a leaver.  If your connection can't reach the game, the client goes dormant and you'll see a frozen or blank screen.  You'll want to stick to customs for now and run through our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to fix this up, otherwise your [leaverbuster](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ) queue could escalate further.","replies":[]}]}
