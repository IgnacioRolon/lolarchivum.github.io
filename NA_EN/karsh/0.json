The chat during the premade-making has a very similar issue for me.\n\nThe first 2 cases don't let me both see what others type and (as I've asked people I queued with in-game) make so that anything I type also doesn't appear to others.\nThe premade chat makes it so I don't see what the premade-mates type, make it so I don't see the things I do say, but the people in the premade so see what I type.\n\nI've already repaired my Beta Client and the issue still existed without any changes.\n\nDuring the making of this post, I am downloading the Legacy Client once again. Will post an update after I find out if the issue will continue to persist there too.\n\nScreenshots from Coop vs AI Champ Select matches:\nhttp://imgur.com/AjDKfPj\nhttp://imgur.com/nhZCmsJ\n\nEDIT: The Update is here - the chat in the Legacy Client works exactly as it should, the issue exists only in the \"Nearly-non-Beta\" Client, goddammit Rito.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-08T17:31:10.363+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you having any other chat issues outside of that?  There may be a corrupted file with the updated client that failing to get you connected to chat.  I'd suggest running a repair to make sure your data is installed properly and running smoothly.   The repair option is available through the patcher's gear icon, under the General tab.  Let me know how that goes!","replies":[{"poster":"Karsh","date":"2017-03-09T16:24:08.638+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm having no other chat issues outside of those I described. I can message friends as usual, the chat in-game works completely fine, etc.\n\nAs I've said, I already ran the Repair and it didn't change anything. Since yesterday I returned to the Legacy Client because all of the chat functions work as they ought to there, but I am afraid about what's going to happen once everyone is forced to use the new Client. I really hope I won't have that issue anymore by the time that happens.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-09T16:37:33.070+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Indeed, it's important to get this fixed up so you don't run into any issues once that time comes.

So I thought to myself today that it very well might be connected with my issue somehow, considering that, as far as I remember, the option to block/add to friends a bot didn't even exist in the Legacy Client, so it might have been a unique to the Beta Client issue.\n\nSo I went to the list of blocked Summoners and managed to find a single icon without a name attached to it... So I removed it.\nNext game I tried, the issue seemed as if it was completely gone and it most likely is.\n\nTurns out that often times, some rather unexpected things can cause issues in (at least IMO) seemingly unconnected systems of a Client.\n\nWell, thanks for help anyway, heh.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
