I've played on extreme tilt and took it out on someone after me getting flamed game after game after game. Riot punishes me. I get super toxic teams where they all buddy up and blame me for their dumb mistakes, I do nothing, and I get banned. Even have proof. Riot sucks again.

And stop reporting people for calling you a jerk when you ARE one. Geez. Bunch of butthurt babies in this world anymore and I swear half of them play League. Grow up, grow some cojones, and stop being such a baby when you start crap with people. Do some breathing exercises or take a break, but for the love of God stop crying over every little thing.","replies":[{"poster":"Senorown","date":"2015-06-26T07:45:00.380+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=vitalzign,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=JEqwcObo,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2015-06-25T09:15:05.908+0000)\n>\n> I agree on this crap.

Oh and kudos for assuming I antagonized the guy that made the threat. 10/10 Detective work.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Purebalance","date":"2015-02-20T23:29:28.831+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Given the way the punishment system works around here you can expect yourself to get a chat restriction in about a couple days.

I have had someone somehow find out my name and the name of my device I was using during the game shortly after his death threats. I had visual prof of the logs and everything yet after riot responded and told me they would handle the situation I noticed his history is still continuing on even now. So either riot just does not care or they are so messed up internally that they cant handle a simple issue as such.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Senorown","date":"2015-02-20T07:01:51.193+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SynxSpir,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=JEqwcObo,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-02-19T19:22:37.412+0000)\n>\n> I'm not entirely sure on riots stance on death threats, but I would believe they would take it seriously, if you have a screenshot of it, I would wait for there response on it, hopefully something other then a wrist slap would happen.\n\nI did, now all I can do is wait for a response, I suppose.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Senorown","date":"2015-02-19T18:36:14.641+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bumping for some community input.","replies":[]}]}
