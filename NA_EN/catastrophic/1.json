I checked using CMD by pinging 104.160.141.3 (I believe that's the EUW server) and it returns \"Request timed out\", the same goes for EUNE servers, however I can get a response from the NA server 104.160.131.3 \nI started a custom game with bots and I could choose champion but never go past that.\nSo what do I do here? Do I just wait or?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-12T18:01:14.251+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You'll want to use 192.64.170.252 to check your traceroute for EUW.  I recommend downloading [WinMTR ](http://winmtr.net/winmtr-v0-92-now-available/)which provides better information!  It does sounds like your network is being blocked from reaching the game server, and I recommend using our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to troubleshoot it.  I also suggest downloading our [hextech repair tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367) to help make sure your firewall settings are configured.  Hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
