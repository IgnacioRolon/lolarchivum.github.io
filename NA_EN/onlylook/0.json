It took me much more time;)  Can you tell me your secrete?\n\nEDIT:  Sorry Friend I have to be honest!  3 weeks and a level 30 already,  I concur with Riot games.  I find it hard to believe you just started playing, leveled up to 30 find new problems and just got banned by mistake.   I won't go into it here or argue with you.

I have been fighting with the so called \"Player Support Specialist\" and didn't come back here for days. \n\n(https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/29814366?flash_digest=85bec5c69b83e831e069d114d54ed97d44377e84, can you see this page?)\n\nI have to admit I made a mistake by writing \"three weeks\". I checked my emails and find out that I signed up at 2/21/17, got suspended at 4/6/17. As I have been watching Twitch TV for days before the suspension, the correct time should be \"I am new to the game, 4-5 weeks. \"\n\nHowever, I didn't used three weeks to hit level 30. \n\nMy first champion was Miss fortune in the free roll. I was really new to the game. I watched one of my friend played LOL several times before I played it myself, That's all. (Not only to LOL, but all online games, the last game I played myself was Age of Empire. a game might be older than you:) At first match I even don't know how to hit (called AA here) an enemy. And after the next day I purchased new keyboard and mouse, I began to enjoyed the game. \n\nI played really bad. That's why I knew the term of \"autistic kid\". After I played  many matches and owned MF, a kid in high school told me I should know MF's ability combo to play her. He didn't tell me how and I changed to Poppy, I played in Twist Treelines and met some friends, so I kept played there even I lost most of the matches. By using poppy, I hit lvl 30, my poppy's mastery point is 26. \n\nThough can't remember the exact time, I don't think it cost me more than three weeks to hit lvl 30. \n\nI purchased RP to get Darius in 3/21, the last day he was on the free roll, The IPs I gained by playing a free Darius were used to setup a full rune page. \n\nBefore Darius, I played a lot of Quinn, should be several days as I could use the IPs gained to own her. \n\nSo I should have hit lvl 30 at least before 3/10, 17 days from 2/22. That's two and a half weeks.  If I don't remember it wrong, I was invited to a ranked game days before I stopped playing poppy. So actually, I should used 10 days to two weeks to hit lvl 30. \n\nIf let me try again and solely to get lvl 30, I can do it in two weeks for sure. \n\nBTW: I think a better gauge is how many matches played.","replies":[{"poster":"Onlylook","date":"2017-04-13T06:29:02.446+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh, None cheating involved at my part. \n\nI knew \"third party software\" from Riot's email. Before that, I met many bots in normal games of twisted treeline. They have a fake human name (looks like yours but will be \"nergsrrKlLLae\", something you believe at first has a meaning but not after a good guess. no name like \"onlylook\" is used by a bot I met, ) \n\nDuring the game, those bots only attack minions and towers, won't fight to death even when enemy is attacking the last tower, and hey won't vote to surrender. \n\nIf you ever played twisted treeline, you can know how frustrated I was under this kind of situation and how many times I caused Riot as I believed that those bots were created by Riot to make more match available during early morning.\n\nIf I cursed by typing, it is decent for Riot to ban me. \n\nBut, I even won a match with two such kind of bots as teammates. AS in Champ-select no one replied my hearty greetings, I already suspected they were bots. And when I saw two adc went together to the bot line and won't reply my question for strategy, I quickly made a decision to follow them, trying to get some kills during the long and frustrating defeat without surrender as an escape. (I never did AFK even after I vote to surrender. )\n\nSurprisingly, the enemy team grouped together too. They were half a tower ahead of us and this time I won't try to fight them by myself, as I know for sure no teammates would come for a ganking. \n\nThe game went as each team push in a line, no melee or kill. My team was half nexus ahead and won. \n\nWhat a hilarious joke.","replies":[{"poster":"Raysjdy","date":"2017-04-28T14:58:42.553+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you get your account back?","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
