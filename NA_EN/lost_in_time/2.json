Try and do the attacking yourself, you're gonna get your face bashed back into the sands.\n\nYasuo? Just a ranged Yi so far as I'm concerned. Between Wind Wall and his full flow shield he's TOO forgiving on his positioning. He's even allowed to safely ult into the middle of a teamfight because his ult gives him a free shield once again even if he has 0 flow when using it. You know how many other champions can dive into the enemy team and completely mitigate the next source of damage that's going to come at them while being able to dash away and block any following projectiles?\n\nNone.\n\nUntil Nocturne gets a free spellshield when he uses his ult, until Vi's shield can drastically increase the damage it can absorb, until Jarvan can reinforce his shield from ulting the enemy team, Yasuo is being given too much for too little given how much damage is in the rest of his kit. No one should have that much mobility, range, armor shred, damage, and damage mitigation all in one kit for free.\n\nQ Q Q R is not a hard combo but it's all he needs to win teamfights.","replies":[{"poster":"Sypher The Poro","date":"2015-01-06T20:17:52.739+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"There's on major thing you overlooked regarding Yasuo's ult and as someone who plays him I feel the need to correct you:\nYasuo's ult has something that only one other uses, **his ult requires setup**.

In most cases I'd go so far as to say a bullshit hitbox considering I've been caught in the tornado with more than a Teemo between the edge of the tornado and I. That isn't very hard to set up, especially given how low the cooldown on his Q is.\n\nEver tried to ult Yasuo as Lucian?

Vi is also very tanky. Jarvan is also another tanky bruiser.

He doesn't have to contribute after that beyond hanging back and poking, and can very easily get fed off of assists to regain his power during the mid game going into late.\n\n> \n> Thing is, Yasuo can only dash through enemies so he has to be aggressive to be useful.

He has no other forms of protection other than his wind wall and his shield because he is probably the squishiest fighter there is. \n\nYes, so give the guy who has to be aggressive to be useful up to three methods of damage mitigation or completely stopping it, give his sustained damage so much burst that he doesn't have to deal it for more than a second or two, and give him the ability to provide two different CC effects as well. And make it so that he only needs two items to crit every single time he right clicks or Qs someone when ADCs, who's kits revolve around the same concept, have to build three items to guarantee critical strikes and give up on damage to build that third crit chance item when he can just keep right on trucking on damage items.\n\n> \n> Do you know why Yasuo gets a free shield on ult?

He only builds bruiser if he's falling behind. Vi is tanky, but she isn't getting as much free damage mitigation for diving someone as Yasuo has access too, even with her passive shield. She isn't blocking the next damaging ability or negating the next several that come at her. Jarvan isn't either. Building tanky is what allows them to survive the engagement, but it's stacked in Yasuo's favor when he can build more damage and mitigate so much that he doesn't even take any on his way back out before his team crashes down on you.\n\n> \n> And I'd like to see you do a 3-5 man Yasuo QQQR Combo in any Elo above Silver.

I could keep going on.\n\nYi is reducing the damage dealt, not completely cancelling it. Trynd risks dying the moment his ult ends, and it's easy to make him waste it.\n\n> \n> You can learn his combos just like you can learn Azir's combos but it doesn't change the fact that it is very difficult and tedious to execute them unless you were extremely fed early in which case any champion is easy to play as.\n\nE four times through a minion wave then E through the enemy laner to deal maximum harass damage. Do so with full flow and it's free harass on them. Q twice on minions and then send a third Q at the enemy laner to poke them. Please excuse me while I get try to process how insanely difficult it is to press the same button multiple times. Azir's combos require careful positioning of both his soldiers and himself. Yasuo's combos require something with a red health bar to be somewhere nearby. They aren't the same, and unlike Yasuo, with Azir you get punished by losing your ability to escape or mitigate damage with his shield if you make a bad positioning choice. Yasuo can get caught out and still get away between his high mobility and two different ways of negating damage from chasing enemies.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"MattAkhavan","date":"2015-01-07T07:17:32.025+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":7,"body":"Sona \nhas safe harass\nsafe CC\nsafe shield\nheals\nmovement speed buffs\nand AOE cc\n\nsona > lee sin in every way in support role.","replies":[{"poster":"Elphrihaim","date":"2015-01-07T07:47:02.318+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=I Am Animation,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=uYUE15Aj,comment-id=000000000003,timestamp=2015-01-07T07:17:32.025+0000)\n>\n> Sona \n> has safe harass\n> safe CC\n> safe shield\n> heals\n> movement speed buffs\n> and AOE cc\n> \n> sona > lee sin in every way in support role.\n\nBut Nami > Sona in support.\n\nThe point of the thread, however, is that there is a large amount of community backlash for nerfing Sona.\n\nBut Lee Sin had proposed nerfs that were taken away due to community backlash. \n\nSo why does Lee Sin get special treatment in that regard?","replies":[{"poster":"MattAkhavan","date":"2015-01-07T08:43:55.634+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":7,"body":"i don't agree with this either.

It's because the views and opinions expressed by individual Riot staff members does not necessarily reflect that of Riot as a whole.
