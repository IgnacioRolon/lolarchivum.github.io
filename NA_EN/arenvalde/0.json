They get to start customizing their build path, not just after gp10 item, sightstone, and boots, but they get to customize their build before they even get sightstone!\n\nHell, you could even let jungle items or tier 2 items like {{item:3135}}, {{item:3035}}, and {{item:3075}} upgrade with sight enchants and let everyone play the vision game, which was the main reason for introducing trinkets and sightstone in the first place, wasn&#039;t it?","replies":[{"poster":"5000000000000000","date":"2015-05-05T07:25:44.684+0000","up_votes":21,"down_votes":1,"body":"This would mean that the active from the support item will be removed. It will either become an aura or moved to another item. I'm okay with that. I also really like the enchantment idea.\n\nI have a concern regarding cost efficiency, though.\n\n{{item:1028}} + {{item:1006}} = 580g (220g more for 800g)\n{{item:1027}} + {{item:1004}} = 580g (220g more for 800g)\n{{item:1052}} + {{item:1004}} = 615g (205g more for 800g)\n{{item:1036}} + {{item:1051}} = 720g (80g more for 800g)\n\nThis means that if the sightstone cost is still at 800g, the ward passive will be really cheap. It's currently 400g (which I find reasonable, as it breaks even at placing 6 wards), but it can become as low as 80g (which breaks even at 2 wards).\nA way to mitigate this will be raising the price of sightstone. If we maintain the passive cost efficiency as 400g, then the most expensive sightstone (the AD option) will be 1120g. This is pretty difficult to purchase. I think maintaining the recipe as item+(about 400 gold)=sightstone is a good idea. My suggestion therefore is\n\n{{item:1028}} + 400g = Sightstone (+150 Health)\n{{item:1027}} + 400g = Sightstone (+200 Mana)\n{{item:1036}} + 440g = Sightstone  (+10 AD)\n{{item:1052}} + 365g = Sightstone (+20 AP)\n\nThey are all 800g in total.

But I feel like rather than alter the trinket's effect by adding the sightstone, we end up almost losing the sightstone. as much stronger as those trinkets you suggested are, I don't necessarily want to only drop a 60 sec ward where i've swept - maybe i want to sweep outside of drag pit and drop my invisible ward inside drag pit. \n\nAs someone who builds sightstone religiously - even on junglers and toplaners - I'd rather get a bit more out of the sightstone than end up opening the slot - I build sightstone because i'm gonna have a slot full of wards anyway, might as well get 400 health for 'free'. If i could get more out of it, great. (800 health is nice on tanks, but i'm not finishing ruby on anything else until i've got full build.)

Your system just feels like different flavors of cookie cutter to me rather than presenting actual build diversity.  Hell, once upon a time gp10 was still a real choice too - it wasn't automatic that you'd buy 1 (and only 1) gp10 on support.

The jungle is currently being dominated by cinderhulk junglers, with cinderhulk being so strong it's showing up in top lane. When cinderhulk was juggernaut, the warrior enchant was dominating the jungle, with vi and lee sin being a step ahead of the other junglers at all stages of the game. Devourer is okay on some junglers, but clearly suboptimal, and poachers seems to only work on Nunu.\n\nRight now the support meta picks are determined by who can bring the most utility for the adc. If the sightstone system is changed to an enchant system, it could artificially shift the meta in the same way the jungle items have. Probably one enchant would be completely useless, except maybe on one champ. One enchant would be mediocre. One enchant would be decent, and the last enchant would be the meta enchant that everyone feels is the strongest. Champs who use the strongest enchant well would become significantly stronger while champs who don't would become weaker.\n\nFor example, two of your new proposed sightstones have mana regen (one with mana, one with ap). This means that mage supports like morgana and annie start building their ap items sooner (assuming no changes to upgraded sightstone costs, gp10 item costs, and a small combine cost, like the jungle items) and they get to have an extra ap item (cough mejais cough). Sure, leona and thresh get to build another tank item, but mage supports would be able to snowball their leads without having to sacrifice warding by opting for the \"no sightstone, upgraded yellow trinket\" route. We might see zyra and even brand or ryze come to bot lane, until riot decides they need to make adjustments and buffs the health enchant, resulting in a tank support meta where mage supports are practically useless, or at least starting from behind.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zavern","date":"2015-05-05T07:02:59.514+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"The Sightstone and a GP/5 item to make a new item sounds absolutely amazing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hakkuza","date":"2015-05-06T03:08:11.713+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"How about instead of combining with the support item, it combines with warmogs?

What's the deal man why do i have to be punished with no gold in lane for wanting to play a squishy support?","replies":[]},{"poster":"41noob","date":"2015-05-05T23:13:05.877+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"what support item issue? sight stone is super strong on its own, it really doesn't need buffs.","replies":[{"poster":"Arenvalde","date":"2015-05-06T00:35:58.083+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Supports currently are building 1 tier 3 item and two tier 2 items (sightstone & boots) before they are able to make unique choices about their build-path.  Riot doesn't like this and is looking for solutions.  By folding the sightstone INTO the tier 3 item, you save the support gold, build-time, and a slot space.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"winnie de pooh","date":"2015-05-05T06:55:46.393+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"This would change sightstone in an all role pick. If you would make this change not only the suport would pick it up also the other players would go for it. (If you are smart ofc) I think this would change the support role way to much i'm not a fan of this idea. It's just much more fun that you have to keep buying wards as a top or mid laner while you have to make a choice to go for the items or a ward :)","replies":[{"poster":"Occams Raiser","date":"2015-05-05T21:37:49.613+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"An adc would buy thin in lieu of what full build item?","replies":[]}]}]}
