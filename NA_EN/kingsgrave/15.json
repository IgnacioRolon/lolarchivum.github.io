I don't think Riot understands what they are saying here. Let me tell you all the many ways they are vastly incorrect here.**\n\nSpecific section I'm replying to is from here: http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/riot-games/announcements/riot-pls\n\nYes playing League will help you get better, but that alone will not unless you just happen to be a god of analyzing your mistakes, or like most you have friends to buffer off of. I started stagnating once I didn't have friends to play with on a regular basis, so I have a lot of trouble improving. I wouldn't be surprised if that's the case for a lot of people. \n\nSo I guess that Riot thinks it's illogical for literally every other competitive game, video game or otherwise, has things in place to allow you to practice outside of just playing the game.\n\nStreet Fighter has a training mode with techniques and specific scenarios to help you perfect one specific technique. As soon as you are done you immediately go into a live match and try it out against a real opponent without controlled variables. You continue to do this until you reach the benchmarks you want, and beyond. **Every single Fighting Game pro or casual plays Training and then goes into a Live match if they want to understand the game better. I fail to see how Street Fighter is/or should be any different than League/**\n\nBasketball and Gridiron/Football and Soccer/Football all have their players regardless of skill level constantly practice drills to perfect technique and mentality. Just outright playing a lot of games alone won't always improve your understanding of the game or your technique/skill, if anything it could be worse for you since you will just embed your errors. **Every single Sport has casuals and pros training and learning techniques with the help of others in an IRL sandbox mode to help them perfect technique and understand the game better, I fail to see how this is/or should be any different than League.**\n\n> \"We want to make sure weâ€™re clear: playing games of League of Legends should be the unequivocal best way for a player to improve. While there are very real skills one can develop in a hyperbolic time chamber, we never want that to be an expectation added onto an already high barrier to entry\"\n\n**First off:** The Hyperbolic Time Chamber outright vastly improved the Z Fighters power levels because they worked in pairs. This led to Goku/Gohan discovering how to perform SS2 and better understand their power and how to perfect their methods. Even earlier in the series before the HBTC, Gohan, an incredibly weak kid with a pathetic understanding of fighting, trained with Piccolo, an experienced fighter, and **BOTH OF THEM IMPROVED AT A RIDICULOUS RATE AND LEARNED NEW WAYS OF LOOKING AT FIGHTING.** \n\nDid the Rioter who wrote this look at DBZ and go \"yeah training is way too hard for anyone that isn't them and there is no way it has ever helped weaker people\" I just don't get it.\n\n**Secondly:** The idea that a training mode will make the game more difficult to get into is absurd. **How would the ability to learn techniques with volunteer player coaches and higher Rank friends outside of overly stressful 5v5 pvp matches make the game harder or the barrier to entry greater?** I really don't understand that. \n\nFor me and many others that have played Chess competitively, it was stressful trying to learn it just thru trial and error. We felt like we weren't going anywhere unless we just happened to be the best at analyzing why we were losing. When we finally just picked up books and techniques on various openings and strats we improved FAR faster than ever and we were far less stressed while learning more beyond that, which made the game more enjoyable and us better players overall and teachers for future players.\n\n**Third and Finally:** \"The expectation\" to train is going to be natural and inherent to literally every single competitive game. Odds are if they are playing normals they won't think about training mode at all even if it's available. However, they will see it and try it and perhaps they will get decent enough that they decide to go into Ranked and try out their new found skills. If someone plays Ranked, the odds are high that they will see Training as natural as Breathing and look at every lost game and focus on what they needed to fix, and go fix it with a friend or a coach/mentor. **This idea that a training mode would scare people and put pressure on them is ridiculous.**\n\n**If you don't want to make a Sandbox mode that is 100% fine, just tell us you don't want to make it yet and it's not a priority. Just don't lie to us with explanations you haven't really thought about or use terms/references you don't understand.**","replies":[{"poster":"Syndrarella","date":"2015-08-05T23:51:52.865+0000","up_votes":46,"down_votes":4,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"TraakSC","date":"2015-08-06T00:40:55.722+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"People in Cali are having the same connectivity issues as everyone else.","replies":[{"poster":"46104328_DEL","date":"2015-08-06T01:04:31.007+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":12,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=TraakSC,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=BoXj3u8n,comment-id=00030000,timestamp=2015-08-06T00:40:55.722+0000)\n>\n> People in Cali are having the same connectivity issues as everyone else.\n\nOh, Cali, no wonder you're such a childish prick.\n(This is a joke, I'm sure there are plenty of Cali people who are great guys and gals..just not this shit.)","replies":[{"poster":"TraakSC","date":"2015-08-06T01:09:00.472+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"What?

DBZ's HBTC is literally proof that you get better by training in an isolated environment. Saying \"We don't want a HBTC\" is basically saying \"We want most of the player base to suck. It makes it easier for the balance team.\"\n\nThe worst part of this is that for mid, top, and bot the lane phase portion of the HBTC exists in customs. You can lane up to 7-10 minutes in a HBTC in a custom if you want to try it. Junglers can't neither can you HBTC team fights because of the way the game functions right now. You cannot HBTC builds and have everyone start at a gold break point. It's boarder line insane.

Going one step further, you could even allow players to make their own maps (like skillmaps). Yes, that doesn't seem to really fit LoL, but a lot of games where it doesn't seem to fit have it and they're REALLY popular. It also invites another type of players to this community who don't like to play regular PvP matches.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Taarki","date":"2015-08-06T13:14:23.842+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Playing games of league won't help as much as a sandbox mode on stuff like last hitting.\nHowever, playing games of league helps WAY MORE with stuff like lane matchups and team synergy between champions.","replies":[{"poster":"Champion Skin","date":"2015-08-06T13:52:14.204+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sandbox mode is also good for practicing difficult wall jumps or combos (more control over cooldowns less pointless waiting??) or jungle optimization in clearing (being able to reset levels and or jungle camps?)","replies":[{"poster":"Taarki","date":"2015-08-06T14:53:01.918+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That would certainly be a thing that sandbox mode is better at allowing players to do. \nRito why no Taric VU?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2015-08-06T11:37:14.955+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe there's just a difference in definition between the developers and players. \n\nTrue, sand box mode does mean total customization, which is how DoTA first developed as a mode off warcraft. **But I think the majority of the player base just want to practice within an environment that is  not fast paced and stress free.**  I want to be able to practice  like mechanics wall flashes, wall wards (hi scarra ward), get a feel of level 3 ultimates (hi2u max range bard ult) or to get a feel of mid / late game item builds (like \"how well does sated devourer work with ... teemo ...\" or just how well a off-meta build work). \n\nSorry Rito, I'm just a bronzie and I don't have the insight like the pros to see whether something is good. I want to be able to feel it out. I do want to get better, and I don't mind grinding just to test things and get better mechanically. \n\nAs a bronzie, its hard to analyze things in the middle of a game where everything is so fast and I can't keep up. Heck, I can't even CS properly, it takes me 20 minutes to get an IE just to see whether that is feasible on a certain champ named Zed, I really don't want to take it to a match making game, where I'll suck even more and take 30 minutes just to get an IE, just to find out it doesn't work and in the meantime, I'll have put 4 of my teammates in negative experience. \n\nIn fact, it took me around 40 minutes just to find out that Randium Omen's passive stacks with Frozen heart and another AS debuff (Hello Malphite), and that Frozen mallet stacks with MS debuffs (hello again Malphite). I don't have the mechanical skill to look at all those things in the middle of a heated live battle,  but ever since I did that, I know when to pick Malphite (hello Yi / Vayne) and my win rate has Sky rocketed on Malphite. **I would love it so much more just to be able to test that in 4 minutes rather than 40 minutes.**\n\nI really don't need to change skins / maps / skills / and customize everything in game like a real sand box mode does. **I just want 80% CDR, +$10,000, spawn at certain levels, and maybe ... fast spawnning jungle / neutral objectives.**","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tusutaki","date":"2015-08-06T08:32:32.011+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">  We want to make sure weâ€™re clear: playing games of League of Legends should be the unequivocal best way for a player to improve.
