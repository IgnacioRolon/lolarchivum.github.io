With the recent change to her E and the obvious bias riot has towards it, honestly it seems like they want Eve to be an on-hit fighter champion.\n\nRight now her build is really weird and she tends to opt for Botrk and things like that anyway, so why not just give her the option to have some amount of kit and build synergy?
