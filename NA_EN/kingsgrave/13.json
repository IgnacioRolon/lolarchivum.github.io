Ahri is much, much more reliable than Brand\n\nBrand vs Ahri, how you seem to think it goes : The enemy team is all sitting in a bush, but they don't know it's warded. Brand's Jarvan promptly E-Q-Rs the whole enemy team, followed by a Leona ultimate. Brand uses his E-W-R combo and gets a pentakill\n\nBrand vs Ahri, what really happens : Brands gets dove at level 6 and dies. Ahri proceeds to gank bot lane and snowballs her allies' lane. While posturing for objectives, she lands a charm on a target and her team deletes said target, creating a favorable situation for Ahri and her team.\n\nI'm exaggerating, of course, but Ahri's inherent safety allows her to vastly outclass Brand, even though he does a SHITLOAD more damage than Ahri.\n\nNow compare Ashe and Varus to Kalista and Graves\nCompare Nautilus to Lee Sin, Jarvan or Vi\n\nChampions with mobility have a massive advantage over immobile champions and they do not pay for it nearly enough.

Even after the changes it will still be very extreme. (I assume it'll get reduced to a .5 delay as well). If he farmed well his single target damage will be enough to rival Leblanc with fewer button presses and less counterplay. \n\nBrand will out damage all 3 of the other mages you listed in a teamfight. Short of a really bored Veigar in a custom game. \n\nMorde's ult keeps his power back. The power it brings to a team is top notch. We'll have to see where his rework takes him. Since his damage is going down in favor of tankiness, maybe he can get something else. He is in fact gaining a gimmicky MS buffs. \n\nDarius also out damages J4 and Gnar while not needing as many damage items(thus can build tankier). \n\nYour ADC comparisons I can agree with to a point though. But you're examples are a bit over the top. \nVarus needs some touch ups. He does bring quite a bit of damage to a teamfight. But a lot of his power is assuming he lands his R. Otherwise you could just bring Kog'Maw to do the same job Varus can. I personally think Varus' ulti should give him a Hurricane effect for 3 AA's at 30/50/70% damage. This will help spread his W and will proc as his R spreads as well. Even if it's a 1v1. Having minions around could make those extra shots give him more HP. \n\nUsing Jinx is a bad example overall. As her and Darius both have combat effected MS buffs. Darius gain 5% MS for each stack of his passive. I'd say she has slightly less utility than Varus while having higher damage to make up for it though. I'd say she is for the most part a balanced ADC and would make a good example of what other ADC's power should feel like. Although this game cannot balance like that. \n\nAnd talking about Kalista is like talking about Cass. Everyone gets hot and bothered and no one really listens. \n\nIMO the real problem with the mobility creep is that it doesn't have any real counters.

Meanwhile Ahri only needs to hit Q (which is pretty easy), since W and R are self-directed and she will dash to get in position to quickly use E, then do the rest of her combo and dash away to secure she doesn't take any risks. Even if all this fails, she has a third dash to secure her again.\n\nNotice how I said teamfight.
