(Many people still choose to \"take the hit\" and play a champion that they enjoy, even if it hurts their chances to win, but that's not really relevant to the argument.)\nBeing able to ban out that champion means that the player is free to choose outside of that small pool.  They aren't forced into \"I have to pick X, because otherwise the enemy will pick Y and I won't be able to deal with it.\"\n\nNow, suppose there is a champion who is just extremely unpleasant to play against.  They might not tend to win, but everyone hates being forced to deal with them.  Maybe their laning phase is oppressive, maybe they force you to build really sub-optimal items to survive them, maybe they force you to pick champions who counter them or be unable to do anything against them.\nThis champion is probably a lot of fun for the player playing him (after all, they are dominating another player), but should his opponents be forced to play against him constantly, despite hating it?  Shouldn't the lost fun of the other players outweigh the fun of the one abusing this champion?\n\nAgain, bans come in here to allow players to avoid the champions that they absolutely don't want to play against, those which completely take the fun out of their gaming experience.\n\n\nThe proper solution is to fix these problems - to bring the overpowered champions into line, to rework the champions whose kits are toxic to play against.\n\nThis simply hasn't happened.\nInstead, the number of \"problematic\" champions has increased along with the champion roster.\n\nBans are the temporary solution to bad balance and bad design, and they need to be there until / unless the balance and design can be fixed, the champions nerfed or the toxic kits reworked.  As more problems arise, shouldn't there be more bans to help overcome the issue?\n\nPersonally, I'd rather see the balance fixed than the number of bans increased, but if that isn't happening, then more bans would be a stopgap solution to avoid the issue and improve the quality of the game experience.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ark Angel HFB","date":"2015-03-11T02:09:59.825+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot ShadowStorm,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=KRMij5G2,comment-id=0000000000030000000300010002000000000000,timestamp=2015-03-11T00:38:38.274+0000)\n>\n> I honestly don't know how much competitive play factors into balance decisions, so can't really speak about that.\n> \n> I was speaking to competitive here since that's what this line of conversation was talking about.

At best you can take out Ziggs, Xerath and Lux out of the middle lane. That still leaves a lot of options for long range poke champions who can siege. Nid, Vel'Koz and Jayce can play the roll. You can pick up good siege champions in other lanes. And they could just as easily pick up a utility mage mid such as Zyra or Orianna. There's also the unconventional options like Kog'Maw and Corki as well who can do the job. Especially if you can get that Kog'Maw past early game. \n\nInstead what we are left with is just picking out what is often the most frustrating champions to face. \n\nMaybe a change to the ban system as a whole needs to be added. \n\nWhat if your team could pick team passives. Different ones that would change how you played your team. Instead of banning champions, you would ban these passives. \n\nThe larger the champion pool becomes the more pointless champion bans become. Without it turning into banning so many champions that each game feels like a part time job just to start it. If Riot wants to create diversity, this would be a good place to start.

[...] Currently this is next to impossible. [...] Instead what we are left with is just picking out what is often the most frustrating champions to face.\n\nThis is a really interesting line of thought to me. I think there's some truth to this, and I like that you had some ideas on how to address it.\n\nI'm not sure we would ever want to support the ability to ban out an entire team comp. But I think it's fair to say bans should let you deal with certain styles of poke comp.\n\nLet's assume Jayce and Nidalee are essentially interchangeable in every poke comp. In that case, yeah, you need to ban both to really accomplish anything (or, ban one pick one). There should be a clear reason why a team picks Jayce instead of Nidalee for your poke comp other than \"this one is just stronger\". Ideally, Jayce slots in because he brings X with his poke, and Nidalee brings Y.\n\nMorello touched on that in an interview recently. In regards to Azir, he said\n\n> Azir doesn't just provide that win team fight value, so you don't have to stack rank him against every other guy who fights. Do I want what Azir brings? Nope, not going to bring him. Do I? Probably want to bring him.\n\nAnd I think that mentality can be expanded to \"Does he bring something that ruins my plans? Probably want to ban him!\" That's where I think this gets interesting. Suddenly, you're thinking about those differences during banning too. \n\nIf Jayce and Nidalee do different enough things within a poke comp that you can say \"hey, let's ban Jayce because our plan just can't deal with X. They might just pick Nidalee, but that's ok, because we **can** deal with her by doing Y.\" That feels more like where we want to be.\n\nI think new champs have been better at having these more unique things they do (reworks and updates too). Lots of old champs need some love though, and important that new champs continue to evolve things.","replies":[{"poster":"Cindikle","date":"2015-03-11T01:50:25.084+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"While this is true. You can also pick a different champion that fills the main thing you are looking for. And fill the missing gap that Jayce had but Nid didn't in another players place. \n\nIf you're looking for a poke mid and choosing between Nid and Jayce, and are OK with facing Nid. Only thing I can think of is that you'd want her ability to get in and burst a target and be able to get out. Jayce cannot really do this. At best he can knock someone back as he runs away. Assuming he didn't need that attack to kill the target. \n\nSo this would mean you can handle Nid going into melee range. But don't want to face Jayce who has more power while staying ranged. Maybe you got Jinx as can she quickly lands a trap, securing Nids death.\n\nIf you're banning Jayce that leaves one of the other listed poke champions that can go mid available. And finding other rolls that can do what Jayce does isn't too hard. Lulu top can be very good at poking, all her power is at range and brings much more utility than Jayce. \n\nBut that too is part of being good at the game. Being able to pick around the bans to still get your ideal team comp. But this too means that each ban is worth less the easier it is to replace what you lost. The higher the champion count becomes, the less meaningful each ban is. \n\nAnd this is just talking one lane that is trying to be banned out. Each lane has decent choices for these rolls. Jungle is about the least flexible one, but i wouldn't exactly count it out. \n\nIn the end, you're left with banning the overly oppressive champions. If you're looking to make your engage comp stronger. You'll probably ban out Nid and Janna as Nid can fill any lane almost well enough to be a threat and Janna is the master of anti-engage. Zyra and Nami are also good bans for the same reason as Janna. \n\nThis is all assuming they will pick a poke comp. Factoring in other comps you'll also need to ban other champions. There just are not enough bans to build your team around. \n\nMid/lower MMR often ban what is considered OP. Or hard for lower skill players to handle(Blitz being a champion much more commonly banned at lower ranks). Higher elo's can maybe build around bans. But they also must ban what CAN be OP. Zed being a very good example of this. You may be able to handle him, but if you face someone who has nearly mastered him you're in trouble. Leblanc being another one. \n\nPro's often end up banning out players instead of comps. But they are the most likely to actually ban a champion because of their comp. \n\nProbably just the way I look at it overall. I don't consider myself a great player or anything and could be missing a big part of it. I overall don't see the real use in how bans are setup. They're rarely used to empower your team. Adding more bans only creates other problems. The more champions we get the more both sides become true. \n\nIf we keep champions bans, I think the best way is to weave it into the picks. Make it so before a champion picks a champion, they pick a ban. When two champions are being picked, it will follow pick order for who gets to ban.

I wouldn't say the game would be healthier, but at least from a LCS viewer stand point, it would be nice to see more than 15ish picks being picked every. single. game. When I see an LCS game with a Lissandra/Morgana/Graves/Zed/Vi against a Rumble/Janna/Ahri/Sivir/Thresh, I instantly close the game, its boring to see the same champions in each game. With more bans, you could potentially ban our 4 of those 10 mentioned champions and maybe see a new champion or 2 creep up. With how slow the balance team has been with containing the \"op\" champions (Hello Lucian! Strong for 9 months straight.) It would be nice to have a small buffer so that I can ban a couple more OP champs.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CrazedPorcupine","date":"2015-03-10T20:09:18.671+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Adding more bans, after 3 people on each team have picked would make it a healthy addition of more bans. This would make the ban phase more strategic focused more on banning out a champ for the comp, and forcing the enemy team to make more strategic choices. The first ban phase would be to ban champs that are problematic you don't want to face at all, while the 2nd ban phase is the strategic bans where you ban champs you think the enemy is going to pick that will fit their comp, so you attempt to stifle their comp rather than a specific player.\n\nDota 2 does this and it works wonderfully.\n\nAlso the way it would go is this\nBlue ban, red ban, blue ban, red ban, blue ban, red ban (total for 6 bans like now.)
