Sure Lee Sin, Rek'Sai, Kha'Zix will sometimes be overtuned and have too high of base damages sometimes but when they are nerfed they are still useful because their kits have useful tools and something to work with rather than \"bleed + aoe damage + slow + pull + execute\"\n\nNerfing scaling on Rek'Sai isn't enforcing \"hurdur bruisers must be tanks\" its making her scaling not so obscene because of the amount of things she can do. They had to nerf the scaling on Darius because all he does is shit on people in lane and does nothing else. Rek'Sai can duel, teleport, has mobility, has meaningful CC, has sustain etc.,","replies":[{"poster":"The Red Warden","date":"2014-12-19T03:18:42.018+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I still wonder though why when they did the Olaf rework they opted to just exchange his stat boosts for other stat boosts when they could have instead given something actually interesting.

All you can do is turtle under tower (which might not even be possible if he's ahead enough) or farm minions where he isn't (in which he does the same and you both keep going until you are both hit lategame and your stats equalize). He's not some squishy ADC who can get caught out of position, stunned and bursted. If he's viable, he can tank a whole team while dishing out a whole team's worth of damage on his own.","replies":[{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2014-12-19T05:09:39.161+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They don't know how to play him usually.\n\nDarius either.

Often, this translates into tons of free stats and steroids (Olaf being the most egregious example, with his three/four separate stat boosts), and more generally a focus on raw stats and reliable fighting power versus more interesting and unique contributions. Going back to the ranged vs melee argument a while back, a lot of melee champions tend to suffer because they either get up close to their opponent and DPS them to death, or just get kited too hard to make an impact, and depending on how tanky they are will always tend to fall into one situation or the other over every game. It's the reason why ranged versus melee tends to heavily favor one or the other over the course of a patch cycle, and why melee top laners tend to suffer against ranged champions. We need each fighter to be able to do something unique besides duel, and have something to bring to the table besides raw tanky DPS. Even super-kiteable champions like {{champion:14}} and {{champion:421}} can make an impact against kite-heavy comps, and bring unique power to their team that no other champion can replicate.\n\nDarius technically has the tools to be a really cool and unique bruiser (he works like a time bomb, something Riot wants to bring out in him in his eventual rework), and Olaf might not even need that many fancy changes to become genuinely powerful and worth picking, but both need to have some outplay potential beyond just getting kited. A big problem with a lot of bruisers is that they're super-reliable, so while they don't have that much variance when it comes to using their spells (you can't really \"miss\" as a bruiser, in most cases), that also means there's a cap to their performance that limits how effective they can be (hence why a lot of bruisers dominate in lane but underperform in teamfights). While reliability can be a form of power, it can become very dull if it doesn't allow for high moments in a champion's kit: right now, there are very few high moments in top lane (pre-level 6, at least), since most fights turn into stat-offs (or slap fights), where the champion with the highest DPS and tankiest stats wins, but either side can just sit back and use their free sustain to heal back. Few abilities are impactful enough to make a lasting mark in top lane, and most bruisers are built to shrug off a large part of the damage they receive. As much as people like to complain about the likes of {{champion:150}} or {{champion:64}} , whenever they initiate a combo, that combo *hurts*, and can't be healed back easily. They're capable of making plays even in lane, and create high moments for both themselves and their opponents. On top of that, they bring power nobody else can copy, whereas it's difficult to differentiate between the contribution a {{champion:36}} makes versus, say, Olaf or {{champion:102}}, despite differences in their kits.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LupusNox","date":"2014-12-19T05:26:25.703+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Olaf and Darius are great 1v1, but suck at everything else","replies":[{"poster":"Kingsgrave","date":"2014-12-19T07:29:24.410+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=LupusNox,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=zKjFLEsQ,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2014-12-19T05:26:25.703+0000)\n>\n> Olaf and Darius are great 1v1, but suck at everything else\n\nAnd they are only good at 1v1s because they make it impossible for you to fight them","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Nubeel","date":"2014-12-19T02:48:58.898+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"Yeah in Bronze Darius and Olaf wreck because people don't know what wards are, overextend and don't understand the concept of \"you just died to a lane bully so don't fight him anymore without help\".","replies":[]}]}
