Fantasy races aren't individual tribes with a couple of no-name dudes, they're species with a culture and society. Having one representative for an entire _species_ feels weird, especially considering yordles, a League exclusive fantasy race, has a ton more representatives than the vast majority of other sentient races in the game. There can't be just _one_ note worthy member of each of these fantasy races; that actually makes the world seem super small and kinda uninteresting. \n\nPlus it's not like they'd just be carbon copies of the other named guy of their species, they can do other things. These races will have a society of their own with their own beliefs and practices, so it's not like they're all pigeonholed in to one thing. If you need an example just look at all the races of WoW, where they have metric crap tons of races, but a bunch of characters in each one, and many of them manage to stand out from the crowd even among their own kind. I mean we can go case by case on this:\n\n- Three of the five remaining Darkin are known to human history in some way, including Aatrox, which means there's at least _two_ Darkin who're important to history and would probably make good characters for exploration and being playable.\n- Trundle's the Troll King and he doesn't have any trusted soldiers among his own kind? No rivals? Nothing else notable standing at the apex of Frost Troll society (as primitive as it is)?\n- I ask the same question of Volibear as I do Trundle; no Ursine warriors he'd have at his side? No rivals among his people?\n- Alistar can't be the only Minotaur who has had any kind of noteworthy history right?\n- Skarner, Nami and Fizz are understandable, but there's still room there to have another of their kind show up.\n\nGameplay and silhouette isn't even as issue because those can change on the whim of the creator. They can have two Brackern and have them incredibly different, I mean look at the Ascended. Look at the Yordles. It just makes more logical sense to have multiple members of a race represented as major characters, if at least one of them _is_ a major character, which is clearly evident given the fact we have champions from those races. For some it makes sense why they're the only ones, like Skarner, Nami and Fizz. For others it doesn't, like Trolls, Darkin or Ursine. If they can make multiple and varied humans, yordles, voidborn and ascendants, then the same should be true for the other races of the League universe.\n\nHopefully I explained that clearly.

He does have the interesting element of stealing the strength of others for his own use but he still really just wants to smash your face in. \n\nSo how do you make another troll who isn't clever but has a different gameplay style to Trundle? I'm not saying this is impossible, just pointing out a difficulty here that I'd like to discuss with you on how to overcome it.","replies":[{"poster":"Sharjo","date":"2015-12-08T17:19:23.456+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Like I said; things are up to the whim of the creator. Considering the variance in weapons and powers available to someone in the Freljord, coupled with the physical capabilities of Frost Trolls, there's certainly avenues of gameplay that can be pursued. How would a troll handle a true ice spear for instance? Perhaps they are of a mystic warband who have reverence to some kind of spiritual beings, and as such can call upon icy magic straight from the land. Perhaps they're a keeper of beasts and call upon animals to help them in a fight, the possibilities are as open as the setting that is the Freljord allows. \n\nAnd let's not also pigeonhole trolls as all being dumb aside from Trundle. While yes, Trundle is a clever and intelligent troll, that's not to say he's the only troll who thinks beyond what to smash. Then there's also age and sex to think about; how are trolls at different stages of their lives? Are they particularly rowdy or weak when they're young? Are older trolls more wizened, but their frailty means they're unlikely to lead? How do female trolls stack up to their male counterparts?\n\nEssentially when thinking about how to explore a fantasy race to a greater extent, you should consider the following:\n\n- Culture\n- Biology\n- Environment\n- Accessible powers\n- Race relations\n- External influences\n\nIf you build up on these things even to a small degree it'll lend to having differentiation right out of the gate. From there these things inform each other; more racial representatives means a greater perspective on this avenue of their culture, which intern strengthens the foundation for further characters.","replies":[{"poster":"GreenLore","date":"2015-12-08T23:59:51.103+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"The thing with another troll is that it just doesn't make sense to add another troll champ from a creative perspective(as in character creation).\n\nEvery champion has something that makes them thematically unique in some way,karthus is a lich,azir is a sand-mage/ra-expy/emporer,lee sin is a monk,etc. and there are barely any champs where 2 have the same archetypes(the only ones where I'd say that would be the case are the kinkou trio who are all ninja,but even then you could make a point about them being a regular ninja,a kunoichi and a lightning master)\nHowever Trundles most outstanding characteristic is being a troll.\nAside from that he also has his \"king\"-identity(he is really the only king in the game,the other leader figures have other titles) and is a brute with a club,but those identities are rather weak(trundle doesn't look like a king and there are other brutish champs in the game as well).\nSo if another troll got into the game then that would kind of devalue trundle,it would make trundle less unique.\n\n\nThats pretty much also the reason why they wanted to make Ao shin,a chinese dragon instead of a european dragon,because they wanted to avoid similarities with shyvana.","replies":[{"poster":"Sharjo","date":"2015-12-09T00:09:07.101+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"The thing is if the thematic overlap was really an issue then we wouldn't have so many bloody champions with ice themed abilities, in fact we wouldn't have champions with an overlap in thematic whatsoever. The point I'm trying to make with this is that from a world building perspective having more than just one notable individual in a race makes logical sense, and that in terms of thematic, silhouette, gameplay and lore, that's all up to the creator; another troll could be so distanced from Trundle that they don't devalue one another, because they are so different despite being of the same kind of people that they don't step on each other's toes.\n\nI mean if I go in to the Dota 2 camp for a second then we can see Axe, Warlock and Disruptor, who are members of the the same race (The Oglodi) but don't crowd the thematic space by being of similar physical dispositions. I mean hell, Warlock looks nothing like an Oglodi but he still is one. \n\nI'm a firm believer that Riot can and should include more members of its already existing fantasy races, and I firmly _disagree_ that having multiple champions from one specific race crowds out the thematic that another champion brings. If those champions do end up becoming inferior then the original who only had \"I am the troll\" or \"I am the armoured bear\" should be built upon further, to solidify more than just that singular element. Trundle's a troll and he has his ice powers. Volibear is an armoured bear and he has his lightning powers. Alistar's a minotaur and a wall of meat.

Season 2 saw 20 champions released.\n\nAlso don't forget he was a brand new Champion Concept\n\n#Light Fighter\n\n**The first of his kind.** What was the 2nd Light Fighter? **Yasuo**. With rework Fiora also becoming a light fighter (although Tryndamere, a much older champ could also be considered one). Now Yas and Fiora are BOTH Fighter/Assassins.  Aatrox is a sustain fighter, and needs to be built tanky otherwise he will just get instantly deleted. He has low base HP/armor and per level. You can't build him straight damage like Tryndamere or Yas. He has insane attack speed, which would benefit from a little crit but crit is a real luxury for him. The only crit I ever built on him was Ghostblade , which was also good because you could use the active after respawning (and respawning makes you LOSE all your Passive Attack speed -which means losing a LOT of damage). But now Ghostblade doesnt have the crit anymore.\n\nI feel they can just buff his defensive stats basically, and move him from Light Fighter to straight Fighter/Tank. There's some argument about whether his passive should be replaced, and with what since it takes up a substantial part of his ability \"budget\". If they do keep it, I feel he should only lose half of his red bar rather than dropping the whole thing. I also feel if you want to play up the \"inspiring\" part of his lore (and yes, many on reveal thought he would have some kind of buff aura) you can add a a team fight aura to his ult.","replies":[{"poster":"Kingsgrave","date":"2015-12-09T07:23:22.564+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Dreamspitter,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=5GXwf7dN,comment-id=001d0000000000000000,timestamp=2015-12-09T02:01:54.863+0000)\n>\n> #Uh......No he wasn't.\n> \n> He was released during_ season 3._  We only had 9 champions that year, which was nothing compared to the near **2 per month solid ** schedule of _Season 2_.

His kit is incredibly flawed. Back when he was broken all they nerfed was his Well AS early game and the damage on his E, and it tanked his winrate and playrate massively. Statcheck champions, which is all Aatrox is, either crush everything or do nothing special all game. There is no real reason to ever pick Aatrox over any other Light Fighter unless he is broken. Everything that all the other light fighters do, he does but not as well. \\\n\n**You can't honestly believe his kit concept is \"brand new\" can you?** \n\nHis W is a fusion of old Sion's E and the plethora of 3 hit AA proc moves that other light fighters have. His Q in concept is just Jarvan's QE combo on one button. His R is a steroid ultimate with an AoE nuke component, and when it was first released on the PBE it was a heal that increased his max HP for the duration. His passive is just an inverse Tryndamere passive. \n\nThey tried to make a drain tank work, but considering the designer that made him also made pre-rework Rengar and no longer works for riot, it's no wonder his kit is flawed in more ways than one.\n\nThe only real way I can see them justifying increasing his base stats without breaking him and making him even more oppressive early in certain matchups would be reducing how strong his heal is vs Minions and increasing its strength vs Champions, and even then he would still be cheesy as fuck early by design. No amount of number changes would change that about his current kit.\n\nHe needs a rework that at bare minimum replaces his passive and ultimate. They need to decide what he is supposed to do and what he isn't supposed to do. He doesn't do anything they intended him to do. They intended a late game character, he sucks late. They intended a light fighter, he builds primarily tanky. They intended a duelist, he either bursts people done quickly with cheese or gets fucked. \n\nAuras are bad design, especially a team-wide one. You would have to remove all of the damage parts of his R, and the AS/Range portion, to make it balanced.","replies":[{"poster":"Dreamspitter","date":"2015-12-09T08:16:21.566+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Kingsgrave,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=5GXwf7dN,comment-id=001d00000000000000000000,timestamp=2015-12-09T07:23:22.564+0000)\n>\n> Yeah I got a fact wrong, its been awhile since he was released but honestly he still feels pretty rushed and I'm speaking as a main of his.\n> \n> He doesn't scale with Crit in the slightest and was never designed to, and he can't fit it onto his builds without being useless in fights (moreso than he already is normally)\n> \n> His kit conceptually seems to be about being a late game teamfighter, but he has no real ability to teamfight without getting bursted and he only really wins games by cheesing people early with his R base damage. \n> \n> {{champion:92}} {{champion:24}} {{champion:39}} {{champion:114}} {{champion:80}} {{champion:62}}  existed way before Aatrox did, they are all light fighters\n> \n> You can't buff anything on him because it will just make him broken again.

Wu NEEDS armor because otherwise he wont survive to go in and ult. I just consider Panth an assassin. Irelia...poster child \"statcheck\" as you say.  I think if Riot wants to continue using the term, they need to lock down what it means. But {{champion:266}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:114}} are the only ones Riot has called that. I think it gets weirdly mixed with the melee carry idea.\n\nYou say you want his kit to match his thematics. Ok. What the hell would you put in it? From his lore, inspiring warriors is one key signature thing, and it's not there in his kit currently.  What do you want to replace his ultimate? Do you feel it's not unique enough, or interesting enough being a straight steroid?\n\nI can see you love Aatrox\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/SlmYuwO.jpg\n\nI also do -I've played him since release, though recently I've moved a bit from playing tops to mids. He used to be my top champ, before I picked up Zed in September.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/fI4uSvS.jpg\n\n#I WANT developments for him\n\nBut it's probably **not gonna happen**. Not for at least 2 or 3 seasons I figure. \"Immobile Mages\" are the next project being looked at, and I presume eventually they will get back to fighters.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Rebonack","date":"2015-12-09T01:57:17.177+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Kingsgrave,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=5GXwf7dN,comment-id=001d0000,timestamp=2015-12-08T20:34:19.139+0000)\n>\n> Aatrox's design was just rushed, once he gets a rework he will finally match his aesthetic and story better.\n\nI don't disagree with you.
