Using abilities to dodge spells? Not many people have those, and even fewer that don't require targets like Twisted Advance or Sweeping Blade. {{item:3222}} must be purchased by another play, and even then, isn't suitable for all champs. {{item:3140}}  is completely useless on mages.\n\nWhen people say he has no counterplay, they mean his extremely powerful, targeted nukes.

He can stun people in a huge AoE for 2 1/2 seconds, walk up, erase them with his Q + extremely broken ult.\n\nSeriously, 120% of his own AP AND 80% of an opponent's. This is a joke, and it allows him to get slaughtered in lane but still win fights *because* he lost lane, and his enemy got AP. Consider against {{champion:34}}. Also slow (slower, actually), much more mana hungry, also has very potent AP ratios (two 100%s), and a spell to restrict enemy movement. The difference? You can walk around Crystallize until late game when it becomes huge, even if it blocks your path, it never stuns or even slows you, you can dash through it (whereas Event Horizon stops and stuns people who try that). Her strong AP ratios aren't supplemented by her opponent's, like Veigar's.

Veigar on the enemy team? Guess the support should build a {{item:3222}} or maybe the AP champs need to pick up a {{item:3140}} or a {{item:3102}}.\n\nThis isn't aimed at anyone personally, but I'm tired of people QQing because they can only counter a champ at the cost of their beloved full build, braindead, exact same, 6 damage items only. Building defensive items to adjust to your opponent's team comp is the definition of \"counterplay.\" The fact that people think champions can't ever build more than one way is cancerous and needs to be beaten out of them.\n\nOh and by the way, if you're playing in ranked or normal draft, for one nobody's ever gonna pick Veigar, but on the off chance they do, and he's not last picked, Morgana completely counters him just by existing, and she also happens to be amazing as a support, so she, unlike Veigar, is a versatile and good pick your team won't hate you for.\n\nSecondly I have to address this quote \"The problem is that Event Horizon isn't tied to Dark Matter. He can stun people in a huge AoE for 2 1/2 seconds, walk up, erase them with his Q + extremely broken ult.\"\n\nThis is not a problem, this is Veigar's identity. I'm dead serious. **THIS. IS. VEIGAR'S. IDENTITY.** This is literally how and why any and all Veigar players play him. Being able to completely destroy someone cause he stunned them is what he does. Being able to *always* be a threat to the enemy AP champs even if he's way behind or being played as a support is a key component to his appeal. When Riot changes this (which they will) Veigar will be forever alone tier with Urgot, and it will just be more proof that the current balance team doesn't know shit about why people play certain champions. If they reduce or remove his stun, or his ult they'd be better off just taking him behind the shed and putting him out of his misery cause nobody will play him again.\n\nPS. I'm already calling bullshit on the incoming reasons for incoming Veigar nerfs that Riot will inevitably say about Veigar \"lacking meaningful tradeoffs.\" Veigar's meaningful tradeoffs right now are that he's so squishy, immobile, and short range that in order to matter at all he has to meaningfully get in range to land his combo before **HE** gets deleted, it's harder than it sounds, and any smart team will know this and prioritize killing him first, trust me, as someone who plays Veigar, he's not hard to kill. Having to be in a very specific and good position to be able to succeed is a very meaningful tradeoff, in fact it's so meaningful, it's probably the only reason Veigar isn't played constantly and isn't truly OP. Being so hyper-mobile that you don't ever have to worry about positioning like tons of champions in this game are (including most of the newer ones) however is the least meaningful tradeoff of all, and it's insane to me that the balance team doesn't realize this.

Veigar doesn't have any counterplay problems, in fact there's a lot of counterplay to him. \n\n1) Magic Resist. Seems obvious, I know, but you'd be surprised how often people either pick up a miniscule amount or none at all vs Veigar, those people tend to cry the most too. MR really screws with Veigar because of reason #2.\n\n2) He can either kill you with a combo, or he has almost no hope of killing you at all. If you're still alive after Veigar QWR's you, congrats, Veigar is a free kill for you at least until he gets another AP item or farms for days.\n\n3) Stun down? Massive cooldown? Yeah. Veigar's a free kill.\n\n4) BUY TENACITY, BANSHEE'S, OR QSS There isn't a single stat that screws over a champion as much as Tenacity or QSS screws over Veigar. It makes him almost useless.\n\n5) Don't be stupid. If Veigar is on the enemy team and is doing well, don't ignore what I've said above. Everyone who whines about Veigar never buys Tenacity or Banshee's against him.\n\nCHAMPIONS THAT RENDER HIM (largely) USELESS: I don't mean lane counters, I mean champions with skills or abilities that seriously mess with his gameplay.\n\n1) Morgana: Her shield will let enemies pass right through your stun, as well as soak up your damage.\n2) Garen: This guy does not die. This is the classic Veigar dilemma of \"if you can't combo it, you can't kill it\".\n3) Anyone with a gapcloser. Veigar is a non-mobile mage, this should be self explanatory.\n4) Anyone with temporary invulnerability (including Zhonya's). Nice stun, mind if I walk through it as if it were nothing? Oh was that your ult, sorry it missed me.\n5) Anybody who's smart enough to not let Veigar farm in the beginning will render his whole game obsolete.\n\n----\n\nIn short, Veigar has more counterplay than a lot of other champions and weakening him further would throw him into trash-tier. He's an immobile mage to boot. \n\nIf these changes do go through, I really hope he gains some extra mobility like Ahri did or lower cooldowns / Mana costs otherwise he's going to drop even further out of the meta.","replies":[{"poster":"DemiluniS","date":"2015-02-06T15:15:30.050+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":5,"body":"> 1) Magic Resist.
