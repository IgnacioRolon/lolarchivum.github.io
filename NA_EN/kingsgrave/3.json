His W and E take no skill and are just use and forget. His kit is somewhat clunky because of cast animations but removing those would make him obscene at higher level play if you played him perfectly. His Q is just crazy safe farming and RNG burst and his R is only ever used to get a free assist while in Top Lane. \n\nFor a Ship Captain and Pirate Marauder he really doesn't do anything flashy or cool or exciting. I really wish we had Kunkka over him. http://dota2.gamepedia.com/Kunkka","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2015-03-26T18:44:36.068+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":0,"body":"Still planned and the gameplay changes are showing promise.

Otherwise, Gangplank just has the wall-dashing ability+AS himself\n\n>Something to do with spooky voodoo pirate magic\n\n>Parrrrrley becomes a narrow single-shot revolver skillshot, but it can bounce off walls and *hit turrets for 25% of its normal damage*, so that you can hit people around corners or finish off a turret while going in for the kill\n\n>Gold gain becomes more emphasised as Gangplank loves his booty, and Grog-Soaked Blade becomes more powerful, but only applies the poison after a lengthy trade","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hideki","date":"2015-03-26T21:07:43.993+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=qbmRVoP7,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2015-03-26T18:44:36.068+0000)\n>\n> Still planned and the gameplay changes are showing promise.
