He was supposed to be a Light Fighter. 2-3 Damage items instead of 1. Making W true Damage seems like a good idea tho.\n\nE slow being 3 seconds at rank 1 might be a bit much, but even then I don't think it would be that excessive. I changed his E to 3 seconds right on top of him and 1.25 seconds at max distance so it incentivizes him to get closer with his Q and use it less for poke and more for the slow.","replies":[{"poster":"Quality Content","date":"2015-06-12T01:32:28.559+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=CynicalGiant,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=9rAwX47H,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2015-06-12T01:29:04.304+0000)\n>\n> Aatrox needs more incentives to build Damage, he was never intended to be a Tank or Tanky Bruiser.

Even if you give him higher scalings he will still be built mostly tank because he doesn't have the tools like Yi and Yasuo do to evade damage.
