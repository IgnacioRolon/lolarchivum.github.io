The risk to lifesteal is that if you get locked down, usually as a squishy because those are the ones that usually buy Lifesteal, you cant lifesteal and you die. There is a sustained risk and reward pattern there. \n\nIf you just have a viable version of Zeke's where it does as you suggested, then you just have someone like Aatrox who will build full tank beyond that item and sustain. Lock him down and you cant focus Vayne. Lock Vayne down and you can't focus Aatrox or the other AD that might be on the team that is giving him Lifesteal anyway.\n\nAlso with Auras you have to be worried about multiple team members buying it.

I don't really know what the benefit of giving AD and Lifesteal to teammates really is and based on a past decision to remove the Spellvamp aura from WotA, I can't imagine you all will keep the Lifesteal on there much longer. Especially because Lifesteal and Spellvamp are very selfish stats and can also be way too powerful if you gave a lot of it to people. All the items that give those stats are rather costly, usually at a risk, so I can't imagine its good for a utility item to have the stats. \n\nI know it seems rather harsh to change it completely and perhaps I should have explained it more, but as it stands nothing about Zeke's is good item design and none of the stats or ideas behind it really work. Not saying my idea is any better tho.\n\nThe general intent with the passive was to create an item that a tanky utility character like a Nautilus or a Rammus would buy to gain sustain in teamfights that they otherwise wouldn't have, but it comes at a rather high cost for the item.","replies":[]},{"poster":"NullDragon","date":"2015-02-12T12:03:37.006+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot Reinboom,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=a9uWghyd,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-02-11T21:58:55.306+0000)\n>\n> Your passive is pretty complex there and obfuscates what your intents are.\n> \n> The overall idea of tank active sustain is actually a really cool idea.

This aura should be on an item for tanky supports and junglers to buy when they're ahead. A snowbally item to help slay dragons and push towers. A risky item that could backfire, and end up being wasted gold if you're unable to capitalize on it. It's a niche that is noticeably missing from the shop, and one this aura or a similar one could fulfill nicely if attached to a different item. \n\nIt's clear from your post that you view Zeke's in the light of what it has become, a poorly concieved AD fighter item with awesome stats, bogged down by am awkward aura. The reason these don't work together is the stats are designed to help a fighter in lane (top lane) but because of the powerful aura, the gold efficiency of the stats are too low to be able to justify buying in lane. The way to fix this problem is to split these effects into two items. \n\nThe first, a top lane CDR/sustain/aura item for AD fighters which would look something like this:\n\nZeke's Herald:\nKindle Gem + Vampiric Scepter + 800 gold\n300 Health\n25 Attack Damage\n10% Lifesteal\n10% Cooldown Reduction\nUnique Active: All nearby allies gain 20 attack damage and 15% Cooldown Reduction for 10 seconds, 210 second cooldown.\n\nBoom fighters get everything that attracted them in a much sleeker package while still being able to help their team. And tanks can claim the rights to a new persistent, offensive aura. Which brings me to:\n\nStark's Ferver: (working  title)\nglacial Shroud + Dagger + Kindlegem 700 Gold\n200 Health\n250 Mana\n30 Armor\n10% Cooldown Reduction\nPassive: All nearby allies gain 20% Attack Speed and 3% Movement speed. \n\n\nThe reason Zeke's Herald works better as an active is because it allows us to make it slightly more gold efficient, and shift the power around to where an AD fighter in the top lane might consider buying it early enough for it to do its job. Stark's Ferver, with a persistent aura works better on a tank/support champion in the jungle or bottom lane. It allows his team to utilize the aura both in the team fight, and after, for sweet objective control. \n\nPlus I think the idea of a active aoe CDR buff will be pretty cool, I'd have so much fun casting it immediately after my friends ulted!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Duke Anax","date":"2015-02-12T11:40:45.204+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the CDR AD part is the most important, because there is not much alternative.

I really like this item. Too bad it's not good enough to get often. I usually get it if I'm ahead and we just need a little more damage and I know we're going to win anyways even if I don't have a better tanky item. So I only end up getting it rarely. I mainly like it and get it for its passive. That's what I'd say its most important identity is for me. Giving team extra damage and even some lifesteal. Well, mostly the damage part, cause like, I don't know if Vampiric Scepter building into it is suitable for it. Cause you get Vamp Scepter, yet when you get the full item, the aura gives your allies lifesteal and not you.\n\nSo you maybe you could tweak it to give allies extra AD/AP and get rid of the lifesteal part on it. Cause I really don't think that Vamp Scepter should build into it, especially since you don't get any of the lifesteal yourself from Zeke's. I think it's better if you have top Renekton, mid Zed, jungle Warwick. Cause it gives no AP bonus and would be wasted on AP team comps.\n\nMaybe give it something like 30+ AD (to make it better, like a buff, and to make up for the loss of lifesteal), and however much AP. Maybe 30AD/50AP, or....you could have it give something like 10% AD/AP kind of like what you did with Dragon.\n\nThe 20% CDR is nice, but it's wasted on champs who get something like Iceborn, Locket, and Crucible or something. 2 of those is nice, but I think it goes over 40% CDR with Zeke's if you have 2 or more of those. Sometimes I'll get Face of Mountain, Locket, and Crucible. Which is 30%, so the 20% CDR would be wasted if I got Zeke's with those items. Maybe give it 5% or 10% CDR, and give it other better stats in exchange. I'd say it's extra damage aura fits its identity more than all that cooldown does. Oh, I have an idea. You could make it similar to Locket. A bit like this.\n\n500 health\n50 armor\n5% CDR, or 10, I guess\n\nPassive: Flat/Percent bonus AD/AP to allies.\n\nMaybe an active as well. Cause I feel if the extra damage actually helps your team win fights better, then you should get assists off it somehow. Cause I think it can be really good for that.\n\nEdit: PS, if nothing else, at least take the Vamp Scepter out of its build. That is the most awkward thing ever. What if the support chose to get Vamp Scepter first. \"Why does Leona have a Vamp Scepter????\", \"Uhhh.....for the only support item that builds out of it\". So I'd say that most supports get Kindlegem first, then wait till they can upgrade it fully. Cause that's what I do. Would you walk around with a Vamp Scepter until you get 1650G to upgrade it?? As a support of all roles.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Terchio","date":"2015-02-12T05:35:15.755+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It should be a physical support item, really. Always been able to do that since the Stark's Fervor days, but it's definitely lost its edge on its DPS clientelle, as it should. No reason support should be left to a bunch of poofy magicians. I tend to rock this whenever I break out my Supplank, but sadly he's one of few choices that have any synergy among possible supports (Lee sin maybe? Ashe? Urgot?)\n\nI will say, lifesteal is a cruddy stat for a supporty character who is supposed to be a lesser force when it comes to damage, and it's very hard to balance a support item based on stats supports can't use. Additionally, very few champions use CDR and lifesteal particularly well together anyways. I'd suggest a real \"herald\" type approach to the item where you plant a symbol for the opening charge; I'd say something like a mark left following your autoattack on an enemy target to be plunked by your support for damage (think Lux's passive, or more similar to Leona's passive), or a healing effect that has no bearing on the power of either your autoattack or your allies', with a set amount of heal instead. It would feel similar to the old Innervating Locket, but would activate on autoattack (probably balanced to be only for melee, but they tend to be the only ones that use Zeke's anyway).\n\nAnd btw, someone had some old campaign to bring a buff champion to support named Angus. I definitely back that, as something needs to quell these supermages going down there, like Annie and Morgana.

Yes there are other items with better Health and other items that gice CDR, but if you are picking Braum you should be picking him in a team with at least 2 champions that heavily rely on AAs (and unless the 2nd champion is a Kayle or Teemo they are probably AD) both of which will use the lifesteal. On 1 person Zeke's is actually like 105-7% gold efficient, just over 100 but I forget the exact percent, with an ADC and another AA based champion in range that becomes at least 200% (for them two) as well as it's still a decent item on you. No it's not the best item in every case, but if you picked Braum into the right team comp (after the Braum nerfs you should pick him into an AA heavy team) Zeke's can be 300-400% gold efficient giving him good stats for most of the team.\n\nWhen you think of a support item that Braum, Leona, and sometimes Thresh should build that often seems silly it's actually Locket. You build it for the AoE shield but you build it against a heavy AoE team even if they don't have a ton of magic damage and you don't need the MR that much. Same on a lot of squishy supports, why does a Janna need MR against a Talon mid? She doesn't but between Talon's rake and Jinx's rocket's AoE Locket is a decent item.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Fitz n The Fool","date":"2015-02-12T21:09:28.891+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"PLEASE just revert Zeke's back to what it was in season 2 early season 3.
