Beyond that you have the outliers. Unless you mean to tell me only Vi and Sejuani are overpowered, and only Azir, Elise, Syndra, Ryze, Urgot,  Evelynn, Gragas and Zilean are underpowered.\n\nHint: bullshit","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Kingsgrave","date":"2015-02-17T08:23:59.211+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Strat,realm=OCE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=TjMa8t9n,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2015-02-17T07:44:13.297+0000)\n>\n> Kat is already balanced.
