So let me get this straight attrox should be able to \n~succesfully enter a team fight with team against the enemy team\n~without getting instantly focused and passive popped within 2.09 seconds (half the hp half the time if not less)\n~revive before his teammates meet the same fate in even less time\n~And magically be able to sweep up the team that nuked the hell out of him and his team? No\n\nThe answer to all those is just no. Attrox IS NOT A FIGHTER. Attrox is a glorified high sustain tank that has the whole devlopment team thinking he is a fighter because they intended him to be that way. In reality he IS better suited as a tank in practice; NOT IN THEORY. Look at almost every normal match he is in. Most of his items is one major attack item like Hydra then all tank items. Its his only viable tactic because he is instantly focused as a pure fighter because everyone knows a pure fighter attrox cant survive being focused for a second if they all drop a skill on him\n\nAlso a fighter attrox gets crushed by tryn once he starts stacking up crit chance. \nWhy doesnt Attrox get crit chance when his passive is up?\n Like 0.4% crit chance per point of blood whatever passive. \nTryn easily phases through attrox terrible life steal in mid - late game because of crits. Also he can easily pop his passive in 2-3 swings. \nNo amount of attack speed or life steal is going to save a fighter attrox against a tryn shelling out 1.5k crits ON EVERY HIT. Just look at my ranked tryn stats. I am able to hit 1.5k crits and with enough crit chance thats every swing and you are going to feel it when i pop my ult and you dont run away screaming. Specially if you are squishy like a fighter attrox. A simple math problem  say some how some one got 10k hp. 10/1.5=6.667~\nthat is roughly 7 attacks. A tryn with 2.5 (capped atk speed) with 1.5k crits would kill some one with 10k hp in roughly  \n7\\2.5=2.8. So in 3 seconds i could nuke 10k in true damage. Well if they have armor yes that will help but you sare seeing this right?\n\nNo matter what tryn is gonna nuke fighter attrox\n\nLook at my ranked tryn matchs. Tryn out classes attrox on ALL LEVELS. So seriously if attrox has like 2 - 3 k hp If i wanted to i could kill him in 2 hits. Roughly 1 second on max attack speed. Meaning that attrox wont have time to dps me down. So when he revives i'll kill him in .5 seconds or less\n\nAttrox i rarely see in ranked or in normals he isnt viable and was a waste of good IP he needs a rework just as much as other champions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Eeyore","date":"2014-12-30T16:55:19.381+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=alR9fGRR,comment-id=000c,timestamp=2014-12-26T23:06:00.976+0000)\n>\n> I could see an argument for reworking Aatrox into a tank (first into the fight and all), personal feeling though is that a fighter's both what his theme's a better match for (he'll personally cut you down, rather than primarily setting up his team to do so). \n\nUmmm... his lore is literally about him setting up his team to mow people down (both his own and Tryndamere's, and Ezreal's diary). Like... this is the biggest issue I have with Aatrox. His lore literally describes him as a commander who has the power to inspire fearlessness and undying rage into his allies, yet his kit is just a cookie-cutter fighter with no interaction with his allies. If he needs to be a tank to actually deliver his fantasy of a commander who defies the will of the valkyrie - I'm all for it. Heck, I implore you. \n\nHis kit and quotes are some guy who loves killing people; his lore and model (crown-horns and banner-wings) are about a commander. It's like you fused two different champions during his development.

It's strong but the strength is invisible.\n\n-------\n\n**About Shen:**  \n\nI think his visuals indicate an assassin and his gameplay indicates a tank. His kit has support traits  (He basically fits the Braum category in terms of kit). And Lore indicates someone who's supposed to be able to take on Zed. So he's all over the place.\nWhat do tanks do? Not care about your damage and disrupt you with their CC. (he kinda poorly does this)  \nWhat do assassins do? Provide single target threat and tricks to stay alive. (he doesn't do this)  \nWhat do supports do? Heal, shield, buff, debuff, disrupt.  (he kinda poorly does this)  \nWhat do fighters do? Stay on you. Fight you. (he tries to do this)\n\nIf you changed his visuals to make him more heavily armed and armoured he could get away with being a fighter (that's what I think he should be tbh now that his tank role has soaked into the community).

Just please no. His ult can be anything EXCEPT an AoE fear.....like omg. Worst...idea...ever, and so broken with the right team comps. Go ahead. Take some time to think about it.

It's so great! :3\n\n\nThese are my thoughts on Aatrox's identity/theme:\n\nI always thought of him [Aatrox] as an artisan of war and death. You can definitely see it in the way he handles his sword and especially his quotes, like: \"This battle will be my masterpiece\" or \"Rage against the dying of the light\" or \"Violence is elegance.\" To me he comes across as a graceful and yet sadistic warrior.\n\nHe's not the kind of entity that would think: \"I will empower my allies.\" Quite the contrary actually; Aatrox just wants people to fight, to bloody and bruise each other, and to lose themselves in hate and rage (\"Some fight for honor, some fight for glory. It matters only that you fight.\"). That's why he could never be a Tank or someone that sets up for his allies. Honestly, from a thematic standpoint I can't imagine that he considers anyone to be his ally or friend (heck, just look at his Champion Info page... he's only get one recognized relationship and that's a rivalry with Tryndamere).  Even his lore makes him seem indifferent to either side of a conflict, since he only desires the conflict itself: \"Though these stories remember him as a savior in dark times, Aatrox's true legacy may be a world filled with conflict and strife.\" \n\nI also consider him to be a graceful swordsman and that sense of grace doesn't really fit with the idea of a tank which tends to be either a large hulking force of nature (think Malphite, Maokai, Bristle[Sejauni], Cho'Gath, etc...), a heavily armored/shielded entity (think Leona, Braum, Nautilus, Blitzcrank, etc...), or a dead/nerve-less entity that can't feel pain and therefore has no problem with eating skillshots and other damaging abilities (think Singed, Sion, Zac). I can only think of a few exceptions like Shen, Vladimir, and Amumu (who really doesn't seem all that beefy).\n\nHowever, a sense of style and grace is only fitting for Aatrox! An immortal blade-wielding demon-guy has had centuries to perfect his craft! His moves are effortless and sharp! When he uses Massacre he practically glides across the field cutting down foes! His fighting style is very smooth as well with different animations depending on whether it's a normal strike or a Blood Thirst/Blood Price strike. To me it's extremely satisfying to watch him attack.","replies":[{"poster":"Dreamspitter","date":"2015-01-01T09:43:50.704+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Quort,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=alR9fGRR,comment-id=000c0000,timestamp=2014-12-26T23:46:46.431+0000)\n>\n\n> \n> He's not the kind of entity that would think: \"I will empower my allies.\" Quite the contrary actually; Aatrox just wants people to fight, to bloody and bruise each other, and to lose themselves in hate and rage (\"Some fight for honor, some fight for glory.
