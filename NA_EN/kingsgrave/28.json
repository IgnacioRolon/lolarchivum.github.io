Riot SHOULD at least explain themselves to their own playerbase about WHY. \n\nYou've said it yourself, it's the inconsistency that makes those that immerse themselves in the event/lore feel robbed of their time, and now also money because Captain Fortune is a skin you need to purchase, You can unlock GP's \"Captain\" skin after the new model comes to play.\n\nthis whole GP died and now he's back is a consequence of MF's actions.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Slyfoxkan","date":"2015-08-03T02:13:51.398+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well \"captain\" gp isnt the base skin for GP anymore.

Patch 5.15 comes out before the event ends so everyone can get the skin for free. In the meantime, all MF players that want their character to reflect the lore or just like that model will have to purchase it. that's textbook unfair, one player base gets something for free while another part of the playerbase need to pay for it.\n\nAnd while MF didn't look like the main focus of the burning tides plot, she's the mastermind behind it. She hired Graves AND Twisted Fate to distract Gangplank so she could make her move and bring him down. She's the one that threw Bilgewater into chaos and now is in a power struggle. She's the reason why GP's model changed IN GAME.","replies":[{"poster":"Slyfoxkan","date":"2015-08-03T20:23:58.181+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Leu07,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=3A1VKvQr,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2015-08-03T13:55:06.696+0000)\n>\n> Do you need to pay to get the \"new\" GP skin though? **nope**. \n> \n> \"Captain Gangplank\" will be a gift for all those that played a matchmade game with GP before the event ends.

The event is called Bilgewater: Burning Tides not Gangplank's Bilgewater.\n\nMF doesn't die, she unleashess her big scheme to destroy GP, causing his demise. If Miss Fortune didn't do that, GP wouldn't have a new skin and a **newer base model**. MF's interaction with the game should be her new base or free skin as Captain Miss Fortune. Even if it's an alter ego.\n\nGraves and TF's VU update? are you serious? Miss Fortune's textures weren't even fixed on the TU batch. She's had her kit toyed around but no changes to her problems. TF got a complete new model not too long ago. Both Graves and TF's skins relate to them being **citizens of Bilgewater**. In the Lore Miss Fortune hired them from outside of Bilgewater to distract Gangplank","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Solideus","date":"2015-08-03T17:06:58.657+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"IMHO, It doesn't feel like her captain's attire is something she'd wear every day.
