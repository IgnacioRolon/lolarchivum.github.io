My main issue with the {{champion:26}} rework is that it kept his passive, which carries little gameplay or appreciable power, and kept Rewind as an active ability when it would easily be turned into a passive, and open up an active slot for something that would enable him to do more things for his allies and enemies. Choosing which basic ability to focus on double-casting (QWQ immediately for the double-bomb, or casting QE then Rewinding for more overall utility) is already a big decision point, so having the ability to cast a basic ability off cooldown every few seconds as a passive would make sense, especially now that Rewind no longer affects Zilean's ult. Even now that decoupling Rewind from Chronoshift's cooldown makes spamming W no longer mandatory, using it is pretty much a no-brainer (When would you *not* want to use all of the abilities you just casted?), and it would be healthier for Zilean to have another source of damage besides his Q, since he's still going to follow his current pattern where his damage ramps up super-hard all the way up to level 9, then just stops progressing.","replies":[{"poster":"Kingsgrave","date":"2015-02-11T09:19:03.219+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Teridax68,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=PwjVPsha,comment-id=000a,timestamp=2015-02-11T03:10:20.000+0000)\n>\n> It still slows for less overall than his current perma-slow, so I think that's actually an improvement.

He also spams his Rewind and constantly slows enemies and speeds up allies and is nearly impossible to win teamfights against because he can just save an important teammate. Thats his nice and thats what they want him to do.\n\nIf they moved his w to his passive it would take away a lot of his power from his E and his R, considering they would probably add a second way to deal damage.

His current passive is one of those effects that are massively powerful, even if it's not too easy to see its power, so removing it and adding a more toned-down version of Rewind (e.g. only getting to double-cast a single basic ability on a static cooldown) would \"swap\" out a lot of power that could then be turned into a strong new W. Lobbing bombs and resurrecting people is definitely part of Zilean's niche, and while he's going to be better at that I still think he's going to have some serious power progression problems. As a mage and a support, he's meant to be all about expressing power over his team and his opponents, yet Rewind is one of the most selfish abilities out there, as it affects only him, and is one of the reasons so far why he's felt lackluster in both roles. It does sort of give him more damage and utility by enabling his other actives, but I think it would be better for him to have a proper mage/support kit and a passive that would allow him to choose which bit of damage/utility to use on cooldown.","replies":[{"poster":"Oleandervine","date":"2015-02-11T19:31:44.003+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So what you're saying is take away some skills that make Zilean unique and turn him into the cut and paste Nami/Lulu/Morgana etc who have very straightforward, very classic mage kits?","replies":[{"poster":"Teridax68","date":"2015-02-11T19:53:12.017+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, quite the opposite.

He has really low base stats, really low stat growth and no natural mitigation or steroids of any kind. Your Q, your only source of damage, will deal almost nothing without AP. It has 80% AP scaling for a reason.\n\nAlso, your R will not be that useful without AP since the amount of health they gain upon revival scales with your AP.
