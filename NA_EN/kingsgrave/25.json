I usually don't have an issue with darius but with garen its such a pain in the ass. Two days ago I went 5/1/0 in lane against garen as Riven and the one death i had wasn't even to garen it was to an enemy jinx rocket across the map as I was getting tower dove by a lee sin and garen >.> Basically I destroyed garen in lane and got all the turrets in top lane. Even though I was insanely fed we couldn't close out the game because my bot and midlanes kept getting caught. Once it was late game we lost because garen was unkillable and pretty much did the same amount of damage as i did with just a black cleaver + all tanky items and boots. That is completely ridiculous. Garen as he is right now is pretty much freelo. I use to play garen a lot last season but I've only played him 5 times (i know this number isn't a lot but his win rate and my success with him both prove that he's slightly overturned)  this season after the rework and I won all of the games. Old garen wasn't an issue because he was really hard to kill but fell off and didn't do too much damage. But now new garen does damage and never dies. I don't want garen and darius to be nerfed into oblivion because I find them extremely fun to play against and play as. I just think morde, garen, and darius need some more slaps to the wrists here and there. Like reduce the max ticks on garen's e and I'm not sure what to do about morde and personally I'm fine with darius I usually win against him even when I get countered but its hard to tell so I'll stay out of that one too.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SouL1ess","date":"2015-09-05T02:57:01.001+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Axe?
