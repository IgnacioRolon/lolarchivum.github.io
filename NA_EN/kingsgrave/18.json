Not to mention that AP Fizz is pigeon-holed into buying Lich Bane just so he can be on the same level as other assassins in terms of damage. \n\nHe's an unreliable assassin with 4 item slots compared to 5 on others. He doesn't have any ranged poke and his laning is plainly bad against anyone building AD. \n\nLowering base damage on W and adding AP ratio will just make Fizz's laning even weaker.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SIayton","date":"2015-03-10T15:09:00.723+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"I don't agree. Personally I feel like Fizz has found his spot in the jungle and I honestly hate laning as and AGAINST him mid lane. He's really fun to play in the jungle and I personally feel like it suits him well, as well as offering something a little different when it comes to jungle choices. Its nice to see something that's not CC tank gank machine like vi / sej / j4, or Lee Sin. \n\nPeople complain about jungle diversity right now so nerfing champs that are finding their niche there is NOT the right way to go.\n\nYou also have to consider counter play. Before he pretty much had none. Just Q and then E you for like 80%. Now those are mainly mobility tools and his primary source of damage is being next to you autoing, so there's a lot more counter play to the champ. IMO he's in a way healthier spot right now.

You can't kill him, you can't escape him, and you can't build against his BS mixed damage autos. It's retarded and takes 0 skill. At least AP Fizz relied on hitting his ult to assassinate and escaping death with E. None of that is necessary with this bruiser Fizz except right-clicking.","replies":[{"poster":"SIayton","date":"2015-03-10T17:53:19.917+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can kite him though. He might catch up every now and then with Q and E but they aren't his main source of damage. He has to stick to you to make it hurt.

If fizz were to do %max hp dmg, then fine. but considering fizz only really gains any benefit from it when the mob is almost dead, I don't think it's as necessary.
