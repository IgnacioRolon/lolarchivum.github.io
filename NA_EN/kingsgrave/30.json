Aatrox doesn't shred your armor, his attack speed gets fucked once his passive gets proced which leaves you pretty vulnerable untill you fill it back up which only grants you the extra attack speed untill the GA like effect is back on. He also NEEDS items to do anything usefull, he NEEDS items to suplement his inherent issues.\n\nYour argument is invalid.","replies":[{"poster":"Rakemen","date":"2015-05-13T18:08:32.618+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:5}} shit sustained damage outside of his steroids, Aatrox's sustained damage is far better without using steroids.
