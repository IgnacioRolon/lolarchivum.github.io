It enables Twin Fang to be used rapidly.\n\nKarthus' Q requires you to mash it, once every second. Karthus' Q grants vision. Karthus' Q has burst damage (good for last-hits). Karthus' Q has a bit more range and probably slightly larger damage radius in absolute terms.\n\n\\* AAs and some abilities are measured edge-to-edge, meaning that you can hit a 6-stack Cho with them stupidly easily, but center-center abilities have the same hitbox no matter the size of the edge of the foe (so it is NOT much easier to hit 6-stack than 0-stack Cho, if at all).","replies":[]}]}
