League gives you items to promote playstyle and gameplay choices and preferences even when buying reactively. DotA just straight up gives you the tools to patch your weaknesses and deal with anything that could become problematic. The only league item that seems DotA like in style and in use is Hourglass. \n\nthe former lacks most if not all strategy to make room for Action and the latter lacks Action in almost all forms to make room for strategy\n\n**Basically, the game is decided by your actions not the actions of your opponent in a game like League. In a game like Dota the game is decided by the actions of your opponent almost always from what I can tell. I just wish there was a game that was a happy medium of these 2 concepts instead of being so dichotomous. **\n\nKnowing how to use something rather than when to use it and what it does\n\nWhen do I use the instant Veigar stun cage and where do I have to be to not be in range of it vs removing the ability to use it instantly forcing the Veigar player to do more to make up for it in terms of gameplay and interaction\n\nCompare someone like Chogath to Reksai. The former has a set combo with little to no variation and either your opponent dodges it and you are useless or they don't and you destroy them. Reksai is a lot more sustained and give or take, reliably unreliable essentially, so the majority of doing well as her is in the players hands. \n\n**Im not claiming league has no strategy or is outright removing all strategy, but they are honing that strategy into more proactive and action focused things like the baron changes making it a drastically different buff than Roshan. Team wide pushing objective rather than a straight up power buff to one character. Same goes for the buffs and scuttle crab as a whole.**\n\nI personally don't know how I feel about this. I dislike one dimensional gameplay like Veigar's stun cage being instant or old Sion's Q, but I also don't really know how to feel about literally everything getting massive mobility. If everyone has it I suppose its fine, if the only alternative is instant CC you have to memorize and can't dodge.

How you did your combo vs When you used your combo. \n\nWhen you take away reliability in buttons you take away a lot of \"strategy\" since its not all important anymore to use things at a specific time or position in a specific place because you won't always get the same result.

Its just easier to champ select in LoL when you have the same lane meta since season 1.  If you just pick some APC to go mid, you are sure to face off against another APC.  Who wins is generally defined by who's more of FOTM champ and who has the right rune set up (of course considering matchmaking did its job and you are of similar skill lvl).  Imagine you draft 4 ADC and a jungler, you will more than likely ge crushed and lose from the jump.\n\nDota is the same way, except there is more freedom and strategy involved in picks.  If you pick 4 carries and a tank you deserve to lose.  You have to pick in with the overall strategy in mind and who your possible lane match ups are.  There are heroes that counter pretty hard, but there are also items to fix it and u can always change lanes at a moments notice.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Learnding","date":"2015-02-25T07:04:26.820+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=CynicalGiant,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=uapcMInl,comment-id=0000000000010000,timestamp=2015-02-23T18:32:15.765+0000)\n>\n> Balance shouldn't be defined by champ select.\n\nWhich has been League's status pro quo since season 2.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Knight SoIaire ","date":"2015-02-24T10:03:36.488+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"especialy when you have such an insane champion pool","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"SLangedEdge","date":"2015-02-23T21:22:56.782+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel we are both in agreement with the severe lack of strategy LoL compared to dota tho this might be a positive for lots of ppl.

It also feels like if you don't dodge something you get totally fucked, which is not very intuitive but it's strategical in the 2004 grand strategy sort of way.\n\nIf u dont dodge blitz hook you pretty much get destroyed but have a way to possibly survive and escape. According to friends of mine that play dota, if you get hit by pudge hook you basically cease to exist. This is exactly why blitz has no real burst and why Veigar had his stun changed.

If you can't kill Veigar before he caged you or gets to the point that it doesn't even matter anymore, it's essentially an auto lose. That style of feast or famine has no place in league and after a few patches I honestly feel like Veigar will be fine.

A lot of Season 5's new items, like {{item:3512}} , {{item:3800}}, the new Elixirs and {{item:1039}}'s upgrades, were designed to promote strategic diversity and new strategies, even if the results are currently mixed. In fact, pretty much all of Season 5's changes to the jungle have added strategic elements to the game (which monster do I {{summoner:11}} ? Is the vision given by the Scuttle Crab worth the time spent killing it? How much will my team benefit if we rush Dragon or Baron, versus the time, resource commitment and risk involved?), so if anything the game's been adding strategy, not removing it.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=CynicalGiant,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=uapcMInl,comment-id=,timestamp=2015-02-23T16:51:30.063+0000)\n>\n>Basically, the game is decided by your actions not the actions of your opponent in a game like League.\n\nI also completely disagree. If anything, I'd say League pays more attention to the actions of your opponents than Dota, at least when it comes to how fights break down. On one hand, poor strategic decisions are more harshly punished in Dota than they are in League, but on the other there's a lot more room for moment-to-moment outplays in League than there is in Dota. Sure, mobility creep is still an issue in League that hasn't yet been fully addressed, but the core idea of placing the reliability of abilities on the skill of both parties (i.e. play and counterplay), rather than just one or the other, is a good one. Dota does have counterplay, but it's frequently detached from moment-to-moment gameplay and, more often than not, relies more on awareness of what's going on and who's doing what in a more general sense, than it is about actually reacting to any single ability (reaction is often not even a factor).\n\nCall me a League fanboy, but in the end, despite the recurring statement that Dota is a more cerebral or skill-based game, I feel League of Legends is actually far subtler in many ways. Play and counterplay in League is a lot more granular, and tends to offer a wider (and more meaningful) range of options than Dota's gameplay, which too often relies on hard counters, unstoppable moves and mechanics more dependent on rote memorization than actual reaction. From the looks of it, Dota's actually moving a bit more towards League's philosophy of clearer kits and less steep abilities (at least judging by the Shifting Snows update, which is its latest major balance patch), but ultimately I feel League has set a framework that allows for both interesting strategic and mechanical play, even if the implementation still has a lot of flaws (that's applicable to Dota 2 as well, though, and to a much larger extent due to it still being in the middle of adding the champions from the original Dota, so just focusing on League's mistakes here is a case of the grass looking greener on the other side).","replies":[]}]}
