Singed is the closest competition (if I may call it that) to Fiddlesticks in terms of being horrible at taking Scuttler, and in my opinion, Fiddlesticks is much harder to take the Scuttler with, and it isn't even close.\n\nWhat Fiddlesticks has to do to take it is either:\n\n1. Drain it to death. He has to stand still to channel Drain, and the Scuttler runs away from him. After the Scuttle Crab leaves Fiddlestick's Drain range, Fiddlesticks has to chase after it, likely halfway across the river. And Fiddlesticks cannot kill the Scuttle Crab in one Drain channel, at least in the early game.\n\n2. Dark Wind/Auto attack  to death. This also is a bad option because Fiddlesticks doesn't build attack damage, and Dark Wind also isn't enough to kill the Scuttle Crab in a couple hits either.\n\nSinged at least can run around with poison active and auto attacking it to kill it at least somewhat effectively, but Fiddlesticks taking the Crab is completely ineffective.","replies":[]},{"poster":"EndlessSorcerer","date":"2015-05-01T03:37:20.841+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Singed has his Fling to lower it's resistances, so he can at least autoattack it to death in a semi-timely manner.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Baron of Bread","date":"2015-05-01T08:28:23.220+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you do it right you can get it so you can run in a circle with it while it walks in your poison cloud.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"JRobin31","date":"2015-05-02T00:58:24.109+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Kamquats,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=YEj1posT,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-05-01T01:33:52.985+0000)\n>\n> Given that Fiddlesticks is literally the worst champion to try and take Scuttler with, he definitely needs this.\n\n{{champion:9}} takes Scuttler Crab almost quicker than _any_ other champion if you fear the crab near the end of his walk and drain him.

Fears/Silences/Stuns/Charms/Roots/Taunts/Entangled are all Hard CC. All of these hard CCs reduce his resistances and technically Fear impairs movement.\n\nSoft CCs are Slows/Blinds since neither remove your ability to move.
