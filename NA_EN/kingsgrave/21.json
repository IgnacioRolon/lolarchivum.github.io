However, those abilities are essentially nidalees ultimate. I wouldnt say that shes ahead of the game. Changing form means changing her abilities so she will essentially only have 3 abilities available at a time until she transforms. Most other champions don't exactly transform like she does so they will have 4 abilities available to them.\n\nThe point was that the cost of the heal is still relatively high meaning that she'd drain her pool particularly faster than other champions if shes constantly heeling herself.","replies":[{"poster":"Kuro Banshee","date":"2015-02-23T07:31:45.149+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Considering we have an Idiot playing Nidalee who waste all her mana on heals, she'll still have half of her spells.

Basing everything off of pros actions will never result in anything good. Pros are pros, and thus can make decisions based off of their preferences. However, with all things considered Lee offers more in the long run than nidalee does. Whereas Nidalee without a doubt beats Lee in poke, she would have to build a lot of AP, reducing her capabilities as a bruiser with teamfight capabilities. If she builds AD or just bruiser, she reduces poke but increases teamfight capability. Lee is someone who, while building bruiser, can instagib a squishy, offer strong CC in teamfights, peel for the adc, AND splitpush. Also just fyi Nidalee COUNTERS J4. He couldn't beat her in a 1v1 at any stage in the game unless he got fed. He can't keep her in the wall with his ult. She can dodge his EQ with her leap. She just beats him in every stage.
