You only get punished for things *you* do, and number of reports dont count against you in any way.\n\nIt takes a long time to be considered reformed by the system, and over an even longer period of time you may drop a punishment/warning tier.\n\nNote that this is not an \"allowed misbehaviors per year\" system, it is a warning that you need to shape up or ship out, and you probably will be permbanned next time regardless.","replies":[{"poster":"G  Ô  D  ý  R","date":"2018-05-11T23:16:23.597+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the information.","replies":[{"poster":"KazaJhodo","date":"2018-05-12T05:06:15.488+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=G  Ô  D  ý  R,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=M8PpsAGj,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2018-05-11T23:16:23.597+0000)\n>\n> Thanks for the information.\n\nThe system is retarded, there is some more information.\n\nWe need reaction to troll play. Troll play has a far more direct impact on the game than chat.\n\nNot bans, but just lp movement in order to balance the ladder. Fuck i'd do lp loss over anything else. Ban account for racial shit or whatever maybe, super extreme troll cases. Otherwise just hit them with hard -lp losses. If you want to troll, fine, and you can keep your account- but play in bronze 5 where you belong. \n\nRiot could also create a lower tier than bronze for the super trolls. Call it hell, and put them in there. Its the size of a full division. Hell 1-5, that would be awesome. If you just hit trolls with a big ol -100lp they'll get shoved down the ladder real fast. The difficult part would be detecting them, but thats not so hard.... well its possible.\n\nCertainly more possible than it is to tell how good someone is from 10 promo games, when you have 9 other random players effecting your play every game. lol.\n\nWe'll hit the mute button for troll chat.

It takes a very large amount of games as well as not receiving reports from those games before you can move down a penalty. If you're negative, toxic, or being inflammatory, your next penalty will be a permaban.\n\nBut honor has NOTHING to do with penalties. You can be honor 5 and still get banned.","replies":[]}]}
