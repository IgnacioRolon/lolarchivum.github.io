Other than leaving lane and telling my team why I left the lane I was barely toxic at all. Does Riot even read the chat of the other players in your game or do they just see you say &quot;stfu&quot; and &quot;reporting&quot; and immediately judge that you&#039;re a toxic player. All throughout the game the Nasus and Wukong on my team harassed me with spam pinging and insults but I get banned. 10/10 logic. I flamed for one game out of the what 6 or so that I played today and without a warning I was perma&#039;d.\n\nDoesn't matter anymore, I uninstalled league. ","replies":[]}
