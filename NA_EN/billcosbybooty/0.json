I used some internet tests and everything said my internet connection &amp; speed was good, but when I play a league game, my ping has no limitations ranging from 40 - 15000 m/s.  I have tried restarting my pc multiple times, I have no other applications running at the same time as league, but no matter what I do my ping constantly spikes back and forth in-game.  I played a custom game and my ping stayed around 50 ms and spiked to 150 a few times so I tried to play a normals game, then my ping flew back to a constant 6000 as seen on the link.  If anyone has any idea of how to fix this please help me, I can't seem to do anything anymore.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-04T00:18:58.713+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your linked LogsOfLag test shows some nasty latency (ping) spikes over the period of time the test ran.

I was using the new alpha client, and while playing my ranked games, the game would suddenly start being unresponsive or disconnect me. My internet is running fine and I have 36 ping with a capped 144 fps. Nothing spikes. I am unable to use skills, I can hardly move and it acts like I'm lagging, but like I said, my ping doesn't spike.\nI switched back to the legacy client and everything was fine until today, Dec 30th around 5:30pm mtn time. The exact same thing kept happening and I was getting booted from my game constantly. When I try to log back in using either the legacy or the alpha client, the client freezes at \"Authenticating\" or \"Logging in\". Something is severely wrong right now.\n\nI uninstalled league and reinstalled it.  Hoping that it may fix the issue, but I'll have to wait and see","replies":[]}]}
