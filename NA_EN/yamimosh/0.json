It is absolutely miserable to have a support brand afk at tower, shit talk the entire team, proceed to roam and run under tower while doing everything in his power to hold 4 other players hostage for 20 minutes. 20 MINUTES!

They are saying you cannot violate the summoner's code in your own behavior towards that individual.  Basically, someone else breaking the rules of the expected behavior towards others does not give you a free pass to do the same to them.\n\nAs long as the option to simply not insult someone else is available, and insulting someone else earns punishment, you will be punished for insulting someone else. For someone who chooses not to engage in toxic banter, your actions have also just made the game twice as bad, is now there are two people trading insults and barbs at each other rather than one person just ranting in to avoid.

So why should the summoner code (meant to prevent toxicity towards league of legends players) apply to someone who has clearly given up their player status.\n\nThat's the thing though, they can't just do that. If they do that and you report them, it will catch up to them and they will be banned from the game.\n\nAs for why the summoner's code still applies, there are a few reasons. I'll share a few that I'm aware of:\n\n1. Sometimes people misjudge other players, maybe _you_ wouldn't, but others would. It's possible to mistakenly think someone is trolling and then choose to flame them because \"they deserve it.\"\nBut what if they don't deserve it? Then someone just said a bunch of awful shit to them and made them feel miserable when they didn't deserve that at all. Because of how easy it is for people to misjudge, and because of how far people are willing to go when they feel so vindictive, Riot creates general rules against acting upon one's own negative judgement of others.\nThe point is that we are not the judges, jury, and executioner for trolls. Riot is.\n\n2. In cases where players are genuinely trolling or raging out, responding to them (however satisfying it may be) will only encourage or escalate their behavior. A rager will only become more angry and will likely just rage harder. And a troll will see that what they did was effective at upsetting you and so your reactions will only make them want to do it more. In an effort to keep you from feeding into their behavior, Riot doesn't want you talking to them.\n\n3. Even if a player completely deserves it, and even if responding didn't encourage them to continue acting that way, there are 3 other people on the team (and 5 more on the enemy team if you use all chat) who have to bear witness to your reaction to the aforementioned troll. You might feel like it's perfectly fair to spew as much vitriol as you can at the person. And maybe you're right to want to do that, it would be righteous after all.\nBut nobody else should have to see that stuff. chances are if you're trying to hurt someone with your words, you're going to be saying some pretty awful stuff that is very offensive and hurtful to some people, maybe even hate speech that would make certain groups of people (such as particular races, religions, or sexual orientations) feel unwelcome in the game environment.\n\nI hope this helps you to understand some of the underlying reasons as to why Riot punishes us for reacting to trolls. Let me know if you have other questions I'm happy to discuss this further.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Imperial Pandaa","date":"2018-06-26T21:22:40.176+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Says:\n>Riot, you are not people's parents.
