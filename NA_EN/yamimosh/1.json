They are sort of trivial now. \n\nHonestly, i think they should focus on champions if that champion is damaged by another champion while under the turret, with a slight delay to allow a chance for escape. Too many tanks just walk under tower and beat you shitless over and over, by the time the turret even targets them, they killed you, and are dancing away with 60% hp left. - at lv6, no less.","replies":[]}]}]}
