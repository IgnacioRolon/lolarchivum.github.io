Well then you are going to get punished. I'm trying to say that outside of people like Shaco and to some extend Udyr/j4, Early invades are incredibly risky. You are on their turf. if they bother to place a ward and spot you, its game over. Invading isn't always the answer and in a balanced state of the game, shouldn't be. Most champions that can steal camps aren't late game monsters and thus, you announce your intentions when you pick those champions. Most players know to vary their jungle clear against a shaco. His signature move is the easy clear Blue/Red and then invasion onto enemy blue/red. Eve may be a good answer to the sated devourer but she struggles heavily in carrying game.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"KnightsKemplar","date":"2015-07-12T16:41:56.660+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"This.

Poacher's knife might be as good with, as it is against Devourer. Particularly if the Devouring champion are already good duelists. If a Devouring champion uses poaching smite and invades your Jungle, It would only Accelerate his stacking.\n\nInvading the enemy Jungle usually requires one of 3 things. a) You have vision of the enemy Jungle and can safely invade. b) you have enough dueling power to defeat the enemy Jungler before he kills you, or stalls for help, should you get caught. Or c) have enough objective taking tools and escape tools to evade the enemy Jungler. \n\nI don't actually Like Poacher's knife because it means you only want to be counter Jungling.

The point of the item is to kill your opponent by attrition, not by out-scaling and out-farming, but by starving them to death. If it takes a Devourer stacker 30 minutes to get to 30 stacks and they don't have enough gold for other on-hit items, they won't be able to come back hard enough to succeed.

Maintained, with a normal gank pattern, this is 14 stacks in a normal pattern.  That's 4 ganks, half stacked.  Repeat, 25 minutes, Fully Stacked, 8 ganks.  8 Ganks in 25 minutes is more than an effective jungler.  Now then...\n\nTake... say... Teemo:\nTeemo - AS/AP, Set as Jungler (easier than it sounds).\n\nUnlike Yi, this is a pure On Attack champion, who not only raises in damage as he levels/gears with his On attack, starting at level 3 he can out run anyone without a hard escape... his ganks are effective.  On top of this, he can duel your jungler at will and either kill them or push them out of their jungle.  This either slows one or two lanes, forcing them to come to your jungler's aid, or you lose your jungler and Teemo takes part of their jungle... granting him more stacks.  As Teemo's On Attack poison is already something that can blatantly kill, doubling it's potency, while giving him his needed AS and farm, is merely retardation.  Considering his damage, mobility, and his natural ability to hurt you every time he hits you, this is an extremely painful combination with a champion that has a rather easy time in the jungle (assuming you know how to do it).  \n\nThat's... Teemo.
