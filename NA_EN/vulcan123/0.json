Ive tried deleting the lock file but it won't do it, and doesnt stay up long enough for me to try to delete it other times. Can anyone help? i've put too much time and money into this game for it not to work lol\nOh i should probably say the hextech repair tool isnt working either","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-12-08T19:17:49.438+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, what version of your OS are you currently using?

There might be another issue happening in this case, where a network instbaility or block is preventing access to the patching service.

But after I exit the game and try to come back and play later . I click the icon and it bounces for a second and then does nothing. Hextech repair tool does nothing for me either. I'm sure the game would work fine again if I reinstalled, but I've tried that and it lets me in sometimes and then the problem repeats. It feels like something about the new update has files that get corrupted upon exiting the game and trying to open it up again later, or at least for me.","replies":[{"poster":"Vulcan123","date":"2017-12-09T14:08:24.585+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah i think its got something with the new update, i tried reinstalling it twice and nothing. Mine only started doing it when the new update came out a couple days ago","replies":[]}]}]}
