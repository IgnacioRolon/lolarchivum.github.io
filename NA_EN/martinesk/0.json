When I open it, it keep saying unspecific error please check the log. What the heck happens here. It's been two days. And how can I UPLOAD A PHOTO? \r\nI tried every methods in that guide. The problem is still there. I even repaired my external hard drive thinking maybe some bad sector there but none of the solutions work. And wired thing is I can't even delete the file. It says error 0x80070091. \r\nAnd I tried what microsoft says to repair it. But THAT IS NOT WORKING. Maybe SOMEONE at riot can tell me how to upload a photo or zip file? I can send you the logs and you guys can see what happens. This experience really sucks. I called my engineer friend yesterday tried to fix it but he can't do anything about it...","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-08T16:16:31.133+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd like to help with this but need to get some more information.

I mean in that pic I download a latest version game installer from the website why it's still scanning and comparing?
