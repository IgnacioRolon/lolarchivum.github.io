I mean, tanks aren't balanced, but I'd say they're the least \"un-balanced\" lol. Sure, people complain about tanks having too much damage for how hard they are to kill, but I think that people forget that on equal gold footing, a tank should be able to duel a melee carry or ADC. The only difference is that a tank invested in staying alive longer to deal their damage, while a carry invests gold in damage upfront. So while a melee carry will kill a tank more easily than another tank, the tank should still be able to kill the melee carry through base damages and surviving damage to do so.\n\nTanks get a lot of shit, but so do assassins, mages, divers, and ADCs at any point in time. Assassins are way more oppressive when strong because of lack of counterplay when being oneshotted, ADCs are awful when strong because of their ability to 1v5, divers suck when strong because of their ability to oneshot carries AND tank damage, and mages are pretty bad when strong  because they can poke safely from range for free. All tanks do are sit in your face, and maybe take out one of your allies before they have to sit on CDs for awhile.","replies":[{"poster":"Penns","date":"2017-01-20T19:12:33.097+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":36,"body":"So assassins lack counterplay, but tanks, that get basically unkillable if fed, still killing carries in 1 rotation has counterplay? o","replies":[{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2017-01-20T19:13:58.654+0000","up_votes":36,"down_votes":1,"body":"That Nautilus took more than just one rotation and the Draven was behind.","replies":[{"poster":"Penns","date":"2017-01-20T19:18:43.263+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":28,"body":"Its not just about that clip tho and Naut has relatively \"low\" damage because he is overloaded with easy to hit cc.. at least thats how it should be. \nId still argue a squishy assassin with skillshots that, btw, also has to \"sit on CDs for a while\", has more counterplay than a fed 4k hp 250 armor tank.","replies":[{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2017-01-20T19:24:00.556+0000","up_votes":38,"down_votes":3,"body":"Depends on the situation really.

The whole class mess is a big pile of confusion because there are all types of listings.\n\nLoL at it's most basic core divides champions into Assassin, Fighter, Mage, Support, Tank, and Marksman.\n\nFrom there we divide into all the millions of sub categories they use nowadays.  Fundamentally though champions are given a primary and secondary role from that list.  A lot of places are starting to add in other roles like enchanter, juggernaut, warden etc.  At their core they are all based around the 6 basic classes.\n\nExample being that all juggernauts are tanks with a mix of fighter.  In fact I don't think there was a juggernaut pre-juggernaut term days that wasn't a fighter/tank or tank/fighter.\n\nSince as far as I am aware we haven't gotten a complete list of all the champions by their subclasses I prefer to use their classes, since subclasses are ultimately based off their class.\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\nAs such Singed, Cho, Illaoi, Yorick, Kled, and J4 are either primary or secondary tanks.\n\nFor the new updates we don't actually have a good source on.

By the wiki is he a Controller fighter, by the article he is an Enchanter/Warden.  So there is a lot of stuff pointing all over the place.\n\nWhen you trace the sub-classes back to their roots, which you can only apply to Taric if you apply it to how I group all champions, Taric is a Support/Tank with a mix in of Fighter.\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nSince we don't have a comprehensive official list I use champion classes, not sub-classes, because sub-classes are just that, a break off of a class that still falls under that class.  As such all the champions I listed are either secondary or primary Tanks with the possible exception of Cho and Singed due to them being part of the \"Special\" subclass.  Since they used to be tanks pre-name shenanigans I still consider them either primary or secondary tanks when it comes to discussions related to class, because if we only group by sub-class and not class then there are 0 \"Tanks\" in LoL because they all fall into sub-categories.","replies":[{"poster":"SteelMankind","date":"2017-01-21T07:10:14.040+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Would agree with you that the class listings are all over the place, but the list I posted IS considered the Riot-official one. Admittedly, they haven't done a very good job of encouraging or supporting it, something which they may be looking into soon according to Riot Axes. \n\nThe list I posted also happens to be a complete (as of Taliyah) list of every champion by their subclass, so there's that. \n\nEssentially what's going on is this: over the years, the community has scrapped together a loosely-defined class system. It works in general, but the lack of an offical, Riot-supported system causes some misrepresentation on occasion (such as Yasuo being colloquially called an assassin because mobile melee damage dealer, or saying Kayle is a mage because she builds AP). Bruiser in particular is a horrible term because it just means \"tanky with damage\" so people were applying it to any champion who built damage and survivability. Once that happens, it loses meaning, since class distinction is supposed to be around playstyle, not builds. Only recently has RIot actually created an official list, but they've done a terrible job at encouraging it. I guess that's from a lack of communication between the dev team and the client team, but hopefully they will do something to fix it soon. \n\nUntil then, you can either continue to use the old, vaguely defined terminology, or you could be like me and help spread the use of the newer, objectively-better terminology.
