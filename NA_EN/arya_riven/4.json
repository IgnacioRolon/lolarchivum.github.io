You start playing and win some games. You get up to maybe their gold division. Now, you run into some complications competing. People in gold are utilizing their complex pieces like Knights and Bishops way better than you, while are more use to linear tactics like your Rook(Castles) and Pawn Cheese. On top of that, the chess from gold and up has timed moves.\r\n\r\nWould it be fair, for you to demand that Knights and Bishops be removed, replaced with linear Rooks(Castles), and the timers to be removed? Just because you cannot think on your feet, make moves quickly and utilize complex pieces. Doesn&#039;t mean Master tier chess players should remove Knights and Bishops and stop castling, remove the timers and have a slow and linear game. Rather, you should have to learn to play chess better, faster and with more skill in order to compete with them.\r\n\r\nThis is a thoughtline I never understood. &quot;We should balance the game for the majority.&quot; If you balance for a majority of people, who are low skill level, you set the bar low. If you start removing all of the complex mechanics from the game and fast moving twitchy champions, and replacing their kits with slow linear ones. You are shitting on top tier play, for the sake of what? Making sure low tier plays get a participation trophy?\r\n\r\nIf the game was balanced around the most middle ground in League, Silver, that means any player above silver has an imbalanced game, and in order to have a balanced game they have to play the game worse. If you balance and design the game around Challenger/Master tier play however, that means when the game is played at it&#039;s most optimum, it is balanced. And low tier players will eventually adapt and to the best of their ability try to mimic them, achieving &#039;balance&#039; by getting better at the game.\r\n\r\nCurrently, League tries to balance for everyone, the problem with this is, it means it is balanced for nobody.\r\n\r\nYi is OP until gold then worthless above. Riven is worthless below gold then OP in Diamond-Challenger. This is no way to balance a game or a sport.\r\n\r\nSo before you condemn complex pieces, advanced strategies and timers. Think to yourself. &quot;Maybe I just need to get better at chess. Instead of trying to tear master chess players down to the level of my Rook and Pawn cheese.&quot; Because the moment Riot balances the game AND designs for top tier play? Every champion becomes a viable pick when played to an optimum level.","replies":[{"poster":"Genocide Victim","date":"2017-01-30T06:00:46.637+0000","up_votes":40,"down_votes":1,"body":"The Queen is fuckin broken, needs nerf.","replies":[{"poster":"JavelinJoe","date":"2017-01-30T06:20:21.853+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Requiemsfire","date":"2017-01-30T07:06:53.098+0000","up_votes":24,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think the chess analogy really fits, in chess both sides are set up as equal with pieces that can only move a finite number of turns thus the game is inherently balanced between players simply because they have the same options as one another. In League each player gets to pick a single champion in a pool of 134 possible champions which may only by 1 team per game by 1 player leaving a countless combinations in each game so even if you picked your champion well it's practically impossible to have both teams on an absolutely even ground. Also all pieces are complex to use, simply knowing how to castle or move a knight is merely part of the rules. Hell any 6 year old can be taught the rules of chess.  There's also lesser known rules like the En passant that the non chess players probably wouldn't know because it is extremely situational. If you removed the queen or knight from chess then you're not really balancing the game for even lower play at all, you're just removing aspects of it which is why I don't think this analogy makes sense. \n\nPersonally, I'm not a fan of how this thread acts like the mastery of chess revolves around particular pieces referring to skill caps as the very basic moves of chess. Besides I reckon you'd only tell the good from the bad chess players by how they use their pawns at the start of each game.  Novice chess players tend to focus too much on their queen.

A newer or less strategic player might not utilize their Knights and might opt for a more linear style of play, but that doesnt mean that they are at an inherent disadvantage. Their disadvantage is their skill, knowledge, and quick analysis. \n\nSure you can take away Knights or Bishops in the game to balance for linear thinkers, but by the mirrored style of game, its the same advantage or disadvantage to both players. At the end of the day, its the more skilled player in the game who wins. \n\nHowever, League's balance is inherently thrown off by the Champions. There is no perfectly equal matchup. And here lies the problem - a Challenger player might have trouble winning consistently with Yi, even if they are just as mechanically proficient as another Challenger player who plays Riven, because (as an example) A) people react faster to Yi at that level and B) they know how to animation cancel on Riven to push her to her potential limit. However, the same doesnt go in Bronze - a Bronze Yi player might have more success than a Bronze Riven, because A) people miss or mistime their CC more in Bronze and B) Bronze Rivens dont animation cancel as proficiently. \n\nWhen you say things like, \"They should balance around Challenger,\" does that mean they should buff Yi so he is better in Challenger but completely steamrolls the game in every tier below that?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"nm1010","date":"2017-01-30T05:13:06.825+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":2,"body":"Are you by chance a speaker of some sort?

League of Legends is already balanced around high ELO. As far as I know, the game is balanced around Plat+ ranked games, which means data is taken from the top 7-10% of players in League. I would argue that the game could be balanced around Gold+ and still be fine, because the top 20-30% still consists of really good players (especially considering how much play time and experience the average ranked player has).\n\nWhat you don't understand is just how absolutely tiny the Masters/Challengers player base is relative to how much data you need to balance the game. How can you expect Riot to gather **a statistically significant amount of data** (100+ games per champion) on **134 champions** (of which the lowest play rate is 0.5% in Plat+) when there are only **900 accounts** (accounts, not players) in Master/Challenger **in a matter of days** so that they can start making changes for the next patch?

The actual question is, should pawn cheese be something that can be done to success in high Elo, given that it is then supported by knights and bishops? \n\nIf your answer is, \"pawn cheese should not be viable in high elo\" than the high elo game becomes  \"castle into knights and bishops.\" Essentially the game becomes more poor for high Elo because the range of viable options is smaller. \n\nWhereas a better situation is that pawn cheese is viable in high elo, given that it is supported (in high elo) or that it supports knights/bishop play. This gives the high elo player more depth in the game because he can open castle into knight/bishop, or pawn cheese into knight/bishop, or knight/bishop into pawn cheese or any of the other options. \n\nIn your example, high elo is playing pure knight/bishop, whereas low elo is playing pure pawn cheese. The transition from low to high elo is simple to learn: understand knight/bishop, learn to answer pawn cheese, advance. \n\nwhereas the better situation is for low elo players to play simple pawn cheese AND crappy knight/bishop, and high elo players to play transitional/supported pawn cheese AND advanced knight/bishop. This gives both types of players a richer game. \n\n2\n\n\n> Yi is OP until gold then worthless above. Riven is worthless below gold then OP in Diamond-Challenger.

Otherwise if riven is balanced for silver than diamond becomes riven VS yasuo 24/7. \n\nor we can try to make riven balanced for all elos. which is super difficult, but it think the correct goal\n\n3\n\nyou are bringing fast moving, twitchy champions as your example of high skill. how about macro play with champions who's strength is rotating around the map? how about situational play with champions specifically good in specific locations on the map? \n\nIf you are allowing \"fast moving twitchy gameplay\" to trump other strategies than you are not improving the game for high elo - you are removing options and making the game poorer. \n\nAs consequence, you are making being a high elo player simpler: learn riven and climb.
