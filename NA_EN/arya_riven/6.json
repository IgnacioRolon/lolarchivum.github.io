A tank meta is not tanks being viable, that is a healthy meta. Just as an ADC meta is not ADCs being viable, that is a healthy meta. This applies to every class in the game.\n\nA tank meta, or any class meta. Means those champions have so much agency over games that they are not only present in every match but are the dominant picks in every match.\n\nFor example. The ADC meta we would have Graves jungle, Draven ADC, Ezreal mid and Vayne top. That is UNHEALTHY.\n\nBut the exact same goes for a tank meta. When every game would be like. Mundo top, Sejauni jungle, Nautilus support. Stacked to the max to where they made everything but tank busters unviable or nearly unviable.\n\nA healthy meta is one where the most number of classes are effective. Without being too strong. This should be the aim of balance. Not to make any class dominant.\n\nThat said. I am indifferent and unafraid in regards to a &quot;tank meta&quot;. As it just means I can get freelo picking Gnar, Fiora, Vayne or whatever. Plus I doubt a true tri-tank meta will ever actually happen again. Riot has quite intentionally made Pen, Shred, Max HP, True Damage and Current HP all easy to access. In addition they made offense clearly outscale defense.\n\nThe only way a tank meta would succeed these days would be if they all had overloaded base damage like Poppy. And then it would just be taking the place of the toxic diver/fighter meta we are in.\n\nThat said. Damage needs to go down. See my post on &quot;League, then vs now&quot;. But a highly unlikely tank meta is not the savior you are looking for.\n\nThank you for reading. I hope this provided some clarity on what a tank meta is and why it is unlikely.","replies":[{"poster":"serenity7","date":"2017-02-03T00:12:11.459+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":1,"body":"Exactly this.

When Riot updated ADCs they remained right click low utility farm bots.\n\nMages and assassins deal damage. So do divers. All of these classes have more utility and CC than ADCs.
