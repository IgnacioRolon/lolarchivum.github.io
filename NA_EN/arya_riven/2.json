Meaning enemies cannot outplay them and they cannot outplay enemies. This means their entire power budget has to be loaded so if condition x is met they win. Otherwise they lose. Very few people want to play champions like that. So even if they received some slight buffs they would still be less common unless Riot busted them to freelo. It isn&#039;t worth investing yourself into 2 million mastery points on Garen because you won&#039;t gain much by doing so. Other than experience and practice at League in general.\n\nBack to Darius. Darius in the rework was given tools to outplay his opponents. But they can also dodge his Q and Pull. Plus they can see his stacks and play around their mechanic. Thus Darius has a more healthy power budget. Darius is worth investing 2 million mastery points into. Because you have room for growth. But also his healthy power budget makes him viable in all/most tiers of play. \n\n{{champion:122}} and {{champion:420}} are far healthier. Even if frustrating to face they have mechanics you can play around.\n\n{{champion:102}} mini rework helped her health but she still needs work\n{{champion:72}} is thankfully being reworked again to fix him\n\nI honestly cannot figure out why some people defend linear designs but then complain about Ryze root being point-and-click and not having options to outplay less linear enemies. Just let your champion be reworked***** like Darius and have something fun, viable and usable in all tiers. Who has options and non-linear counterplay.\n\n\n\n***special exemption for Morde, Malz and Skarner mains.
