I seriously made it out in shorts and crocs (I'm not proud of that). The computer in the picture is a loaner from a League of Legends community organization in Oklahoma called United As [ONE]. The head of that group is actually the guy that reached to to Riot unbeknownst to me.","replies":[{"poster":"Gavran","date":"2014-08-30T00:33:45.676+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Downvotes from people who didn't believe I was being genuine. :\\ \n\nMeanwhile here I am thinking that this is even cooler - the community *and* Riot reaching out for you.
