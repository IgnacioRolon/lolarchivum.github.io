Summoner's Rift there are more towers to take, Dragons/Barons to secure, a bigger map in general.

Also, ARAM is heavily inclined towards better comps BUT after that, the deciding factor is whoever pokes the other team better, hence why you can win 4v5s, because you can either, have a better comp despite being outnumbered OR just by out playing them. In SR it's a lot harder because there's more to do around the map, and 4v5 is almost impossible to win. In SR you have to keep sight of where the minions are pushing, drake, baron, buffs. 3 lanes, 2 main objectives.. lots of bushes etc. So being short on one is a lot worst in SR than it is in ARAM","replies":[{"poster":"Djeesus","date":"2019-07-16T17:28:35.980+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But there is no point in comparing to SR because the subject is REMAKES IN ARAM, are we talking about Twisted Treeline ? No, cause that's not the point. And moreover, if you really still wanna compare to SR, in SR you CHOOSE your champ, not in ARAM, u get stupid randoms that most of the time do not help the comp for teamfights at all. Rerolls should be 1 per games, that makes 5 possible rerolls if teamates help in which can \"possibly\" help getting some CC when u get a shity comp. It is just to unpredictable, and only pros can pull of some stunts with a useless comp with an Ivern,/Sona/Yuumi/Soraka/Lulu cause ur rerolls we all burned. You could argue there's plenty to do with that comp but NO, anything else on the other side will crush that comp, let alone their experience with the champs they didn't not choose. After one single ARAM game, you can easily burn your 2 rerolls to try to get a decent team comp and then your fked for the rest of the day. Worst, you burn your 2 rerolls to get a decent comp then you might've quite possibly burned your 2 rerolls for a guy that will afk/dc the game anywayss So this ARAM mode lacks serious 'BALANCE'.
