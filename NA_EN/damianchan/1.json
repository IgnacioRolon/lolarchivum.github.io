When you say crash, are there any specific error messages like a bug splat?  If it's just a disconnection notice, then your network could have issues specifically reaching different services like the game server.  This is totally possible regardless of how amazing one's internet or connection might be.  You should go over the steps in the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to troubleshoot.\n\nYou can also use the [hextech repair tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367) to auto-configure your firewall settings in case that's the culprit.  Let me know if you have any questions.","replies":[{"poster":"KankerHoer","date":"2017-05-10T03:52:49.193+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"when will it get fix ?","replies":[]},{"poster":"damianchan","date":"2017-05-10T01:25:08.558+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"its a bugsplat message","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-10T17:00:56.827+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for this info!  Bugsplats usually happen if something like a bad game file or driver fails to render the game.

Apparently I had to set it to be compatible to windows 8 (my computer runs windows 10).  This worked as a temporary solution until now. I was able to play a few days ago without any problems. However today without any major updates happening, the same problem occurred. I tried looking at the compatibility and followed the guide. I also disabled Nvidia's \"Share\" feature and xBox's DVR feature. \n\nHelp would be appreciated!","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
