If they're toxic and bad and you're the one that's going to help the win the game then do it. Prove them wrong. \n\nI recently had my mf cry a river about my sup trundle because she died  when she all in'd at level 1 vs level 2's.  Screamed how bad I was to go ward jg because I saw the enemy jg run that direction and i didn't want my jg to get killed and I pinged that I was doing it. I said sorry, don't stress it. We'll recover, I promise, we got this shit. Took her 5 levels to stop. At that point, I got an e (road block and slow) on their sup and got her a kill, ulted their adc and dived, yi peeled around the corner and took them out, I leave tower half health. I said gj guys, awesome gank. Let's clear their jg and dragon. And we did.\n\nBy the end of the game I was impossible for them to kill me or the mf and she was 10/5. I said encouraging things the whole time and they literally didn't say a thing the entire rest of the game.\n\nSpecifically, people want to vent and blame someone when they make a mistake... What I've found is to let them be frustrated, tell them you'll help them or make it up to them. Then do it.  It's not foolproof. Sometime they're just going to go full retard and feed.  But this has helped me turn things around a lot.","replies":[{"poster":"PrettyPoison 105","date":"2016-01-25T03:20:06.193+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"When I'm not reminding people of the structure of building blocks of living organisms, I try and put in 'nice job' or 'ty' after a leash, even if they continually respond with 'no' and 'u suck' and, my personal favorite, 'u r noob'.

I'm going to get them fed, I'll work hard to help them. TY after a leash that's expected is just lame. nj when you don't get the kill just sounds passive. When you run around the corner, save their ass and secure a kill for them, they realize it might be something they did wrong in the beginning cause all you did was say \"don't stress, keep it up, ur doing fine, I'll help next time\" and you then made good on it.\n\nI've had troll games. I've had the 0/5 teemo sup at 8 minutes tell me I was terrible and let me 1v2 the whole game. He got 2 people on my own team and 2 people on the other team to think I WAS THE REASON HE DIED SO MUCH.... and I said sorry, I'll get you fed and help you recover. I got him a kill. I got myself one. I got him a 2nd and that was all he needed to go 12/11. He ran around the map damn near griefing people, csing and using blind to obliterate a team that was mostly physical.  I HATED this kid. I let it go with one end game screen of \"please report teemo, he's a troll\".","replies":[{"poster":"PrettyPoison 105","date":"2016-01-25T03:47:00.497+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"But saying nice job is for when they get the kill no matter where I am on the map, and I've actually been flamed at for not thanking the ADC for leashing.

It's easy to ignore whats being said in chat (I do it accidentally sometimes because I'm so focused) and its become a second nature to me. In the most extreme cases I wait until the end of the game to Mute/Block them so that if they _do_ say something productive or make good call. \n\nAnd I always remember to report them since a ban/restriction will be the only way they learn. Unless, of course, they continue with their toxic ways and earn themselves a perma ban.
