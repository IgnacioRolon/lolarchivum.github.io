Sadly some people can't laugh at the irony of Ryze falling and the humor that no one in plat+ ranked seems to know how to play his new kit even though there isn't any really crazy mechanics added.\n\nEdit 2: I am still playing Ryze and getting to know his new kit and what works and what still needs work. Currently, my view is his kit is powerful, but a bit at odds with itself at times.\n\nEdit 3: Tank Ryze seems to be dead sadly, with the reduced mana ratios, CDR being wasted on him, and more reliance on AP, I find he needs to take a more traditional burst mage build. His Q also needs some work, maybe have it pass through minions at a reduced damage since it get caught on them too much.\nHis targeted moves seem a little short on the range side and could use a slight range increase.","replies":[{"poster":"Mandang0","date":"2015-05-02T16:03:42.184+0000","up_votes":33,"down_votes":9,"body":"Why are people still surprised when winrates drop after changes?

But then, what after?  Uh...I would say maybe Righteous Glory, for those fast engages + the tankiness, but it also builds out of Catalyst, and stacking 3 mana items might be a bit much, haha...but then again, maybe not?  Maybe it's good...\n\nPerhaps this is a good thing, actually.  Maybe he can build something Like Abyssal Scepter now, since he doesn't need to build any CDR items if you have the right setup.  Another interesting thought is Rylai's.  The slow is a little redundant with his target root, but it'd let you chase decently with your targeted E (the splash), or, for example, slow someone from afar with your Q to get close enough to Prison them.  I only suggest it because it gives AP and HP which both seem good on him now, and I'm trying to think of good non-CDR items for him to build.\n\nActually, as silly as it is, maybe Luden's is good on him now?  It'd probably look pretty cool with the double-splashing effect on his E, at least. :P And don't forget that it gives you some movement speed.\n\nI don't play Ryze, and I haven't tried him at all since the Rework, so my ideas might all be terrible.

His ability to spam may be even more powerful now.\n\nLuden's Echo is a good choice since he can charge it very fast.

You go from having 3 okay damage spells to as-many-as-you-can-cast-in-4/5/6-seconds number of spells, so long as you're comboing correctly. With old Ryze you had a few combos to memorize that you could use in pretty much any situation; because of how new Ryze's passive works, you have to adjust your combos on the fly depending on how many stacks of your passive you have and the timing of your attacks to really maximize his kit. Ryze's skill floor and skill ceiling have increased dramatically, the skillshot is really no big deal compared to his passive management.\n\nEDIT: Additionally, there's the 0.25 second restriction on his passive mechanic; you actually have to slow down your combo in order to utilize the cooldown reduction. It's honestly kind of awkward; I can see why they have it in place (he would be absolutely ridiculous without it), but I feel like there's a better way, like shorten the time you have to actually use the combo but remove the restriction on his cooldowns so he can fully reset them, that way he feels more like the machine-gun Ryze and less like a semi-automatic Ryze.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Beddlam","date":"2015-05-05T13:24:57.847+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also, since Ryze now only gets 3-6 second windows of power, cc is devastating.

I like the rework, but it definitely needs some changes. To my mind the big change is not his Q. This is a change, and it hurts the reliability of his damage, but that was kind of the point. The big changes are his passive and the nerfs to mana scaling. Utilizing that window of power on a champ with zero mobility is tricky against players who know what they are doing. The mana scaling nerfs and 30% CDR on his ulti make his itemization after RoA and Archangel's less clear too.  It will be interesting to see if his win rate goes up after his pick rate goes back down","replies":[]},{"poster":"Venowolf","date":"2015-05-02T21:47:21.744+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"{{item:3285}} {{item:3027}} {{item:3040}} {{item:3020}} {{item:3001}} {{item:3025}} \n\nWith masteries 9 0 21\n\nTry that and you can have a good \"performance\".","replies":[{"poster":"Champion Skin","date":"2015-05-03T01:01:03.915+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Why Iceborn Gauntlet over Zhonyas?\nThe CDR is useless if you go 9/0/21\nSo is the mana/slow better then the AP+Activate of Zhonyas?","replies":[{"poster":"Venowolf","date":"2015-05-03T06:21:48.539+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The passive of IBG is very spammable, and I rush 3rd item, so before lvl 16 is a gold efficient, Zhonyas is a good item too, but at the moment I have very good performance with IBG, to be honest not feel very useful the Zhonyas but maybe I need more games.\n\nIBG = + 40shield with the passive too.","replies":[]},{"poster":"NorthernDruid","date":"2015-05-03T13:14:46.381+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Zhonya's only has 60 AP on IBG. 60 AP vs 500 mana (slightly more mana if you have the mana increase masteries from utility) is roughly twice the offensive scaling on your abilities. but there's that 8% mana shield that you pop two times during an extended fight.\n\nIBG also brings 10 extra armor, and that slow for kiting/sticking.\n\nIBG is 400 gold cheaper.\n\nSo it's a better defensive item (before stasis active), and overall the AoE sheen procc is quite useful.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
