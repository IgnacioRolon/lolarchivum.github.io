It is built out of Vampiric Scepter and BFS, just like Bloodthirster, but outside a few cases, is simply an inferior Bloodthirster. By the time you would get Essence Reaver, most ADC can deal with mana issues, and the life steal is wholly worse than Bloodthirster. A major problem is that Essence Reaver is so similar to Bloodthirster, you will almost always choose Bloodthister over Essence Reaver. The best way in my opinion to stop the comparison, is to remove the Life Steal and change it to a stat that is just as coveted.\n\nWith the current PBE changes to Black Cleaver losing the flat Armor Pen, some people are concerned about what they are going to build out of the Brutalizer besides Ghostblade, if they are not jungling, for AD casters. I suggest changing Essence Reaver by dropping Life Steal from the item completely and replacing it with flat Armor Pen so it builds out of Brutalizer and the baby Essence Reaver Riot has been planning so it has the identity as the other Legendary build path for Brutalizer and sister item to the new Black Cleaver, instead of a worse Bloodthirster, for AD mana based casters. By giving Essence Reaver flat Armor Pen, but not attack speed or crit, it favors AD casters who don&#039;t make much use of auto attacks. Furthermore, champions that don&#039;t use mana or are resourceless will have more trouble using this item since it will not be as cost efficient for them. I would also recommend having it so Baby Essence Reaver triggers mana on auto attack, while Essence Reaver proper triggers on physical damage to differentiate the two and support both mana hungry AD caster and ADC champions.\n\nThoughts and suggestions?\n\nEdit:\nShinobuElveszett had a good suggestion on how a future Essence Reaver could look.\n> [{quoted}](name=ShinobuElveszett,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=zpkbgYs4,comment-id=0015,timestamp=2015-04-08T20:20:02.629+0000)\n>\n> {{summoner:31}} **Wannabe Essence reaver:**\n> {{item:1037}} (875g) + 475g = 1,350g\n> +25 attack damage\n> +10% cooldown reduction\n> **Passive (unique):** Killing a unit restores 6 mana.\n> \n> {{item:3508}} **Essence reaver:**\n> {{item:3134}} (1,337g) + {{summoner:31}} (1,350g) + 563g = 3,250g\n> \n> +50 attack damage\n> +20% cooldown reduction\n> **Passive (unique):** +20 armor penetration\n> **Passive (unique):** Basic attacks restore mana equal to 3% of the physical damage dealt, increased by 1% per every 1% missing mana (up to 6%).\n> The mana restoration passive...

Which is very odd considering the amount of offensive ap mana items. Basically if stacking a tear wasn't efficient on a champion or was just tedious you didn't have any way to fix mana issues. So the item is inherently rather necessary.\n\nAlso, I think while essence reaver seems to not be popular, that doesn't make it bad. The league community closely follow streamers and the pro scene and if anyone famous uses it you won't hear these complaints anymore.\n\nMost importantly, what I'd like to say is that essence reaver is not just an option it's a good option if you know what you want. Once you built up a shield bloodthirster definitely gives you the edge in a duel, however mana issues are a huge limiting factor that take their place whether you want to admit it or not. Essence reaver on lucian for example, (Not gonna lie, I only really play lucian adc) essence reaver is:\n\n{{champion:236}} \n\n1. Cheaper\n2. Gives you enough mana to use q and other spells much more often with no consequence\n3. Give cdr, an underrated stat on caster adcs\n\nWith this item Lucian gains the ability to spam his q much more often offering good poke and wave clear which can quickly overwhelm bt shield advantage. (Which is the only advantage in a fight btw they both give 80 dmg.) Also for each spellcast of course lucian gets a double shot and the dmg for the spell so the cdr is greatly appreciated on lucian. \n\nWith essence reaver and a good head on your shoulders you can often find yourself putting out much more pressure than your rival with a B.T. because they eventually feel pressured to use less spells and want to return to base because of mana issues (looking at you graves) while lucian can keep applying the same amount of pressure. \n\nThe last main reason I buy this item is that it allows you to use spells to farm camps and creeps faster without having to base. At all. Ever. This is  make it an extremely good gateway item for farming up secondary items and participating in more teamfights and drags. \n\nI realize that essence reaver gets torn apart by a lot of famous players and has a very bad reputation so I'm not going to sit here and argue with you about why essense reaver is best because it's not. It's different. 10% lifesteal and shield (B.T. advantage) vs 10% cdr and lots of mana (Essence advantage)  But no one on this post seemed to really be able to find a use for this item and as someone that uses it a lot I thought I'd share my perspective on it. Even though I only build it on Lucian. Although I will admit that the item doesn't help out any champion quite as much as Lucian and Ezreal in my opinion simply because these champions specifically are ad caster that deal a lot of on hit dmg to replenish their mana with and there is a direct correlation between how much mana that have and how low their cooldowns are and the dmg they dish out in a teamfight. You can try and be conservative with Lucian and ezreal's mana pools and do just fine. (Most people do.) But you can't deny the increase in dmg output from being able to spam so hard.\n\nI'd also like to add that if the mana portion got buffed, it would become a lot more viable on other champions such as Graves, Corki, Yorick, and Jayce. Which would give it a larger strategic niche in which you can use it. Although I don't think that's necessary because a lot of items are unpopular or highly situational and evening out the use of these items isn't really a priority to make the game better and often just shifts the the balance of power in unpredictable ways. The only reason to buff or change items in the game are really to buff or nerf champions in the game that use it or to make other item paths more viable. And Essence Reaver seems to be a perfectly viable build bath even though it's not popular.\n\n I also may as well include my build path because it doesn't make sense for me to recommend a single item without the build path I think works best for it. And who knows, some brave souls might actually want to try it\n\n1. Essence Reaver \n2. Cdr boots (Eventually with Furor enchantment. You run very fast after an auto with this and tri and it's very easy to keep up with people.)\n3. Tri-Force\n4.Last whisper \n5. /6. Then any combination of:\n* Bloodthirster (if I need to get a bit tankier but still want to focus on dmg) \n* Mercurial Scimitar \n* Youmuu's Ghostblade (I rarely get this buy it's particularly good vs master yi as you can pop this and run at the same speed as him so he can't get autos off while you channel your ult. A full channel of Lucian ult especially with yomus popped is enough to kill a squishy master yi even if he's fed enough to 2 or 3 shot you.)\n* Banshee's Veil\n* Infinity Edge (For the highest burst dmg)\n* Guardian Angel\n* or Blade of the Ruined King (For tank busting. Which you'll have to do often in this cinderhulk meta.)\n\nI realize this build is very off meta and it's basically an ad ezreal build but it works and it works well. The tri-force does a very nice job of giving you crucial defense stats you would gotten from B.T. and make him scrappier while the zeal is crucial for letting you use your double shot procs faster and occasionally crit which is very nice. And the sheen is extremely nice given the amount of spellcasts you make in the build and the fact that you will be auto attacking after each of these casts. The CDR boots are just to help you further abuse the sheen and near infinite mana and allow you to do to dash, use you q and w double shot procs and then have your dash back up. Allowing you to relentlessly combo enemies with spells with no clear weak times when your spells are down.\n\nIf anyone has any question or comments of course I'll be happy to answer them but like I said I won't argue with you as to which item is better.

Ideally, the baby component should have a strong enough tradeoff that only the most mana-hungry champions would rush it, but there's also a risk that all marksmen would end up getting it early on just because of how long it would allow them to last in lane while spamming spells.\n* I think one mistake Riot made when testing Soul Sickle (a short-lived mid-tier component to ER) is that they gave it both mana sustain and life steal: not only does the life steal not do much for people who'd pick this early (e.g. aggressive AD casters looking to apply more pressure through spells), it also means picking this item would let marksmen stick to bot lane like a barnacle by playing passively, which would turn laning into a boring farm-fest. Giving the component CDR instead of life steal would allow spell-based AD champions to play a lot more aggressively with spells on all fronts, without touching their healing in lane.\n* I don't think armor pen works for Essence Reaver because there are already a lot of items out there better-suited for killing squishies ({{item:3142}} , for example, is a caster/autoattacker hybrid item that does just that). The idea of sustain on Essence Reaver also makes sense, because you're already purchasing it for mana sustain.\n* With that said, life steal isn't really the best stat here, since it doesn't synergize with most spells. I think Essence Reaver should be turned into a premium sustain item for AD casters by having its life steal apply on ability-based physical damage too, at least against champions. I don't think the mana restoration should apply to spells, though, since past a certain amount of damage you'd trivialize mana costs, whereas having it only apply on autoattacks means you'd have to alternate between spells and basic attacks to top up.\n\n**TL;DR** I think Essence Reaver should be turned into _the_ go-to sustain item for AD casters. It definitely needs a mana restoration component to be viable, though doing so without disrupting attrition mechanics in bot lane would be tough to do.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Visigoth","date":"2015-04-08T19:56:01.066+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:80}} {{champion:2}} _Heavy Breathing_","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cindikle","date":"2015-04-08T19:09:01.881+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It just needs the item that was on the PBE that gave it the mana leach passive that built into ER. \n\nProblem is that the champions who would build it, wont be rushing it. They often want Brutalizer early. Probably T1 boots. After that they usually get their AD item or Last Whisper. If you're past the early game and are not needing mana anymore you'd get BT. If you needed mana you probably got a Tear in the lanning phase. Which costs ~1k less, brings more consistent mana regen tools and the active is powerful. Like ER you wont be finishing either one later. So you may as well get the one that's actually a late game item with equal power for 1k less. \n\nIt needs a reason to be a rush item to work. Late game Tear wins. Mid game maybe ER is better, but they're often better options to work around your mana issues.","replies":[]},{"poster":"bulldoggamer","date":"2015-04-08T17:40:15.213+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It could use to have an item to build out of that grants the mana passive early on in the game. Like first back early on. And it honestly use either some more AD (I think that would be the best option), armor pen,  crit chance, or add the spellblade passive. I think it needs to be able to be a reasonable first item instead of an IE or have it serve a similar purpose to brutalizer, or haunting guise, where you sit on the base item for most of the game and eventually make it your 4th or 5th item.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Auz the Ripper","date":"2015-04-08T17:25:14.922+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was thinking it should build out of {{item:1038}} + {{item:3024}} \nAnd the stats to:\n{{item:3508}}  Essence Reaver\n80 AD \n20 armor \n300 mana \n10% CDR\nUNIQUE PASSIVE: Your basic attacks restore mana equal to between 2% and 8% of the physical damage dealt, based on your missing mana.\n\nThe armor is more valuable to the AD caster who would use essence reaver than lifesteal because AD casters either\nA: want to survive until their combo is finished and then have no intention of sticking around (Ala {{champion:126}}, {{champion:80}}, and maybe {{champion:91}})\nB: have other ways of sustaining themselves built into their kits (I.E. {{champion:6}}  or {{champion:83}})\n\nHowever the comparably low armor and high price would still make it still less desirable to champions who don't need the mana sustain over a straight AD item and a straight armor item so it wouldn't become an abusive armor/AD item.\n\nAdditionally the mana would give it increased synergy with manamune and item","replies":[]},{"poster":"Xela Syab","date":"2015-04-08T12:54:50.917+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Idk I buy it and it works for me, gives me good lane pressure where I can keep spamming abilities.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Venowolf","date":"2015-04-08T10:32:58.875+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Essence Reaver can be a item to the AD Caster need Brutalizer and some kind of Mini Reaver to make it work.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Krys Star","date":"2015-04-08T08:39:31.347+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I was playing a game, and noticed Cloak of Agility only has two build paths.
