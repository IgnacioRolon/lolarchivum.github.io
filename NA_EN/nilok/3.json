And his kills and assists both went down by less than half a point in each column.  Basically, the only statistic that drastically changed from 6.14 to 6.15 was his banrate.

Kappa\n\nI knew this would be brought up.\n\nHere's the thing: Malzahar has always excelled at locking down a target for a guaranteed 2.5 seconds (sans anything that cancels/disrupts the effect) in team fights or when catching someone out, allowing his team to focus and kill the target. It can be game-winning in solo queue, which comes to no surprise that the pros have caught on to it. You may be wondering what took them so long to figure it out.\n\nYou see, before the rework, the problem was that outside of the ult, Malzahar offered virtually nothing but damage while having no innate safety, disengage or mobility. Doesn't seem like a big deal in solo queue, but that's **huge** in competitive play. The pros can _easily_ capitalize on those weaknesses, hence why Malzahar was never \"pick or ban\" or even at all popular. Why else do you think they almost always pick champions with mobility and/or disengage? \n\nNow that Malzahar has the pseudo-Banshee's shield, he can't be jumped on and killed so easily anymore, let alone not be completely vulnerable to ganks. That gave the pros the means to bring his targeted 2.5 second lock down into the spotlight. Even if Malzahar loses lane and gets behind, his ult still does work for his team.\n\nSounds just like {{champion:19}}, no?\n\nLike Anidan said, the pros play a different LoL than we do.

You can't look at what they're doing and apply it to us. \nBesides, they are naturally far better with positioning and have full team coordination.

This is probably why he has such low kill rates, he can't even attempt to kill his enemies until he has 3-4 big items. By then the game is either won or lost, so you tend to have only a slight impact on the game kill-wise.  \n\nBasically Riot set out to fix Old Malzahar's issues but instead created entirely new, perhaps even worse, issues while fixing none of the old issues.
