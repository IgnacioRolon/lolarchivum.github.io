Since they are both jungle enchantments, you cannot stack them as you can only have one or the other, so it isn&#039;t a cross interaction problem.\r\n\r\nThis has led me to one of two possibilities, either you didn&#039;t want to try and balance the game with two different AP jungle items like you have for AD, or you had run out of valid slots for you to put items in.\r\n\r\nI understand the second option sounds strange, but if a fairly common problem in computer science when you try and anticipate how large a project is going to be years ahead of time, but then have it grow beyond your expectations and hitting hard limits you put into the program for efficiency.\r\n\r\nHas the game engine just gotten old enough that it is causing problems in game design, engineering, and balance?\r\nIf so, how feasible would to be to build a new engine with everything you have learned?","replies":[{"poster":"DingleNutsMcGee","date":"2015-06-25T16:09:14.863+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"watch the patch rundown. they explain why they did it","replies":[{"poster":"Nilok","date":"2015-06-26T08:37:31.313+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A bit disappointed that it wasn't a technical problem, but a commitment problem.\n\nFurthermore, the patch rundown has lost a lot of credibility and has been becoming more of a PR tool.","replies":[]}]}]}
