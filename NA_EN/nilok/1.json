However, was retconning the entire lore really the best idea, both for continuity for players and work load?\n\nWhy wasn&#039;t the Institute of War utterly annihilated or simply vanished from the world, summoners and all, without a trace?\n\nThis would have had the world and lore be mostly in the same place we have currently have, maybe with a short time skip to move the world further forwards, but without the need to retcon so many stories that were connected directly to the IoW and summoners, like Jax, Lee Sin, and Ionian Boots of Lucidity to name but a few.\n\nThis also opens up new stories as Demacia, Noxus, Shurima, and all the other city states new and old have to deal with the loss of the major super power that kept balance on the continent for so long and the impending threats like the Harrowing, more and new Void spawn, the Watchers, and everything else as well as each other.\n\nThis also explains why Bard has suddenly appeared after being gone for ages. Without the Institute of War to force their balance, the world is shifting quickly towards utter annihilation, who&#039;s appearance currently doesn&#039;t seem clear or well explained. In fact, Bard almost seems like the Institute of War itself in the from of a champion based on his lore.","replies":[{"poster":"67450548_DEL","date":"2015-05-09T17:31:52.367+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Strawberrycocoa","date":"2015-05-09T20:06:45.462+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":2,"body":"As a former Dawngate player, want to comment on this piece:\n\n>The idea that players could influence the story was pretty misleading – at any “story match,” only ten players would legitimately get to fulfill the role of a summoner. In addition, story by vote or story by chance can often end with unsatisfying results (simply because of the random chance). Strong storytelling is deeply crafted.\n\nDawngate proved to me that player-driven stories CAN work, and work amazingly well.\n\nDawngate used a serial webcomic as it's storytelling (and promotions) vehicle. It had three-to-four interwoven plot lines and when a character hit a crossroads they put the decision to a player vote by using games played to decide (you make your pick, play games, and the more games and wins you get the more votes you contribute).\n\nBut the trick to it is, the player story choices never quite played out how you expected. There was a twist to how it came about.\n\nWhen Zalgus and Raina had to choose between obeying the mission of their Queen to travel to Maridia as envoys, or to delay their arrival to investigate an attack on the abbey where their childhood friend Kindra lived, players chose to have them travel to the abbey.\n\nNow, players already knew from Kindra's backstory in her profile what was going on: Kinda's backstory is that she slaughtered the sisters of her abbey and became a shadowy assassin. So what we *expected* of the Kindra story was that Zalgus and Raina catch Kindra in the act of slaughter.\n\nWhat happened instead is this: Zalgus and Raina arrive at the abbey in the aftermath. Bodies are being burned on a pyre, the abbey is a wreck. They investigate, and Zalgus learns the truth of their childhood friend through clairvoyance magic but spares his sister (Raina) that knowledge. They find a little girl, traumatized and terrified, hidden behind some rubble.\n\nThis little girl, however, was a Shaper. The spirit of Terror had bound to her, taking the form of a large wave of ectoplasm.\n\nThe terrified little girl lashed out at Raina and Zalgus with tendrils of glowing slime, scattering everything around her. Raina, whose spirit was Preservation, called up shards of stained glass from a broken window and empowered them into a shield to defend themselves until the girl wore herself out and collapsed. They carried her out of the abbey to safety.\n\nSo instead of the expected story of Zalgus and Raina catching Kindra doing the atrocities we already knew she did, we got a new character introduced who would have been a playable shaper down the line, and a new Raina skin themed around that stained glass shield.\n\nPlayer Choices brought about that story path. A new skin and a new character came about from our decisions, but with the way the writing was handled, it still felt engaging. Emotional investment of the readers was still a huge part of it. It was player choice that was ALSO deeply crafted.\n\nWhat I am getting at is, you CAN have it both ways. Engaging the players directly in a compelling story to flesh out the gameplay was an amazing thing, and I'd love to see Riot pursue it.","replies":[{"poster":"Ebonmaw Dragon","date":"2015-05-09T22:47:05.822+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Strawberrycocoa,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=lgL6PLhd,comment-id=00000003,timestamp=2015-05-09T20:06:45.462+0000)\n>\n> As a former Dawngate player, want to comment on this piece:\n> \n> Dawngate proved to me that player-driven stories CAN work, and work amazingly well.\n\nI dont think that EA thinks the same\n\nhttp://rs1253.pbsrc.com/albums/hh594/NKassirer/Reaction%20Gifs/Random%20or%20Other/RegularShoooooohhhhhh.gif~c200","replies":[{"poster":"DG Ashabel","date":"2015-05-09T23:08:46.457+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not sure EA can actually *think*.

Jaredan gave a frustratingly obfuscated answer when asked about it, but other evidence speaks louder than that. Opeli hasn't posted around these parts for at least three months and her Twitter account has been deleted, while Tom Abernathy - the previous senior narrative designer - has rather loudly quit some months ago, and his biting and dismissive remarks hinted that he might have been fired over the negative response to the retcon/reboot/whatever you may call it.\n\nThe thing is, just because that was the explanation way back then, doesn't mean it's *still* the explanation six months later, especially given that huge parts of the narrative team have swapped out and Riot Games doesn't actually have a senior narrative designer (which means they don't have a narrative direction either).","replies":[{"poster":"Tesla Effect","date":"2015-05-09T21:14:37.957+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yes, I want to know as well.

That's like having two chefs in one kitchen or two directors on one movie. The purpose of the SND is to make sure that the work of the entire narrative department flows together into a single vision, therefore two narrative designers is detrimental to a cohesive project because there would be two separate visions.\n\nThat said, the first time someone spotted that position on the career list was about a month or two after Tom Abernathy quit. In addition, one of Abernathy's last comments on Riot Games was a scathing claim that the position of a narrative lead doesn't exist within the company. It's safe to assume that they're trying to employ a new Senior Narrative Designer after Abernathy quit, just like it would be safe to assume that Riot has been operating without someone in that position for the last six months (therefore the extremely sluggish developments with narrative).\n\nI said it before, but I don't envy them. It's pretty hard to find a senior narrative designer in this industry, let alone one with four years of experience. A narrative designer with that sort of pedigree would sooner join a company that specializes in story-driven games, since it would give them more opportunity to showcase their work and turn their name into a brand. Not only that, but joining a company that so recently had a huge public controversy regarding their narrative department is simply too much of a career risk.","replies":[{"poster":"Nilok","date":"2015-05-09T21:51:34.908+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good digging on your part and that is some pretty sour news.\n\nIf it has been up for six months with no takers for a major position in an prominent company like Riot, than that means Mr. Abernathy's exit may have poisoned the well for Riot looking for established Senior Narrative Designers.

If they had explored some aftermath of a Runeterra without an IoW, however small, it would have expanded the story instead of restarting it. I can understand Disney doing this with Star Wars' expanded universe since that is **massive** and instead picking the best parts out of it or making nods to it, but Riot has a deep understanding on their lore, its history, and can use it to turn that 'duct tape' into something solid.

Here's another solution. )","replies":[{"poster":"GreenLore","date":"2015-05-09T22:59:29.729+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"There are some problems with that.First of all Rek'sai is a beast,she isn't just unable to speak,but she is literally a wild animal and the Q&A made it sound that even the other void creatures aren't eager to come close to her,so I doubt that Malzahar(Who isn't even from the void) would be able to convince her into cooperation.\n\n\nThen there is the fact that even if a summoner was able to slap some summoning spell on her,then why WOULDN'T they imprison her?They could simply summon and capture her.In fact its been implied that there is no need for slapping a summoner spell on her in the first place,because like i already said,summoners have demonstrated to summon champs against their will either way,which they basically did with all the other-world champs(yeah even being on a different world didn't protect them) and lee sin also tried to summon a beast from the kumungu jungle and only failed due to his inexperience.\n\nIt would also easily help the shurimans getting rid of her,they'd just need to be like \"uh summoners could you just summon her into a volcano or something like this?I mean its not like she is really needed in the league since we already have over 100 champs and she doesn't get along with anyone anyway\"","replies":[{"poster":"DG Ashabel","date":"2015-05-09T23:31:45.297+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"A lot of those are very good points! I'll have to consider them if I ever go back to that story, though it might not happen for a while.\n\nI do feel equipped to answer some of those with possible solutions.\n\n1. \"Could you just summon her into a volcano or something?\" Summoning isn't the same as teleportation. While we do have cases of summoners teleporting champions in the Fields of Justice, we don't know if such free-range teleportation is available without a psychic link and a magically infused place like the Summoner's Rift. If it was, Valoran wouldn't have such problems as bandits and piracy because every major business would simply teleport their goods around. Poor Gangplank would be out of job.\n\n2. Being unable to actually contain Rek'sai could be explained by the purple glow in her tunnels. Perhaps the reason why she can instantly cover huge distance by burrowing is because she can \"burrow\" through the fabric of reality, essentially creating void portals. Something like that would be *very* difficult to contain. Yes, they would be able to use the beacon to pull her back to the desired location, but doing that *every single time* she digs away would be an enormous waste of resources.\n\n3. Given that we already have champions with completely alien mindsets in Fiddlesticks, Nocturne and Zyra, as well as complete lunatics like Renekton and Teemo, I imagine League would have summoners trained in handling the mental strain of linking up with *extremely* irregular cases.","replies":[{"poster":"GreenLore","date":"2015-05-10T10:02:17.144+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"1.Summoners were able to summon others from a different plane of existence without the need of a psychic link.Lee sin tried to summon a beast from the kumungu jungle,without a psychic link(and he wouldn't have tried that if it wasn't possible).Even if the volcano thing wasn't possible,it would allow them a well prepared attack against Rek'sai.\nAnd well the thing is Gangplank is out of job,his lore mentions that he had to give up piracy to become a champion :p.\nBut the big difference here is that Rek'sai is a monster,there is no reason for her to get any special protection from anyone and she makes a large part of shurima completely uninhabitable.The criminals of most city states are either not nearly enough of a problem or joined the league and thus gained protection from it.\n\n2.This is actually a good point,though I find it hard to believe that the powerful summoners wouldn't be able to find a way to restrict her movements.Or it would at least allow for a coordinated strike against her.\n\n3.Its not about Summoners linking their minds with the champ,the question is more how the link functions.I remember that it was explained that champs like swain and j4 aren't trying to kill each other simply because they can't(because there isn't any friendly fire on the SR),which implies that the summoner doesn't have complete control over the champ on the fields of justice,which again would beg the question,why rek'sai goes along with all this.The complete control thing is also something riot didn't want to have,so it would bring another problem back into the game.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"67450548_DEL","date":"2015-05-09T20:27:16.068+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":4,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Nilok","date":"2015-05-09T20:33:26.195+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"The reason I say a year is due to the amount of respect I have for Riot.

In addition, one of Abernathy's last comments on Riot Games was a scathing claim that the position of a narrative lead doesn't exist within the company. It's safe to assume that they're trying to employ a new Senior Narrative Designer after Abernathy quit, just like it would be safe to assume that Riot has been operating without someone in that position for the last six months (therefore the extremely sluggish developments with narrative).\n> \n> I said it before, but I don't envy them. It's pretty hard to find a senior narrative designer in this industry, let alone one with four years of experience. A narrative designer with that sort of pedigree would sooner join a company that specializes in story-driven games, since it would give them more opportunity to showcase their work and turn their name into a brand.
