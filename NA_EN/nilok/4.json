At face value it doesn't seem like much, move a passive to an active, make it more reliable and a couple other tweaks and that's it. However, I feel that moving Voidlings from being a passive to an active has fundamentally missed a core design and gameplay concept for Malzahar that leaves him a worse feeling champion.\n\nTo go on, I need to first explain how on a concept level Malzahar's passive worked and enriched his story and gameplay.\nFirst and foremost, Malzahar isn't a summoner, not intentionally. Malzahar's core design is about tearing the world and the minds of those around him apart and through the reality and broken minds flow the Voidspawn. This was a smart way to bring Malzahar's lore directly into the gameplay and make great callbacks to the Lovecraftian inspiration that the Void was spawned from. To drive home the fact that Malzahar never intentionally called forth these Voidspawn, Malzahar could not directly control them like Annie's Tibbers, instead he could at best direct them with his Void enriched spells.\n\nHowever, when you compare this to Malzahar's current gameplay, it isn't cohesive on concept level. Instead of tearing the world and minds around him apart to summons his Voidlings, he simply summons them at will. This is further complicated by the fact that even though Malzahar intentionally summoned them, he has no control over them. While it could be explained, it lacks the intuitive nature of the previous design concept.\n\nDue to the problems the current Void Shift passive has with making Malzahar play extremely passively and refuse to engage with the enemy, I strongly recommend returning to Malzahar's core gameplay concept and having Malzahar's Voidlings once again be his passive.\n\n\"I know always that I am an outsider; a stranger in this century and among those who are still men.\" - H.P. Lovecraft - The Outsider\nhttp://img12.deviantart.net/0cd9/i/2014/182/6/4/malzahar_wallpaper_by_markussoo7-d7or73v.jpg\n\nEDIT:\nI also just realized a brilliant designed decision for the old design team when they designed Malzahar.\nThe balance reason why Malzahar's Voidlings are attached to a set number of spell casts instead of a single ability is to prevent Malzahar from playing passively like he is now. In order to get a Voidling, you would have to push the wave, spend mana, and interact with your opponent, while how he is now, he just gets the Voidlings and doesn't have to invest in aggressive plays to get them. With how Void Shift works currently, it only compounds the problem with Malzahar able to free summon Voidlings.\n\nEDIT TLDR: Voidling as a passive makes Malzahar play more aggressively to get them, while the Void Shift passive and Void Swarm makes Malzahar play passively.","replies":[{"poster":"Troll for Trump","date":"2016-08-08T13:23:50.048+0000","up_votes":25,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeah, they shifted too much of his power budget into voidlings; He's not really a mage anymore","replies":[{"poster":"Nilok","date":"2016-08-08T13:30:44.088+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"True, there is too much power in his current W, but I feel his current passive also encourages unhealthy gameplay.\n\nMore than that though, by shifting his Voidlings to his W, they removed one of his core designs and made him closer to Yorick.","replies":[{"poster":"Troll for Trump","date":"2016-08-08T13:36:16.127+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeah, the {{champion:83}} {{champion:90}} {{champion:268}} types end up being really unfun to play against.\n\nThe thing is, Azir and Yorick have an entire kit based on their summoned minions.\n\nWhen Riot reworked Malz, they wanted to keep both the AD malz playstyle with voidlings, and the AP caster.

Mages should be more focused on their abilities, and AP-based abilities. Malz should NOT be an AD Caster/skirmisher.\n\nYou can have minions, but if you do, your kit should be based on it, like Azir.\n\nThink Annie. Tibbers is interesting, but how well does it flow with her kit? Tibbers itself feels useless and uncohesive with the rest of Annie's kit. It can be used to sieging/tanking, but that's not what Annie should be. Tibbers, a summoned minion, is just known for the initial AOE dmg/stun, and not the actual summoned minion, which is sorta an issue. \n\nFor AP Malz,same thing. The minions will still help split, but they're useless for fighting and other situations if you go AP Malz. If you go AD Malz, Malz's E does 0 dmg, and is basically the click command for your voidlings, and the Q is just a silence that's mana inefficient. \n\nThe voidlings don't fit Malz's mage playstyle, and end up being an anomaly for his AP Kit. Ad Malz shouldn't be forced onto Ap Malz's kit. If you build AD or AP, it makes half of his abilities useless, depending on the path you choose. \n\nBecause Riot wants both AD and AP Malz to be viable, the abilities are balanced in a bad way. Only one \"ability\" is for AD Malz player's: His W. Since that's Malz's only AD-scaling ability, that ability has to be really powerful, and entice players to build AD. This is at the expense of the power of AP Malz's abilities.","replies":[{"poster":"Tobias Brackner","date":"2016-08-08T22:37:37.277+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Voidling Details:Attacks deal 0 physical damage plus 10/15/20/25/30 (+10% Ability Power) magic damage","replies":[{"poster":"Troll for Trump","date":"2016-08-08T22:58:38.068+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"[What?](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Malzahar)\n\n「 PHYSICAL DAMAGE: 30 / 32.5 / 35 / 37.5 / 40% AD 」\n「 BONUS MAGIC DAMAGE: 10 / 15 / 20 / 25 / 30 (+ 10% AP) 」","replies":[{"poster":"Tobias Brackner","date":"2016-08-08T23:22:49.593+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"> they're useless for fighting and other situations if you go AP Malz\n\nBut as you can clearly see they do dmg even if you are AP.","replies":[{"poster":"Troll for Trump","date":"2016-08-08T23:53:24.352+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Barely any.

I hate the new Malzahar.  I think a big part about why I hate him is because new Malz reminds me of my old champ, but feels different. Feels wrong.  I loved the old kit.\n\nI agree that voidlings work way better as a passive. As you said, it forced me to use my abilities and be aggressive.  Also what made me good was my voidling management, especially in lane.  It added a depth of strategy.  Use them properly to push farm or harass to your best potential.  Now every time it's off CD I can just shove the lane very easily and safely.  Worst of all it feels clunky to use in a rapid combo situation.  Null zone used to flow so much better.\n\nI agree his new passive promotes passive gameplay.  Now I am likely to sit back for 20 seconds while it CDs in lane so I can be harder to gank.\n\nI really really miss Null Zone.  It was an amazing team fight tool.  Great for zoning, yet so easy to walk off of.  Putting it on his ult makes his ult feel really bad to use sometimes.

It did too much damage while leaving you almost no options.  The way to fix that is to make it either do direct % damage to it's target, or flat damage up to a certain % of targets max hp.  That way catching a wayward adc with your ult alone wouldn't burn them for 75% of their health leaving them with no option.  The second option is good because then you don't do stupid amounts of % damage to tanks.\n\nTL:DR New kit isn't fun to play with or against.

Should you ult the enemy Vayne? Should you ult down Yi? But if you do, what happens if their Leona and Naut have good reactions? This isn't Karthus or Soraka where you can sit back and press R. This is not Fiddlesticks, Morg, and Kennen where you just jump in the middle of everything and use an hourglass without any real variation to the strategy. This is a single-target channel which can be disrupted easily and even negated if Malz is not thinking carefully.\n\nThirdly, you expect people to hit level six and not have a game changing ultimate that can be utilized to win lane/fights? What a strange person.\n\nFourthly, I really don't care if his ultimate is bursty. If they were to keep his ultimate as it was now, while I still feel it would be a bit underwhelming, I would not have as much complaint as I do now because not only do Voidlings break his designed thematic and identity as a champion, they also act as an unhealthy RNJesus on who they attack without Spaceaids, Malz being an immobile champion always posing a problem to that, as well as being body blocks to a good portion of skill shots. People like Ryze, Kha, Veigar, Karma, Rengar, and so forth. While I don't have an issue of having skillshots blocked persay, I would rather it not be because a bunch of Voidlings decided to move off to that random minion/champion to the side just after Spaceaids expired.","replies":[{"poster":"DontChaseBard","date":"2016-08-10T04:45:07.843+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"malzahar is a braindead lane bully. except after the rework he's better in teamfights because of his stupid passive and voidling armies. yes, everyone gets an ultimate at lvl 6 what an astute observation. not everyone gets a 2.5 second suppression that is targetable and deals hella damage. in terms of old malzahar alone, he could one shot you easily for just being in lane once he hit 6, throw down pool and immediately ult, then afterwards quickly E and ignite. as I said before. braindead lane bully. pogchamp","replies":[{"poster":"Keepe","date":"2016-08-10T05:20:38.198+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> You expect people to hit level six and not have a game changing ultimate that can be utilized to win lane/fights?

Not everyone gets a 2.5 second suppression that deals \"Hella\" damage. \n\nNot everyone gets a huge AoE global ult that deals damage in waves.\n{{champion:41}} \n\nNot everyone gets to add on to the Knock Up mechanic and deal \"Hella\" damage while ignoring portions of armor.\n{{champion:157}} \n\nNot everyone gets three dashes to re-position themselves to safety when in the middle of a fight. \n{{champion:103}} \n\nNot everyone increases all physical damage dealt to an opponent and then pops for damage based on the damage dealt.\n{{champion:238}} \n\nNot everyone brings people back from the dead in accordance to Support Jesus.\n{{champion:26}} \n\nI can keep going.\n\nShockingly, my friend, Lane Bullies are not a new concept to League. Sona, Zilean, Annie, Blitzcrank, Thresh, Olaf, Ryze, Teemo... Some people have kits that were simply designed to do such, and Malzahar is one of them. And as for Old Malzahar One Shotting you, he would if you LET him. His ultimate is fairly close range, so you'd have to be particularly bad at kiting and poking for him to get that close once he hits six. Even then, you still miss the point. \n\n> I really don't care if his ultimate is bursty.

It is the Voidlings.","replies":[{"poster":"DontChaseBard","date":"2016-08-10T09:06:39.360+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"except some lane bullies actually do require some skill. when it comes to malzawin he has a simple kit that a braindead monkey could use and win lane with. at the end of the day I have zero respect for people who use that cancerous PoS champion.

Did you have a bad time against him? Were you that one ADC who never bought QSS? Or were you a tank who thought he could go easy on the MR?

Be mindful of your minions, and burst him down.\n\nThat was all he ever was.\n\nHe struggled in team fights if you knew what you were doing, he could easily be focused down. He could easily be forced into a tight spot and blow his ult on a tank out of desperation. As with any champion, you just needed to practice against him to figure out what makes him tick rather than, for example, logging on to the boards and complaining about Spaceaids and demanding a nerf.\n\nHe was never \"Malzawin\" unless you had the skill of, well...

This was most likely done to prevent the trap current Yorick and Malzahar have, sitting back and fighting by proxy with minions by farming and harassing. With classic Malzahar, you never had that problem as you had to be aggressive to get your minions in the first place.\nThis fixed the problem of not engaging with your lane opponent, while also rewarding you for casting spells.\n\nAfter that, due to the leniency the old lore allowed for all different kinds of champions, they could find a lore that made sense why a minion champion had to cast his spells to get his minions and couldn't control them. The inspiration from H.P. Lovecraft and the already existing champion of Kassadin allowed a lore that perfectly explained his game design.","replies":[{"poster":"ChargeItDownMid","date":"2016-08-09T04:54:59.015+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Nilok","date":"2016-08-09T05:05:17.665+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I won't disagree they were in need of an improvement, but the core design concept of not being able to summon your minions without being aggressive and casting spells worked perfectly. This prevented Malzahar from the very passive gameplay of other minion summoning characters and his current design, which allows you to engage him more.\n\nMalzahar currently has a very low kill rate among mid champions, but is incredibly average outside of that, while in the past Malzahar had a much more diverse stat breakdown on sites like Champion.gg. This suggests to me that Malzahar had been inadvertently encouraged to play very passively.\n\nHowever, everything you have said is wrong about the pre-rework Voidlings is also true for it currently. Malzahar's Voidligns are still balanced around terrible ai, worse now in fact as players lost the ability to direct them with auto attacks. In the ideal situation vs a melee champion, they will gut them, but if you walk away, they are impotent.\n\nFinally, Malzahars pre-rework Voidligns were **not** a forgotten part of his kit. It was the focus of expert play and the ultimate reward for playing his kit masterfully was the rare triple Voidlings. That was something you had to earn.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
