Now whenever I'm in a game playing the same thing keeps happening to me. \r\nI've downloaded windows 10 in the last recent months and have a AMD Radeon HD 7800 series graphics card. I've updated my driver to most recent one available. \r\nAnyone know what else could be causing this problem? Thank you.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-04T23:50:25.478+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I haven't seen this happen before, but it sounds like your hardware might be started to fail.
