As I got some information from my Korean friends, same thing is happening with KR server, no sight of an update of Hextech Crafting. I would like to know if whether Tencent doesn't want to have Hextech Crafting (because this will affect their turnover or whether Hextech Crafting is having difficulties on these pictograph language servers or maybe it's because of difference in the skins system (different servers have different specific set of skins). Thanks you!","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-05-23T23:57:39.578+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Keep in mind that League of Legends is published by Tencent in China, and not by Riot Games directly.  Therefore, it is up to Tencent which features are implemented into the client in that region.  Unfortunately, I don't have any direct or specific answers about Hextech Specifically.\n\nI would recommend contacting Tencent to ask directly!","replies":[]}]}
