Maybe (if you actually haven't had any prior punishments like you claim) and you can explain the 2-week ban was made in error, just maybe it will be overturned. \n\nEvery person interprets the punishment system differently. If we're being realistic here, half of those high elo streamers should be punished for frequently being toxic in their own right. \n\n>Speaking of which, since when is arguing with my teammates and having a passive agressive approach to things a permaban-level offense?

Especially when said words can be COMPLETELY ignored and actions cannot. \n\n One thing I'd like to point out is that you're not being duped or tricked here, the rules have been transparent from _day one_ and the consequences of these actions are very clear. You're supposed to work **with** your teammates. It's a team game, calling someone bad is the definition of toxicity/negativity. It's not constructive in any context.\n\n If you feel differently, that's fine. You're welcome to that opinion. But that isn't going to change the rules, if you can't abide by them then maybe League isn't the right fit for you. \n \n> But, as the meme says, it can't be us! It's all the players that are out of touch! \n\n Can't remember where I found the statistic, but Riot themselves have confirmed that the large majority of League players have never received any sort of punishment. Polls that have been held here and on Reddit also suggest the same thing.\n\n Statistically and factually speaking, Riot _isn't_ out of touch as the majority of players can abide by and agree with the rules.\n \n> Something people seem to lack the capacity to understand in general is that it is disturbingly easy to grief with no repercussions, but saying something about it gets you banned - a support can simply decide to not cast spells for the entirety of a laning phase and lose you the game alone, but will never get punished for it - however you will, if you say something negative about him/her. \n\n Because one is readily apparent and the other is not?\n\n Yes, someone _could_ grief by say, not casting spells or using them at inopportune times. You know who could also do that? Someone who is new to the game, someone who is trying out a new champion, or someone who is genuinely underperforming. If Riot is overly strict with the system, new players and underperforming players are unfairly punished. If Riot is not strict enough with the system, actual rulebreakers go by unpunished. \n\nIt's not as black-and-white as something like a chat offense where you can simply check if certain words, phrases, or behaviors are being used. \n\n>This notion that a negative attitude should be reportable and punished is beyond delusional to me, it is a competitive setting and I am not allowed to be unsatisfied? What? What's next, gonna ban Faker or Rekkles or someone else from competitive play cause they cried on stage? This is just hilarious to me\n> \n\n I see this argument come up a lot, and the answer is always the same.\n\n You _do not_ have to coddle other people, you _do not_ have to be polite to them, you _do not_ have to act fake and be everybody's best friend.\n\n You just have to not flame them. It's that simple. Get upset with the state of the game, get annoyed with your teammates if you want, the second you start doing nonconstructive things (such as citing someone's winrate and then saying \"yikes\" in an attempt to discredit them or call them bad like you did in this game), that is considered rulebreaking behavior.\n\n It's that simple.\n\n\n> EDIT: Remember that post of the guy who intentionally griefed and inted what, twenty games in a row in bronze or silver or something?

The idea that a NEW player or someone having a bad game could be the one literally not casting spells? Come on, you know as well as I do that is simply not the case.

I simply refuse to believe that you genuinely think that, you seem smarter than that. Toxicity would be going so far as to insult people, but calling their in game actions bad is anything but toxic, it is commenting on the state of the game and the idea that you can say comment on someone's actions so long as you're telling them they did good and not bad, is just insane. \n\nCalling someone bad and citing their winrate is rulebreaking beahvior?

The issue here is that even when you tell people something nicely, it is taken as flame the majority of the time - I'm sorry but if I'm playing an AD that can somewhat safely stay in lane alone and play weak side, since my jungler has decided to split the map and play topside for... some reason, if my support keeps making awful mistakes and getting either , or both of us killed, I will straight up tell him \"Please leave the lane, roam to wherever you feel is best\", and I have had people very often respond to this by flashing in place in front of the enemy botlane. Sorry but people seriously need to learn they arent infallible. Better players can call you out for mistakes, and should be allowed to do so, and calling someone bad in a competitive environment should NEVER be labeled as toxic.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"zPOOPz","date":"2019-11-03T05:50:11.729+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> and you deserve to be called out for making awful mistakes\n\nAnd this is where Rito said you are not allowed to do that.  You are entitled to your believe that people \"deserve\" this.  But Rito does not believe this and what they believe is THE laws within this game.  You can either abide by their rules or find some other games that shared your belief.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"iBuild","date":"2019-11-03T02:26:09.496+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"tbh try reading your comments again?

Like, you were being a jerk here, no matter how crappy your team is. You figured that because you avoided the big no-no words you'd be fine, and free to be a jerk. After all, there's always people more toxic than you, so why would you get punished? Turns out that wasn't the case, huh bud?

Sure, I wasn't being nice, but what they did to me in game far outweighs what I typed, remember, you can mute someone, no matter how toxic or annoying or whatnot they might be, but there is nothing I can do when my jungler decides to do drake 5 inches from my face while the enemy toplaner is solokilling me, nor can I do anything about him spamming an emote as I die. Toxic chat behavior is negligible when compared to toxic gameplay, teammates refusing to assist you in any way shape or form, supports picking mages and outright taxing entire waves off their ADC, people spamming emote on you when you die after they baited you, teammates openly refusing to cast spells just so you can die and they can have a laugh while typing out \"please report X for inting\" in allchat. \n\nMaybe don't be so smug and happy that someone got banned, it shows way too much sadism.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"iron4playa","date":"2019-11-03T15:49:16.921+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you spend the whole game typing which is a form of trolling and rule breaking, that alone without the content being rule breaking themselves that is. then if we look at the actual content of your chat logs, you are breaking rules consisently throughout the chat logs, the punishment was perfectly deserved.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-11-03T05:12:38.278+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That doesn't seem like the kind of chat that would result in a 14-day suspension on an account with no prior punishments.
