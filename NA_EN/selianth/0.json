Skins that you own for him might show up as \"Unavailable\" on your profile tab. Not to worry though, this is only a visual bug, as during champion select you will still be able to select any skin that you own for Ryze. :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"fyrepixel","date":"2016-07-13T16:14:22.589+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, i had professor ryze, and it was not showing up either, thank god i thought Riot took it away because i just didnt play ryze much or something","replies":[]}]}
