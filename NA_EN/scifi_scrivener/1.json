I was about to get into promos and lost 20 lp because a shen went afk at lvl4. That is ridiculous. In a competitive ranked environment, players should not be penalized because a random team mate decides to not play.\r\n\r\nIf you go AFK in ranked you should be banned from rank matches for 30 days. Riot needs to find a harsh penalty that discourages casual players from infecting ranked games.\r\n\r\nOk, enough ranting. I really enjoy LoL and think the community in game is generally awesome. Riot just needs to weed out these few bad apples that ruin the fun for the rest of us.","replies":[{"poster":"Fuh Queue","date":"2017-07-23T22:57:04.967+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This will never happen. The reason it has been said many times without Riot taking any action is because there isn't a plausible way to implement a system that won't get abused.","replies":[{"poster":"SciFi Scrivener","date":"2017-07-23T23:19:39.032+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know you're right, but it still doesn't make me think someone should be at least researching this and telling the community they understand the problem and would like to find a solution.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2017-07-23T22:24:09.281+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So someone had a family accident and they had 0 choice but to leave and assist said family member, do you actually believe they deserve to be banned for 30 days from ranked?","replies":[{"poster":"Fuh Queue","date":"2017-07-23T22:55:47.532+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This happened to me on this account. The game made it to the loading screen right as my mother called me and needed immediate attention. I couldn't tell her to wait 30-45 minutes for me to finish a game, she is obviously more important, especially since she is terminally ill. Even though I opted to leave the game in the loading screen so my team could remake, I still got punished with a 5 game 20 minute low priority queue. So there is still punishments to people that leave games, even if you think there isn't.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SciFi Scrivener","date":"2017-07-23T23:18:36.047+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Yes.
