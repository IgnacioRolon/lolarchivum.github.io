Naturally the best outcome is that a game ends quickly with a good distribution of  kda where everyone on your team has large numbers of deaths and low kills.\n\nHOWEVER, what if someone, like you, who is really playing happens to have low deaths and some kills.\n\n\nWELL then naturally, the death/kill ratio needs to be equalized. So for the next 10-20 minutes, your \"team\" will rack up kills while the enemy team only goes after you, and your \"team\" bizarrely pauses while surrounded by enemy champs for no apparent reason, then go into a frenzy of activity.\n\n\nBecause riot has instlled a DELIUSIONAL thought process whereby, the end game stats can be used to explain everything, naturally the true in game context and series of events is lost, unless of course, you meticulously track your games, and realize, LIKE I DID, my games had ZERO to do with my cs, kda, mechanics or other BS, and 80%+ had to do with trolls.\n\nAnyone calling for surrender in my games is reported. There is no reason to surrender almost ever. Only 1% of games have a legitimate reason to surrender.","replies":[]},{"poster":"zrWQMdGHtY","date":"2016-10-02T18:59:22.338+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/64702586/No.jpg","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2016-10-02T18:21:01.162+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It depends. Specifically refusing to kill the nexus could probably be considered assisting the enemy team. If you mean they are struggling to make the last push and they try to finish off the enemy so they can take the nexus instead of taking the nexus outright, that would just be a poor play not intentionally refusing to end.\n\nI honestly haven't heard anyone question this in the past so if someone else has more insight I would like to know as well.","replies":[]}]}
