I first had a draven get hit by my bind then flash out instantly. Then after that I tried a flash bind but even though I binded after flash it threw the bind from the original spot i was rather then after the flash. If someone knows what this is whether it's a bug or if they actually changed it.\n\nIf this is a bug I'll report it but I'm pretty sure it's not supposed to do this.","replies":[{"poster":"Dark Morgana","date":"2015-11-10T19:49:40.328+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey CripTic,\n\nAs a main Morgana Support, I have been experiencing the same issue. You should take this to the bug boards so that way Riot can look into it. It hurts my heart everytime I throw that ULT and it cuts out due to a bug with her.
