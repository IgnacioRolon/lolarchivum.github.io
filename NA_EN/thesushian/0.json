It&#039;s very annoying, because visual timing in a teamfight with ekko is a clusterf**k if you can&#039;t see half of your spells on grouped champs.\r\n\r\nSimple way to reproduce is to just q with ekko, and note that when it returns through any enemy, it plays no hit sound. Very annoying.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-03-28T17:43:47.570+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey TheSushian! \n\nThanks for the report!
