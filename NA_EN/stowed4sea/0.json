Rather, I used to. I&#039;m tired of watching the same champions get picked week after week. Just watching a game or two per week, I never got fatigued, however this season, I&#039;ve seen nearly every single NA LCS game.\r\n\r\nHas Riot thought about any other ideas for limiting this? Am I the only one who cares?\r\n\r\nJust spit-balling ideas:\r\n\r\n1. Remove champions with a pick+ban % from selection during a given week. This would force a few other champions into the mix.\r\n2. In each series, if a champion was picked/banned by either team in the previous match, it is removed from selection for the rest of the series.\r\n3. Have a snake format draft at the beginning of the year. Each team takes turns drafting two exclusive champions to be used on their team for the rest of the season. This is the most limiting form, as it would mess up worlds, or else every league would have to compete in the same initial draft at the beginning of the year. You could even expand this to drafting the entire champion pool spread out between the pro teams of the world in something like reverse order of previous year standing, but that seems doubtful.\r\n\r\nAnyway, those are just a few ideas off the top of my head. Each probably has several reasons why it wouldn&#039;t work or be good for LOL eSports. I&#039;m sure there are better options. If I&#039;m the only one who cares, then that&#039;s fine, but I&#039;m just wondering if Riot has talked about this at all or if others are as tired as me of watching LOL eSports. If I&#039;m the only one then that&#039;s fine, I&#039;ll just watch less often.\r\n\r\nI searched for similar threads but couldn&#039;t find any, sorry if already asked and answered.","replies":[{"poster":"Miror B","date":"2016-07-10T23:40:44.027+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Doublelift actually did a \"chat\" about the new LCS and its massive loss of viewership recently, will try to share a snippit of it. Sum of it though: LCS is far more \"forced\" now as people are having to watch their favorite teams instead of all the teams (unless they want to spend 20 hours a week watching videos), because of this it's causing a bit of a split where the newer/\"neutral\" audience probably won't watch much of it or won't get to see all the teams while the devoted audience (fanboys) will still only watch their favorite teams, causing little exposure for the other ones.","replies":[{"poster":"TBakes","date":"2016-07-11T17:24:33.013+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He also was talking about how best of 3s are more stale because there is literally less diverse team match-ups. In best of 1s you would see each team match up against two other teams each day, which is literally more dynamic than each team only playing two other teams 2-3 times in two days. \n\nFor example, you would see Immortals play TSM and P1 one day and then nV and NRG the next day. That is a lot more dynamic to watch than   Immortals playing P1 2-3 times one day and then TSM 2-3 times the next day. It is a trade-off in quality of each viewing session. Some probably prefer one over the other. I think the best of 3s make more sense to filter the better teams into the top. Playoffs each split, each invitational, and each Worlds have best of 3 or best of 5 formats, so it doesn't make much sense to send someone who is best at playing one game at a time to face other teams who play multiple games against each other.","replies":[{"poster":"Shadowatom","date":"2016-07-11T21:13:55.038+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That is not how the Bo1 format used to be.

I mean does it bother me some yeah a little bit but its not just the champions that matters but the players who play them. \n  Doublelift could play Lucain and go ham 24/7 , while Sneaky picks Lucian and plays passive so you will always get multiple sides of the same coin in some ways.  \n  I also know that its a business and they want to win.  The pros will not play champions that suck just so fans can love them for it, no they want to win.   The fans will come around when the Wins pile up.  \n\n  Its also the meta each year it changes, however season 6 was the biggest one. \n\nSeason 4 I think the year SSW won Worlds, players could sustain and pick any champion they want and fight around the 30-35 mins after lane phase.  Most games lasted around 40-50 min mark.   So any champion will do for example Alistar top-Support.  \n\nSeason 5 Saw less lane phase and more fights but the games still lasted around the 35-40 min mark but the sustain was still there with flask etc.  So picking champions that had great team fighting potential was needed.  \n\nSeason 6 its really just play champions that don't need sustain as most of the sustain items and masteries are now gone and its fight fight fight with shot calling on the side.  \nThis season is also the most snowballing season to date so picking champions that can snowball easily without too many items is what it calls for.  \n\nI don't know if my post makes sense but hope it helps, just wanted to get my opinion and thoughts on the matter. \nThank you and Have a Good One !","replies":[{"poster":"CrazedPorcupine","date":"2016-07-11T08:57:27.990+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The meta shifts on a patch by patch basis. However, seeing Azir a staple pick in the LCS since his release? That's boring, that's annoying, and should be changed.\n\nOther than that, The season has had some interesting picks. Ashe and Sivir's resurgance, alongside the fairly diverse picks of Tristana, Kalista, Lucian, Ezreal, and Corki (Albeit, kalista and corki falling out of favor with itemization changes and direct nerfs) and Cait, means that ADC has been fairly diverse. The rise of poke/mage supports as well as passive sustain supports is fantastic after 3 seasons of non-stop tanks and Morgana. Overall, While the mid lane is fairly stale, diversity among other roles is at an all time high imo.\n\nI mean, Pro-play will never be as diverse as Dota 2s, but that comes from how the ban/select phase plays out, with it constantly swapping between picks/bans throughout the entirety of select, resulting in more counterpicks, counter bans for specific teamcomps, and more Niche champions being able to shine by ensuring that a champion select or banning phase/pick phase does not shut them down.","replies":[{"poster":"III BAKURYU III ","date":"2016-07-11T11:10:17.596+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Indeed.

It also really makes me wonder just how many champions are actually viable in the current meta, but teams are just scared to try anything new.

It wasn't until really this week that I saw it in NA, and only twice I think on Sunday. \n\nOnce may be able to make the point that other champions are more than viable, but NA is just slow to adapt and try new things.

However, within a season, game to game is the problem I have.\n\nI've heard several people mention the DOTA pick/banning now, looked it up for myself.  I wonder how it would change up the LCS if it was done in a similar fashion.  Here is wishing for something like that in the future.

Each team starts off with 2 bans, then it follows with two picks from each team in snake order, then another round of bans come out, with to more bans for each team. Then more picking and one final ban for each team before the 5th champion is selected.\n\nThis method seems to allow more variation because instead of just blind banning, you get a chance to react to a team build all through the draft.  At least that seems to be the consensus from what I've found. \n\nI don't think changing something as simple as a pick/ban method could result in a lawsuit.  I believe US courts have already determined in many cases, with all types of media, that you can protect the title/name of something, but you cannot patent an idea or concept in a board game, music, or video game.  I don't see any problem with copying ideas that work.  All of league of legends, or any MOBA for that matter is really a near clone of DOTA.  I say use it if it works, and let the people who want to keep arguing about DOTA vs League of legends keep arguing.","replies":[{"poster":"III BAKURYU III ","date":"2016-07-11T23:09:03.742+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I thought about something like that once and it does- it makes sense and helps with eliminating random champions that the enemy team could have just played once or twice in a scrim to just play it and not to play it in the LCS.  \n\n  XD  I didn't mean lawsuit or anything legal but it could never know, I meant just the fans reactions that League copied of Dota or vice versa but I see the points and it does make sense as far as the pick bans. \n\n  Nice comment and Have a Good One","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Shadowatom","date":"2016-07-10T23:17:49.311+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel like this split is much better than last split imo.
