My ping will be sitting at 27, and my fps is always 60. There's no indication that I'm lagging. However, in game I'll be playing and sometimes it feels like a slide show, not as bad to that extend at all. Just a champion will appear later on my screen than I know they should have or a hiccup sorta thing. Enough to make a big difference in kiting/skill shots. Anyone with the same experience?","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-06-23T00:40:31.900+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"From reading about your issue, my instincts tell me that you might be experiencing packet loss on your connection.
