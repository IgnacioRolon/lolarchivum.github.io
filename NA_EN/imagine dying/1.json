Keys aren't my issue but the chest haven't been given to me at all and this is killing my patience. I do not want to put my time and effort in trying to get something I already need to be getting after it's available and I am tired of this. First my loot page wouldn't load and the latest patch fixed it but now the chest aren't being given to me. Why??? This is annoying.","replies":[{"poster":"Imagine Dying","date":"2017-08-14T00:03:13.028+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I keep forgetting about the champ per season thing -.- my bad","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sardonic Sloth","date":"2017-08-12T06:19:00.298+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"One chest per champ per season is the maximum you can get.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-12T01:57:05.184+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It looks like the champion you most recently got an S on was with Vi, which you had already received a chest for.

You can only unlock a chest per champ once.\nYou can check by going to your collection page and checking your champions. Anything with a border around them means you have unlocked a chest on them champions.\n\nYou also cannot get chests from champions who are on free rotation who you do not own.","replies":[]}]}
