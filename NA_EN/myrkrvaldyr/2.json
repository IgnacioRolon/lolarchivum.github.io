If they do talk about it soon, it'll only be after the Dark Star game. Maybe a week after.  Otherwise, it'll probably be months.\n\nWhy would Riot not respond to said post?\n\nYour post subject is accusatory and not conversational.  It's conversation material for non-rioters, but if a red badge shows up, they might come under fire.

In addition to announcer packs, needless to say, people have also asked for the option to change the login screen to any of the previous ones since the beginning of League.
