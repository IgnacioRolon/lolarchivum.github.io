The answer to that question would be no, I didn&#039;t even get a second &quot;2 week ban&quot;, Riot went straight to perma ban. The reasoning brhind this is that I used a trigger word for both times I was banned, the trigger word was kill urself, the second time however, it was used in past tense and I was referring to a jax that inted. Please help me reach out to riot so that my ban can be at least reviewed and rejudged. I feel as if this ban was inappropriate and IF ANYTHING I should just get a reduced sentence. I will also be willing to pay for my account on top of a full reform.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-10-13T01:18:15.342+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":1,"body":"You dont get to petition to be unbanned.
