I just got punished for something I didn't do, or at least didn't have any control over. What kind of bullshit is that? I'm not the only one having this issue. I'm not the only one getting punished for nothing.  However, this is the only game I know of that punishes its players for the publisher's mistakes. How come the most played video game in the world doesn't give a single shit about its player base? You have money for LCS and Worlds and every other event but you can't repair a single bug that stops the average player from enjoying their experience. You don't care about us, we're just at the bottom of the hole and we're not worth the effort and the resources, you only care about pro-play because, that brings you money. Sigh, I'm not even angry because of the 3 million hours of bonus wait time before every match. I'm just sorry for those 3 years of my life or something that I've wasted. Also you can block my account for talking shit, or disconnecting from games, because I don't even care. All I got to do is jack off and kill myself. Peace.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Your Pal Shifty","date":"2018-08-01T15:56:50.823+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"After the Akali patch today I am now having the same issue. \n\nLoading screen going into a game is black for a long time then finally loads after 5+minutes.
