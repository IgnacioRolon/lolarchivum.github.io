I've only seen one success story, and that scared me enough to change! It is so depressing that there are these few people who are quick to count us out instead of having faith in us, encouraging us to do better, helping us write appeals, putting the time into looking for the good in us the part of us that wants to change before stepping on our dreams and kicking us while we're down. We get it. We were perma banned! we understand, but you don't have to revel in our pain, you don't have to put salt in our wounds. let us believe there is a way! let us believe we can one day prove that we can be just as good with the league community as you who haven't been perma banned.

They discovered that it doesn't matter what the punishment is, people who are going to change do so. People who aren't going to change keep going.\n\nNow, it sounds as though you figured out your account is valuable to you. That's a good thing. It won't get you your old account back, but it will definitely help going forward.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-01-25T01:41:36.108+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"They used to do a thing where if you put in a support ticket and asked they would let you try to make it to level 20 and if you succeeded without being punished then you could keep your account, but the success rate was only like 2% or something so they stopped because it was just introducing the toxic people to the new players and making the situation worse.","replies":[{"poster":"Ang3LCrVzY","date":"2017-07-14T20:49:14.495+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well that sucks.

However, like any instance of this case if that said player were to create a new account and not recreate the cases that brought the perma-ban upon them they are welcomed. I do still think they shouldn't get their account back, as it's a reminder of what can and will happen if they find themselves in that scenario again. It's great that you've made strides in the right direction! Think of cases like Incarnati0n and his past accounts.
