I updated my NVidia driver and it seemed to fix the issue, however now with v sync turned on, FPS varies between 58-62. When it drops bellow 60 it causes a weird stutter that I can't stand.\r\n\r\nWould anyone know what's going on and how to put it back to how it was?\r\n\r\nMy computer specs: I5 6500 3.2ghz, 8gb RAM, GTX 950 2gb, 1tb HHD","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-22T22:59:51.167+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The issue here might be due to a recent nvidia update that's causing shadowplay to act wonky.  To rule out this possibility, try disabling [Shadowplay ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xQMVVX7_30)for the fix.  Let me know if that helps!","replies":[]}]}
