Mobile hotspots aren't designed for online multiplayer gaming so it's likely to be a little iffy when playing League. Talking with your campus IT to see about getting some adjustments made for League specifically would be your best bet.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chermorg","date":"2017-11-13T21:55:25.419+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your ping on a mobile hotspot in the US is probably going to be too high to play League efficiently. I’d recommend contacting your school’s IT department - most schools don’t block video game ports (they know college students like their games after all), so maybe it’s a setting issue.","replies":[]}]}
