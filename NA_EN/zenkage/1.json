Even disabled my firewall temporarily while I tried logging in. \r\n\r\nAll I have tried seems to not effect this issue. In total I have (using the hextech tool) uninstalled and redownloaded the game three times this morning. \r\n\r\nHas anyone had this issue and fixed it in the past? Please help.

When exactly are you getting the error message, for example is it at a specific %?  Are you using an antivirus, and which one if so?  This issue could be with your permissions setting or connection, so a reinstall wouldn't really fix it.  If you have any other info or even screenshots let me know, so I can get a better idea of your specific case.  Let me know!","replies":[{"poster":"Zenkage","date":"2017-03-08T19:05:06.764+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Before this error started happening I had the updated client. I had a chance to change and got the error with the new client so I tried the old client. Both have the same message \"update failed\" click OK then asks to restart this repeats endlessly and although it said I finished the download to 100% I can see inbetween the restart button box popping up and going away over and over the download reading 33%. \nThe ani virus I use is webroot I tried disabling it and this made zero difference. I have a ticket up with my logs attached if that helps also","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-08T19:13:44.254+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is great, thanks for your information!  It sounds like you might have an unstable connection in this case that's missing pieces of your update and trying to backtrack.  If you're getting cut off or failing to catch up then you'll likely see that error.  For this case, go over each step of the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to make sure you're getting through.

I did notice your info on Webroot, but it seemed that you were passed that since you didn't receive a specific alert from the antivirus.  Thanks for the heads up on this!","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
