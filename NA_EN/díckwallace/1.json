The shield definitely has a sound, the same sound as before we did the update. However the player across the map never got the awesome chanting Shen did. SAYING that, we may add something in the future, no promises but I do not think that it is a bug right now.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Ranger XIV","date":"2016-02-22T19:06:09.693+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot Ranger XIV,realm=NA,application-id=LqLKtMpN,discussion-id=3rbsVBAT,comment-id=000200020000,timestamp=2016-02-22T19:04:32.031+0000)\n>\n> I see, I could be wrong but I do not believe that players received the chanting from Shen.
