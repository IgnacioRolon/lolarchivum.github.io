Just the window saying a match was in progress. I waited and eventually closed the game and tried to retry. After forever it finally opened, but then froze. I closed it again only to go to the end game screen where it said remake due to me being a leaver. It wasn't even my fault?? Is there anyway i can prevent this from happening again? Seems stupid I get penalized for something I couldn't even control.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-03-20T20:19:38.538+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"After champion select ends and you go into the champion loading screen, your network needs to make a new connection to the actual game servers.
