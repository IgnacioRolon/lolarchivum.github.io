Why does sucky matchmaking put him in my team!\" to \"hey, this website lists this person that was once banned for flaming got put in my team.  why does sucky matchmaking put him in my team; matchmake him with other flamers instead!\" (the player might not have said a single word yet at the time the person checked his teammates and opponents on some website...)  ;-(        I guess seeing the list of bans and reasons at the start of a match might be good for teamwork if there are exactly zero for any of the 5 teammates, but if it's non-zero for any of them, it could drop teamwork way below what it would be if that info _is not available_.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"KnKitsune","date":"2019-08-23T02:59:58.204+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Bazerka,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=ETlEBRfU,comment-id=000000050000,timestamp=2019-08-21T23:34:11.180+0000)\n>\n> If you were reported and banned, would you want your records of why publicly posted with names, instances, etc? The hit to player trust far outweighs the gain of satisfying a players immediate sense of \"karma\". However, I'll acknowledge karma feels good sometimes.\n\nKarma? I call it justice. Better to ensure players that the system is actually working right and maintain THEIR trust than the feelings of a toxic inter/troll.\n\nMy trust in it is thin enough when Rito allows a duo go on a month long trolling/inting spree with 250 ranked matches.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Choochle","date":"2019-08-19T20:27:17.485+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"Will do, just don't want him to ruin others experiences in the game.
