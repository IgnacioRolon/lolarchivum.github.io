I love League. A lot of the direction changes I agree with 90% of the time. I have played her roughly 15+ games since her rework, trying to figure her out and prove to myself that I'm wrong about the problem with Sona. I am still searching, but I seriously still feel she's one of bottom tier supports and relies on your team mates to not be dumb. It's more miss than hit and doesn't help when your ADC is clueless about the strengths and weaknesses of your kit. \n\nHowever, after receiving this Sona Survey by you in-game, all I can feel is more irritated. Irritated that you loaded the question instead of separately ask which parts I absolutely detest about it. Why? Because the art direction did an amazing job on her and that's doing them an injustice when I click the \"Disagree\" button. I wanted to click \"strongly disagree\" but due to this aspect and general direction for Sona (STILL NEEDS HEAVY WORK) is a good idea, I cannot loathe it as much as I want to express in your survey.\n\nSo next time, break the survey into more than just one question because this is really misleading and I take it no one has taken a crash course on psychology 101 when it comes to surveys being misleading when you word it a certain way. In this case, loading the question.\n\nPS: This isn't a Sona QQ thread, we have enough of them.","replies":[{"poster":"davin","date":"2014-08-01T00:45:55.469+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":4,"body":"This little question is part of a broader investigation that happens on each release. For each release, a few different questions are seeded via this tool (gameplay, visuals, etc.). Those questions are sent via the Microfeedback Tool (MFT), which is a super simple one-Likert statement thing. For this Sona update there's 6 total questions in the MFT--a visual one, a gameplay one, and a general one. All sent to two different populations (people who just played Sona and people who are in a random sample).\n\nFor any given release, those MFT data join the broader set data: lab data (we run usability/playability/etc. labs), \"traditional\" survey data (the larger web-based surveys we send out), analytics (analysis of in-game performance), etc.\n\nSorry that this question didn't provide you enough space to air your thoughts. We keep the MFT really brief and light so that it doesn't get annoying (since we pop it up). The more traditional surveys are much more in-depth, since they aren't interruptive. If you do want to share more about how you feel, the forum here is a good place or you can use things like the 'Help us Improve' survey. \n\nHope that helps shed some light on why we'd use something so narrow. The TL;DR is it's part of a broader constellation of things, and we really don't want any of our research to get annoying or bothersome, so the MFT keeps it brief.","replies":[{"poster":"ratcharmer","date":"2014-08-01T02:42:53.488+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"> If you do want to share more about how you feel, the forum here is a good place or you can use things like the **'Help us Improve' survey**.\n\nWhere does one find this?","replies":[{"poster":"davin","date":"2014-08-01T04:19:11.795+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"> > If you do want to share more about how you feel, the forum here is a good place or you can use things like the **'Help us Improve' survey**.\n> \n> Where does one find this?\n\nThere's a link at the bottom of the landing page of the client (after you log in).

Since all of these stats have been removed and since the radius on Sona's auras has been cut into about one third of what they were what is the justification for lowering her base health and only giving her 3 more armor. Additionally why would you increase her base armor by 3 and then subsequently lower her base health, this seems contradictory and baffling. Furthermore why should Sona be squishy-er or as squishy as zyra a mage who has far superior CC and damage and extreme range( On a side note I think zyra is too squishy). As a support who is expected to be in the frontlines and who has lost a lot of her passive stats through constant nerfing and changing of passive stat items why aren't Sona's passive stats buffed in compensation? Why doesn't Sona gain any magic resist per level? Why does Sona have one of the lowest if not the lowest base health in the game, if this is to compensate for her power can you please explain to me how her healing is better than nami's or how her shields are better than Janna's or how her damage is better than thresh's? Because there is not a single category where she offers superior utility than other supports. She also has one of the lowest base armors in the game even with the 3 armor buff, and her health at lvl 18 is something like 1600 without items. That's after the scaling health buff.  My numbers might  be slightly off because I'm doing this off the top of my head but they are generally in the right area. With those resists and health lategame you can literally be hit twice by an adc in the span of about 1 second and ignited by someone else and you will die. Since her auras encourage her to build AP to make them useful how is she supposed to afford tank items or have the slots for them or even afford big AP or tank items  since frost queens gp/10 was nerfed and nomad's GP 10 and gold will usually only pay off the cost of the item itself if that?\n\nI don't expect an answer, because I don't think there is one, but thank you for your time.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Sotere","date":"2014-08-02T19:23:23.867+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":10,"body":"Throughout testing we came to recognize that Sona's early game weakness to burst had been dampened by the shield from Aria of Perseverance (W).  We want her playstyle to have meaningful choice, and early game that means she has to be at risk if she wants to use her poke.  We will continue to watch her to make sure she isn't getting blown up too often.  Fearless is of course keeping a close eye on this, as is everyone else on his team.  \n\nSona has always been squishy. She is not the squishiest in the game, though. Many ranged supports share her level of durability.  As for her ability to provide superior utility: I think she will be top tier for mobility in the later game, and one of the best at taking objectives and sieging thanks to being able to apply multiple shields on allies and give substantial damage boosts when she uses Q.  Crescendo has always been, and remains, an excellent team fight tool.","replies":[{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2014-08-02T19:48:41.539+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"W is completely useless in a burst situation, though?

I'm finding more success just maxing W first and becoming a healbot, and good lord that is boring and not what I played Sona for.\n\nShe doesn't have much mobility, a speed up can be easily stunned and she can't go through walls. She can give ridiculous amounts of movespeed, but that requires her team to be standing right on top of her, and that's more coordination than would probably happen in solo queue.

But her level 1 was hit the hardest. Taking Q first means certain death if you try to poke and the opponents are quick to react.\n\nThat and the risk of poking is absolutely not worth the reward right now. With the nerfed powerchord damage, unless the opponent's already at lower health and you can guarantee a kill with the poke (...that's not very pokey), it just isn't worth risking getting caught and feeding a kill.\n\nRanged supports which share her level of durability also have hard CC to compensate for their weakness. Sona is not able, in any way before level 6, to stop an opponent from closing in. Zyra, who is extremely squishy as well, has a long range line snare available to her level 1, if she needs it. Even Soraka, who is also bottom of the barrel right now, has a silence - so while she can't stop auto attacks she can at least stop a skill combo if she times her E correctly. Sona has nothing, just an extremely weak shield/heal (compare with Karma's shield+potential to poke safely).\n\nBasically, if I want to set up kills, I'm going to bring someone like Thresh or Leona. If I want sustain, I'm bringing Nami (who also has a very strong engage/disengage tool in her ult plus poke and hard CC). If I want poke, I'm better off with someone like Zyra or Karma who can do so from a much safer distance.\n\nI do agree though that she is right now top tier late game for utility in general. The Q boosts are useless for sieging since they don't work on structures, but they're useful for dragon/baron and skirmishes. However, Sona was already good at these things before. She already gave every ally buffs, although they were largely invisible before. The greatly increased risks in early game haven't been worth it so far with how dependent on AP she is to scale properly for late game, imo.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Sotere","date":"2014-08-02T21:25:11.377+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":9,"body":"I feel like you might be cherry picking a bit with your Zyra and Soraka examples. Zyra does potentially have hard CC at level one. If she does level that, her poke is trivial.  She normally opts into level 1 Q, level 2 W.  She has her range to protect her early levels, but not much else.  \n\nSoraka's E is a pretty weak response to aggression. It only delays spells but they're most likely still going to be used in the course of a trade. Sona does have access to Diminuendo and Tempo pre-6, both of which can slow down aggression arguably better than a silence.  \n\nI haven't had issues with level 1 aggression because minions provide pretty good protection and most laners don't have fatal burst until they get access to some of their other spells.  That said, the level of early risk is something we have on our radar.  If she is consistently failing in early trades, we can address that.","replies":[{"poster":"XXnIE66Rui","date":"2014-08-02T23:29:20.554+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Zyra has a clear choice between safe poke at level 1 or hard CC to stop an engage (situational). Sona has neither. Her poke is much riskier and her CC much less effective. I don't see how that's cherry-picking when Zyra is very obviously superior in terms of safety in spite of being notoriously squishy too.\n\nSoraka is more cherry picky, I agree. Although being marginally better than bottom of the barrel supports isn't something to brag about, unfortunately.\n\nDiminuendo and Tempo both require being in AA range and neither prevent a reaction, both require the passive to be up, and are only able to slow down aggression, not stop it (and still put Sona in a position to be snared and finished off). No other support suffers from this kind of restriction to access their potential CC. I honestly do not see Sona's current iteration as better than Soraka in lane, and Soraka's weak laning is a big reason why she's forgotten as a support.\n\nAll of that aside, there is still virtually no reason to bring Sona over any other support (in lane). There are better pokers, there are better healers, there are better supports to set up kills, and while her ult *is* powerful, so is Nami's, so is Thresh's, so is Leona's, so is Zyra's, so is Braum's, so is Morgana's, and they all can ult more safely than she can.\n\nSona is literally the only support in the game right now who needs to take that kind of risk to be able to do more than just be a heal bot.

Plus if your going for a weak in lane awesome lategame support Janna has her outclassed. With Braum's nerfs he's also weak in lane but strong in lategame. He also has her outclassed.

I'm not a long-time player, but she was the first champion to catch my attention. I never played much of her (always because she felt like a weak pick compared to other supports and largely because I don't actually PvP much, though I did play a lot of ARAM with old Sona), but I own her, and when my account was new (BR account) I went on a mystery skin purchase spree, specifically, in hopes of getting all of her skins (which I did and was ecstatic about).\n\nWhen I heard she was getting a rework I was really excited in hopes this would make her viable and I would be able to pick her in SR without feeling like a burden, the few times I actually play PvP. I tried her out multiple times against bots and I can safely say I would not feel comfortable bringing her into PvP. As a reasonably new player I still make a lot of mistakes and it feels to me like playing Sona would be a lot more punishing for me if I made those mistakes.\n\nSo when I discuss this rework it's because I really, really want to feel safe and comfortable playing Sona. Of course nobody's going to balance a champion around any individual person, I just really want to like her, this rework is important to me, and therefore I want it to be the best it can be even if it means I end up not liking it. Maybe I'll just never be a very good Sona and that's just a thing I need to accept.\n\n(In comparison, I always really liked Nami, and when she started being used consistently in the competitive scene that made me really happy. I also suck at assassins, but I love seeing them in play. Voyboy used Talon today in the LCS and that was one of the most exciting things to happen all week! That sort of thing.)\n\nSo really, thanks for reading what we have to say, and for replying to it. I promise I give feedback in an attempt to be useful, rather than offend or point fingers.

The shield's uptime is too short for that, among other things.\n\nI don't feel the power of the heal or the shield reflect this tradeoff, how it can rarely be used to full power (which would require incoming damage as often as its up, and no faster or slower). I think that it should just apply a secondary heal on aura, or that half the remaining shield should go to health, or something, so the two use cases don't feel as wasteful. (And frankly, it does feel weak overall anyways atm).\n\nThe bigger issue though is probably that E remains a one-point wonder, the same spot it has been in since forever. Ranking it up basically does nothing at all for it, and the first level is so lacking in impact that the only reason anyone would even get it pre-9 is for the power chord slow. I feel that when a skill is so weak that skipping it entirely is an option, there's a real problem. Sona's E is currently that weak. At 200+ AP I still only just notice the boost to allies. Sona is finally moving decently at that point, but the cooldown is kind of absurd for how weak it is overall so I can't even maintain it at max CDR (compared to old E, which was no more potent but at least had 100% uptime).","replies":[{"poster":"Pika310","date":"2014-08-03T01:50:06.594+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had the same thought on Aria myself.

It also takes a bit to get to level 2 in a duo lane, so I need to use a pot too in order to make sure I don't die the next time the enemy gets hungry for first blood.

You don't want a support that's bad at the early game. That is contrary to the entire purpose of a support. They're supposed to babysit the marksman until late game, where they provide peel and utility.

Because she provides exceptional late game utility.\n\nwell, it's not like the tanky support has the only level one gold support item who provide help to the carry and boost stat and gold for the support\n\nMaybe giving a complementarity bonus to the 2 other gold item will be a good idea for balancing bot lane","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Fisk","date":"2014-08-01T04:14:26.441+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":5,"body":"I dunno bout this... I played sona today quite extensively and found the rework to be pretty damn strong. Her poke is weaker and relies on her stacking up power chord and hitting a Q+power cord combo. But now you just max W and she will just wreck lane. I mean she will seriously be unkillable. She will hang out at full health and give a 200 health shield and an even bigger heal to you and your ADC. Just because her Q isn't and instant 0 health enemy duo doesn't mean she's weak.","replies":[{"poster":"Kynami","date":"2014-08-01T04:58:26.194+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sona's good combo has *always* been AA-Q-AA+Chord. Thing is damage wise its taken a hit. We will keep the comparison simple and just say she has 100 AP.\n\nOld Q version - 50/100/150/200/250 and 4/8/12/16/20 AD+AP\n\nNew version - 40/80/120/160/200 and 40/50/60/70/80 (10/20/30) damage on next auto\n\nLevel 9 at five ranks and one point in the ult for an AA-Q-AA+Chord combo with Q also being previous aura used:\nOld: (74 + 20) + (250 + 60) + (74 + 20 + 212) = 710\nNew: (74) + (200 + 50) + (74 + 115 + 153) = 666\n\nThat is a 44 damage difference, additionally their ADC got the benefit of the extra 20 damage on every auto and 20 AD/AP added to every ability. If we make the AP for both versions of Sona be 200 the difference is 54 points of damage difference for 1v1. The trend reverses at 400 AP to be a 24 point difference, though at that much AP you're probably level 16+ and have the other two ult ranks making the damage potential essentially even.\n\nGood luck getting that much AP on a support budget though. And with the early game nerfs, good luck taking her mid. Her new Q only provides improved burst damage when used on multiple (as in at least her and two more) allies at 200+ AP. Sustained damage for everyone on her team in a team fight is down though.\n\nShe isn't unkillable, she has a 1.5 second shield on a minimum 6 second cooldown. And the heal is heavily dependent on missing HP% (As in it only reaches full double effectiveness when the target is already dead!) Not to mention a 200 point shield requires minimum of 250 AP and level 16. Which for a support build only occurs at 5+ items.","replies":[{"poster":"Fisk","date":"2014-08-01T16:43:26.797+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"They removed power from her poke. That is true. About that tho. ONE person has to auto attack (this person can be her mind you) an enemy to be more damage than she was before. Second her W is what you max and even if they are missing 30 percent health that is a MASSIVE heal. Third late game her shield will block probably 2000 damage if you use it correctly in a team fight and you have max cdr.  That is enormous. She is very strong right now. Just because she lost a bit of damage doesn't mean shes bad. Also her E got a massive buff which is big. She is much more meaningful now IMO and tank sona is better if anything you just need to not be counting on the fact that shes gonna one shot their squishy champ (even though she really still can if you Q+powerchord with a lich bane)","replies":[{"poster":"Kynami","date":"2014-08-01T19:24:13.759+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"E ate a nerf. Additional three seconds downtime even at max CDR. Loss of the 20 MS passive that persisted even after the 1.5 second speed boost. The fact even with the new boost it rapidly declines from the personal boost to the party provided boost. And outside of situations where you are hitting at least two others every time with the auras her power was diminished. Among other things she can no longer speed boost minion waves. But basically math wise: 335 base movement ally + 45 MS T2 boots + 20 MS aura passive +18% speed boost (250 AP) = 472 before speed cap adjustments. 335 base move +45 MS T2 boots + 24% MS speed boost = 471 before the soft speed cap adjustments.\n\nQ only provides a burst damage boost against non-static enemies with auto-attacks, and again for it to actually be a net benefit you need at least three people. The old version applied to every ally within range enhancing auto-attacks and abilities and even worked against structures. And additionally the old version lasted past the first hit in all-ins.\n\nThe shield is only 200 points worth of damage mitigation per cast per ally at a minimum of 250 AP. There is literally only a couple builds I've been able to put together that result in an actually tanky Sona that can get that level of AP. And to reach it requires a blue elixir to cap CDR and get the last chunk of AP.\n\nAbout that W... its only more efficient at over three ranks. And rushing W gives up Q, which gives up lane presence and Sona's only form of wave clear (which is still pitiful even with maxed Q). The mana cost is higher, the cooldown is higher, and with the loss of the resistances and the HP cut that doesn't go even until 4th Sona has it even worse the first four levels of laning. And to reach 2000 points of shielding in a team fight requires hitting every single ally champion you have with at least two casts at full build, which I'm afraid against any competent opposition is going to result in you being clumped up enough for a wombo combo with their considerably better damage scaling.","replies":[{"poster":"Fisk","date":"2014-08-01T23:02:09.681+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"The amount of power in team fight re-positioning her e just got is far strong then something that just sorta helps you get around slightly faster. Q still is strong in a 2v2 bot lane fight. Late game if you have roughly 200 ap from items the shield will get close enough to two hundred and is still large enough if you have no ap to be meaningful. A 5 man shield is incredibly powerful.  Also rushing W is just much stronger. You sacrifice your damage but it doesn't really matter because your sustain and damage mitigation from it is much better. Also her base stats got higher which makes a huge difference. Also if you use your E correctly hitting multiple man shields around objectives isn't hard. You can argue about her rework all you want and sona may even see a tiny buff but right now she's 100% viable and even pretty strong. Go look at the featured games being played right now shes probably in one of them. I have played a lot of support games and a decent amount of sona for the three seasons I've been playing. I have a pretty good understanding on how this game works and I'm just telling you now she's in a good spot.
