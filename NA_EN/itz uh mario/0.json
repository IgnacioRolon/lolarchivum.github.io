Not only were they a perfect duo that always bounced off of each other, but they also gave the most interesting content; lore, exciting play-calling, heads up shout-casting and beyond all else, perfect synchronization, even when they had to kill time for over an hour and a half due to OGN&#039;s problems last season. \n\nI know of the politics between a caster (a low paid employee) and a billion dollar corporation, but get over it. The new casters are horrible, SPOTV (though unavoidable at this point) is horrible, and it&#039;s only going to continue to create turmoil with the professional scene all year long.\n\nI hope there are some on here who can agree with me, because I truly miss my nights with Monte and DoA, bringing intelligent, personable and top notch shout-casting.\n\nOn a side note, if there is a better shout-casting duo, let me know. I haven&#039;t found one yet. Given I only speak English and Spanish.\n\nAll in all, is anyone in agreement that Monte and DoA should be cornerstones of the LCK scene?\n\nEdit: LCK1 is down to 448 viewers... The lowest I've ever seen it by at least 4,000, and that was for bottom of the table teams.\n\nEdit: The viewership on Twitch is back up to normal levels, but the amount of complaints with LS being casted over MonteCristo and DoA is flooding chat.","replies":[{"poster":"Quavelix","date":"2017-01-17T08:51:02.057+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"This stream is unwatchable with LS and whoever the other guy is.\n\nAs a compromise I'm forced to sit there with the sound muted.

They are both freelance casters - they dont work for SPOTV or Riot. They go to the highest bidder and the ones they think with further their career, which at the moment is OGN. And the problem has nothing to do with SPOTV and Monte/DoA, since Monte/DoA never worked for SPOTV. SPOTV had pretty much always had mediocre/terrible broadcasting for League. In SC2 ProLeague, it was the opposite - SPOTV had the better cast and the OGN had a terrible broadcast. \n\nBut without going into all the problems of 2 gigantic broadcasting organizations competing for the rights to broadcast the LCK, Monte and DoA still work for the OGN. It just looks like they switched to casting Overwatch. It might be because Overwatch is growing, it might be because OGN's hold on the LCK is shrinking.

I dont think he has to \"work\" to synergize with anyone, since his casting style is mainly joking/comedic relief (which cannot be said of the Krepo/Froskurinn duo when they kept trying to talk over each other). He has casted games with Phreak and others, and it seems like his personality is just relaxed, talkative, and very easy to pair with.

He is special with Monte, but if Monte goes and he follows with him it won't be a so big loss","replies":[]},{"poster":"Stillname","date":"2017-01-19T03:32:28.140+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I completely agree that Monte is an entertaining caster. He always keeps the games fun but is also a different type of caster than most of the LCS casters. He is a pretty charismatic guy but doesn't get overly excited about teamfights unless there is something happening to get hyped about which is something the LCS casters could do a little better imo.\n\nHowever, I would never say that he is the game knowledge guy. He is master of hindsight and saying exactly what went wrong with any given decision but he just isn't the guy to go to when talking about what a teams strategy will be for that game.\n\nI am not trying to bash on the guy because he is a great caster but he definitely has his flaws and I think the big one is that he simply just doesn't play league so the only strategies he can ever know about are ones in games that he watches.\n\nI would say a caster like Krepo would be more of the \"game knowledge\" type of caster because he has so much experience in and around the game but he is a way worse at presenting the information in an exciting and fluid way than Monte is.","replies":[]},{"poster":"iTz Uh Mario","date":"2017-01-18T11:08:02.544+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"This.

Riot controls the profits of their own, in-house casters that they use in both the EU and NA LCS, but I'm pretty sure Monte doesnt get paid by (what he believes to be) Riot's low compensation.
