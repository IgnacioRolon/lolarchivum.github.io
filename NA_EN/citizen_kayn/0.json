I asked you \"what should I do then when I'm having a troll premades in my team\". \r\nYou said: \"Mute them and keep cool\". I did.... I wasted 40 minutes of my time.  What 3 of us + enemy team did? Report them. \r\n\r\nEffect -> nothing. \r\n\r\nThanks guys for such wonderful system where for saying \"sell skin\" or \"useless jg\" you are getting a permaban, meanwhile for trolling the game you get nothing.\r\n\r\nSo let's just sum up, what tool do people have against trolls in their team? Ummmmm? Can they kick out a player and replace him with bot the way it's done in HotS? No? Okay, so maybe what about the report? Lots of people reported them from both teams, they are having 1/14 and build that is obviously a troll build. They must have got at least honor decrease for sure.... nope. \r\n\r\nFunniest part is that they didn't want to surr so we had to play whole game although we knew it's lost, their Irelia was 31 kills, full build and could solo penta. We couldn't go afk cuz we would get an extended queue. I told the guys that they are getting reported. After he added me to friends list and laughed at me. No bans, no warring, nothing.\r\n\r\n..Removed by Moderation..\r\n\r\nRunning solo into 5 suiciding is totally not trolling but having a bad game xD\r\n\r\nI'm creating this post because each time we are having an argument about that, you always say the same thing all over again, ALWAYS! \r\n\r\n\"mAyBe ThEy HAD a bAD gAMe!!@\"\r\n\r\n..Removed by Moderation..\r\n\r\nTrolling exists and Riot does very little to help people fight it. \r\n\r\nBut I guess it is fair to permaban people for saying \"useless yasuo 0/10\" although you can always mute them, but it is not fair to ban people for trolling because \"mAyBe ThEy HAD a bAD gAMe!!@\". You have no right to have a comment on your teammate's performance in the game, but you are entitled to throw a game and laugh because who cares... you just had a bad game. When someone is having a 0/10 yasuo and tells him that he should not play him anymore in a chat, that person is totally not having a bad game.  \r\n\r\n\r\nAt the end a fine example of your social justice: https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/KYUeQk5E-thank-you-for-the-memories-riot-games-im-sorry-i-couldnt-improve-and-be-less-toxic-please-read\r\n\r\nThis guy totally deserved it. I feel straight away safer knowing that you banned such horrible person. Thank you rito, for your service now I know that whenever I'm suiciding into enemy team and throwing the match....

Even one of those examples would be suitable to prove you wrong, but points are seldom proven on one example - nevermind _zero_.\n\n> So let's just sum up, what tool do people have against trolls in their team?\n\nThe post-game report feature and Support Tickets. They aren't immediately satisfying, but they're the tools that you have at your disposal.\n\n> Can they kick out a player and replace him with bot the way it's done in HotS?\n\nThe ability to kick players from a match-in-progress in League is a topic that's been done to death, and the consensus is that it could _very_ easily be abused by premades and would cull off-meta strategies and people who, for whatever reason, happen to underperform in any given match.\n\nBesides, a bot would do you no better than a troll in a PVP match. Don't ask for something you don't actually want.\n\n> Okay, so maybe what about the report?\n>\n> ...\n>\n> They must have got at least honor decrease for sure.... nope.\n\nHow in the world do you know whether or not someone had an Honor decrease? Are you breaking into Riot's servers and extracting information you're not supposed to have? Or are you just throwing out assumptions in the hopes that it'll suffice as an argument?\n\n> ..Removed  by Moderation..\n\nMocking players for withholding judgement for lack of reliable information doesn't serve to reinforce your point. By default, we tend to err on the possibility that a player had a bad game _because people are known to be petty jerks who'll try to pen the blame on someone else and vilify them in any way they can_ - and in League, that typically involves painting someone as a troll so they can act like someone went out of their way to ruin their game, when in fact they just got outskilled and had their ass thoroughly handed to them.\n\n> I'm creating this post because each time we are having an argument about that, you always say the same thing all over again, ALWAYS!\n\nAnd this post only furthers the stereotype that we try to avoid validating by saying that. Yes, you may well have run into a troll, but is anybody going to give a damn if you start slinging mud because people don't immediately assume foul play on every low score?\n\nFrankly, I wouldn't. The moment you start pulling that derisive alternating caps case, you lose any vestige of good faith in your post.\n\n> ..Removed by Moderation..\n\nAren't boots unique, unstackable items now, or am I just conflating the Tear-stack change a while ago with being only able to buy one boots item?\n\nRegardless, obvious cases of trolling tend to get punished faster. Building useless/detrimental items is pretty easy to notice, which, to my knowledge, is why it's not seen all that often.\n\n> Trolling exists and Riot does very little to help people fight it.\n\nThe fight against trolls is a war on two fronts - and, whether you believe it or not, Riot _is_ doing their damnedest on their end. The other end belongs to us players, and frankly, the community does a poor job of it. Crying \"wolf\" over pugs, and raising arguments over how trolls are dealt with and how we should respond to them - like right now, even - doesn't help Riot catch trolls any faster.\n\nI have to wonder why people take that stretch of logic, where having difficulty doing something equates to not actually doing it. Have I ever actually played Dark Souls, then, given how difficult of a game it is? Did I really actually beat For Honor on Realistic difficulty, or, did it not actually happen because it was difficult?\n\nI will never understand that line of thinking.\n\n> But I guess it is fair to permaban people for saying \"useless yasuo 0/10\"...\n\nIf they just got off of a 14-day ban and continue to belligerently harass their teammates, it's absolutely more than fair that they get permabanned.\n\n> ...although you can always mute them...\n\nHaving a mitigation tool does not change that the misbehavior being mitigated is, say it with me now, **_against the rules you agreed to upon creating an account to begin with._**\n\n> ...but it is not fair to ban people for trolling because \"maybe they had a bad game\".\n\nIf there is the possibility that they didn't intend to play poorly, if it cannot be proven without a shadow of a doubt that they intended to sabotage the game, then Riot must stay their hand.\n\n_Intent_ is the operative factor in gameplay-related punishments, not score, not builds; _**intent**_. The other factors may contribute to figuring out the intent, but they are not in and of themselves concrete evidence of misbehavior.\n\n> ...now I know that whenever I'm suiciding into enemy team and throwing the match....

People can opt out of Ally chat. So a toxic person can remove their own chat. This isn't going to stop most though I reckon. Because they feel the need to blame someone, even if that person isn't a troll.\n\n> \n> 2. Make toxic people queue with other toxic people only. Toxic people have no problem with toxicity of others therefore let's just put them all on a separate \"island\". Happy days. And if someone who played with toxic players only for a long time but haven't been toxic, he gets promoted to play with non-toxic people. Toxicity problem **solved**.\n\nBull fucking shit. We see various posts of \"Waahahhh I was only toxic because they were toxic! Unfair!\" And surprise surprise, they said they reported the player they retaliatrd against. So effectively you are putting people who do clearly have a problem with toxicity with toxicity. Which is why Riot has stated before to be against Prisoner's Island.\n\n> \n> \n> And what are we having now? A system that bans you for nothing (but is not effective against trolls) and makes you have another account. What would you do if you were toxic and got banned? You would probably make another account.... and be toxic again. \n\nNo doubt someone will check my history so I'll be upfront right now. Yes, I have been mainly playing TFT and ARAM recently as not in the mood for SR. In ARAM and SR I have done, I hardly see any trolling. Just yesterday had a Cait on my team get harassed by two accusing her of inting/trolling. Guess who blocked the surrender vote, spoiler, not the Cait. The people harassing her blocked it. Fairly certain wasn't the last person since they didn't like the changes Riot made to their champ.\n\nThe system needs to be improved for troll handling, yes. What would help is if people stopped fucking reporting for \"trolling\" for the smallest thing. Yes, I question the viability of the Teemo in this example. I could see potential for a Lethality Teemo with his stealth mechanic. I could see less potential in a healerish build with whatever the green rune that allows healing with slows. \n\n> \n> I swear to God, they came up with the most idiotic solution to the problem there could ever be. In such system the toxic players are not gotten rid of, they are just recycled but this time even more frustrated because their main acc got banned. \n\nDepends on the player.

Everyone are loving it. It's **always** better to have a decent bot rather than a troll. \n\nExcept these are LoL bots we're talking about, that wouldnt work unfortunately. AI in this game is dumb as shit tbh.\n\n> - No one really knows what is the function of honor. Trolling does not affect it and toxic people are getting their honor blocked/ban straight away, no decrease mid-way.\n\nMy problem with honor is that it doesnt affect the quality of the match. I can be goody two-shoes or reincarnation of Adolf H., it doesnt matter, quality of my games wont change....to be more precise, i dont feel rewarded for enduring negative behaviour while being sportsmanlike player.\nBut thats because I dont have a shit about cosmetics.\n\n> - Millions, literally millions of times this idea was proposed.

People need to learn how to shrug off toxicity. Hell, if I was able to laught my ass off at death threats and detailed description of how will some1 rape and kill my mother at the age of 14 (on other games, but the similar things were happening when I started to play back in s3), then older teens and adults should be able aswell.\n\n> 2.

So for example\nlvl 5-4 --> highest quality of games behaviour-wise\nlvl 3-2 --> slightly worse\nlvl 1-0 --> you get to play exclusively with the worst kind of players\n\n> And what are we having now?

You can't play games with ban, therefore he got no ban. Now the question is, did he made more harm with trolling or maybe someone that flames that you can mute does more harm? For me option number one. Trolling is trolling. It's destroying the game and players can't do nothing about it, therefore it should be banable. \n\nYou can always remove a chat in a game entirely (pings are more than enough if you want to communicate in a game, high elo games are proving this, where no chat is used by players). No chat means no flame. You can always put flamers in a separate queue (prison island idea) where flamers play only with flamers and everyone are happy, but you can't do anything with trolls.... Can I \"mute\" troll so he stops trolling.... well no. Can I kick him and get a decent bot in his place that obviously is not as good as a real player but at least he doesn't troll.... well not really. \n \nSo what can I do? I can report him and write a big ass long comment proving his fault (mejais + duskblade + 1/14 on teemo is more than enough). A riot employee will read this comment in depth and.... wipe his ass with it. Next day the guy plays nunu support with mobility boots, yommus and 0/10 stats... but I guess he just had a bad game. Am I right? \n\n\n> Besides, a bot would do you no better than a troll in a PVP match.\n\nI'd argue with that. When I say \"troll\" I mean a nunu that is running around the map with the snowball that suicides under turrets. A bot would at least build right items and use some skill from time to time. If 4 premades kick a normal player and replace him with a bot... well that's their problem. I don't want to struggle for 40 minutes because my trolling premades don't want to surr and enemy team does so well in the game that they don't want to finish.... I'd say I take a bot, and although the bot is not perfect it will heal you from time to time with that soraka instead of dancing in a dragon pit whole game. You know what I mean? \n\n\n> How in the world do you know whether or not someone had an Honor decrease?\n\nAs I said the guy added me to friends list and told me after I told him he's getting a ban for that and that we will rep him. The enemy team told us they will rep him as well. End of a match, he adds me to friends lists and tells me that he didn't even got a honor decrease. That's what pushed me to create this topic. \n\n\n> Mocking rujitra for withholding judgement for lack of reliable information doesn't serve to reinforce your point\n\nWhat you mean \"reliable information\", see the screenshot there. Look at teemos build and stats... like what more evidence am I required to supply?? I'm the jerk here because I dared to say that teemo is trolling and \"maybe he had a bad game\".... What other type of game could he have if he builds mikaels and duskblade on teemo??? Like seriously, why am I the evil one here, why am I the evil one, because I think tha trolling is not okay, and that trolling does more damage to the game than saying that someone is useless because he is in fact useless?? \nI mock rujitra because he **ALWAYS** says that, NO MATTER OF WHAT EVIDENCE I SHOW HIM. Well maybe it's time to realize that in fact people are not always having a bad game and they just troll. But I guess I should be punished here, because I dared to make that post, please ban me immediately because I offended feelings of every teemo player in the game that sucks and builds some trolling stuff.... wait, I didn't meant toll build, I meant \"a build that usually is highly connected with experiencing a bad game\". What I was having there is not a bad game? That teemo and lucian were not having a bad game, they were having a laugh. Me and the 2 normal people in my team were having a bad game, but we are risking now a ban because you are not allowed to feel mad at troll.... It's not a big deal, just 40 minutes wasted and effort, meanwhile he was having a good time running around map and trolling.  \n\n> Frankly, I wouldn't. The moment you start pulling that derisive alternating caps case, you lose any vestige of good faith in your post.\n\nObviously. I use caps to highlight things that hurt me but yeah... let's not see the facts I supplied there. Let's ignore the screenshot, THE GUY USED CAPS SO HE MUST BE WRONG xD Oh, wait... did I use it again? I don't know what about you guys, but when I read someones complaint I focus on arguments for most of the time, no matter of minuses or the sound of the text and I do not intend to change anything, just because the boards masses might not like the sound of it. ..Removed by Moderation.. I'm saying that just so you know that I do not intend to beg you on my knees for some attention, I'm here to highlight something. If you want to discuss with me you have to know that I'm open for discussion, but I mean a real discussion, not \"adjusting\" myself to your current policy only because Periscope might come and ban me. \n\n> Aren't boots unique, unstackable items now\n\nThis was me referring to a stereotypical troll. It's almost iconic that they build 5 mobility boots. I didn't meant an actually guy that I met in a game few days ago, it was a rhetorical figure to kinda focus you to thinking that being bad at the game is not always just being bad at the game. Building 5 mobility boots (although its not possible anymore) is **not** an example of having a bad game in this case, because building 5 mobility boots is not connected with your laning abilities. Like seriously, do I really have to explain this in depth? I was thinking that you guys got the idea. \n\n> the community does a poor job of it\n\nAlright. I accept your line here. How can I help? How can community help? \nIt would be nice if you would inform us (community) what to do in order to help you, so far I haven't seen any message form you to tell me what to do to help you catch the trolls faster. I would be glad to do that. \nOn the other hand I've seen community proposing their solutions millions of times, here are two I like most: \n- Bring back tribunal (now community can help you to deal with trolls and others) \n- Make honor decrease when a player plays bad for multiple games(bad game and trolling). That way if you had multiple 0/10 games, you honor will decrease and become a reason for you to get better (maybe watch some yt videos how to get better, or maybe next time focus on the game instead of playing effortlessly, so your team doesn't have to deal with 10/0    5 minutes into game Darius and flame you). Seems fair to me. \n\n..Removed  by Moderation..\n\nWell if they had a bad game.... multiple times in a row (meaning their team lost because of them) that means that they do not contribute enough and lol is a team game from what I can remember, everyone should try their best. Running around map with 1/14 teemo with mikaels and duskblade is not not trying your best.   \n\n> If they just got off of a 14-day ban and continue to belligerently harass their teammates, it's absolutely more than fair that they get permabanned.\n\nIt is not. Saying to 0/10 Yasuo that he is a \"0/10 yasuo\" is not a harass, it is stating of a fact! Sorry, but I don't think that people should get punished for saying the truth, although it might be unpleasant. Flame should never be permabanable because flamers can **ALWAYS** be muted. Also as I said flamers can have no access to chat (no chat no flame) and they can be always queued with other flamers. **That is not the case with trolls**. Trolls cannot be \"muted\" so they are not trolling, trolls cannot be kicked and replaced with bot because you don't like the idea, trolls are (in your view)  hard to determine, therefore they usually get away with their dirty habit. \n\nYou can flame but still win the game and cooperate well, flame is caused by strong emotions usually because you are the one who carries and you realize that if you make a mistake - you lose. This makes players being highly annoyed by players that throw the game intentionally, because this destroys all of their efforts. If you would build a caste out of cards for hours, how would you feel if I would run destroy it without caring much? Would you feel happy? \n\nPunishing people because they try their best is not optimal behavior for a game company  in my view. And as I said if you don't like what they say you can always mute them or take their chat access away from them. \n\nTrolling is something totally different. People don't flame because they feel pleasure from it, they usually flame because they feel grief and their emotions are trying to escape. Trolls troll because they feel pleasure in destroying someone's game. They are much worse, because normal people flame from time to time (you did flame as well, don't lie), people tend to get mad at their teammates and this is completely normal in **every game in the entire world**, so what do they do? They flame. But hey, dont' forget that if you don't like it you can always mute. \n\nNormal people **do not troll**. Because normal people don't find pleasure in destroying things. Normal people find pleasure in winning, not in destroying , therefore all players that ever played lol have said unpleasant things on chat at least once, but **not all** have intentionally destroyed someones game. Because wanting to win is normal, but wanting your teammates to lose is not. \n\n","replies":[{"poster":"Citizen Kayn","date":"2019-07-21T13:41:17.977+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"Adding to that. Trolling can't be muted and you are forced to sit with them up till the end if there are two of them and they don't want to surr. \n\nConcluding: Trolling is the ultimate way of destroying the game that players cannot do anything about it, therefore it should be the thing that gets highest punishment (premaban). Players have tools to fight flame, therefore flame should be punishable (with no chat or 14 day bans) but never with permaban. \n\nI think that someone that intentionally destroyed your promo deserves a punishment more than someone that told you \"sell skin\".\n\n> against the rules you agreed to upon creating an account to begin with.\n\nWrong. Correct version \"not against the rules you agreed to upon creating an account to begin with, but against the rules that were created in a meantime after years\".
