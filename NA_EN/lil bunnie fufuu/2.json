Very confused","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi,\n\nyesterday I updated my LoL client with the updates from Patch 7.15. When I opened the client today, it told me it was reverting the client to an older version (with no explanation why). It reverted the client to Patch 7.14, which meant I had to download and install all the updates for Patch 7.15. I am very confused as to why this is happening as I already updated and even played a few games (20 minute low priority queue games - due to my internet dc'ing during ascension) with the update. \n\nIf it's any help, I have not verified my account.\n\nDownloading patch 7.15 updates right now and I've had trouble getting them done (i.e. the update box, the one that pops up before the login screen, is downloading more than the 206.6 MB, meaning that the login screen never loads - allowing me to progress to the next step of the download) so any help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-31T03:58:13.000+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmm it sounds like some of those patch files aren't being applied correctly, so your client is running into errors here and there.
