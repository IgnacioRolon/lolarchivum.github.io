Per our [refund guidelines](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751864-Content-Refund-FAQ), we could look into providing a refund for the chroma purchase if you have a refund token.  If you don't, hit us up in a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) anyway, and we'll see if we can work something out.  I can't guarantee anything but we like to look at each case individually.  I hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
