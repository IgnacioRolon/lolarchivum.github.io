Firefighter Tristana is a Legacy skin and does not show up in the store, but if you own it it should show up on her champion page in your profile. You select skins in Champion Select after you've chosen and locked in your champion.\n\nCould you give me more details about where you are not seeing it where you think you should? Also, when you \"upgraded\" the skin through Hextech Crafting, do you mean you rerolled 3 skins to craft it, you spent Orange Essence to craft it from the shard, or did you simply receive the shard by opening a Hextech Chest?\n\nLet me know details so we can figure this out. Pictures may help (you must upload the picture to a third party site, then link the image URL).","replies":[{"poster":"TravisL98","date":"2016-09-10T06:10:28.819+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I do have Tristana and I spent Orange Essence to crat it from the shard.\nI cannot see it in the store or on her champion page in my profile.I mean I can barely see four skins in her profile in addition to the original one.\nLiterally,I was robbed by firefighter Tristana and she does not show up again.TAT","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-09-10T06:28:36.106+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have you tried reloading your client?
