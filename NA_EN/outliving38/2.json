A blind, you can run away. With this, you don't know which way is -away- since you can't actually see anything. She's losing the damage on her Q though because she's getting that super powerful form of CC on top of her passive getting more damage early and late, though about the same mid-game (More if she's behind, less if she's ahead)","replies":[{"poster":"Ziovi","date":"2015-11-14T08:48:55.333+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually, it's stronger in almost every part of the game.\nHer PBE passive her lower damage than the current one only on lower levels.\nTo be exact, for her current passive to be stronger than the PBE one, she need to have at least 44 (total) AD at lvl 1,  63 at lvl 2, 83 at lvl 3, 107 at lvl 4. As you can see, at level 3 the PBE one isn't losing to the current one anymore.\nAt lvl 8, her PBE passive is stronger than the current one unless she has at least 250 total AD.  At level 10 it's 375 total AD, which she usually doesn't even reach in the whole game.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BeatzBoyFTW","date":"2015-11-14T08:42:56.598+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do note that her new blind effect is like Graves's W or Nocturne's ult, not Teemo's Q.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ziovi","date":"2015-11-14T08:41:46.018+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Having her passive damage increased is actually a very nice surprise, i have to say. Well, actually the damage will be lower at level 1 and 2, but that's negligible, and she gain way more as she gains levels.\n\nBut, i want to point out that she is not \"getting her blind back\" because they are not giving her a blind. It's sight reduction, pretty much like graves' W and nocturne's R. Sounds interesting though.\n\nBtw, i made a comparison between the old passive (pre-rework) and theone currently on PBE, and the new one is actually stronger at every stage of the game. That actually sounds... a bit too strong... i mean, since we can proc the new one a lot more often than the old one, which was already pretty strong...  I'm starting to think that surrender at 20 maybe made a mistake and in the PBE the scaling is only on bonus AD. I'll check it later on PBE myself, if i manage to start a game.\n\nEdit: my bad, i didn't notice i made a mistake. Her passive on PBE is stronger than live, but still weaker than how it used to be before preseason. At lvl 18, you lose 66 damage per proc. However, since you activate the passive a lot more often, it still outdamages the old one.\n\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"GhastlyGhoulMan","date":"2015-11-14T07:58:48.601+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm actually surprised that I've seen so many posts disappointed with the current Quinn. Her burst is insane now, and her map presence rivals if not trumps Shen's now. I've only played four games with her so far, but haven't lost a single one, and actually ended up carrying the teams in those games. \n\nThat being said, I will not look a gift horse in the mouth if buffs are incoming. :3","replies":[]}]}
