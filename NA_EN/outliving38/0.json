The ADC role had virtually no class subset before patch 5.22. The strongest ADCs were - simply put - the ones who were the best Period. There wasn't a whole lot of strategic choice in the matter. Can your ADC deal an insane amount of damage in the shortest amount of time while having a modicum of safety? Great! This is why there was always a holy trinity of ADCs since the game was released. Once upon a time, that was Cait, Ez, Corki; during this year's worlds it was Trist, Kalista and Jinx. You never picked an ADC to accommodate a certain playstyle or team composition because their ability to influence different matchups was basically non-existent. By contrast, you have a great variety of characters you can choose midlane, assassins, pokers, control mages, AP and AD... the list goes on. Riot explained many times over that they wanted to bring strategic diversity into the mix while making sure that a match can't be decided at champ-select. \n\nNow let's talk about Quinn and why she needed a change. Quinn has had a historically abysmal career in LoL. Her pick-rate hovered between 0.5 and 1%, her winrate was in the mid 40% and she was marred by AA bugs since her release. Quinn's strengths were always determined by two things; her ability to duel and mobility. Being that she is a Demacian scout, it makes sense that a great deal of her power budget would be stored in her traversal skills. In case you haven't been around long enough to see the days when Kass, TF, Panth, Shen, Rammus, Hecarim, Shyvanna or (more recently) teleport were powerful then let me spell it out for you; the ability to quickly re-position your character across the map is a very powerful ability. To compensate for that amped-up power, Riot decided to remove her blind, that being said Quinn is still very bursty with Harrier, and very hard to skirmish against. In fact, bar Vayne I don't really know if there's another ADC that has better dueling potential.\n\nSo no, Quinn is not bad, and she has never been a good pick botlane over other ADCs. Seriously, bring her top lane and watch as _Riven _ continually fails to catch you, cries \"OP\", and watches you gank her allies as she hopelessly tries to catch up on farm. Quinn hilariously counters melee, it's insane.","replies":[{"poster":"lightdragoon88","date":"2015-11-12T19:46:43.355+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Well said.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Tysmin","date":"2015-11-12T01:19:00.696+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":3,"body":"lol your the dummy who spent rp to buy her","replies":[{"poster":"LilQuacker","date":"2015-11-12T03:37:39.072+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ikr lol","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Shac Norris","date":"2015-11-12T01:10:33.440+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The only thing i regret with her is the blind\n\n\nThat's pretty much it.\n\nBy the way, the ''HAHAHAHAHAHA'' makes you sound really mad.. you probably shouldn't say that","replies":[]},{"poster":"ChaosReignsDown","date":"2015-11-13T14:26:00.438+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think letting her move while channeling her ult would help a bit.","replies":[]},{"poster":"fear of Quinn","date":"2015-11-18T01:10:18.876+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"New Quinn is a trash.
