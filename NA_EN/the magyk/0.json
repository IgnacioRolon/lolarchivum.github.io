This means that if a patch comes through when I am at 3000 IP i cant but anything worth more than that until the next patch when i hopefully have more IP then what i had wanted to buy is worth. This wouldnt be so bad if i could say, build up 7800 IP, wait for a patch, then be able to buy anything for the rest of the patch but no. If i spend any ip the top amount of IP i can spend drops with it. \r\nIf i start at 3000 and spend to below 1350 then no matter how much more i gain i cant buy anything worth more than 1350. {{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}} \r\n\r\nI've included a picture to illustrate the problem. \r\n\r\nThe part that is starting to push me away from this game is that RP is not effected by this. i can purchase and spend as much RP as i like without any issues. I have a problem with this however, i spend enough on skins and the like that id rather earn my champions with IP but with this bug i am essentially FORCED to purchase and champions i want to with RP instead of IP. If this is a bug, it would be great for it to be fixed, if its intentional then you've lost me for good riot. \r\n\r\n-end rant-{{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}} \r\n\r\nP.S. Ive seen posts before that switching back to the old client fixes the problem, that would be great if the old client would launch on my machine, which for some unknowable reason it does not.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-12T16:56:36.741+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is likely a sync issue, so returning to the legacy client should fix it up.  It's really strange that you can't get to the legacy version though, so we have to figure that out.  Are you getting any error messages, and how are you trying to load it?  Have you tried both methods:\n\n-  On the login screen of the open beta updated client, look for the \"Launch Legacy Client\" text at the bottom.\n-  Or create a shortcut directly to the legacy client in your League Installation. Just look for \"lol.launcher\"\n\nLet me know!","replies":[{"poster":"The Magyk","date":"2017-01-12T17:10:00.432+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Creating a shortcut to the admin version of the .exe was able to open the client.
