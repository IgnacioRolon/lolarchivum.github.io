I'm not sure if this is happening because of new LoL look or not. \r\nIs anyone else having this issue?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-09T02:55:36.024+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmm this kind of sounds like League is reverting to a previous patch because it noticed some damaged game files from the last time it tried to patch. Fortunately, you haven't run into any crashes yet, but I want to try and make sure you can get a clean copy of the patch finally. \n\nLet's try going over the steps in our [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to make sure everything is in order there first. Let me know if you can patch, then close the client and reopen it. If it doesn't try to patch awesome! If you're still having to patch every time hit me back and we can dig a little deeper.","replies":[]}]}
