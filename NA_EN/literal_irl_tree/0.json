Which made us end up losing because it was just the first to break down the towers because no one could teamfight throughout the entirety of the game.. Has this happened to anyone else?","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-05-17T00:08:40.181+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"If all 10 players in the game were experiencing the same exact lag spikes, then it is possible that there was an issue on that individual game server :(  Have you experienced any problems in any of the games since?

Also i thought i would mention the renekton was perhaps not lagging because he had very good farm and was ~21/2/10 and was acting perfectly fine throughout the game.. I don't know how to show you the match history all i can say is that i was playing sion and had a zz'rot and 1/~25/0 about 2 weeks ago... Hope that explains enough {{champion:32}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"hi im Rektless","date":"2016-05-16T14:08:00.991+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"me2 and my friends but we are in greece EUNE like i have a stable 70 ping and latest 2 days it just goes to 2k 3k then 500-which means ur disconnected then i went to my EUW account to check and played 3 games none of them lagged","replies":[]}]}
