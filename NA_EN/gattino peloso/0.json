So even if you're trying not to lag and be respectful to your team you should still click around on and move on base. \n\nYou also may wanna try Riot's connection KB if the lagging is happening a lot to you. It can help fix that issue if its a persistent one:https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues\n\nI'll be on for a bit so feel free to reach out to me. {{champion:25}} {{summoner:4}} {{item:3157}}","replies":[]}]}
