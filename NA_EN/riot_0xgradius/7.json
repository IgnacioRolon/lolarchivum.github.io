The longer answer is that they use whatever language they think is best for the task at hand. I believe I recall someone saying they use C++ (or was it C#?) for the in-game client (don't take my word for it). They obviously use a lot of ActionScript/Flex for the PVP.net client (which runs in adobe AIR). They probably use a large number of scripting languages on the server-side. And if they ever just need a little tool to help them with daily work, then they can make that in whatever language they see fit.\n\nIn addition to that though, they also use a number of frameworks, such as Scaleform which does part of the graphics for the in-game client. Maestro is a little thing they use to coordinate the different parts of the client. And I believe they also use some things like Hadoop for their web development.\n\nI hope that answers your question. And hopefully I didn't crush you with the wall of text. :P\n\nObligatory Disclaimer: I didn't check my facts. It's just what I remember from reading other Riot responses in the past. If anything I said was incorrect, I apologize profusely.\n\n*-Scampers away-*\n\n{{summoner:6}}","replies":[{"poster":"cautomaton","date":"2014-05-08T18:51:46.785+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's not a bad summary. I can be a bit more specific:\n\nWe try to be pragmatic about language and framework use, i.e. - use the best tool for the job. So, we use **C/C++** for the game client and game server. The pvp.net launcher uses **ActionScript**.\n\nFor server-side, we primarily use *Java* except for the game server itself, which as mentioned is in C/C++. So the login servers, match-making servers, champ select, and so on are all Java. We use a fairly typical open source enterprise Java stack of software there.\n\nFor our websites, many still use **PHP** though we increasingly use a variety of languages and tools for our websites. Many are statically generated using a PHP framework. Others have **node.js** backends for APIs and leverage **JavaScript** for dynamic content (these forums are an example of that tech).\n\nAnd then we have a host of other languages and tools. We use big data frameworks like hadoop and hbase. For our DevOps and server management work, we use a lot of **Ruby** and contribute heavily to the open source **Chef** framework for server management. Some game tools are written in **C#** and some monitoring and scripting use **Python**. I've even seen a little **Scala** and **Go Lang** show up in the repos.\n\nI'm always happy to answer any engineering related questions!","replies":[]},{"poster":"HBombzorz","date":"2014-05-07T09:52:41.395+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have wondered that, and  now feel lucky to be fluent in C# at this moment :P.

I would think that at the start, it would be rough to get used to the raw level of abstract thought and math-like logical thinking required. There's a lot of weird things that you have to just start understanding before you can really get to the good stuff where you piece it all together. After you figure out the fundamentals though, I would think that it would become more natural if you do a lot of writing. Because when you think about it, writing and computer science (and engineering in general) both involve an awful lot of orchestrating different pieces to work together and creating one bigger picture that flows elegantly. Although, the devil really is in the details for computer science, as well.\n\nI dunno. Those are just my 1AM thoughts on the matter.
