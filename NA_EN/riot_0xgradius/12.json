Often when you're playing with system memory, you want something that's easily identifiable when you're skimming through memory values, and 0x41 repeated is commonly used. \n\ntl;dr - I'm a security nerd, hah.","replies":[{"poster":"Samflash3","date":"2016-03-18T01:51:21.942+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ri0t Gradi0x41?\n\n\nBut serious question.

Pretty much if it's on Riot's network, I want to make sure it's secure as possible without slowing down Rioter's work days.
