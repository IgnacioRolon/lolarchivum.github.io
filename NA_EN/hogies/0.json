I started making upgrades to my PC hardware the beginning of October 2016. At that time, I started noticing issues were my PC would lose display completely. Both screens go black, blue lights turn orange on monitors, and the hardware (Fans - PSU- Etc..) would still be running. At this point I am unable to to restart my PC unless I cut the power plug or flick switch on PSU. After removing all new pieces of hardware, the issue was still happening. As of the last 4 times its happened, was at the end of a match on summoners rift, right as the defeat or Win graphics come up. I have never had this happen before that. i am thinking it is a coincidence or timing that something updated/changed when i installed new hardware into my PC but I would like to see if anyone else has experienced this exact same issue. \r\n\r\nSystem Specs:\r\n\r\n-Windows 10 Home\r\n-AMD FX-8350 8 Core 4.0GHz\r\n-16GB 1833Mhz RAM\r\n-AMD Radeon R7 200 Series (Have a  MSI Radeon RX 480 DirectX 12 RX 480 GAMING X 8G 8GB 256-Bit GDDR that was installed but RMA'd it for replacement because I thought it was the issue to this problem)\r\n-500GB Samsung 750 Evo SSD\r\n-850W LEPA G Series PSU\r\n-MSI 970 Gaming Mobo","replies":[{"poster":"PaladinNO","date":"2016-12-23T18:41:23.389+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you have a PC speaker (small speaker connected directly to the motherboard) installed? \nIf you have, does it beep more than once at any time?\n\nDid you change your motherboard with this upgrade?
