The game doesn&#039;t pause for those 1:30 for you to just sit there.\n\n The game isn&#039;t listening to your jungle thinking he prattles about how the enemy ivern or nunu or shaco or who ever might gib your red or blue for you to ignore it while they plead for it to be warded at 1:30.\n\nThe game isn&#039;t watching the enemy with a blitz or naut or thresh or morg or etc in the loading screen only to not watch for an invade. Your trinket isn&#039;t a pretty little item that doesn&#039;t do anything for the first 3:00 of the game.( just a hint you get a 2nd charge at around 3:30 when junglers start to get ready to gank.)\n\nThe jungler really only gets 1:30 of the game where you need to babysit them, after that the jungle&#039;s main focus is to help you. So please, I know there have been plenty of junglers who just sit in the jungle and dont gank (or maybe you just think that about junglers just having bad games), but we really do need your help in the pre-minion game. A simple invade, a simple unknowing about the status of our buffs is enough to ruin our early game. There is no exp to miss in lane, no CS to be lost during this time. We need your help for that first 1:30 of the game, after that we will be looking to help you. \n\nSo please, use your trinket, save your jungle, and save a life.","replies":[{"poster":"Melledoneus","date":"2017-04-26T17:57:48.723+0000","up_votes":109,"down_votes":3,"body":"Lies.\n\nThat period of time is for flashing mastery and spamming emotes with teammates.
