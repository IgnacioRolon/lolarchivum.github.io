Her Q basically becomes a triple attack with the sated devourer because the 2nd hit is technically an on hit effect dropping obscene amounts of damage while she still has insane clear speeds. \r\nMeanwhile more niche junglers like irelia rely heavily on the interactions with sated to help them have an impact. (yes im a huge jungle irelia fan with the sated)\r\nThe reason the devourer is strong is not its base stats but the abilities that can be paired with it. Some champions and their abilities are justified with the sated while others aren&#039;t. \r\n\r\nTL:DR Change the interactions with the troublesome abilities instead of nerfing the item or abilities.","replies":[{"poster":"RiotRepertoir","date":"2015-08-13T06:45:08.262+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":1,"body":"At this point, I'd say it's not out of the question that Devourer was addressed on the champion level rather than the item level itself (assuming it needs adjustment, that is).

You think cinderhulk release was bad? This is way worse. The difference here is that there are currently 2 OP items. We have devourer which is abused by many champs, and there is Runeglaive which is abused by only a few. Both of these items make a bunch of junglers \"viable\" that can't survive without these items. However, being \"viable\" is not enough. Not when there's a handful of junglers that are GODLIKE.\n\nIn the meanwhile, the highest winrate Warrior jungler is Shaco at #12. The highest \"position\" Warrior jungler is Vi at #18. What do you think about this, RiotRepertoir? This is even worse than the tank junglers were in the times of juggernaut.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SaltyKracka","date":"2015-08-13T15:41:52.296+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RiotRepertoir,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Pl4auOZj,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-08-13T06:45:08.262+0000)\n>\n> At this point, I'd say it's not out of the question that Devourer was addressed on the champion level rather than the item level itself (assuming it needs adjustment, that is).
