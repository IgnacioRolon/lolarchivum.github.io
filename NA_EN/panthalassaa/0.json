It constantly gets bug splat and i've never had any other game or program crash more than once on my computer. League on the other hand. The client actually crashes and bug splats at least 2 times a day. I've tried a fresh re-install, running as admin. nothing seems to fix it. My brothers usually have the same issue.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-15T22:24:20.604+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bug splats are an entirely different matter and are usually caused by a poor driver or hardware interaction with your computer.
