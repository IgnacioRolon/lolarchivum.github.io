Ever sense i got it when i go to ping my holding G and Drag for the ping i need. But when i click G to ping and i drag the selector doesn't go where i want it to go. For example I click G and i want to ping \"On My Way\" (That's on the right side of the wheel) but i sometimes shows my mouse on the left side of the wheel or on some rare occasions Up or Down. If anyone has a fix for this that would be great! This bug... glitch or what ever it called is really annoying and i want to try to fix ASAP. This is the only play it is doing it.
