The [Leaverbuster](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ) system only takes action with 20-minute low priority queues after there's a trend of disconnections on your account. Because these disconnections negatively impact everyone in the match, regardless of the reason for the disconnection, the system treats all disconnections equally. This is a key reason why these penalties cannot be removed or modified.\n\nIt sounds like your connection is unstable to the server, for which I recommend working through our [connection guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to address.
