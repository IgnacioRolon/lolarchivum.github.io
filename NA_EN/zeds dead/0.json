I will be running 35-47 ms with 60+ frames per sec. Once I get a lead and we are stomping the enemy team our pings start spiking not just me but everyone's pings start spiking to 1.4k-2k and I watch as my character freezes in place to then end up gray screened. I checked my internet and I am running just fine, no latency issues server end at all. Any time I am near an enemy champion my ping will spike to ridiculous heights then return to normal once I'm dead. This doesn't happen every game but when it does Its 9/10 once we have pulled a lead and starting to stomp. Just curious as if others are experiencing this...","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-09T01:30:38.972+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This could be happening for one of two reasons.
