My ping stays at a solid 55 as i have it connected with ethernet on my 1 gig internet so i know it's not that. My fps averages about 380, but when i click or move my camera it takes a couple miliseconds to register. You buy a new laptop expecting to get a better gaming experience, but it was the opposite. I'm not sure what to do. I don't need input to help derank me to bronze, i already have that under control myself.","replies":[{"poster":"5050BS","date":"2017-01-20T11:05:11.838+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This has been happening for over a week now.
