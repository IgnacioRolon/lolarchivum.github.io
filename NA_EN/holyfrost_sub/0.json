At this point, any additional work the ChampUp team does, they put on their OWN plate, by slating Yorick for a rework and then repeatedly working on other champions while shelving him for literally years. There comes a point where either they need to full stop and _get Yorick done,_ or accept that he's not moving forward and that they will have additional work to do on him when they finally _do_ start moving again.\n\nI dunno, the whole situation just rubs me the wrong way. I've never in my life had a job where \"it'll be easier if I don't do this now and wait for someone else to do their job first\" has worked as a reason, unless I could prove that the someone else in question was doing their part of the job already or very soon.

(For example, Yorick's zombie ult was created a week before release and was originally a combination of Thresh's ult and Karthus's E).\n\n2.  **Yorick is difficult to create skins for:**  Yorick falls under the same \"category\" as Elise, Zyra and Zac in that there is much more to the champion than the main model itself.  The ghouls would each require a new look to differentiate them between each skin, along with the effects.  Not that this should have stopped them from doing anything, but...\n\n3.  **Yorick was put on a \"no promotion\" list by Riot:**  Yorick was removed from the free week rotation nearly three years ago (along with Poppy) and was put on a \"no new skins\" list soon afterwards.  You'll also notice that Yorick's obscured on his Pentakill skin page in the client (He's hidden by his skins on the left side) and was barely mentioned during the 2014 Pentakill event.  This lack of promotion also included new skins, which could have been done long before he was put on the rework list.  _Speaking of which..._\n\n4.  **Yorick is _scheduled_ for a rework... maybe:**  Simply put, Yorick's rework has been shifted to the back burner in favor of easier projects, like Sion and Poppy.  Taric is supposedly next on the list, with his art assets needing to be cemented at the present time.  However, just after Yorick on the \"high priority\" list is Urgot and _there's no guarantee_ that Riot or ChampUp would finish working on the Gravedigger before starting on the Headman's Pride.\n\n5.  **Delivering a skin for Yorick now would only lead to more work for ChampUp:**  Another champion in the same boat as Yorick was Trundle.  The skins team was asked to not make new projects for Trundle until his rework was done in 2013, which leads to...\n\n6.  **There's no _guarantee_ that Yorick would remain Yorick after the rework:**  See Trundle after the Freljord patch.  Riot could pull something even bigger than that fiasco and change the green undead brute into a generic necromancer, thus destroying any skins that could have been made.\n\nSo, while the skins team is waiting _right now_ for the rework to get done before Yorick is eligible for a new skin (which might come in late 2017 If Sion is any indication), they're also at fault for having _never_ done one beyond his two launch skins.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Burliose","date":"2017-03-18T10:58:52.467+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What about corporate yorick?

I and every time someone brings up this guy we always get a response akin to, \"his kit is out dated and were not sure what we can do to make it new while still being balanced\" If we could hear something new other than the standard responses like that it would lend more credibility to the statement that we haven't forgotten Yorick Mori","replies":[]},{"poster":"IronwallJackson","date":"2015-12-01T15:14:53.767+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot haven't bothered making skins for Yoric because they'd trying their best to not acknowledge his existence.

Although they have \"lied\" about that like with Evelynn. they claim she wasnt getting a new skin till her rework only to have that Safecracker skin. while it is a low tier skin it still a new skin for her. So hopefully we see some new skins its horrible when you have champs with such a low skin count, yet champions who already have loads (Blitz, Annie, Ryze. Ahri, etc) can get more and more.\n\nI understand why more popular champs will get more skins, but it shouldnt mean the older the champ the less skins comes out. Hell im waiting on Taric to get a better skin. his current skin is nice, but we need more. Along with other champions like Yorick, Urgot, Udyr, Lablanc. its crazy. especially when you put into account the community has made some very awesome/detailed skins concept that they could implement (unless its copyright) but chooses not to!","replies":[{"poster":"GreenLore","date":"2015-12-01T18:00:38.257+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The thing with eve is that her general character shape probably won't change at all.\nI mean regardless of how her rework will look,she will still keep that humanoid body shape(maybe with some added body parts like wings or a tail,if they want to make her more succubus-like,but those can be easily added on top of her safecracker skin)\n\nWith yorick however?His rework could change his look completely,so that whatever skins he had before can't be just adjusted to his rework.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"EndlessSorcerer","date":"2015-12-01T15:21:30.376+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good choice on Undertaker Yorick.
