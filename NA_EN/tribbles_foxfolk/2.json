I&#039;ve tested this for at least 3 FULL GAMES and it happened every game.\n\nAlso, I'm going to add that it doesn't matter where Caitlyn is on the map, the noise happens with Love Tap procs. I was using the Arcade Miss Fortune skin every time.\n\nThis is really infuriating and makes it really hard to concentrate on what you&#039;re doing. I will be sure to get a video posted of this audio bug later.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-11-18T19:19:07.920+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Eevee Girl Alex! \n\nThank you for the report!

Believe me, with MF being my favorite ADC (Kog'Maw's second and Quinn's third :P) this patch, this audio glitch bugged the hell out of me.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-11-18T21:31:00.085+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Haha, I can't say I blame you!

Arcade MF is pretty popular, and Cait's being played much more frequently, so this wouldn't be uncommon. :c\n\nI have to say, though, I almost prefer Captain Miss Fortune. It may not be as flashy with its particles, but it's a very elegant skin with nice detail and a really great style for MF.\n\nBut, that's besides the point. Thanks again for noticing, glad the bug's being patched out. Any ETA on the fix being released? I want to guess that it's next patch, but I don't wanna take any guesses or add any unnecessary pressure.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-11-18T22:00:19.986+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, I worked on that skin!

Oh well, at least there's an ETA on it.
