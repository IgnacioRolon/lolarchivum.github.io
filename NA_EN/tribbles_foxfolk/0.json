I'd say Maokai, Sion, maybe even Gnar (engage while Mega, not Mini).\n\nIdk, I'm not an expert.","replies":[{"poster":"Godaren","date":"2015-04-09T17:40:13.232+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yorick man, you cannot lose that lane you have sustain poke out trade him and your w pops shrooms if you see him place them.

He will out trade you if you don't engage properly, and you need to basically go agro every time you're mega unless it's a very bad idea.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"o0Danil0o","date":"2015-04-09T14:49:46.680+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also purchased a Paysafe yesterday ... still waiting -_- Pls Rito release this","replies":[]}]}
