Either bugs or Riot lying about Aatrox.","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":11,"down_votes":3,"body":"According to http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-75-revisiting-aatrox Riot states only one way for Aatrox to deplete his passive. &quot;_Aatrox fills his Blood Well through his abilities. **When it fills entirely, the Well begins to empty over 4 seconds**, giving him a new buff - Blood Rush - for the duration_&quot; This means Aatrox&#039;s passive should ONLY decrease when it reaches 5 stacks, NOT within a given time frame. You should be able to fill 40% of the Blood Well, afk for 5 mins somewhere or even die, and still have 40% of the Blood Well filled.\r\n\r\nAnother issue is that you state that Aatrox can still stack his Passive when under the effects of Blood Rush which could mean a potential infinite Blood Rush BUT that does not hold true. &quot;_While under the effects of this buff, dealing or taking damage versus champions will fully refresh its duration (and fully refill the Blood Well)._&quot; If this holds true then why does Aatrox NOT gain stacks and lose all his Blood Well stacks during the 4 seconds Blood Rush has activated? If I use a Q and E while Blood Rush is active, Blood Rush should either have its duration prolonged or end with me having Blood Well 40% filled up. Instead what actually happens is that Blood Rush lasts 4 seconds and ends with you having 0% in Blood Well.\r\n\r\nThe last problem with Riot&#039;s post is that Aatrox&#039;s new E should have a 70% bonus AD ratio but in-game it is only 20% bonus AD ratio.\r\n\r\nEither the post was rushed or the game devs didn&#039;t do their jobs right. Either way, someone was slacking. (I have no clue where to put this discussion as it covers gameplay, bugs, concepts and creations, boards feedback, and general discussion so I&#039;ll have it in Gameplay).","replies":[{"poster":"TheHappyReaperz","date":"2017-03-27T17:20:27.622+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"The only possible bug here is the AD ratio not functioning as it should, which should be reported in the \"Report A Bug\" section. Everything else, is simply a matter of logic. Aatrox's Blood Well drains when out of combat, like it always has, and thus wasn't a change that would be covered in the update post. Your Bloodwell only refills, when draining, when you take or deal damage from/to enemy champions. And that is the only way. If you Q and hit some minions it shouldn't fill the passive bar, that's how it works.","replies":[{"poster":"clickhead","date":"2017-03-30T12:36:53.741+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's still problematic, because right now the tooltip in-game doesn't say that.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DonnieDarkin","date":"2017-03-27T18:25:36.368+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"Fuck Riot.","replies":[]}]}
