This system is rigged. as i said thats going overboard riot come on atleast warn them about this stuff so people can change their behavior. my friend sure did he doesn&#039;t say anything anymore and its because you guys left him off with a warning when he said worse stuff than me. And I was mad that day first off with parents screaming at my face for not helping. and that right there got me mad so the moment someone talked crap I was just mad and when a kill got stolen I couldn't help it.","replies":[{"poster":"AthenasVendetta","date":"2017-01-23T04:05:15.975+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"Logs will more than likely support the ban, however if you disagree you can take it up with support via ticket or see if the community agrees and allow them to decide off that.

An argument between two players can easily create a negative experience for the rest of the players in the game with you. Regardless of the other player’s actions, this does not justify your own behavior. You alone are responsible for your actions within the game. If you encounter a toxic player like this, the best option is to simply report their behavior and move on.\n\nFrom [Understanding the Tribunal](http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=2726400): \n\n>**4) That player in my game was far worse than me. Why am I banned???**\na) I'll keep this one simple: retaliation isn't OK. Reacting to a toxic player by being toxic just incites that player to be even worse--it also ruins the game for up to 8 other players. It is far, far worse to watch two people yelling at each other all game than it is to watch 1 player ranting into blank space. Almost everyone in the game can find someone out there that behaves worse than they do--but so what? Finding someone worse doesn't justify your behavior or justify retaliation. We expect more out of our players. What players often don't realize is... those other players in your game that you thought were worse? Nearly 100% of the time, those players were banned even before you were. If someone is being toxic, just report them and move on. If you retaliate, both of you will be banned. It's really that simple.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BlastRush","date":"2017-01-23T12:05:43.237+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"VesØl","date":"2017-01-23T18:38:47.135+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Actually it was only two games and i was extremely tilted and salty asf I dont really talk smack but when i do i just say f you or stop ks you btch or something like that but that day I went all out with. someone ks me like 20 kills than after that game i got into a game with a wu kong talking trash about us so I just went all out","replies":[{"poster":"BlastRush","date":"2017-01-23T20:33:08.208+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"VesØl","date":"2017-01-23T20:46:04.650+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The thing is they just went straight to permaban and i've never gotten chatbanned or ip banned.
