Share any feedback on this with our client devs over at the client discussion boards, but in the meantime you can check your stats through the legacy client:\n\n-  On the login screen of the open beta updated client, look for the \"Launch Legacy Client\" text at the bottom.\n-  Or create a shortcut directly to the legacy client in your League Installation. Just look for \"lol.launcher\" \n\nI hope that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"Scalpalexis","date":"2017-01-21T03:06:38.026+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah this answer my question!
