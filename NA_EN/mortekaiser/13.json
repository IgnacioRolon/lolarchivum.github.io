AP centric runes (AP Quints + Magic Pen Marks) with armor + mr is also an option.\nmy personally preferred masteries: http://i.imgur.com/kRyvGDk.png\nboosting my healing in any way helps laning immensely\n5) you deal a lot of base damage with simply leveling up. rylais will boost your damage significantly, an AP core of Rylais/Sorcs/Abyssal will probably kill anything that isn't a tank with all 3 Q autos\n\nthese are just my personal things that I've used to strong success, morde is actually quite forgiving when it comes to build paths, although I still don't suggest anyone ever build trinity force on him","replies":[]},{"poster":"Annoxis","date":"2016-02-15T12:47:55.160+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think I can answer some of your questions.\n1. Lots of place. I prefer him top and bot (as ADC). Since he is item reliant, he tends to struggle against early champ/champ with lots of CC. He performs well against Assassins/Squishy in general, but struggle against tanks, like Sion, Poppy or Shen.\n\nHe can be successful bot, but you need to give your support advice about how he should support Morde. Morde with always be more succesful with a Tank support with initiation. Leona, Nautilus, Thresh, Blitz, Shen, etc... Becaise you need to play aggressive with Morde.\n\n2. Rylai is the must have on Morde. Boots are dependant on the opposing team. Hextech Gunblade is the item that gives him the most damage in the game. Since you need Tankyness, you must reserve two items slots, one for Armor, one for MR. These two will mostly be Deadmans's Plate and Spiritual Visage. Your last item is dependant on what you want, but must give you both HP with AD or AP, knowing that Black Cleaver and Titanic Hydra are not options.\n\nI will respond to 3, 4 & 5 later.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Wolfess","date":"2016-02-15T11:45:40.629+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"are you the hank hill to mordekaiser's pro-pain?","replies":[{"poster":"Mortekaiser","date":"2016-02-15T12:17:47.764+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Wolfess,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=17K8ptR8,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-02-15T11:45:40.629+0000)\n>\n> are you the hank hill to mordekaiser's pro-pain?\n\nalways purchase rylais for a clean burning kill","replies":[]}]}]}
