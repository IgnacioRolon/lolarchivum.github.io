Hopefully the people that only wish to stomp games where they are on a comfortable aram champ will dodge more often and tire of participating in a format that was originally fun and silly and relaxed. People wanting to play specific champions might consider avoiding a format designated all RANDOM all mid. There are several other places where they can enjoy the champion they wish to play without infringing on the principle of this game mode.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Serophous","date":"2017-01-13T17:45:04.292+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"ARAM just needs all champs unlocked instead of champs owned + rotating.","replies":[]},{"poster":"lGIaurunGl","date":"2017-01-13T13:43:57.173+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree, make all champs available, would also be a good way to learn champions that you don't own.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lewjac","date":"2017-01-13T06:53:32.595+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay seriously all i do is play aram if no1 i kno is online or i try to wind down after work, so that being said i have run into my teams all adc and they are mostly ap and 1 tank they won, ive run into my whole team is tank with no range and no go in until 1 of us hits  lvl6 and the whole team is 3 ap and 2 ad and we won. I think aram is suppose to be a fun casual game type not to take so damn seriously and i also think its a great place to focus your skills like team fights and find new ways to play champs. Think about it if you are always the guy (or girl) stuck on some tank against ranged and/or cc you shouldve learned by now some tricks to avoid it or go threw it. I mean serilously aram has helped me position better in teamfights and dodge incoming abilities. You either play it for a time killer or you play it to hone your skills, there is no competive aram!","replies":[]}]}
