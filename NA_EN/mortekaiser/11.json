{"poster":"Mortekaiser","date":"2015-08-22T13:07:00.071+0000","title":"Why did Riot give morde more complexity,too much counterplay,polarized gameplay,and call it healthy?","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":48,"down_votes":10,"body":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKe_IMl92sg\r\n\r\n(some of) my thoughts on the matter cover :25 - :45 seconds\r\n\r\nhere&#039;s some context: I was a huge fan of the old morde kit (pre-rework), and I loved how simple it was. I mained it for half of season 4 and from the start of season 5 to now. I have played 830 games of old mordekaiser from when the new match history was launched (for however that goes back).\r\n\r\nNo matter how much people bitch and moan about how morde was before, he had been played with and against for so long people could deal with his powerspikes very well. Pre-rework, Morde sat at around 50-51% winrate across all elos. He obviously had his strengths, but wasn&#039;t so powerful to just outright win every game he ever played. He had a niche, and while he didn&#039;t have the playrate that thresh, vayne, or leona have, he had his loyal mains who played him, as well as people who played him whenever he had a very favorable matchup.\r\n\r\nFast forward to now, and we have the current mess. Mordekaiser, who used to be simple, straightforward, and a champion based almost entirely on positioning instead of making immensely flashy plays, is now a champion with a lot more gimmicks, more arbitrary complexity, ramp up time on the one ability that most of his power budget is invested in, and less options in solo laning altogether. \r\n\r\nWhy?\r\n\r\nWhy does he need to be such a drastically different champion than he was before? \r\n\r\nWhat makes altering his Q, a strong ability in its own rights, into a ramp up? Morde&#039;s old Q was a solid ability in a solo lane, and it could be maxed first in a top lane environment quite comfortably. It gave him a source of good damage that could be accessed instantly and punish a player for being isolated from their minion wave if they chose to fight Morde. It wasn&#039;t an instagib level of damage (although it could be built that way with lichbane), but it was certainly enough to make opponents think twice about cockily walking up to him. \r\n\r\nSide note: Morde was a champ that punished or rewarded positioning. That alone was something that held him back from just dominating everything. If he got caught out during a bad extension and the opposing laner was someone who could dish out consistent damage to him while CCing him (a lot of champs can do this relatively easily), Morde was dead.\r\n\r\nWhat makes altering his W, a strong ability in its own rights, into an ability locked only for botlane morde who has a support? Morde&#039;s W before the rework was a perfectly fine ability, and gave him some strong situational mobility in a solo lane. It was strong enough to possibly max first (this was seen in an LCS game where morde was played in), but overall was strong enough with one point in it to save morde&#039;s life every now and then.\r\n\r\nWhat makes altering his E, again, a strong ability in its own rights, into a shadow of its former self? On a champ that absolutely needs waveclear due to lacking mobility and CC? And keeping the health costs the same? Why on earth should anyone max E until last now? The health costs are large for an early max, and morde doesn&#039;t build spellvamp anymore.\r\n\r\nWhy does morde&#039;s ult become unavailable when a dragon ghost is captured? A dragon ghost that is mostly ignorable during teamfights that aren&#039;t over the first dragon and only makes morde situationally strong? Morde&#039;s ult used to be a simple DoT and the rest of his kit was strong enough that it didn&#039;t need to have such a situational gimmick attached to it. If morde&#039;s team is strong enough to take dragon and get that dragon ghost, then they were probably going to get a tower off of that anyway. Even if not, why does the rest of morde&#039;s kit have to be balanced around it? The dragon ghost is purely a \"win more\" mechanic, nothing more. \r\n\r\nHow is being situationally powerful, with the requirements of needing a support and getting the dragon ghost, healthy gameplay?\r\n\r\nHow is being even stronger against melee champs, while being even weaker against ranged champions that can kite, healthy gameplay?\r\n\r\nBefore the rework, while morde did have bad matchups, he had options to deal with those matchups. There were a few matchups he would win outright, a lot of matchups that were skill based, and some matchups he lost very hard. Such is the way with all champions in this game. How is that considered unhealthy, when all champions are subject to that? Were Morde matchups only considered in a vacuum, where the only factors were Morde and his lane opponent? The inherent problem with that is that morde pushed waves naturally, so he would leave himself vulnerable to ganks, which, newsflash, happens all the time in every match ever. That is one of the biggest weaknesses old morde had.\r\n\r\n**So, to wrap up, a simple champion with clear strengths and weaknesses is subject to unnecessary change and alienates an entire group of players who were mains of a champion, all for the sake of making him situationally stronger, and giving him \"win more\" mechanics instead of sticking to a simple, strong brawler?**\r\n\r\nI&#039;m sorry, but just because morde can be situationally strong, does not make him a strong champion overall.","replies":[{"poster":"Big Lincoln","date":"2015-08-22T13:43:40.938+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":1,"body":"dont forget that an already vulnerable champion got an even weaker early game\n\nthis rework is terribly thought through, i hope we can get major changes to it if not a full revert","replies":[{"poster":"Jbels","date":"2015-08-22T13:48:09.824+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Solomon Money,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=a1KEPh3W,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-08-22T13:43:40.938+0000)\n>\n> dont forget that an already vulnerable champion got an even weaker early game\n> \n> this rework is terribly thought through, i hope we can get major changes to it if not a full revert\n\nI sincerely hope this becomes the first rework to hit live and get reverted within the next 2 patches","replies":[{"poster":"Rew711","date":"2015-08-22T16:51:27.143+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So many ideas on the PBE boards, no red has been seen.

The Q damage splits his hit into both physical and magical compared to Old Morde's Q of converting the entire hit into magical damage. This means that due to the way damage negation works part of his Q gets reduced by armor and the rest gets reduced by magic resist. So in order for the full damage to go through, a Morde would need to build both non-negligible amounts of armor and magic penentration.  Now if a player decides to not \"care\" about the physical part of Morde's Q, his third strike is essentially at the same power level as the Multi-hit portion of Mordekaiser's old Q!\n\nTLDR: CertainlyT essentially took the mulit-hit portion of Mordekaiser's old Q and converted into a single-target power strike. For this \"change,\" Mordekaiser's kit took various nerfs in order to \"balance\" him out.

Like, Morde now is a guy with AOE shield that needs ally to be used, completely useless poke ability and completely broken melee ability. The whole philosophy of Morde now is to hit 3rd Q - that's Morde in nutshell, his Q. Before, he was quite complicated champ. While his abilities where very simple, he had to worry about a lot of things: you had to use your abilities intelligently, manage to poke your enemy and maintain your shield while not pushing the lane too much (so you don't get ganked). There was a lot of depth - good positioning, warding, even some predictioning, like is your opponent going to facecheck that brush you are waiting in to burst someone? For me,it was one of the funniest part of old Morde: walking into some brush, and then, just wait: is he gonna enter it? Come any close to it? Ok, he entered my brush, let's do this : R-Q-E. And even when Morde was ahead, he could be shut down, because he was squishy and burstable when he didn't have his shield charged. Right now, his abilities are complicated, but his whole playstyle revolves only around his 3rd Q. You don't have to worry about lane being pushed too much. When somebody engages you, just activate your Q and smack them... The whole rework took the essence of Morde while making his kit (ekhem, I mean, his Q) super punishing against poorly positioned enemies. Also, if his ahead, he's gonna wreck everybody and win game, because he basically needs only 2 damaging items to kill somebody, then he just builds tank so it's super hard to kill him. It's kinda a shame that this rework took such a direction.

I have tried the new morde multiple times, and I can honestly say that he is more binary and toxic than ever. if he gets a good, engaging support, and an enemy adc who can't fight him early levels, he can bully the fuck out of his opponents and win. however, if he gets a poor matchup, or just a support that doesn't absolutely synergize with his abilities, then morde just loses outright, and becomes useless lategame. and when lategame hits anyway, morde simply gets outscaled unless the enemy team has no way to peel a mordekaiser off of them. and if the enemy team can peel away a champ with mobility off of their carries, what chance do you think mordekaiser will have?\n\nthis may be riot's game, but we are their playerbase. without us, riot has nothing. players do have the right to say \"hey, we don't like whats happening, and here's why\"\n\nand its a pretty big fucking issue when most of the mordekaiser feedback when outright unanswered in the pbe thread.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lunar3dge","date":"2015-08-23T03:39:32.336+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol, I've played Caitlyn as an AP caster mage :)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"MasqureMan","date":"2015-08-23T04:34:03.390+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"too much counterplay\"?

People, as in pretty much anyone who gets hit by 3 hits. There is a lot of obvious power in it and the obvious counterplay is keep away from him. Would you rather it not have ramp up and deal all its damage at once? Yes, he lost wave clear alone in exchange for that power, but his W makes it so his wave clear really hasnt suffered as long as you're in a melee lane.

What i dislike is that there is so many markmen that hardly work botlane to begin with, and they are looking into adding other kind of champion to the pool instead of looking at the ones that are currently weak. I mean, sure he is new, liek thats the goal of a rework?, and of course he will feel exciting, since he is new. \n\nWhat i'm concerned about is that they already stated that they want bot lane to be not adc reliant, and so far their solution is to load one champion and force him bot, even if it cost him his solo lane abilities. Is that really a good way to balance things ? are they going to do the same with other champions to force them there ? what happen with marksman ? they arent as strong as they used to, and now we see the first of possibly many random champion pushed bot. why would you picked them anymore ? why was having them in the game was a bad thing to begin with ? why is those champions such a better solution ?\n\n\"shake up the meta\"? i'm pretty sure we've seen all sort of stuff being played this season so far. Where are marksman going to be when those \"replacements\" become the next best thing. Because thats how adc work as a role. The best damage output build/champs are what standout and are being played to have the highest sustained dps, what if they just dont compare to those alternatives ? From the look of it, mordekaiser seem to over shadow the alternatives, and the adcs that were already underplayed, will see even less play. \n\nhttp://champion.gg/champion/Mordekaiser/ADC\n\n56% winrate plat + elo :( new best adc. i know he is still new and what not, but thats feel like such a hit to the marksman role.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mortekaiser","date":"2015-08-22T20:34:53.207+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RavenMagus,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=a1KEPh3W,comment-id=00030000,timestamp=2015-08-22T19:50:16.864+0000)\n>\n> He's an alternative to ranged marksman in the botlane, and I think that's a pretty cool thing for him to be, and for the game to have.\n> \n> Sure he could have been tuned to keep him in a solo lane instead, but there's plenty of other champs you can play in solo lanes.
