Only a month later this game came up. I am sorry to say it, but this account is out of chances. We discussed this previously, and the answer is the same. If you don't have any other concerns, I will have to consider the matter closed.\r\n\r\nmoneybooy: stfu gnar dont act nice you fool \r\nmoneybooy: my sup is more trash\r\n\r\nmoneybooy: #useless sup \r\nmoneybooy: in the end we will lose ;) \r\nmoneybooy: i plan things much worse \r\nmoneybooy: useless jg time to feed \r\nmoneybooy: dont test me kid \r\nmoneybooy: gg \r\nmoneybooy: cant even win while i gave out free kills\r\n\r\nmoneybooy: fuckign %%% \r\nmoneybooy: nice try tf \r\nmoneybooy: honor me \r\nmoneybooy: dont test me voli \r\nmoneybooy: k there goes your winnign chanc\r\n\r\nIron Wing\r\nMidlaner\r\nRiot Games Player Support","replies":[{"poster":"Periscope","date":"2020-02-22T04:12:59.689+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lockin' this thread, as the thread is pretty old.\n\nIf you have any questions about this moderation action, don't hesitate to reach out to the Boards Moderation Team via:\n\n* The [**NA Boards Discord**](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/community-moderation/7rtKBZLi-boards-moderation-discord-verification)\n* The [**Discuss the Boards**](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/community-moderation) sub-board","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rand0mH3r0X","date":"2017-07-08T22:13:30.486+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe you should've learned to /mute all.\n\nYou've gone far enough with that behavior.
