{"poster":"Karukos","date":"2016-06-06T11:20:42.121+0000","title":"Dear Riot, about Yorick's lore","subforum":"Story, Art, & Sound","up_votes":61,"down_votes":6,"body":"The Yorick rework is coming closer and closer. Many wait for it and I think everybody is excited to see what Riot is going to do about his gameplay kit and honestly so am I. However, I also know that Yorick is one hell of a rework, big in scale, same as Sion as far as we know. With sion&#039;s rework came tons of lore for the champion a bit more depth to a champion that was previously a walk Arnold Schwarzenegger reference. \r\n\r\nNow my concerns about this topic is what you are going to do with my dear Gravedigger. I really wanna see stuff added to him and explored, however, I am afraid that Yorick is going to turn into a monster, that he, in the current state of his lore, totally is not. \r\n\r\nI roleplay Yorick now for almost 5 years. Originally just chosing him cause he was open I came to love him, not cause of his playstyle, but because of how he was in placed into the Shadow Isles. A place of vile creatures with destructive behavior and psychopathic tendencies, he was the human between them. He was not here because of a choice. He was not an undead because of the wrath of chances lost or anything like that.\r\nYorick was cursed because he did not carry on the legacy and instead of being angry about it he just accepts and does his duty, working his ass off only then looking for another way when he notices that this is not the solution. And even though he did gruesome work and got somewhat dull to all of it there is a small thing inside of him that is still human as seen in his Judgement:\r\n\r\n&gt; &quot;Why do you want to join the League?&quot; The man persisted.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; &quot;I want to do... something else. I want to remember... and be remembered.&quot; Yorick felt like something was guiding his tongue. There was water on his face.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; What is this? What&#039;s happening?\r\n\r\nThere is water on his face. He is crying. He is not a monster, he is somebody without purpose and with frustration about it. he is a human trapped in this world for over many lifetimes he does not want to experience. \r\n\r\nSo now please Riot, preserve this. Perverse this human Yorick. This man who wants purpose, who wants to be remember. Who works his ass off so he might find something that gives this all meaning while he suffers from his unliving. Please Riot, do me this favor. \r\nAnd in case you wonder if people even want to see this version. I made a [post](http://askyorick.tumblr.com/post/145156206036/askthewolfandthelamb-askyorick) on my RP blog a few days ago. For the fact that Yorick is so unpopular, it did gain a fair amount of notes. So please take this into consideration when remodeling his lore.","replies":[{"poster":"RiotJaredan","date":"2016-06-06T15:41:26.527+0000","up_votes":68,"down_votes":1,"body":"All I'll say is that I know the team doesn't envision Yorick as the monster you fear he might be.","replies":[{"poster":"Brutusness","date":"2016-06-06T16:10:20.551+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"Considering, you know, Yorick's _name_, I'm guessing you guys are gonna make his character pretty Shakespearean and tragic.","replies":[{"poster":"DarkRitual","date":"2016-06-06T19:19:43.447+0000","up_votes":22,"down_votes":0,"body":"Death quote: \"Alas, poor me.\"","replies":[{"poster":"LambGotTheCakes","date":"2016-06-07T18:22:48.276+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rito plz","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Blakers1","date":"2016-06-06T19:43:38.381+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"To have played since 2009 and never known that Yorick's name comes from Hamlet...
