I thought this was the latest version. This is the first time I've gotten this error. Ever.  \n\nAm I the only one experiencing this, or are there others getting this same error? Also, is there any fix for this?\n\n\nEdit: I can't play any gamemode in league. It gives the same error no matter what. I tried playing norms. Got into champ select. Chose champ. Champ select ended.
