I have an idea though. What would happen if her Rend did true damage if the enemy champ was below say 20 or 15% health but it needed a certain amount of stacks to create the true damage. It would maybe not be broken but would require good use of the stacking of her spears and timing to get it right it could help. I don&#039;t know it was a shower thought.","replies":[{"poster":"reaperteaser","date":"2016-11-25T22:08:24.013+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"isnt she getting a buff to her rend already on the pbe?","replies":[{"poster":"F0zzyBear","date":"2016-11-25T22:11:10.194+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Exactly!
