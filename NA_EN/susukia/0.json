I just bought a Burger king gift card to use for RP but it won't let me. (I'm in Canada B.T.W) and for other people it would let them pick a card they want to use for RP, however for me it only shows me that i can only use Subway, it doesn't even give me the choice of picking a card it just sends me to the checkout with a subway gift card. \r\n\r\n Sorry if that was confusing, I'm just really need answers","replies":[{"poster":"RiotBok","date":"2016-05-04T01:26:32.152+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll do my best to break it down into both a short answer and a long answer.\n\n**Short answer:**\nUnfortunately Openbucks only supports Subway Cards in Canada at this point in time.\n\n**Long answer (aka: Why is there a difference?): **\nSo, when you're purchasing RP using these cards, you're actually using Openbucks, who has partnerships with various companies to allow for use of their gift cards to buy things like RP.   The reason why you can't use Burger King gift cards to buy RP right now is because the Openbucks platform itself does not currently support Canadian BK gift cards.  If that ever changes, then I imagine it'd be reflected for RP purchases as well.\n\nAlso, as an aside, Openbucks has an FAQ addressing cards from Canada you can check out [here](http://www.openbucks.com/support.html#canada) :D\n\nSorry if it's a bit long-winded, but I haven't seen many of these questions around on the forums so I got kind of excited to explain things :3 Lemme know if you have questions!","replies":[]}]}
