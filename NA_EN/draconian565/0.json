However, even with V-Sync, the FPS goes from like 59-61 and the pathing of the champion looks oddly weird. On top of that, since I record games, my laptop (Lenovo Y50) can't handle the V-Sync and the recording. Does anyone have a fix to this problem? Thanks","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-11-30T17:09:04.786+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In addition to V-sync, what happens if you try capping your frame rate via-ingame options?

It seem that  the  screen tearing that happenes from the start of the game always happens on the  first  game  after  u  start the  client. And also while i  was  playing  syndra in the snow urf mode after  i realeased ult  on  a  hemi i always experience screen tearing for  a few sec then it  got  normal  again, not really  sure  what's going on.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kokua","date":"2017-11-30T17:12:01.411+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I literally just installed Windows 10 yesterday, and my game is working perfectly fine. So if that version that you updated to is the latest version, then I can confirm that it works for me at least.\n\nI'm not sure if you're able to revert to an older version, but if you can, you don't need a key as your device already has a Windows 10 digital licence. If asked for a key select Skip, Do this later or I do not have a key.\n\nOfficial Microsoft response: When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be stored on Microsoft Activation Servers. Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windows 10. It will automatically reactivate. So, there is no need to know or get a product key, if you need to reinstall Windows 10, you can use your Windows 7 or Windows 8 product key or use the reset function in Windows 10. If you are prompted to enter a product key, click 'I don't have a key' and 'Do this later'","replies":[]},{"poster":"The 1 above All","date":"2017-11-30T17:07:20.138+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi, I'm also a user of windows 10 1709, and yes I've been experiencing screen tearing too. Before I always check the box  of the client where u dont allow the full screen optimization, now it seem that If i check it the game fps or lag significantly happenes more, and also sometimes restarting computer fix it for a while, since  screen tearing only happens a few times in my laptop. And btw you should check If u have downloaded the latest video driver , I'm using the nvidia one, happenes right after the client update.","replies":[]}]}
