Why do they then all add you to see if you get punished... That in it self in unhealthy to promote..... Also why in a game does one have to call out to all other players to report? It seems asking for a report should be a reportable offense. If someone offends you, report them, but asking others for a report seems once again a unhealthy habit to promote.  I know I for one am tried of reporting the word \"report\" in every single game....Let me know what you guys think?","replies":[{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2016-08-28T20:26:53.505+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"None of that is \"promoted\".

Only one report is needed per game to flag it, the number of reports in that one game has absolutely *zero* effect.","replies":[{"poster":"   iHeim       1","date":"2016-08-28T20:54:41.220+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"prove it","replies":[{"poster":"IcyPepper","date":"2016-08-28T21:06:51.913+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"[I eagerly await your response.](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/dBcmRkNo-why-the-reportingban-system-will-never-be-fair?comment=0002)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"StarTorched","date":"2016-08-30T19:11:49.348+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean, adding someone for it seems obsessive. But it shows how angry the other person is, that they want to see \"justice\" served to you. I mean, it makes sense. People get angry and want something to be done or the subject of their anger punished, it's a fairly normal concept, albeit in this case it's taken way too far and the person clearly takes this way too seriously. \n\nAnd asking other people for reports is almost like asking them to approve of your assessment. If someone reports another player along side of you, then the implication is that they agree with you and believe the other person is in the wrong. There's also plain believing those extra reports hold some weight (it doesn't really), or just personal satisfaction that you persuaded someone to do as you asked, etc etc. I mean, it's not like either of those actions are counter intuitive. \n\nThat being said, neither of those behaviors are promoted.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Telephone Booth","date":"2016-08-29T23:55:15.907+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Asking for reports IS reportable already... idk how it's \"promoted\" other than by the dumb people who do it and then get a chat restriction and come bitch about it on the forums.
