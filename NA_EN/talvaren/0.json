So for anyone who doesn&#039;t know, there is a fellow named SwimyFishy who has given his opinion on the champion&#039;s alignment using the D&amp;D Alignment Chart. Loved it, joined it, gave my own list. Ya see, what I wish we could get for our beloved champions is some STATS. Facts about their physical attributes, their birthdays, and so on. I know I can&#039;t even begin to try to write down their stats. That said, i want to try and give my opinion on what the Ages of these champions are, for who I can guess anyway. Please feel free to join in and give opinions. HONEST opinions please, I&#039;ve seen some people joking around that Annie was 40.  Also for champions that have existed for over LONG periods of time, I will be filling them in with the term &quot;Ancient&quot; for the time being.

(Usually out by a year or two, with a smaller proportion out by a half decade or more).\n\nThe biggest differences I think I see are where you call some champs \"Ancient\" and \"Timeless\" (like the Ascended), I have ages for them.  They were born human, after all, and they can die (even of old age) - it just takes a very long time indeed.  Nasus and Renekton, for example, are pushing a few millennia these days.  Many of the folks associated with the Shadow Isles were also born human before becoming other than alive.  Karthus in particular was born in Noxus after the creation of the Shadow Isles, and journeyed to there via Bilgewater by choice!\n\nYour Nami is quite a bit older than my Nami, though.","replies":[{"poster":"Fasmodey","date":"2017-08-05T17:09:16.276+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"What about Xerath and his aging?

Not wishing for any official answer, just your thoughts.\n\nMy totally-not-official thoughts on the matter is that Xerath is still subject to some 'laws'.  All that magic that he's putting out needs to come from somewhere - and if there were a situation where he weren't able to regain that magic somehow, I think he'd be snuffed out and 'die'.\n\nThat's a lot of 'somewhere' and 'somehows', but that's my thought - that as long as he's still got magic to use, he won't die of old age or whatever.  What I think is interesting is that Xerath has actually spent a surprisingly short amount of time in the real world in his present form.  Maybe not long enough to discover all his weaknesses.","replies":[{"poster":"Fasmodey","date":"2017-08-05T17:25:02.852+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But isn't it something correct for all magical creatures?

They are immortal by my definition, in that they can never die, but their bodies can still be broken, and this process is referred to as death.

The Silmarillion makes it explicitly clear that this not the afterlife, but rather a physical location in the continent of Aman. Elves can sometimes leave Valinor and return to Middle Earth, Glorfindel being the prime example.\nI think the only elf who has ever truly died is Luthien, and she had to ask for special permission from the god of death himself.","replies":[{"poster":"Fasmodey","date":"2017-08-05T14:48:57.930+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Interesting, I did not know that.

Okay in honesty I originally thought {{champion:202}}  was something like 37. A factor I kept in mind is that Riot said, canonically, he is four years older than Zed. I also know this was also a joke, but it was a fact and joke. I felt {{champion:98}}  was 30 and {{champion:238}}  was three years older than him, so {{champion:202}}  was 37. But then some things about the ages people were sayying started to make more sense, till it eventually got to the point {{champion:202}} was 44.

I hope we can get more 15-20 year olds. I automatically like characters closer to my age range more and I need more of them. Don't get me wrong I like Tali, Ekko, and Kayne but for some reason they just aren't doing it for me. Taliyah has the young free spirit, Ekko has the defiant forge your own destiny thing, and Kayne has enough Sasuke-esqe edge to have his own anime, these are all things I like, all well done characters with themes I identify with but I still feel like this age group is underrepresented. To put it in perspective in the 30's-40's age range I count 42 on this list, 19 animal like or animal/human hybrids, 12 Yordles, 6(arguably more, does Jax count?) void champs, and only 3 teens. If you count Urgot and Camille as cyborgs we have 5 cyborgs/robots. League has more robot people than teenagers. \n\nSo, It might be too much to ask because all these young characters are pretty new additions to the lineup, with Kayne being the newest addition, but please Riot could you add some more teenagers?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hovering Hentai","date":"2017-08-05T23:01:32.253+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I remember reading a riot comment saying Swain was only in his 30's or 40's or that that was the general decision the team had come to","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lùmen","date":"2017-08-05T21:45:38.370+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Azir lives for only several thousands of years thanks to the ascension**","replies":[]},{"poster":"Eeyore","date":"2017-08-05T20:42:54.616+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's known that Jinx is older than Vi, by the way.\n\nI believe Camille was stated to be over a hundred too, canonically. \n\nAnd Nami is a \"girl\", in the sense of being a non-adult.

Whales have a compressed lifespan compared to humans, so a 13 year old human would probably be as mature as 9-10 year old whale. Similarly, a 1 year old bird has the same physical maturity of a 16 year old human.
