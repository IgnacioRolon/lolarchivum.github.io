I&#039;ve lost pretty much every games I&#039;ve played except for 1. I usually average 4 or 5 kills on Evelynn (I know it isn&#039;t very good XD, im trying!), but the game I won I got 10. I&#039;m basically here to ask for any advice on how to win more games more often, and jungler mains to give some advice as well (would be greatly appreciated) Also if anyone would want to duo with me to maybe give tips in game and maybe carry me so I can win XD, if so leave names in the comments. Thanks:)","replies":[{"poster":"Muxxik","date":"2018-08-14T04:01:48.871+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are so many dynamics to the game that trying to pick apart what you might be doing wrong (at first there will be hundreds of mistakes per game, I make dozens of mistakes per game and many of which I won't even realize, along with anyone else who posts on this board) would be impossible.  If you want to play a couple of games though I'd be glad to add you and we can do some normals.  I've been playing since season 1, I'm currently Gold, and peaked in Plat 3 when I played more often. :)","replies":[{"poster":"LFlood12","date":"2018-08-14T19:15:04.097+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"LFlood12:)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-08-14T03:53:30.131+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just keep playing. You are extremely new and just need experience.\n\nThere is no secret checklist that will make you not lose when you are inexperienced. Try to play champions that can stay useful when behind: mages, CC tanks, or supports, not assassins or ADCs.","replies":[]}]}
