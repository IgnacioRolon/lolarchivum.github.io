Well I recently got perma-banned after only receiving one 14-day ban. I had zero other warnings. No chat restrictions prior to the 14 day. Very next one is permanent. Tried to point that out in a ticket and they insist I received chat restrictions. Guarantee I did not receive any such thing. And honestly my 14 day ban did scare me enough into reforming. Did I get perfect instantly? No. Did I show signs of wanting to reform? Absolutely. Did Riot care? Sadly, no. I doubt this will accomplish anything, but something obviously needs done with this system when a veteran player who has donated countless hours and a lot of money to this game gets perma banned after only ONE warning.

Since it is a severe disregard for the Summoner’s Code this sort of behavior can result in skipping to a Two week or Permanent suspension. Suspensions of this degree based on negative behavior will not likely be reduced or removed.\n\nI'm happy to hear that your behavior has improved, but the system wants your behavior to be _acceptable_, not just _less unacceptable_ than what you have demonstrated in the past.\n\nYou weren't punished for misbehaving in one game. You were punished for misbehaving in _one more_ game, in a consistent pattern of negative behavior that breaks the game's rules. Additionally, the reform card doesn't always show all the logs that led to your punishment: it randomly selects up to several logs. You might see three logs, but you also might see as few as one, even for players whose punishment stems not from a small number of egregious infractions but rather from dozens of instances of mild toxicity. The purpose of the reform card is to tell you how to reform, so it shows you an example of the behavior that prompted your punishment and explains that such behavior is inappropriate and should be avoided if you want to maintain an account in good standing.\n\nUsually, one transgression by itself wouldn't be enough to bring such a punishment to an otherwise clean account, but the IFS works on an escalating punishment system. Breaking a minor rule, like engaging the team in useless arguments, has a minor punishment: a chat restriction. Breaking that same rule over and over again, however, doesn't prompt an endless series of chat restrictions. The severity of the punishment ramps up over time, because the goal is to eliminate the punished player's willingness to break the game's rules. If two chat restrictions don't stop the useless arguments, the system will increase the punishment to a 14-day suspension and deliver a very clear message that the continued rule-breaking is becoming a serious issue and any further instances will result in a permaban. Again, the point is to put a stop to this misbehavior. If a player is more interested in repeatedly breaking the rules than in maintaining access to their account, they'll lose access to their account.\n\nOf course, it's possible to break major rules, like cheating, threatening people, or using chat for hate speech, and skip punishment tiers so that a clean account ends up with a 14-day suspension or even a permaban.\n\nFrom [Riot's support knowledgebase](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207489286-Instant-Feedback-System-FAQ-):\n\n> **PUNISHMENTS GENERALLY FOLLOW A BASIC ESCALATION PATH:**\n> \n> * First Offense: 10 Game Chat Restriction\n> * Second Offense: 25 Game Chat Restriction\n> * Third Offense: Two Week Suspension\n> * Fourth Offense: Permanent Suspension\n> \n> However, it is possible to skip to a Two Week or Permanent suspension based on the severity of the behavior in the game. Excessive negative behavior can result in a Two-Week or Permanent suspension at any time without having a chat restriction on the account.\n\nYour opinion of the rules is of zero relevance. When a cop stops you for going 40 in a 25 zone, you can claim \"I think the limit should be 45 here\" all you want. You're still getting a ticket. If a librarian asks you to keep your voice down while you use the facilities, shouting that libraries should be loud will simply get you escorted out. If you go to a friend's house who insists that you remove your shoes while you're in their home, \"that's a stupid rule and I do what I want\" will lose you a friend. If you are using someone else's services, facilities, equipment, etc., you abide by their rules or you deal with the consequences. If you think the rules should change, that is a completely different conversation (and I wouldn't give a plugged nickel for your chances at convincing Riot to change their rules to allow behavior like yours).\n\nFrom [Riot's support knowledgebase](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/360024051193-Understanding-Different-Ban-Types-FAQs):\n\n> We work with the overall community and within our own company guidelines to identify what disruptive behavior is and what the consequences for those behaviors should be.
