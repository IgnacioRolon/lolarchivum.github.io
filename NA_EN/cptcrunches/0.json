I was thinking that Riot and the League of Legends community could come together and raise money to help the families of those who were killed or injured in those brutal attacks. Perhaps Riot would make special limited edition skins for Fiora {{champion:114}} and LeBlanc {{champion:7}}, since they both have French accents, and donate all the proceeds to the families who are suffering with medical bills and funeral costs on top of losing loved ones. I&#039;m sure some of those injured or killed were a part of our community, or know someone who is, and I think this would be a great way to show we care and that we stand with France, League player or not.\r\n\r\nIf you agree, please up-vote and hopefully we can grab the attention of a Red and make this happen.","replies":[]}
