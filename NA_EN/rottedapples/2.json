Lamb feels very reserved to me and she's already a beautiful female animal-human hybrid ghost being of a videogame character. I could see Wolf as a little cherubim with Lamb being the person he's trying to get somebody to fall in-love with as if he were Cupid. On the other hand I'd love seeing Lamb in some sort of sun dress, maybe give her some blonde or red fur ( I don't think that we have a red-headed Heartseeker skin yet ) with her bow being a harp that fires a mixture of hearts and musical notes. I think the work they would have to put into this though would make for a very nice 1820 R.P. skin but I think if the skin were done nice I'd buy it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Inphernal","date":"2015-10-15T01:20:33.498+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":8,"body":"Just watch porn so they stop making garbage weaboo skins thanks","replies":[]}]}
