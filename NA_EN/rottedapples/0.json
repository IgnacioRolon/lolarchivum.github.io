Now i just bought 2 rune pages because it was a 2 for 1 deal (still too god damn expensive LUL) because i needed one for something I want to play. I was going to check and see if I did buy the rune page how much IP i would be left with and if i would have enough to buy camille when she comes out. Well when i went and clicked the IP button it purchased them, it didn't tell me how much IP i would have left. I don't really mind, I knew I would have enough to buy camille and I want to take advantage of the rune page sale anyway. But why remove a feature that meant customers didn't have to do math on their own?\r\n\r\nWhy remove convenience?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-08T23:41:20.284+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This feature wasn't removed and you'll find the balances *after purchase* without having to hit any sort of purchase button now after you view an item.
