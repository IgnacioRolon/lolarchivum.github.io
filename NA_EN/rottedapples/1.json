I&#039;m not here to talk about the items in terms of their stats and whatnot but what i did want to give my two cents on was the name changes.\r\n\r\nMost of the name changes are fine. It&#039;s cool to see them given a name that makes them sound like bigger stronger items. I would encourage a little bit more thought/time be put into some of them. Molten edge sounds kinda dumb compared to infinity edge not gonna lie. Circlet of the iron solari almost felt lame compared to locket. I don&#039;t have any suggestions unfortunately, I&#039;m thinking about infinity but nothing yet. I do quite like infernal mask though, it really feels like an upgrade.\r\n\r\nThe name that blew me away though was salvation. Redemption is a nice impactful item and, while i understand these upgrades are strictly stat upgrades from what i&#039;ve seen so far, seeing the name go from what it is now to what i view as a more powerful word, a more powerful version of the item, makes it feel like an amazing upgrade.","replies":[{"poster":"FauxSchizzle","date":"2017-08-09T13:55:06.853+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"You sir, just made Squad5's day.

Unfortunately, our VO pipeline is locked way before the kit is finalized due to our localization process. This is something that would have been implemented if we could have. Who knows, if Ornn ever gets a legendary and we have the actor right there....","replies":[{"poster":"RottedApples","date":"2017-08-09T22:16:01.400+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you do ever managed to get the voice actor in on some skin or some other champion or something that would be cool.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Variks the Loyal","date":"2017-08-09T18:02:36.284+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That makes a lot of sense.
