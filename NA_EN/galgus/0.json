He feels very impotent to me.","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wanted to like Jhin as a carry rewarding careful positioning, but he just feels very impotent to me.\r\n\r\nI&#039;d love to know if I&#039;m missing something or doing something wrong so I can improve with him, so I&#039;d welcome your advice.\r\n\r\nAt the moment he feels like an ADC with a kind of decent harass game, but absolutely no mid or late game potential.\r\n__________________________\r\n\r\nThe one thing about him that feels solid is using his fourth attack to harass and run away before the enemy can retaliate.\r\n\r\nIts feels like a slightly riskier version of Caitlyn&#039;s Headshot stacks, but its still solid.\r\n\r\nCombined with Dancing Grenade he feels like a decent lane bully early, but problems start when any serious fight does.\r\n_________________________\r\n\r\nFirst off, the reload means that starting with the fourth hit in a fight feels crippling to his dps while starting without it seems like a losing proposition against most ADCs.\r\n\r\nEven if they don&#039;t win the fight early with superior burst, I always feel like I need more than four shots to actually kill the ADC unless the Support is contributing some heavy burst damage.\r\n\r\nIt feels like he has inferior burst damage and sustained damage to most ADCs, which makes me wonder what the point of playing him is.\r\n__________________________\r\n\r\nSecond, his abilities seem to have a lot of counter play with very little power in return.\r\n\r\nDancing Grenade can be decent as a minor harass tool, but it feels hopelessly outclassed as a burst tool compared to what most ADCs bring to the table.\r\n\r\nSetting up a minion wave for high damage bounce chains is extremely obvious to any opponent who has played against a Jhin for a few minutes, and yet the damage reward for doing so is barely noticeable.\r\n\r\nDeadly Flourish is a fine ability as a long-range root, and though it isn&#039;t an useful damage tool it does its job well.\r\n\r\nCaptive Audience, on the other hand, feels like complete garbage as anything other than a glorified ward.\r\n\r\nThe slow rarely makes much difference with so many dashes in the game, and anyone remotely paying attention can easily walk out of its radius before it deals damage.\r\n\r\nI&#039;d be fine with this if its damage was actually decent, strong enough to turn the tide of battle and transition a retreat into an attack, but it is not to be.\r\n\r\nIt barely does more damage than a bog-standard auto-attack: most ADC on demand nukes do as much if not more damage than this easily avoided skill that typically must be placed before a fight starts to be effective.\r\n\r\nFinally, his ult feels extremely easy to block or avoid as anyone with a dash while offering only underwhelming damage.\r\n\r\nIts only use seems to be to maybe, maybe pick off someone fleeing from a fight with a sliver of health.\r\n\r\nUsing it anywhere near a fight feels too risky, and using it from a comfortable range ensures that Jhin will be very poorly positioned to help his team when it ends.\r\n_______________________________\r\n\r\nI want to love Jhin, but he seems to have all the weaknesses of an immobile ADC with mediocre utility and damage.\r\n\r\nMaybe I&#039;m building or playing him wrong, maybe I just haven&#039;t seen a Jhin get the gold he needs to succeed yet, but he just feels pointless at the moment.\r\n\r\nAny advice or videos for successful Jhin play you have would be appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"PhantomGG","date":"2016-02-16T11:08:34.874+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"During Lane Phase\n\nYou greatly resemble miss Fortune, if you properly q farm you also can't miss a single minion. frankly i nick name jhin as the marksman yasuo, you rely on early  burst crit, while haveing a q tool that allows you to never miss a single minion. Honestly I feel you want to keep the minions in the middle of the lane so you can maximize your 4th auto attack while also being in a safe place to run from ganks.\n\nQ-A farm tool and a occasional harrass tool\nW-Combo this with your support so you can chain cc to harrass onto the adc or su pport\nE-Use these as if you were teamo so you can protect yourself from ganks\nR-will rarely use during lane phase unless you are kill secureing or helping out a gank\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nGROUP PHASE\n\n\nPicks\n\nYour job is to be a long range sniper, you want to set up plays and picks with your w/e/r, Jhin works best as a pick champion, not so much as a team fight champion, during picks you wanna kill a single target as fast as possible and force in objectives, Jhin plays like his lore, hes a assassin, he wants to find someone, kill them instantly and then push for objectives\n\nIf a team fight happens\n\nInstantly go into your ult, you use your ult like a graves or caitlyn ult, you don't use it to execute, you use it to peel for your front line. With your ult you want to be far back as possible so you can find targets, slow them, harrass, and maybe even kill, this will allow your front line to safely fight the enemy team while you peel and cc for them. Once your ult has finished channeling you want to see if you can snare anyone with your W, after doing this you want to move closer, throw down some bombs, harrass with Q, and then nuke people with your 4 shot passive\n\nDuring Siege\n\nI prefer to insta ult so I can harrass and poke people away from the tower, after that I like to place down some bombs as zoneing tools while throwing down my Q as harrass, If possible I want to use my W as a snare tool to create picks under towers, but my main focus is shooting down the tower with three shots to then try to put the 4th one onto a squishy, reload, repeat the process all over . \n\n\nItemization\nLots of crit","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ultra Combo Ryze","date":"2016-02-16T09:39:36.485+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"BUILD this 2x{{item:3147}} , this 3 Times {{item:3078}}  amd this {{item:3031}} \n\nyou win","replies":[]}]}
