Thats why you play around your team and wait for the knock ups, or yes even use your own knock up. People have just as much reason to hate yasuo players as yasuo players probably tilt because of their team. I normally keep to my own but when you watch a yasuo level 1 dive zed under zeds turret with no minions, die then say \"gg i cant carry its game over\" then essentially run it down mid. We have our reasons for hating the shit out of yasuo players. Still have never met a single yasuo player who was kind or didnt have to be the one 1v9 carrying.\n\nEdit: People seem to really dislike what i have experienced myself, you dont have to believe me or refuse to if it makes you feel better, I dont doubt other people have met nice players, i just have not. If your someone who hates my opinion you can go screw yourself with it for all i care. Don't tell me what i experienced myself because none of you are me. I really have not met any nice yasuo or riven players. On my team or enemy team. Get over it.\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"Stars Shaper","date":"2017-06-18T09:38:11.404+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":3,"body":"Your view is pretty one-sided.\n\nIt's a team game, not helping a team mate or forcing him to wait for you to do something that could be useful for them and limiting their decision making by your own comforts is just stupid.

The first time i played him i did bad, the second time i played him months later i went 20/1.  Don't believe i ever did garbage with him since whenever i have played it. When you can build two items and have 100% crit hes not hard to play what so ever. So i agree hes broken but that does not cloud my judgement what so ever of \"yasuo mains\". Never encountered a friendly one, never encountered one who doesnt feel the need to 1v5 solo carry or the games not worth playing. Just because i think hes broken doesnt mean what ive been saying should be ignored. I guess your right about the windwall thing though, but i never trusted a yasuo player to get stuck in that situation anyways where i would need to depend on him.","replies":[{"poster":"Sraeg2013","date":"2017-06-18T16:06:53.380+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":2,"body":"I remember how I bought Diana and first-timed her in ranked at Platinum 3 level.\nMy question was how come I've won against every single Diana until that point, if I just went 20/3/5.\n\nOr how I tilted, because I got to play support so I picked Rengar and ended up making the enemy bot lane rage quit by going 4/0/4 along my ADC.\n\nAlso how I did a 2v5 penta on my second game of pre-rework Cassiopeia.\n\nAh, that one time I did a quadra with Shen by simply standing in the middle of the team with Sunfire Cape.\n\n---\n\nClearly this anecdotal evidence is enough to deem each and single one of those champions broken.","replies":[{"poster":"Sejeo","date":"2017-06-18T17:18:06.597+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":3,"body":"Yea I got a penta with first time urgot this must mean he is clearly broken and overpowered.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Mira Arya Enthe","date":"2017-06-18T14:38:00.774+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Confirmation bias for the win","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cowseed","date":"2017-06-18T16:30:37.048+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pretty sure those are only the Yasuos you _try_ to remember","replies":[]},{"poster":"Langhof","date":"2017-06-18T21:09:09.467+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"I very highly doubt that in YEARS you've never met a single nice Yasuo main.
