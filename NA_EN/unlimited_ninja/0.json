You won lane 1v2 with no help. You politely repeatedly remind team to use their FREE trinket wards, to just group 4 and hold towers or push enemy towers when they can, and to stay close to baron and dragon when possible to contest them. Get flamed for being \"toxic\" all game, sacrifice yourself constantly to save them, catch them up, set them up for easy win-condition plays (like 4v2 baron force), and get flamed all game. You provide more vision than the rest of your team combined - and you aren't even the support. You risk your neck to set up winning teamfights - sometimes paying for it dearly and getting flamed for a \"shit\" or \"noob\" engage because your team is too chicken to follow up on forcing a 5v4 when the enemy has it's fed jg or adc halfways across the map with no tp. By the time they commit, the enemy is grouped as 5. And post-game even though you carried your sub-par or feeding teammates to victory all game long, you get 0 honors - because \"toxic\". Gosh, sorry I ask you guys to stop splitting off, group up and do your damn job as a 4 man unit since every time you split, you get picked off or baited into bad fights. Sorry I ask you to ward the map so we can see where the enemy is. I didn't realize that was so toxic of me to do. And this is why I hate the honor system - because you get people like that on your team the majority of games and even though only 2 people on your team deserve honor (you and the one other teammate who stopped tilting because you marshalled the troops and got them doing smart plays instead of running around like headless chickens) neither one of you gets 3 honors - you don't even get 1 honor.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"RainXBlade","date":"2017-07-06T05:00:39.394+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I got honored once for being Tilt-Proof, and I wasn't even tilted!\nSo here you go, have a free upvote.\nhttp://4.bp.blogspot.com/-3PZhBqkbF6U/UExreutG4cI/AAAAAAAACu4/iIiTVLroxNA/s1600/patrick-bateman-upvote.jpg","replies":[]},{"poster":"FireDrizzle","date":"2017-07-05T14:21:19.967+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://cdn.meme.am/images/600x600/14447260/veins-popping.jpg","replies":[]},{"poster":"PaladinNO","date":"2017-07-05T12:08:56.569+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://image.slidesharecdn.com/imuk14final-140707114028-phpapp02/95/in-digital-space-no-one-can-hear-you-scream-41-638.jpg?cb=1429849880","replies":[]},{"poster":"Scrinnid","date":"2017-07-05T12:04:30.246+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"That moment when the guy who singlehandedly carried the game while wishing death and cancer to everyone gets 3 honors for tilt proof while i report him for flame xd","replies":[{"poster":"PaladinNO","date":"2017-07-06T20:20:21.386+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Luckily, honours have no impact on a flame report - or so we're told.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MyRivenAccount","date":"2017-07-05T05:35:30.550+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"when I get tripled honored for being tilt proof as I rage at my team intent feeding as I go being so done with their shit","replies":[]},{"poster":"Torterra62","date":"2017-07-05T02:19:48.073+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"that was literally my last game against this terd twitch jg","replies":[{"poster":"Yadid","date":"2017-07-05T02:31:50.086+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"boi. me rn.
