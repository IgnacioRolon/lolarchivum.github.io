I forgot the email and have been trying to change it to my primary email. It will not work and it’s extremely frustrating because of the amount of money and time I’ve spent on my league account.

If you're just trying to update the email on your account, they should be able to get that done after verifying yourself as the creator of the account.","replies":[{"poster":"FLYingINSANE","date":"2017-12-19T04:59:24.139+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you so much.
