After i relogged i now have to wait 5 minutes. because i 'dodged' the game (even though someone else did and i was stuck in the lobby from it...) is this a problem with a solution found? cause i don't want to go through the usual blind pick position fights to have someone dodge and get penalized because i'm stuck in the lobby again... Perhaps i should've closed it through task manager but im sure the app would find out otherwise all REAL dodgers would just end through task manager.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-21T15:20:36.844+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like someone might have tried to play a ruse on yo by mimicking a system message.    Blind pick can certainly be a gamble as it's not as organized as Draft pick.  We aren't able to remove a queue dodge timer, but you may want to try that mode for a bit more organization.  \n\nTo be safe, I also recommend doing a custom game before queuing up for matchmaking to make sure this wasn't caused by any connection sync issues.","replies":[]},{"poster":"l Gashbash l","date":"2017-09-22T17:37:10.576+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"With the ruse thing, I don't think that's possible because I had gotten the  pop-up message when I created a lobby and was told to wait 5 minutes which matched the timer where the usual play button is. \n\nI appreciate the suggestion of draft, but in my experiences of it they haven't been the best and only slightly better when with a friend. It probably is because usually I am looking to play league casually, and typically don't care where I go or if I win. Don't even care if a ww goes adc (which i've seen and they were the first to win lane surprisingly), as I want to just play league and will usually just go with the flow. Again I appreciate the suggestion but it just isn't for me as I usually go blind or ranked.\n\nI don't think it had anything to do with sync too because I had played a game before and after this with no problem and this incident had occurred between those which is why it was confusing to me as to how it had happend in the first place. I mean after playing league since I think mid last season this is the first time this had happend to me so if it's on that rare of an occasion then I don't think I will mind.\n\nI appreciate the help and hope you have a good one.","replies":[]}]}
