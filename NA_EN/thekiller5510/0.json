I got kicked out of the match for afk and my team won. I got 0 ip, I didnt remember at that moment I had first win of the day ip bonus. I went and play a normal and we won, but I got 96 ip. I dont want to start being annoying for that but it annoyed me alot. So could you, dear Riot Games, make it so if you are afk or you left etc you wont lose the ip bonus. pls do that. thank\r\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-08-22T16:42:02.365+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry to hear about the leave here, it may be the culprit in this case.  :(  Leaving or disconnected triggers the cooldown for First Win of the Day. per the [IP Breakdown](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752824-Reward-IP-XP-System-Breakdown#h5) guide.
