I mean they give more stats more gold and drop more often (because if she hits an enemy twice she gets a stack). So like.... why? \n\nI dont think its op its 3 fucking gold but like where in the design process of her passive where they like \"sennas passive needs to drop gold when it gives Crit, range, AD, and lifesteal because her other 4 ability's are so much weaker then threshes\".\n\nMeanwhile with thresh passive its like \"here have .75 ap and armor and your only allowed to get them from stuff dying near you nothing else try not to die hehe\".

Defense items by default are better than offensive ones, given CC exists, base damage is high and all damage is 0 when youre dead. \n\nOffensive items outscale defensive ones so defense doesnt get out of hand later, but the general rule is the same. It doesnt matter how much damage you do when you are CCd or dead, and a proper teamcomp will have numerous ways to deal with someone who has amassed a lead for themselves with proper play.\n\nThere is a reason why your team invests so much into protecting the one person on your team who builds damage. Its not because ADCs are amazing at teamfights, theyre pretty garbage at it, and your team has to put a lot of its cost into keeping them alive. Its because you need someone to damage objectives, which takes offensive power to do quickly.\n\nIf objectives werent that hard to take, ADCs would be useless and no one would run them. Youd also never see more than 1 or 2 offensive items. Theres no need to take that risk when defensive items are just far more effective.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"YaraOwO","date":"2020-02-17T03:16:55.629+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So because she deals more damage then thresh she gets more gold..... i don't get it.","replies":[{"poster":"chipndip1","date":"2020-02-17T04:38:30.056+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=YaraOwO,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=vZHcpbrf,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2020-02-17T03:16:55.629+0000)\n>\n> So because she deals more damage then thresh she gets more gold..... i don't get it.\n\nMarksman items cost more, so the 3 gold helps her itemize.
