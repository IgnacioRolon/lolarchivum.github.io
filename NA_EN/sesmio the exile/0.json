Since the store heavily relies on Internet Explorer settings, certain security settings within IE can cause problems.

My guess is the server is down/ on mantainance or soemthing like that. I want to purchase rp with my debit card but when I press the rp button the window pops up but it never leaves the loading state now matter how many times I try. One time it did go through but it got stuck on the 3rd step. My best guess it will fix itself later. I would wait a couple of hours and then contact support directly if nothing changes","replies":[]}]}
