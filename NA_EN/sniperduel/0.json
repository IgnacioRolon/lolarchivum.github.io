Some examples I do the MOST damage, kills, least deaths, most minion kills 12/1/3 and get B+, also I had a game where I am 36/2/6  tons of damage tons of minion kills (like 200?) and get an A. Just wondering if something is going wrong or something with my account and if some of you are experiencing the same issues. Maybe some of u can help me or provide me with some answers to what I am doing wrong to get a precious S. And yes I am playing PvP :)\r\n\r\nSniperduel","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-17T22:44:49.906+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mileage will vary depending on other players in the region playing the same champ and role.
