Usually after I click Retry, it shows the splash screen and I load into the game with everyone else. Occasionally though (Once every 20 games) it'll take too long to pop up with the Unable to connect and everyone will have already loaded in game. By the time I get into game (2:45 or later) the remake vote pops up and they vote to remake the game. I'm trying to figure out some kind of solution as this started happening a long time ago.\r\n\r\nOnce I get into game I have no problems BTW, I don't disconnect and my ping is stable. Also recently (About 2 patches ago) the problem has gotten slightly worse because it won't pop up with the champ splash screen at all sometimes and just stays a black screen till I get into game. I feel like I might have a screwed up installation but not sure. I tried verifying all the files but nothing changed. I'm wondering are there any connection setting files or something I can reset?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-02T20:47:15.941+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Black screens like these that you see usually indicate a network problem failing to establish a connection with the server.

This doesn't happen on my laptop so I don't understand why it would be a connection issue. I did try troubleshooting using the ideas in the link but nothing helped. I just reinstalled the game but the issue still remains. It's not that I can't connect, it's just an initial black screen for about 10 seconds followed by unable to connect. I press retry and it immediately loads me into game most of the time. I'm still wondering why it does this though. I don't have anything else running on this computer and even disabled anti-virus shields just in case that was causing an issue. ","replies":[]}]}]}
