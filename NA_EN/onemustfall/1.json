This happens commonly when I'm in Champ Select so sometimes I can't even see what champion I'm picking or I can't change masteries/runes so I end up going into the game with the wrong stuff. I can't seem to figure out what the problem could be. I have tried doing a full repair to no avail. This only happens with this game and only with the LOL Client itself and not in game. Any help here would be appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"Souluus","date":"2018-01-06T02:30:57.473+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have the same issue.

Sometimes they reappear if I move my mouse over the area, sometimes it doesn't though. Lately I've just been restarting the client when it happens and that fixes it for a little while sometimes but it seems to be quite random. Never had the issue with the Legacy Client...","replies":[{"poster":"LostFr0st","date":"2017-10-18T19:05:49.823+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know it appeared on Legacy too, but the boxes were larger since the client had less components.\n\n>Sometimes they reappear if I move my mouse over the area, sometimes it doesn't though.\n\nYes, this^\n\nIdk what it is either; very random.\nHopefully if people keep reporting it we'll be able to find a pattern.\n\nDid it always happen for you when adjusting Runes/Masteries or also when you just get into select?  Asking since for me I was sitting in Collection editing runes.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-18T18:15:48.124+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry to hear about these black screens.  :(  It can happen from either connection problems that can't download assets, or a problem with game files failing to render.
