Is there a known bug, that causes that? I don't feel like rebuying skins, and I got no response to another post i made, asking if there is a way to check my entire purchase history, so i can verify my opinion on a potential bug?","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2019-02-16T07:08:23.693+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey! \n\nFor something like this, I'd suggest hitting up [Riot Support via ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new). They'll have access to your account and can tell you if any changes have been made to your account. The only reason I can think of off the top of my head as to why content would be removed is if you made a purchase/someone gifted you content, and there was a chargeback on the purchase. In that scenario, the purchase is refunded and the content is removed from the account. Again, support will know a bit more about this kind of thing. ^-^","replies":[{"poster":"ZestyZilean","date":"2019-03-01T09:42:10.497+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"K, thanks for the help","replies":[]}]}]}
