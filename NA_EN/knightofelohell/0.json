Vandiril has a video on YouTube showing a ton of champion interactions with Morde ult, where even some abilities just don't do damage.\n\nIn my opinion, Riot should have made Morde's ult a little more akin to Jarvan's ult with really cool graphics, not this whole \"death realm\" thing. It's causing way too many buggy interactions. For example, if Nunu channels his ult near the beginning or end of Morde's ult, it doesn't deal damage to the realm Nunu is in. Vandiril didn't show if Nunu's ult still dealt damage in the real world after Morde takes him to the shadow realm, though. This and a plethora of other abilities should follow the caster into the Death Realm, which actually causes a huge programming challenge, ergo the simpler \"Jarvan-esque\" ult programming.\n\nA channel time sounds like a good way to balance a lot of these issues, too. If Morde begins to channel his ult on a Fiora with her W up, she'll block it. (Because magic sword? Science?) That seems to me a good amount of counterplay for such a strong ultimate. However, once you're in, nothing should be able to take you out besides winning the duel or dying.","replies":[{"poster":"WEREW0LF","date":"2019-06-14T04:11:36.870+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"right before reading this I was thinking this.

Debuff cleansing shouldn't, because the debuff is separate from the duel: losing 10% stats is a debuff. Being in the death realm isn't.\n\nAlso, fix his interaction with {{champion:203}}. Wolf shouldn't count as a pet, especially when you don't summon him, you just set targets(such as with w or e3). It feels stupid to not be able to use half of my kit because of an interaction that shouldn't exist. Especially considering that Wolf counts as the same sort of \"part of the champion\" thing Willump does, and that's not nullified by his ult.\n\nWorst part of that is if you consider Kindred's kit, they should actually be a counter to Morde, but Morde counters you solely because wolf doesn't enter the  death realm, even though he should, especially as not being in the map should count as leaving w area, thus summoning him to death realm.","replies":[{"poster":"WEREW0LF","date":"2019-06-14T04:02:45.355+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"wow thats wild. so while we all see kindred as '2' champions they are controlled by 1 person. so you literally get your character cut in half... that, yea, bullshit.

Some things that dont even travel in the air (like a wave) are stopped by it, I am not sure but it may even stop a Kalista champion toss. It is pretty broken. It also stops things that are not projectiles in a classic sense, but like Jinx chompers being thrown. \n\nOlafs ult makes him immune to all cc right but Zacs now old, but new, pancake ult could pick him up and move him entirely while in an ult. \n\nPyke is super broken in this way.

Its the only ability in the game I can think of that has a wind up and still goes off regardless of interactions. \n\nThere are also examples of the other way around like Zeds ult, you click R, you click a guy.
