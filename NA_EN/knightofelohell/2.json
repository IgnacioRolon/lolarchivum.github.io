The list is up to right under 310, up from 250 last season. I&#039;m not making this up.\r\n\r\nThe ONE bug that is good to him, that allows him to get max sheild with one E, which mind you, still decays and only could happen below 40% hp, was hot fixed in LESS THAN ONE DAY!!\r\n\r\n yet, the literal hundreds of bugs like 3rd Q or any ability doing absolutely ZERO damage(literally) to minions, champions, large monsters, and everything you can damage is REFUSED to be fixed &quot;because we are waiting for his rework&quot;\r\n\r\n&quot;Waiting for a rework&quot; did not stop this bug from being fixed asap.\r\n Some other easy Morde bugs:\r\n-doing 0 damage with Q when W pops(causes you to lose 1 v1s and team fights that should have been won)\r\n\r\n-making Poppys ult do nothing when I have w up and ult her(not fair to enemy Poppy, like this Revitalize bug wasn&#039;t fair to enemies)\r\n\r\n-Protobelt active making Morde&#039;s w invisible if it pops anytime close to after you protodash to myself and every ally AND enemy on the locked screen(unfair to the Morde player, allies, and enemies)\r\n\r\n-ILL KEEP GETTING JHIN GHOST HITTING 4TH SHOTS FOREVER, also OP and oppressive\r\n\r\n-Having Darius&#039;s passive ignoring my sheilds completely(unfair to the Morde)\r\n\r\n-Gunblade not healing fully on Q because it&#039;s still coded as AoE, tho I&#039;m pretty sure that is done intentionally because of it&#039;s high damage output\r\n\r\nThis is just a very, very small list of game changing bugs that is problematic playing Morde, so why not address the other common bugs as well?\r\n\r\n#NolovefortheHuehue\r\n\r\nMordekiaser es numero uno","replies":[]}
