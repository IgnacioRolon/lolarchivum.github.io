Were all Ascended great warriors who specialised in some form of weapon? Seems a weird requirement.\n\nOne concept I have is a Darkin who is basically trapped in a large stick because it was near them at the time as they were a mage, no weapon needed. No 'weapon' to trap so people tricked them into picking up a stick and were trapped in that. (Of course the concept is a meat shield bruiser support with healing based on the host).","replies":[{"poster":"Fasmodey","date":"2019-08-16T14:47:30.360+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Through secrecy and cunning artifice, the physical forms of the Ascended could be merged with the celestial power in their hearts, and all of it bound within the weapons they bore.\n\nThey are imprisoned in their own weapon.\n\nAnd tbh, I would expect the strongest ones to wield weapons.

If you ask me magic is usually a far better combat tool in general. So, how would they imprison a more magic-oriented Darkin?\nIf you ask me, I think that even those Darkins/Ascended had a weapon of some sorts. Maybe an artefact-weapon like a gauntlet with Horok's case, or a staff or some other thing like that","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"AbiwonKenabi","date":"2019-08-16T14:14:30.075+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Maybe a staff for a mage.
