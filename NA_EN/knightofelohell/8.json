Than Rylias and Liandries with a Portobello and sudden impact rune... OP, prepare for new shots and OP ghosts","replies":[]},{"poster":"PhearBunny","date":"2018-03-24T16:59:51.982+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hydra is pretty huge waste of 3500gold on Morde.\nChamps only go hydra for wave clear, Morde already has wave clear.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kelg","date":"2018-03-24T16:18:29.665+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Steraks + Triforce is decent on him. hydra not so much","replies":[]}]}
