I opened it and got Medieval Twitch, a skin that I wanted for a long time. I also had 2 keys so I went to buy 2 crates from the shop and I opened them. Now the Twitch skin is missing from my Loot menu!! I still have my 2 other rewards.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-21T21:46:00.835+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That Twitch skin from the capsule would have been permanent! You don't need to actually use essence to redeem them, so check your collection for that skin!","replies":[]}]}
