This problem persists regardless of game mode or graphics settings. Does anyone have any ideas as to what may be causing it or what I can do to fix it?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-15T01:06:44.474+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmm you mentioned a Windows update as well? I do know that a lot of people have had problems with the XBox Game DVR being automatically turned back on after updates, so check for that and turn it back off if so as it can cause these frame stutters sometimes. \n\nLet me know if that doesn't help!","replies":[]}]}
