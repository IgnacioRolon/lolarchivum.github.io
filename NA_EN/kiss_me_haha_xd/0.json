League has always been a big passion of mine for a VERY long time. My college hosted try-outs for league of legands e sports at my school today, and I had an awful experience. Out of a 8 hour period I was only given the oppertunity to play in two games out of 17 other people who played 4 on average. I was told that I was lucky to even play the second game because one of the other coaches wanted to put me in. I was one of two females there, and not to sound like I'm feminist or anything but I feel like I was completely discriminated against. The coach was practically laughing at me when I begged to play more games and show what I had only to be shot down. I want to know if there is anyone willing to coach me or take me in as a support in a diamond or higher team. I have a burning passion inside of me to go further in league, and after today I'm feeling completely defeated. If anyone is willing to give me a chance to improve or join their team, please reach out to me and add me. Thanks for reading.","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-08-31T23:52:35.543+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is it possible that your experience was due to something other than your gender? As examples - just guessing here, because you gave us no actual information (did anyone say why you weren't placed into more matches? what happened to the other female applicant? etc.) - it could have been related to your behavior or in-game performance. I assume you're not posting on your main, as you're trying to get into a Diamond team but this account is not yet 30.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheUrbanKitsune","date":"2019-08-31T23:29:10.805+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, fellow female diamond support player here.\nI played for my college's A team last year and I'm trying out again this year as well.\n\nFrom the way you explained things it sounds like there could possibly be one of a few situations going on here--\nWhat is the average rank of the players trying out? If you were already in the top of the ranks for players it makes sense to give you less play time since you're basically already a shoe-in.\nIf that's not the case then it seems like the coaches were being a bit rude and unprofessional and I'm sorry you have to go through that.\n\nI'm not really in a position to be able to play regularly with another team to try and help you out since I have my own college team to worry about right now, but I could share some of the advice my coach has given me in the past if you think it would help.","replies":[{"poster":"kiss me haha XD","date":"2019-08-31T23:44:29.716+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, thanks for your reply. All ranks were plat-diamond. Like I said in the post, there for sure was one  player who seemed to play better than me but at the same time I wasn't given the same oppertunity as them. They had played 3 games before I ever got my second game in, it was the supp from their last season.","replies":[]},{"poster":"kiss me haha XD","date":"2019-08-31T23:35:27.751+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":".","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"III BAKURYU III ","date":"2019-08-31T23:03:26.543+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hello, Silver 2 Season 6 player here:\n\nHave you thought about starting up a youtube or stream channel?  Gain popularity for the **RIGHT** reasons(gameplay) and form a team that fits around **YOUR** style of play.  Fans of your steam/channel will want to play with you and follow your lead.  \nYou can form a team with your fellow peers that will be willing to listen and are similar to your style of play or they wouldn't be watching your stream in the first place. \n\nI think it's understandable about _why_ the coach laughed about putting you in the game.  However, you say you are Plat/Diamond, right?  Well you are already better than like 50+% of the community so no reason to feel down.  \n\nI don't think you really need to be _coached_ as it's really not necessary, honestly.  Just stay calm in game, and not tilt are the two factors that more or less determines on who wins or loses but neither can be \"coached\".","replies":[]},{"poster":"LordBastille","date":"2019-09-05T00:18:28.134+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey devine cheese, \n\nSorry to hear how you were treated at the tryout, it seems like it was an awful experience. I'm sure you will find interest in the ABL, we also don't allow discrimination so you won't have to worry about that.\n\nCome say hi! https://discord.gg/zAcjgJR","replies":[]},{"poster":"Oleandervine","date":"2019-09-04T15:00:39.514+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not terribly sure why you're making such a large point about being a female. If you got the skills, that should speak for itself. Bringing up that you're a girl repeatedly sounds like you're trying to play some kind of angle here, and not actually find a team that will take you for your skills. Hell, you don't even have to tell people you're a girl, just apply for teams you want to be on, do kickass in their tryout games and show off your skills to them, and then be happy if they accept you on their team. \nIf you're a girl, so fucking what? Your skills in the game are 100% unrelated to the body that houses your brain (unless you're missing fingers and can't use a mouse or keyboard).\n\nAdditionally, if you got discriminated against at your college tryouts, that's something to take up with whoever is in charge of that, not here on the Boards. The Boards can do absolutely nothing in regards to the activities of your college's e-sport leadership.","replies":[]},{"poster":"IncrediPhiLL","date":"2019-09-04T14:45:23.630+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Any reason why you aren't posting from your main account?
