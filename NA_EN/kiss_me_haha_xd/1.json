League has always been a big passion of mine for a VERY long time. My college hosted try-outs for league of legands e sports at my school today, and I had an awful experience. Out of a 8 hour period I was only given the oppertunity to play in two games out of 17 other people who played 4 on average. I was told that I was lucky to even play the second game because one of the other coaches wanted to put me in. I was one of two females there, and not to sound like I'm feminist or anything but I feel like I was completely discriminated against. The coach was practically laughing at me when I begged to play more games and show what I had only to be shot down. I want to know if there is anyone willing to coach me or take me in as a support in a diamond or higher team. I have a burning passion inside of me to go further in league, and after today I'm feeling completely defeated. If anyone is willing to give me a chance to improve or join their team, please reach out to me and add me. Thanks for reading.","replies":[]}
