This is my main account (EUW), but I do have another account on NA that I used to use to play with some of my friends. The username is EDITED:DO NOT SHARE USERNAMES (Amy Ki is the IGN). For some reason, I can't seem to find my account anywhere! When I tried logging in, it said that my account had been transferred to another region. I proceeded to try out each region, yet couldn't find my account anywhere. So I was wondering what happened with it. Could it be possible to get my account back on NA, as I actually paid to have it transferred from EUW to NA a long time ago? I was able to receive emails related to said account and even change my password. I don't know what went wrong.\n\nThank you very much for your time and patience!","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-24T03:28:09.283+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I checked up on this for you, and this account hasn't ever been transferred to any region.
