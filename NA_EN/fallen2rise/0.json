I have a new account and received my first loot box. Upon opening it I got a champion \"Jayce\" and the option says upgrade to permanent with no charge. Is this a mistake? Is it just the first champion free to make permanent? Or are all champions from loot boxes now free to make permanent?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-10T21:38:34.314+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That first lootbox is a special one for new players!
