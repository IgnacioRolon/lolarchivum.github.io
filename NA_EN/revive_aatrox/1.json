Possible NERF /Bug fixed","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This may seem weird cause its hard for me to explain but but take example of blade of the ruined king. It gives 40% As. this attack speed is based of base attack speed which vary from champion to champion. Lets take tryndamere  as example. 0.67. 40% of .67 is .268 so  0.938. plus  49% from levels at level 18.  so 0.67*49% =0.32 for a total of  1.26 level 18 tryndamere with a blade of the ruined king. Nasus with a frozen heart and is W will bring you down by 50% of total attack speed which means 1.26/2 = .63 As... which is lower then base stat. You just wasted 18 level of stats and a full item with one spell and one item. \r\n\r\nIn my humble opinion Nasus W and Frozen heart should be calculated on base As just like As items.  So in this case 50% of .67 =0.33 so attack speed debuff should bring you too 1.26-.33 = .93  on this ist not that much of a difference. But take an example where you up at 2.0 attack speed.  50% attack speed reduction brings you to 1.0 attack speed but if you calculate it on base attack speed you&#039;ll get 2.00-.33 = 1.77 Wich is a huge difference..Considering some champion are meant to build Attack speed as they lack other source of damage Nasus is just a strait up counter and str8 up toxic to play agaisnt for any attack speed reliant champion. Considering there&#039;s a 1.5 second where nasus cant debuff you once W is maxed out and 45% cdr is reached is almost a perma debuff. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion The more attack speed you buy, the more gold your throwing away\r\nAnd with that said i&#039;d just like to remind you all that they nerfed Aatrox in patch 3.13 with this line as an explication: Any champion can be frustrating to play against when they&rsquo;re capable of building very tanky while still outputting considerable DPS, so we&#039;re lowering some of Aatrox&rsquo;s innate damage. With this change, Aatrox must build items for damage and won&rsquo;t be able to simultaneously tank and smash face as easily.  ( I just wish they could be smart about it and realise Nasus is exactly like that and very frustrating to play against) \r\n\r\nP.S 1  Tryndamere mocking shout got a 80 AD debuff on a 14 second cool down lasting 4 second  , but tryndamere isnt really rewarded like nasus for stacking 45% cooldown reduction, this shit is still toxic and part of a very outdated mechanic when they just didnt know what to give to champion as abilities and gave them debuff. \r\n\r\nP.S 2 Fiora as an Attack speed debuff of 50% on her parry too  it only last 1,5 second but it is also base of total attack speed and not base attack speed.\r\n\r\nP.S 3  Malphite gotta have one of the worst of all a 50% attack speed debuff  for 3 second on a 3.85 second cool down once 45% cdr is attained. Combine with frozen heart 65 % Total As reduction.

He used to have 35 to 95% attack speed slow at max rank now it's just 17.5 to 47.5% (so basically 32.5% average at max rank), I mean it's ridiculous to complain about his attack speed slow right now. Also it makes no sense to have a slow on base attack speed, since it is after all supposed to counter attack speed based champions and people that buy a lot of attackspeed.\n\nAttack speed slowing is actually one of the rare somewhat healthy counters we have to ad carries/melee carries and if you actually look closer it's been removed on a lot of champions for obscure reasons (#all hail the adc overlords?)\nGragas, Lee Sin used to have AS slows. Frozen Heart AS slow was nerfed. Nasus AS slow was butchered.\n\nNasus identity was one of a counter to autoattackers, and it is not the case anymore. He's actually bad in teamfights because his slow isn't as good as he was (at least before he had a purpose of denying a carry dps)","replies":[{"poster":"Atanchan","date":"2016-07-14T10:57:43.239+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I imagine the reason why all those slows used to have AS components was literally because \"that's how DOTA does it,\" similar to a lot of early design decisions due to it being the only other game in the genre to base this stuff on. Later, though, Riot realized that attack speed slows add a _ton_ of pretty hidden power into an ability, and decided that an ability should only have one if that's an actual defining part of it.\n\nFrankly, I think it makes sense. Attack speed slows are practically weaker blinds and should really be treated as those and silences. Unlike those two, they don't completely kill the champion type they counter's ability to contribute, but the effect can be _incredibly_ stronger than those on the player - after all, it forces the player to suddenly adapt to a new autoattack rhythm in the middle of a fight which can actually result in a blind-level effect depending on the player, but even less extreme cases will still pretty heavily destroy their kiting pattern.\n\nAnd considering how much of a deal attack animation is to the feel of play, it's really no surprise that something unpredictable that alters it is really not something Riot wants be common; after all, they want you to be fighting the enemy team, not the controls.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Atanchan","date":"2016-07-14T09:50:56.172+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because movement speed slows are also based on total movement speed.","replies":[{"poster":"Revive Aatrox","date":"2016-07-14T09:58:40.226+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Which is a good example of double standars","replies":[{"poster":"Atanchan","date":"2016-07-14T10:49:20.958+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"... uhhhh?\n\nA double standard is when two similar things are treated differently for arbitrary reasons.\n\nI'm not entirely sure how slows acting exactly the same makes for them being treated differently.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2016-07-14T09:49:04.511+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's already plenty of counter to Nasus's Wither for adc.

Aatrox is also just kinda terrible atm.\n\nOverall, attack speed slows would be near useless if they weren't based on total attack speed.  You gave a perfect example of that in fact.  Reducing an enemy's attack speed from 2.0 to 1.67 (not 1.77 btw) is fairly insignificant.  Attack speed slows are supposed to counter attack speed builds, not the other way around.","replies":[{"poster":"Revive Aatrox","date":"2016-07-14T09:56:18.611+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So one ability and one item can counter and entire build.
