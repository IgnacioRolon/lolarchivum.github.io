An opposite way of getting URF without all the bonus would be FULL BUILD BRAWL. (FBB)\r\n\r\nBefore you dismiss the idea with the back of your hand pointing obvious flaws like why would I farm if I'm already full build? (Quick answer: you are still level 1 so you need exp) \r\n\r\nLet just say you would start the game with X amount of gold, I think with 20K you could get all the dream builds you want with it.\r\nThis would be a fun experience, as you would be able to appreciate lots of build diversity, lots of different strategies and it would be really focusing on what items DO, and what champions can do with a full build! \r\n\r\nUnlike urf, where the game focused on having lots of abilities, FBB focus on having all your items at level 1 giving you opportunity that couldn't be allowed during a regular laning phase, opening champions in a whole new way. \r\n\r\nI don't know, this is such an easy way to make a new game mode I wonder what would refrain Riot to explore the idea. \r\n\r\n''It's not laziness if it's a simple idea as long as it's well-executed.''","replies":[{"poster":"Lovelle","date":"2019-12-31T17:42:35.793+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That was basically Dominion and Ascension. You started out at level 3 and reached full build in 10-15 minutes. They were fast and fun, and Riot hates people actually having fun, which is why they were removed.\n\nI don't know about a mode that starts you out at full build though. That gives hard scaling champs and supports way too much of an advantage, while champs with stacking mechanics would be completely useless.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Saevum","date":"2019-12-31T09:11:29.064+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"i would like a 4fun spaguetti gamemode: only tanks.\n\nThink about it. We would get to farm, buy stuff, build up, no adc's, no juggers, no duelist or hypercarry bs. Just a tank aram. Long fights, regen strats, grievous wounds strats, dive em all 24/7 and perma cc chains.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rewt","date":"2019-12-30T23:54:57.396+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"here is the problem. For most Mid Lane champions they dont build HP. they rely on their level 18 health and resist scalings. A level 1 champion getting blasted by a level 1 viegar with 6 items is going to die in 1 Q.","replies":[{"poster":"lunarcana","date":"2019-12-31T00:15:15.134+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i'm not sure but i think he's implying that you basically get level 18 with everything maxed out except maybe stacking","replies":[{"poster":"Revive Aatrox","date":"2019-12-31T00:32:53.233+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Nah start level 1, buy stuff strategicaly, bans veigar if he's too op, whatever, don't say no just for saying no. Morelo liandry roa arch angel ( both getting bought maxed for maybe a higher price ? ) would make you rather beefy for level 1.\n\nYou never try pratice mode you go full build level just for the lols, well imagine that, but with people. Thats pretty much all. You could probably get turret really quick. ETC. But man would be a fast pace exciting way to not be urf yet feeling faster pace and exciting. \n\nPlus: LOTS of new player don't know the items, what they do and aren't really encourrage to read them through normal game play. In a game mode where it's all about items, YOU HAVE TO read the items and understand what they do, you can't blindly build anymore. You'll ask your self why 6 rabadon wasn't good cause 30 flat pen was actually a better choice.","replies":[{"poster":"FSRER","date":"2019-12-31T10:11:50.158+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If players could pick what champions they wanted this gamemode would be awful\n{{champion:51}} {{champion:21}} {{champion:99}} {{champion:35}} {{champion:126}} {{champion:30}} {{champion:143}} \n{{champion:119}} {{champion:11}} {{champion:222}} {{champion:102}} {{champion:101}} {{champion:238}} {{champion:412}} \n{{champion:105}} {{champion:76}} {{champion:13}} {{champion:202}} {{champion:523}} {{champion:26}} {{champion:8}} \nAll these would be perma picks and would ruin the gamemode of everyone","replies":[]},{"poster":"Z3SIeeper","date":"2019-12-31T00:51:21.077+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"One or more of your 6 items can be MR lol.\n\nOr Zhonya which can be used to negate his ult completely.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Optifreak72","date":"2019-12-31T00:21:48.511+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Some champs are powerful early others dominate late.
