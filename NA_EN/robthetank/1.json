I&#039;ve been playing League for years now and I&#039;ve racked-up lots of IP and Runes and Mastery Points and Wins. When I first started playing, my friends kind-of implied that each time you reach a game that could be a thousandth win, the game automatically matches you with Riot employees as a reward for reaching that x,000th Normal Win.\n\nTurns out that automatic matching isn&#039;t the case as my 1,000th win already came and went with no Riot employees on either team. Apparently you actually have to _ask_ Riot employees to join you. So I&#039;m asking here.\n\nAt the time of this post, I&#039;m at 1,984 Normal wins. I know its early but I think I might reach 2,000 in a week or two. I main Support. Especially good old {{champion:53}}.\n\nI would be honored if a Riot employee / player was my ADC during the game that could be my 2,000th win. {{champion:222}}  / {{champion:67}} I've found work best with Blitz.","replies":[]}
