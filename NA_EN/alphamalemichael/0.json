Balance isn't exciting. Irelia murdering everyone is exciting. Akali being untouchable until her team loses is exciting. Sylas having five different random ults every match is exciting. Rengar deleting someone is exciting. Whenever someone buys a skin or a Worlds passes, that sends a message to Riot that they're doing it right. Riot is a business and it _owns_ LoL.
