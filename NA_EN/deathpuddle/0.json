It's so rare to play a game that is not decided before 15 minutes that I forget the last time I did. \r\n\r\nWhen I hit that solo button it literally feels like I just pulled the lever on a slot machine.","replies":[{"poster":"Shiroi Kitsune","date":"2015-08-17T00:52:54.111+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"That point is when you stop \"feeling like you have zero impact\".","replies":[{"poster":"DeathPuddle","date":"2015-08-17T00:56:14.513+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's what I'm asking btw.

Once you start actually having a serious impact in your games, that's when it stops being a coin flip.  If you are satisfied with mediocracy, than you won't be anything above average.  And if you are just average, games will literally be nothing but a proverbial coin toss.  Once you start actively impacting the way the game is going (Making calls, taking risks, etc.) you will find that games will stop feeling like they are decided at 15 minutes.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sona Ping","date":"2015-08-17T01:12:01.505+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He means \"When you start doing things to have an impact on your own games.\"","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Wade Funk","date":"2015-08-17T00:52:07.913+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"High diamond/Challenger and even then it still happens but a lot less often. \n\nIt's always funny to hear people say \"If you're in Bronze you belong there.\" \"Getting out of bronze is easy\" etc etc\n\nI would bet money that those people couldn't carry themselves out of bronze 5 solo. I have seen very good players try and a lot of the time they gave up. It doesn't matter if you get fed because EVERYONE is fed because people just run at each other ala deathmatch. People do not follow pings either and 80% of the time there is an afk or a troll. Climbing the ladder up to high plat is pure luck.","replies":[]}]}
