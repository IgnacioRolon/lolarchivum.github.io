Starting with inting Nasus ADC, then flaming rage quitting Sona Support. I won't do this rarely ever but for times like the Nasus ADC when I see the int coming can I dodge to save my LP? Please say yes because that's bullshit that they basically cost you the game because they aren't in a good mood so they decide to throw from the start. You have spoken about games being held hostage, well HELP!

At the end of the day, it's always best to try and stick through the game and report them at the end if you need to.","replies":[{"poster":"Bushcraft","date":"2017-08-29T20:48:48.744+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"OR, you can dodge and lose a small amount of LP versus playing the whole game out, potentially losing, creating stress that isn't needed, and losing a lot more LP. Are you saying that you wouldn't dodge a ranked games if your ADC locked in nasus? Or your jungler picked Janna? What if you saw someone lock in a support Xin Xao? The last two i mentioned are from personally seeing that happen. \n\nOr would you still rather us play the game, get really mad and start being toxic to the players who are doing this intentionally to troll us? Your answer is probably yes, and then we would get banned for being toxic right? Perhaps figure out the cause of why people get toxic in the first place before telling them \"its best to stick through the game and report if needed.\" There is a reason alot of high ranked players utilize dodging as an actual strategy.","replies":[{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2017-08-30T02:22:57.475+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That guy who locked in Nasus ADC or Xin support was matched with you in the first place. That means that despite his off-putting and strange picks, he has just as good of a rating as you have. Maybe trust him and support him, instead of getting angry and blaming him for everything.\n\n> Or would you still rather us play the game, get really mad and start being toxic to the players who are doing this intentionally to troll us?\n\nThat is a ridiculously tiny portion. It happens maybe one every 50 or 60 games, if even that. 99+% of people don't intentionally troll, and they want to win the game just as much as you do. You may have differing opinions on HOW best to win that game, but they do want to win just like you, in an overwhelming majority of cases. And if you \"get mad and start being toxic\" because someone doesn't play the exact way you want them to, I'm sorry, but YOU'RE the Troll, not them. They're still playing to win and trying their best, while YOU are the one hurling insults in chat.\n\n____\n\nAll that being said, you're right that it's better to dodge and lose 3 LP than to play and lose 18-20 LP. It's just that an off-meta pick is far from a guaranteed loss. What I would suggest to dodge, though, is people tilted and insulting others before the game even starts. THAT is highly correlated with losses, not playing off-meta.","replies":[{"poster":"CheshireGame","date":"2017-08-30T21:27:20.742+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alright, but just to say I probably should have dodged since he stated he was going to int {{sticker:zombie-nunu-bummed}}","replies":[{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2017-08-30T21:43:31.441+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Important notes:\n\n1. It's only the first time every 24 hours (I think) that you lose 3 LP. If you dodge many games in quick succession, you can lose a LOT of LP.\n2. Never ever do that in a Promo Series. Dodging during a Promo Series is a triple punishment: you have to wait 6 minutes before queuing up again, just like with any normal dodge, but it also counts for a full loss (not just 3LP), and it also prevents you from getting free wins for your next series attempt.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"CheshireGame","date":"2017-08-29T20:54:13.218+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for telling me that I lose some LP at least for dodging. rip my promos{{item:3070}} {{champion:4}}","replies":[]}]}]}
