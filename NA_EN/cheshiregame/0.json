Nobody I have asked says that they have gotten any more than one honour capsule, is it just supposed to rarely be attained or is it a bug? Also, honour is just as good as honor!","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-23T02:52:45.458+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honor capsules aren't necessarily a guaranteed drop for being any certain Honor rank. They're random drops you can get every once and awhile instead of the usual key fragment, but also keep in mind that they can count towards your total amount of attainable fragments so if you've already reached the 12 fragment limit you won't see any drops until they reset.","replies":[{"poster":"CheshireGame","date":"2017-08-23T02:57:30.005+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you, but random is a really dumb thing. I was the first person of my friends to reach honour 3 and 4 but I only get one capsule and one of my friends has gotten 3. May I recommend not using a random system, because it feels not rewarding at all when you barely get anything despite being honourable, then another person that is still a level below you has gotten more just because random luck. Just my opinion though, so I can't complain too much","replies":[{"poster":"NiT Arkas","date":"2017-08-23T11:20:12.293+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're speaking two different truth's it seems..\nIn your original post you clearly state no one of your friends has gotten more than 1 capsule, yet in the comment above you state one has gotten 3?\n\nWhich is it?","replies":[{"poster":"CheshireGame","date":"2017-08-23T14:53:34.906+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I forgot to mention, that after the original post I talked while playing, and he said he had gotten three.
