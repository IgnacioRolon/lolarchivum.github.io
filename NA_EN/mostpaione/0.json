Why do you people like this game so much? \r\n\r\n80% of the time im actually miserable. legit misery. I want to play, and have fun. but.... yeah\r\nWhat is so fun about queueing up into a coin toss, the coin toss being if your teammies are gonna be cool respectful people who try to win, or if they are 12 btw and spam racist shit and throw games intentionally. \r\n\r\nNever in my life have I felt such a bad feeling while playing a video game, that bad feeling when you play a good game and you tried your hardest for 40 minutes but lose anyways because the 4 other potatos on your team decided the outcome for you. \r\n\r\nMoral of the story, I shouldnt have opened my client this morning. I&#039;m legitimately worse off for it.\r\n\r\nKMS","replies":[{"poster":"AeroWaffle","date":"2018-02-05T03:34:40.331+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"A combination of it being competitive, high replay value, high variation and customization, high skill ceiling, and a fair amount of content updates. League was also one of the first games of the genre on the scene to officially exist (and not a mod). This allowed them to build a large player-base and if WoW proves anything, a popular game is often chosen over a less popular one because people like to play with friends.\n\nIt's also a pretty good spectator game. Even if you don't understand all the abilities and champions, it's easy to understand the basic rules of the game to watch. In addition to the simple rules, the clear graphics make it easy to see what is happening on the screen.\n\nIf you don't like the game it's likely not the game for you. But just because you don't like it doesn't mean that it shouldn't be one of the most popular games.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sarutobi","date":"2018-02-05T03:31:46.582+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If only there was a way for people to queue up together!","replies":[{"poster":"Dolyna","date":"2018-02-05T03:33:01.939+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Sarutobi,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=Esv7uTqO,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2018-02-05T03:31:46.582+0000)\n>\n> If only there was a way for people to queue up together!\n\nThat's a good point.

How is a different MOBA going to fix that problem? Bad players will be bad. Toxic players will be toxic. It's the nature of competitive play.","replies":[]},{"poster":"aLwGJessica","date":"2018-02-05T08:05:48.356+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its just the fact that you have 4 random teammates against 5 random opponents.  Sure eventually, good players rise up but takes so long because of how innacurate the MMR/ELO system is right now.  The amount of true gold/plat mmr players playing in silver/gold mmr right now, and the number of diamond players in gold/plat mmr is hilarious.  Everyone getting banned plus soft resets and restarting in silver/gold mmr over and over.
