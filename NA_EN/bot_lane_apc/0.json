My monitor is able to pull 75Hz max so when I switch to Fullscreen it switches from 60>75 :/ I can't play in Borderless or Window Mode anymore as my i5 pc broke and I was forced to go back to my dual core pc for a few months and, just noticed that I have a lot more FPS and better performance in Fullscreen mode :/\n\nWish they would fix it already. . .","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-13T05:00:10.109+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is part of a known issue listed on the [**Service Status Page**](http://status.leagueoflegends.com/#na) that causes issues under fullscreen mode.
