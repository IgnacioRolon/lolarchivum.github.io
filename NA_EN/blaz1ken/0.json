Riot servers and Portuguese providers have a lot of problems, we can't login sometimes, we get DC from games with no compensation, we have 3 diferent providers, every single one of them with problems, I'm atm using the internet from Vodafone, I asked in a portuguese group if people with the same provider have issues and they tell me yes,they also have lag spikes, once again there is a problem between riot servers and my provider, I've contacted them and they told me the internet was fine so it has to be from your side, please help me I can't play for the past 2 days","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-15T18:51:53.662+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like when you reached out to your ISP's tech support, they weren't able to gather enough context to investigate and resolve the issue. In order to give them the context they need, you'll want to run a traceroute log, which is an in-depth analysis of your route and each \"hop\" your connection takes along the way to the server. I recommend running the traceroute using the [WinMTR application](http://winmtr.net/). After opening the app, plug in the IP 185.40.65.1 and start the trace. After it's run for about 5 minutes, export the results as text and paste the results here.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[{"poster":"Blaz1ken","date":"2016-08-16T12:33:29.348+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can also send you my LoL logs I've gathered using your tool, but I dont know how to upload files here.
