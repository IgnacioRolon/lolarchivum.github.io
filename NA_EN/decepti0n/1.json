I was in a game yesterday and my internet fked up and I had to wait for people to come over to my house to fix it. When I got on today, it said i have leaverbuster and i know why, so I'm like ok i'll watch some youtube. Now here is when the problem comes in. I did check my league like every 5 minutes. When the 20 minutes was almost up, i closed my youtube browser and waited for the timer to go off. Then...I joined the queue but I never joined a game. I waited like 3 minutes and i'm like hmmmmmmmmm. I went to make myself some cupnoodles, came back i still not in a game yet. If a game did pop up, I wouldve been kicked out for being afk. I the  restarted my client and repeated my actions. It's been like 4 times already and I still cant play. How can I fix this","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-03T01:38:16.275+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like your computer has a poor connection to our servers, specifically the PvP.net servers, which syncs your actions and helps find matches.
