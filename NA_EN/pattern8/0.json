After I restarted the client it said I had a 14 day suspension, after that about 30 minutes later, I tried to relog into my account and it said that I had been perma banned.\n\nJust wondering if I could be at least unbanned, I would still take the suspension, but I read somewhere that riot would give you a warning. I got the 14 day ban but still got perma banned 30 mins later\n\n\nEdit: this was my first suspension\nEdit 2: this was my first warning/suspension/chat restriction/penalty/  I ever got\n\nThe unban: I talked to riot support and they said that if you do not get 14 day ban while in a game, and be toxic in that game, it can turn into a perma ban if somone reports you (or something like that)\n","replies":[{"poster":"AeroWaffle","date":"2019-08-04T23:34:24.191+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Likely something that has to be brought up with support. \n\nThere are rare instances of situations that will escalate your punishment past the normal 14-day suspension escalation straight to a perma-ban. Such situations often involve a manual review and are done when the bad behavior is so reprehensible (and sometimes illegal such as criminal threat) that you shouldn't need any warning at all to know that you shouldn't do that.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-08-04T23:36:20.885+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Usually, one transgression by itself wouldn't be enough to bring a clean account to an instant permaban, but the IFS works on an escalating punishment system. Breaking a minor rule, like engaging the team in useless arguments, has a minor punishment: a chat restriction. Breaking that same rule over and over again, however, doesn't prompt an endless series of chat restrictions. The severity of the punishment ramps up over time, because the goal is to eliminate the punished player's willingness to break the game's rules. If two chat restrictions don't stop the useless arguments, the system will increase the punishment to a 14-day suspension and deliver a very clear message that the continued rule-breaking is becoming a serious issue and any further instances will result in a permaban. Again, the point is to put a stop to this misbehavior. If a player is more interested in repeatedly breaking the rules than in maintaining access to their account, they'll lose access to their account.\n\nOf course, it's possible to break major rules, like cheating, threatening people, or using chat for hate speech, and skip punishment tiers so that a clean account ends up with a 14-day suspension or even a permaban.\n\nFrom [Riot's support knowledgebase](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207489286-Instant-Feedback-System-FAQ-):\n\n> **PUNISHMENTS GENERALLY FOLLOW A BASIC ESCALATION PATH:**\n> \n> * First Offense: 10 Game Chat Restriction\n> * Second Offense: 25 Game Chat Restriction\n> * Third Offense: Two Week Suspension\n> * Fourth Offense: Permanent Suspension\n> \n> However, it is possible to skip to a Two Week or Permanent suspension based on the severity of the behavior in the game. Excessive negative behavior can result in a Two-Week or Permanent suspension at any time without having a chat restriction on the account.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Myrmiron","date":"2019-08-05T22:44:18.010+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Chatlogs?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kaioko","date":"2019-08-05T22:42:53.703+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This doesn't sound like a case of verbal abuse.
