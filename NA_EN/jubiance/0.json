Don&#039;t get me wrong I love her design but she couldn&#039;t have been pushed back or delayed for a support?

They've only been doing 5 champs a year, so they can't all be getting multiple champs a year.\n\nAlso, maybe don't inflate the time? In a month, it'll have been 1.5 years, not two years. If a champ is released on December 31st, you can't just say \"in a day, that's one year.\" I mean, your concern is valid. But exaggeration gains people's attention, not their respect.\n\nI love support variety, and I think that the supports Riot has put out have generally been high quality and very different from each other. I'd rather Riot continues releasing at a comfortable cadence and getting Braum, Bard, and Tahm Kench, rather than pushing them hard and potentially ending up with someone less distinct like Taliyah or Kled.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"WORDSLING3R","date":"2016-11-19T00:26:34.786+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The new items are pretty sweet, but I don't feel that I've been done a favor as a support main. The assassin changes, especially stealth/camo, combined with the ward changes have resulted in me getting ganked and instantly deleted by junglers who were standing on top of a sightstone that can no longer see them. Obviously it's on me to adapt to that, but the fact that my primary gold item no longer does its chief job of protecting me from an invading jungler has me feeling that the new items just balance things out. \n\nOthers are free to disagree of course, but I personally strongly disagree with the idea that I benefited more from preseason than any other role.","replies":[{"poster":"HazyCloud7","date":"2016-11-19T00:51:00.323+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The assassin changes are mostly a nerf, with a few exceptions.

The assassin reworks basically were just new champs put in with the name of old champs. They feel different then before.\n\nSupports although we got some gold changes and some items are still not in a good position at this time. We have no good way to level up, we don't get to do much as far as flashy plays, we are still viewed as nothing but ward bots, and some of the supports really need to be relooked at power wise. We didn't get much as far as mastery changes this season ( unless you are a tank sup ) and even then we are now more vulnerable then ever with getting blown up quick this season thanks to the ADCs, Assassins, and item changes.\n\nWe also have to play the least favorite role in league, if you want to make the role more desirable, it's time to give us a few new supports or some kits that are really fun to play. Give us more reward for doing the work that no one else wants to que for. There's a reason that supports have the shortest que times to get into games. It's because there is a major lack of people queing for that role vs another role. I think there has been only a handful of times I myself didn't get support in ranked or normals when I qued for it as main or secondary. I'm pretty much always guaranteed the slot and I tell you, it can start getting boring after a while. It's a very thankless job, and if something goes wrong, it's considered either our fault or the jungler gets blamed. Doesn't matter if the top was busy trying to go steal their red and got caught out while our team was doing something else like taking towers together. Top will still yell we should have went to ward their red for him or something.","replies":[{"poster":"My Waifu Vanilla","date":"2016-11-18T16:17:19.634+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean supports can actually carry a semi-competent ADC in preseason now with just money due to how much free stuff you give them for buying items (locket, KV, Mikael, Censer, Grail, Redemption, etc.).
