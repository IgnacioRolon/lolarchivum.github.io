Maybe they wanted to dodge the troll yasuo support, but my point is I don't think it's fair to have a remake so early - that means all you have to do is wait in the fountain until 1:31 to have the open option of remaking in the first 3 minutes.","replies":[{"poster":"Hornypotsmoker","date":"2016-07-19T17:58:00.630+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I guess the real question would be if the Yasuo was truly disconnected for the first 1:30 or if he just stayed in base \"afk\"","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-19T15:48:58.897+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"A remake won't trigger if someone decides to leave after First Blood.
