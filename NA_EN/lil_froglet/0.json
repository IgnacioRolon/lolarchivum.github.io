He said he reset his Internet Explorer options to \"default\" and it fixed it. Some of the facets of league use some IE tech so that doesn't surprise me.

I have another account and on that account, while using the same client and on the same PC, I don't have this issue.  On my smurf I can play just fine without the black screen appearing when I click into and buy items  from the in game store. I've tested it multiple times and its only an issue on my main account for some reason. I have also tired repairing at the log in screen and completely uninstalled and reinstalled to no avail.","replies":[]}]}]}
