BROKEN unfair.. He has like 6 hp bars compared to cait's 1500 hp. \n\nAny mundo can just build warmogs, spirt visage, thornmail and whatever other health regain items and he doesn't die.\n\nMundos hp regain need a cap, rioto should decide on what is the maxium health regain champions can obtain... Perhaps only 6,000 maximum... After all tanks still do damage too, its not like they are just giant walls that dont attack back..\n\nAdditionally the maximum hp should be a fixed amount for all champions... I think its up to rioto to decide how much HP a champion can possibly have... \n\nA champion shouldn't have like 10,000 HP and regain all of it in like 2-10 seconds... Mundo's regain should only be a certain amount gained every few seconds... That way Mundo cant stand under 2 towers and take damage from 5 people at the same time without dying...","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2020-01-17T08:18:43.915+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=imortalone,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=cci6vzWI,comment-id=,timestamp=2020-01-17T08:04:48.816+0000)\n>\n> Mundo has like never ending HP and never ending mana.\n\nI don't like Mundo either, but...\n\n> never ending mana\n\n{{sticker:sg-lux-2}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Brefab","date":"2020-01-17T19:30:23.623+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dude, thats mundos concept.\nHe is a guy who injected himself with all kind of wierd drugs, wich makes him go on steroids with a few to much HP items.\nAlso Spirit Visage + Warmogs can be build on anyone and gives them like 300 HP regen per 5 seconds outside of combat.\nSo you claim bullshit, besides garen can regenerate 1000 HP per 5 second outside of combat, whqat is that logic?\n\nTanks are tanks, if you take away their HP und HP Regen, what are they?
