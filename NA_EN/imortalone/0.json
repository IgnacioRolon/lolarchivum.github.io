The whole point of the stat is to be a situational buy against stun-heavy lane opponents and comps. We don't need an item that undoes a situational stat, especially on boots. \n\nAll this change would do is make tank's lives even harder. Assassins can't afford to buy tenacity, they need lethality, damage, and sustain. The only people who get it are the slow, beefy champions who need to wade into the middle of the enemy and soak up that CC for their team.","replies":[{"poster":"Mordepool","date":"2019-02-05T19:47:25.886+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Situationally its still bad vs Stun heavy Comps.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Mordepool","date":"2019-02-05T19:46:21.542+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"TMW you realize tenacity is an Out dated stat that is ineffectual in 99% of instances","replies":[]},{"poster":"Omen46","date":"2019-02-05T04:16:20.723+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"*tenacity sweety\n\nA lot of runes that grant tenacity give up damage and tank for those stacking effects, I think it should be more punishing to take those routes rather than just empowering morgana's long ass q.","replies":[{"poster":"imortalone","date":"2019-02-05T04:41:08.497+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well if they are going for cool down regain or an increase in stun duration...
