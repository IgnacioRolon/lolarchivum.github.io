As i load in the game, it didn't switch me to Electrocute. I had Predator. It was buggy the whole game. I couldn't buy a completed item until I could change forms.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-16T23:57:21.952+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Weeeeeeiiiiiird.....so it looks like that is still a known bug from it still being on the status page, and that rune should have been switched with Electrocute like you mentioned. Sorry that happened, but I'm definitely going to try to make sure this gets forwarded to the right people. Please post this over in Report a Bug as well where the Devs will actually see it!","replies":[]}]}
