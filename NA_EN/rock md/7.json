He feels so slow and does negative damage before he gets 4 items. His W and E are so slow and the champ is just utter garbage.\n\nLeblanc also feels slow. Her AOE damage is a worse version of ryze's aoe. She is still viable for sure but in my eyes she is trash tier now.\n\nKha is mostly the same.\n\nRengar I can't tell.\n\nZed's R change was unnecessary. Just give him back the extra ad on his W and call it a day.\n\nDidn't see a single Akali/fizz yet so I don't know.\n\n\nAll in all, most assassins won't even be relevant this upcoming season. These changes are shit. That's just my opinion.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2016-11-10T07:32:40.908+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I only own Katarina and Akali, and they both suck. Kat can't really burst without preparation and anyone with a brain will move away from her daggers. The only reliable and readly avaiable sources of damages are her q (which doesn't do much by itself without the dagger spin), her shunpo (same) and auto attacks. She does ok at busy teamfights when the enemy is too distracted to avoid the daggers and still cleans up well with her ult. But outside of that she's next to useless. Stumbling upon a Katarina by chance doesn't mean much since she can't really burst you down at the spot like she used to even if you're a squishy. There's nothing she can do if you just walk away.\n\nAkali is even worse than Kat though. She does no damage and her lanning phase against most midlaners is even more oppressive. Her cooldowns are too long and in practice her W is useless. You can't even reliably use it to wait out your cooldowns and prep for a second round of burst because the shroud by itself chunks away 40% of her energy bar. So even after the cooldowns reset. you'll still have to wait out some more to get back the energy to spend them. Also the new shimmer makes the shroud completely useless to anyone with any kind of AoE damage since they'll always know exactly where to aim their skillshots at. At least back before the patch you'd force the enemy to spend 75G and an inventory slot to shut your shroud down, now all they have to do is land some kind of AoE spell and that's it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Calabok","date":"2016-11-10T16:46:23.561+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"everything is just fine","replies":[]}]}
