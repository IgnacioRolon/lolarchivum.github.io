(armor pen amplifies damage by a lot more than most people realize).

Meanwhile ap has  {{item:3151}} {{item:3020}} for flat magic pen. So if you don't have a lot of dot or very low cd poke the passive for {{item:3151}} is all but useless so you can't really grab that. so beyond Sorc's there is no real access to flat mpen. So most mages are stuck with just a void staff which has 80 ap, 35% mpen and nothing else don't get me wrong 35% mpen is great but AD has 3 %arpen items {{item:3071}} {{item:3036}} {{item:3033}} which all have decent stats beyond just their %arpen and fantastic passives.\n\nAnd when we look into pseudo defensive items AD has it better there as well.

AD can use crit if they are basic attack based which basically doubles their damage for free. They have life steal and there is even an ad spell vamp item. AP however gets their spell vamp nerfed into the ground because a few fringe cases can openly abuse the stat ({{champion:8}} you ruin everything). AP and AD can both use CDR AP has a little more use for it than ad but in the case of AD VS AP assassins they both use it about the same.

Like, the only time I want a Fizz on my team is because they have a Zed on the opposing team. Same applies to Diana. She's broken but she simply cannot compete except for counterpicking.\n\nAgain, Lissandra, Ahri, and Lux are pointed out in the OP to be the odd few. Don't include them.\n\nJanna? Really? Are you serious? Janna is a support and if you build her AP I'm reporting you.\n\nBrand is weak. His strength is tied into DFT and since the buff to the AP ratio isn't great on him, he's still in an odd, weak state. He's way too easily punished for his CDs and mana costs.\n \nMalzahar is too clunky to abuse his damage and he's pretty predictable.\n\nAnnie is predictable as fuck.\n\nViktor and Syndra are only good in competitive/professional scenarios.\n\nI'll give you TF but a majority of that is his endless utility. Not his damage. Also, one of the highest winrate toplaners right now is Pantheon so TECHNICALLY his niche already has a suitable AD replacement.\n\nKassadin is shit and his ramp up time is way too long. Won against a Kassadin today who could 100-0 me in a single combo but it wasn't enough to save his team since they fell behind in the period in which he had 0 impact because he's Kassadin.","replies":[{"poster":"Dairdrek","date":"2016-02-15T17:10:28.049+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"You would report some one for aging something that you aren't comfortable with, even though you have no knowledge of how good they are at that pick?
