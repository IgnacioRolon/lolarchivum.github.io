We're aware of this issue and could use your help to investigate. Please answer as many of these questions as you can so we can figure out why this is happening. ^-^\n\n- Did you purchase this chroma shortly before you tried to use it?\n- Have you logged out of League since purchasing the chroma?\n- Have you used the chroma in a game at all so far? If so, which queue?\n- Download the Hextech Repair Tool so we can collect your air client logs: https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/player-support/tools/Hextech%20Repair%20Tool.msi\n\nOnce youâ€™ve run the repair tool, a .zip file will be created on your desktop that includes your logs. Once you've got it, shoot it over to me and we can take a closer look and see what's not working on our end.","replies":[]}]}
