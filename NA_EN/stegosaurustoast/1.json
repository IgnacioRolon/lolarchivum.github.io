Along with having the cool down to summon 4 to 5 soldiers attacking at the same time. Do some math on the damage and cry every time you see it.\n\nAlso, when URF comes, try Lissandra with maxing E first. You can almost outrun Hecarim with the bonus of going over walls.

A good Gnar would be able to solo entire teams since he could just keep them stunned and slowed. In mini form he'd never be caught because hop would be on a 2.4 second cooldown, which is almost as long as the animation for double bounce. So Gnar would wrek Urf mode and possibly have been disabled.\n\nReksai would also be a pain do deal with. Tunnels are limited yes but only having to wait 3.6 seconds to use another would give her the power to chase down virtually anyone. she'd have her E up every 2.4 seconds and would be able to max fury quickly with her .2 cdr Q so E would almost always deal true damage. And 500-800 true damage every 2.4 seconds hurts quite a bit.\n\nKalista is just a horrible champ in my opinion so she's wouldn't do anything in urf just like she does nothing in normal play.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"StegosaurusToast","date":"2015-01-01T13:47:10.919+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"also Kalista\n\noh god","replies":[]},{"poster":"StegosaurusToast","date":"2015-01-02T04:48:31.039+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"oh god i just found another\n\nSyndra\n\nall the balls","replies":[]},{"poster":"goldensilver09","date":"2015-01-01T21:36:06.562+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The best URF charecter was Inmortal Swain, lvl 6 and well, you only have 3 abilities :P","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2015-01-01T21:26:56.544+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Azir would be crazy","replies":[]},{"poster":"StegosaurusToast","date":"2015-01-01T21:15:37.233+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"also how is Kathus  OP in urf? i don't really get it, sure he has a global ult but it doesn't really make sense\n\n\nalso Fiddlesticks\n\nTerrifying :(","replies":[]},{"poster":"SecretAgentHulk","date":"2015-01-01T15:32:32.804+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"IMO Gnar would be gimped in URF, as the insane AS buff and boomerang spam would leave him pretty much stuck in Mega Gnar.

Holy crap. I want to play Braum so bad when they finally do bring back URF. Also, as you said, Sona. She'd still be weaker than pre-rework URF Sona though.","replies":[]}]}
