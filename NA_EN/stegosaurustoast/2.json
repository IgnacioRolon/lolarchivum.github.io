Considering he sits at a 50% win rate currently above plat, AND this next patch for the AP itemization rework is a massive buff to him.  He is anything but \"weak\" right now.

Monster mode engaged soon(TM).\n\nChanges relevant to Viegar in the new patch....\n\n1.  Dcap goes up 200 gold in price, but gets a 5% increase on passive to 35%.  Increases AP gained from Raba passive on his Q alone anywhere from 10-20 AP, on top of increase overall on lategame rabadons.\n\n2.  Liandry's buff to 80 AP, giving him even more raw Mpen he can get in his build, as well as tank \"poking/busting\" power.\n\n3.  Luden's changed to have lower AP slightly, but more MS and less cost.   Overall a buff on Veigar.  Same case for Zhonyas.\n\n4.  Seraphs changed to a NLR item, meaning even more reason to build a tear on Viegar, as it will grant more AP upon being finished.\n\n5.  RoA is changed to a 100 AP item at max stacks, plus more Mana too, if you go a tear route.  You will not run out of mana now.\n\nEffectively, Viegar is no longer locked into his old build, and can now have a LOT of options on what he gets.   He can easily get tear for a ton of raw AP later on (New seraphs can hit 140 AP on just itself+base mana pool), or can grab a \"kiting ~~tank~~**ALL**buster\" build of Liandrys Rylias Rabadon Void that still leaves him with the same AP of getting a \"damage\" build.","replies":[{"poster":"Rrett","date":"2015-06-25T07:19:37.670+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"Never said he was week.
