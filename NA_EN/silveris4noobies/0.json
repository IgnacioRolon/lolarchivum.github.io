I hovered my mouse over it and saw it was downloading something with the size of 14163  mb (14gb) do I really need to wait it out to play the game? Because   when I first played LoL I had to only download a 2gb file and the game was all set. Damn times have changed.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-16T00:17:52.226+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"League has come quite a long way since 2012! With the constant addition of new champions as well as changes to the jungle, there's also been quite a lot of new icons and wards. The overall size of League has grown rather substantially over the years! It might be a little bothersome depending on your download speeds, but you'll need to wait for that entire download before you can play.","replies":[]}]}
