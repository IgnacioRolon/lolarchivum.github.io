I play Garen a lot and I just stroll under towers and kill people. Tower diving should be a skill which needs perfecting, its just frustrating when you get dove so early into a game.","replies":[{"poster":"XeroKimo","date":"2018-09-09T19:11:52.664+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":2,"body":"This game has been out for 8 seasons, excluding the beta and alpha stages, I think we had more than enough time perfecting tower dives. Just go look at season 3 and before tower dives compared to now and spot the difference not in the tower damage, but how it's played.
