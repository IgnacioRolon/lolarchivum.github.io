His shield, a defensive ability, expends his Flow when full. Why not have Wind Wall, another defensive ability, expend whatever Flow he currently has?

I love Yasuo, he's one of my favorite champions. This is merely an idea that popped into my head after reading a couple recent threads about his Wind Wall, so I threw it out here onto the boards to start a discussion. I think it would be a fair change and _gives Riot room to buff him_. I agree that he's actually a bit underpowered right now but you all have to understand that there's reasons for that. One of the big factors being his Wind Wall being so useful seeing as it  _stops all projectiles for free._ Yes, it does have a long cooldown, and again, there's a reason for that.","replies":[{"poster":"Nahui","date":"2015-09-10T15:00:55.139+0000","up_votes":86,"down_votes":5,"body":"I think the duration would last as long as the amount of flow he used.

I think 4 would be fair, you have to use  your shield to keep yourself unscathed to a skill that would probably take your shield anyways and hurt/cc you.
