You might not \"win\" the lane, but you can always survive and farm if you stay focused, respect their (fairly short) ability radius zone, counter-build a little, and don't try to go mindlessly ham on them.  Even in a bad matchup, their low mobility and lack of hard cc makes them gankable if they try to shove the lane.  Most of the time in a 1v1 scenario against a juggernaut, his opponent gets to decide when a fight happens.\n\nWith the ranged top-laners and snowbally DPS fighters, it sometimes almost feels like you might as well not even go to lane in a bad matchup or after they begin snowballing.  They can either just poke you away from farm or engage on you repeatedly until you are so far behind that you feel worthless, and most of them are mobile/safe enough that the jungler likely can't do anything to shut them down.","replies":[{"poster":"The Bíg Ticket","date":"2016-02-15T16:11:57.451+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Jax is so weak in lane rofl...what champion do you play that you lose to him?

It used to be that if you got a kill in botlane, you could not go back and fuck your opponent out of the game by immediately getting a BF sword. You had to wait. Now if you get a kill in lane, you get the BF sword and the other botlaner is hopelessly fucked.\n\nTop lane is basically the same way. One kill equals a huge insurmountable edge. It's fucking bullshit. The whole game is bullshit and it's entirely because they ditched a cadence of upgrades that they have had for forever.\n\nAnd as a result the game is shit. Pros all run zero interaction strategies because they know that a single kill will fuck up the entire game. It's fucking garbage.

I then had to leave lane, farm jungle, and suck on scraps for 20 minutes because the lane was so uninhabitable that I could not safely stand within 800 units of Renekton.  While my team suffered under Renekton's snowball, I played as smart as I could and came back heavy-handedly, clocking out as the highest damaging champ in the game with the most kills and actually the least deaths on our team. This was at the cost of our Vayne's ability to do shit, however, and she died a total of 17 times (granted, her positioning was also not good in the most generous phrasing). Renekton, an early-game stomp champ, was still terrorizing into late-game having built nothing but damage/resistance hybrid items (which are veritable cancer right now), and we lost at around 55-ish minutes.\n\nHonestly, the last part isn't actually the important bit here - it's that we weren't posing a threat to the enemy team until 40 minutes into the game. The rest of the time was a desperate defense and struggle under some of the most chaotic sieging I've had to play against.  The only viable strategy was for me as Teemo to camouflage in an area outside our turret, wait for the enemy ADC to get low off of poke, and then assassinate them and run. It was miserable. It was anti-fun. It lasted so fucking long each time that at one point I actually got an alert telling me I was about to be kicked for being AFK (that's not a joke, the siege went on for 5 minutes with the enemy held off by nothing but wave-clear and Renekton having built no armor yet, and the knowledge that yes, I had shroomed all under our tower).\n\nThis meta is quite possibly the worst so far, not because it's more unbalanced than in the past - god knows the early days didn't know what balance was.  No, it's that it's not just unbalanced, but it's also long.  Riot wants to keep that \"comeback potential\" in the game, but it's such an uphill battle to actually achieve that that the effort isn't even worth it to begin with.  But it's still there - if the enemy actually risked diving towers at 25-30 minutes, they would likely lose unless they were so decisively far ahead that you might as well sit in base for all the damage you actually do back to them.  So the enemy has to play it safe and draw out the game, but everyone knows - you watch it and you know there's no way in hell if they have any brain at all.  So what should have been over quickly - because it's been over since long before - is now just drawn out to oblivion.  Every game is a slow death by stagnation.  It's just not fun anymore.  It isn't - it'd be upsetting if every single champ just snowballed and ended games in 15 minutes flat, but at least then you can know, have it over with, and move on quickly.  As it stands, I look at the queue up option and I wonder if this game will actually be an enjoyable and close game - or if it'll just be another, dreary waste of 40 minutes in which we live in denial.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Deus Imperator","date":"2016-02-15T14:42:31.074+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They should seriously add a item for top laners with this kind of effect or similar to counter such bullshit\n\n\"Doran Buckler\"\n\nEfffect (Melee Only):Receive -50% Damage from Enemy Ranged Champion (Top Lane only)\n\nHP+100\n+3 HP Regen every 7 seconds\n+5 Defense\n\nCost:450 gold","replies":[{"poster":"dunkeroni","date":"2016-02-15T15:39:55.955+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=PrimerAmenaza,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=hiZszW4r,comment-id=0012,timestamp=2016-02-15T14:42:31.074+0000)\n>\n>Receive -50% Damage from Enemy Ranged Champion (Top Lane only)\n\nHow the hell would you even enforce it only going top lane without making the item completely useless?
