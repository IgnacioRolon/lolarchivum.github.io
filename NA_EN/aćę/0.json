So every time I get into any games on my computer, like 25% of the time I blue screen. It could be at the start of a league game, 20 minutes in, or even in a counter strike game. Anyone know how to fix this? My blue screen always looks like this: https://gyazo.com/61f391278efeec1164332db698a5eacb. However it says \"Kernal_PVP_Checker\" or \"Patcher\" I can't quiet remember. If someone could please give me some insight on how to fix this that would be great.","replies":[{"poster":"Starrshadow3","date":"2016-06-01T04:37:03.411+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This happened to me several years ago with league. for me it was a corrupted file. whatever you do, DO NOT restore the computer to factory settings.

League of Legends is not intensive enough where it would cause your entire OS to simply crash, which is what the BSOD indicates.  If this only happens with League of Legends, make sure to [complete a fresh re-install](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202539040) to see if this helps resolve the issue.  Otherwise, you may need to take your computer to a computer repair center to see if they can run a diagnostic to figure out why this consistently happens.\n\nI hope this helps!  Let me know if you have any further questions!","replies":[]}]}
