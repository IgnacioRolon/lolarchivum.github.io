So, you **DO NOT** need to own your premades champion to get a chest from their S rank. **YOU** still have to own your champion though.\n\nHeck, they don't even need to own the champ they played. If someone in your premade gets an S rank, you will get a chest as long as you have one available and own your champion.","replies":[{"poster":"locococonut","date":"2017-10-03T04:58:42.345+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"TY SO MUCH","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-03T04:59:45.324+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ayyyy but do I win too?\n\n{{sticker:sg-miss-fortune}}","replies":[{"poster":"Narshlob","date":"2017-10-03T05:01:53.622+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hol up, so you saying that if I dont own Vayne, but my teammate does and gets an S, then I will get a chest too?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-04T20:11:48.056+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You need to own your champion in order to get a chest.\n\n> YOU still have to own your champion though.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Not A Cass Main","date":"2017-10-03T06:47:57.496+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"yuuuuuup as long as the champ you are playing does NOT already have its chest unlocked that season!","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-04T20:11:14.905+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nope, you need to own the champion you're playing to get a chest.","replies":[{"poster":"Not A Cass Main","date":"2017-10-16T19:26:09.381+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I believe you misunderstood.
