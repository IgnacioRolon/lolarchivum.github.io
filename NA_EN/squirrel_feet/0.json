When in the middle of games my screen and sound will freeze and stay frozen until i fully shutdown and turn my laptop back on again. At first I thought it was something with my laptop, but i've had no trouble running any other games. I tried running the game as an administrator as that was the only thing I could really find to help. It seemed to be better for a while, but now it's happening again, and more often. I really don't know whats wrong and this hasn't been an issue before. I ran the hextech repair tool which didn't seem to help much. I haven't tried reinstalling yet but I really want that to be a last resort. Is there any way I can fix this problem? Any info would be appreciated &lt;3","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-02T20:20:56.278+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you're running Windows 10, this could be caused by the Windows Game Bar, which was updated recently to enable a feature called *Game DVR*.

If you just updated to Windows 10, like I did, I think this might be your problem as well, or just give it a try because it helped me.

Either my game will crash at random moments, or it'll crash right on the loading screen. I don't really know what to do and I would really like some help on solving this problem as well. My crashing started earlier yesterday. I tried reinstalling but nothing changed, I don't know if it's the patch or some other problem. Thank you for any feedback if possible.","replies":[]}]}
