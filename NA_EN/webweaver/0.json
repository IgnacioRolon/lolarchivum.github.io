My connection will jump from 42ms to 260ms for the entire game and the package loss is truly stunning. I also have had issues even logging into the game or even getting on the lol boards.  I would try to load up the website and I would get a message saying I can not connect to it. It took me 4 hours to log onto lol this morning. I have my pc wired to my router because I refuse to use wifi for gaming and I have nothing else connected to my router. Has anyone else had any issue like this? For all I know it just might be my internet I just find that hard to believe since it works for everything else.  I just reset my router in hopes that would help but I guess time will tell. Any advice would be helpful.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-10T01:21:27.368+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It does really sound like these issues are stemming from your ISP. If you've already checked and confirmed packet loss, that's one really big sign pointing to the ISP. Packet loss happens before your connection ever hits our servers, and it usually caused by faulty routing or an improperly working node. Run a quick traceroute to our NA server at 104.160.131.1 using something like [WinMTR](http://winmtr.net/winmtr-v0-92-now-available/) and post that data back here so I can see where you should start troubleshooting!","replies":[{"poster":"PrinceOfStorms","date":"2017-11-11T09:22:15.428+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm having a similar issue - I'm getting as much as 45-50% packet loss on the riotdirect servers.
