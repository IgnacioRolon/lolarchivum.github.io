Your ticket has been received!  I looked into this for you and I do see that the transfer was successful.  If you were on EUW before, you probably didn't get a prompt for a new username because it's using an old one you already had before on EUW.  If you recall any previous usernames, give it a go and let me know if that helps.","replies":[{"poster":"zgerevc","date":"2017-06-30T21:42:01.443+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My brother had apparently played on my account on eu west when i had a break from gaming, but he dont remember the username.

Not to worry, though, since you already filled out a recovery form our account team will be able to check things out.  They'll get back to you as soon as they can, good luck!","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
