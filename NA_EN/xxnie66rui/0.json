In spite of the idea of shields being cool, I think it's not as effective as the old heal, considering it's active for a short period of time. Sona's lower defense also gets in the way, since now she has to be as close as possible to her allies/enemies, and still has no escape. Not to mention the reduced damage, that's pretty shitty. And the reduction in the auras[' range], which was ridiculous, making it so that the positive changes end up not compensating. But her hair?? it's great. :)\"\n\n(this post has 5 likes as of my posting this; of these, only 1 person replied to the post)\n\nReplies to that post:\n\n> \"I agree with everything... \\: She's a lot squishier, omg. And I liked the passive damage with the Q, lol\" (3 likes; this was one of the people who liked the comment this is in reply to; OP replied to this with \"yees :(\")\n\n> \"Wow, you said everything and more .-.\"\n\n> \"I didn't even like the hair, lady, lol\"\n\n> \"Truths were spoken, amen\"\n\n2)\n> \"I liked it a lot. However, I hated the changes to Arcade Sona's visuals, since the color palette of her hair changed but the rest of the body's colors are now totally diferent, which gave it a poorly done, rushed feel (while the other skins received a full update). If I'd known they'd do such a poor, half-assed job I'd never have spent 1350 RP on it.\"\n\n(1 like)\n\n3)\n> \"I liked it, just disliked the heal '-'\"\n\n4)\n> \"A bit weird getting used to the buff aura around her\"\n\n5)\n> \"I liked it a lot, she's more fun, she was too passive before, idk...\"\n\n6)\n> \"It's very OP!\"\n\n7)\n> \"I didn't like how her E turned out, because all her other skills kept their range, but E now depends on people being near Sona for it to work\"\n\n8)\n> \"Very good :)\"\n\n9)\n> \"I liked it, in spite of them lowering her damage a lot... but on the other hand... the heal's pretty good...\"\n\n10)\n> \"OP!\"\n\nI know some of these aren't very in-depth, but it's only fair to translate everything people had to say! They could post in the BR forums, but I figured posting where Fearless can see in a language he can understand would probably be more useful than a sea of comments lost to the tides of the (very active and with very few subforums) BR forums.\n\nI'll update this with more feedback if anyone says anything new. I posted the question (what they thought of new Sona) after 1 in the morning, so most of our followers aren't awake right now.\n\nThanks for reading!\n\nLink to Facebook post:\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/5pots/photos/a.346249485513690.1073741828.328042307334408/416831345122170/?type=1","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2014-08-01T05:36:17.936+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the feedback summary Lyrith, translation especially.

I'll be sure to pass that on and ask them again for their feedback once Sona's been around a while longer.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"XXnIE66Rui","date":"2014-07-31T17:43:28.207+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Updates:\n\n1) now has 28 likes and the following new replies:\n\n> \"I disagree that she has no escape. She practically has a Shurelya every 7 seconds! And becomes immortal in late game. The only thing that really bothered me about this rework was the decreased heal and the loss of the persistent auras. And I don't know if it's just me, but it feels like Q's range is bigger now, and you can use her passive with the skill, there was a delay before. She's safer now in her pokes.\"\n\n> \"I managed to play a lot more aggressive with her, felt the improvements were really good, you can put more pressure only with Q+basic attack... But yes, she has to position herself much better now.\"\n\n> \"I don't know, I don't know. Before I could poke better with her. Maybe I'm not used to it yet.\" (1 like)\n\n> \"Calm down guys, it's just the first day.\"\n\nThere are also new replies in general:\n\n11)\n\n> I got used to it :33 Don't think it's that bad\n\n12)\n\n> \"The basic attack buff from Q should work on towers, otherwise I don't have any complaints, E gives a neat boost and as for the heal I don't know if it's worse, but the shield makes up for it\"\n\n13)\n\n> \"Her new mechanic's pretty OP, you just have to get used to it and gg\"\n\n14)\n\n> \"I think she's much better than before, she has to position a bit better, visually speaking I thought the new particles were a bit extravagant, can get in the way of TFs. I liked her new Q mechanic a lot, you can poke much more in lane\"\n\n15)\n\n> \"I played her mid and liked it, but of course, her main role is support, haven't tested it yet T.T\"\n\n16)\n\n> \"I thought it was good, now my Draven kills with 3 hits u_u\"\n\n17)\n\n> \"Gameplay: The new W shield may seem 'useless', but with a bit of studying the new mechanic, it can be even better than the previous effect. The visual effect of the ult is much better and finally shows perfectly where the ult's going to hit (which, before, was only noticeable with Arcade Sona ;-;). The only thing I'd change is the new E's range. It's too small, and it's rarely possible to get the whole team to benefit from it. In spite of that, the buffs to it improved its use a lot. :33\n\n> Visuals: I liked the work on Muse Sona a lot - she was pretty ugly and small before compared to the others :c. Guqin was too pale before, now she's much better. The hair in general finally looks like real hair and not bunched up yarn threads. And, lastly, the coloring on Arcade looks great, it was too faded before, didn't match the theme.\"\n\nSo opinions as a whole seem pretty divided - I mean, there are more positive comments than negative, but the negative comment also has a lot of likes (which we can assume are people in agreement). I'll keep bringing opinions over.","replies":[]}]}
