I was in the middle of a ranked game, when I lost connection, so I got up and restarted my internet connection. I left for 5 minutes or so, got back in the game and won. I was greeted with a message saying I'm in 20 min LPQ.\r\nI think that's INSANE! Because I wait 20 minutes before a game that takes like 30-60+ minutes.\r\n I got furious when on champion pick (4th playerwas picking) dodged, when I had to open doors to my father and another game was in queue and I didn't manage to accept it in time...sooo I HAD TO WAIT 20 MORE MINUTES.{{sticker:darius-angry}} \r\nIn my opinion, I shouldn't wait for 20 more minutes when someone dodges champion pick, just because someone got their champion banned or a champion they didn't want to play against.\r\nMy suggestion would be to keep the LPQ but shorter, I wouldn't mind waiting 5 or even 10 minutes before a game or queue leavers with other leavers and not on ranked\r\n\r\nIn conclusion I'm going to accept my game while I'm writing this for the 20 minutes and I hope this gets some attention from Riot Games.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-05T21:27:52.196+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Leaverbuster won't happen with just one game, so it's really important to resolve whatever is causing it.  If someone in your premade declines, it would remove you from the top of the queue, and declining a match too often can also give you a dodge timer.  The [leaverbuster](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ) system is going to treat everyone equally, so I'd be happy to help troubleshoot if you want to toss more info on what's going on.","replies":[{"poster":"DrHydrix","date":"2017-09-07T14:36:27.251+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd like to know if there are going to be anymore changes to the leaverbuster system.\nThank you if you reply.","replies":[{"poster":"Zerthios","date":"2017-09-27T00:57:21.136+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your opinion doesn't matter, Riot doesn't care about anything unless it makes them more money, the leaverbuster system doesn't do much other than really punish people with poor connections or client problems. Whats ever dumber is even if you play say 50 games after finishing the 5 on leaver buster you get put right back into the max penalty because they want you to either play hundreds of games or make a new account and pay them more money to get stuff back. Just like if you get put back into queue without playing a game for any reason you have to start the leaver buster all over again because Riot can't be bothered to program something in for when someone dodges queue you need to be punished RIGHT RIOT? Riot is just a shitty company. Honestly can't wait for the day LoL finally fails.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
