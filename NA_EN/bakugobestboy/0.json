I know we have a tendency to be.. well... a little passionate about our posts and replies but that only reflects well back on you because of how good of a game this is. People care enough about your simple \"video game\" that they frequently make public asses of themselves (me included) on these forums and it doesn't even phase them. And let me reiterate in case it seems I'm already off track, I'm not asking for a red post in every thread but maybe like 40-50% would be nice? Especially if they would be good places for your input. I know you all are afraid of getting your head bitten off or saying something that people might take as a promise and then having to disappoint them later but come one guys. We *genuinely like you and want to be able to talk to you like we're just normal people who have a similar interest.* \r\n\r\nI know you're all very busy people, I'm writing this post on my lunch break at work right now because that's how much I care. The few precious free moments I have away from the office I'm spending with you because I think you have a huge opportunity to better interact with your fellow players and fans.  You don't have to spend 30 minutes writing a professional reply to someones \"hey do you liek my meme\" thread but if you thought it was funny jump in there and give it an upvote and reply with \"rofl, made my day\" or something. You only seem to pop up in the report a bug section and even that is getting rare.\r\n\r\nTL;DR for Players: Hey guys I think we scared off the Red's and while everyone who's ever been angry on this forum probably had genuine resaon, especially considering how salty this game can make us, try to be nice to them if you see them poke their heads out nowadays. \r\n\r\nTL;DR for Rito Employees: Come out and play gang, it's just the internet. We bark a little too much but we don't bite.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2014-12-26T21:25:37.650+0000","up_votes":22,"down_votes":3,"body":"Hey there! \n\nFirst off, thanks for taking the time (especially during your lunch break) to post about this! \n\nAs I'm sure you've seen, there's been a bit of a slump in posts, and while I can't speak for everyone, I can speak from what's been going on from my end.

Cant change that.\nI've been playing since S2 and been active on the boards since s3.\nThere was a slump of rioter involvement on the old forums when the beta boards were installed and now that the old forums are down, that slump has not picked up.\nI am hoping for more active involvement in the future!\nThanks for posting btw \n\nlately i have missed:\n\nIronstylus\nWizardCrab\nRunnans\nTamat","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tendrian","date":"2014-12-26T22:07:10.731+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":">As someone who works on the skins team, we've been wicked busy this time of year (as I'm sure you've seen between the content going live, as well as new stuff hitting the PBE)!

That, at least for me, meant spending a bit less time on the boards, and a bit more time focusing on the content.\n\nMight be somewhat off topic, but there have been several posts in the last weeks, [including a heavily upvoted one](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/JeRt3sTU-change-challenger-ahri-back-to-dauntless-ahri) and another one that hit the frontpage over at reddit, where people where voicing their displeasure with the Dauntless/Challenger Ahri name change.\n\nThe community feedback I have seen on the topic has pretty much been unanimously negative, with the general consensus being that \"Dauntless\" was just an all around better sounding and more fitting name without the annoying connotations of \"Challenger\". Since we are already talking about the skins team anyway, could we maybe get an update/red post on the topic that tells us if changing the name back is at least considered?","replies":[{"poster":"ZT Xperimentor","date":"2014-12-26T22:40:14.808+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I agree their first ideas are often the most original, I know I'm not the only one disappointed with all the reworks as the seasons have gone on.

Despite being busy most of the communication from Riot is via other outlets be it Reddit, Twitter, etc. and almost none of this is parroted to these boards. Even worse actual Riot communication is borderline non-existent on these boards.\n\nThe issue is made worse when Riot tries to push the issue under the rug and ignore it as seen in these three posts discussing the issue (Xengre, Pendragon, Xengre) http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/site-feedback/6aEObxRa-okay-we-are-reporting-this-bork-hack-and-the-board-mods-say-its-witch-hunting-to-post-proof?comment=00070001","replies":[]},{"poster":"DSRM Mobius","date":"2014-12-27T01:48:17.467+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know this is totally unrelated but, will there be an ultimate skin this year?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Eleshakai","date":"2014-12-26T20:01:04.318+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"As much as I agree with what you're saying OP, you have no control over the people who like to post 'daily reminders' of how bad Riot hates them...","replies":[{"poster":"ZT Xperimentor","date":"2014-12-26T22:46:51.712+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wouldn't say they hate their gamers (at least not as much as microsoft), but they have become more bureaucratic over time, which has been subtlety ruining the game they're trying to make better.
