The feeling that they replaced it with Nexus Blitz leaves a bitter taste in my mouth because, while NB does have a URF battle, it is only a small taste of the game mode and makes me miss it that much more.\r\n\r\nI understand that there is a large decrease in player activity after URF ends, but what I don&#039;t understand is why RIot looks at this as &quot;Oh well then I guess we can&#039;t let them play URF anymore even though it is a widely sought after game mode and a large portion of the player base loves it.&quot; And not as &quot;Oh well then we should just make it a Custom Game mode and then those who want to play it can and those who don&#039;t wont.\r\n\r\nIt is disheartening waiting all year for a game mode you love in a game you love and then it just not showing up. They took away the April Fools URF, then they made it a winter thing and took that away... I just want my game mode... &lt;/3\r\n\r\nAnyway, leave your comments. Do you agree or disagree and why do you feel that way?","replies":[{"poster":"Arcade Lulu","date":"2018-12-11T23:00:02.957+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Poro king\n{{sticker:sg-kiko}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sukishoo","date":"2018-12-11T22:51:46.392+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":">The feeling that they replaced it with Nexus Blitz leaves a bitter taste in my mouth because\n\nThey didn't \"replace it\" with NB because NB is a new mode that is in Alpha testing. It's meant to be an experiment as they are working to make it into a permanent mode. They haven't had any of the various rotating game modes around in quite some time because of that reason.","replies":[]},{"poster":"fire263","date":"2018-12-11T22:47:13.104+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Long turn, I feel like I would prefer nexus blitz as it constantly has different events, you can PICK your champions, and it has more of a meta than just facerolling and hoping your champions good enough to win. Short term, I prefer ARURF because obviously, it's urf, and its fun to just mash buttons and watch everyone die, but it gets stale when you can't really pick your own champions and then you get someone like skarner 3x in a row, which makes you bored of the gamemode real quick.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Oleandervine","date":"2018-12-11T22:29:50.891+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Does a large portion of the playerbase actually seek it out though? I'm usually done with it after like 3 games because it's extremely rage inducing and it gets super old super fast. \n\nThe same things is true about Nexus Blitz too, it's equally rage inducing because all of the game modes can be stupidly outbalanced.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-12-12T00:26:55.397+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"URF takes too much maintenance, is my understanding.
