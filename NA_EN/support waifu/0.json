At first I thought I couldn't use it because snowdown is over, but then I thought \"Why would Riot not let me use a skin I own just because snowdown ended that doesn't sound right\". Just yesterday I saw someone else in aram use the skin so now I know I'm not crazy.\r\nDo I send a support request or something? Not sure what to do.\r\n[Pic of Gifting History](http://i.imgur.com/Rt4SCLL.jpg)\r\n[In Team Builder, cannot select skin](http://i.imgur.com/6XDAUAw.jpg)\r\n[Says \"Unavailable\" instead of \"Owned\"](http://i.imgur.com/rt45d9S.jpg)","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-02-27T18:51:27.157+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Support Waifu! \n\nI noticed that you've mentioned that Poro Rider Sejuani was gifted to you by a friend. \n\nSeveral players have noticed that content they were gifted has been removed from their accounts. If this content was removed, its not usually due to an error regarding the account. Typically, this content is removed due to gifts being sent as a result of fraudulent activity. \n\nThere are two main ways this occurs:\n\n1) If a player participates in Refer-A-Friend fraud to acquire IP or RP, then any champions/skins gifted with this IP or RP are removed.\n\n2) If a player purchases RP and gifts content with it, and subsequently issues a chargeback for the money spent on that RP, we will remove that content.\n\nIf you believe that content you have purchased/received on your account has gone missing and is not due to either of these two scenario's, make sure to [submit a ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new)! We can look into your account and investigate further!","replies":[]}]}
