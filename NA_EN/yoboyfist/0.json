Twice this week I logged on the website to see if I got accepted. Twice in a row it took me to where I am supposed to sign up and I was really happy with it and once I started to sign up it took me off the page and said \" Thanks for your application\" the thing it says when your first apply for the pbe. Can I just get some help with this I really want to help become a tester. Please email me.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-12T20:40:04.855+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The criteria we use to select testers changes quite often. We may send out a batch of invites depending on what we're testing on the PBE at the moment. One thing that stays consistent is that we look for really active players that are a positive influence on the community and would give great feedback. Check out our [PBE FAQ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751904-Public-Beta-Environment-FAQ#top) for complete details.\n\nThere's no way to expedite this process, so I encourage you to continue to be an active player. Good luck with your application! Let me know if you have any other questions.","replies":[{"poster":"YoBoyFist","date":"2016-10-18T02:36:48.930+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you I will do my best.
