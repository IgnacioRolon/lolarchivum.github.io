Boy was I wrong.\n\nSo, he's super fast and not easy to hit with Q, and he gets out of W puddles very fast. The constant damage from his passive tilts the minion wave so they're constantly moving out of your puddles. He actually out-pushes you, so you have to W the wave to keep up, which is hard to do because they're moving, but it also means you can't poke him that well. Meanwhile, he can poke you with Q and W relentlessly. Luckily, the spell vamp gives you the upper hand on sustain, so I never got poked out.\n\nI'm still pretty healthy, but Aurelion Sol is finally down to about 50% hp after I land a binding on him (*finally*). I drop a W, shield myself, and run in to ult him. Should be an easy kill, right? Nope!\n\nTurns out that Morgana's ult range is basically just Aurelion's W range. And with the delay on W ticks and ulti damage/stun, I have to eat a few ticks of that bullshit getting into range and then for the whole delay on my abilities. Then he hits me with a QR to the face and I die. He did over 800 damage at level 6 in less time than my binding lasted.\n\nThe game after that I was a melee mid, and he didn't even bother attacking me. He would just activate W and chase me with his fucking stupid movespeed. Apparently things like cast times, skillshots, and animation lock are all old hat. Now you can just do perpetual damage just by walking; it's real fucking special.","replies":[{"poster":"Blak PhaNt0M","date":"2016-03-26T14:40:14.559+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Now you can just do perpetual damage just by walking; it's real fucking special.<\n\nWell {{champion:27}}  still exist sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo\n\nmaybe just a tad less special XD","replies":[{"poster":"Big Lincoln","date":"2016-03-26T14:49:25.006+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:36}} {{champion:30}} {{champion:33}} \n\n{{item:3068}}","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Very Hard Engage","date":"2016-03-25T20:16:52.816+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"i disagree, his passive/ W are very underwhelming, and his Q and R are too strong. putting too much power into 2 abilities compared to other champions who need to land multiple skill shots to dish out enough damage to kill someone, and his Q can get **very** large, and his R hardly counts as a skill shot basically making him just a stat monger, he gets a lead and its hard to screw up, without it hes practically irrelevant.
