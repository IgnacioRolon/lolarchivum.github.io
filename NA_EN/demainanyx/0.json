Honestly it&#039;s a horrible place to learn with how inconsistent it is (playing against a Diamond one game and a Bronze the next game) but that&#039;s the best we&#039;ve got.  \r\n\r\nThat said, berating players for being bad at the champion or role they are trying to practice doesn&#039;t help them get better.  Unless you want people first time a new champion or role in ranked, then let them do it in a normal.\r\n\r\nIt&#039;s great hearing your support go, &quot;Our top sucks.  Do we even have an jungler?  Mid won&#039;t leave lane.  And our ADC is missing CS.  Just FF and go back to bots, yall suck.&quot;  It&#039;s a normal game, geez, let people learn.

It is filled with some of the most toxic tryharding players I have ever seen. And I don't mean tryhards as in \"I wanna win this game\", no that's normal in any game. I mean tryhards as in \"If you pick Morgana mid I'm trolling\"\n\nAnd, as always, if even a single thing goes wrong in champ select OR in game, you can expect an all out flame war in chat. With PLENTY of all chat messages to voice their complaints with the enemy team. \n\nIt's PBE. A server where there is: Absolutely zero matchmaking, permanent autofill for everyone, imbalance when new things are introduced, and a primary need for bug finding more than anything else.\n\nIf I just sound like a whiner at this point, maybe this will convince people how bad it is. A few days after Pyke was on PBE, several people outright demanded someone who wanted Pyke NOT to play them or they'd troll/afk. Their reasoning? \"He's so shit atm\" or something close to that. \n\n**_They demanded their team NOT play the new champion in PBE because they felt weak to them._**\n\nSo I guess what I'm trying to say is: Chill people. You're not one game away from winning the LCS championship. You're not at risk for losing your house if the game is lost. Most of the time I'm willing to bet that LP isn't even on the line. If they're outright blatantly trolling, just quietly ignore them and report them after the game. No need to cause a scene. Just.
