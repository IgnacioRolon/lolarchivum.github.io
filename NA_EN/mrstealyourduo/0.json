The only place where it breaks down is when a champion has multiple tools to negate the skillshots, or when the tool that they have does not have enough cost in using it in this manner.\n\nFor example: It tends to feel fair when Ezreal uses his Arcane Shift to dodge a skillshot, because the skill has a huge cooldown and uses a lot of mana.\nOn the other hand, it feels very unfair when Kalista uses her hop to avoid a skillshot, since she didn't actually pay anything it.\n\n\nAre you proposing removing skillshots entirely?\nSkillshots are one of the things that really define League of Legends, and differentiate it from other MOBAs.

Analogies should be relevant to the case in hand, because there are plenty of cases where veigars stun hitting a target wouldnt result in their death as well as the fact that if veigar stuns a high priority target, that means they deserved to die because they were way out of position. \"probably not safe\" Ok in that case its \"probably not safe\" to have an adc than can permanently jump away \"Kalista\". OH WAIT THATS WRONG ITS PERFECTLY SAFE. So lets put her passive on a .75 second delay after the end of her jump so thats no longer the case. You see the difference between Veigar and Kalista is that Kalista actually has attempts that try to balance around her mechanic thats \"probably not safe\" even if her mechanic is still broken in competitive play.\n\nVeigar had clear weaknesses(mana management, lack of mobility, long cd's etc.) and clear strengths as well as being almost completely countered by qss/banshees/ryalis/roa and useless against a subset of champions. He could choose to be aggressive rather than being forced into an even more passive lane than he already wanted. Contrary to popular belief, the ability to itemize against enemies is a form of balance and the inability for people to recognize the use those items bring is something that should be taken advantage of. It's the same reason you don't rush damage if your behind against an assassin\n\nI honestly don't have faith in riot balancing low mobility mages anymore. The current reworks (if they can even be called that) for them have completely missed their marks. The Mordekaiser changes make him atrocious as any kind of solo lane at the moment, from what I can tell Cass players are mad at the direction Cass was moved in (although I think she's fine but I don't play Cass), and the Zilean and Veigar changes did about same thing, screwed over people who actually enjoyed playing them. At least Veigar can somewhat deal with his post changes I think considering he's gotten some adjustment to the delay, he still can't be as aggressive as he should be able to be. Zilean can't even stop people from jumping him since he's more than likely going to miss his damage so its a free kill for the enemy regardless (at least if you take him mid) and if you take him support your confined to tossing out random bombs from the backline permanently while hoping your team's competent enough to do something and you aren't too heavy to be carried, heck maybe this is where Veigar is at, he just hopes he isn't too heavy for his team to carry him.\n\nWith as much as I hate Annie, in the fairness of her being a low mobility mage I can only hope she isn't butchered and told its \"compensation\". As well as continue hoping Malzahar and Zyra aren't ruined later on by the same logic thats ruined the others.\n\nPS : I'm mostly salty over Zilean right now and even though I talked more about Veigar that's only because that's where this conversation started, I don't play the guy anymore so I could care less about where he's at.

Things like Annie's insta-stun aren't necessary evils as much as they are the lesser of two evils.\n\nI hope we can agree that mobility creep here is the true problem, and the only way to truly address it is to both kick the habit of just tossing it in kits as an easy way to make them \"feel better\", and apply sweeping balance changes to all mobile champions that take into account the true value of mobility. \n\nIf League remains a game that involves both prevalent mobility creep and the unhealthy countermeasures it demands, I don't think that's a game I'll want to keep playing for much longer.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Inphernal","date":"2015-08-29T22:47:14.258+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RiotRepertoir,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=EGn0uwFU,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-08-29T03:28:41.241+0000)\n>\n> I don't necessarily speak for the whole balance team or anything like that, but to me, Annie's ult feels somewhat like a double-edged sword as far as game health goes. On the one hand, an instant AoE stun is pretty frustrating to play against. On the other, the reliability Annie brings helps keep things like mobility creep in check.\n\nWhy not just have Annie's ult cast like Corki's Phosphorous Bomb, it would tie in with the theme of throwing her stuffed bear and solve the flash R problem. If it cripples her ult, just give it a larger stun radius on cast to make up for the travel time.\n\n(also remove her stuffed teddy bear when Tibbers is walking around already)","replies":[]},{"poster":"TurquoiseYoshi","date":"2015-08-29T15:56:04.842+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Her passive is a mobility counter.

You can't use the existence of one (or several) champions who counters another as justification for the second champion's power.

Veigar could literally block off an entire team (similar to Azir's ult), or risk getting stunned, all on a relatively small cool down.  Once she throws out Timbers, if you aren't caught in the initial cast that's it, a sigh of relief for a good while. Veigar? You had to constantly be on edge in fear of his E. \n\nAnnie's range and AOE of Tibbers is relatively small compared to Event Horizon. To the point that if she doesn't have flash up she almost can't even use it reliably.\n\nThe scary part of Tibbers is the burst it supplies. Given the right build she can half an entire enemy team. Only thing I can think of is reduce the initial damage, and make the rest be dealt in a Dot fashion? That way there's some reaction and the damage can be countered with shields and such.

Increasing CDs doesn't matter, Annie is pretty much only good when she has Flash up and she still wins team fights. \n\nCDR is too free. Increase CDs and champs can still get max CDR along with mana and 160 AP for two item slots, which ends up being totally worth it for the amount of utility that mobility offers. And with most AP items only giving 100 now, double Morello doesn't even set you back that much.\n\nNiches don't matter when a champion is safer. Harder to kill, better at kiting and chasing, and still doing damage.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
