I'm not saying they need to update all of them to become a legendary up to todays standards, but if they don't want to put resources into it then yes they should lower the price. It is not fair for the players to have cosmetics that are not worth the price.","replies":[{"poster":"Tomoe Gozen","date":"2019-02-25T20:34:26.455+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"##Your statement:\n\n>In the past there have been a ton of 520 skins being completely revamped from just recolors to full fledged skins that would be 975 RP according to this Guide to Skin Price Tiers.

And you actually have the balls to ask for the PRICE DECREASE for a skin because you don't think it's worth the original 975 RP, while you're fine with a higher quality skins still costing 520 RP?\n\n What a hypocrite you are.\nYou're right, you're so ignorant that i don't want to discuss this matter with you any further.\nThe whole quote you couldn't understand from my comment was actually referencing this point that you made.

They are worth more than 520. But if they ever do that they better lower the price of all of the 975+ skins that are not worth their current cost.","replies":[{"poster":"Tomoe Gozen","date":"2019-02-25T22:55:01.694+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"The problem is that they didn't and they won't go and retroactively raise the prices of updated skins.

Because then everything can make sense anywhere, leading to people asking Riot to constantly raise the bar and do some extra work for the same price. Riot does do that sometimes but that doesn't mean if they did this once or twice, that it is fair game that every release from that point HAS to have some extras included.","replies":[{"poster":"Saelon","date":"2019-02-26T00:08:36.391+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Tomoe Gozen,realm=EUNE,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=875Z2ner,comment-id=000c0000000000000000,timestamp=2019-02-25T22:55:01.694+0000)\n>\n> The problem is that they didn't and they won't go and retroactively raise the prices of updated skins.

One or the other. And they have increased the price of skins before, it's been a long time but it has been done.\n\n> \n> 975 RP skins never had particles or anything extra.\n\n\nThis is just factually incorrect. There are a ton of 975 skins that have particles. And the literal guide, I keep referring to says 750 is the costume change, and 975 goes beyond a simple costume change.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"XIII Vanitas","date":"2019-02-27T13:06:02.703+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"OR they could add new features that realize the skin fantasy, increase its price accordingly and then \"unlegacy\" it in order to make the whole process profitable.","replies":[]}]}
