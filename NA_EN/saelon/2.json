Heroes of the Storm or HOTS for short, if you all don&#039;t know, HOTS just recently-ish came out with something extremely similar to what Riot is about to roll out. Level cap raised, loot for every level, a merge of currency, etc. \r\n\r\nIt seems like an amazing change, one that I was excited to see come to League. What I didn&#039;t realize is how awful Riot is implementing this change, in the picture I provided they say they weren&#039;t aiming this towards newer players, well this is just not true. It is blatantly obvious that their intent is to put everyone on an even playing field. They don&#039;t want someone who has played since season 2 to have a &#039;boost&#039; and leave someone who started playing last year behind. Their extremely infuriating excuse that &#039;we didn&#039;t want to release a feature where a majority of players will skip ahead&#039; is baffling.\r\n\r\nWhat Riot **actually **means is &quot;We don&#039;t want to give out dozens or even hundreds of loot chests to so many people&quot;\r\n\r\nDo you know what HOTS did? HOTS leveled people up appropriately, I was over level 160 after the HOTS changed rolled out, do you know how many chests I got? Something along the lines of **140**.\r\n\r\nStop lying and choosing to ignore and harm your veteran players because you are too afraid to lose a buck.\r\n\r\nAnd no, I do not even want to discuss the insane Rune -&gt; BE conversion costs here.","replies":[{"poster":"Automated Riven","date":"2017-09-03T00:14:34.381+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"HoTS is like 2 years old.

Because if you want more chests with random rewards instead of a market where you can choose exactly what items to get, I&#x27;m going to have to go ahead and disagree with you. I would much rather a market system where we got to choose our rewards than a bunch of random chests.\n\nidk why you assume I dont want to be able to pick the things I want. In HOTS you can do both, you get random chests from leveling and you get to choose what to buy. The difference is Riot isn't giving people levels they deserve for playing the game so they won't get free loot chests for the levels. While Blizzard did level everyone up appropriately and give people loot boxes.\n\nI'm not talking about replacing a current system like you think I am.\n\nWhat I'm proposing is what I stated. Give people the levels they deserve at the beginning.","replies":[{"poster":"ChargeItDownMid","date":"2017-09-02T21:38:16.119+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Saelon","date":"2017-09-02T23:35:24.644+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=magewick,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=cEgOZg0l,comment-id=000100000000,timestamp=2017-09-02T21:38:16.119+0000)\n>\n> How about instead of doing both, all of the rewards that you are proposing we get from chests just comes in the form of blue essence so we choose what we get?
