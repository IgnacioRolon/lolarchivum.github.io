GG and they only have 20 ranked games and spend all the time in normals (since ranked is kinda pointless anyways) \n\nLike everyone else is pointing out,  mastery just means they've played the champion a lot,  doesn't mean they're good at the champion (look at all the bronze/silver yas mains you might run into that win by AAing people to death and banking on the opponent not knowing how to fight Yasuo like most silver and bronze don't know,  they got to m7 bit they're not good at the champion), doesn't mean they're good at the game either. \n\nMastery points shouldn't be equated to being good at the game when high rank OTPS  sit at low mastery scores but they're better than most players when they play their main.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Zero Drive","date":"2017-10-11T11:11:44.786+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your technical skill on a champion does not reflect your skill of the game.

Every person has those kinds of games, but yeah.
