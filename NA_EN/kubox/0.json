I think there are three major problems with the Relic Shield line at this point: number one, it's the only support income item that specifically relies on allies playing well in order to work, and it does so by having allies do something they normally wouldn't do, i.e. hold off on CS. This leads to the support getting screwed over when allies farm absent-mindedly, which is especially common in uncoordinated games. Number two, it's an item line whose passive only really makes sense in lane, because after the laning phase the support is usually expected to go out and ward, not join their allies to farm (and if they try that, the waves are usually cleared before they get there). Number three, because the item line's balanced heavily around team coordination, it's affected it to such a degree that it generally feels awkward to use in pubs, while being so good in pro play that even the marksman will sometimes take a Relic Shield as well at the start.\n\nBecause of this, I think it might be better to give the item a buddy mechanic as with Taric's W or Knight's Vow, so that both players get to share gold from their minion kills, to at least some extent. It might even be worth sacrificing some of the item's other bonuses, such as its heal or passive Gp10, and adding conditionals to prevent overlap with Ancient Coin, such as a short leash range that increases with game time, but otherwise it could help smooth over the item's problems, while still encouraging teammates to coordinate.","replies":[{"poster":"Kubox","date":"2018-06-08T17:52:10.362+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Most support item passives don't transition so well in the late-game. Coin users tend to not be that mana hungry, Spellthief's damage isn't that impressive and assuming minions are nearby, Relic heals as much per stack as a fully stacked Remnant of the Watchers. So I don't really care how useful the heal is, but hey, if they want to make all of them relevant, all the power to them.\n\nIt's really more about not being at your team's mercy. Coin users can see a wave coming and simply stop by as an ally clears them to get their spoils. The better Spellthief users typically have ways to easily hit an enemy or two to get money and are the only ones to get money for fights, kills/assists be damned. \n\nRelic users just ... hope their team lets them to their thing. And it's not even a good thing. There's certainly a part of me that feels bad when an ally is letting me get my stacks but I can't clear on my own so they have to come help me and then stay in range as they recall or I can't proc stuff and give them money. It's a very awkward process that no one really likes.\n\nIt really only works in lane, and even then, cannon minions have gotten so important that the enemy can easily make it a death sentence for tanks to go and get it. I feel like normalizing the gold gains from Relic procs would have been a much easier way to balance it out for them, and instead making the healing scale off of the minions. That way the player can focus on how risky he's willing to be to get more healing and not have to constantly think about his bank account.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"IcyPepper","date":"2018-06-08T16:22:09.038+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why not just make your autos \"mark\" a minion after you've completed the quest, like Quinn's passive or something?
