I could use the store, chat, and do anything else you would normally be able to do when updating the game. I ended up leaving it to update while I went to eat, and when I came back I was met with a bugsplat. I closed it, and tried relaunching the client; There was no update to be done, but logging in caused a bugsplat and after two more tries, I submitted one, because what harm could it do to try? I've tried various solutions from doing a complete reinstall to using the Hextech Repair Tool (which doesn't work, either if that helps anything. Just a simple \"unknown error crash for that one). I've tried installing Internet Explorer when it was suggested, but other places I saw it was suggested to uninstall; of course neither worked. \r\n\r\nNot sure what would be needed to solve this problem other than I'm using Zorin OS(Ubuntu based), I installed with the latest .exe using wine, not POL. \r\n\r\nNot sure how much help I'll get as I'm using a not-officially-supported OS, but it's worth a shot I guess","replies":[{"poster":"FunnyChocoBunny","date":"2017-10-23T21:41:03.333+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It think it might help you.\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/XKc4AiKW-install-league-of-legends-on-linux-using-playonlinux","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-15T22:24:26.804+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not officially supported like you mentioned, but it looks like some folks over on our EU Boards have been able to figure some things out!\n\nhttps://boards.euw.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/alpha-client-discussion-en/KKvJh1g7-how-to-run-lol-on-linux","replies":[]}]}
