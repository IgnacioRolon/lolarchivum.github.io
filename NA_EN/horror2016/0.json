Since you can only earn a single chest on each champion per season, you may need to play different champions and earn S-ranks on them to get more chests. Check out our [Hextech Crafting guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207884233-Hextech-Crafting-Guide) for more information.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]}]}
