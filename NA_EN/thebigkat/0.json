They were slow to close out games because they were trying to do so SAFELY, and without any sort of siege champions. Lucian, Zed, Lulu, Lee Sin, and Annie is not a siege heavy comp whatsoever, given that two of these champions are melee and Annie is the only one with a long enough range to break turrets from a safe distance. If you notice, TSM wasn't faltering while closing out their games, they always had a clear objective in mind. They would usually get a few kills, then head straight towards the baron or dragon area, secure the vision, then take the objective. Their two wins were both relatively controllled, only being slow due to the comps they chose.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"PoisonedTea","date":"2015-03-14T22:21:24.848+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Circuit Bear,realm=NA,application-id=9hBQwnEU,discussion-id=jqhX85zl,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2015-03-14T21:09:28.353+0000)\n>\n> I am sure I am going to get downvoted hard for this.

The reason TSM used these comps is to counter what the Flash Wolves were using(Fight Fire with Fire the TSM way). Which if nothing else shows A high amount of versatility in TSM already.\n\nAlso that TSM dominated the wins vs the Flash Wolves much more then the wolves did vs them.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Xavomega","date":"2015-03-14T21:10:09.976+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":3,"body":"In before EU fanboys say TSM is not NA.
