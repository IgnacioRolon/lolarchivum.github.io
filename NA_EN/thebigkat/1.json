WE thrived on early game leads, and is really damn good at snowballing. GE tends to give up a lot of early game leads. They just faced a team that was too good at snowballing. TSM on the other hand is really good at stopping snowballing with cross map counter-play. WE is weak at playing from even since their entire team comp is focused on snowballing. Basically WE is a brawler team that walked right into a TSM counter punch. GE is an infighter that takes some hits to get that winning K.O. combo. WE just hits too damn hard and GE can't get their balance.","replies":[{"poster":"n810m","date":"2015-03-16T21:05:50.401+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Give this man a spot on the analyst desk.

TSM/NA is really just between the entire spectrum. They are just mediocre compare to the rest of the world. I hate to say this, i love Dyrus, but if this keeps up, they are at risk of doing poorly at worlds. Dyrus needs to do better than he is now. I am not saying hes doing bad, but he needs to step up his game and be more aggressive with his team. Hes pretty much campped every match and tower farm and ganked every other couple of mins. This will work for CLG as an easy bait and have them constantly focus dyrus, but NOT china and korean teams. They rotate so fast and smooth, theres no way to grab objectives or do something.
