Accept that this is one of those 40-60% and move on with your life.  Accept that you will NEVER have 100% win rate (no one can) and this is an eventuality loss and you'll be happier with your life.  Whenever I get one of these games, I just shrug and add it to my 50-50% win/loss and move on to next game.  Not that big a deal.  Practice cs, practice fighting, put on music and wait for the end.  I never tilt from one of these because I don't expect to have average higher than 50-50% win/loss.","replies":[{"poster":"PaniczBoski","date":"2018-11-11T19:17:13.805+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"But they won't surrender at 15 min, idc if it's a lose, I care that they take my time for 40min and won't surr","replies":[{"poster":"Jo0o","date":"2018-11-11T20:36:06.082+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"If the game lasts 40 minutes, carries reach full build and kill differences mean very little.
