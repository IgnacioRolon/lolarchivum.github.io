Or anything. Hell I'd take generic emotes instead.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-22T01:09:39.627+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you own all the champions already it could kind of feel like BE might not be as useless overall, I feel you there. It's still kind of working the way it's meant to since BE's main function is the unlock new champions. \n\nIt's not quite *entirely* useless though! It looks like you've got some mastery tokens there, and you can still use those and BE to upgrade your mastery levels too. \n\n> - Earn Mastery 6 tokens for S-, S, and S+ games with champions that are Mastery Level 5. Combine two Mastery 6 tokens with that champion's Hextech shard, permanent, or 500 champion essence to unlock Mastery Level 6.\n> - Earn Mastery 7 tokens for S and S+ games with champions that are Mastery Level 6. Combine three Mastery 7 tokens with that champion's Hextech shard, permanent, or 600 champion essence to unlock Mastery Level 7.\n\n\nEven still, I can see where you'd like some more options to do something with all that currency since you own everything it's meant to be used for already. It'd be best to leave that kind of feedback over in [**Client Discussion**](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/alpha-client-discussion) to get more visibility and discussion going on the topic.","replies":[]}]}
