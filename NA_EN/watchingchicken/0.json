This paragraph just gives some details in case they are needed.\r\n\r\nSo I&#039;d like to start this discussion by saying that im semi-new to LoL, been playing off and on for about a year now and I would like to know why In any circumstance I got placed in bronze IV with winning 6 out of 10 placement matches. (I play support for most of these games so most of the times I had more deaths then kills but a high amount of asists. In most not all) I had 6/2 win loss ratio then lost my last 2 games and expected to be at least bronze II. Last season i won like 2 or 3 of my placements and was put in bronze 3. After that I lost some ranked games and I gave up and stopped playing rank all-together. (Note: in case it matters which im sure it might i decayed from inactivity of playing ranked to b IV by the end of season 4) \r\n\r\nSo I decided to give ranked another go after waiting so long into this season, do pretty well, (I think)  and get put into bronze IV when I was placed in a higher division when I was a lot worse than I am today. So how does this bogus ranking system even work? Why was I placed at the very bottom of the food chain? And how does riot expect people to keep playing when they do people dirty like this? Now I have to climb up 1 slow step at a time to make it to maybe bronze 3 when the season ends to probably be placed back in bronze IV again next season? Can someone please answer my questions? Sorry for the rant,\r\n       Mr.Chicken","replies":[{"poster":"MonstaMunch","date":"2015-05-26T08:17:53.168+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm new, been playing about 6 weeks, tried ranked because I didn't realize you're supposed to wait until you're super awesome, lost all but one of my games, fed (unintentionally) in all of them, went afk during one due to constant abuse, and got put in Bronze 3 (I was expecting Bronze 5). The system seems weird for sure.","replies":[]},{"poster":"FedAsFuk","date":"2015-05-26T08:06:05.402+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The known key factors are as follows, 1) Last seasons ranking, for example this is a smurf for me, I won more games on this accounts placement than 2 others combined, they were placed high silver this was high bronze (b2 i think). The other known factor is MMR of the lobby, if you go 6/4 against kids with b5-b3 MMR the system will put you around that MMR, because you won 60% of your games there and if you belong higher you will climb. Now if you go 4/6 against gold MMR you would be placed mid silver, or close to it. There may be other factors, these are the only 2 I am aware of","replies":[]},{"poster":"hh the thinker","date":"2015-05-26T06:42:34.882+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it takes into account your mmr from last season. it doesn't take into account your KDA as far as I know. also, most people went down in rank, few went up.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CreationFlaw","date":"2015-05-26T06:41:07.985+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not really dirty. You're matched with the MMR you were at last year to a degree. You aren't going to magically skyrocket to gold II if you win all ten if last year you got placed in bronze IV, you just have to climb as you said. Keeper goin.","replies":[]}]}
