Then you haven't tried to discuss with brazilians. They will just downvote you to oblivion and insult you, or say that what you are saying is just \"cry\" of someone who does not know how to play. It is almost impossible to discuss something with most brazilians because of how they behave.\n\nFor example, try posting a thread on \"Mecânicas de Jogo e Balanceamento\" (BR version of Gameplay & Balance) saying that Riven needs nerfs... Even if you explain the reasons why (she has animation canceling, she can burst you down in a couple of seconds without giving you time to react, she has a shield that scales with AD, etc) you WILL be downvoted to oblivion. Then people will say \"Riven is balanced\" and \"Just stack armor\" or worse... they will start to insult you \"All that you say is cry\" \"Guy, stop with faggotness\" \"You are a junky bronze\"\n\nNot that I am not saying that Riven needs nerfs, this is just an example. You may argue that Riven is balanced which is fine, but you need to explain why.\n\nAnother example: No matter how much you try to explain current problems with the ranked system, people will just assume that you are a bronze/silver player that is \"crying\" because trolls/noobs/feeders are ruining your matches, and that you are saying that this is the reason why you are stuck on that elo, when the actual reason is that you are a noob that doesn't know how to play the game.\n\nAnd this is just because I am trying to discuss about LoL. For example, I've tried to discuss LGBT-related threads, but on everyone of them, I was just downvoted to oblivion and received responses like \"everything is homophobia now\" \"gays are just trying to call attention\"\n\nThe brazilian community is horrible. I am not saying that such problems do not exist on NA, but it is safe to say that they exist on a much lesser extent. It is impossible to discuss balance with brazilians, especially since they do not have direct communication with rioters that actually work on balancing champions, such as CertainlyT and Repertoir (even if you hate CertainlyT, he is still there, working on champions balancing directly).\n\nAlso, there are many other problems. For example, at low elo, you can't have a single battle where people don't say \"gg izi\" (gg easy) at the end of battle, and it is still difficult to have an high-elo match where people don't say this.\nBrazilians like to repeat the same unfunny jokes over and over... The fashion now is to say \"é de plasma ou de soled\" when you kill someone, even if you didn't actually solo-ed the enemy (the joke is that you say that when you were 1x1ing someone, but people now just use this for when you kill someone, and this joke has gone stale)\nBrazilians really like to use fallacies to dismiss you, for example... K/D/A and elo are constantly used to dismiss someone's argument at BR servers, even if you made a point that is correct.\nOn the brazilian forums, people just don't know how to correctly use downvotes. They simply don't understand that downvote is not something to use when you don't like the user that posted, or if you don't like the subject, of if you disagree with what has been posted... Downvoted is to be used when the user in question is not contributing to the discussion. Try to explain that to brazilians, though, you will just be downvoted (ironically).\n\nThe only reason why I still play at the brazilian servers is because my friends play there, people on the Facebook groups play there, so I need to be part of the BR servers to better communicate with them. I would really miss playing with my friends that I like so much, I have formed many friendships on League of Legends and I want to keep them. If weren't for that single reason, I would just move to NA... Even with worse ping and language issues, it is way better to play there.","replies":[{"poster":"MasterVidallis","date":"2015-08-12T17:22:06.536+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Brazil has a population of 200 million people and is an extremely diverse country.
