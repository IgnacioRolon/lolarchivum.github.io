I figured the price point was due to the fact that they spent time in designing the bracelet and the box/art.  Sadly, I didn't do much research on the bracelets besides seeing people complain about it on the Facebook Merch page. \nWhen they arrived, my BF opened the Xayah box and the first thing he sees is [this](https://i.imgur.com/E1u55uw.jpg).\n\"Well... that was disappoint-\" {{sticker:sg-ahri-1}} \nWe wonder if that was maybe the only misprint, like the machine just stopped on that page.\nI looked through the Rakan one and find [this](https://i.imgur.com/lADTFOI.jpg)\nI contacted support after looking through a reddit post where I found others with the same experience.\n[Here's](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/9rjdpr/beware_buyers_of_xayah_rakan_bracelets_they_are/) the reddit thread w/ 900+ upvotes.\nWhen I contacted support, I had a couple goals. Knowing that all the merch has the same misprinted box.\n> 1. Ask if they have any plans on reprinting the box \n2. Ask for a partial refund in either cash, store credit, or RP\n3. Ask if they can take the merch down or even just add photos of the misprints. Because if you check their [merch page](https://na.merch.riotgames.com/en/xayah-and-rakan-bracelet.html) there's no pictures of the quotes or the biography.\n\nAfter going back and forth with support for about three days my answers were clear.\n>  1. No there are currently [no plans](https://i.imgur.com/L3ilPvG.jpg) of reprinting the boxes\n 2. There was [no way](https://i.imgur.com/HkdKqPU.jpg) to get a partial refund only full returns or refunds allowed. Oh and you have to pay for your own shipping to return it back to them.\n 3. They never really answered my question for the third question. My assumption is that it's not really under customer support's jurisdiction if they could do that. Though I ended my ticket by suggesting that customer support should pass the message on.\n\n\nSo what now?{{sticker:sg-lux-2}} \nI'm happy with the bracelets themselves. Granted I thought I was paying $75 for the full package, so I'm a bit disappointed the bracelets came in two cheaply printed boxes probably sourced from somewhere with poor quality control. I guess the \"premium packaging\" is some packaging with some cool typos.\nI'm not going to spend money on returning the item, but I decided to possibly help the next person who decides to buy the bracelets by making this post.\n\n**However, I really want Riot Merch to right their wrongs and either take down their listing, discount the listing, and/or add photos of the defective merchandise. This is unfair to the community and players who believed in the quality of Riot Games Merchandise. **\n\nPlease upvote and share my post and/or the reddit thread.\n\nThanks for reading!\n{{champion:497}} Carinasan {{champion:498}}","replies":[]}
