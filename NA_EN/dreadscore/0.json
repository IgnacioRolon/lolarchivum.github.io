This sounds like a security setting problem, so reinstalling wouldn't really fix this but you were close by running as admin.  I suggest going over every step of the [permissions](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) guide to make sure your patcher has access to launch.  Let me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Legendfista69","date":"2016-11-22T13:32:15.543+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ä° have the same problem","replies":[]}]}
