You're the one who is awesome for making my day >:D\n\nYes I am that Sunny Koda (and I still want to see Eclipse Leona happen). I started doing fan art and concepts for fun in 2011 and ended up getting good enough to have some freelance work offered to me a couple of years ago. I freelanced for a year and a half and then was lucky enough to get an interview in LA and ultimately a full time job at Riot. I have been meaning to update my deviantart with the concepts I've been working on since arriving in the USA in January, but riot and relocating internationally has kept me very very busy. Feel free to PM me on deviantart if you ever want to chat and I'll try to get back to you in a timely fashion.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tesla Effect","date":"2015-07-08T14:03:10.938+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Wait, you made this Eclipse Leona?\nhttp://pre03.deviantart.net/8f37/th/pre/f/2013/164/2/5/eclipse_leona_by_sunnykoda-d60dj2t.jpg\n\nI hope you would somehow leverage something and convince the Rioters there to make a skin such as this one. Also this Diana skin to match that Nitenz made that took inspiration from your work.\nhttp://orig10.deviantart.net/5250/f/2014/073/5/6/diana_eclipse_by_nitenz-d7a5lig.jpg\n\nMe and my friend have been playing {{champion:131}} Diana and {{champion:89}} Leona bot and been calling our lane partnership Eclipse Bot O) , and it was actually a successful lane match up which nobody expects. \nIt would make our dreams come true if you made Eclipse skins for these two champions.\n\nPS: Feel free to add in your Official Riot work (concepts and what not) to your deviantART page and I shall make a wiki page for you since you qualify as a Riot Artist now and I have been systematically searching and categorizing each Riot Artist I can find so as to better introduce people to them and to let people know where these amazing artworks come from.
