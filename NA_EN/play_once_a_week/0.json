Just that my account is suspended. This is a hefty suspension aswell, and I haven't been banned for being toxic or inting or anything recently. aswell as no cheating or chargebacks. No email was sent to me about it. I am very confused. Just wondering if maybe they ban the account if someone tried to hack it like they guessed my password wrong too many times and they thought it was suspicious and banned the account or whats up? please explain why the account was banned. I'm off of work and would love to rank up.","replies":[{"poster":"Dark Morgana","date":"2017-08-26T21:46:57.328+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So I went ahead and took a look at your account and it seems as if the account has been proactively locked due to suspicious activity in the account.
