Can you maybe not ignore our core mechanics and make our mark spawn with the scuttles seeing as they&#039;re pretty much dead by 2:20 now? Would be fantastic, and i&#039;m aware of the response &quot;We have other kindred changes in the works&quot; Cool, but how about making it so we don&#039;t get even more screwed over with our marks more than we normally do like what happened this patch. It&#039;s almost never gonna be viable to wait for the Mark to become a scuttle when they give that much xp with out being jumped on or forced to take it already.","replies":[{"poster":"Tahminatrix ","date":"2018-05-16T21:52:57.017+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":4,"body":"And they give kindred a \"quality of life\" (buff) in order to make up for this.\n\nTBH this just makes kindred players want to gank lanes even more, her ganks are pretty good...even if she doesn't get a kill its free poke for your lane.\n\nUnless that {{champion:67}} decides to go all in right after you leave thinking the damage you did is enough for her to dive and play aggressive.","replies":[{"poster":"Im Kinda Stupid","date":"2018-05-16T22:17:06.308+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Super Cow Swag,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=QVasub1H,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-05-16T21:52:57.017+0000)\n>\n> And they give kindred a &quot;quality of life&quot; (buff) in order to make up for this.\n> \n> TBH this just makes kindred players want to gank lanes even more, her ganks are pretty good...even if she doesn&#x27;t get a kill its free poke for your lane.\n\nThis change has exactly 0 interaction to whether or not Kindred ganks a lane... all it does is give you your mark when your ally steals your mark from a camp you were trying to take because they wanted gold to finish an item or some shit, or prolly wanted to leash your mark and did too much damage.\n\nTl,dr the QoL \"buff\" does nothing but protect against greifing teamamtes and does quite literally nothing for kindreds ganking...","replies":[{"poster":"Tahminatrix ","date":"2018-05-16T22:23:21.585+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"WYM this scuttle change literally does the opposite of what riot wants, now kindred may be forced to gank lanes more rather than contest scuttle...her e takes way too long to ramp up on scuttle to not give a long enough warning and if she uses it on scuttle she can just be turned on by the enemy jungler who will easily duel her anyway...\n\n\nSo yes, this change did affect interaction between kindred and lanes as she wont be going for scuttle very much...she already has good gank potential she is going to use it to the best of her ability and avoid risky scuttles\n\n\nOr are you talking about kindred quality of life buff, I said make up for (This) and said (this) makes kindred players want to gank lanes more\n\n-------------------------->(this = scuttle changes)<-----------------------------","replies":[{"poster":"Im Kinda Stupid","date":"2018-05-16T23:35:57.218+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok first of all, You do realise giving up scuttle is giving up the earlygame right? cause if you choose not to grab scuttle (which btw is tossing your first mark out the window) the enemy jg is just gonna hit lvl 3 and gank a lane while your still lvl 2 and trying to clear another camp to make up for the xp you missed on the scuttle.\n\n2) \"Avoid risky scuttle plays\"?
