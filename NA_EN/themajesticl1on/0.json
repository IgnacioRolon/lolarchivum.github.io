League is an extremely competitive game . So i would love to know if there is any way to get my rewards still because i have tried and i love this game to the fullest and am passionate about playing it . Which is why i want the rewards for trying my absolute best and hardest out here on the rift . Heck , even the border would be sufficient ! I don't play graves at all haha .","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-11-21T17:37:03.016+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The season ended a couple weeks ago, and rewards have rolled out.
