Although I never intentionally missed skill-shots or anything like that, I would often play extremely passive and then at a certain power spike (such as lvl 2, 3, or 6) I would all in the opponent and catch them off guard. I use a similar bait strategy when I'm getting ganked, I often far enough up to make it look like there is a gank opportunity but not too far to where I'm overextended and die, this way the jungler stays in my lane and we have vision of him. Also if they were to leave I would fake an engage on the opponent to try and get their attention again. Baiting, in general, is a very viable strat, although I wouldn't recommend intentionally misusing abilities since you could land them and give you opportunities in the future to all-in your opponent.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sona Ping","date":"2018-06-29T16:39:16.593+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Keidjano,realm=EUW,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=TEaiX2Mi,comment-id=,timestamp=2018-06-29T15:57:39.079+0000)\n>\n> Hi here, I like sometimes during the first 30scd of laning phase to pretend I am bad (missplacement, missed skillshot combo etc) while I am playing my main to have the people put their gard off and then been able to screw them (bait, overextend, gank, camp etc). \n> \n> I love to abuse my advantage when I get ahead on my lane and to do by zoning opponent away from cs, poke and push them out of lane (if I cqn&amp;#039;t kill safely).\n> This is happening mainly for my GP toplane grasp and my Brand supp aery. \n> \n> Does this behavior make me a cancer player or just a smart-ass using the ego of the players to win ?\n\nNeither.  The first one is just simply not worth and the second is just what people do to gain advantage.  I mean if you are actually able to push around people as GP, congrats I suppose, but that does not have anything to do with players' egos.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2018-06-29T16:21:46.301+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just be careful that you don't tilt your own team in the process.
