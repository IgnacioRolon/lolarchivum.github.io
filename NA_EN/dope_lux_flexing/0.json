Of course this is all my personal opinion as I do not visually like it, I'm not a fan of the design itself, nor the layout they have chosen. \n\nLet us take a look at space usage(Keep in mind these aren't 100% accurate as I only quickly sliced the image into rectangular shapes, but for arguments sake it is still relevant).\n\nOverall Pixel Count : 256,000\n\nChampion Selection Area: 37,812 (14.7%)\nPicked Champions Area: 92,976 (36.3%)\nChat Area: 29,197 (11.4%)\n\nOther areas being Rune/Mastery Selection, Bans, Random Champ portrait next to Rune/Mastery Selection. My question is this, why does the Picked Champion Area overshadow the most important visual of Champ select by over 2x. \n\nAgain, this is purely my opinion, and my opinion alone.","replies":[{"poster":"Karlyr","date":"2015-05-22T18:26:19.457+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is pretty what I thought too, BUT (there's a huge one there) 75% of the time i just end up searching the champ that I wanna pick. To me, the more important thing about champion select are the champions currently picked. It helps the summoner focus on the other picks instead of his own. (Thinking about yourself vs thinking for the team basically)\n\nYou could still reduce just a bit the size of the portraits to help this issue though. (Just so you have at least 2 portraits more width wise) You would have more space for the chat.\n\nIMO the current champ select screen has A LOT of wasted space anyway. The ban section is huge for nothing, there is a lot of space in between summoners choices.\n\nHis iteration helps a lot adressing these issues.","replies":[{"poster":"Daen","date":"2015-05-22T18:31:34.209+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":">75% of the time i just end up searching the champ that I wanna pick\n\nI'd be interested to see statistics on who does what.  Personally I just enjoy seeing the champion list, it's nice to be able to scroll through it and pick champions rather than needing to search.  The main thing about this rework that gets me, in this regard, is that there are 20% fewer champions shown on the screen at any given time.  The current live client shows 4 rows of 10, this rework shows 4 rows of 8.  \n\nIn addition, there's just no reason that the portraits themselves are so much larger than the main source of interaction.  You don't interact with portraits or bans, they are just visual.  The only real interaction portions are the section where you choose your champion and the chat box, and they are the smallest/least visually present elements in the entire window.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"supes the lost","date":"2015-05-22T12:54:14.747+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":0,"body":"I love this, it looks like a fighting game roster.","replies":[]},{"poster":"HolowHall of Hal","date":"2015-05-22T14:22:50.560+0000","up_votes":20,"down_votes":1,"body":"'I main hookers'\nWhat a slut","replies":[{"poster":"Zirzon","date":"2015-05-22T21:06:31.274+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{item:3070}} {{champion:412}} {{champion:53}} {{champion:111}} {{item:3070}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sky Shadow","date":"2015-05-22T21:23:07.976+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"I love the design and think this is an **AWESOME** Champion Select screen!\n\nBut under the sleek new look and polish, I can see some flaws and if you don't mind, I'll write some feedback that I believe could greatly improve it.\n______\n1. It needs to have the Summoner Names under the splash arts to see who picked what champion and who is talking.\n\n2. The 'lock in' button is just a picture of the champion so for new players, I can see them being really confused as to where it is. I think it should actually say 'lock in' and be on the right side where it's always been for clarity.\n\n3. The Annie splash art being mirrored really triggers my inner OCD. I really don't like it.\n\n4. The bans should really need labelled. Leaving them unlabelled like that for veteran players is fine, but once again. Someone who doesn't play this regularly or spectates wouldn't know what that is.\n\n5. The Blue and Red side need to be more pronounced. You can barely tell what side you're going to be on and for some color blind people, the background for the sides looks the same.\n\n6. This is just a request mostly, but it would be really cool if we could get a 'select ward skin' button.\n______\nOther than that. This is an extremely well done Champion Select screen. I hope that Riot will implement something that looks like this.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Daen","date":"2015-05-22T16:34:29.644+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"I really love the design, it's quite pretty.\n\nThat being said, I think something like this could only really work if the client could be fullscreen; there is a ton of space being taken up by those champion portraits, and the champion selection box really suffers because of it.  There's also a lot going on with the interface here and it could potentially be a bit distracting,\n\nBasically, from a UI perspective it's beautiful.  From a UX perspective it needs some work, namely with sizing and maybe bringing out the middle rather than making the sides stand out so dramatically.  There is also a significant amount of empty space where the champion selection box curves upward at the bottom, on each side; this makes the box look even smaller than the space affords.\n\nIn this remake there are 8 champions displayed horizontally rather than the 10 displayed in live, with the same four rows.  This is 32 champions displayed at once rather than 40, which is effectively a 20% reduction in usability.\n\nOne other question: If Riot were to increase the number of bans, where would this fit into the UI rework you have designed?  The current implementation has space built into the UI for another two bans on each side (for a total of ten bans) if needed.\n\nEdit: This just occurred to me, where is the Lock In button?","replies":[{"poster":"Kodda","date":"2015-05-22T19:35:15.181+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agreed, i think the LoL client should be full screen, while being able to minimize it like the normal one.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"RussoRed","date":"2015-05-22T11:34:16.701+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"just one question why is annie the only one thats backward","replies":[{"poster":"Akriya","date":"2015-05-22T14:17:01.596+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"actually Orianna is backwards too and I don't think its backwards so much as that's the pose in the art so that's just the way it works out, if you put her on the other team she would be facing the right direction:P","replies":[{"poster":"RussoRed","date":"2015-05-22T14:31:34.768+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Akriya,realm=NA,application-id=LFfTlAky,discussion-id=uwqsFKUY,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2015-05-22T14:17:01.596+0000)\n>\n> actually Orianna is backwards too and I don't think its backwards so much as that's the pose in the art so that's just the way it works out, if you put her on the other team she would be facing the right direction:P\n\nshes not backwards in her splash she has her back twards you looking over her left shoulder its on the right side","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Curling Veigar","date":"2015-05-22T18:22:50.621+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":4,"body":"what retards leave gragas and sejuani unbanned?","replies":[{"poster":"BADxW0LF","date":"2015-05-22T19:40:29.079+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"this is probably an older model from before the tank meta...retard (only saying so because you seem it's appropriate to call people retards when you don't think)","replies":[{"poster":"MacDthree","date":"2015-05-22T19:55:44.033+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"shhh don't use logic. he wont get it.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Digielf","date":"2015-05-22T15:20:34.736+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":19,"body":"Yes the one that we have right now is terribly old Riot are sad virgin nerds who cant even make an interface ","replies":[{"poster":"MacDthree","date":"2015-05-22T19:59:41.590+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"and you're a \"sad virgin nerd\" who can't even use proper grammar or punctuation.
