A pop-up menu should appear.\n\n- At the top of the pop-up menu there should be a drop down list. Reassign from default to keyboard function. \n\n- Underneath the drop down menu there should be a rebind key to section click this and then bind it to a key that is unused in game (for example the J key). \n\n- Launch a game of league and rebind what you want to be bound to the mouse button to the same button as you chose in Razer Synapse (e.g. J).\n\nHopefully this will help someone.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AeQ Maggi","date":"2017-04-19T08:12:56.779+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have the exact same issue. It's for a week now. I'm not sure if a Razer Update messed this up or league itself. When changing the buttons to something else (like MB4 = PageUp & MB5 = PageDown) then it is recognized ingame. But then you also have to change the buttons on every other game - which isn't nice.\n\nSo I'll report this to razer and hope for a fix. I think it's an issue with razer, not lol.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pavalin","date":"2017-08-07T21:19:15.470+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it still dosent work for me either. dunnno what to do i reinstalled razer and leauge but it still dosent woek in game. i can bind them but not use them","replies":[]},{"poster":"psYcho edgE","date":"2017-07-26T08:29:31.474+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Still doesn't work until today. \nI am a little bit pissed because mapping my mouse buttons to keyboard buttons isn't supposed to be a solution, it's a workaround and also makes the buttons unusable in other applications.","replies":[]},{"poster":"poepn","date":"2017-07-01T21:59:59.673+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well This is still an issue.

I friggin love mine, but I digress....\n\nSo those MB 4/5 might not be working due to some weird conflicts with the razr synapse software. Let's try disabling that, and then see if League will let you bind those keys. If it still won't let you, hit up our tech guys in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and let them know you need help binding those keys.","replies":[{"poster":"Veenb","date":"2017-05-30T08:54:36.320+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For me mb 4/5 wont work anymore... it started last patch dunno what to do cause I can't spam my mastery enough now :p","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Zerogamelol","date":"2017-05-17T04:13:07.242+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can confirm, this just started happening to me within the past few days.

Razer says it's a problem with LoL itself because of the fact that the buttons are working for every other program/game. Riot has recorded the issue. \nI still have no idea if this problem is from razer, Riot or Windows. Riot asked me if there were updates I installed the time around the error occured, but I couldn't tell anymore... \n\nI recently reinstalled my system completely and the error is still there. Riot told me they investigate the issue and sit tighten up and wait until a fix. I'm still glad because there is no ping-pong between razer and riot where they blame each other.\n\nSo we have to wait guys.... hopefully they'll fix it soon. I don't know which actions you binded with MB4 &amp; MB5. For me it was Mastery Emote and Enemy Missing Ping. I can live without the mastery emote so I binded enemy missing ping on my middle mouse button which works.\n\nRegards\nAeQ Maggi","replies":[]}]}
