It was just brought to my attention that apparently part of my summoner name is \"inappropriate.\" I've had this name for years as a username, and also as a summoner name. I'm not exactly sure how \"Kiki\" is inappropriate, but can someone please tell me why it is, or remove it from the profanity filter?
