The countdown for Riot's downfall has started and its just a matter of time before LOL is forgotten/changed/ or bought by a new company that would fix Riot's crap.","replies":[{"poster":"Marshbouy","date":"2016-10-03T01:24:07.840+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Remember at the start of the season when league was dying? \nRemember when league was confirmed to have 100 million active players?","replies":[{"poster":"Demonic Freak 66","date":"2016-10-03T01:32:28.340+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"and i wonder if that 100 million \"ACTIVE\" players are really active and how many of them are duplicate accounts? have you never seen players that are smurfs who are leveling their other accounts? not to mention players that get banned and therefore create a new account (yeah because riot is that dumb and they are not really keeping those players away but rather forcing them to create more accounts which could be for the sole reason of showing the world that they have more players than they really do). \n\nAnyways before you argue what i was saying in my previous message, i recommend you read the reviews i posted because those reviews are from many different players who have played LOL for years now. My original account was started in 2010 which means i have witnessed all the changes that riot came up with and how it changed. LOL was started as a game for fun true, but along the way Riot lost sight of that and started focusing on more ways to make more money out of the game.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sniper 0","date":"2016-10-03T01:39:34.215+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"216 comments equal=a large portion of the community...?\nSo in your book, that's enough reviews to damn a game?

The game has the potential of being awesome but the company that drives it and basically has no customer service skills whatsoever are the ones ruining it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Handy Sandy ","date":"2016-10-03T01:29:12.964+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That post has so much things that aren't even close to true..I just...just no","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-10-03T01:30:26.207+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"An ancient review, some salty scrubs?","replies":[{"poster":"Demonic Freak 66","date":"2016-10-03T01:35:05.533+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Feb 2016 and june 2016 are ancient?? lmao atleast you want to make claims try to verify them first so that you do not look like a total idiot","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-10-03T02:39:59.851+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Feb 2016, with a picture from.. 2010??","replies":[{"poster":"Demonic Freak 66","date":"2016-10-03T03:29:07.589+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"honestly, are you retarded or mentally disabled? i need to know because if that is the case then there would be no arguing with you. each review has a date next to it, you can't just look at the picture and be able to know what each individual has posted for their reviews, besides the picture is by the website that created the main article, while the reviews are for individual gamers that commented their own experiences. \n> on September 4, 2016\n> Worst community ever!!\n> Boosted accuonts, scripters. i played 4 years and now try new moba.\n> Never again LOL!\n\n> on April 9, 2016\n> gg was my favourite game until i lost my fcking promos because of some noob trollers who then reported me for offensiv language.

Now you get those companies that would help you bump up your rank for a price, you think Riot is not aware of that and taking advantage of it? i freakin get messages from those companies offering such services and i start wondering how is this game fair when some company is bringing in professionals to play on behalf of the regular players that you and i think we are supposed to be going against. and Riot does not prevent that, it encourages it instead.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
