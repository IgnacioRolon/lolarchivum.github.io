Instead it basically EZ modes snowballing madness into that category and every time a person who does better then the top percentile, it ups the percentiles and results in it getting harder for the next guy.\n\nInstead, players are 'basically urged by this system' to play weird playstyles like blitzcrank mid, support 'sion, nasus, galio, etc. top laners' or hell even Ezreal jungle. Where said positions would end up giving alot more score then they normally would in the standard positions. While as the season gets in later, the chance of hitting a S rank becomes even worst as the season starts to near its end. \n\nWhat riot needs to adjust on this system is have it take into account on common picked champions and make those ones have a harder time getting S rank and ones that rarely get picked to get a higher chance of S ranks. While using a variable like percentile to give more room for rarely used champions to get a S rank and basically punish the constant norm picked players into having to play insanely good to S rank on those champions. \n\nSince clearly they can't say 'give bonus points' for a player, if say a... Taric stopped a 4 man gank from swarming your bot turret and allowed the ADC to net 2 to 3 kills out of it thanks to some well used W shielding, E stunning and R death denial(Yet didnt even get a A rank minimum out of gank denial several times with CC, healing and shields). Because denying the death of a team mate at low health should really be added to a support's score considering most these days rather play damage denial scum like {{champion:117}} {{champion:43}} or just be play making jerks like {{champion:412}} {{champion:53}} {{champion:432}} {{champion:57}} or just plain jerks in general like {{champion:16}} or why the hell is Janna getting 'abusive buffs' like {{champion:40}}.\n\nGame needs plenty of fixings and im also one of those players who still has not gotten a honor level 3 somehow...\n\n{{sticker:sg-soraka}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-04T01:06:22.792+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not the score that was bad at all! It's just that apparently some people are doing better when using the Champion you used in which role you were playing.
