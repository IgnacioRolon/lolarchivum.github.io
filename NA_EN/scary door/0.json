That is not what ranked is for. Chances are someone will dodge or you'll be a massive hindrance to your team. Understanding how to play a certain role is not the same thing as executing it. \n\nI played one champion, one role, for the entire season and went from silver to diamond without playing any other role or any other champion. I have a 65% winrate with that champion. Are you going to tell me I don't understand the game because I've never played other roles? You do not need to play a role to understand it. \n\nYou should never have to play your off-role in ranked, the fact that this is happening is completely fucking retarded and ruins match quality.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Mysticman89","date":"2016-11-26T23:22:11.950+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"I assure you he can play it, even if he's not the best at it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Miror B","date":"2016-11-26T23:30:19.308+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"See, the problem I see with your little \"comparison\" is that only few people in the world can consider themselves equal to or greater than Brady (Peyton Manning potentially one of them, Elway/Marino potentially better than him). In reality, many of the people in this game are a lot like Julian Edelman/Terrelle Pryor/Tim Tebow (the people in bronze 5 being massive tebows): while they can be decent at one particular role choosing an easier one (in the first two's cases, WR) isn't exactly a terrible idea.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jalkan","date":"2016-11-26T23:27:42.399+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That would be like comparing solo queue to premade 5s. You do only need to play one role if you're going as a 5-man premade. In solo queue you have a chance at getting any one of the roles, though it's small due to new draft pick.","replies":[]}]}
