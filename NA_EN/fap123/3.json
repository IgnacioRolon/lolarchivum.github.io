It's purely a visual bug, though, so the ward skin is still on your account, you just can't select it at the moment.\n\nI don't have a timeline I can provide as to when this issue will be resolved, but please let me know if you have any other questions.","replies":[{"poster":"Declined","date":"2016-08-15T23:10:26.837+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was wondering, rather than typing out a reply to everyone who's missing their ward skins and come here to complain, wouldn't it be more helpful to create a thread about it, lock it and stick it on top of Help and Support for the time being, even if it just decreases the amount of threads by 20% then that is still a significant amount.\n\nIf you're worried about a red sticker, I took the liberty of creating a thread, or you could ask some of your NA wrenchies to post it.\n\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/pOslJHiQ-knownward-skins-missing","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lew","date":"2016-08-15T03:44:20.210+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It just a bug right now. http://status.leagueoflegends.com/?en_US#na","replies":[]}]}
