IS there something going on with it or did i just get my 2nd gemstone in advance?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-03T22:08:00.963+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds strange that you wouldn't get a gemstone after waiting the required amount of time, so I took a look into your specific issue.  I discovered that you received a gemstone with both bundle purchases, setting your total to 4.  Nothing looks out of order here!  \n\nIf you would like some additional information such as time or other specifics, our billing team can help you out.

No big deal, I am sure I can use it at some point.  \nWould be helpful to chat about some things to do with the game there now but I guess I will wait.\n\nEDIT: I hadn't checked since earlier, and it is working now.  Problem solved. ","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
