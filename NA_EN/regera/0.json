Everything runs perfectly until after i login. When the client first appears, I receive a message reading \"Unknown Error has occurred.\" After logging out and in multiple times AND restarting my computer several times, the issue was NOT resolved. I uninstalled and reinstalled League. Again. Same issue. Only this time it doesn't have the tiny window pop up but and the bottom of the client there is 2 messages reading \"Reconnect to Chat\" and \"Unable to connect to chat, you may reconnect manually.\" Of course I have clicked the reconnect button but it doesn't work. I run a MacBook air 2013. The computer is new it cannot possibly be the issue. So my question is: Is there a well known solution that I don't know of? And is anyone else having the same issue?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-22T22:20:37.335+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There were some server issues during this period, but everything should be fine now.
