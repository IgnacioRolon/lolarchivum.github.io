It's shitty when you get them in your game, I agree. But Riot has never taken a stance against having multiple accounts.\n\n**_Ideally_** they'll quickly be placed with people of their skill level within a few dozen games (or at least placed with a group that pounds their face in). But matchmaking in a team-based game is bound to be inaccurate quite a lot.","replies":[]}]}
