But its how I received it that pisses me off. I click accept, but I get put back into the queue screen instead of champ select. My friend sitting next to me joins, but I'm left stranded in limbo. For the entirety of champion select I missed out on it and eventually as it ended, I got given a dodge punishment for effectively no reason on my part. About a minute after, my league client popped up and made me \"join\" the champion select, which already ended a while ago, but it played through the music and went super fast before sticking me into an \"asset-less\" champion select screen with no way to exit it besides from clicking the default X button at the top, which still has the queue dodge warning.\n\nWtf???","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-22T18:28:31.543+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like your network is losing sync and leaving you behind.
