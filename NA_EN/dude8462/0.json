Not thinking there was any problem, I got into game. I couldn't even see the loading screen, all my monitor says \"out of range\". I quickly switched back to the old VGA cable to see if that would work, but I still have the same problem. \r\n\r\nNow I am in game and can move, but I can't see anything. Luckily it's an aram game so it's not a big deal, but how do I fix this for future games? \r\n\r\nAny assistance would be appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-27T18:00:46.573+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the detailed info here!  I also appreciate your swapping back cables to double check this.  Something may have gotten messed up with your config settings and failing to render render your game with the correct resolution.  In fact, I'm betting that tapping Alt+Enter while in-game will swap you to Windowed mode and restore your game screen.\n\nMy suggestion for this specific issue would be to try resetting your config to reset your settings back to default.\n\nLog into the game client.\nNavigate to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config\nDelete the file  named **game.cfg** and **persistedsettings.json**\nGo into a custom game and verify that settings have saved properly.  Leave game to sync settings. \n\nLet me know if that works for you, but be sure to test it in a custom game!","replies":[{"poster":"dude8462","date":"2017-05-27T18:23:24.097+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi thanks for the help. I deleted the files as you suggested. I was able to switch the game to windowed mode with alt enter, but after resetting the settings to default I still couldn't do full screen. \n\nI had the in-game resolution to 1600*900, identical to my desktop resolution, and I still couldn't do full screen mode. I can play the game in windowed mode just fine, but I have never done that before and would like to still play in full screen mode. Could you help me fix this problem?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-27T18:40:30.556+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have a follow-up, friend!  A colleague reached out with some steps that could help your specific situation.  Try this out to adjust your settings and read your display:\n\n- Unplug the monitor while you have your computer on and replug it after waiting a few minutes. As an added step if it's possible, try to switch your monitor to another port (from HDMI to DVI or VGA).\n- Once you did this, restart your computer to save all changes.\n- Then after you restarted your computer, you'll have to access the Device Manager (choose Start -> type Device Manager).\n- Once you entered the Device Manager, go to Monitors, choose your monitor (usually is displayed with Generic PnP Monitor), right click and choose Update Driver Software.\n- Follow the steps from the wizard and you're good to go!\n\nWith these changes, you'll have to get a new set of settings for the client. Meaning, you'll need to** reset your config** one more time just like before.\n\nLet us know if this works out for you!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-27T18:25:40.397+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm glad to hear some progress has been made!
