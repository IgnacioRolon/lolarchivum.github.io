If I see Rengar jg on their team and I just picked adc I get a really strong urge to just dodge. Your team legit has to pay close attention to you or your mid, save all of their abilities and hope he doesn't kill you before they kill him (he will). Even if he dies, him taking out the enemy adc ESPECIALLY when his is fed is just gg for a fight.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kapppaccino","date":"2015-09-22T20:57:34.463+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You wait til he jumps then flash away if you live by some miracle only to be sniped by a minion","replies":[]},{"poster":"luckmallory","date":"2015-09-22T20:55:54.718+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{item:3341}} {{item:2043}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Miraweave","date":"2015-09-22T20:52:02.796+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"go afk","replies":[]},{"poster":"Neotrixed","date":"2015-09-22T21:15:17.821+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{item:3157}}","replies":[]}]}
