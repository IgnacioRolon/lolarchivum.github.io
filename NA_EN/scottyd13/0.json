Site says payment authorized but nothing happens 2 days after that, no shipping or anything which was strange because they always ship out quick.  Submitted a ticket for this and was told the authorization didnt fully go through and I would have to create another order.  Fine, no problem, shit happens.  I submit the second order, and a few hours later, both orders are now in canceled status, yet they still decided to charge my paypal 100 bucks.  Reopened the ticket and asked for assistance immediately.  It's been 14 hours and I havent heard a damn thing.  Riot, get your shit together and get a god damn support number to call for the merch store.  You can't just go and steal peoples money, not ship out their stuff, and think it will be ignored.  If I have to end up going through Paypal to get this money back, there will be hell to pay.  Your response time for this ticketing system is a friggin joke.  It should not take as long as it does to answer these issues if your employees actually knew how to do their job.  This is 2 god damn orders you screwed up in less than a week, and I'm sitting here with my dick in my hand trying to get a response from you morons.  How tf does that happen?  Overhaul your support system because it is not working.","replies":[{"poster":"ScottyD13","date":"2017-08-26T01:14:07.866+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"31485818 is the ticket number.....ive now been told to put in a third order....not gonna matter much as my friends bday is tomorrow and now theres no chance in hell she'll get it in time....at this point i should be comp'ed something but i know thats not gonna happen either","replies":[{"poster":"Dark Morgana","date":"2017-08-26T21:23:41.801+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea, it looks like the system ran into a few errors. Which isn't cool either way, but it does look as if the specialist help with the refunding. Sorry about all the frustration and we'll work to improve merch orders in the future.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-08-25T22:13:03.960+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't have visibility on merchandise orders, but it sounds like you've been going through a really shitty experience and I'd like to take a closer look.  Do you have a ticket number I can check out?","replies":[]}]}
