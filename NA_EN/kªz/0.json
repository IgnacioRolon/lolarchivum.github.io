This is actually intended. \n\nAs WizardCrab had [responded](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/3hsyjl/should_jaximus_really_become_a_legacy_skin/cuagp2i) to [this Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/3hsyjl/should_jaximus_really_become_a_legacy_skin/) when we considered putting him in the legacy vault - \n\n**Original Post**\n\n\"*I was talking with some friends when we saw that Jaximus was headed into the legacy vault. This seems like a strange decision to me, as Jaximus is edited (given the quote \"Here's to you, kid\") in order to honor the memory of a guy named Joe from the Make a Wish foundation who passed away some time after visiting Riot HQ. Shouldn't it remain readily available in order to continue to honor his memory? *\n\n**Reply**\n\n*Fair enough. The connection hadn't occurred to me when I put the list together, and I apologize. I'll make sure he doesn't leave the store. \nA thought occurs to me though. *\n\n*What if we still tag him as Legacy, but he never leaves the store? This way, most of the year when there are no other Legacy skins available, he'll be the only skin that shows up under the 'Limited Availability' tag in the store, prompting people to ask their friends why. This way more League players will hear about Joe. *\"\n\nYou can find more about Joe [here](http://forums.euw.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=685165)!","replies":[{"poster":"kªz","date":"2015-12-10T22:57:14.842+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh I didn't realize xD","replies":[]}]}]}
