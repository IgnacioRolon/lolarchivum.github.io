So i installed the update and then logged into my league account. I then tried to get into a game, got into a match after waiting in the queue for a while and then my champion select screen didnt load up. I waited for a bit and then got a message saying i had left champion select; i tried to get into another game and then it said i was blocked from joining a game for 5 minutes because I had left a game during champ select. After 5 minutes my champion select still didnt load up. After that i spent a while just restarting my laptop and such, just trying to get it to work. I then installed Hextech repair tool and tried to re-patch league. After that League just wouldnt load up, so i tried the 'clean uninstall' option and did all that. League then had an error at 99% saying an unspecified error has occured please check the logs for more information, I tried again and found the same error but this time at 6% and then again at 15%. I then manually uninstalled everything on my computer to do with league and then re-installed it and i got the same error, this time at 33%. I cant find a way to actaully launch league at all! Also: im running windows 7 and the errors start occuring after it asks me to upgrade to the open beta, which it gives the same errors for whichever one i pick. Can someone please tell what I have to do to be able to play league again :(.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-22T23:37:39.622+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your issues on champion select sounds to be a conneciton prblem that's causing you to lose sync and get left behind.  Your unspecified error at 99% further affirms that, which is when the patcher is downloading updates but failing to keep up.  I highly recommend going over each step of the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to be sure.\n\nAlso, the [hextech repair tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367) may not work currently on the updated client and may cause more issues.  If the connection guide doesn't work, I recommend performing a [reinstall](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202539040-Reinstalling-League-of-Legends) to resolve any potential corruption during installation.  Hope this helps!","replies":[]}]}
