ALSO, my games keep crashing even when Riot seemed to have fixed the client crashing before the loading screen. Someone help me get this message to riot. I have lost promos, and keep getting suspended when it is not even my FAULT! \n\nHelp me get this message out to riot for my unfair punishment. It is not my fault and I do not deserve these suspensions!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-28T21:36:10.830+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd like to help you out, but I'm a bit confused on this issue and need some more information.  One piece that's confusing me is mentioning that you cannot login to the game, yet your client is crashing when loading a game.  Can you provide some more information on what you're observing and when?  Any error messages you receive would help a lot too.  Thanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Tavite Guzelian","date":"2016-07-28T22:08:55.910+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes. Basically it takes me a few tries to get to the login screen, approximately 6-7 tries. Every time i click the launch, it doesn't work but for me to actually get to the login i must do it a numerous amount of times. The next issue, is when i actually got passed the login. I got into a game and before it started (right after the champ select), it crashed and said there is a data issue. I tried using the repair tool as told by riot but it did nothing. I got in once MORE and tried another game when the alert of the crashing issue was no longer there but it crashed again. This resulted in me losing promos and getting 10 minute queues for 5 games.\n\nThis all happened yesterday. Now i tried to launch after 10 tries of getting to the login, i got to start up a game (but waited 10 minutes do to punishments). Everything was fine and my game CRASHED again saying there is a bugsplat . Now i see that riot has posted a bugsplat issue. This 3rd game crashing will for sure end up in a suspension when I most certainly do not deserve it. \n\nPlease help!\n\nJust to inform you as well, i have even re-installed Lol and am still having the login issue.","replies":[]}]}]}
