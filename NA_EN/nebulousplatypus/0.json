EU is lower but still ~30%. However, I looked at Korean banrates and it&#039;s less than 1.5% for WW. That&#039;s such an enormous difference. What explains this?\r\n\r\nI remember seeing this video about WW bugs: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdCcW5FRY4U Maybe that&#039;s the problem? I kind of expected every region to have somewhat similar banrates for champions. I know WW doesn&#039;t see competitive play but he&#039;s pretty good in SQ.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-03-14T05:00:41.470+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":3,"body":"NA players are bad and ban things that annoy them.","replies":[{"poster":"Akaviri","date":"2018-03-14T16:52:02.104+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"NA seems to have problems dealing with certain champs, or boards would have you think so. Twitch, a champion that gets complained about a lot, is among the least popular ADCs in KR currently.
