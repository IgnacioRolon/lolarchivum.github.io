I live in Michigan and for about the past year I would get a consistent 23 ping without packet loss. Now I get a 32 ms ping average, and while there is still no packet loss, I don't understand why my ping is 10 higher than it was before, and I am looking for a way to get it back to the original ping. \r\n\r\nHere are my statistics from WinMTR:\r\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\r\n|                                      WinMTR statistics                                   |\r\n|                       Host              -   %  | Sent | Recv | Best | Avrg | Wrst | Last |\r\n|------------------------------------------------|------|------|------|------|------|------|\r\n|                                10.0.0.1 -    0 |  302 |  302 |    2 |   11 |   43 |   13 |\r\n|                            96.120.40.81 -    0 |  302 |  302 |    9 |   13 |   66 |   13 |\r\n|                           68.86.141.213 -    0 |  302 |  302 |    8 |   13 |   66 |   14 |\r\n|                           68.87.189.133 -    0 |  302 |  302 |   12 |   16 |   70 |   15 |\r\n|be-33668-cr02.ashburn.va.ibone.comcast.net -    0 |  302 |  302 |   24 |   29 |   82 |   29 |\r\n|be-10189-pe07.ashburn.va.ibone.comcast.net -    0 |  302 |  302 |   23 |   27 |   80 |   24 |\r\n|               e0-0.cr01.atl01.mzima.net -    0 |  302 |  302 |   26 |   31 |  103 |   28 |\r\n|                          104.160.137.35 -    0 |  302 |  302 |   26 |   30 |   83 |   26 |\r\n|          ae35-br01.chi01.riotdirect.net -    0 |  302 |  302 |   25 |   30 |   78 |   28 |\r\n|                           104.160.131.1 -    0 |  302 |  302 |   25 |   29 |   82 |   26 |\r\n|________________________________________________|______|______|______|______|______|______|\r\n   WinMTR v0.92 GPL V2 by Appnor MSP - Fully Managed Hosting &amp; Cloud Provider","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-12-22T17:58:12.398+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It looks like your higher ping is starting within your own home network, so it's getting a poor start before leaving your own router.  Are you on wi-fi at all?  If so, that could definitely be a culprit so switching to wired may help.  Just in case, see if [power cycling ](https://kb.netgear.com/19755/How-to-Power-Cycle-Your-Home-Network?cid=wmt_netgear_organic)your router might help here.  I hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
