I  live in Michigan and would get consistent 23 ping, and now my ping is around 34 when playing League. It's a consistent ping, there isn't fluctuation, but I was wondering if there was any reason for this increase in MS or a way to fix it. I have Comcast as a provider, and as far as I'm aware they don't do any connection throttling with all the recent net neutrality hubbub.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-12-13T17:45:53.042+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your ISP's routing to the game server may have changed or struggling, but we can get a traceroute to get more details.
