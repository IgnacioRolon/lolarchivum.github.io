My Q becomes my W, my W becomes my E and on rare occasions it'll go into maximum overdrive and my Q will be my R. It's had some rather... interesting results. \r\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}} \r\nSo far the only fix I've come up with is recalling, DCing and then quickly reconnecting.\r\nI read a previous thread about a similar happening and the advice given was to delete the config file and reset... However it didn't seem to work.\r\n\r\nIt may just be a me issue however I thought it would be a good idea to bring this up. I'll give some details as to what specs I have for hardware so if it is a me issue I can look more into this.\r\n \r\nMy bindings in league are:\r\nstandard: Q W E R \r\ntrinket: 4\r\nItems: Z X C V MB5 MB4 \r\n\r\nMy specs are:\r\nKeyboard: Logitech Orion Spark G910\r\nMouse: Logitech Probeus Spectrum G502\r\n\r\nThank you for your time.","replies":[{"poster":"Her Oathsworn","date":"2017-07-20T18:31:34.757+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It worked, everything is working smoothly because of that fix!

This could happen if you're being haunted :P or your config is corrupt.  Resetting your config settings should fix this up:\n\nLog into the game client.\nNavigate to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config\nDelete the file  named **game.cfg** and **persistedsettings.json**\nGo into a custom game and verify that settings have saved properly.  Leave game to sync settings. \n\nLet me know if that helps!","replies":[]}]}
