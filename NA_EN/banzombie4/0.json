I&#039;ve never seen a more concentrated group of whiny brats.  You and your kind are always looking for the next opportunity to play the victim card.  Always looking for the next opportunity to be offended by something. And 99% of the time the things you choose to be victims of and offended by are so trivial and fleetingly topical that I can&#039;t help but to laugh and pity you at the same time, because this truly is what your existence on this planet has become.  Your scope and grasp on the big picture outside of your computer screen doesn&#039;t exist, it&#039;s probably a good thing you never leave the basement because you wouldn&#039;t last a second if an honest to god challenge was put before you.","replies":[]}
