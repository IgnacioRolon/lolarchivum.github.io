I first downloaded it from the normal launcher and it would crash at 80% of the game download in the client, I kept retrying and had the same issue (Error 004). I tried on the Oceania Mac installer but the same issue occurred. I have been trying to find solutions for about 3 days and I don't want to have to turn to the other game some of my friends play... D-DOTA 2... Regardless of jokes, and in all seriousness, I really need help with this. If you find a working solution I would really appreciate you helping me out with this, because I have always wanted to get into a MOBA but this issue is stopping me from getting in one of the only ones my friends play.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-21T17:30:23.187+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry for the trouble's you've been facing here.  :(  Most common cases of issues like this, especially on Macs, are caused by an unstable connection getting cut off from our patching service.
