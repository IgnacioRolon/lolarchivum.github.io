In my experience on voice chat, it's not uncommon for someone to only say a MIA instead of ping it. In looking at the LCS it's not uncommon to do the generic blue dot ping (since that's faster) and say what you mean. Combine both of that with having to mute someone and you're completely I'm the dark if you mute a player.\n\nAnd before you say \"people will continue to ping\", remember how much of a stir has been going on over auto fill, a \"feature\" we basically had for 5 years and was only missing 1 year. People get use to the lazier system (only 2 roles, speaking and blue ping) and won't continue to practice the other way (other 3 roles, using all the pings). Take a few videos of pinging today and compare it to 1 year after voice chat comes out, I promise there will be fewer.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2017-03-31T13:39:23.331+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You have to set up a discord chat though, that means inviting people, people you might play with again. \n\nThere are a lot of people you never want to have the ability to ever contact you.","replies":[{"poster":"Mizuki Zahra","date":"2017-03-31T13:55:53.521+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"just think of all of the all chat hate speech and gang ups","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Oleandervine","date":"2017-03-31T13:55:03.693+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"It won't drop that much, and a lot of it will just shift from written in game to spoken over VO.

People wanted to choose their roles, they got role section now nobody argues with that. People wanted replay systems, they got it and nobody complains about that (excluding the annoying inability to share). People wanted the practice tool and nobody argues with that (excluding the inability to play with others). As shown by those previous demands of players, when Riot actually gives in to them the overall reply is positive. Even if you add the inconsistencies with all those demands they are still widely considered better than not having them implemented in the first place. Will Voice Coms be perfect? 100% no, but I do think it will be widely accepted by the playerbase considering many have asked for it for years especially when Overwatch came out.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Touch My Box","date":"2017-03-31T13:37:28.706+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"Of course it would, especially with a mute feature.\n\nCry-It are just stupid and can't do anything right.\n\n\nThey seem to mismanage everything.","replies":[]}]}
