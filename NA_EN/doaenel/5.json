There's some exceptions like {{champion:37}} who is a mix between a burst mage and an Enchanter (but she needs a rework anyway). What that means if that Rio designed and will design other supports with this guide in mind.\n\nThe ''Fantastic Four'' however, were not designed with this mindset because they were designed for **midlane** mages in the update. And because the said update made them less dependant on ap items, their previous early game weakness was removed while also keeping their mid game powerspike and late game threat. And btw, the early game at bot lane is very, very important because this is want it's decide who is going to be feed or who is going to be put in the ground. I didn't even mention the ''nerf'' to Rylai that decreased his cost, making a very cost efficient items (and when you live with a budget, the low cost make the decision for you).\n\n What does it means? That means  if you play against an ap ''support'' mage, you are starting with a disavantage when the game **did not even begin.** If you play a normal support, unless the jungler camps your lane or they somehow fuck up, **you will lose every single 2 vs 2 because there's 2 person that does dmg now.** You can pick any supports that you want, it will not work: \n\nAn enchanter? The ap support doesn't have the fear to be all-in (since most enchanters are defensive) so they poke you or your adc for free (unless you can manage to poke them back a little bit) and all-in you whatever they can (unless your jungler is there and he's able to do something).\n\nA disrupter? Now you can all-in them but you don't have enough substain to endure their spells which means unless both you and your adc managed to dodge almost everything, you won't be able to all-in.\n\nA warden? Good luck even trying to approach minions without getting poke.\n\nOf course, they wouldn't be that much of an issue if they had no CC. But because mages need at least one spell that has CC in order to keep assasins at bay. And unfortunately, **all you need to be viable as a support pick is to have at least one CC (which is why {{champion:90}} is viable as a support)**\n\nWhy would you pick shield and heals when you can poke your enemies from afar? Why would  you need hooks and displacements when you can stun or root the assasin while also dealing HUGE amount of dmgs to them. Why you need to protect the adc by being a meat shield when you can use the best way to protect them: death (I wish that would stay as a meme).\n\nThat's why they overshadow the support role.\n\nBtw, I'm NOT saying that they are op. Far from it actually, it just that they kill the diversity and the early game can be a pain in the ***.","replies":[{"poster":"An Undead brat","date":"2017-03-13T19:20:19.547+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm sorry, I don't have time to read all od that, but I don't even need to because you are just repeating the same damn thing...

He also had (before it was nerfed) a strong blocking ability for many incoming threats like {{champion:412}} and {{champion:111}} hooks (his voidlings (W) could block them with their near instant, on-click spawn). He also has an AOE silence and his voidlings can also be used to scout brush to see if there is an enemy hiding within it. His passive also is a great blocker for 90% of any incoming threat and 100% of incoming CC when up.

The fact that you actually have to fight the opponent to gain gold is much healthier and interesting than giving gold for every time you heal while sitting back under tower. I think the REAL PROBLEM with Frost queen's claim is that you can trigger it multiple times with one DOT ability.  You should get one proc per spell, such that you must work hard to earn that gold. Whether there should be mages or not in bot is not a problem with Frost Queen's claim itself.\n\nThat said, I think there is merit to your idea.  It would be interesting if utility supports were encouraged to use their heals and shields in engaging ways rather than turtling.  For example,what if you gained gold every time a shield you applied took damage? It would have the same \"turns off if you CS\" effect as frost queen, but encourages you to work with your carry to actively engage and gain gold.  And if you are behind and getting bullied, you will still find plenty of chances to gain gold.  It could work similarly for healing.  If you heal an ally and they take damage again within 5 seconds, or if you heal an ally below 50% hp you would gain gold.\n\nWith regards to mages in bot lane, either heal supports need to become more popular (they counter the mage poke tactics) or if that isn't enough then tank supports need a cheap item that builds out of spectral cowl.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Espy Psyche","date":"2017-03-12T18:36:30.136+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":16,"body":"Mage supports are the solution, not a problem.

You have an error because you are thinking the the label should be honored when it is the label that is erroneous.\n\nALSO: since nobody knows what support is including you, \"support is support\" is a good example of a nonsense cyclic argument with no meaning. Proof if you knew what support is you would not use \"support is support\" as an argument you'd use a descriptive one.

The outliers do not make the rule.","replies":[{"poster":"Aptest","date":"2017-03-13T13:39:46.312+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> 3) When mages start going bot lane because they have a shit ton of base damage and can burst the enemy down, it causes those supports to be shoved out of the meta and have nowhere else to go.\n\nThis has two parts.\n\nWhen new characters become viable in a lane, all the existing characters in that lane take a play-rate hit. because some of the players choose to play Trundle or Zyra or Brand over playing Soraka. \n\nif I switched from Soraka to Brand because i liked Brand's play style in general but could not play him on my favorite lane because lack of gold, that's not a bad thing. Yes Soraka got pushed out, but it's not a bad case of pushed out, it's a good one - I the player benefited from having access to the more fun character. \n\nif OTOH i really like Soraka but she's simply becoming not viable and every time I see brand picked or if i don't know who the other support is I can't pick her, than that's a bad thing because i don't get to play a character I like simply because she's not good. \n\nPlease also consider that what the ADC wants or what the jungler wants is not relevant in this discussion. The ADC player doesn't have a dog in the race of who he gets as a support. I mean he does but i don't think the argument of I don't like the enemy support blasting me please make the other guy play around protecting his own carry instead of killing me holds any water. \n\nSo I guess the real question is not if Brand support replaces Soraka support, but rather if he is doing a \"good replacement\" (the support player gets to play a more fun chracter) or a \"bad replacement\" (the support player can't play his favorite champion due to unsuitability).\n\nfrom the opposite angle, how much of Soraka's play rate is \"good play rate\" (I really like Soraka and enjoy her), and how much of it is \"bad play rate\" (I wish i could play something else but Soraka is super good right now)? Is the increase in Brand support play a symptom of removing \"bad play rate\" from Soraka? or removing \"good play rate\"? \n\nIf I look at champion.gg, the tradisional caster supports (Soraka, Janna, Lulu, Karma, Nami) have the high play rates, and also they have good win rates. Whereas damage supports have small play rate and are a mixed bag, win% wise.\n\nSince \"supporty supports\" are shown to be good and popular, and the options that replace them are generally less good and less popular, I can only come to the conclusion that the \"Brand supports\" you've been seeing is a case of \"Soraks's bad play rate\" getting replaced with Brand's \"good play rate\".","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
