I&#039;ve asked the enemy team to report her for verbal abuse, but they all refused since it was not in all chat. Honestly, I&#039;d like this to be upvoted so a Rioter could see this and take action against this player. I&#039;ve asked my team to report her also, but she is playing with a few of them, so they won&#039;t report her. The reason this is on the boards is because I know that a player usually need 3-5 reports to get punished, and I don&#039;t believe this will be achieved. For any of those interested, I am playing Kindred, below are the timestamps for the &#039;kys&#039;, please note that saying kys was not the only verbal abuse delivered by her.\r\n\r\n12:17 14:06 16:15","replies":[{"poster":"Mod Curator","date":"2016-06-28T23:30:36.756+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"It only takes one report to trigger the system to review a player's game.
