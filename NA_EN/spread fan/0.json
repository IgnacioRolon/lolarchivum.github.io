We both decided to buy XP boosts and in a matter of hours we were lvl 15, so we spend a fairly amount of time and money. As I reload my client due to a interface bug, the client greets me with a big message suggesting I have to verify my email. Well, happens that this account was linked to my old college, and it is not possible to access anymore since they shut down the servers. I know the common thing to do is to submit a request by ticket on Support but you need to have a verified account to do so...\r\n\r\nIs there something I can do? I don't want to lose what I achieved so far because I couldn't verify my email in the past. I really appreciate any help you guys could write. \r\n\r\nThanks :)","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-23T20:33:37.037+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can still shoot us a ticket without being signed in. Hit up the [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) page and make sure you pick \"I need help recovering my account\" and that should let you submit a ticket without being logged in. After verifying yourself as the account creator, those agents should be able to help you out with that email.","replies":[]}]}
