That will completely turn off the client when you're actually playing a match, which will free up some resources so your pc can run more smoothly. We could also try doing a [**clean boot**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974#wq7) to see if that helps much.\n\nHit us back up and let me know if that helps much or not!","replies":[{"poster":"ChiefE","date":"2017-04-29T03:46:45.611+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I tried the closing client during game thing, it didn't change fps any discernible amount... it's a 16 thread processor as well and considering League only uses 2 cores I would certainly hope background process weren't the issue XD.\n\nAlso, I had already tried a clean boot when checking to see if my drive speed was the issue(originally was on a SATA 3 SSD with slower read rates) - it slightly improved performance but it's still an issue.
