You posted about half an hour ago, and your match history shows you've played 11 games today.  **Not one of your games has a botlane with a possible 0/18 pre-20 laning phase.**\n\n[This match](http://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/1730223711/35864146?tab=overview) (which started over 3 1/2 hours ago at the very latest due to game durations) is close, but only has 8 of your ADC/support deaths in lane pre-20.\n\n[This match](http://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/1730413020/35864146?tab=overview) shows an ADC with deaths almost solely in lane and a support with deaths split between bot and mid, but your ADC killed the enemy ADC before 10 minutes so that can't be an 0/18 duo pre-20.  **Interestingly, you went 0/9/0 (no assists!) and gave up the first two kills of the game.**","replies":[{"poster":"NecromasterQ","date":"2015-02-15T06:07:29.249+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"not the same game.  the game which i was reffering  i won lane   didn't die in lane phase  and killed  1v1  my lane enemy.  nice try","replies":[{"poster":"NecromasterQ","date":"2015-02-15T06:08:27.467+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"also  you're glossing overr the fact that  not only  ez   died 8 times..  but  the janna who was duo with him died 10 times in  lane phase...","replies":[{"poster":"NecromasterQ","date":"2015-02-15T06:11:38.143+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i don't remember them ever  coming mid.   but if they did  they  subsequently  died again on purpose.   which again  makes my point   the fact that these players die  in multiple lanes on purpose is not punished nearly as swiftly as  a d'c.  or just leaving the game entirely...  which i will say is pretty shity..  but if its not  your choice..  is that really  the same?     how is it  ok  to punish  many players  immediately  for a d'c   and not for feeding?","replies":[{"poster":"NecromasterQ","date":"2015-02-15T06:18:20.900+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"INTERESTINGLY, you  don't  even have the  stats right on  what you're  trying to proclaim.

You.\n\nI looked at every one of your games from the day in which you \"just had a bot lane feed 0/18.\"  Your other games where you had a good score are irrelevant to the topic.\n\nObjectively, the games that *are* relevant are the ones in which your botlane did poorly (\"18  deaths  before 20 mins in A RANKED GAME\") and you lost (\"gj riot thanks for losing me lp.\").  Do you know why?  They help establish whether or not you're a reliable narrator.  If you had a recent game that had a 0/18 botlane by the 20 minute mark, you might've been telling the truth.\n\n**Not a single one of them backed up your claim.**  Not only did you exaggerate your teammates' poor performance by *a lot*, but your own performance is pretty suspicious.  How often does a champ with a global ult not manage to get a single assist?  You claimed that other people on your team were feeding, but since you died more than once before their first deaths in the game with the closest match to your story *and* they managed a larger than 0% kill participation (which you did not), I'm not sure you can blame your loss on *them* feeding.","replies":[{"poster":"NecromasterQ","date":"2015-02-15T06:04:42.522+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"not a single  one of what?   are you  kidding?   let us establish this iceweasel. you're saying not one of my games in my recent or any other  history backs up my claim of having intentional feeders?  have you watched everyone one of these games ?  good and bad?   or  are you just  positioning yourself on the stats you can see?    have you  investigated  reports on the players  i'm accusing of this action?  or just  me  because i'm typing about the issue?   further,  you're stating that the only games that back up my claims are about  JUST BOT LANE.  this is also false as i play all roles.  and  it's  not JUST BOT LANE  that i am stating, feeds.   its all roles.   or don't back up my claims.

You're the one who specifically claimed that you \"just had a bot lane feed 0/18...before 20 mins in A RANKED GAME...thanks for losing me lp.\"\n\nThis means your argument relies on:\n\n* you having a botlane that fed 0/18\n* the 0/18 score being achieved before 20 minutes\n* you losing the game\n* the game being very recent\n\nI'll repeat that again since I know you're going to ask why I am focused on your botlane.\n\n**You blamed your 0/18 pre-20 minute botlane for your loss.**\n\nHere's what your match history shows for the 11 games played that day before your post:\n\n* Zero games with a 0/18 pre-20 minute botlane\n* Two games with a struggling botlane\n\nI don't need to see a replay of your games to know that.  The match history shows deaths, kills, locations, and approximate times of each.  Considering your wording (\"just had\"), the game in question had to have happened very recently, thus the limitation of games on the same day.  The most recent game at the time of your post was your Blitzcrank win.  **You only had two games with heavy losses in your botlane, which I linked.**\n\nIn the game at least 3 1/2 hours before your original post, your botlane's relevant stats were:\n\n* ADC: 4/16/7\n* Support: 9/12/9\n* Combined KDA at 20 minutes: 1/7/?\n* Timestamp for 18 deaths reached: beyond 33 minutes with 5/19/? \n* Majority of deaths occurred after laning phase, scattered around the map\n\nIn the other game I linked, which was your most recent loss at the time of your post, your botlane's relevant stats were:\n\n* ADC: 2/8/1\n* Support: 2/9/2\n* Combined KDA at 20 minutes: 3/11/?\n* Timestamp for 18 deaths reached: Never\n* 75% of ADC's deaths occurred in lane\n* Over half of support's deaths occurred in lane\n\nThis game seems like the most likely candidate for the game you were describing in your original post.  Here's why:\n\n* It was the most recent loss\n* It was shorter, with a decisive end before 25 minutes\n* Most of your botlane's deaths happened *in the botlane*\n* Total botlane deaths (17) is almost the 18 you stated\n* Total botlane deaths were closer to 18 at 20 minutes\n* Your botlane ended with only 4 kills total, which is closer to 0 than the other game's botlane (13)\n\nSo to answer your question, when I say not a single one of your games backs up your claim, I'm talking about the fact that **not a single one of your games actually has a botlane that does what you said**.  Do you understand?  If you claimed your botlane fed 0/18 before 20 minutes and none of your games show that happening, then **none of your games back up your claim**.  I never said you had no feeders in your game, because there was definitely at least one.\n\n* Total KDA: 0/9/0\n* You gave first blood *and* second blood\n* Total Damage to Champions: 1.0k (support dealt 5.5x that amount)\n* Magic Damage to Champions: 0.1k (100 magic damage total with Gangplank?)\n* Minions Killed: 13 (If you were playing support this would be understandable, but you were top)\n\nOf course you want to blame someone *else* for feeding to excuse your loss.  It couldn't have been you, could it?\n\nExcept it's blatantly obvious that it was.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"NecromasterQ","date":"2015-02-15T06:32:55.976+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"so  one game whether exaggerated or not is not my  main issue.  though, you seem intent on picking it apart. the issue i've tried to address is that  a d'c or  a leave is punished  immediately now.  with  longer and  longer que times.  ok  cool.  i agree with this.  but  intentional feeding is not punished in nearly  the same manner.  why not?  it is just as bad as leaving a game entirely.  so  you're punished for leaving a game.  not playing at all..    but not for   running into lane and  giving  deaths arbitrarily all game.  why not?  its worse.","replies":[]},{"poster":"NecromasterQ","date":"2015-02-15T05:58:00.639+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"not a single  one of what?   are you  kidding?   let us establish this iceweasel. you're saying not one of my games in my recent or any other  history backs up my claim of having intentional feeders?  have you watched everyone one of these games ?  good and bad?   or  are you just  positioning yourself on the stats you can see?    have you  investigated  reports on the players  i'm accusing of this action?  or just  me  because i'm typing about the issue?   funny","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Darkmind1212","date":"2015-02-15T03:01:54.017+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I have this odd feeling that you scream at your teams a lot.","replies":[{"poster":"Killer X 12","date":"2015-02-15T03:22:34.544+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea i feel like i wouldn't want him on my team.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"NecromasterQ","date":"2015-02-15T04:37:03.997+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"seems like i scream at people a lot.   lol    you realiz this is typing right? i can't scream at anyone.  i  always  give positive reinforcement  for  good plays.    sometimes, like everyone,  i can be accused fairly  of  being toxic.    but i try not to type  while playing.    i understand  its not  conducive to  put down fellow players.   but if they  die over and over   knowing they can't  win....? what is that like religion.?  we  know its wrong  but cant speak of it... or punish it?     seems  pretty  shity to me","replies":[{"poster":"Ice Weasel X","date":"2015-02-15T05:05:33.746+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=NecromasterQ,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=V9BanVVA,comment-id=0006,timestamp=2015-02-15T04:37:03.997+0000)\n>\n> seems like i scream at people a lot.   lol    you realiz this is typing right? i can't scream at anyone.\n\nSemantics.
