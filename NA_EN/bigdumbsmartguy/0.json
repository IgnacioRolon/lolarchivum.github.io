If you're running, they'll throw it to intercept you. If you're fighting, they'll throw it on top of themselves. Just move a few units and resume.

After a certain point, you and your opponent are going to be of the same strength. Unless its a horrible mismatch, it becomes more and more of capitalizing on your opponent's errors.\n\nBut that's a bit higher than most people. So for options that YOU can do, just make sure to play smart, not hard. Ekko may be strong, but he's only as good as the person using him. If he throws Q on you, back away. If he follows up with E, turn around and engage him. If he winds up for W, predict where it will go.

He's better. The amount of utility he has on his kit and the nature of his ultimate means he he doesn't just have to make A mistake, he has to make two. At LEAST two. You can play Ekko very poorly and still kick the shit out of the enemy team. I know because it's happened to me. I could point out mistakes and poor plays the enemy Ekko was making, but it didn't matter because my teammates were still melting under his burst and unable to catch him afterward.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Anotherherolost","date":"2015-05-29T14:45:43.569+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Narasimha,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=8FinaUEO,comment-id=00000000000100000000,timestamp=2015-05-29T14:31:20.061+0000)\n>\n> Not at all.

He threw his W on you at the beginning of the fight which is getting ready to stun you and shield him at right about the time your trying to fight back. With Lich proced + his passive + his W passive + extra damage on E he dealS a metric fuck ton. \n\nI completely agree with all those counter picks, if your having trouble with him being in every game, take one of those champions.

I don't think thats a good guage for Ekkos power, plus if you think about viktor, hes kind of a great counter for Ekko. He can keep his distance, shield himself when Ekko tries to burst, lay his gravity field inside Ekkos chronoshpere effectivly making it useless bc he cant get the shield w.o getting stunned and he cant engage a stunned viktor in it without also getting stunned. Im sure by mid game viktors lazer was chunking half of Ekkos health too.  \n\nHes certainly being exaggurated but he is very strong. Too many people carrying with this \"High skill floor\" champion on day 1. His floor is pretty low, you really just have to poke with q until there at half health (Roughly 2 double hits) and then E them to bring them under 30% and smack em with an auto and there dead.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"HeraldOfDemacia","date":"2015-05-29T12:31:37.411+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Seems to me like you either have to play brand and somewhat predict his movements, or play another assassin and abandon the lane at 6 to roam.

His mobility is for engaging, so you can get free hits if he last hits minions with melee, and he can't safely dive you with only E.\nAlso, if you push to his side, he can overlap his ulti on you to deal massive burst, but if the lane is near your turret, he has to save ulti for dives or to retreat from ganks, losing a lot of damage. Don't aim for the kill, he is a very safe champion, out farm him and force him to recall or build mana instead of damage.\n\nPlace wards in your jungle as he roams quite easily, if he does roam, and you know where the jungleer is, follow him. If he engages bot and needs to escape, stay near (no on) his shadow for free finishing blows. If he is running away, DON'T Chase, he jukes worse than wukong and Yasuo.

He will try to slyly place his stun over you, and he can ulti on the spot for massive burst. Poke and retreat, hit him while he farms, he has no sustain, so he has no way to get that HP back, unless he wants to waste ulti. Mana regen doesn't synergise with his kit well, bait his skill shots and dodge them, if he is low on mana he can only recall, as he can't even use ulti to escape anymore. \n\nIf you are ahead, let the wave push, then go aggro on him. force him to ulti early and he won't even be able to last hit a couple minions, he will be forced to recall entirely, Fiora is good at this. If he goes top, Fiora and Darius (if played really well) can punish him, panth as well, if he is mid, most assassins like LB will be able to bait and punish him for trying to farm, and stop him snowballing. \n\nHaven't gone up against a yas yet, but Zed and Lb should beat him. \n\nSo yeah, biggest tip, like with Kata, watch out for his roaming, and cut off his farm, he will become useless.
