I mean more progression lore, especially if it takes place in the current time like the Confessions. I think serialized fiction would fit such a format better than a long story. Every part of Confessions hit the Reddit front page and was in the top 15 posts in the least even though there was no big reveal to accompany it so there was obviously some great interest for it. This makes it all the more impressive. \n\nAnother reason (other than it being serialized progression) why it garnered so much interest was because it involved an interaction between Yasuo and Riven, two popular champions. So I think progression lore involving at least two champions than just one champion and an original character would be way more popular. Something Vi or Caitlyn investigating a crime in Piltover or maybe Lucian coming across Kalista in Shadow Isles. Or maybe some internal conflict with Talon and Katarina concerning Du Couteau.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Oleandervine","date":"2018-10-02T00:04:43.246+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Scathlocke,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=hTtxEaM4,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2018-10-02T00:03:44.935+0000)\n>\n> Do you mean serialised fiction?

Except that killer isn't a champion in the game - yet. Pyke would have been beautiful for this. It would have led to a wonderful reveal.","replies":[{"poster":"DarkSoul1994","date":"2018-10-02T06:35:18.539+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe non-cannon lore if Riot ever did a Jack The Ripper Pyke skin?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ifneth","date":"2018-10-03T23:31:07.562+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Scathlocke,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=hTtxEaM4,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2018-10-02T00:03:44.935+0000)\n>\n> Do you mean serialised fiction?

Stories that end where they began are boring.\n\nThe civil war arcs are the most important.  Shurima and the Freljord are in chaos, full of complicated relationships and heading for a dramatic change of government.  Personally, I hope that Ashe unites the Freljord and Taliyah inspires Shurimans to form a Republic after defeating Xerath and Renekton alongside Nasus, Sivir, and Azir.  Also Ashe and Tryndamereâ€™s marriage and Taliyah reuniting with her tribe for the warm and fuzzies. :3","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"VoraciousX","date":"2018-10-02T06:57:33.702+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Aside from the whole thing of the freak accident causing Yasuo's master to die rather than a more surprising twist I agree.

I found that ironic given how they already condemned yasuo back then\n\nI agree that Riven should have killed the elder and later regret it with all the killings she has blindly done. That was the whole point of her character that she realised she was in the wrong and tried to find a way to mend things and follow her own path. She was presented as someone who would forge her own path but here she quite easily ended up chilling in ionia which is strange. I mean if she really feels ashamed and guilty how can she allow that old couple call her daughter? Shouldnt she keep them at a distance as she herself cant forgive herself? I feel riven was a complicated character who would have required several stories to solve but riot took a lazy way and deleted half her personality. \nShe still may end up doing stuff but i dont think riot can bend her lore in a way that it wouldnt feel forced.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Zapzya","date":"2018-10-01T01:09:18.940+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"I hope so, I would kill for small character progressions like that.","replies":[]}]}
