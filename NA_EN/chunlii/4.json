Probably a warmason to gather information on the runes, or an assassin/infiltrator of some sort. ~~Perhaps a fiery redhead who manages to sneak her way into the heart of a local Demacian hero so we can finally LET THE SHIP SET SA~~. Come to think of it, Noxus doesn't really have an assassin who operates primarily in the wild, someone comparable to Quinn... There's the implied rivalry with Talon, sure, but he's more of a parkour and cityscape assassin now...\n\nAnd that's all assuming there's NO WAY for Noxus to launch an attack to obtain the Runes. Noxus seems to be getting close in the south, and we know from Quinn's color story that some scouts have reached out that far. They could potentially expand that way and send their forces overland, so long as Piltover/Zaun agree to stay neutral in the conflict. It'd be slow going to get to Demacia, but all of those problems with Piltover you just listed suddenly become DEMACIA'S problem instead.\n\nThe two nations are close enough to mutually consider each other rivals, which implies skirmishes in the past, and/or attempts at influence that the other screwed up (proxy engagements, something like the USSR vs USA during the cold war).","replies":[{"poster":" Queen Of Yuri","date":"2018-07-29T04:13:54.505+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"but the real questions is which local demacians heart she would getting into if you know what I mean ;D","replies":[{"poster":"HalfTangible","date":"2018-07-29T20:33:50.562+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:50}} :  \"YOU MARRIED HIM?!\"\n{{champion:55}} : \"You told me to get into his heart and see what makes it tick!\"\n{{champion:50}} : \"THAT IS NOT WHAT I MEANT\"\n\n\n\n\n\n{{champion:69}} : \"...
