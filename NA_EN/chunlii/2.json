I’m old enough that that stuff was kinda just getting realsed in the usa for the first time, when i was an early teen. \n\n  I also like: one piece, Naruto, and blade of the immortal, but i was in college when i got into them.\n\nThe only kinda esoteric thing i loved was “Short Program” by mitsuru adachi..  book 1 is tied with Akira as my favorite.  Just a book of realworld human short stories— but really heartly warming.","replies":[{"poster":"Larriet","date":"2019-02-24T16:41:25.970+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm 21 years old and have been reading since I was in 5th grade; it's still kind of weird to me that stuff like that used to be the mainstream in the U.S., while nowadays things align way more closely with Japan (i.e. stuff for teenagers is the most popular; Viz media literally publishes Shonen Jump concurrently with Japan which is wild).  Rumiko Takahashi examples aside, of course.\n\nI've had a couple Mitsuru Adachi works in my to read [EDIT: no \"too rad\" lol] list (mainly because he's a big name in sports stories), but that looks interesting now that I've seen it.  It's going near the top of the list for now.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"EROTIC RAID BOSS","date":"2019-02-24T11:34:10.551+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"not enough grant morrison","replies":[{"poster":"Jaspers","date":"2019-02-24T12:17:12.239+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My brother and me were talking the other day about how poor Marvel comics are at the moment (I say this as I don't know about right now as stopped reading a couple of years back, Hickman and Bendis ruined things), Grant Morrison's X-men era was so good.

His X-men (along side Hickman's Avengers/Secret Wars) is what made me stop reading and I'm finding it hard to get back into X-men after so many years reading them, as things change so much so quickly. I hated the 'Young' X-men, they weren't the O5, Jean was a horrible person. Weirdly I enjoyed his last few issues on Uncanny.\n\nRemender's stuff was okay. Gillen and Fraction always did good stuff. Hickman's Avenger stuff was drivel, read like it was written by a 13 yr old writing fan fiction, \"We need to get bigger.\" repeated over and over. Mike Carey did, superb work.\n\nNow Brian K Vaughan on the other hand, there is a man who can write comics, Ed Brubaker too.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Warlord Dienekes","date":"2019-02-24T15:40:51.945+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I always find Morrison a coin flip.
