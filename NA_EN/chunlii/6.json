But the dangers and temptations are great- if they don't save Runterra, they will be the ones to break it. And who/what are they resisting?\n\nTHE VILLAINS\n\nDark deals and shadowy meetings gave rise to The Riders and The Storm. Morgana, The Fallen Angel, contacted Kayn, Varus, Aatrox, the Darkin of the Depths, and the Darkin in the North and set out  her plan: total domination and rule. To the unwise it would seem their campaign would merely bring destruction, but that is only to clear the way for their dark empire. With powerful magic, The Riders(that is, Morgana and the Darkin) have conjured The Storm, otherworldly beings from the depths of The Void and the grave, and unleashed them across Runeterra. An epoch of darkness and war awaits humanity, and the time to stop it is running out.\n\nRANDOM HEADCANON\n-Jayce has a thing for Kai'Sa, though she is quick to shut his advances down. Is making a weaponized armor suit for her in secret.\n\n-Swain is plotting to take the magic The Riders are using and turn it against them. Only Kayle knows this, but she merely advises to keep a close eye on Swain.\n\n-Ryze has many internal debates over whether he should turn his world-breaking magic against The Riders or play it safe. Poppy tries to cheer him up with jokes and fails miserably.\n\n-Leona is the one Poppy is closest to on the team consciously making an effort to appear as a Yordle in private with her. The two have long conversations late at night about heroism and heroes.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wrathof300","date":"2018-02-21T01:24:43.958+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Main Team: {{champion:86}} {{champion:3}} {{champion:83}} {{champion:164}} {{champion:18}} {{champion:98}} {{champion:39}} \nGuardians of the Galaxy: {{champion:80}} {{champion:142}} {{champion:44}} {{champion:16}} {{champion:432}}{{champion:136}} {{champion:10}} \nRocket and Groot: {{champion:240}} and {{champion:427}} \nHulk: {{champion:150}}, Wolverine: {{champion:19}}, Black Panther: {{champion:107}}, Doctor Strange: {{champion:13}}\nNew Generation team: {{champion:245}} {{champion:163}} {{champion:84}} {{champion:141}}  {{champion:99}} {{champion:222}} {{champion:497}} and {{champion:498}}\n\nThanos: {{champion:82}}","replies":[{"poster":"Talvaren","date":"2018-02-21T07:17:27.949+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"so who does the main team represent?","replies":[{"poster":"Wrathof300","date":"2018-02-21T23:19:10.652+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just went with who from as many regions as possible would have made sense to be on a League of Legends Avengers team, didn't go to in depth,  {{champion:86}} = Captain America was as far as I got.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Darius Strada","date":"2018-02-21T18:37:57.242+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:86}} {{champion:154}} {{champion:201}} {{champion:245}} {{champion:78}} {{champion:44}}{{champion:163}} ","replies":[]},{"poster":"Glaistig Uaine","date":"2018-02-21T18:30:55.029+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:86}}  Big Guy\n\n{{champion:62}} Leader\n\n{{champion:26}} Smart Guy\n\n{{champion:67}} Lancer\n\n{{champion:99}} Heart\n\nAuxiliary members: \n\n{{champion:163}} When she's not busy protecting her tribe.\n\n{{champion:51}} When she's not busy being a policewoman.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dokueki Kenshin","date":"2018-02-21T18:26:39.555+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"See, when I think of the Avengers (more specifically, the MCU Avengers), one of the main things that I connect with them is a general lack of political/government affiliation. While it is true that most of them in canon are American citizens, their responsibility is primarily to the people of the world. With that in mind, I made my list of champions centered around those with few few or no true political allegiances:\n\n{{champion:13}}: This one is kinda obvious to me. He’s responsible for recovering the World Runes. He has no allegiance to any nation of any sort and works solely to protect the world.\n\n{{champion:24}}: Jax is a battle-crazed veteran from a now non-existant nation that simply lives to fight and find a good challenge. Simple-minded but definitely seems like he’d fight for the greater good for enough hard-boiled eggs.\n\n{{champion:150}}: I don’t think I have to spell this one out. Hulk Smash.\n\n{{champion:81}}: Technically Piltovian, but doesn’t really care about where he’s from and is an overall nice guy... Even if he is a bit cocky at sometimes.\n\n{{champion:44}}: Taric is literally responsible for protecting all of Valoran. Protecting Runeterra, in turn, would protect Valoran.\n\n{{champion:10}}: Literally not from Runeterra and has no political affiliation because of it. Cares only about doling out justice and purging the wicked.\n\nThat’s what I got right now.","replies":[]}]}
