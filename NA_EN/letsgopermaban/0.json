Who are you playing vs him? So people know what to tell you. Ex: how to play out the matchup, recommended items and in what order, runes, masteries, etc. Ex: many renekton players actually start w (stun) vs him instead of q which is their normal start in most matchups. This is because while you get silenced by garen, you activate w before he hits you with q. This stuns him - allowing you to continue autoing him while he does nothing because he is stunned. Thus you win lvl 1 trades vs garen as renekton. That's one example. So if you really do want help, say what your matchup is or ask what to play vs garen and people can recommend matchups and describe what to do. Also is garen always running the same masteries or does it vary by match?
