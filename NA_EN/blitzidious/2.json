Also, you gave me somewhat of a heart attack, I didn't expect a Rioter to comment on this, let alone other people. Also, if Riot keeps making skins that remind me of Dark Souls, I may have no money remaining. I don't play Sivir or Nautilus, but I now want to.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sinslayr","date":"2015-02-23T22:21:30.283+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't know about you guys but has anyone else seen the visual bug where when you use Q or hook the end of the hook is missing?","replies":[]},{"poster":"dirtybit","date":"2015-02-17T03:23:44.089+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"RIOT when will the warden skins come out?","replies":[]}]}
