After I typed all my info in and clicked \"Signup\" or \"Create\" or whatever it says, it goes to \"Loading...\" for a couple of seconds then goes back to \"Signup\" or whatever. I used 2 different browsers and I cleared cookies. I am new to the whole boards thing so sorry if this is in the wrong area!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-21T17:43:03.020+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If I understand correctly, you're signing up for an account but nothing happens- not even an error.  This can happen for a few reasons, the biggest one being that you've selected a birth date that doesn't meet the age requirement for the game.  Beyond that, your email or username might already be in use.  Let me know if that clears things up!","replies":[{"poster":"Emoonk","date":"2017-03-21T17:51:44.870+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I made a new email for this account, still didnt work. I changed the birth date to something that I knew would work, still wouldn't work. I switched the username a bit and still wouldn't work.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-21T17:57:20.910+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Strange!  This could be some kind of block specifically with your network.  Would you be able to try signing up through a different network setup?","replies":[{"poster":"Emoonk","date":"2017-03-21T17:59:41.965+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry could you clarify?

That is likely why nothing happens when you select sign-up!","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-21T18:08:05.541+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank's for the video.  By different network, I mean using another internet provider outside of what you're currently connected to.  This could even be your phone if you have a data plan.  Regarding the birthdate adjustment, if this was the case then signup can fail after multiple attempts.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
