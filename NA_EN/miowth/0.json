While they normally would just be a small LP hit, dodges do also count as a loss in a series (though your MMR remains unaffected). Hope this helps explain what happened.   I do see you're back in series now though, so good luck on the push to Gold 1!","replies":[{"poster":"Ruukuegg","date":"2016-05-21T17:36:21.724+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You know, I have had the client freeze on me twice in promo game champ selects which lead to my dodging, I chose the champ I wanted but couldn't lock.
