Once it starts to load it loads in 1-5 seconds. My teammates are all at 100% for a long time before I actually load into the game. I have normal ping during the game (55-60). All following games connect quickly and I load at a normal pace. (Approx 15-30 seconds). My PC exceeds all requirements by quite a significant margin and only encounter this issue once per day","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-25T20:21:53.303+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It might be that the game is just taking a bit loading those files the first time. I would try checking the option \"close client during game\" in the client settings and see if that helps out with the first loads, or you could try a quick repair as well.","replies":[]}]}
