This means even though it has a 45 second cooldown, you can proc it multiple times in a team fight, which leads to a higher impact rune than electrocute. Dark harvest is very easy to proc most of the time as well, considering any damage at all will proc it, from autos to abilities to dots, including ignite. It feels cheap (at least to me) that just being slightly under 50% hp will lead to a single auto chunking me for 100-200 damage.\n\nThis ease of proc is why I don't think it is exactly comparable to old electrocute.

This time is also enough to pull back in a guaranteed loss fight in most cases. Champions who are designed to output a lot of aoe damage are in general the only ones to ever get more than 2 proc's in a teamfight. I've had multiple cases where i just didn't proc my DH because the enemy was already dead when it came back up. I usually pull around 20 stacks on the high end in a winning game by 30 minutes.\n\nThe only cases that need to be looked at are poke champions like Caitlyn/ Xerath, Big teamfight assassins like Wukong/Katarina, Brand and Karthus. Those cases are the biggest abusers of DH and some of them aren't really unhealthy. They are just utilizing a new rune efficiently.\n\nThe rune is insanely cheap which is why I feel it should have like a range cap of proc'ing or the nerf they are putting on pbe of not proc'ing off procs like ignite or scorch, but I don't want Riot to gut it into unusable like Klepto.","replies":[{"poster":"CZ0","date":"2018-11-27T17:55:10.139+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can proc it all 5 times as Master Yi getting a penta Alpha takes about 1 to 1.5 secs to finish.

The issue is with how it works. \n\nFor example, take 3 people had DH in my team and all of them proc it on the same person. That person dies and all get a DH reset. That's 3x DH reset with only a cooldown of 1.5sec. In addition, if you hit an AOE ability on more than one target, you apply multiple stacks and this obviously means AOE champs will get those stacks much quicker.\n\nThere are simple solutions to this that riot could apply. \n1) Multiple DH no longer can proc on the same target below 50%HP\n2) It only gives one stack per proc, regardless of how many targets got hit (more like how electrocute works)\n3) Last but not least, it's cooldown resets on takedown but has a minimum of 4 second CD.\n\nTo those who are worried about DH's infinite scaling, the whole purpose of DH was to be used as a scaling rune, as confirmed by riot in the patch notes. Before it had a more niche pick that only proc'd by autos but now the rune can be used by all champs. If anything, it has introduced choice, the only reason this diversity is backfiring now is because of the way it works, and as such, it is literally cancer to play against a team with multiple DH users.
