One of my friends signed up 2 weeks ago and he got into both. Is there any reason for the delay? I really want to test out the new stuff you guys have worked hard on and I have a good computer to do so. Is there gonna be a response soon? please reply :)","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-14T04:04:29.520+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The length of time you've been waiting for acceptance doesn't directly affect your chances of getting in, unfortunately. While both systems are quite different and the criteria used for selecting candidates for either are fairly different, one thing remains consistent. We look for really active players that are a positive influence on the community and would provide some great feedback.\n\nI recommend reading through both the [PBE FAQ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751904-Public-Beta-Environment-FAQ#top) and the [Alpha Client FAQ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/206201070-Alpha-Client-FAQ) for a more detailed rundown on both systems. Let me know if you have any questions.","replies":[{"poster":"Miles MoraIes","date":"2016-10-14T14:12:56.097+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"oh ok thanks i guess ill wait longer xD","replies":[]}]}]}
