The help article linked from the error message is here: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761944\r\n\r\nI ran the Hextech Repair Tool as admin, and double checked everything was in order. Ran through the list of things to try manually to make sure after it failed again, then came here only to see several other post with the same issue.\r\n\r\nHopefully its fixed soon. I use Comcast in the U.S.. if that helps for any reason :).","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-20T21:34:52.903+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There were some login issues during this period, but everything should be okay now.
