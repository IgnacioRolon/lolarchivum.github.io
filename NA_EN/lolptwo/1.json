You can add a Mystery Skin for Light Green summoners and a Mystery Summoner Icon for Dark Green Icon.\n\n3: It provides clarity for Toxic players to realize they need to stop and will also provide clarity as to whether the reports against you are valid. I see alot of people saying they get report warnings for games they never spoke in, it happens to me too. This would show post game that your toxicity level never raised and provides a VISUAL feedback for people who are so inclined to know where they are standing.\n\n4: It will promote less permabans and a generally nicer community. People will know exactly where they stand. I&#039;m sure more people will stop toxicity all together once they reach the Red Stage in fear of actually getting banned. It can also show (to couple with my other post) how hate speeches and racism,homophobia can jump you from Tier to Tier, so it shows just how serious Riot is about these occurrences in League.\n\n\n5: As someone who&#039;s been toxic and reformed, I can tell you first hand if I had something like this. I never would of made it as far as I did. The chat logs and never ending warnings that I didn&#039;t know were serious or not because I was in the heat of a two way argument was not giving me incentive to stop. However staying at that Light Green at the beginning of the season and really wanting that Mystery Gift and seeing it on a day to day basis would probably of been better in serving MY personal preference. \n\n\n\nSecond Idea: This one is a little more controversial but funny to me\n\n**To people who are Chat Restricted and Toxic, make it so they can&#039;t say toxic words. Not that it&#039;s beeped out but that it simply doesn&#039;t show in chat. **\n\nI just think it would be really funny if you saw a Chat restricted person say  ____ you Teemo , Id _______ love ________ you \n\nI find there&#039;s some words that in general just don&#039;t belong in online gaming and there no need or way that anyone would ever need to use them constructively. This includes Racist, Homophobic, Death Threat words. So why even allow people to have to read this nonsense? Make them invisible.\n\nNow I know the counter argument &quot;Freedom of Speech! Freedom of Speech!&quot; &quot;Mute button!&quot;\n\nYes I know, but I think this should only apply to Chat restricted people, where their right to talk freely has been taken away(it already is) because of their abusive nature. It would also make it so that they can&#039;t send other people on tilt because people won&#039;t have to read their sometimes hurtful words(not so much to me but i&#039;ve seen people on the forums here genuinely hurt) \n\nIt would encourage the toxic player to know, there is no fighting back against the system, you are chat restricted, anything you say that is toxic will sound like a funny mad lib and actually promote laughter and positivity to your team.\n\n\nThank you so much if you read it all.

Let's say that I get punished when the meter hits 10. I do a little testing and discover that I gain 0.1 - 0.2 if I'm especially toxic during a match. I also figure out that a week's worth of not being reported causes me to drop 0.5. Now I know exactly what I need to do to never be punished and punishments become useless\n\nGiven an opportunity, people will game the system.","replies":[{"poster":"lolptwo","date":"2015-12-26T19:37:34.295+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"This is exactly what I was initially thinking. You bring up a really good point. This is why I think more harsh hate speeches can immediately jump people from one level to the other. I think overall you will have to be minutely toxic to be able to game the system .5%'s at a time. Which already exists in League on a game to game basis. \n\nRiot suggests that they have harsher and immediate escalation in penalties for hate speeches. It would be even more beneficial to show that person. \"Oh man I was really toxic that game, I went up half a bar! I need to stop\"\n\nOverall. That is the biggest issue with this concept. I still believe that non-toxic people wouldn't attempt to game the system due to their nature of not being toxic, and toxic people might look to reform more than they already are. \n\nIn addition I would imagine Riot has a similar system in place right now, but is just rather invisible to us, and people are still learning to abuse that system. \n\nTLDR; Riot's system already has a similar implemented system, I believe the clarity would be more beneficial rather than the current state of unknown(everyone knows you go down a tier of punishment after 3 months of playing on a smurf or etc. doesn't mean you have reformed)","replies":[{"poster":"Ulanopo","date":"2015-12-26T20:40:43.274+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You don't want people thinking they have **any** leeway.

They respond solely because the punishment shows them that Riot is serious.

If a parent says \"hey do this or else\" and you never do it and no consequences come you won't ever do it when asked again.

I'm sure you have more info than I do, or maybe I'm seeing more outbursts than usual, I agree on one thing though. There is less taunting about the system now than during the punishment volcano period. Simply from my perspective though. Mind you, I play a lot of games.\n\n\nI always tend to forgot that Riot has a lot of people putting fourth ideas all the time.\n\nMaybe this idea isn't the best given that when system's get abused they get abused hard.\n\nThough after every game that I get a toxic player I do find myself asking \"is there really any way to fix this?\"\n\nThanks for the feedback. Good to have a logical constructive point of view.\n\nOne last question:  I wonder if Riot will of seen a massive increase in permabans since the implementation of their new system, I know for a fact I've seen a lot more on the boards lately...what does this tell us about our previously conceived ideas about the current state of the \"toxicity\" in the games? Is it really as low as we think it is?(1-2%) or is it much larger than we expected(taking into consideration smurfs dont get played on as much as mains, bot accounts, double -triple account owners) since the new system clamps down better than the old.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"DeynaTaggerung","date":"2015-12-26T01:42:18.153+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"xD the mad lib idea sounds pretty hilarious.\n\nI don't know about the viability of your toxicity meter but it's an interesting idea so I'll bump for visiblity","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nin10do0014","date":"2015-12-26T05:22:17.645+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I strongly support the toxicity meter.

And in order for it to work, you scale every comparative trait up. And the comparison is not to all players, but SPECIFIC players. Players who don't treat other players like dirt by default don't need a cookie. They grew up at some point. So the only people we're talking about are the ones who have trouble acting decently in the first place. And if they cease that activity, then yes, they're REFORMED players. Ergo, Ex-Con is an appropriate analogy, provided everything else is scaled accordingly (offense, reward, penalty, etc.) Hence, $100 for not robbing a store... yet you fault me for scaling up the offense while someone else replies to you saying \"it's even worse, he scaled up the reward\". The lack of understanding here is astounding. You probably already realized all this, but I'll give you the benefit of the doubt that you are sincerely missing the point.\n\n> There is no way you can be an Ex-Con and still be in the Light Green section...\n\nUm... I didn't realize you had a meter color for \"so outrageous, is probably an ex-con\".

Here's how you get \"rewarded\" for behavior: No one fires you.\n\n> The idea is to make it harder for people to break it.\n\nCensoring with asterisks vs underscores vs spaces does not make anything harder to break.\n\nThat's the last I'll say in this thread.
