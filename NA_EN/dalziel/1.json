FPS isn't consistently locking to refresh rate, all Nvidia control panel settings are correct and match with in-game settings, so I don't think it's V-sync but its exhibiting symptoms that a faulty V-sync would mirror. \n\nNot an expert, just something i've noticed, hope it gets patched or something soon, it's extremely difficult to play in this environment.","replies":[]},{"poster":"FireWolfYT","date":"2018-06-14T23:30:13.631+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same problem here.
