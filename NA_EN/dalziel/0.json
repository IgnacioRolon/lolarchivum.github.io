If he resonates with a player, they put in the time to master him, and learn him. He is a raged hyper carry with.a huge skill ceiling, and the challenge, that every game you can always improve, is one of the best parts of him. He is incredibly fun, the only champion I can never be bored with no matter how much I play him, and every game feels rewarding. If you change him, it would take a scalpel honed to a incredibly sharp edge to keep his hard to master hypercarry shuffling identity intact. Don't take out what makes him a complex and fun champion. \n\nAlso, with respect, the most recent Azir nerf, the one that appears to have driven more casual Azir players to the current meta midlands, may not have been necessary. After the second to most recent change, the mets was shifting significantly as a whole, and as it settled he may have not needed it. To be fair I hardly even noticed it, don't even remember what it was, but for players with less experience, they either switched to the current OP, or just went back to their comfort champ. He may have been fine. I wold love to descuss basically any aspect of his kit and any change you are considering. If you do end up deciding to change him, please make some sort of discussion so players like me, and anyone who knows him, can at least try to contribute and make a case for/against something. Sorry for the text wall but this is something I feel very strongly about. Il attach my classroom doodle of the emperor in all his pencil drawn glory if you promise not to kill him :D\n\nLong live the emperor, don't kill him and make Sivir do the work reviving him again.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BloodyTompon","date":"2016-09-19T23:52:24.164+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can't you hit temporal aspects of his kit (inc. speed) to hit the high end more than the low end?
