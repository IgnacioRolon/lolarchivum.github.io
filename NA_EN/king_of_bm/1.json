I play league of legends on a potato with potato mode enabled, but after every game I've to wait approx 3 minutes for the client to save/download replay and in that time I legit can't do anything. Everything turns slow and I'm not interested in having .rofl replays or any replays because I play on 8fps and recording videos always end up really slow.\r\npls\r\nsend\r\nhalp\r\nasap","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-09T02:48:38.801+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Let's check to see if you have an option turned on that actually makes the after match lobby load slower unintentionally, an option called \"Close Client during Game\" in the client settings. If that option is checked, go ahead and turn it off and then let me know if that after match lobby loads faster for you!","replies":[{"poster":"King of BM","date":"2017-05-09T04:55:39.262+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, that definitely is a solution and I'll do it. The reason I kept it turned on was to save my fps but there really hasn't been that much of a difference as the new client takes less memory than the old one which had LoL Patcher and one other process running even when it wasn't patching. But I'd still like to disable the recording if it hoards a bit of fps and if it doesn't then it's fine.\n\nAlso while I'm already writing here let me just inform you of some bugs that I know\n\n1. In rune page setup, it'll show tier 1 and tier 2 even when they aren't checked, so you have to uncheck and recheck again everytime you decide to change runes :screenshot - https://ibb.co/cRMtqk\n2. (People who really run a super slow PC) If somebody dodges the champion select and the ready check comes instantly, there is a 90% chance you will not see the readycheck and it'll send an alert that you have declined the readycheck ALONG WITH \"There was an unexpected problem while displaying readycheck\" and something. So obviously you'll have to wait 20 more minutes if you are on leaver queue and it doesn't display the readycheck and just declines it for you. \n3. Changing club tags while in a room will sometimes NOT show the change ANYWHERE (in room or in champion select) except chatbox.\n4. Right side chatbox is broken and will sometimes show wrong indicator (blue color) even when the person is not in-game/queue or creating a room (if creating a room is not intended to be blue color then that probably is broken too)\n5. If somebody has been afk for sometime (lets say 8 minutes) and the game has been going for 10 minutes, on the right sidebar it'll say in-game for 2 minutes. Not sure if this is a bug but whatever.\n\n\nSide Note - I had 13900ip and I sneezed while trying to change my name to something, so I changed it to \"I sneeze\" it was almost worth it but I think I might have to relog on boards to see the change right? Because I clearly am I sneeze right now but it says posting as Mid Lane Lux","replies":[{"poster":"Valdere","date":"2017-12-31T21:55:45.205+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> (People who really run a super slow PC) If somebody dodges the champion select and the ready check comes instantly, there is a 90% chance you will not see the readycheck and it'll send an alert that you have declined the readycheck ALONG WITH \"There was an unexpected problem while displaying readycheck\" and something.
