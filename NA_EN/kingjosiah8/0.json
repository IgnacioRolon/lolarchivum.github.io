The map is equally as hard as Summoners Rift but whenever I get an S or S+ it doesn&#039;t give me the token. If there isn&#039;t any reason why it shouldn&#039;t be added, I would like it to be added into the game as I know a lot of people (including myself) who play Twisted more than Summoners. It would be a great convenience to us as we have to go over to Summoners to earn our tokens. \r\n\r\n_Sincerley\r\nKingjosiah8    {{champion:6}} _","replies":[]}
