I know this is probably due to bandwidth/number of people on the internet, but I still don't understand why I move like it's 300+ ping when it says 40, then it constantly disconnects and reconnects me. I have been going into bot games to check ping, moving around and fighting to make sure its okay, then doing a real one so I didn't just hop in a match and feed, but the game has been crashing while loading into pvp matches, when it didn't for custom matches. I've mostly been playing co-op ai the last day or two, and really don't mind just trying to play when the internet it working well, but I got a leaver buster for lagging and attempting to RC from my co-op AI games. Was excited for college because I thought I'd get to play league all the time, but I got cucked. Really just want to know why my ping lies to me. So thanks for the help.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-30T23:35:13.909+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you're having packet loss, which can be caused by a poor connection.  I'd suggest starting with going over the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to rule out any possibilities of local connection problems.  You should also reach out to your campus IT to see if they can help as well, which they're usually pretty good about.  Hope that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"Dilløn","date":"2016-12-01T06:08:58.814+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks!

Here they keep our NAT type on Strict which means a lot of ports are closed which restricts internet and increases security. This decreases gaming experience and there are some games that are just unplayable (like Steep). If you are lucky, your IT services may open some ports for you and make your NAT type Moderate or even Open, however, if your college is like mine they won't help you.\n\nYou should only experience minor packet loss in League of Legends when there are lots of people on the internet watching netflix and stuff though so I wouldn't worry about it.. but games like Call of Duty you will experience much more disconnecting problems :(","replies":[]}]}
