Please check logs for more information (At 33%)\n\nI have a wired connection and my connection is very good so I don't think it's my connection\n\nWhat I have tried to fix it:\n- Uninstalling and Reinstalling LoL\n- Repair button\n- Manual repair\n- Restart Computer\n- Restart Patcher\n- Click the Retry Button (On the Unspecified Error pop-up)\n- Letting it run (Gets to 99% with 0 Files Scanned on step 2/2 (I have let it run for 2 days in a row with no progress whatsoever))\n- Running as an admin\n\nI have gotten Unspecified Errors at 33%, 34%, 43%, 70%, 72% and 99%\n\nI don't know if it's because I have it on a separate hard drive (With like 3 terabytes on it) and not on my Local Disc but when I had it on my local disc I didn't have enough space :P\n\nI have tried everything that I can and I don't know what to do. I just want to play my League! :(\n\nI tried again with someone saying they renamed their lol_game_client folder to lol_game_client. I got to 70% with 1 file scanned and got an Unspecified Error pop-up\n\nLater, I  noticed that Windows had an update so I updated it. After that I uninstalled and reinstalled LoL. Got to 72% and got an Unspecified Error p-p. Nothing seems to be working.\n\nPlease help p-p\n\nI'm dying inside p-p...","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-11T21:57:39.882+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Failures after 32% during the patching process are usually caused by your patcher disconnecting from the patching servers.
