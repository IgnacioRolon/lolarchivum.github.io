From what ive noticed kled has the most unique voice over yet due to fact that he one of the only champs that actually swears like i was whatching a streamer called pawnce tuned in at the right moment and noticed kled saying &quot;Where the F***k are we&quot; after the PBE lagged it was as if he broke the fourth wall along with multiple other swears and i was just wonder why is kled the only champ so far that swears? Was it to fit the whole rural war veteran type feel or what cause it realy has me interested more into the making of this champion.","replies":[{"poster":"WAAARGHbobo","date":"2016-07-29T17:29:03.441+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"The short answer is, i strongly felt it matched his character.   Kled is highly emotional, crude and proud of it!   It added to understanding him, how he plays, and was funny.   That same language wouldnt really work with Jhin, Tahm, or even Dunkmaster D.","replies":[{"poster":"rtbf210310095","date":"2016-07-29T17:51:42.510+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"So kled can swear, but graves can only vape?{{sticker:zombie-nunu-tears}}","replies":[{"poster":"Oleandervine","date":"2016-07-29T18:01:01.863+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=dirtyjob13,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=Uit24ZbH,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2016-07-29T17:51:42.510+0000)\n>\n> So kled can swear, but graves can only vape?{{sticker:zombie-nunu-tears}}\n\nKled's swearing is localized to NA, where no one really cares.

Plus alot of his VO won't make it over to in game anyway. But yeah the VO's are designed to create the idea of crazed old war veteran. I love them as much as most fans of Kled but the old \"if X can have Y, why can't Graves have his cigar?\" meme is really over used.","replies":[]}]}
