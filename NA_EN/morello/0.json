I won't recap the whole discussion as it's long, but our goals are;\n\n1) Ensure Skarner's pattern is healthy, can be balanced, and allows for meaningful choices when fighting against him\n\n2) Create (or somehow restore) Skarner's identity that players miss now - mainly that of the \"inevitable predator\", freight-train style play.\n\n3) Make sure Skarner's strengths and weaknesses make sense.\n\nWith that, I wanted to shop two different ideas to players and get a read on which direction seems like the better set of tradeoffs to satisfy these goals. To be clear, this must be a tradeoff to meet goals 1) and 3), but which one we choose is heavily influenced by 2).\n\nIn both versions, his old passive would be removed, **but the passive would be a passive on the Q (so it stays the same)** Listed below.\nOther skill cooldowns likely lowered to match the fact that they don't get the passive. This keeps him out of total feast-or-famine, but allows some scaling/changes in power based on performance. In both versions:\n\n**Q**: Skarner gains A/B/C% movement speed as he stacks up Q hits, for X seconds. This will help him stick when he reaches a target.\n\nNow, for the two passive directions we're looking at.\n\n**Direction 1:** Skarner is a premier freight-train with great stickiness and good control. His tradeoff is his damage pattern is less bursty/longer time-to-kill, \n\nNew Passive: **Crystal Poison (name tbd)** Spells apply stacks of poison to the enemy. After X stacks, the next auto-attack will do a (short) stun and bonus damage.\n\n1) We're stoked on this because it adds into his training pattern\n2) We have a cool animation and effect we can repurpose to make this awesome (stings you with his tail!) \n3) Likely more healthy with his natural transition into late-game initiator\n\n**Direction 2:** Skarner is a damage-oriented fighter with low utility. Gets no more control than on live, and does damage until transitioning into a late-game pick-tank.\n\nNew passive: After X spell hits, Skarner's next attack does +damage and heals him for Y. \n\n1) Likely true damage\n2) The more he trains, the more damage he does\n3) Probably gets really bad if behind because damage is more granular and dependent on snowballing.\n\nSo this is what we're talking about right now. I wanted to come ask what you think about these - I have my opinion, but since we want to make this right, we wonder if damage, or the ability to train/control is MORE important to Skarner fans or potential Skarner fans.","replies":[{"poster":"lightdragoon88","date":"2014-04-26T04:01:01.152+0000","up_votes":39,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{champion:112}} **\"Let me know when you are done working on Skarner.

The second choice would work a lot better if he was a laning champion, giving him sustain he needs to stay in lane, but doesn't do a lot in teamfights, as he won't be able proc the heal when his ult is active. Love the Q buff though, but if the old passive is getting moved to Q, the ult CD would have to be almost cut in half to be in par with ww ult. One thing about the first passive is that Braums will be a lot more useful as teammates will be able to stun the target as well, so it should be a lot stronger than Braums or it will fall shy of greatness.\n\nI like it, miss the old passive, but happy to see changes (although i hope the cd for abilities are worth the switch)","replies":[{"poster":"Phoenix Kotori ","date":"2014-04-25T23:21:36.082+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":2,"body":"As someone who loves skarner and played him since S2, I really agree with this post.

This is a copy paste from a post I made soon after the rework btw.\n\n\nWhy didn't his Q receive the proper QOL changes for removing the slow on it? Right now unless you're standing right on top of them enemies can just walk out of the Q because of its slow animation and low range. Hecarim's Q in comparison deals damage instantaneously around him and has the same range. So perhaps it would be a good idea to increase it's range by maybe 100 units.\n\nNot only that but why does it still have a weak first cast if the slow is gone? Design wise that was the whole reason it couldn't be full power from the start and it still having one seems unnecessary.\n\nFinally why can't he hold his Q stacks longer? Keeping them up without the permaslow is quite harder not to mention since it now has the AS speed steroid it hurts his clearing a little, because you can't really go from one camp to another without setting yourself up for it. Again the reason he couldn't hold it long was to add counterplay due to the permaslow, with that gone he should be able to hold them much longer.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Karede","date":"2014-04-26T03:04:56.855+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> This is right. We are planning on base Cooldown reductions for w e and r to make up for the loss of passive.\n\nCurrently his passive makes his Ult and incredible tool.  With blue buff and a jungle to clear, I can gank with an ult, clear the jungle quickly, and basically be ready to go with the ult again.  I can easily get 40~ auto attacks before the cooldown is ready.  I would **always** have it ready after a full jungle clear.  The change in his ult cooldown should be significant.\n\nThe change to W and E are trickier.  Currently, we have to pick if we are going to use the shield to engage or during the gank - we cannot use it twice a fight until longer fights.  The E is also a one trick pony.

To us it's more important that Skarner players like the overall direction that he's going, and we'll tweak stuff like clear speeds afterwards.\n\nSkarner has always had stellar clear times in the jungle.  Currently he could be **the** fastest clear time in the jungle early.  This is an outstanding characteristic for him to have, and if he loses this it will create many new problems for him to face.\n\nOther tanky, cc oriented jungles have gap closing abilities or multiple interrupt/knockups/snares to make up for their lower damage output.(Amumu, Maokai, Sejuani)\n\nEspecially since he will not have a true gap-closer and must remain in melee range to do his work, his ability to level up quickly in the jungle and get to ganking at at least an equivolant level to the lane he is ganking is imperative.  Skarner is not a bully in the jungle currently and gets pushed out quickly by many of the popular picks at the moment. Lowering his damage will exacerbate this weakness.\n\nWhat if, instead of lowering the base damage on his Q, you lowered it's scaling?  That way Skarner could still clear quickly (especially early), do pretty solid damage early game with his ganks (a problem early because of stickiness, which you are now addressing), and then he wouldn't snowball out of control into the late game. (He would still find great value in building tanky.)  Remember, he currently has little to no burst damage.\n\nWe would still find value in building Triforce\\Iceborn because they are based on auto attack damage, but the Q wouldn't make him carry like a real carry. \n\nTo sum up quickly - taking away damage on Skarner seems extremely scary to me.  He does not do great early damage before scaling and items, but his jungle on the multi-creep camps helps him get ahead stat-wise (level-wise) as long as he isn't shoved out of the jungle.  This enables him to take a beating which offsets the necessity to be in melee range.  Take away scaling, but please do not take away jungle clear speed.  This is his one true strength right now.\n\nI know that you mentioned that clear times are easier to tweak.  Moving forward, I feel that it's **very** important to not create new gigantic problems for a champ with a whole list of them already.  Slowing his jungle clear would be a very, **very** big problem for this champion to deal with, and the replacement of power would need to be gigantic to offset this.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Maelstrom51","date":"2014-04-26T13:28:19.508+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"This response really worries me.\n\nKilling Skarner's damage does not bring back how the old Skarner felt, it merely pushes him to the other end of the \"not Skarner\" spectrum.\n\nThe old Skarner was both a sticky champion and a strong duelist.

My concern is that following the D1 and taking away some of his damage in order to add more CC to his kit, you guys will ended up turning him into a new {{champion:113}}  or {{champion:57}} . These champs have a good amount of CC and are able to tank a lot of damage middle to late game, but they rely on their team following them because they have like no damage. You guys know better than me that the tank junglers are very unappreciated right now and totally out of the meta. If he becomes a utility tank with very little damage (and horrible clear times) he will be still out of the meta and probably won't be picked. \n\nUsing {{champion:113}} as example again, she has a lot of CC and her kit is actually fun to use, but her clear times are so bad and the fact that she can't fight anyone make it very hard to choose her over any other jungler even with all her CC.

I think Amumu or Maokai are these types...it's unlikely we'd buff them to compete, as we'd have to make them good duelists to do that.\n\n2) I don't think we're looking to full-tank Skarner in Direction 1. We are looking to give him more CC and stickiness, but his time to kill might be a bit slower. This is how you allow someone to interact and respond when running isn't an option. If you can't fight, and you can't run, then there's not a lot the character can add to the game other than \"he's overpowered\" or \"he's weak.\" The additional time for him to kill allows collapses and team-oriented moves to help, as Skarner isn't going to be great at getting away.\n\nRemember the CC also has + damage on it, it's just more back-loaded - it turns on a little slower overall in a fight.

Also you can't autoattack during your ult, meaning you can't proc your passive... with new passive 1 it might be alright, you don't wannna stack stuns (unless it increased your ult's active time...) but with new passive 2 it seems only logical to heal when the enemy is supressed, not after.\n\nI trust in that you'll find a good spot for Skarner though and turning him into a poison champ would be interesting as well, what I'm saying is just don't scrap your advance on him up until today, please!","replies":[{"poster":"Locke64","date":"2014-04-30T03:55:33.444+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"That reminds me, can we roll back the buff to E's slow?

I'm worried that shifting too much of his power into his CC will kill his dueling potential.  He's always felt like a hybrid damage fighter with very high CDR scaling, but removing his damage will just shift him into more of a tank role than he already is.  I guess a lot of it comes down to the numbers, and I'm sure either could be balanced to make him feel good.  If Direction 1 can be done while keeping his identity as a strong fighter, then I'm all for it.","replies":[{"poster":"Maelstrom51","date":"2014-04-26T13:36:55.757+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":2,"body":"I am an avid (old) Skarner player and I agree.\n\nAdding more CC and gutting his damage does not make him feel like Skarner again, it just pushes him to the other end of the \"not Skarner\" spectrum.\n\nSkarner was both sticky and a duelist.

Less damage means longer fights, which means more mana spent.\n\nRight this moment, if you give rework Skarner a couple of items and put him in a duel against a manaless bruiser (also with a couple of items) he will lose in a prolonged fight because he is unable to burn them down before he runs out of mana.  It feels like a damage nerf with current mana costs is just going to make this situation worse.\n\nPlease consider adding mana and/or health sustain to the stun (like Kennen's passive)","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Al3xn","date":"2014-04-26T01:17:43.370+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":1,"body":"I know I'm in the minority but I've recently started to play Skarner top and have found him pretty fun to play. Personally if I wanted to be selfish I would choose the 2nd option as I feel like it would fit my own playstyle with him more and is a much better passive that would work well for him in the top lane as it would provide the sustain which I feel like is his main issue top.\n\nHowever if I were choosing to restore his 'identity' I would definitely choose the 1st option. My only concern with choosing that would be that the reduced damage on his Q would gut his ability to be played in the top lane, I guess it would be dependent on the passive bonus damage. \n\nSo my main question really is what is your opinion on Skarner top, and are you considering it when balancing Skarner? And what impact do you think \neach of the two options would have on top lane Skarner?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Guitar Solo","date":"2014-04-26T00:04:00.889+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":4,"body":"I like the direction of poison, but the thought of a stun over a stacking thresh level slow seems weird\n\nI'm on board for a utility skarner over a fighter.

The movement speed boost sounds like it brings his stickness up Anyway. Iceborn Gauntlet is practically core on Skarner now so the permaslow effect is kinda there anyway. **But His Heal only has a chance to come back in direction 2.** I like the idea of Skarner as a tank as much as anyone but I feel like a short little stun wouldn't really cut it. Like if its like .5 stun then Direction 1 defintely sounds worse.\n\nAS someone who actually used Skarners whole kit on the old character bringing back some of the sustain on Skarner as well as the stickness sounds way more satisfying. I liked to play Skarner as a laner and a jungler and I feel like Direction 2 is much better for helping him achieve this. I have always felt that Skarner was a Scrappy brawler that dives in picks off an important target and ensures their demise in teamfighting scenarios.\n\n\nA Tiny amount of extra CC might make him better as a Peeler But I feel like direction 2 HELPS Skarner more through every part of the game with all the playstyles old Skarner could perform the Combined sustain and damage making him a greater threat and more difficult to kill. Anyway thats my opinion. I don't want to see some tiny lackluster CC when I could see meanful damage trades and sustain as an option on the table.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Admiral Penguin","date":"2014-04-26T03:39:37.233+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":3,"body":"I think the problem with Skarner right now isn't so much his passive (although seeing it replaced with one of these is totally fine), but that he doesn't really have an identity and that his kit is essentially the same as Udyr, but crappier.\n\nPassive number 1 is an alright and interesting passive, but it also just isn't as effective as other single-target stuns in the game. To go back to the Udyr comparison, Bear stance does Skarner's W and passive 1 at the same time with no ramp up period.\n\nTo continue with this theoretical \"passive 1\" kit, moving the cdr to his Q AND having it give MS along with AS brings with it a whole slew of problems. We end up with **one ability** that does 3 things all at the same time. That sounds like a nightmare to keep balanced AND feel good to use at the same time. \n\nYou also plan to lower Q's damage when doing that, which is seriously going to hurt his clear time, especially if passive 1 doesn't do damage. Already his clear time isn't really all that great AND it's mana hungry. \n\nPassive 2 is an alright direction too. Giving him more damage moves him more into the damage-fighter spectrum, which I find to be an area of skarner that is pretty effective. Skarner right now supposedly does more damage than he used to, but we all really know that isn't the case. Losing his ability to stick to a target really lowered his ability to maintain sustained dps compared to what he used to do, which actually inadvertently lowered his damage without actually reducing any numbers.\n\nAnyways, Passive 2 would help alleviate this problem and award Skarner for managing to stick to a target long enough to build up the stacks for a burst of damage, acting as a sort of finisher. Heck, in drawn out fights it would even heal him to allow him to keep fighting, synergizing well with his shield.\n\n\nOverall I think the real problem with Skarner is the fact that counter play against him is extremely binary. The main counterplay is evade him long enough to destroy the shield and then just kite him forever. The ramp up period on the speed boost from W only further emphasizes this, especially since you're using half of your shield duration just trying to get the maximum speed boost and reach your target.\n\nAn idea I have for alleviating this is to just make the shield last longer with a smaller speed boost. Instead of 16-32% I'm thinking like 12-20%, but the shield lasts 8-10 seconds instead, sort of like Nautilus. Also the MS boost doesn't ramp up. This makes the ability more consistent and addresses the problem of Skarner just barreling out of the fog of war like a freight train with little reaction time from the opponent. Granted, the counterplay to this is still just as binary, but overall it feels better for the Skarner player.\n\nTo sum up, both of these passives seem pretty  cool, but neither really address the main problem here with Skarner: his identity. The stun passive causes him to lose out on a lot of other things that are core to what Skarner is/was and don't really help him stand out from other fighters that do the same thing as him, namely Udyr. Passive 2 is a good direction for pushing him more into the damage end. Heck, he already has a strong multi-target slow and a Suppression drag attack. Overall though counterplay against him is pretty binary and he doesn't seem to bring anything, outside of his ultimate, to the table. The areas you should be looking at are giving him a kit that better meets the fantasy Skarner players want and I changing the passive + giving Q a MS buff aren't really going to solve that dilemma. Plus 3 effects on Q is just silly.","replies":[]}]}
