I can't do anything but is there any case that it was this update that came out suddenly? Do I have to wait for the next patch before I can play at all? I want to understand why it is suddenly happening.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-27T22:49:10.446+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like your patcher is attempting to scan files, but a setting or permisisons problem is blocking it.
