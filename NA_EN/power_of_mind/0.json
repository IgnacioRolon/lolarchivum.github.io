I went into a game as renekton (the game that doesn't show what i got for a grade), we got smashed early but managed to turn it around few the enemy team making a bunch of mistakes and we were able to turn the game into a win. Once the game ended the loading stats screen would not load, after 5 minutes I skipped waiting for stats, went to my profile to see what i gained for LP, and did not get any. I waited a day to see if it was a bug/not going through, played a game just now where My team dominated early but were monkeys late, we lost. i lost 15 lp, down to 10 lp. Why did I not get LP for the renekton game? I did not afk, I never dc'd at all. I had perfect connection and 40 ping all game. It is really disheartening to know that not only is leagues ranked system mostly about luck, but now i have to climb vs the system as well not giving me LP on games I won.\n\nEdit*** I was 0lp silver 5 on the ahri game, which I won and gained 25 lp. I should be 25 lp higher than I currently am. I am pretty tilted about this.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-22T18:59:47.471+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey I looked into this for you, and it does look like our server was able to pick up the match but it didn't save in the ranking ladder.  I'm not exactly sure why that happened, but I did notice the match was around the time of the ghost issues yesterday.  That sucks a lot, I'm sorry it didn't save.  :(  \n\nAs much as we wish we could, we literally don't have an ability to restore LP or modify ranked stats at all.  Doing so would literally and likely crash the entire ladder system.  I've forwarded your report over to interested parties to investigate potential issues, though I'm sorry I couldn't be of better help here.

Ugh that just really blows and hope it doesn't happen again.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-26T15:13:08.294+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nope.  :(  Player support doesn't have access to modifying ranked stats, not kidding when I say that any small adjustment could break the system.  It does blow, but you can do this! Stay confident!","replies":[]}]}]}]}
