It takes a long time to install and it won't let me save progress. My downloads go from 3000KBps to 500. I am about to give up. This seems absurd that I can't do this in increments. Can't I not cap process usage or is there a way to download in steps","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-31T02:41:04.974+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately, our client doesn't have a way to pause the download currently. I've run into this exact problem myself a few times with other games, and the best solution I've found is to let the download start at night when the internet traffic isn't quite as high, and that way your network won't be using bandwidth for any other activities. That should give it plenty of uninterrupted time to fully download.","replies":[{"poster":"puppetmasteria","date":"2017-08-01T01:22:28.307+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ok thank you for your response","replies":[]}]}]}
