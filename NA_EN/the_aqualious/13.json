And I can see why he isn&#039;t played often\r\n\r\nHis Passive is Lissandra&#039;s only instead of a Timer it&#039;s after 5 auto&#039;s... It&#039;s not a bad passive, but there could be something better to fit him\r\n\r\nHis Q, yeah it buffs him, but you can&#039;t use it on Champs which is a tad annoying... Even if they changed the damage output so that it does the True damage to minions and some other amount of damage to champs would be nice \r\n\r\nHis W is similar to WW&#039;s plus a movement speed buff, but it kinda feels odd in his kit, like it was tagged on\r\n\r\nHis E, I personally felt it could use with a bit more range, and a bit more damage... But that&#039;s just me\r\n\r\nHis Ult... Really the only thing I can say the guy has going for him...\r\n\r\nSum it up... In the Jungle... He can take Objectives well and Farm the Jungle with Ease... But that&#039;s really it... Ganking feels a bit lack lustre on him since he really does need to rely on his teammate to make something happen with a slowed enemy and speed up movement, plus a Yeti punching the guy in the face...\r\n\r\nHis Kit mainly seems to be one that could be used to build him into a Support, with all the movement Buffs and Debuffs... But his win rate as support is abysmal \r\n\r\nAnd you can only build him one way... A tank... There&#039;s AP scalings on him... But he can&#039;t damage champs with his Q, and his Ult has to cool down meaning he really only has access to his E to provide that extra punch\r\n\r\nAll in All... I think that Nunu needs a rework because he doesn&#039;t really have a lane or role that he can really latch onto... His kit is all over the place needing focus... and playing him doesn&#039;t feel fun or exciting or something else\r\n\r\nAnd people can say that I&#039;m wrong and I&#039;m an idiot, and I could be, since I haven&#039;t played him much at all, but this is how I felt while and after playing him...\r\n\r\nJust my Thoughts","replies":[{"poster":"Myrddin","date":"2016-08-21T06:20:38.120+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"I suppose he could use a rework\n\nWhen he's good he's oppressive when he's anything less... not really useful","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nami in Bush","date":"2016-08-21T07:52:37.959+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"He's a slow-bot.

Everything is drop-n'-forget. This is good, because it's 2016 and there are still people who do not follow up Braum passives, which would suggest that maybe champions like Nunu or Ashe who have a button or two aren't bad ideas.\n\nIf Nunu needs a change, it needs to be to his resources and power budget, not to his identity or kit. His passive is at length the most removed part of his kit; everything else feels kind of nice and makes Nunu nice to have around.\n\nOf course, if they do change him, he'll have no buffs and, as was said, %max HP every 3rd. Plus a slow on that, probably?

In preseason 3 (I think....it was whenever he got his latest Q) he was an absolute nightmare and could take every single camp from the enemy jungler with little resistance. He simply can't be solved with number changes because he is a walking stat checker where you either outdps snowballs or he buffs his ADC and nerfs yours to the ground with his ultimate/permanent slow E.\n\nThere have been a few threads with fan rework that look good, but he honestly can't be balanced with his current kit since the only way he has ever functioned as a champion is by making the enemy jungler as useless as you are and basically having a 4v4 where Nunu has SOME utility.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Oleandervine","date":"2016-08-21T14:11:25.871+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think he is on their list, but he's not at the top currently.\nAccording to Reav3 and Meddler the top 3 most requested VGUs, and their current priority queue are, in order of most requests, are Evelynn, Urgot, and Galio.\nAfter those 3, I believe they said Pantheon, Skarner and Nunu were also pretty high up, and there was recent discussion about Skarner being a strong candidate after the top 3.

A second smite on a short CD with a built in heal to boot would make pretty much any champion, no matter how badly designed otherwise, a decent jungler. However, the presence of a short-CD secondary smite (that also grants buffs on use, some of them really powerful) in his kit (IMO) takes way too much out of his power budget. Making him great at objective control, but rather terrible at much else.\n\nI think that's why he has a crappy winrate for his support role.
