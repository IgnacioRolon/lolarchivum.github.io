Dont be a hypocrite.\n\nGaren: \n\nHe is easily kited and basically a trash champ. This will let him not be utterly useless in teamfights by allowing him to actually reach a target.\n\nKai'Sa:\n\nAre you really crying about nerfs? I know bad players typically dont understand the importance of mobility or vision, but this greatly reduces her ability to assassinate and disengage.\n\nLeona:\n\nYep, things get nerfed and buffed depending on how well they do. Would you rather have them not change things at all? Wait, you cry about that too..\n\nRammus:\n\nJust under 50% winrate, a little extra armor (and damage as a result) seems just fine. First you cry about overbuffing weak champs, then you cry about underbuffing weak champs..\n\nZiggs: \n\nHis E cant even clear one wave until very late game, and it is never going to clear two unless they are stacked plus 600 AP. 40 damage lategame wont make any difference to clear.\n\nMundo:\n\nHe has a 47-48% winrate. Which is horrible. GW is much more accessible now, even with this buff he still heals less than he typically would a few seasons ago.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ZackTheWaffleMan","date":"2018-04-25T15:38:26.816+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"HAHAAHAHAHAHAAHHAHHWAjdshgiakjsHlveroiuhqpfiLaHKLJAGJOLEOU893R2Y0HPFHNCPFU;R3OIHG39[RVN\n\nYeah, I lost some brain cells trying to read this post.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jamaree","date":"2018-04-24T23:02:36.858+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"So buffing champions that need help in the current meta...what is the problem?","replies":[{"poster":"Somebody Love Me","date":"2018-04-25T15:30:08.472+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The problem is that these buffs aren't buffing the right thing.

Her passive needs to be addressed.\n\nGaren's tenacity buffs are fine, the damage, not so much.\n\nMundo's regen buffs are not where they should go. At least not to this degree. Maybe give him a bit more R regen, then give him some base ms or something. Maybe some cautious base stat buffs. What they have now is ridiculous\n\nI'm against damage buffs for tanks supports, since they already do so much with aftershock. Leo probably didn't even need buffs, but if she was gonna get anything, maybe lower her W cd, instead of upping the damage they nerfed for being problematic before.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"C9 Squeeky ","date":"2018-04-24T22:38:56.621+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Balance team is not the Champ UP team.
