The game shouldn't bend over backwards to accommodate garbage like them. Even Urgot, Darius, and Illaoi probably have some deep-rooted design flaws that limit their viability in top lane.\n\nYou want to play some fighters top lane?\n\n{{champion:164}} {{champion:39}} {{champion:2}} {{champion:240}} {{champion:24}} {{champion:266}} {{champion:23}} \n\nHere you go. Here are some fighters that have at minimum solid performance top lane in diamond+. Camille in particular is a contender for the best top laner right now.\n\nFighters aren't bad top. Just because your main might be doesn't mean the class as a whole is. And as I said, shitty trash like Garen will never be good top with his current kit if he's not hilariously overtuned. His kit is fundamentally garbage. The rework didn't fix any of his problems and added a few more.","replies":[{"poster":"TEA Nietzsche ","date":"2018-04-20T12:06:15.586+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Here you go.
