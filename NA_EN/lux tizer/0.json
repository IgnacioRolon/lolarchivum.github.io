Why is there never any action taken when Champions get to this point?\r\n\r\nImo these champions should either be temporarily disabled or flagged for immediate changes in the next patch. They just tend to be too gane-ruining and remove the entire point of the ban phase.","replies":[{"poster":"ZephyrDrake","date":"2020-01-21T05:33:04.668+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":4,"body":"Over 100% banrate?

Both teams can ban him, and remakes count towards bans while not affecting games played or win/pick rate.\n\nRight now Aphelios has over 110% pick/ban in euw challenger according to more basic statistics sites. \n\nAs far as not being close to 80%, yeah aphelios is masters+ globally.\n\n\nIf I remember correctly, most sites don't track banrate properly, since two bans counts as one total per match. Someone did a spreadsheet or something that properly analyzed banrates, and champs like akali and aphelios has well over 100% ban in total, as 200% is the pseudo-hard-cap, with remakes able to breach it.","replies":[{"poster":"Skia Asteri","date":"2020-01-21T07:32:31.871+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=WoonStruck,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=pLo437TQ,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2020-01-21T06:01:18.768+0000)\n>\n> Season 3 kass actually doesnt have the highest banrate. \n\nIn Season 3 only one team could ban a champion instead of both. To compare in a sensible manner one needs to go by percent of games a champ is banned. By which metric Aphelios, while high, is does not reach the 90% mark for ban rate.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2020-01-21T06:23:04.905+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Aphelios reached 223% banrate on KR recently according to the Riot API.\n\n2 teams = 2 possible bans, and it oddly counts bans from remakes/leaves as well, so it can pass 200%.","replies":[{"poster":"Skia Asteri","date":"2020-01-21T07:23:39.141+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MagicFlyingLlama,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=pLo437TQ,comment-id=00000001,timestamp=2020-01-21T06:23:04.905+0000)\n>\n> Aphelios reached 223% banrate on KR recently according to the Riot API.\n> \n> 2 teams = 2 possible bans, and it oddly counts bans from remakes/leaves as well, so it can pass 200%.\n\nNo, one site's way of calculating it concluded that there was that high of a ban rate from the games they collected as a sample. They added up the total number of bans and divided by the number of sampled games that were not remakes (but included the bans from the remakes when getting the total ban count).\n\nA total stupid way of going about it.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Noodle Wacker","date":"2020-01-21T07:02:16.009+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"None of these 4 really come close to 100%, especially Yasuo and Qiyana.
