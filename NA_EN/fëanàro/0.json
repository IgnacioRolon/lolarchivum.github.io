Did the agent close out your ticket? If so, submit another one, saying that your account was compromised and ask them to repair the damage done.\n\nGood luck!","replies":[{"poster":"Fëanàro","date":"2017-11-07T19:35:00.866+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I asked them about it in the ticket, and they never answered, so i guess they closed it.\n\nThe best would be a rollback to the moment where my password got changed, but i guess it's not possible since people could fake to be hacked to have honor back and stuff...","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-07T23:33:05.727+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As long as we can see proof that the hacker was the one who changed your name, it'd be pretty simple to get that name changed back.
