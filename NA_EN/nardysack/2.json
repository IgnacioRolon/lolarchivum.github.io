I recently was in a game as Ryze, and I dc'ed around 15 mins into the game. (I dc'ed because my wifi stopped working, and I later got back on using my iPhone's personal hotspot). We were winning up until I dc'ed, I presume, as when I got back into the game at around 25 mins, the enemy team was at our inhib, and we had only gotten their tier 1 top and bottom towers. We actually ended up winning the game, and I finished as 7/2/5 if I believe (check my op.gg if that's wrong), but I still got the \"Leaver Buster\" ban for 5 games. Is there any way that I can uplift this because my team won, and I did well, or do I just have to face the consequences? Thanks in advance.","replies":[{"poster":"Skylava","date":"2017-11-28T02:32:54.048+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think it's just the automatic Leaver Buster punishing you for leaving your team at a disadvantage (even though it's not your fault), despite the fact you won :/.\n\nThis has happened to me before and I don't think there is much you can do other than wait the Leaver Buster out, you might find it'll be finished quicker than you think! ;D.

I was quite confused for a little bit, haha.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
