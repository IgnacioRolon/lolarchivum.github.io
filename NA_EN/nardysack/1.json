Is there any way I can fix this? I tried redownloading the game, but that didn't work. This also started to happen to me when I played my first AR-URF game around a week ago.\nThanks in advance.\n\n(EDIT) Here is a photo showing what my loading screen would look like for EVERYBODY loading into the game, and how everyone would be loaded at 0%.\nhttps://i.imgur.com/M4OgRgL.jpg\n\n(EDIT 2) Here is a picture of it happening in a real game.\nhttps://i.imgur.com/gqDFcN8.jpg","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2018-01-03T22:55:42.652+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This one is tough, it could be a network issue or performance.
