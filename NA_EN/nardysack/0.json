My question is; why can Naruto not turn into the Nine Tailed Fox? Killer B can turn into (look exactly like) GyÅ«ki, the eight tailed beast (https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/naruto/images/d/d7/Gyuki.png/revision/latest?cb=20140817221249), but Naruto just gets that orange glowing chakra form of the nine tails and looks like this:\nhttps://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/naruto/images/f/f7/Naruto_transforming.png/revision/latest?cb=20141026161814. Why can't Naruto look like the Nine tails? Thanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Dark Morgana","date":"2017-12-22T01:25:17.001+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"LOVE THIS POST! Starting with that.  SO! The reason why Bee's is different than Naruto's is because every Tailed Beast Transformation is different. Bee decides to take the form of his tailed beast, while Kurama Share's his Chakra with Naruto to give him that tailed beast form. I figure all forms would look different, but you don't get to see too much of that as they  were all killed, nommed on, by the Akatsuki before they get much of a story.","replies":[{"poster":"nardysack","date":"2017-12-22T01:32:37.008+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Dark Morgana,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=j0EqROYW,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-12-22T01:25:17.001+0000)\n>\n> LOVE THIS POST!

So is it Naruto's choice to do this or Kurama's choice, or is it something else?","replies":[{"poster":"Dark Morgana","date":"2017-12-22T01:34:46.844+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=twocanz,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=j0EqROYW,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2017-12-22T01:32:37.008+0000)\n>\n> So technically, Naruto COULD turn into Kurama, but Kurama chooses to give Naruto his chakra to give him that form instead of turning him into a big ol&#x27; fox?

Have you finished it yet, or are yous still working on getting to the end?","replies":[{"poster":"nardysack","date":"2017-12-22T01:44:15.895+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Dark Morgana,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=j0EqROYW,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2017-12-22T01:34:46.844+0000)\n>\n> In all fairness I believe it&#x27;s both of their choice to take on that form.

The Fourth Great Ninja War just started, and Naruto and Killer B just escaped their confinement (I really don't wanna say much because I might spoil it). I'm still working on getting to the end, and I have tried to not look anything up, because my friend looked up lots of things which spoiled it for him causing him to lose enjoyment in the series. \n\nAlso, thanks for answering my question even though it was kind of out of the blue!","replies":[{"poster":"Dark Morgana","date":"2017-12-22T01:47:31.057+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{sticker:sg-janna}} \n\nYou have so much to learn and watch young grasshopper! MWAhahahahahahah The fourth great Ninja War is just the beginning of the amazingingness that is Naruto Shippuden and Naruto's abilities with the Jinchuriki. Enjoy it :D","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
