Make sure that your OS is up to date so it has all necessary products!  If the issue persists then your settings might be a bit too restricting and not allowing your game files to be read.  You'll want to run through the [permissions](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) guide to get that restored.  I hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
