So not only he got buffed by needing less Mana for rotation, he got the Mana refund on top of it.\n\nWith extended combos, he will usually just use more Es and Qs, where Es are unchanged and this just means paying 40 more Mana per repeated Q. He would need to cast it three times in one combo (omegalul) to pay 30 more mana at which point it gets refunded by the new W mechanic requiring 500 - 300 Mana.\n\nSo I can't find the \"the mana cost of his other spells are taking the potential refund into account\" part.
