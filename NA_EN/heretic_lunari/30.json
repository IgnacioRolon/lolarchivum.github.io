If a pipe is changed, modified, or designed to function as a cup, and the user uses it as a cup, then yes - for all intents and purposes, it is a cup. \n\nIf Ekko's clockhand is designed similar to a bat, fufills the purpose of a bat, and he uses it like a bat, then yes - it is a bat. While calling it a bat severely undermines its potential, but it isnt wrong.

Its  a piece of a clock if it no longer functions as a time-telling device, being used as a bat. For all intents and purposes, its a bat. If you called it, \"Ekko's Clock-hand,\" players without knowledge of its origin would be confused.
