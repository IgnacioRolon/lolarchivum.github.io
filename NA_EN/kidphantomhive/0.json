Every level you get a key fragment.  Earlier levels take less XP than later levels, as with pretty much all video games.  Each (player) month you're reset to level 0 (which means it's now easier to get keys again).\n\nThis structure helps newer players or players that can't play a bunch in a given month still make meaningful progress towards unlocking their chests without giving super engaged players all of their key fragments day 1.","replies":[{"poster":"Nicorus ","date":"2016-03-23T02:23:14.623+0000","up_votes":90,"down_votes":5,"body":"Why?
