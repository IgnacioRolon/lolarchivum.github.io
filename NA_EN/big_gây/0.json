Because I havent seen a single rioter comment on anything about this issue until now. \n\nBonus: You are not going to fix the issues of lp loss, simply because you do not want to, or can not. Which either way is an error within its self. I see my low prio is gone, however there are still hundreds of people that were effected by the issue and get no reward or apology. Just that \"the servers came down with a cold.\" \n\nNot only is that a slap to the face, it's a disappointment.
