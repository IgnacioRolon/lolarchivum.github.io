Well this is what I do in my head for my concepts, with the need for some moderate math.\n\nI have a personal affinity for the kit design and cohesion side of concept design. First and foremost, I look at what I want my concept to do anf be best at. Then I ask, what are things they will be weak at. I look my skills them in terms of laning, sieges and objective dances, skirmishes and full on teamfights in this sandbox mode in my head. I play many different scenarios and see their kits will perform in their intented strengths and weaknesses in winning and losing battles per scenario.\n\nAs for numerical balance, time for pen(cil) and paper. Just add up the base numbers and thier bonuses at level one and each ultimate rank up. Say for AD, 50 / 125 / 275 / 350 / 425 and AP at 20 / 200 / 450 / 600.  Do they feel OP, above thier role damage expectation, etc? How about now adding in auto attack damage between? \n\nThese are the two major things I do to try and balance a champion concept. Afterwards, I do more specific but select examples, say my fighter concept vs Darius in lane. How fun/boring would that be?\n\nOverall, it's part science, and part art. How this helps man.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Tamur","date":"2015-10-14T22:52:27.441+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Champion review [trade](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/Vw6oEkvm-tamurs-concept-thread)?","replies":[{"poster":"showcase25","date":"2015-10-15T12:51:59.683+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not a problem.
