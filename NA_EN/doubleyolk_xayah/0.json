I wanna ask if I can purchase the icon without getting the border?\r\nI really like the Kiko icon but i saw the icon could only be purchase in a bundle. None of my friends purchase the bundle so it would look super silly if I am the only star guardian with a border. But i really like the icon...\r\nWill the icon be sold separately?

The only way to remove the border would be to remove the icon.
