Maybe gameplay would have been more appropriate. But anyway...\n\nI bought **Arcade Sona** on sale on Tuesday and I immediately noticed it was** visually bugged**. I was wondering why in the skin spotlight the aura range indicators (the circle) have their proper 'arcade' effects (the tiny **pixel rectangles** that you can see in the autoattacks too) while in the live version **no effect is displayed in the aura** (the big blue-green-purple circle) around Sona. I'm sure it's a bug. You feel like playing Classic Sona with another model... Which shouldn't be, I guess?\n\n**However, if I play with other people, they can see the proper effects**. But it's not a problem of my computer because I logged in from a friend's pc, and the problem persists. **I play on EUW** but I think the problem is general. \n\nWithout the pixel rectangles it really feels like something's missing. \n\nI attached three screenshots to display her Q, her W and her E. The ult is fine.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2014-10-18T21:40:23.212+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is a known issue, thanks for the report!","replies":[{"poster":"Sayer Raider","date":"2014-10-19T10:13:57.070+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I hope this can be fixed in the next patch.

I made a post about it but it got no recognition.\n\nEssentially when you play Arcade Sona, you cannot see the pixel sparkles on her aura circle indicator. If someone else plays it, you can still see it. I was playing with my friend who also had Arcade Sona and he and I both noticed this.\n\nThere's nothing you can do about it. \n\nIt can also be seen in this video:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBWVYDtk1hQ","replies":[{"poster":"madamesosostris","date":"2014-10-16T15:46:17.273+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for posting :) The more we are the more there's a chance that this is noticed.

I have it on max graphics (bought her on sale recently), in the auras is just plain there is no arcade effects. Also i tried repair... still didnt change anything. And to others is visible (i guess the visual gaming code when you play the champion is different than  when you see the champion. It has different visual codes) my friend told me that he saw arcade sona and she was fine.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tsen","date":"2014-10-15T09:49:22.438+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Mmm it looks normal to me, like in your screen 11, that's how it looks now after her rework.
