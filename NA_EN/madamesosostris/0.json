I was wondering why in the skin spotlight the aura range indicators (the circle) have their proper 'arcade' effects (the tiny **pixel rectangles** that you can see in the autoattacks too) while in the live version no effect is displayed in the aura (the big blue-green-purple circle) around Sona. I'm sure it's a bug. You feel like playing Classic Sona with another model... Which shouldn't be, I guess?\n\n**However, if I play with other people, they can see the proper effects**. But it's not a problem of my computer because I logged in from a friend's pc, and the problem persists. **I play on EUW but I think the problem is general.**\n\nWithout the pixel rectangles it really feels like something's missing.\n\nI attached three screenshots to display her Q, her W and her E. The ult is fine.\n\nI was wondering if anybody else was experiencing the problem, and if yes, please feel free to post in this thread I created in the bug section, for Sona <3\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report/JWbrGEVE-client-arcade-sona-bugged","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2014-10-17T21:11:06.971+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"You're totally right, she is missing the pixels!

At least, I think it's when she first acts. Usually when she uses an ability on an enemy or something, the game will skip a few frames for everyone in the game. It's happened often enough to me to pinpoint the issue is with Sona.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2014-10-18T21:23:40.521+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> > > > You're totally right, she is missing the pixels!
