I'm pretty sure the majority of players reading the patch notes thought that both those features were already live.","replies":[{"poster":"RottedApples","date":"2016-06-16T00:49:23.455+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well they do this with skins at least in order to catch any last minute issues or bugs or whatnot.

The patch notes were worded quite poorly. I logged on for a quick game before work, and after the match everybody in ARAM was pretty much \"Where's my rank? Where are my champion points?\" All of us logged on to play just for that. BM riot!","replies":[]}]}
