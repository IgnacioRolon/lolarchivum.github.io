The new stats are as followed (according to surrenderat20.net):\r\n\r\nSheen\r\n    Cost reduced to 1050 from 1250\r\n    No longer grants 25 AP\r\n    Mana increased to 250 from 200\r\n    Now grants 10% CDR\r\n\r\nI think the new Sheen will be a must have first buy for Nasus now, whereas most people would buy Kindlegem or Glacial Shroud first for the CDR (depending if they were facing AD/AP lane opponent). Another change that I think looks really good is the Iceborn Gauntlet changes, which now grants additional CDR (up to 20%, due to CDR now on Sheen plus the 10% from Glacial Shroud), and slow area increases based on bonus armor, making it potentially more rewarding for building tankier.","replies":[{"poster":"DingleNutsMcGee","date":"2015-10-30T21:10:31.800+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Triforce and sheen not having any AP now is a nerf.

If you go 12/18/0 and take 5% CDR in runes, you can start the game with 25% CDR with a 45% CDR cap. {{item:3057}} gives 10% CDR now for 35%, and get like a {{item:3067}} to get 45% CDR really early.
