Base Energy regens significantly quicker than Base Mana. They don't even have to worry about Mana items. They can just rush {{item:3155}}.\n\n Most mages have to worry about Health, Ability Power, Magic Pen, Mana/Mana Regen, Cooldown Reduction, Armor/Resists.\n\nAD Mids like {{champion:238}} {{champion:157}} don't need to worry about Mana. They can just spam skills as much as they want. \n\nI mean what truly is the Mage counterpart to {{item:3155}} ? {{item:3191}}  doesn't offer a shield at low HP that is quantified by the Armor on the item AND the base Armor/Runes. Definitely can't be {{item:3136}}. Let's be real now, this offers absolutely no armor or shield AND costs 300g more than Hex.\n\nNot to mention AD Champions have SIGNIFICANTLY stronger Auto Attacks because of the AD Items. AP Items hardly increase a Mages Autos. AD Champs siege quicker and when both the AD and AP Champs use all their Cooldowns, the AD Champion can still Auto Attack.\n\nHell even the Starter items for AD/AP Midlaners are biased.\n\nLook at {{item:1056}} , it offers NO spellvamp. It offers Mana Regen because Mages are typically dependant on this secondary resource to either push/poke/all-in.\n\nNow look at the infamous {{item:1055}} . This offers Lifesteal, because let's be real Zed and Yasuo don't use Mana. So even if a Zed/Yasuo starts playing really safe after you win a trade against them, they can just farm jungle camps, crab, or minions to lifesteal undo the whole process, which ultimately means longer lanephase or even earlier roaming.\n\nI've been in countless cases where Dorans Blade 1 potion would outsustain a Dorans Ring 2 potion scenario. It's just WAY more cost effective to play AD Mids, almost forced in high elo.\n\nDorans Blade can potentially lifesteal a Zed/Yasuo mid up to 5-10 Health Potions, not to mention they don't even need Mana so they can spam abilities/poke/push/siege at free will. A LOT more than what a Dorans Ring can offer.\n\nNot to mention, now with {{item:3147}} , Every AD champion who builds it INCLUDING {{champion:238}} , now gets a Mini-zed ulti bonus to finish off when you flee the scene. Mages don't have an item that can do this. {{item:3151}} does like almost nothing at low Health. {{item:3285}} I can only see this being a finisher with combinations of Ignite + DoT from {{champion:69}} {{champion:105}} {{champion:90}}  or other AP chamions with DoT.\n\nLet's be real again though, that's not going to finish an AD Champion who rushes {{item:3155}} . The shield auto-procs, it doesn't need to be skillfully activated. It doesn't forget to proc when the user is low on Health. It's way too cost effective and easy to obtain. Nearly every high elo game I've played, everyone rushes it. Hell I've even seen some Mages rush this item because of how cost effective it is.

Or if i am to exxagerate like most of this thread i was killing all of them! SOLO!\n\nI dont have problem admiting that ad are a bit stronger now(especially Corki is a major offender mostly due to mix damage). But a 4 ad comp is asking for problems. \n\nAP have great assasination options in the hands of Ahri and Leblanc and i am talking top picks here. You can add other in that pool like Fizz or Diana.\n\nNo Ad mid will come close to the utility of Ori or Lux. There is a reason why almost all the immigrant supports are from Mid. They have utility. Annie is actually a viable mid. \n\nTop has been mostly bruisers and tanks but lets not forget how many nerfs Lulu took for that (and as a support main i hate i cant play her to her full potential, she was the funniest support to play when released). Ryze is also a choise if you want to have someone with hyperscaling top. And you can protect him. Also Swain can shutdown melee tops better than adcs.\n\nWith the exception of Corki, AP dominate the siege game as mid . They are the backbone of any siege comp (mostly for their combination of waveclear, teamfighting and poke) along with a long range bit ADC. Varus comes behind the likes of Lux, Xerath. And no, Yasuo or Zed cant wave clear as safe. Even Victor have it better.\n\nBetter teamfight presence for AP mids. I dont think that needs to be explained.\n\nArmor stacking is real. You need one AP champ because if frontline gets 3 armor items you are done for good. Bruisers that have Tabi, Titanic and one armor item can snowball the mid game due to the amount of physical damage they have and can take . Corki ofc is the offender here.\n\nZhonyans indeed has one of the best actives no matter what and it pays it heavily in price (check out how much Talisman gives for a mini Sivir ult). But it still can avoid a lot damage. Was Maw line a bit too good? Yeap but it got nerfed. Speaking of items, the overall dps of ad items was nerfed with the revamp and almost noone bothered to do the maths. Also i still consider Ludens a major offender. RoA is actually pretty good and is picked a lot.\n\nI am not saying that AP is stronger than AD. Yeah they are a tad weaker. But saying that adcs dominate is a blatant lie. Ap still have options (and many like Anivia were not mentionedand) that was the point of all the above. Massively exaggerating does not lead anywhere.\nTop sees a huge variety this season from pseudo adcs (Graves and Quinn) to bruisers, light fighters and tanks. Some ap also make appearance there mostly Lulu.\nAhri and Leblanc dominate mid(mobility and better late teamfight than their ad counterparts) but we also see other there like classic mages (lux surpassed zed in nerf topics), Corki (shrug) melee ad assasins and Cho \"anti-assasin\" Gath.\nJungle is curious. From farm junglers(yi/shy) to early gangers(elise lee vi) to massive frontliners.\nBot is boring. Morde seemed a hopeful attempt but yeah adc dominate there. I would love to see a couple healthy Morde-like champions to have variety.

Because 4AD comps were always pretty common. An AD toplaner like Darius, Renekton, Jax or Gnar. An AD Mid like Zed, Jayce, or Varus. An AD Jungler like Lee, Reksai, Wukong, or Pantheon. Then an ADC. \n\nIf you mean \"4adc comps\", well you have options. You can play tanks that do well against ADCs (Rammus, Malphite, Taric, Braum). You can play Assassins. You can play AoE mages who can burst out the entire team (Orianna, Lux). Xin, Yi, and Irelia can all splitpush well and 1v1 any ADC.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Anomander","date":"2016-03-29T07:47:03.420+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{champion:54}} {{champion:33}} {{champion:44}} ............","replies":[]},{"poster":"Negrotiense","date":"2016-03-29T15:01:43.623+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"If it's a problem you should at least try to explain why...","replies":[{"poster":"The Voids Call","date":"2016-03-29T16:21:35.173+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"I specifically didn't explain why in the OP, because opening the discussion almost always gets more attention than stating your opinion.
