Why doesn&#039;t Riot have some way to view them in the client or at least on their own website? The descriptions currently given in the client are woefully useless to anyone but a new player who is just trying to get a grasp of the kits.\r\n\r\nFor example, when I wanted to see details about Nautilus&#039; passive, the League client tells me &quot;Nautilus&#039; basic attacks deal bonus physical damage and immobilize his targets. This effect cannot happen more than once every few seconds on the same target,&quot; while the wiki says, &quot;Nautilus&#039;s basic attacks deal 8 - 110 (based on level) bonus physical damage and root his target for 0.5 / 0.75 / 1 / 1.25 / 1.5 seconds.&quot; as well as telling me the \r\non-target cooldown is 9/8/7/6 seconds (changing every 5 levels).\r\n\r\nI don&#039;t see any reason why Riot would not want to show players this information, or why they would force players to use third-party websites to find out details that are important for the game. Me and many other players really want to know this information and would like some way to view it either in the client or at least on League&#039;s own website.\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration, I look forward to a reply.","replies":[{"poster":"AirSonance","date":"2018-01-17T08:34:57.780+0000","up_votes":24,"down_votes":1,"body":"Some of them are also unusually vague about their effects.

I think the problem initially was that, back when Riot was still a startup, it didn't really have the internal manpower to extensively document and update their own game info. As such, dedicated players have been more than happy to help out and do the job themselves, free of charge. Now that the company has grown, however, it feels like they've taken these external resources for granted, and have chosen to uphold the status quo by not making any plans to create official, internal equivalents. Effectively, we're in this state where pretty much everyone knows to go to the wiki for proper in-game info, and for S@20 for PBE content, and because those sites are stable and generally reliable, Riot doesn't see any reason to change from that situation.\n\nThe issue I take with this is that, while it may have been justifiable for Riot to rely on player contributions in its startup days, it isn't now that the company is big enough to need to take on that responsibility themselves. Riot is currently a 2.5k+ employee company that is still relying on fan-made content to supply essential information and news about their game, and on top of that, the communities performing these services receive no real official recognition or acknowledgment. What's more, I think Riot could learn a lot from the wiki and how the latter structures and displays information, but the most talk I've seen about that space are some minor red comments about how the wiki is wrong on X bit of data, which a player had to glean by going into the game, pulling up a note pad and writing down what they saw (and League's tooltips have themselves been wrong on more than one occasion). It feels like all that work's been taken for granted, and as a result Riot's official information sources have been left to rot: Riot clearly has the space on their client to list all of the information they need, and even an official blog to list PBE updates, so it wouldn't be all that difficult to just copy the abridged version of S@20 and the wiki onto their own resources (in fact, it would be easier, since Riot has all of the internal data they need), but so far that hasn't been done, to the detriment of their playerbase, and especially newer players.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pale Pirate","date":"2018-01-17T12:01:23.608+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Even the wiki is not that good. For example you can't go to a champion, and see the rankings of each of their base stats and growths compared to other champions. You have to look them up one by one which is tedious. In that sense, it's surprising no developer has come up with a tool to make that easier.","replies":[{"poster":"Ayzev","date":"2018-01-17T14:50:36.310+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wiki does have that though.

It's on the wiki, but even there and in-game, certain elements are elusive and not visible.\n\nThe wiki vaguely references that they scale, but even in-game, the turrets scale weird and not quite as reflected by the wiki. Placed turrets do not scale with a skill ranking, however newly placed turrets will update with a new stat set. If you buy AP, the output isn't necessarily reflected on current turrets, but only newly placed ones.\n\nIt's really more vague than it should be for a core skill.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Total Eclipse","date":"2018-01-17T04:37:43.703+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"+1!!!!!","replies":[]}]}
