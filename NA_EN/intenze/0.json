Would love an  explanation and thoughts ?","subforum":"Player Behavior","embed":{"description":null,"url":"https://i.imgur.com/Xn3zY2u.jpg","image":null},"up_votes":2,"down_votes":15,"body":"To be honest as i always am, i got a 2 week suspension for insulting ppl. since i get my blood pressure up pretty fast if i see someone failing. . .  i used that  time to reflect back on how to  to stay sharp and play the game in the most calm way possible .  Without insulting anyone and evading any negative words and negativity  focusing more on the objectives and general logical steps needed to win.  My account was unbaned last night at 20:15 . it got permabaned at 02 :35. or something after i played  few ranked games .  I had the pleasure of playing a ranked game with a player that decided to lock in AP TF mid vs a zed mid.  knowing how that will play out when we started i asked the jungler to focus on ganking mid since i assume that tf would have some issues with zed pass lvl 6.  during the matchup our mid tf and vayne figured they speak the same language and got tight.  trying to blame volibear jungle after tf fed 0/5 in 9minutes. in witch i responded that  tf loses 1v1 zed pass lvl 6 obviously.  so they turned on my telling me to stop defending my lane and go babysit mid . . . witch i couldnt do. since i was laning vs agresive urgot @ top. and our tf got tilted since he said he locked in tf casue he ,,likes plalying him'' to witch i replied the point on normal games is to have fun and casually test builds and ranked is ftw. ... picking  tf vs zed is the same as ash/varus or any other squishy champ that he can nuke in his combo without u being able to do anything.  i said it's just a bad matchup and i  wish i could od more to help out with the game. .. so they started blaming me for flaming him, for stating a known fact regarding balance and counters... and started threatning me with reports.   ..  i did one gank @ mid  to try to help but ended up geting counterganked...so  then they again turned on voli jungle threatning him...  since i couldnt def my top anymore since our mid did 0 pings and fed zed 15/0  i again stated that im not blaming anyone that it's just a bad matchup and that tf would maybe work better on any other player playing zed / or other champ. trying to relax the tention in chat casue they were flaming as hell but i was again met with we will report u for saying anything to tf....and tilting him.  SOooo.....  to conclude my little saga here i am pretty much amazed by the environment  special snowlakes are being bread in. . . Say  that zed counters ashe/tf/varus/or give any example of basic logic can end up in some snowflake getting tilted and his feelings hurt and that can be a reason for a premanent ban ? are we creating such a snowflake friendly game that they cant be told the basic common logic the game is founded on , outplays etc without being furt by facts?  If u say to someone that one champ counters another is that a form of verbal abuse? is that inflammatory?   i repeated several times i wish i  could have done more but as trynda top my actions were pretty limited. but it still wasnt enough ....  so now idk how to play anymore... try to help , u get reported, try to calm ppl down get reported, state logical fact about counters ppl get feelings hurt and u get banned.   If i play on my own without talking /muting all i get that i am uncooperative etc....  so  i would love  if riot could explain to me what exactly i did wrong here. i would really appreciate it. if they took the time to do so. also  to the player base. i would love to hear ur opinions on this....  theyr explenation was that they are reporting me for ,,crying... so \r\n\r\n\r\ni am providing all of my chat  in written format here : https://i.imgur.com/ytDKPU1.jpg \r\nand images of the chat here : https://i.imgur.com/Xn3zY2u.jpg \r\nlink of the match in qestion : https://matchhistory.euw.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/EUW1/4048377083/38216328?tab=overview \r\ni would love to get some info on what i did wrong so i know how to correct my behavior in the future.,..  or are we creating a safe space/heaven for special snowflakes that are unable to grasp that  there are some champs that counter others O.o ???","replies":[{"poster":"MordridtheBlack","date":"2019-05-31T13:21:05.306+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":2,"body":"for those stating the op did nothing wrong\n\nyou are the problem with League\n\nthe op, in this game was; flaming/harassing/toxic to the tf\n\nthis is also a lot of chat for a 26 min game, there comes a point where it is no longer advice or criticism...it is a distraction; to you and your team\n\nit doesn't matter what he did or what he picked. you were flat out warned when you got your 14 day suspension \"Further actions may result in a permban\"\n\nlikely, you got reported, and thus banned\n\nRiot, as far as I know, does not overturn permbans unless made in error...this was not in error\n\nyou could have easily just not said a thing in chat within a few minutes of realizing the tf either; wasn't listening, or trolling/inting\n\nthere was literally no reason for this giant wall of text in chat","replies":[]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-05-31T11:09:03.161+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":4,"body":"You spent the entire match - literally the whole thing, start to finish - harassing your mid laner about picking TF into Zed. You had one single constructive message, \"play him as ad.\" That was approximately 1% of your chat. If TF into Zed was such a problem to you, you should've said something in pick phase or dodged. Going on and on during the match about how it's impossible for him to win that lane was not helpful.\n\nBy the way, I'm guessing that when you said in post-game that you don't care about being banned, that was in response to teammates saying they were going to report you. If that's the case, I hope you reported them for that; announcing intent to report or calling for reports is considered harassment.","replies":[{"poster":"POSEKOTINA","date":"2019-05-31T11:18:01.947+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":9,"body":"how can u force a person to pick other champs. xD?     he would have locked in tf assuming from pics he rly wanted to play tf regardless of who he's  laning vs.  Also he didnt say one inflamatory thing . far as i can see he was stating facts.  and ppl got offended by facts . but facts dont care about ur feelings :O","replies":[{"poster":"IFeltLikeAGringo","date":"2019-06-01T03:24:01.417+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=POSEKOTINA,realm=EUW,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=YMPopryX,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2019-05-31T11:18:01.947+0000)\n>\n> how can u force a person to pick other champs. xD?     he would have locked in tf assuming from pics he rly wanted to play tf regardless of who he's  laning vs.  Also he didnt say one inflamatory thing . far as i can see he was stating facts.  and ppl got offended by facts . but facts dont care about ur feelings :O\n\nCalling a fat person a \"fatass\" is stating a fact too.

Also im pretty sure you dint would like it either if sombody points out your mistakes every stap of the way some people play a bad game that stuff happens. What not should happen is that sombody starts pointing out those mistakes its bad for the player and the moral of the rest of the team.

Thats the key here I think. You seem to think your opinion is needed in game. Like you must speak your opinion on why your team is losing or something. Why dontyou try just not doing that?  No compliments. No begging. No insults. Is that feasible to you? Try it. Its almost freeing when you realize how little people care about your opinion, and how little your opinion actually matters in a game of league. And speaking of that, why did you talk about the TF so much? Like, why was that so important to you to talk about it? It doesnt affect the outcome of the match.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
