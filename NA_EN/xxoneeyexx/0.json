[Leaverbuster](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ) will treat all leaves equally even if it is not intended because of the negative experiences it still causes for others.  I suggest going over the [game crash](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes+) guide completely to get this fixed up and complete any lower priority queues.

I too have had this happen to me recently and been on both sides of it. I was able to reconnect to the game but still got penalized. We won that game btw. Having the same issues but this punishment is ridiculous. Never had any bugsplat issues BEFORE the client update but low and behold the second I update clients BOOM bugsplat, 10 minutes to reconnect after running all the troubleshooting i could, gave up and just restarted pc. Punishment for those frantically trying to relog into the game is absurd. Well you disconnected might as well stay disconnected because even if you get back into the game you are still going to be punished. Thanks ~~Obama~~ ~~Riot~~ Rito","replies":[]}]}]}
