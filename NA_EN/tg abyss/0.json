I tried to recover my password and username, however I was unable to do both. I know that I am stupid to even click on the link (riot gives a big warning to not click on links), but I was wondering if there is a chance that I will be able to recover my account. I've been playing ritually since season 2 and would not like to see my account sit there to decay for eternity. my main account is Perpiex","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-17T02:59:18.380+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"We can certainly help you in recovering this account if you reach out in a [Support Ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).
