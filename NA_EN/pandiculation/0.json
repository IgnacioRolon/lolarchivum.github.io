I checked everything. and it was the client's problem. After hours of uninstalling and reinstalling, I finally got to a point where I could log in. However, the update was stuck at 0%. I went back and started uninstalling and reinstalling, and now all I get is the folder that is shown in the ss provided.\r\n\r\nTL;DR Tried to fix my client and wound up with a client w/o all of it's files.\r\n\r\nAny advice? If I can get a full client redownloaded it's possible that all I'd need to do is use Hextech Repair.\r\n\r\nThanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-25T00:19:16.258+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea it looks like you're having some issues getting League to install correctly. Since uninstalling may not actually hit every single file, make sure you grab our [**Hextech Repair Tool**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367-Automated-Troubleshooting-Hextech-Repair-Tool) and run it with the options **reinstall and clean uninstall** checked. That'll make sure all the files are wiped from your system and you get a fresh start.\n\nAfter that, make sure you have all the correct [**permissions**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) in place so that League is allowed to scan and update it's own files.","replies":[]}]}
