Okay, so I lose 30 and gain 8. that's cool. I  quickly lost D2 obviously.\r\n\r\nI then climbed back from D3 to D2, and despite still maintaining a 54% winrate and having 20 wins over losses, with a 3 loss spree (one of which was at 0, rest were not) I get demoted AGAIN to D3. Not to mention, while I was in D2 my losses were still always more than my gains. Even when I beat the system and climbed back into D2, I was punished with imbalanced gains/losses that I have never ever seen before in all 4 seasons of ranked.\r\nThe fact that Riot would add master's tier and actually screw up Diamond mmr near the end of the season is just mind-boggling to me. Grinding for master's/challenger now, if you weren't already D1, is basically 100% luck-based as it seems you will never gain more LP than you lose once you hit D2. If you even get one uncarriable team you'll be down the LP of 1.5 games and be closer to trolls in D3 that will just drag you down more.\r\n\r\nThanks Riot for really thinking this through. But who am I kidding, they did this to protect Challenger player's rankings anyway. They don't want to see new faces at high rank.","replies":[]}
