(Due to chat toxicity, not to in-game griefing)\r\n\r\nAll I do is actually carrying about games, and sometimes it happens to me to say shit. \r\nIt&#039;s okay, but it happens to AT LEAST 25% of the community, and I&#039;m pretty sure a huge amount of ACTUALLY ACTIVE accoutnts have been restricted at least once in their life (personal experience with in-game people, who just told me that)\r\n\r\nI&#039;ve been hearing many opinions also from the non-restricted players, that the current system is pointless, as there are were more ways to deal with toxicity than permbanning people. Since I can admit I am being a &quot;toxic player&quot;, with the quotes as myself - I find myself toxic in 5% of the games I actually play, and it&#039;s not as toxic as most of the people I meet in my games.\r\n\r\nMy question is - Will the system of permbanning people ever change? Otherwise I see no point of playing this anymore, even though I&#039;ve played this game since season 2, and until the new system got implemented I had never been banned for toxicity, I was just restricted a couple of times before, but it could be really, really rarely. \r\n\r\nI&#039;m taking a break of the game, and I&#039;m hoping the riot&#039;s current system will ever change into anything actually fighting against toxicity, as this one isn&#039;t really working well. Those really, hardly toxic players will just create new accounts and do the same shit over again. \r\n\r\nI tried to &quot;think about myself&quot;, but I played a couple of times with never restricted players and got restricted/banned after playing with them - they simply couldn&#039;t understand why I was banned.\r\n\r\nIf you really want to know what would actually help against toxicity in the opinion of the toxic player:\r\n\r\n- Being unable to play ranked games for a specific time (It used to be here before from what I remember)\r\n\r\n- Being completely unable to communicate via chat in-game\r\n\r\n- If feeding or behaving toxic in any other way than talking - being banned for a specific time (For eg. 2 weeks, going up by a week / 2 weeks every single time after a ban) - that&#039;d definitely prevent people from feeding on purpose (I don&#039;t int-feed by myself just saying)\r\n\r\n- Being chat-restricted for a long period of time\r\n\r\n- Being banned for a longer period of time after constantly behaving toxic.\r\n\r\nI can just say I&#039;m being really sad, since I tried a lot of things since saying just simply sorry after tilting in-game - to trying to restrict myself by some autohotkey scripts.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m simply a kind of person who actually cares about winning the game and does everything to make it happen. \r\n\r\nI&#039;ll keep hoping this system will change someday, so I can start playing again as it&#039;s my passion.  \r\n\r\nIf you had never been restricted - you&#039;re lucky, I wish I could be as calm as you.\r\n\r\nHave a nice day readers.","replies":[{"poster":"Mãge","date":"2016-10-12T15:33:33.036+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"When the system bans you permanently from the community, it's saying to you \"we don't want this type of behavior of this severity in the community at all\". It's not saying to you \"your behavior is beyond normal limits so we'll just restrict your chat\". If you've been banned so many times, it's everyone's way of saying you're part of the top 0.5% most negative and unwanted players in the community. I've had a LOT of bad days, and I've never been chat restricted. Sometimes I feel I should have been chat restricted and I didn't get chat restricted. If you've been restricted that many times and even permanently banned that many times, you should stop playing this game or **dramatically** change your behavior.","replies":[{"poster":"Lime Horse King","date":"2016-10-12T21:00:46.770+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":7,"body":"This is the most retarded shit ive read today.

You can never predict the future and, while the Instant Feedback system seems to be good for now, things may change in the future. Riot's always looking to level up their stuff, so I wouldn't be too surprised if it did change at some point. But for now, there are no known plans to change.\n\nA lot of your suggestions are good, but they seem to be going the route of least responsibility. At some point, you need to own up to your actions and take responsibility for them. You also need to learn how to properly communicate with other people to play this game, which is why a lot of \"permanent chat restriction\" suggestions wouldn't help solve the problem.\n\nYou're not lucky if you have never been punished.

IP bans are not reliable **and** have collateral damage. There's no bullet to bite when it only solves a tiny fraction of the problem and creates new (and significantly larger) problems.\n2. So Riot \"needs\" to eliminate report weight, but you don't even know in detail how it works? Can you elaborate please how you know then, that this is what Riot \"needs\" to do to fix toxicity?\n3. There are enough possiblities to self-mute as long as you put in just a tiny bit of effort. If people don't want to do that, there is no difference between them and the people Riot essentially permanently chat restricted, which just ended up venting their anger and frustration by feeding and trolling... things you yourself want to put an emphasis on.\n4. This is basically the same point as #2, in that you are making that suggestion purely on your assumption of Riot's current focus. Just compare the rate of manual reviews on chat related behaviour to that of feeding and trolling. You are trying to shift the focus from something that no longer is the focus of manual work.\n\nSorry, but you are oversimplifying the solutions to this problem. None of your suggestions would actually fix toxicity.\n\nEdit: Just an example to make clear **how** easy it is to circumvent IP bans: Some people, like me don't even have to actively try.\nEven if I were IP banned without knowing, and I also didn't have any knowledge of networking, I would still \"circumvent\" that ban within 24 hours. I could speed things up, of course, but without doing anything myself, I still get a new IP whenever my router does its 24h-reconnect.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sarutobi","date":"2016-10-12T16:24:12.331+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=scazzman,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=2xaZhUmd,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2016-10-12T15:38:03.145+0000)\n>\n> what riot needs to do to fix toxicity\n> \n> * bite the bullet and start IP banning anyone who has more than 3 permabanned accounts\n> * eliminate hidden report weight or at least explain in detail how it works\n> * allow players prone to raging the option to mute themselves to avoid punishment \n> * put less emphasis on &quot;negative chat&quot; and more emphasis on trolling, feeding, and negative gameplay\n\nIP banning will never work as you'll be banning innocent players. There are things like Internet cafes, schools/university, as well as shared homes. Basically what it are saying when dealing with IP bans,in the case of typer1 from what I understand that dude was in school or a dorm. And by that logic every single person sharing that internet at the school should be ban for one persons mistake!\n\nYour second point I think is great.it would help get an understanding for people who report, as well as people who abuse it.\n\nI highly doubt they'll do anything to give people a way to permachat ban themself.this game is about communication. If you cannot handle something that simple please just find another game.\n\nYour last point implies they don't do anything to trolls/feeders. As far as I know they are treated harsher than people who are toxic in chat. As with toxic behavior you have about 3 chances.whereas feeders and trolls only have one!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"jpguy902","date":"2016-10-12T15:53:08.869+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you're taking time to flame in chat, then that means less time spent actually playing the game.
