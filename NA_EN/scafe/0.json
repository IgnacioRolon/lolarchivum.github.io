When I booted up my PC this morning, the shortcut was a blank white image, and it would not start. I then uninstalled league of legends, and fully cleaned my computer of it with CC cleaner. Now whenever I try to install league of legends, the startup only gives me the ability to remove, not repair or install. Everytime I hit remove, it fails abruptly, and just gives me an option to \"finish\" the removal. I'm looking for a fix to this, so I can install league of legends and play again :^)","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-07-08T21:37:07.019+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This could be a security setting or antivirus blocking it from processing.

It still only gives me the \"remove\" option on startup, and after completion it says \"League of Legends setup ended prematurely because of an error\". I tried making another administrative account on my computer, and even that didn't work.","replies":[]}]}]}
