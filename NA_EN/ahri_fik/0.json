Why do you want another skin?\n\nThey have 2 skins not including her default, and the last one was made in 2016, over 3 years ago at this point. That's over 1,000 days, or 1,145 days to be exact. They desperately need a new one. \n\nPlus there are plenty of champs who get a skin almost every few months, and champs with 10+ skins. Kai'Sa had just gotten a new skin a few months ago, and she just got another one.\n\nI don't think any champion, despite how unpopular they might be, should go 3 years without a new skin, because this game being what it is, there's still a good handful of Kindred one-tricks. I used to be one (a terrible one at that), and Kindred is the champ with a design that really caught my attention and made me interested in playing the game. \n\nIn my personal opinion, the 2 skins they do have, aren't all that great. As much as I'd love a Kindred rework, they really don't need one. They have a pretty clear kit and play-style, and it feels good to play.

Those who are ready to accept their death, receive a swift death from one of the lambs arrows. Those who try to out run their death or otherwise resist are met with a terrifying demise at the maw of the wolf.\n\nMain things: Wolf does not feel like he is a part of \"Kindred\". In gameplay, Lamb=Kindred, Wolf=pet/subordinate. It doesn't feel like they are 2 aspects of the same being. Also, being the aspect of death, she doesn't \"save people\" from death, or delay it. Simply put, she collects.\n\nI could write a longer answer but am not afforded the time at present.","replies":[{"poster":"Chembaron Yamada","date":"2019-07-05T18:55:01.920+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is a story in universe, called \"A good death\". It makes it seem that you don't necessarily have to die to encounter Kindred. This is basically the scenario from this story.\n>“No,” said Lamb, “though it is a nice thought. Fear not, little maiden, we are just having our fun. You have come to us tonight; we have not come for you.” \n\nSo I think the ult is fine in that way.\n\n____________________\n\nAbout Wolf not being integrated in the gameplay that much, I talked about this quite a bit in discussions about Kindred. I used to share the same thought, but over time, I changed my mind. I think it might actually be intended and makes good sense thematically.\n\nKindred are a representation of the Yin and Yang motive. Two opposites complimenting each other, I am sure you are aware of that.\nLamb is the female, wolf is the male. Wolf knows nothing, but feels everything. Lamb feels nothing, but knows everything. Lamb is calm, calculated, and gentle. Wolf is impulsive, aggressive (you could go as far as calling him cruel), and driven by his emotions.\n\nAnd that's the reason why I think Kindred's gameplay makes sense. Lamb is the one we are controlling. Because Lamb is the logical, **controlled** side of Kindred. Wolf is impulsive and pretty much uncontrollable. Just like in the game, it seems that lamb can just tell wolf what he should or shouldn't do, but there is no _direct_ control over him.\n\nThat's why I think that it makes sense that wolf is pretty much driven by an AI in the W instead of a controllable entity by itself. It works with their thematics that we take _control_ of the part of Kindred, which is actually _controllable_, while the impulsive _uncontrollable_ side can be unleashed, but not directly played by us.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
