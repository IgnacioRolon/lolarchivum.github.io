I have been in contact with 2 of Riot's Tech Supports through the League of Legends Support Tickets, and have extensively communicated my issues here on the forum as well... as @Broporo can attest to. \n\nRiot asked me to run a program called Win_MTR which can check for ping spikes one might experience.\nThey gave me the following addresses to run and check\n192.64.170.252\n104.160.131.1\nGoogle.com (this is obviously the control group)\n\nThe results it gave me were basically that there was a ping issue between me and the Riot Server in Chicago. According to Riot this would be a problem with my ISP, although I am not entirely convinced of this, as many other people have been reporting similar issues. \n\nA little earlier my client automatically repatched itself, I assume done by Riot remotely. I have not yet tested whether the issues of freezes in Champ Select, DC's, and lag spikes in-game have been resolved.\n\nI hope this may be of help to you.\n\nKind regards,\nH33P","replies":[]},{"poster":"Enox","date":"2017-09-03T23:19:20.365+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"bump this shit is stressing me the fuck out","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-30T21:35:50.981+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Those loading screens can often freeze if your network loses its connection with our network.
