People are currently complaining about the strongest members of each element/origin (Zed, Malz, Olaf, etc) but this is also obnoxious.\r\n\r\nFirstly I have a problem with the proposed reason for it; \"We're decreasing the number of each champion in the pool. It will be much more difficult for multiple players to build similar teams. Keep an eye on what your opponents are building and find the open synergies for maximum success.\"\r\n\r\nThis would be fine if there wasn't such huge disparity between the best and the worst comps. This means whoever gets theirs first either gets it uncontested or potentially gets mutually screwed over by the guy who is also building it.\r\n\r\nRight now in the last 5 matches I played in there were 43 three star champions (one game had the 2nd place players team missing from the match history so presumably slightly higher). Of those 43 champions, 22 were tier 1 champions. and in one game 2 of the tier one 3 star champions were the same champion. This is just way too many for what you are given for getting just a single three star champion in the first place.\r\n\r\nIn many games the first or second place player is just whoever gets the most gold champs in their set. Several of them have the first or second place player with at least 3 gold champions, some times as many as five (and in one particular case 7 separate gold champions).","replies":[{"poster":"Porglit","date":"2019-11-17T01:22:53.589+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"The number of times I have been screwed over and also screwed someone else over because we were both going for the same strat is way too high, so I agree with the OP.  I have 4 Shadow, fighting someone with 4 Shadow, and neither one of us can get a single gold because we're rolling for the same champs.  It's too late for either of us to switch strats, so we got 6th-7th.  Compare that with other games where I run the same strat alone, and I get 1st??  That disparity shows how crippling it is to have even just one other person share your comp.\n\nWhat makes it worse is that the different elements give extra incentive for people to build that type, mostly due to Qiana.  If it's fire, 3-4 people run 6 Inferno and 1 assassin, and they all die with silvers and bronzes.  Mountain pops up, and everyone runs Tal + Qiana for the early bonus, and no one can upgrade their units.  If only 1 person is left to this strat, they dominate strongly and place in the top 2.\n\nThe main problem I see is the vast improvement from bronze to silver to gold.  If you don't invest in your build, you will surely die, but if you DO invest in your build, you can no longer adapt to what other people are building, and leave yourself open to counters.","replies":[{"poster":"CloudedLogic","date":"2019-11-17T05:13:46.673+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That is one thing, but given the hurdle of collecting 9 of a single champ it should be something decent. So if they reduce the stats (which I think are nearly doubling your hp and AD each time, and whatever scaling your special gets I guess) when you rank up it probably wouldn't be by too much. I think They need to add a few more champs to the game to reduce the consistency slightly, and at least revert the card changes.\n\nAs it is, the game feels like it rewards hitting five quickly and then slowing down to reroll for gold 1 and 2 cost units or going to the opposite extreme and trying to get one of the nuisance 4 or higher cost units (Olaf, zed/yorick, signed, and maybe lux).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Smyrage","date":"2019-11-16T23:19:52.141+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think that it's a big problem and it depends on the build again. In the previous set rerolling early game was a waste of money, because everyone rushed for Tier 4s and 5s. In the current set you should actually think about what to build, when to level and when to reroll. Basically if e.g there is no competition for Vladimir and Taliyah and you want mage build, you should be rerolling more early game. If your build involves champions, which e.g Mystic, then you should go for levels.","replies":[{"poster":"CloudedLogic","date":"2019-11-17T05:29:17.920+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel going for tier 4s (though not necessarily rushing them) should be the thing to do. They require an investment to reach, thus they should have some kind of pay off, but as the game is, getting gold champions is only outweighed by the most egregious of higher cost champions (Olaf with his ignore cc ult and stupid synergies, zed with is mass cloning, etc), and the only trade off you are making is delaying your level up to try and maximize your chances of seeing multiple copies.\n\nA good example would probably be comparing Gold Syndra to Silver Brand. A gold Syndra according to the https://tftactics.gg/ has roughly 40% more hp, and dps than a silver brand if my math is right.","replies":[]}]}]}
