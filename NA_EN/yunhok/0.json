But here's the problem about it. I Accept the match and then nothing loads....\"okay i guess its taking its time for now\" until i get a 6 min timer... \"okay?\"\nSo shake that off and wait my 6 mins to que up again and once again I press accept and wait. It doesn't load for the second time and with that IT ENDS MY SOLO Q SERIES AND TAKES AWAY MY LP. RIOT THIS IS NOT OKAY I AM PISSED AT THE FACT THIS HAS HAPPENED TO ME, AN UTTER DISAPPOINTMENT. HOW? JUST HOW COULD YOU DO SOME CRAP LIKE THAT. Im just asking that you guys can do something about it.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-12-12T17:38:20.709+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That sounds incredibly frustrating.  :(  I looked into this for you and it looks like you had two [queue dodges](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751844-Queue-Dodging) in a row which escalated to a 10 LP loss.  It sounds like your network is really struggling to transition you from matchmaking into champion select, so it's leaving you behind while everyone else is pick/banning.  \n\nI don't recommend queueing up for anymore games until this is fixed!  Your best bet may be to run through each step of the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to troubleshoot, but test it in custom games for now.","replies":[]},{"poster":"bellabella3211","date":"2017-12-12T21:12:03.372+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same happened to me and I got a warning. It just kept loading and then it stopped and it said ''recconect'' so I did but it happend again and again. I don't know if I dare to start a new game. I'm to scared to get banned and I'm very new with this, I have only played a few times.","replies":[]}]}
