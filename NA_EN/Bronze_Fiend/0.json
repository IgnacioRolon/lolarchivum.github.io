I can sum all of them like that : Search @ software manager for \"playonlinux\", install it. Search league of legends @ playonlinux, follow the instructions of the install wizard, voila. SOME of them actually list the requirement of some directx libraries for playonlinux but not how to install them actually ( probably this is why i can't run lol at all. ). I've searched for some tutorials on how to install directx on linux but i really can't figure it out.\n\nI installed playonlinux, downloaded league of legends, but when i start it, i get a bug splat, just after the league of legends splash art prior to launcher. I never got to see the launcher on linux actually. \n\nTried both linux mint and ubuntu ( latest versions available ).\n\nBy the way, it's 2016. Why lol is not supported on linux already ?","replies":[{"poster":"Bronze Fiend","date":"2016-07-29T05:07:45.662+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, there surely are some players who are playing from linux.

We currently provide support for PC and Mac, but don't have visibility on Linux or why it's this way.  You may be able to get some help from the Linux community to help troubleshoot this, otherwise I could only recommend playing from a supported OS.  Best of luck!","replies":[]}]}
