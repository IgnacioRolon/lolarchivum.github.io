I have 1717 IP and the store says I do not have enough IP to buy a 1700 IP mystery champion shard.  A rioter had to tweak my account last time to fix this.  I already re-logged.  Please correct my IP value so I can purchase in the store based on the 1717 IP amount the client shows I have.  Thanks","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-21T00:45:51.797+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you on the updated client?  Your balance is likely out of sync but returning to the legacy should fix it up:\n\n-  On the login screen of the open beta updated client, look for the \"Launch Legacy Client\" text at the bottom.\n-  Or create a shortcut directly to the legacy client in your League Installation. Just look for \"lol.launcher\" \n\nLet me know if that helps!","replies":[]}]}
