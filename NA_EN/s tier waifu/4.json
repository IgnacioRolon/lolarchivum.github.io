Now that Jungle is that way, the game has never felt worse, in conjunction with damage being way too high and CC remaining unchanged / growing with every new champion created.","replies":[{"poster":"IVSakenz","date":"2020-01-02T18:28:41.331+0000","up_votes":20,"down_votes":0,"body":"Jungle has always had a pretty big impact on the game.. what the new jungle has created is a situation where one teams jungler is going to be useless..and causes an almost auto loss because they have no way to catch up and have any impact at all after they make their first mistake..","replies":[{"poster":"S Tier Waifu","date":"2020-01-02T18:30:10.963+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=IVSakenz,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=w9GNuqFp,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2020-01-02T18:28:41.331+0000)\n>\n> Jungle has always had a pretty big impact on the game.. what the new jungle has created is a situation where one teams jungler is going to be useless..and causes an almost auto loss because they have no way to catch up and have any impact at all after they make their first mistake..\n\nExactly, so if you're on the team with the autofilled jungler, the one that isn't as good, doesn't make a good jungle pick, or doesn't get olaf / lee sin / eve it seems like you just lose now.

Now that Jungle is that way, the game has never felt worse, in conjunction with damage being way too high and CC remaining unchanged / growing with every new champion created.\n\nIt's nothing to do with autofills, stop looking for scapegoats.\n\nJungle is right now the only role without any way to catch up the moment it's put behind, and often being put behind comes down to two factors: you can't duel the enemy jungler because their champ is a stronger duelist than you and can invade you, or your lanes don't give you priority for scuttles and objectives or feed the enemy jungle kills by overextending without vision while you're in the other side of the map.\n\nImagine playing Annie vs. Xerath, except there are no turrets. That's how jungle is, because the enemy jungler that's put ahead can come invade you 24/7 and take your only form of XP, and so can enemy laners who you can no longer duel because even the enemy bot lane is the same or one level above you while the other lanes are 2-3 levels over you after your first clear.\n\nYou are a second worse support now that lives and dies by being able to get a successful gank at lv2-3 because by lv3 is the last time you'll be around the same level as enemy laners. By the time you get lv5 top lane will be lv7. Mid lane will be close to that as well. \n\nAnd unlike support, you not only are giving your item slot for a jungle item like they are for their support item, you are giving up a summoner spell as well. You are objectively weaker than anyone but a support, and even some supports like Brand or Fiddlesticks can 1v1 you as something like an Evelynn jungle.\n\nAs a jungler you no longer have agency and the capacity to get ahead and duel out enemy lanes to re-establish priority in any lane or river. If your laners aren't winning lane on their own, you are not going to be able to do anything either.\n\nI started a game where I got my Tristana 3 early kills as Evelynn against the enemy Ezreal and Malphite. Didn't matter, she took my kills and did nothing with them, as by midgame the malphite and ezreal played the sieging game, ezreal got his manamune and started poking people for half their health over walls, and malphite ulted whatever got on the fed enemy Syndra and won pretty much every teamfight that way.\n\nPoint is, you can even get your lanes kills, and end up with nothing because in the end the quality of the laning players is the only thing that matters.\n\nAnother game I played Shaco/MF, with me as shaco autofilled support. The enemy Lee Sin was 4/1 by minute 5, didn't matter because as shaco I got my MF 2 kills for her and 2 kills for me on the enemy Nami. Lee Sin comes in for a gank, I simply ignite him and QE him without him even landing on one of my boxes and the MF runs him down in melee range before he can burst her down with a landed Q combo.\n\nThat's how jungle currently is, where you can get fed and at best while fed be even in levels with enemy laners but still weaker than a fed laner. Lanes matter more than jungle, and the only reason jungle exists is to smite dragons if allowed the priority over objectives by his lanes.\n\nYou HAVE to play some busted early snowball champ like Rengar, Olaf, Rek'sai, or Lee Sin to play the game now, and even then it's no guarantee and regardless you fall off hard by lv10 compared to enemy lanes. The job of the jungler now more than ever is to make sure winning lanes snowball even harder before 10 so you can comfortably take dragons and baron.\n\nWatch a rcent game with TF Blade where tyhe enemy Ekko jungle has 9/1 and is lv14 while TF's Vayne top is lv15 with 7/5 KDA and is able to kill a fed ekko jg thanks to the xp jungle changes. If an Ekko jg before the jungle nerfs were 9/1, he would easily be lv16 by that point, not 14.","replies":[{"poster":"2gudaiya","date":"2020-01-03T08:55:15.250+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Crescent Dusk,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=w9GNuqFp,comment-id=0006,timestamp=2020-01-03T02:03:36.264+0000)\n>\n> It's nothing to do with autofills, stop looking for scapegoats.\n> \n> Jungle is right now the only role without any way to catch up the moment it's put behind, and often being put behind comes down to two factors: you can't duel the enemy jungler because their champ is a stronger duelist than you and can invade you, or your lanes don't give you priority for scuttles and objectives or feed the enemy jungle kills by overextending without vision while you're in the other side of the map.\n> \n> Imagine playing Annie vs. Xerath, except there are no turrets.

What easy?? Yes easy af don’t have to last hit, don’t have to constantly fight another player just to get to try to last hit, don’t have to also watch mini map constantly for fear of ganks while last hitting , you get to pick almost every fight and almost every fight is in your favor hence why they are called ganks it’s always been the most easy role and it’s also always been the most influential role. I mean junglers actually pretend they do this amazing thing “objective control” wtf is that even lol you mean picking a character that kills the dragon and 1 rift easily solo you literally feel like you are making big plays killing a dragon every 5 minutes ???
