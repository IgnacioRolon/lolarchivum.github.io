And it sounds like it might be the fault of the jungler. Either way, what I usually do is offer to then immediately leash red. It usually helps to calm the jungler down and let them know it was unintentional. I'll do this even if it sets my lane back.\n\n(on the off-chance you also subsequently steal red, well... I've got nothing for you LOL)\n\nAs far as punishment being harsher, I think the punishment system is right where it needs to be. The 'detection system', on the other hand, could be better. People who intentionally feed often go multiple games until they are reported/detected/discovered. Yet, I don't have a solution, and until someone finds a better method to what exists I'm don't forsee this changing.\n\nAs for their flame, I presume you didn't flame back and reported them after the game for verbal abuse and for griefing/inting. Being specific in your reports is always a good idea, on the off chance that said report gets reviewed by a flesh and blood human being. Also, remember you don't have to deal with their verbal toxicity - you can mute the offending players, or the entire board if necessary.\n\nFinally, if you did nothign wrong you have nothing to worry about from multiple reports. It doesn't matter if you are reported by 1 or 9 players, if you didn't break any behavioral rules during the match it won't count against you.\n\nGood luck man, don't let the jerks get to you.

The toxicity score returned from the review will be the same regardless of how many times a player was reported within the same game,  1 report does the same thing as 9 reports. It is also possible for the system to return a toxicity score of 0 if there was no toxicity found within the game. \n\nSo no need to worry about others reporting you for no reason. Infact, it counts against them as they harassed you, and plenty of people have been punished for calling for reports. When people call for me to be reported, I just laugh at them, but feel pity for them at the same time, cos I know they'll eventually get punished for it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nightsky Pirate","date":"2020-01-08T02:37:29.190+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I have considered this. A lot, and repeatedly. There are problems with harsher punishments.\n\n1. Banning is as harsh as they can get without scaring a lot of fair-minded folks away. I'm talking actions that are meant to stop folks from simply making as many accounts as they please and ignoring the rules. The required actions could start a sort of an online war, and nobody but the most zealous white knights want that.\n2. There are plenty of folks who reform before they are banned. The current system is based on progressive, less lenient punishments, starting with a slap on the wrist. Like a warning, as is appropriate. Not everybody comes into the Rift with an understanding of what decent chatting behavior is.\n3. Some have reasonably said as many as 15% of players get banned as is, even if it's only 2%, that's too many. We don't actually have any solid evidence of how many are getting banned, but my own most earnest estimation is about 4%. The solution is not banning *more* players, but the *right* ones.\n4. Incurring faster, harsher punishments will encourage more of the behavior circumventing the system. Buying League of Legends accounts is already a high-ranking market in terms of frequency, due to the relatively low cost. Enacting faster bans will likely strengthen this market, making 1) an even more dangerous idea.\n5. Individuals have bad games, so do you. You are not the arbitrator of who should be punished. Only players with repeated offenses of the same sort within a narrow enough window of time are punished, not counting extreme cases.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tele II","date":"2020-01-09T00:55:50.343+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol ive done that before.

Its a deep psychological thing. But perhaps im wrong. Like I said, it was just my honest thoughts about it, not like I'm stuck on it being the truth. \n\nYes I know its frustrating. But assuming they dont get punished probably only increases your frustration, so that kinda fits into the whole wanting to be a victim concept. Like, if they were just subtley trolling, then yeah, your assumption would have some credit. But they flamed you for 30 minutes, which is SO easily detected and SO often punished. So its like you WANT to think they didnt get punished, even though history would suggest they will get punished. Thats why I identified a victim mentality. \n\nBut yes, trolling sucks.
