Tell that Proactive news to TSM  in their game vs TL... They played a reactive team comp versus a heavy, EXTREMELY heavy engage from TL. \n\nThough, I will admit Cassio is the queen of Counter-Engage.

For a team to do well internationally diversity with confidence is needed. Always on Constant Aggression dies out to Turtles (not wild ones). Late-game dedication gets nuked by early-mid comps.\n\nWhile I agree that TSM is more comfortable on proactive engage heavy teams, they still lack the diversity to react to changes in enemy strategy mid pick/ban which has always been a weakness for them.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"B00B00","date":"2015-02-23T19:43:29.814+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well, i do think EU is more interesting to watch than NA more action seems to happen.\n\nnow to stem that argument for a second, i do think both regions are pretty equal, i am not starting an eu vs na debate the above is just my opinion on watching games.\n\nLCK is quite intersting to watch most times and LPL is exciting atm.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rhlax","date":"2015-02-23T14:46:42.292+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I watched Saturday's NALCS with a friend.
