Do you have any plans for him? Honestly I&#039;m not even looking for a &quot;yes we&#039;re buffing him&quot;, it&#039;s just I haven&#039;t heard ANYTHING about him and was wondering if there&#039;s anything you&#039;d be willing to talk about. \r\n\r\nOh, and is there a specific Rioter responsible for Karthus? I wanna know who my favorite is. Although I don&#039;t ever think I&#039;ll love any Rioter more than Rhojin. \r\n\r\nI DIGRESS!

With zero mobility no hops dashes or flashes ect wouldnt the benefit be a little extra power elsewhere? I personally think hes average since you can dodge the Q and there are several ways to dodge the R also. Someone was talking about trying to balance the mobility creep for the champs with none. Wouldnt Karthus be a good example of a non-mobile champ with good dmg but that can be negated by his enemies?","replies":[]},{"poster":"BestKarthusEU","date":"2016-06-15T10:23:30.292+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Meddler,\n\nThanks for the reply.
