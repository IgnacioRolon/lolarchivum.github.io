Typically the connection between your computer and your router will be pretty good? Your ping spike issues could be caused by any of the other entities in between you and the server.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Riot BlueMonday","date":"2020-02-24T20:28:47.990+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Didn't understand a single thing u said.\n\nDamn. Ok, attempt 2:\n\nping is a tool that measures how long it takes to send a network message to a device and receive a response. When you ping your router you are measuring how long it takes for a network message to go from your computer to your router and back. \n\nLeague of Legends servers are located in physical buildings across the world. For example for EUW/EUNE servers are located in a building in the Netherlands.\n\nWhen you perform an action in the game, a message gets sent from your computer to the server in the Netherlands. The message goes from your computer, through your router, through the network devices of your internet service provider, through Riot Games network devices, and finally to the server. You are only testing the connection from your computer to your router but issues which result in ping spikes could be caused by some of the other devices along the way to the server.","replies":[]}]}
