Unfortunately, we lost the match and we were completely silent after, in disbelief that we lost to some bots. Pretty much afterwards we agreed that we would never talk about it again, and I then completely forgot about it until I saw this post.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Alzon","date":"2019-01-24T22:24:51.582+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Taric Bot, the Living Nightmare","replies":[]},{"poster":"Doge2020","date":"2019-01-24T18:43:45.092+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When I was still very new to the game, I played an intermediate bot game, after a lot of intro games tho lol.

The 3 I lost, 2 were really early, no idea what I was building. I think back then i thought more attack speed was needed as it meant I attack more so would get it on everyone. I also remember buying a bami cinder on Heimer as if anyone got near me they'd take damage. The last lost was because it was me, 1 other guy and 3 bots running down mid on Intermediate Bots.\n\nAlso, the Trinity Force thing, items do stack but not unique passives, so while you will still get the benefits of the basic stats the item gives (HP, damage, CDR etc), the 2 unique passives it has, will only happen once. Cho'Gath can legit if he wanted build more than 1 Warmongs ( {{item:3083}}  ), as his ult scales from bonus HP and it's a great source of it but he won't benefit from the healing passive it has twice.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MLDzXnRRR","date":"2019-01-24T07:20:37.537+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't get 2 trinity force.

And yeah, the game was questionable, our Riven came bot lane with me and kept trying to fight inside their tower's range before quitting the game for good. Our Poppy (level 20 btw) did nothing but tower rush top lane by herself with no help from minions, then did the same thing mid lane. I kid you not, she did nothing but run at a tower, smack it, and die. Our Warwick- well, I had no idea what he was doing. Out of all of them, I think our Morganna was the most helpful, she followed me to their base and helped hit the tower a few times before unfortunately dying.","replies":[{"poster":"MLDzXnRRR","date":"2019-01-25T10:01:45.974+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=WhatZeDuck,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=ajdrRQnU,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2019-01-24T22:17:13.109+0000)\n>\n\n> \n> I have no idea, I&#x27;m still learning items and the only one I really know by heart is Tri force.
