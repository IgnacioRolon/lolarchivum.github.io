Each time it occurs, I have to reinstall the game to get it to open. Once it's open, I can leave it open indefinitely without issue. I can access everything, play games, no problems. As soon as I have to reboot my computer for any reason or close and reload the app, it refuses to open. I double-click, it pops up in the task manager, and then closes without doing anything.\r\n\r\nAfter today's patch, reinstalling no longer works. I cannot access the game at all.","replies":[{"poster":"Mr Lewis","date":"2019-10-24T02:56:08.809+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So, I had a similar problem and this may or may not help, but what worked for me was to Disable/Enable my Gpus in the control panel. Since I have 2 Gpus, GTX and Intel, my client was opening on the \"Wrong\" Gpu (GTX instead of Intel) and my PC couldn't handle the client. As I said, my issue might have been a localised one, but if this speaks to you maybe you can give it a try.","replies":[{"poster":"Djahno","date":"2019-10-24T22:23:07.818+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the suggestion.
