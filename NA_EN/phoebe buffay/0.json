I pick my champ, the countdown is over and we are supposed to go loading screen but i never make it to there. Instead there is a box with \"League of Legends has stopped working\", and after I click \"okay\", an error appears like 0x00..05. Then I try to restart LoL, same thing happens when I want to reconnect. Then I try closing it in Task Manager and restart again and it still crashes and then my teammates remake because, well, I can't come to the game. Help, what should I do?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-03-23T23:18:16.068+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"With an error like this, and you only get the issue in about half the games you try playing, it sounds like it might be caused by some corrupted game file somewhere. When those matches try pulling on a game file it can't load, it would cause the game to crash since it can't read that file correctly.\n\nFollow the steps in our [Bug Splat Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974) to cover all your bases.
