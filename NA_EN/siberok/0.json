I really wanna play Zed right now {{champion:238}}","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-28T18:43:12.033+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's been a while since I've personally seen a blue screen of death, but when it happens there is usually a hardware problem.  There is a possibility of driver or setting issues causing this to happen, and I would recommend using our [game crash](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes+) to rule out any possibility.  If the issue persists, let me know as there might be hardware issues causing this.  I'll be around!","replies":[{"poster":"Siberok","date":"2016-09-28T19:30:32.134+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks Porocles for the link, I've checked it out and I've done practically everything there.\nI still continue to have the bluescreens anyway, and I've been suspecting it was hardware issues, considering i'm playing on a 2010 HP laptop XD\n\nBut, the one thing I wasn't able to do was update my graphics card, because AMD doesn't have drivers for it anymore for some particular reason. (They don't want me to play League because they know i'll feed hard)\n\nI'm guessing the reason is that my computer is supposed to be running Windows 7 instead of Windows 10, but I can't revert back to Windows 7, so I guess I kind of dug my own grave. I also just moved my RAM around just to see if that could fix the problems.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-28T20:16:14.621+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the follow-up!
