This forced everyone who would buy it to just buy warrior instead, and the ones who couldnt either went top or just didn&#039;t get played anymore. \n\nNow the same thing is happening with runeglaive, except its not because of junglers, its because of midlaners. Even worse, your gutting a champion alongside the gutting of the item.\n\nCan we get some insight on this? Would it not make more sense to do one or the other? I personally think removing the physical to magic conversion is bad either way, that&#039;s what makes the item viable. Sure, nerf the AoE, its just extra power tacked on, but the magic damage is important.","replies":[{"poster":"Yosuke Apperu","date":"2015-07-14T23:28:31.515+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The magic conversion is what is making rune glaive ezreal so broken.","replies":[{"poster":"HYPERBOLOCO","date":"2015-07-17T03:36:59.535+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think any Evelynn player has an issue with runeglaive no longer converting on hit spells into magic damage. We just don't understand why they are also reducing Q damage by 20. The double down is whats troubling us.","replies":[]}]}]}
