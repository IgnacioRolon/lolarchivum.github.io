The vast majority are fan skins, jokes, funny threads, and some \"how to deal with (insert token problem here)\".

No exceptions. Wether those champions are indeed in need of nerfs/tweeks or not is a subject to disguss but not worthy enough to take up my time when I could be getting updated on Fiora and Yorick's reworks(they both got benched because bigger projects are of importance), the misserable state of the lore and more. \nI don't need Meddler telling me the state of Nidalee is extremely powerfull but because the meta swifted to tank junglers she might fall off again, no, fucking nerf her and everything's gonna be allright. Time wasted where you could've spent making a proper fucking rework for Kassadin, a Zac skin, Zed tweaks etc etc.\nI want to be involved when my favorite champions get a skin, instead of waiting for it to be served on a plate, I want to be involved when my favorite champion gets their lore changed, not stand back when they get a misserable 2-liner and then cry in a corner. Instead I'm having the game dictated by some retards obsessed with the meta-game and their nerd-culture that is LCS -_did TSM wonnered?_-. \nI'm just going to stand back and watch as yet another thing I love gets ruined for the sake of the playerbase, that playerbase than all it does is cry in the boards. Because what makes my opinion more important/special than whomever idiot's got topvoted for their \"nidalee OP plz nerf\" thread for the 110th time? \nNot to mention that every time they fuck things up they completely ignore the Boards, then come after a while being all like \"it was our fault we didn't communicate enough\" and \"we believe _X_ thing is in an _X_ state right now be we could've conveyed our plans better\" At this state of the game I wouldn't be surprise they come up with a Tribunal hold-up and then start apologizing they could've kept us updated better but they didn't, and then move on with their lives LIKE EVERY SINGLE TIME SO FAR. \n\nPJsalt","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"LegendmakerGX","date":"2015-05-02T00:29:58.749+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"I agree riot never talks about the bugs/OP champ opinions/Afk,Feeder in rank.
