(DISCLAIMER as always, this kit will almost definitely change before we ship. It's not been in actual production yet--that is to say we've not tested it with custom animations, models, particle effects, sounds and so on.","url":"http://www.reignofgaming.net/news/27965-updated-warwicks-rework-full-kit-preview","image":"http://i3.ytimg.com/vi/XHVayOPfhMg/hqdefault.jpg"},"up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Warwick not being on the \"To Do List\" for this year is kinda concerning.\n\nI mean, from what I understand, you already have the kit finished. All you need are numbers and Visuals. Whats up?\n\n-Poppy\n-Ryze\n-Fiora\n-Gangplank\n-Taric\n-Urgot \n\nIs there anyone who you could cross off of that list so Warwick can be a champion again? The kit you guys showed us a while ago looked amazing, and current warwick is kinda just... \"I clicked R and W. I hope I helped!\"\n\nThis might just be my opinion, but do you think you could take Urgot off of the rework list now? That mana shield buff was all he really needed, and his kit isnt exactly \"toxic\" or \"unfun\". He has counterplay, he was weaknesss. Why not put warwick ahead of him?\n\nIf anyone is wondering what I am talking about, I attatched a link to the rework preview released in April of 2014.\n\nEdit: A comment made in may of last year by ZenonTheStoic:\n\n\"Hi! We have a strong direction on a Warwick kit--he's totally playable and tracking very well internally. However, the kit changes enough that we cannot ship it without new art: new animations, new particle effects, and new sounds. At this point we would be 90% to remaking the champion, and he really needs it. So the new Warwick kit will ship whenever we have the time to give Warwick a full visual update. I would hope that's some time late this year, but no promises.\"\n\nWhats going on riot?","replies":[{"poster":"Onwodori","date":"2015-04-04T02:36:48.349+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://img1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20141108225113/freddy-fazbears-pizza/images/3/3d/Foxy_Running_Gif.gif\n\nReworked Warwick Ult","replies":[]}]}
