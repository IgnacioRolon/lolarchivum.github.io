Problem solved.  You can't nerf mana AND remove what was essentially a damage amplifier for mages.... then not touch mana-less assassins like Zed and Yasuo, followed by releasing more non-mana champions.  It's as if they're planning to slowly eliminate mana from the game.  Not sure if I should be expecting reworks for this or if mana champs are just dead to Riot right now... who knows.\n\nAs for Morde... he can be pretty strong with the right team, but has to snowball it seems.  I could be wrong, but he seems like he has a slow start but can pick up and snowball quick if he gets the chance, esp. with that shield of his.
