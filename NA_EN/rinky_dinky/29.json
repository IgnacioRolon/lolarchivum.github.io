Sona is in a good spot right now. She brings a good amount of utility and damage to her team. She is a great poke supp, and synergizes very well with poke comps.\r\n\r\nHowever, she is the squishiest champion in the game atm, or at least in the bottom 5. With no runes or masteries, she has less health than a melee minion.  On top of that, she is very low range. She has to be very close to all of her teammates to get 100% effectiveness out of her abilities, and is very, very easy to pop in teamfights or skirmishes.\r\n\r\nRiot's nerfs last patch were unjustified, and this only makes it worse, both literally and figuratively. \r\n\r\nNow, to me, the thing that stands out to me about Sona is her Q. I love it. It can be used as long range poke, or, a hard engage nuke. The original cast is pretty weak, but can hit 2 targets at 700 range. However, if she gets in auto range, this can be combined with her passive, dealing quite a bit of damage. This can be very very risky however, as anyone with a brain will jump on you, and you will die. If you go for the passive poke at the wrong time, you will get 1-shotted. This is even more true against supports like Zyra, Leona, Thresh, and Blitz, as the will laugh as you get 100 - 0 with their abilities alone.\r\n\r\nNow, the reason I am writing this is because they want to Nerf Sona's passive Q powercord. The nerf? 50% of powercord damage reduced to 40%. Stack that on with last patch's nerfs, and this is a serious problem. \r\n\r\nThe thing that bothers me even more is that at the same time, Elise and Hecarim are geting buffed. Now, dont get me wrong, I think these champs need a buff, but they are already seeing lcs play. Guess who has not seen a single game this year? (Correct me if im wrong), Sona.\r\n\r\nNow to me, Nerfing a non-competitive pick, and buffing already dominant competitive picks sends some very strong messages that really just say, and I quote \"Ma Esports\". The best part is, I never see anyone say \"Damn that Sona was OP\". You guys just keep nerfing her. Over and Over again. \r\n\r\nHer scalings arent good, her heal is mediocre, and her speed-boost is non existent early game. She has to consistently put herself in danger to be effective, and, praise the sun, she actually gets huge rewards for being played properly! I don't see the problem Riot has with Sona, but she needs to be left alone. It is okay for a supp other than Thresh and Janna to be played, I promise!\r\n\r\nI demand justice. A symphony of justice, for our fare Maiden of the Strings. I call out to you, my fellow Sona enthusiests, re-direct your pitchforks from the rework, and let us try to salvage what remains.","replies":[{"poster":"MAZZ1M0","date":"2014-12-16T05:02:58.296+0000","up_votes":26,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm *so* f#$%ing tired of these nerfs.

Riot hasn't answered a question regarding Sona is almost 2 months now. Seriously Riot, wtf is the deal? Yes, I'm angry. No I'm not apologizing.\n\nI really agree with you, the only benefit she currently has for her team, is basically throwing her ult into the fray and hoping the other person doesn't get out of the stun duration and 1-shot her/rest of the enemy team kills her AND her ADC because they decided to go for the jungler who they caught in a bush and wanted a free kill.\nI love Sona so much. She was the 3rd champ I bought, I believe, and I liked her before the rework, I like her now, but I don't like how I can't do anything because of how I need to get into the range of dying because I needed to AA off my passive.\nRiot needs to have the passive have extended range for JUST the passive AA, then go back to the standard AA range, that way you can be safe against overpicked supports like Blitz, Thresh, Nami, Janna, Zyra, Braum, Morgana, just because they add more to the plate and can actually get a win for the lane.\nSona is too squishy. I made a post about this earlier, basically just asking for a build, but after playing as Lulu, Syndra, Lissandra, Annie, Janna, I can see why (well, 3 of those) they are picked as supports as opposed to picking supports that I enjoy because I LIKE THEM, not because they are strong as F (though I picked the other characters as supports BECAUSE of the fact that I didn't need many items to gain strength, and I like playing as them.).\nSona either needs a mana and health increase, decrease in mana costs, increase in mana/health regen, SOMETHING!!!

Unless the good spot is being one-shotted by a Blitzcrank or a Zyra, because they have snares/stuns that aren't on a 120 second cooldown.\nI honestly wasn't expecting the rework for Sona, because I thought she was pretty good where she was back in Season 3. Heck, I was able to kill a fleeing Yi with my Q's beam, while our Yi was chasing him, and I caused the enemy Yi to rage quit(that was honestly the best game, just because of that).\nIt was either the fact that when you are around level 10-15, people get caught out easier and aren't as aware as their surroundings, but I do believe Sona, our beautiful maven of the strings, needs to STOP BEING NERFED!!!\nI hate being flamed at because I picked Sona due to me saying, \"Hey Sona, I haven't played as you for a while. I'm gonna play a match as you, for old times sake.\", and then I underestimate MY damage as well as how much damage THE OTHER SUPPORT puts on me, not to mention that the heal+shield is just a waste of mana, as is using any of her other spells, because they do nothing until she gets the extra bonuses from her ultimate.\nWe need to start a petition and get the buff train rolling. There are too many Sona enthusiasts who want buffs, and there is no one saying \"nay\", BECAUSE THERE'S NO POINT IN SAYING \"NAY\"!!! RIOT'S ALREADY SAYING \"NAY\" FOR US!!!!\n\nP.S. Sorry for the long rant, but I really want to play as Sona without having to back after walking too far out just to give some poke or to throw my passive AA and get another one going.\nGASP! I just thought of something! You should be able to STACK her passive AA, making the AA stronger the more passive AA you get, obviously stopping at a stack of 3, because that's the number of basic spells at her disposal.\nJust a thought.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"FatesDefiler","date":"2014-12-16T08:22:15.140+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":1,"body":"could anyone saying 'sona is an oppressive lane bully' please take the time to play a game as sona support, then play as lissandra support in the next game and report back to this thread your findings.","replies":[{"poster":"Seviang","date":"2014-12-16T08:47:17.926+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":7,"body":"I play Sona support a lot and she does awesome damage with her q power chord at every stage of the game.

If you keep poking her, she'll can heal it with the passive of the relic shield, since Sonas W isn't healing that much with one or two points.\nAnd I wasn't talking about the late game, I was talking about laning phase/pre lvl 6.\nYeah, Sona can keep poking, but don't forget that Leona can do her healing for free, if she uses the passive wisely. Sonas heal costs quite alot of mana as well, so if I would play against an enemy sona, and know that she's oom, she'll be pretty worthless if Leona tries a engage.","replies":[{"poster":"cshakes","date":"2014-12-16T19:51:35.802+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":8,"body":"In my experience, Sona's healing is much, much more powerful than Relic Shield since *it increases based on how much health the target is missing*.
