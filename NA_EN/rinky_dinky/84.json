Zilean does all of the things i listed, and the way they interact in the game isnt fun to play against. \n\nI explained why Zilean was strong - possibly even to strong - in his specific role of support. All you did was \"Lulznope nub\". Welp, if all you want are sheep to kiss your ass and agree with you, ya should probably go join up with Amy's Baking Company.\n\nFact is, in actual play, Zilean is extremely difficult to lane against if he is in a duo lane. His intense zoning and good harass lets him push enemy champions away in the early phase, whilst his spammable speed buffs and long stun allow him to escape easily after being caught out. \nHis low cost bombs being both very damaging AND on relatively low CDs makes his harass game very strong. And he can just toss bombs out and hope you walk over them because they stay around for something like 5 seconds.","replies":[{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2015-05-24T15:03:50.896+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=DisasterSola,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=fqQEEL53,comment-id=00000000000000000000,timestamp=2015-05-24T14:12:57.041+0000)\n>\n> Cute. \n> Difference is...

Zero reason to pick him over the likes of Sona, Nami, Soraka, Lulu, etc. Gangplank support offers more reliability than Zillean. \n\nHis mid laning is slightly better than his supporting (Which is sad in itself), but is still awful due to how easy he is to shove in and bully early game.

He has no place in this game. He has zero reliability due to his bombs randomly locking onto minions instead of champions, and even if you land the first one, the second one will simply lock onto someone standing next to your initial target. And, once again, even if you do manage to set up a stun, you are probably dead.\n\nYou are forced to go into E range to even have a chance of double bombing, and while you do that, your enemy will simply kill you. \"oh but my ult'\".

They nerfed his ult, passive, his Q's damage and reliability, auto range, armor, and some even say nerfed his E.\n\nHe sits at the lowest pickrate in the game. 0.17%.\n\nOn paper sure, he looks amazing.
