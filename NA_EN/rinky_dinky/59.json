But far fewer can be good at it. Teemo isn't a good jungler, it's just vaguely possible for him to take the role. It's still a troll pick though.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Poptart Evelynn","date":"2015-04-02T16:59:49.597+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lmao what did I start :D","replies":[{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2015-04-02T17:38:58.864+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You paved the way for the future of cap'n teemo","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"itsWind","date":"2015-04-02T00:02:32.456+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"i think we have enough awful squishy non-cc jungles as it is, thx.","replies":[{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2015-04-02T00:50:36.928+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Because nidalee and Shyvana are just such AWFUL junglers, amiright?\n\nKappa","replies":[]},{"poster":"Abyssphere","date":"2015-04-02T16:57:38.070+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=itsWind,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=3LeKyRWx,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2015-04-02T00:02:32.456+0000)\n>\n> i think we have enough awful squishy non-cc jungles as it is, thx.\n\nWhat's wrong with a jungler being squishy and without CC?
