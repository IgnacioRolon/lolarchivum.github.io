Even if we assume that Koreans are genetically better at videogames, a Korean Jarvan should be stronger than a Korean Olaf if they both knew what the other one does and used the counter patterns available. Like not trying to run in a way that gives him free axe resets. He should've just went down into the river and Olaf would either have to abandon his axe or take a pretty big detour.","replies":[{"poster":"J0HN C3N4","date":"2015-02-19T08:16:46.092+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not going to get into the reasons as to why Koreans tend to be better at videogames.
