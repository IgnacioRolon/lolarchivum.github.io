Sometimes the cross-hairs will be green. \n\nYou are enable to auto attack (unless using auto attack move) by clicking on enemy champions, monsters, or minions. You cannot move your screen via the minimap, or use the hotkeys with a mouse drag to ping. The bug will disappear inconsistently. Sometimes clicking on the minimap a few times will fix it. Other times moving the camera to the shop and double clicking on the shop keeper will fix it.\n\nFrom what I have red, Renekton also has this bug on his E. \n\nDunkmaster is the only skin in which Darius has this problem. \n\nThat's all I know ;-;","replies":[]},{"poster":"Thunderkeg","date":"2015-06-26T14:27:04.328+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot Exgeniar,realm=NA,application-id=LqLKtMpN,discussion-id=FUQAXexP,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-06-26T09:43:05.555+0000)\n>\n> What are your settings relating to casting?
