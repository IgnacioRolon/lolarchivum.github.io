Sorry but 15.24 extra health at level one is not going to help anything. That gets even worse until you hit level four, WHERE YOU HAVE LESS HEALTH THAN NOW.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is going to make her laning even worse than it is currently. Sona is god-awful in lane right now against 90% of the supp role. during levels 1-5. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAll you can do in most match up's is q farm with spellthiefs. You do negative damage and get 5 gold for it. She used to be able to move in, combo, and get out, but the movement speed nerf made that stupidly hard, and you have to hope the enemy supp cant land skillshots. You aint gonna be dodging.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe movement speed is being returned, but now she will be squishier when she is SUPPOSED to gain presence. Very counter productive. This scales awful \r\ninto lategame btw. The amount of health she loses compared to live is about 100 hp. That might not seem like alot, but that is the difference between that AOE you had to tank because you have to get into stupid ranges to help your teammates oneshotting you or not. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNow the mana changes are actually increasing her regens around level 4-5, this debatable a buff. Her first few levels are going to be even more Awful.\r\n\r\nThe Auto damage increase and Movement speed increase are the ONLY 100% buffs. One of which we already had, so it imo, does not count.\r\n\r\nThat is one, maybe two buffs counting the mana regen.\r\n\r\nThe nerfs to her hp are insane, and I really dont understand why you guys insist on Sona not being able to do her job.\r\n\r\n100 hp nerf to her lategame, so we can have 15 extra hp at level one? How is that fair?\r\n\r\nNow, I can only assume more changes are in the works, so I will not pass judgement on this yet. However, if this is it, then you guys will have continued to make Sona even worse, and will frankly have really disappointed me.\r\n\r\nThese alone will not fix her problems. I await the finished product, which SHOULD SHIP AT THE SAME TIME AS THESE CHANGES.\r\n\r\nIf not, then I can only wallow in pity for the gutting of my favorite champion.","replies":[{"poster":"PentaJump","date":"2015-01-29T19:43:01.986+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"She's getting more mana regen though.

Sona is losing 111 HP by lvl 18 with the extra 15 HP she gets at lvl 1 being negated by as soon as lvl 3. Mana regen is a mess but it's safe to assume that early lvls she will have less and late game she will have more. Which leaves her AD and MS and one of them is a revert of a last nerf so i'm not counting that one.

The mana regen \"buff\" is too little when it does start kicking in and to late when it does become marginally useful and her early game mana regen suffers so if anything it just pushes you to use even more of your runes and masteries to fit that gap of early mana regen you don't have. It's fine if you think this is a buff, but coming from someone who mains Sona i know this isn't one and doesn't even attempt to fix the issues and is just another means of punishing her early game even more while giving her a negligible (almost laughable) better late game in terms of power at the cost of her being even more vulnerable.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"TheGrandAlliance","date":"2015-01-30T00:32:19.313+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ZephyrDrake,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=APp0iKGP,comment-id=00090001,timestamp=2015-01-30T00:25:04.355+0000)\n>\n> you have to be a moron to think this is a buff in any way, the only thing i could say it's a minor buff is to her late game mana regen and that's only because of the way regen items work now days.
