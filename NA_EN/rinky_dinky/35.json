More risk to get good trades, his laning phase will be much harder and he'll stay as a lategame champion. No need to nerf everything before realizing the problem and then when they'll finally remove the interaction cause they ran out of ideas he'll suck.\n\nActually, make his Q count as a ranged autoattack. That way, Grasp will be divided by 2 (cf. tooltip) and Bandit will give 3 gold instead of 10. I think that'd be a really good idea. And revert the other nerfs.","replies":[{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2016-02-13T02:03:27.415+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with this. \n\nChange Q to ranged, possibly change barrels to bonus pen, and if that doesn't work, THEN look at his gold gain. Gutting his ability to use barrels in teamfights, AND his gold gain at the same time is a really bad idea. It doesn't matter if his barrels ignore total armor if he cant use them anymore.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Gigahappytown","date":"2016-02-13T00:15:59.589+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Chaning his e to  bonus armor pen wouldn't do anything.","replies":[{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2016-02-13T01:58:39.062+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is a pretty bad argument. \n\nFirst off, you didnt provide any points to back up your claim.

Less gold means slower powerspikes. Slower powerspikes can have very big impacts on certain champions. For example, GP relies on having a certain amount of items in order to clear waves with the barrels effectively. Reducing his gold gain is going to, by cause and effect, reduce his S.S farm, by delaying his ability to instaclear waves with barrels, which will effectively increase the amount of time it takes to purchase ult upgrades. \n\nOn top of this, his E is being nerfed in a way that also makes it very inefficient to even use barrels to farm waves, as now he can only hold 3 at a time. Top this off with no compensation, his barrels having a delay... etc.\n\nTake into account nerfing his gold gain, while nerfing his barrels at the same time, will also destroy his ability to come back in a game. GP is very weak in lane. He has bad trades with anyone who can all in him early, and many champs will reach powerspikes before him. These nerfs will seriously hurt his ability to come back in a game, which he needs in order to function. \n\nAll of these nerfs at once are far too much.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Erockandroll","date":"2016-02-12T23:52:04.436+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"His SS income, compared to his ult cost, shouldn't be any different, than it is now. So I don't see how it will affect his ult. (considering the damage against minions isn't changed, so he doesn't even affect his farm game.\n\nAs for his current build path, I'm guessing Riot has decided that he should Hyper carry, and is simply getting their too fast.
