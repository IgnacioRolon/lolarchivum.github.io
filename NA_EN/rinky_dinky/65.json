It's miserable. He Q's to you whenever a matchup is in his favor, he kicks you away farther than Tristana's ult when it isn't, and if your team ever catches him out, he will just wardhop over a wall, or to a champion and get a nifty shield.\n\nYou can tell a good LeeSin from a bad one just by what he is building.\n\nA bad LeeSin builds straight damage and tries to nuke with Q+R+Q.\n\nA good LeeSin builds {{item:3074}} {{item:2045}} and the rest straight tank and CDR and becomes an absolute bitch for your team to deal with, while still being able to duel effectively.\n\nHe does too much and is too strong at everything he can do. He is capable of doing well in top lane, a good LeeSin can dominate mid, he can be infuriating to deal with if he goes support because of his safeguard, true vision, and kick-away, and of course he is a top tier jungler who can farm for a very long time while still being the strongest counterjungler in the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Joe Dredd","date":"2015-02-19T05:19:10.080+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"lmao, Lee sin has a 45% win rate in diamond.
