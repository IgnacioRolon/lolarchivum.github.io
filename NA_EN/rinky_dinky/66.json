I know certain champions actually don't such as shaco for example I know it's viable to not take flash on a few others as well, but as an adc, even with an escape/dash you still need flash. The other day I was playing with a TP/Heal Jinx and she ended up dying to a gank, there wasn't much I could do, but all I was thinking was... \"If only you had flash...\" And flash would of most definitely saved her.","replies":[{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2015-07-05T19:20:18.251+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not even the no flash that killed me.\n\nShe said tp was in-case she died.\n\nShe died.
