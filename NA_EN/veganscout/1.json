Ultimate Hunter is good for, well, champions that rely on their ultimates. Relentless Runter is good for junglers and if you plan to roam, and Ingenious Hunter is good for supports (especially when combined with Zombie Ward) as well as mages and assassins that rely on item actives and do not need another Hunter rune more.\n\nIn fact, I pick a lot the Domination tree secondary just for the Hunter runes.\n\nThe other two non-keystone slots for runes are kinda meh, though.

And 4 of them are in the same column. Sorcery's A-tree diversity got cucked because Ultimate Hat was moved to Domination's C-tree while only getting Nimbus Cloak in compensation.","replies":[]}]}
