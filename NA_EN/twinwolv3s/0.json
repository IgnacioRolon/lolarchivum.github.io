Either the client will continuously crash upon opening or it will let me into it then crash. This has been happening for a few days and it isn't just one crash it will crash reload and keep crashing on a loop. I thought it got fixed yesterday as it let me into a lobby but then it wouldn't let me in the game and kept crashing and throwing up the bug support page. I have checked all the files as well as my connection and nothing is wrong there. I'm not to sure how to go about this or if there is even a way to fix it. Any help would be much appreciated!","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-06-04T02:58:27.553+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You ran the hextech repair tool?\n\nWhat are the error messages you get after a crash, and exactly when does it crash?
