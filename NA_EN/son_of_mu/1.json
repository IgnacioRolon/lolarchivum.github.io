I play Anivia a lot, and I pick her when the other team has a lot of derpy all-in champs that run at you and autoattack a lot and/or have a 3-hit passive.  Vi, Ekko, Shyvana, Yi, Xin, Warwick, etc.\r\n\r\nThere are not many mages with attack speed slows... if any at all, now?\r\n\r\nThe visual updates are appreciated but this specific nerf was uncalled for and I ask that there is consideration for not removing this.","replies":[{"poster":"Maximum Morde","date":"2016-04-20T16:11:36.601+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Son of Mu,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=4itbW6uw,comment-id=,timestamp=2016-04-20T16:08:19.108+0000)\n>\n>  Yi, .\n\nDidn't work on him anyway.","replies":[{"poster":"IronwallJackson","date":"2016-04-20T17:06:20.789+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For that matter, it also doesn't work on Vi, since she AA resets from her E and usually wants to burst you down rather than autoattacking.","replies":[]},{"poster":"FACE THE WlND","date":"2016-04-20T16:45:55.457+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Maximum Morde,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=4itbW6uw,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-04-20T16:11:36.601+0000)\n>\n> Didn&#x27;t work on him anyway.\n\nThis is true.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"San Jos√©","date":"2017-03-30T16:06:51.996+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bump.","replies":[]}]}
