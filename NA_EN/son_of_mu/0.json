To be clear, that is:\r\n- Press Q once, and the iceball passes through the enemy, causing damage.\r\n- Press Q again, and the iceball explodes, causing damage a second time.\r\n- Press E, ice spike is cast on them.\r\n\r\nThat should be three separate hits, right?  Yet it doesn&#039;t proc new Electrocute.  Similarly, letting somebody sit in your ult for multiple ticks, and then casting E on them should also proc Electrocute, but it doesn&#039;t.  Is this intentional?  If so, why?\r\n\r\nIf it&#039;s because now they must be separate abilities then where do you draw the line?  Would three consecutive Riven Q&#039;s not proc Electrocute because they&#039;re all part of &quot;one Q&quot;?  What about hitting somebody with multiple Taliyah rocks with one Q?  What about multiple hits from a Lucian ult?  Only counts at one hit?  That&#039;d be silly...  I think it&#039;d be easier to make it work like Thunderlords did.","replies":[{"poster":"Eedat","date":"2018-01-12T16:55:40.056+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Electrocute counts 3 separate abilities or attacks.

I can understand them wanting to make DoTs not proc it anymore, like Morgana's pool.  Malzahar's E never procced it for example, so I could at least understand not wanting to make any DoTs at all proc it.\n\n2. It would nice, however, if *visibly separate* hits (like separate Taliyah rock hits from her Q) count as separate hits, but I could understand their logic if they wanted to say, \"No that doesn't count either, because she only had to press Q one time.\"\n\n3. *However*, I feel like *at the very least*, if the move involves separate button presses (like Riven pressing Q three times to hit three times, or Anivia pressing Q twice to hit twice), then those should indeed count as separate hits.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Tenth Leper","date":"2018-01-12T16:54:56.803+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unlike Thunderlord's, multiple hits from one ability do not count separately for electrocute.","replies":[{"poster":"VeganScout","date":"2018-01-12T19:30:21.263+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Tenth Leper,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=2mMwx3Ia,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-01-12T16:54:56.803+0000)\n>\n> Unlike Thunderlord&#x27;s, multiple hits from one ability do not count separately for electrocute.\n\nExcept on kat","replies":[]}]}]}
