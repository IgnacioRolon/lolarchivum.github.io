Malzahar's build ludens echo, as it has 600 mana for whatever dumb reason. and ALSO gives an amazing passive + 20% CDR.\n\nmalzahar, which from what i remember, used to first buy mana crystal into tear so he would have enough mana, then buy rylai's + liandry's and finish with zhonyas and morellonomicon. now? he rushes luden's (his spell shield allows him to build squishier) and just pushes lane and roams. (to great effect even, for an immobile mage like him.)\n\nmana potions? gone. as where mana issues. strategic use of mana and CD's where a thing of the past, just spam as much as you can to win lane. corruption potion exists, so even REALLY mana-hungry champs like GP wont run out.\n\nnot only that, several reworks had happend: the best of them being Warwicks's who was basically visually updated and giving more couterplay, in exchange for power. irelia and akali on the other hand? not so much fair, more like overloaded to the max, this along with the gutting of Aatrox. (that current creature is not aatrox, its a riven who snuck in his skin.)\n\nin general the game was a mess compared to season 5. (for me at least) teamfights had devolved into spam-fests where aiming doesn't matter. tanks die in 2 seconds, adc's vanish in a show of flashiness of an errant support ability. mages are tanking better than tanks and are inflicting true damage to everyone whom isn't building MR (and those that do, get countered by void staff)\n\ngame go quicker than ever: gold is more abundant, herald exist to farm towers and forcibly end the laning phase. meta champs are so strong compared to non-meta ones that its not even funny.\n\nindeed, the current SR meta looks more like URF than ever, but in URF there is at least fun: everything problematic has had nerfs on healing, or specially tweaked CD's to prevent bollocks, natural tenacity to prevent a total chain-stun from 1 champ. or straight dmg nerfs to begin with.\n\nall in all, season 9 is just a follow up from season 8, just an even bigger disaster, some month or so ago riot posted their balance scheme: it was based on WR and ban rate alone. what?????\n\nhere's a quote from season 4 riot on balancing an (by those standard OP champ) and even admitting that using WR is a terrible idea.\n---------\nWe bet nobody saw this coming.\n\nWarwick's popularity (and subsequent insanity in the win rate department, even though we don't like using win rate as a statistic because it's loaded with so many other variables but let's not get into that) is a perfect storm of changes to preseason systems, the jungle, and the latent powers within his kit. We all know Warwick should be lowered a peg (or two. or five.), so we've decided to focus on Hunter's Call and Infinite Duress.\n\nWe're going to be monitoring Warwick heavily to see if we need to go harder, but we're confident this reduces his power enough that you might actually be able to compete with him in games. 60%. Never forget. Now let's not talk about win rates again (seriously though, win rates are a correlation of game health, not a cause).\n-------\nend quote. i think this paints a rather grim picture: riot REALLY needs to up the work at balance (and not band-aid fixes either) in order to fix this mess of a game.\n\nThat's all.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"ProfDrDeath","date":"2019-07-23T18:21:34.720+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":7,"body":"Source for those numbers?

It is perfectly normal if a champion that falls off hard in low elo and takes a lot of practice to master has a strong state in high elo where good players can utilize its strengths. It is no different from the early game champions vs late game champions debate. \nOtherwise how could you say there is balance in the game when braindead champions stomp low elo hard? Master Yi has 53.53% win rate in iron and similar in bronze. Is it not \"freelo\"? Which champion is worse for the ranking system: Riven, who has low win rate in low elo and you have to be a good player to climb with her; or Master Yi, who needs 0 skill to play with therefore every noob can climb with him easily and get to ranks where they don't belong? Tell me which is more unhealthy and against the global balance?\n\nSo many Garen otps come to these boards and cry about Riven being unbalanced. It is funny asf because they didn't cry that much when they played at low ranks and easily won with a braindead champion that needs 0 skill just like Yi. They didn't come and cry about how safe and op Garen is when they stomped Riven 10/10. However, after they reached the rank where skillful players can utilize Riven's potential they just got shit on. That is the point when they suddenly start to care about balance.\n\nIf someone climbs with a braindead champion which can be mastered in a week then shouldn't be surprised if that champion falls behind in higher ranks where good players can play hard champions  properly. That is actually fair and balanced even if they cry a river about it.\n\nBesides, Master Yi's win rate in bronze based on 96,523 matches while Riven's win rate in master+ based on 1,648 matches.

Orbwalking? Clipping the end of autos with movement commands or ability casts?\nUsing spells with flash? ETC. Auto q on Yasuo? That's an animation cancel. R Flash on illaoi? Animation canceling. Ahri auto and q. That's an animation cancel.  Last hitting? Loads of that there. \nProperly kiting, Every ability that doesn't have cast time. All auto attacks all proper spell rotations everything uses animation canceling in this game. Riven just has easily noticeable ones due to the nature of her kit. Go to the champ main reddit pages of every champ most of them you'll find the guides on animation canceling for that champ. Gnar has his e r animation cancels, cammille has a bunch. Leblanc a bunch. Even teemo with the auto q. Literally every champ. When you auto and the windup animation goes off and then the auto goes off and you use another command before the ending animation that comes after the auto finishes . That's an animation cancel. If you do it too soon, you cancel the auto. If you do it after the auto, you just cancel the ending animation.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"8Belthazor8","date":"2019-07-23T21:21:37.593+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":4,"body":"What I like the most is how trustworthy people and their opinion are.
