Can you provide some more details of the issue you're having?  For example, when is it happening exactly and where?  If you are receiving error messages, what is it saying?  Are you trying to open hextech crafting while in queue, or adjusting your masteries?  Anything can help!","replies":[{"poster":"AuraCon","date":"2016-08-06T22:07:43.091+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The same thing happened to me just now after the Champion select. I was in a champion select for my ranked game, and after the champion select, I was in a loading screen. While the players were loading up, I was sent back to my client, saying \"The game has crashed, Please try to reconnect to the game.\" I tried restarting the client several times and flushed my DNS. \n\nSo far, none of them seemed to work. I'm still trying to click the reconnect button with futile attempts. I don't want to get the afk warning as I am in a promotion series.\n\nI have sent the error report, but I do not know whose problem it is. I installed and played Warframe yesterday and haven't played League of Legends since then. But, since I saw this thread here, I am not sure if it is the problem with my computer or league client.\n\nThanks","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-06T22:43:28.355+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like something is causing your game to render improperly and making it crash.
