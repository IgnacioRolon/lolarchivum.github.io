Suffice to say that while this is incredibly rare, I have heard of this type of issue occurring in the past.  The best explanation I can give you regarding this issue is in regards to the relationship between our Game Servers and your computer.  \n\nEssentially, when you load into a game of League of Legends, the Game Servers sends requests to your computer to load certain assets and files (such as the specific champions chosen by the players).  This request also includes your computer to load the assets for Minions to be visible as well.  However, if you are attempting to reconnect during a connection spike, or while you are experiencing Packet Loss or Transient Outages (a temporary loss of all internet), then this request may have been \"forgotten\" by your computer, and it loads into the game without these assets.  \n\nTherefore, the best way to ensure that this issue does not occur in the future is to ensure that we resolve the Lag Spikes and Crashes that you have been experiencing.  To that end, I strongly recommend that you complete all of the steps in the following Knowledge Base Article regarding connectivity issues:\n\nhttps://support.leagueoflegends.com/entries/21696815\n\nIf you have completed these steps, but those damn minions still appear invisible randomly and you are still experiencing Lag Spikes, then please do not hesitate to let us know here in Player Support by submitting a new [Support Ticket](https://support.leagueoflegends.com/anonymous_requests/new)!
