It was the Horrowing Tree Ward skin. Not a big deal, I do not own the Horrowing Tree ward skin so using it was fun. I'm not sure how to recreate the bug, but through the course of that match i kept laying pink wards, playing around. Everytime it was the tree. \r\nIt was only in one match. \r\nAnyone else getting different ward skins they don't own?","replies":[{"poster":"SuperSaiyanAsh","date":"2015-01-21T05:08:20.503+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had this problem last night too, I have the gentlemen poro ward active right now but when I pink warded drag it placed the astronaut poro ward.","replies":[]},{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-01-20T22:48:55.495+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is a known issue and we're working on a fix!
