Btw english is not my nationality so dont kill be for spelling things wrong :)\r\n\r\nSo you may or may not know about amumu&#039;s passive. It&#039;s called &quot;Cursed Touch&quot; and what it does is that is auto attacks apply a debuff that reduces the enemy&#039;s magic resist by a flat amount for 3 seconds. It&#039;s a pretty underwelming ability just by that. It can help with his jungle clears by a little and nothing much. In team fights, sadly, he can only apply this to 1 person when he has 3 skills that are AoE. And the worst part his, there is another passive in the game that does what Cursed Touch does, but better! [Wich is Fiddle&#039;s passive (and honeslty its a bad passive too but that&#039;s another story)]\r\n\r\nAnd the reason why I am saying this it&#039;s because I have a simple concept for a new amumu passive that I would like to hear other people&#039;s opinion on:\r\n\r\nIt is called Friendship\r\n\r\nIn a range of about amumu&#039;s ult  (or slightly bigger), when an ally is near amumu, he would get 5% increased armor and mr (it would stack)\r\n\r\nThe number could be a bit too high, but I think this would make more sense on amumu than its current &quot;Non Existent&quot; passive, and it could also make him more viable","replies":[{"poster":"CrimsonCobra3","date":"2016-03-21T23:38:47.792+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's an interesting idea, but I would rename it \"Hope\" because Amumu doesn't have any friends.

Any drastic change to his passive would alter that.  It may not be the best thematically but the rest of his 4 abilities are all great thematically so it makes up for it.","replies":[{"poster":"MetaKaizer","date":"2016-03-21T18:53:11.430+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree that his other skills are good thematically but the passive seems a bit out of place imo","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ReaperSheeper","date":"2016-03-21T16:07:13.967+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thats almost exactly the same as wukongs passive","replies":[]}]}
