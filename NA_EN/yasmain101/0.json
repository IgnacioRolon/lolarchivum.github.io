I became weak and chose to fight toxicity with toxicity and now being very close to a ban i have completely reformed. Every game is very difficult for me because i get threats of false reporting on things like not chosing to teamfight without a clear win condition such as missing ad or ap carries , chosing to siege or control objectives over teamfights or surrending at 20 minutes because the enemy got very fed and out team comp  which would have snowballed amazingly if we got ahead somehow fell behind and the enemy had a late scaling team comp which got so fed early game that there is no way for us. \n\nNow one thing i absolutely try every game is that i do not blame my teammates and try to sound polite. Even if things get heated i would express by saying \" Honorable summoner , friend or i politely request you to come and help us siege or try and use these netural adjectives in my sentences\". Every time my dark side tries to overcome i remember that i cannot go through the trouble of acquiring all the champions again. This punishment in league has helped me become a calmer player over the course of last 2 months and helped me learn the fact that every player's skill is different and their learning curves are different.I do am scared of false report ban therefore i will make sure i am always polite to everyone as possible and mute toxic stimulating chats in game. Sometimes when things are heated even a conversation sounds toxic. Also, when i am not tilted i rarely lose games. \n\nI think league has done great in terms of fighting toxic behaviors and thank you for reminding this again.","replies":[{"poster":"Victorious Nasus","date":"2018-06-05T20:10:42.726+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Spirituality,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=bEIv4mZ7,comment-id=00040003,timestamp=2018-06-05T18:51:22.333+0000)\n>\n> Hello everyone,\n> I also have recieved a 14-day ban and it is totally my own fault.

Every game I am very polite and use terms like politely, friend, or even if our chances are minimal I say, sometimes people have bad games its okay to lose. \nHowever, yesterday the in-game notification prompted me for unsportsmanlike conduct. I do not even know what it was for, but i presume it was for a ranked game yesterday where enemy draven was 2-0. \n\nOur jg ganked and as maokai i initiated with W to start trading because i had ignite and suddenly enemy jg cc'ed our jg from the red side bush and Draven killed our bot lane Draven escaped with 20hp. \nI heard Miss fortune starting to use abusive words but i immediately muted her and did not write one word. My goal was to find our win condition and come back to the game, however, enemy mid laner was fed as well, i think Anivia was 7/1 within 15-20 mins. i tried my best to understand our win condition but their damage was too much.I had most KP with 69% and i think everyone gave their best. I placed 4 vision ward in 25 minute game and 20 normal wards. It was a normal ranked game where enemy got ahead they snowballed won, end of story. However, i was reported for the loss.\nI played positively, communicated with \"polite\" adjectives in my language, but it seems someone reported me at the end and i got an in-game notification.\nHowever, in the unlikely event if i get banned i can appeal to Riot but it is my own fault that i am in this situation because of past toxicity. I wish i could reset the honor and toxicity bar so i can continue with my reform. It is sad that people relate losing to reporting and abuse the system.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Ifneth","date":"2018-06-06T02:09:24.633+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"_An enemy has been slain._","replies":[]},{"poster":"deathgod5","date":"2018-06-05T11:49:55.775+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can be pretty scary sometimes man.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"YerroFever","date":"2018-06-05T13:26:44.678+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"People STILL haven't learned that they shouldn't try to lie on the forums...\n\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}}","replies":[{"poster":"Umbral Regent","date":"2018-06-05T13:30:26.274+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Well, technically speaking, he wasn't lying.
