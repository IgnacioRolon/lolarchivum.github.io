They are really OP and need an effective counter. I porpose that we make tyrndamere (my main - 1000+ games in silver 4) 1 shot always the ranged cha mpions.\r\n\r\nWhy is this fair? and balanced? because rtyndamere is not range he is melee so if u are not in you&#039;re ultimate ability you will die in 2 second to range champion before you get in range to hit them.\r\n\r\nPlease dear god riot please do this.","replies":[]}
