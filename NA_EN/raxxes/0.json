Post patch 5.7, when one holds the left mouse button and then presses the right mouse button **the ability goes off instead of canceling.** I have reproduced this consistently and have restored my key bindings and options to default and the problem persists.","replies":[{"poster":"CrabDust","date":"2015-04-08T21:36:18.090+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":3,"body":"Guys we are having trouble reproducing this on live.

To give you a test case I'd suggest using Ezreal, with normal cast settings (default) press Q, hold left mouse, then while holding left mouse press right mouse and you'll fire a mystic shot when the ability should have been cancelled. \n\nAs I said I can reproduce this same affect with any ability in which a target is selected or a skill shot is involved - as these all should allow the caster to cancel with a right click while holding left click. \n\nNote: I am not referring to when an ability is selected (blue indicators appear) and right click is pressed - this will cancel that segment of the ability casting process, however when an ability is selected (blue indicators appear) and left click is pressed and held, normally I would have the ability to right click to cancel the whole process.","replies":[{"poster":"Raxxes","date":"2015-04-08T22:36:31.031+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Edit: On further investigation: \n\nI know now why you are having trouble replicating this - \n\nThe issue occurs when I press in left click - press right click - and **without releasing right click** release left click\n - This action canceled abilities before 5.7\n\nchances are you cannot replicate this because you are testing this differently:\n- I gave the same directions I gave you to someone else - and they performed it by holding left click - then by simply **pressing _and_ releasing** right click while holding left click - the ability was canceled.","replies":[{"poster":"ToxicSinged","date":"2015-04-08T23:15:51.080+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"The issue occurs when I press in left click - press right click - and without releasing right click release left click\n- This action canceled abilities before 5.7\n\n----------\n\nbingo. that is a huge problem because i do that all the time to cancel spells","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Washed up Nami","date":"2015-04-09T15:39:33.678+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"The problem here is that ppl aren't being clear enough. This bug isn't only with normalcast, it also happens with smartcast with range indicator. I'll write what you had to do in order to cancel a cast until now and what do you have to do now.\n\nUp until now if you were to cancel any ability with right click you would have to just press rightclick WITHOUT releasing it. For me, for example, if i were to cast ahri's q and i wanted to aim with smartcast with range indicator, i would keep pressing q in order to aim. If i wanted to cancel the cast i would just press right click without releasing it and i could just stop pressing q as the cast would be canceled.\n\nRight now if you want to cancel an ability that you have casted but not yet fired you have to use rightclick and RELEASE it in order to cancel. With the same example as before, if i wanted to aim with ahris q and then cancel it with smartcast with range indicator, i would have to keep pressing q in order to aim, and, if i wanted to cancel it, i would have to click and release right click before releasing the q key.\n\nTL;DR: Before you could cancel casts by rightclicking WITHOUT releasing rightclik, right now you have to click and RELEASE right click in order for it to work; otherwise you start walking in the direction you are pressing rightclick, but the skill is still being casted (as you still see the range indicator).\n\nIts pretty simple to play arround it, you only have to make sure to release the right click button if you want to cancel, but in the heat of the battle muscle memory just leads you in the way you have been playing for years. I hope i was clear enough and that this gets a hotfix instead of having to wait for a whole patch cicle, otherwise playing for ppl with normalcast or smartcast with range indicator would be a pain.","replies":[{"poster":"Magnathar","date":"2015-04-10T15:52:29.201+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Wølƒgang,realm=EUW,application-id=LqLKtMpN,discussion-id=ztdTJiYj,comment-id=00010003,timestamp=2015-04-09T15:39:33.678+0000)\n>\n> The problem here is that ppl aren't being clear enough.

It also conflicts with customized controls.
