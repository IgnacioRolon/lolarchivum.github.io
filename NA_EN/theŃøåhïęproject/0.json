It's not my fault that I disconnected, if I argued with my parents to make the wifi more stable, they would just yell at me for \"only knowing how to game\". Rito pls ;-; This is super frustrating. Is there a way to tell riot that it's not actually my fault for dodging the queue?\r\n\r\nIt really sucks to be like it.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-05T05:01:04.142+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately, there's no way for the server to determine what exactly happened.
