Obviously it&#039;s unlikely that we&#039;ll ever actually see any of them (hence why they were cancelled) but I&#039;m honestly curious: if the community had the chance to revive just one scrapped character, who would it be and why? Obviously some scrapped champions have technically made it into the game by serving as influences for the current roster (Ao Shin for Aurelion Sol, Seth for Azir, etc.), but there are still a fair few that, to this cover, cover some unique ideas/achetypes that we don&#039;t really see in the game.\r\n\r\nAgain, this isn&#039;t meant to be a petition to revive characters who are obviously already dead or trying to cling to some hope that we can see them brought back in some form. It&#039;s more just my genuine curiosity who the player base would bring back if given the option to do so.","replies":[{"poster":"Chembaron Yamada","date":"2018-09-01T00:12:10.333+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"But... why didnt you include Husk in the poll?\nI want Husk or CeeCee. :(","replies":[]},{"poster":"Seer of Mind","date":"2018-09-01T02:03:00.546+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ao Shin","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ebonmaw Dragon","date":"2018-09-01T00:22:57.203+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Ao Shin.\n\n\nNo, Aurelion does not count.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GreenLore","date":"2018-09-03T00:17:07.808+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"My opinion on all of them:\n**Averdian: **The alien thematic kinda clashes with the rest of the game,but having someone with psi-powers is actually something that is still missing in the game and while I think that such an alien looking guy would stand out I do think that a targonian aspect from a different planet could be fitting for the game,though they'd need to look more fantasy-like for it to work(just look at some of Zoes original concept arts where she looked more like an Imp).\n\n**Gavid:**Honestly I don't see  a future for this guy,Zyra got already the whole plant-mage thematic down(and its even focused on plants with thorns like gavid) and Maokai/Ivern are both walking plant persons already.So if they would make Gavid,then they'd need to completely redo him with different plants and a different body shape to differentiate him from the others.\n**\nTabu:**A voodoo-themed mage would be really cool and I think that there is a lot of potential there,though riot would need to be careful to not offend anyone with stereotypes.\n\n**Eagle Rider:**If he was remade he would likely be a demacian raptor knight instead(assuming that he literally rides on the eagle) and would likely not even remotely resemble the original design.Though having 2 demacian bird champs would be kind of odd,so I doubt that he'd have a good chance.\n\n**Avasha:**Was pretty much turned into Riven and I don't think she has anything going for her that makes her stand out.If anything they might just reuse her name for an unrelated champ\n\n**Omen:**Looks really cool,but he'd need something to make him stand out thematically as we already have already some monster champs and Omen doesn't really bring that much to the table in terms of themes.So I'd really love a version of him,even if the only thing they keep is the smile and the fact that he is 4-legged.\n\n**Rob Blackblade**:We don't really have a dedicated master thief or brigand,so Riot could do something with his theme,but otherwise there is literally nothing worth keeping about him.\n\n**Well:**This is the one I voted for because I'd really like a water elemental.Sure we already have a water mage with Nami,but a water elemental still feels different enough to fit in and we already have elemental champs for the other elements with {{champion:63}} {{champion:40}} {{champion:54}} even if they aren't literal elementals.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pale Mask","date":"2018-09-01T10:21:40.370+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well would be interesting, since we don't have a pure water mage outside Nami. I like Gavid, but he'd be repetitive after Ivern's release.\n\nI think I'd like Averdrian the most, since his design (which looks like the crest of the Shadow Isles) and theme (psion/mentalist/esper) is pretty unique. Perhaps they could make him a mage and tie him into the Blessed Isles story or some other faction.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Agent Corgi","date":"2018-09-01T01:51:19.939+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm torn between Rob Blackblade & Omen. \n\nDemacia has Mages, Tanks, Marksmen, Fighters & Supports.

There are so many incredible ways to pull off a hydrokinetic's moveset, just look at Morphling in dota 2, one of my favorite hero concepts ever created across any moba. With some obvious modernizing (his old e was just supposed to be a mana regen passive, wouldn't really fit league's playstyle now adays,) Well's moveset could have given us an incredible storm-at-sea fantasy in game we don't have with any other mage character; something that revolves around huge, splash damage skillshot aoes and maybe a liquid monster form or something crazy for his ult (I'm almost picturing a water version of Ragnaros from hots, here.)

So, one fine Urf Day back in Season 2, Riot dropped an announcement that Lee Sin had been revived and was coming out!  On...April 1st.  And all of his teaser shots had Urf somewhere in there.\n\nNaturally you all know how this goes now, but back then there was fierce debate over whether or not we were actually getting Lee Sin, or if our beloved Manatee would finally return.  Riot was particularly cagey about it, and there was even a fake Champion Spotlight for Lee Sin that showcased him doing ridiculous crap like one-shotting the Nexus and disabling Surrenders, because **ONLY LEE SIN DECIDES WHEN THE GAME ENDS**.\n\n\nSorry, tangent aside, I really only feel like Omen felt complete enough.  Rob is hilariously generic, \"Eagle Rider\", Well, and Avasha are little more than concepts, Gavid, Averdrian, and Tabu were used as jokes on the old Halloween Summoner's Rift map, and Priscilla (who isn't on this list, but she was like a spider lady, more spidery than Elise) was \"immortalized\" as a Dominion item.
