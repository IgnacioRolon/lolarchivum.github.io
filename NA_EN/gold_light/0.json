We know that they retconned the League and the Institute of War so that they&#039;d have more freedom to write what they want without Summoners intervening, and to an extent, that worked. However, Riot is still somewhat limited in what they can write, given that every Champion in the story has a degree of necessary plot armor. They can&#039;t canonically kill off any character because it would upset fans of that character and it would just be weird playing a champion in-game that technically no longer exists. The closest we&#039;ve ever gotten to a Champion in League truly dying was Gangplank back during the Burning Tides event, but even that turned out to just lead into another visual update. It&#039;s completely understandable why Riot doesn&#039;t want to kill off their characters, however it does mean that we&#039;ll likely never get a conclusion to several of their story arcs; we&#039;ll never seen Lucian free Senna from Thresh&#039;s grasp, we&#039;ll never see Rengar and Kha&#039;Zix determine who&#039;s the superior hunter, and we&#039;ll never Miss Fortune TRULY kill of Gangplank or vice-versa.\r\n\r\nHOWEVER, it occurred to me only recently that Riot has already solved this issue, at least to extent. There&#039;s a Champion in the game already who perfectly shows how to kill off a character without really killing them off: {{champion:141}} Kayn. Kayn&#039;s entire gameplay gimmick is a &quot;what-if&quot; scenario, with the player choosing whether the human can overpower the Darkin or vice-versa. Canonically, it&#039;s unlikely we&#039;ll ever see a story in which one truly triumphs over the other, but thanks to Kayn&#039;s dual-form gimmick, we know what the possible outcomes of their struggle looks like and where it can lead them.\r\n\r\nThis, I think, can serve as a possible solution for Riot&#039;s story-tellers who are unable to properly conclude any rivalries in the game. Instead of canonically killing off anyone, what if we were to get stories that showed possible outcomes of struggles between Champions? Imagine a story revolving around the struggle between Xerath and Azir that had two alternate endings: one where Xerath wins, and one where Azir wins. Neither is necessarily canon to the current lore state, but shows how one Ascendant can triumph over the other, and what the after-math is.\r\n\r\nI know that this would be a lot of effort for Riot&#039;s lore team, but I think this is a possible solution to one of the biggest issues in League&#039;s narrative. These &quot;what-if&quot; scenarios can let Riot show us where a Champion can be headed or what their resolution would be without necessarily having to kill off anyone&#039;s favorite character. And of course, if someone doesn&#039;t like the outcome that&#039;s presented, they&#039;re technically free to ignore it as it hasn&#039;t happened yet in the lore.\r\n\r\nI don&#039;t know if we&#039;ll ever be able to get something like this, but I think it would be a really cool way to finally conclude certain story lines that otherwise will never be able to receive closure.","replies":[{"poster":"GreenLore","date":"2018-05-28T16:40:39.309+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think thats a good idea for several reasons:\n\n1.It would quickly get confusing,which lore piece is set in which alternate canon.I mean for example the outcome of Kayns struggle would greatly affect the lores around the darkin and the order of the shadow,they'd need to release several lore pieces for each outcome,at which point it'd become difficult to keep track of all the different canons.\n\n2.These lore pieces would ultimately feel rather pointless,as they wouldn't affect the main canon.\n\n3.I don't even think that Riot has a \"no-death rule\",because right now almost all champs are still in the early stages of their lores,so of course none of them get killed off.That wouldn't make sense,it'd be like having Harry Potter die after the first 3 chapters.","replies":[{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2018-05-30T00:22:32.185+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"1) Comics books pull it off all the time, and people manage to follow despite the confusion.\n\n2) I kinda agree, if you present it in a \"main lore VS what if\" manner as OP suggested.

Not likely, given that this would mean Sion is now dead for good and every Voidborn champ (plus Malzahar) is probably gone. Nobody wants their favorite champion to be killed off, so Riot is currently stuck in a position where they can't kill anyone off without upsetting the playerbase.\n\nThis is the primary issue I was trying to address.

How would you (and the rest of the Story, Art & Sound Board) feel if, say, there were little interactive versions of a champ's story.  Now, before anyone gets too excited, this is just a hypothetical, but it's something I've been thinking about with stories being presented in various mediums in other IPs.\n\nAs an example - there was a game released a while ago, that had a famous IP, and both players and the developers had strong opinions on what was, and was not, appropriate to see in that game.  Some players found the inclusion of characters in a level/time/setting, but who would never have been able to attend that level were in in the movies, jarring and broke their immersion.  Developers (I believe, and I may be misremembering this so I apologize - it works for this hypothetical anyway) found this to be acceptable within the IP, due to the type of game it was - but claimed that suggestions of extreme costume changes (that would be out of character) as too far.  Some players (probably not the same players who cried anachronism or immersion) didn't see why it would be a big deal.  And beyond all this - the very nature of the game was to play out the actions of certain IP events - almost certainly having it play out in an alternative way to what was seen in other media (the 'canon' version).\n\nSo to apply this to a champ's story - imagine that there is a canon version of the events that transpired.  Let's take Nami's bio as an example.  There is a canon version of Nami's bio - both in written and comic form.  If there were an interactive version where you could choose, as Nami, whether to dodge left or right when threatened by a underwater monster - which of those actions is canon?  Does it bother you that some players took the other option?  Now obviously dodging left or right (if there were no differing outcome) is pretty much the definition of a trivial difference - but at what point does a difference become too big?\n\nIf, in an interactive version, Nami could, though your actions, fail in her mission and not get the abyssal pearl - my personal opinion is that most players would understand that that was not the canon outcome.  What if you, the player, chose to kill or spare Rasho?  Would you want some indication of what the canon events are/were, and if so - would that diminish the purpose of the whole endeavor?\n\nI guess it's related to your OP - an interactive story involving a champ would be a What If by its very definition because having a choice means the opportunity to take the choice that isn't 'canon'.\n\nWhat do you all think?\n\n**TL;DR - If you're playing a Spiderman game, and you fail a web-swing and slam into the windscreen of a bus, do you consider that canon?  How do you know in an interactive experience what is, and isn't canon?**","replies":[{"poster":"EROTIC RAID BOSS","date":"2018-05-29T01:05:02.154+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well what game it is matters, the context matters... I suppose you can't say for some reason.\n\nIf it's something arcadey like star wars battlefront multiplayer, that wouldn't break my immersion anymore than ashe on butcher's bridge. However if there was like, a star wars telltale game, and darth vader suddenly showed up in a story set after he'd died, or in the prequel age, obviously that would be extremely jarring. Basically, if the game or mode in question is trying to tell a story then it should do so with integrity, but if its just a bit of non story fun, then it's fine. League the game falls in the latter category, while the lore on the universe site is the former. \n\nIf you guys are trying to tell a champion's story though, it really needs to be either without a lot of player agency, or fit into canon in a way that either choices won't affect the lore majorly. As an example, in the game of thrones telltale game, there's a lot of times you meet and talk to characters from the show. And while your choices can have major consequences for the game only characters, the choices  you make don't really affect the show's characters in major ways. \n\nI think even though league is not very lore focused, you want to be careful of breaking the immersion for people that do care about runeterra. I remember how much WoW cataclysm aggravated me because the story of the game no longer synced up, with a character you leveled being in the present levels 1-60 then jumping to the past when he goes to older expansion content like WotLK.","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2018-05-29T01:28:25.192+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"There's no context because I'm just idly pondering the topic.\n\nLet's take the Walking Dead Telltale game as an example though - by choosing to follow 'non-canon' characters that are not present in the TV (or comic?) universe, Telltale were able to create their own canon.  Now clearly to prevent any jarring immersion breaking moments, if they had crossovers (of characters or events) then they need to ensure that they don't allow the player to break the canon of the TV/comic universes.  For example, if they showed one of the characters from the TV show in the game, then the player shouldn't be able to optionally cause the death or visible mutilation of that character if it is intended that the character will reappear in the TV show.\n\nThat would be like if League had a game series about Chem-Baron Takeda, with crossovers only very infrequently and without any main-canon consequence.\n\nAn alternative view would be Batman.  There are a LOT of Batman stories out there - so many, and many of them aren't intended to be in the same 'universe' as each other.  The events of the Gotham TV show isn't quite in line with the Telltale games, which aren't quite in line with the Dark Knight Trilogy of movies, which interpret but diverge from many of the comic storylines, which are pretty different from Lego Batman, Batman Ninja, Justice League, the Rocksteady Arkham series, the Adam West TV show, and so much more.\n\nIt seems to me that if you were to make a new Batman game, for example, you'd want to stay utterly loyal to the character of Batman and his relationships with the classic allies and enemies - but the specifics of the story seem to be up for grab.  Which feels very different from the earlier attitude - even in a story focused game like the Telltale Batman games.\n\nIs it just that some IP/settings have a different tolerance for this kind of flexibility?  If there's a scale, where could League sit on that scale?  I honestly don't know - I'm thinking 'out loud' so to speak :)","replies":[{"poster":"World Ender","date":"2018-05-29T02:58:28.905+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Not the OP, but if here's my opinion.\n\nI personally feel that the canon for League (at least the main champions) should be well defined and not stray into a gray area of debatability. League's basic lore isn't even complete yet, and likely won't be for a long time with all the reworks that still need to happen. We don't yet have a complete idea of what Runeterra looks like, or timelines, let alone all the characters' updated bios. There is still much to do before League even has a complete world. And the complete, vibrant, bustling world is what I envision for League, much like Star Wars (before Disney, RIP expanded universe). Not everything has to be about our champions; many players (including myself) find stories like Progress Day or The Principles of Strength to be amazing, even though they only have a passing influence on the main canon of League. The settings that have already been established are wonderful avenues for countless new stories that don't involve a single champion. \n\nNow, some people may not find these stories interesting (I'm sure you guys have stats on read time or clicks for stories or whatever so you can make better calls on what is successful or not) but at the very least they serve as an alternative for people like me who really care about the world and all its minor details. And, as you mention with your example of the Chem Baron, these side stories are perfect opportunities to give players some choices. Since they have little impact on champions, there should be no conflicts with the main lore no matter what paths the player takes. This might even have the side effect of getting more people interested in these stories, since they could take a cool concept like a Chem Baron and mold them in the way they want!\n\nTo take a bit of step back, my problem personally with adding in different outcomes for a character story is that could easily lead to a slippery slope of lore contradictions. What if there was a timeline where Taliyah hadn't met Yasuo? How would that impact Taliyah as a character, or even Yasuo? Could that then change Taliyah's interactions with Azir if she meets him in the future? The next time Taliyah gets a story, do you include an option for Taliyah having never met Yasuo, or do you just go with the canon? What is canon at that point? It could cause problems with persistent worldbuilding and impact stories in the future unless the canon is extremely rigidly defined.\n\nBut in doing that you might also make some players upset, as readers will likely attach to one story or the other, but not both. If you lay out a certain ending as canon, but still offer a choice for the non canon ending, a lot of players will hold attachment to the non-canon one and wonder why their favorite character is canonically represented differently to what they wanted. And what if more players choose the non-canon ending than the canon one, do Riot have to change what's canon? Unless the choices are very minor, I foresee that giving players a non-canon option may do more harm than good to the lore, separate the community, and just make a big mess. \n\nDon't forget that League also has another medium for storytelling. In game is where all the crazy and weird stuff can happen without lore repercussion. Interaction between Kled and Aatrox may never happen in the lore, but we get to see what it would be like if they met through in game quotes. This \"could be canon\" is totally fair game for alternate stories, because I think most people understand that what happens in game isn't so rigid (Thresh supporting Lucian would never happen in lore but happens in game all the time, etc). \n\nWe already have these types of special quotes in game, but what if it were taken a step further to not only have lore friendly interactions, but give players choice in them? What if a champion had several greetings for another, that the player could choose? For example, if Lux saw Garen in game, she could greet him respectfully, playfully, maybe tease him, etc, but it would only happen once per game. All of those responses \"could be canon\" but since you only get it once per game, you have the option to choose how you want Lux to present herself. Obviously this would require extra VO work and so may not be feasible, but I think that a lot of the in game space for lore is wasted and so having more options sort of like this would be welcome.\n\nTLDR, I think that putting choice in main champion stories isn't the could cause quite a few problems, but I would definitely welcome player choice in side character stories or even in game if a system could be designed to do so. \n\nThanks for taking the time to read this Bio, I'm really excited for lore to grow and expand in new ways, and so I'm glad you're having some discussion about it. Lore always been one of my favorite things about games in general and especially League, to the point that I'm sure even if I stop playing I'll keep reading! \n\n~~Also map when haha (sorry)~~","replies":[]},{"poster":"EROTIC RAID BOSS","date":"2018-05-29T02:58:12.191+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think comics have an extreme tolerance for that kind of thing yeah. People are very accustomed to different takes on the same characters, even within a single universe (ie: Frank Miller's grimdark Batman is very different from Greg Rucka's brokenrelationships Batman which is very different from Grant Morrison's Batman as the perfect zen human, and then there's all sorts of events that partially or fully rebooted comics batman), much less the many interpretations across different \"universes\". \n\nThe characters in comics have been around so long that they're like modern myths, reinterpreting them is like seeing different interpretations of greek or norse gods. I guess there's a tolerance for other IPs too like transformers, but I think that mostly comes down to how long these IPs have been around- a reboot is not seen as weird for something from the 40s or even 80s. I also think League's main lore is not really that fleshed out- do we need to do what if stories or other non canon stuff when there's so much to be done with the main canon? I want to know more about Ashe or Azir in universe, because they're only so fleshed out, it would feel kind of wasteful if a lot of effort went into characterizing some alternate version of them.\n\nI will say though that the skin universes could be an exception. You could kill off characters in the project universe for example, and people would probably like to know more about that world, or star guardian. But personally I want to see more of the main lore, and I want it to 'count'. Might sound silly, I thought it was a silly in comics, but the situation feels different. \n\nAlso I'm not opposed to story driven games that just tell stories rather than trying to give you tons of choices. Like I like mass effect and dragon age, I like life is strange. But I also enjoy it when we learn more about characters rather than trying to design them ourselves, games like the Last of Us, God of War, JRPGs, or even on smaller scales games like Celeste, that's some good shit too. I think similar to how open world games sacrifice tight gameplay and challenges for freedom, bioware style story freedom has its downsides too.\n\n\n\nI like the walking dead approach but I know it could be hard for players to invest in a runeterra set game not starring their fav champions. So I dunno if a telltale league game would be the best idea financially, but I'd play the hell out of it personally. Although I'd want even more a game that lets me really explore runeterra.

When it comes to games, I hate the inclination to discuss \"story\" to specifically mean non-interactive elements (cutscenes, dialogue boxes, etc.).  However, in my opinion, gameplay IS narrative in the same way thatbyou recounting things that happened to you IRL is narrative.  I watched an Extra Creditz video awhile ago that discussed the idea of \"player as artist\".  That is to say, while non-interactive media exist regardless of witness, interactive media simply does not exist without someone to interact with it.  The plays that you, personally, make are a valid unique experience to you.  There is no \"set\" order of tasks, there is no \"one canon\" outside of non-interactive elements (a better term night be \"mandatory\" elements, as winning or losing a level is a form of interaction, but winning the level is a prerequisite for other parts of the game).\n\nOf course, different works frame gameplay differently.  Some outright ignore gameplay as \"inconsequential\" while only cutscenes matter (even if they depict largely the same occurances).  You asked how big a difference must be before it is no longer inconsequential.  However, I'd say the difference is more in the original creator's intent, not in the player's.  Take for example a standard boss fight.  Regardless of what strategy you use to take it down, the outcome is the same and the game's direction is no different.  But let's say you have a dialogue choice, with each answer leading you to a different piece of dialogue within that conversation, but having no bearing on any other part of the game (just like how you can beat the boss with multiple methods, you tackle the conversation in one of a few ways).  This can be considered different than when your dialogue choice leads to an alternate path; for example, maybe you get a choice between multiple bosses that all have different moral implications in the context of the game, and deciding which one you fight permanently locks off certain pieces of content.  Maybe killing that boss meant you had betrayed an ally's trust and are no longer avle to view their arc.\n\nI described multiple levels of outcome variance, but ultimately, if you bottleneck your experience where a certain piece of content is mandatory to continue regardless of your previous choices, we can without a doubt consider that \"canon\".  Furthermore, if a set pathway mentions a specific choice you made and it's the same option, regardless of which option you actually chose (this is common in sequels to games with branching stories or games with a \"true ending\"), we can assume that is \"canon\".  But from here I'd like to stop using \"canon\" to mean the \"one true continuity\", and instead use it in the more traditonal sense.\n\nGoing back to player as artist, I'd posit there is no universal continuity in *any* interactive media.  There are certainly strong overlaps between player experiences, but they are not *the same*, and there is no need for them to be the same.  As a person who feels no need to replay a game just to make different choices (I'm happy with the decisions I had made), I extend that viewpoint to all games I play.  It doesn't bother me that another player would make different decisions than I do, and I don't agree that there must be one-true continuity.  So long as the optional events are not directly referenced by a later work, the options are bith meaningful and personal--I am fine seeing this as \"my\" experience, as the version that I hold true.  And it's ok that others don't.  It's no different than playing an adventure game and taking an entirely different path than my friends.  I'd argue that games the segregate gameplay & story suffer because of the reality that there is one accepted truth: let's say a player is very bad at a game but a cutscene calls the player character \"masterful\".  It a player who plays incredibly haphazardly and aggressively, but the character is described as \"calm and calculated\".  In other words, there are only problems if actions the player DID NOT TAKE are directly referenced.  This makes the experience weaker for the sake of enforcing a \"true continuity\".\n\nThis was long-winded, but I am on my phone and I don't have time to edit for brevity, so \n\ntl;dr There need not be just one \"canon\"; it's fine for different people to get and accept different outcomes as their \"truth\" as long as a specific choice is not declared true by the original creators of the work, which would weaken the overall experience for those who chose \"wrong\".","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2018-05-29T02:03:51.439+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm a big fan of the player-narrative - the game only really exists in the player's mind, after all.  You could argue that there's a lot more player-narrative out there than just in games, too - like the interpretation your imagination creates when you read a book will be different from someone else's, but those will be minor compared to the differences between a player playing Skyrim in a hurry to complete the main questline vs. someone who spend tens of hours collecting herbs and working for the thieves guild.  Or the difference in tone that someone experiences playing Uplink on a really old PC running at a snails pace, vs. someone playing it on a decent PC at a manic, dangerous, pace (personal experience).\n\nGames of League have their own player stories, of course - the crushing defeat, the tension of waiting in that bush, the frienemies in top lane.  No-one expects in a multiplayer game for anyone to have the same player-narrative - even players in the same team have a pretty drastically different player-narrative on the same game.\n\n>It doesn't bother me that another player would make different decisions than I do, and I don't agree that there must be one-true continuity.

I think that many players are of a similar mindset - that they rate the value of their own experience in an interactive story, that having opportunities to _make_ it their own is of value in itself, but that whether or not those choices are the same as other players is secondary or lower.  \n\nI think there's an additional twist in that players today have ever more opportunities to see alternative experiences - watching Twitch streams, YouTube videos, discussions on forums or Discord, etc.  Some players never even play the game themselves - they read or watch them played by someone else.  And I think it's interesting that players can hold all these alternative experiences in their mind at the same time, including the cut-down version that might be what is considered 'canon' for the purposes of a sequel, and with a special place in their heart for their own experience.","replies":[{"poster":"Larriet","date":"2018-05-30T02:16:02.231+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You mentioned Skyrim, and the game I had on my mind when I was writing was Breath of the Wild, which was a game maligned for having a weak storyline, something I can't fully agree with because myplay through the game significantly affected the way I saw characters.  There was a specific character I immediately liked, and I ended up hanging around the town he was from to collect my thoughts.  The connectuon felt stronger than just \"a cutscene\" as I'd often see written online as the extent of the story.\n\nHOWEVER, a key difference between such games and League is the level of player interaction with other players.  For a wholly single-player game, having different versions of a character is more about the individual.  Another option is like Journey or Dark Souls, where other players are framed as a separate entity than You, the Player.\n\nCompare that to League of Legends, where the player not only portrays multiple characters, but may experience the *same* character as a separate entity.  This is true of most competitive and co-op games to some degree, where a character is portrayed more as being controlled by the player.  In League that's a \"Summoner\", although most games don't explicitly frame it.  So am I Nami right now?  Is the Nami I'm playing against the same \"character\" as the Nami on my team?  (I love Pulsefire Caitlyn, incidentally...)\n\nI will never see Link as another player while playing Zelda myself.  In Breath of the Wild, you can put a sign up with your name on it, and as someone who reads every dialogue box in every game no matter how many times I've replayed it already, I was genuinely SHOCKED when the sign said \"Link's House\" instead of my name!

Something like dodging left or right feels trivial as you said but having your choices affecting weather Kayn, defeats Rhaast would be interesting as the two paths could unlock new stories like a universe page for each character or something branching from the main Kayn one. Your Nami example I don't really feel for as her not getting the pearl just feels kind of meh. I know that she gets it and unless not getting the pearl causes an event where I'm rewarded with something like lore it just feels like a dead end or that the choice didn't matter since she gets the pearl anyway.","replies":[]},{"poster":"EROTIC RAID BOSS","date":"2018-05-29T03:13:21.027+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I like player narrative games too, but I don't know how people would feel about a basically non-canon story set in runeterra when the people who most care about that lore probably want something more definitive.

How would you (and the rest of the Story, Art &amp; Sound Board) feel if, say, there were little interactive versions of a champ&#x27;s story.  Now, before anyone gets too excited, this is just a hypothetical, but it&#x27;s something I&#x27;ve been thinking about with stories being presented in various mediums in other IPs.\n> \n> As an example - there was a game released a while ago, that had a famous IP, and both players and the developers had strong opinions on what was, and was not, appropriate to see in that game.  Some players found the inclusion of characters in a level/time/setting, but who would never have been able to attend that level were in in the movies, jarring and broke their immersion.  Developers (I believe, and I may be misremembering this so I apologize - it works for this hypothetical anyway) found this to be acceptable within the IP, due to the type of game it was - but claimed that suggestions of extreme costume changes (that would be out of character) as too far.  Some players (probably not the same players who cried anachronism or immersion) didn&#x27;t see why it would be a big deal.  And beyond all this - the very nature of the game was to play out the actions of certain IP events - almost certainly having it play out in an alternative way to what was seen in other media (the &#x27;canon&#x27; version).\n> \n> So to apply this to a champ&#x27;s story - imagine that there is a canon version of the events that transpired.  Let&#x27;s take Nami&#x27;s bio as an example.  There is a canon version of Nami&#x27;s bio - both in written and comic form.  If there were an interactive version where you could choose, as Nami, whether to dodge left or right when threatened by a underwater monster - which of those actions is canon?  Does it bother you that some players took the other option?  Now obviously dodging left or right (if there were no differing outcome) is pretty much the definition of a trivial difference - but at what point does a difference become too big?\n> \n> If, in an interactive version, Nami could, though your actions, fail in her mission and not get the abyssal pearl - my personal opinion is that most players would understand that that was not the canon outcome.  What if you, the player, chose to kill or spare Rasho?  Would you want some indication of what the canon events are/were, and if so - would that diminish the purpose of the whole endeavor?\n> \n> I guess it&#x27;s related to your OP - an interactive story involving a champ would be a What If by its very definition because having a choice means the opportunity to take the choice that isn&#x27;t &#x27;canon&#x27;.\n> \n> What do you all think?\n> \n> **TL;DR - If you&#x27;re playing a Spiderman game, and you fail a web-swing and slam into the windscreen of a bus, do you consider that canon?  How do you know in an interactive experience what is, and isn&#x27;t canon?**\n\nreply to the tldr you dont. it doesnt matter what is and isnt canon. what matters is that you recreate the world in a believable way. i've played many spiderman games and because i thought i was playing the spiderman movie game when a villain showed up i thought it was going to be in the movie. in that way i was let down more so by the movie than the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2018-05-29T02:59:23.427+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Interactive stories don't work for a game like League, that has contiguous lore.

If you don’t what that is character’s dying the coming back maybe half year to 2 years later. But what can be stopped from being pointless is character development or newfound purpose. \n\nI truly believe League Lore can take a lot of inspiration from Marvel and DC to how to build the universe and make so many different characters interactive with each other when otherwise it wouldn’t make sense. Cape comics for example makes someone like Hawkeye who uses a bow of all things make sense with characters who are technologically advanced beyond our imaginations. Because I see that as a common criticism how can Piltover and Demacia co-exist as an example. Another thing I want to see is established multiversity but that’s not needed more of a nice bonus.","replies":[]}]}
