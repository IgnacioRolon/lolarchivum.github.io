Trying to get my team to work together?","subforum":"Player Behavior","up_votes":2,"down_votes":19,"body":"TLDR I type to coordinate my team. They're low ELO so they dont understand basic map control. I explain to win games. I'm on a 9 game winstreak and trying to keep it that way by instilling a sense of direction to my team. Sure, they may not like my opinion about ZAC being a bad champion(despite my complimenting the player)... Or, Irelia IN FACT throwing the game ON PURPOSE. But, really? I insulted NOBODY and I'm banned? I styraight up did NOTHING WRONG except TALK TO MY FUCKING TEAM... and I'm banned? Seriously? Yo... What is the mute button for? If you dont like me telling you PLEASE HELP ME... and explaining why... Can't the onus be on the fucking player to mute me? Why am I punished for trying to coordinate with my team? Honestly. Yeah, It is a FACT the player is bronze. It is also a FACT I'm platinum. everyone on my team except Irelia was doing fine. She threw, and I acknowledged that. And explained how this is what holds people back man. I'm a fucking hostage in this ELO to this nonsense. I NEVER CALL PEOPLE BAD. I NEVER INSULT THEM. I absolutely dont care about their opinions and I absolutely curse sometimes. That's what the FILTER is for if you're sensitive to it. I absolutely type alot... that is what CHAT MUTE is for, if you dislike it. But to spend 40 minutes of my life trying to coordinate and teamwork, to be banend for stating facts, is fucking ridiculous.\r\n\r\nGame 1\r\nPre-Game\r\nDescyphal: dont\r\nDescyphal: ban\r\nDescyphal: sion\r\nDescyphal: www.twitch.tv/descyphalreal check me out on Twitch, click Follow(it's free)!

You do realize you can only see one side, right? Absolutely it is frustrated speak. but Negative? I said a CHAMPION sucks. I never said the player did. Infact, I even went as far as to compliment the zac player as a player, and said the champion pick is not useful. This is advice. Not negativity. \n\nThe talking to bronze thing, at the end, was AFTER game, in post-game chat. And was in fact talking to a pair of once again, admitted bronze players. let alone what NA.OP.GG said they were for ranks last season.\n\nHonestly... Skim the chat, and look at it like excitement and shot calling direction giving, as opposed to negativity.

In your analogy, in a courtroom, professional witnesses are questions in terms of their credibility, every single time the cross examination begins.\n\nSorry. If you find my annoying, you can mute me. But when I'm not attacking or creating the issue, to ban me is nonsensical. That's like saying if you're in a group of people, and someone breaks into a car, you're guilty for the several others blaming you, because you didn't get along with the person who committed the crime. In this case, the player on my team insulting me gave up and fed on purpose. His friend and he reported me. I was banned because I talked to my teammates?\n\nI was literally being insulted, attacked and berated and I simply said I'm not feeding I'm pushing. In this very same game I had the same deaths as the person who reported me, however I had more objectives. than they did. I was trying to win.\n\nYour point is moot.

I recieved a chat restriction from a DUO that reported me, because I was shotcalling and they didn't like that. So not only am I called racist shit and sexist shit all game, but I admittedly told them to fuck off before I muted them. That got em restricted(Even though there's a chat filter to cover the curse word and a mute button used to cover the insulting towards me)... even though i NEVER insulted them. \n\nI NEVER insult people. EVER. I make a GIGANTIC point of that. I might call something bronze. Because some things are indeed and infact bronze level. I also go out of my way to encourage people to add me, or check out my stream to learn things. As I EXPLAIN why when inhibitors are down we should do objectives.\n\nLook, just reading my responses here is the SAME EXACT method of approach I take in-game. I communicate and explain. Communicate and explain. I get flamed every game every day. But what matters to me is the teamwork.

The objective of \"trying to get the team to work together\" is OK, but the end doesn't justify the means. Too many people think that because they \"really care about the game and winning\" they have the right to say anything to others.\n\nAs you got frustrated you progressed to griefing, sarcasm, condescension, passive-aggressiveness, rude language, ELO shaming , etc. Yes, getting frustrated is also not an excuse.

But, here's the question, am I?\n\nThe person was bronze. To say they're bronze, is not abusive.\nGriefing? I was attacked, insulted and accused of feeding on purpose. I played the game and told them to relax.\nSarcasm? I made a joke in the beginning. In champ select jokes were also made, not by me, mind. I followed my humor to it's natural direction with my allies. BASED ON CHAMP SELECT. Remember, they stole my role here. And after my joke, I accepted it. And proceeded to do more than my allies map wide.\nCondescension... Wow. So, I spoke as though I'm confident in my decisions and not theirs. I should be banned for defending myself?\nPassive-aggressiveness. This is literally the dumbest shit I've ever heard. You're suggesting that I was passive aggressive by saying \"I'm pushing\"..? Or maybe... when I told people calling me names to 're fucking lax'? You're being silly, now. That's about as passive aggressive as telling someone to calm down when they're throwing a tantrum.\nRude language? ... Yeah, no. I was literally diffusing the situation by trying to reason with my teams dozens of insults.\nELO shaming? ... By calling out a bronze insult as a bronze insult and moving forward to attempt to win the game... Yeah. I shamed a toxic player for toxicity? I guess I should lose hundreds of dollars of my investment for telling someone who is giving the opposing team the ball, that they've got the concept of the game, wrong.\n\nGetting frustrated is NOT a reason to ban someone. As much as it is not an excuse. Think about what you're saying. Imagine it was YOUR investment being taken from you, for simply defending yourself and playing the game.\n\nPeople I will never see again, is correct. Because league is dying, and I'm not interested in spending any more time, or my fucking money, on a community which punishes players for being attacked.\n\nSidenote, riots response to my contest of this decision is \"I went ham\" and \"I should mute players instead of taunt them\". So, my ban was sustained because I apparently fucking taunted someone by not saying anything at all, accepting my role being taken from me, doing well and trying to win.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"C9 Aphrolift","date":"2018-11-23T23:03:07.573+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can still win games and not be sportmanslike.

This just doesn't line up with how things work.  In fact, even if the ratio was 10 to 1, this is still not good.
