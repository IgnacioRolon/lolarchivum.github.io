I first started playing the game when it was sold in stores. I have never at any point received so much as a notification to my email regarding any kind of problem with my account or any indication that I may be in danger of being suspended. What's even better, is that after my account was suspended yesterday, I was instructed to check my email for information about the suspension. Well wouldn't you know it there is nothing in my email about this. Now I try to log on to the account today to see if it specified what time the suspension runs to (it was set to end tomorrow) and now it is suspended until the 3rd of November. \r\n\r\nI sent in a report ticket to Riot obviously since they banned my account while giving me absolutely no information as to why I was being banned, and they say nothing. You know I've defended Riot a lot in the past since I enjoy League of Legends so much. It's incredibly hurtful to be on the receiving end of the lackluster treatment that other people have apparently been subject to in the past when I actually defended Riot.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-21T20:43:07.700+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Looking into this, nothing has been said because a specialist hasn't retrieved your ticket yet.
