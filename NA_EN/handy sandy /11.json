However, in higher ELO he gets abused early and kited more. His winrate falls off really hard. Check lolalytics for example. In Diamond+ Top is 48% and JG 46% while for Plat+ (which is basically all Plat games), he's at 49% winrate. The higher you go, the worse Mundo becomes.","replies":[]},{"poster":"dunder kill","date":"2017-02-20T01:41:37.635+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mundo is absolute dogshit against AD comps which is the meta right now.
