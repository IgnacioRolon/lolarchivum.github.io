Previously, I'd be able to block him and knock him away from any type of way he'd enter (from ult/stunning/spearjab/spearthrow/etc.) now I can no longer block him or knock him up with Azir's ult under any circumstance. I know Azir is a bit buggy but I still love his design. If there would be a possible fix to this, that'd be great :D","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2014-11-06T04:15:04.352+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the report.

Seems like those should be switched, given that the soldiers are entirely useless if not dropped in the right location (it costs a fair amount of mana to Q them into autoattack position every time you want them at a specific location).","replies":[]},{"poster":"AtheosisX","date":"2014-11-05T23:46:19.955+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sure would've been nice if Riot had done a little more due diligence with Azir before releasing him.

Until my kids matured enough to recognize the value of smartcast, each of us was constantly having to remember to switch it when using the machine after someone else.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AHeroNamedHawke","date":"2014-11-06T18:27:02.036+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I tried ulting a low hp Kennen towards my team and he walked through it unscathed","replies":[]},{"poster":"Frinall","date":"2014-11-06T17:46:24.405+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Played with an Azir yesterday, and had one of his ult's bug out causing us to be Aced. Pretty frustrating. In this case we were fighting in the bushes around mid lane/river. I forget who the enemy champs were but at the time it seemed that the glitch may have been caused due to the fact that we were vacating the bushes as the ult fired, and so all of the enemy champs were coming at us from the fog of war. Pretty sure both Lee Sin and Jax leapt at us and ***THROUGH*** the Azir ult, and then Fiora simply walked through.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dharman","date":"2014-11-06T05:36:38.266+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"2 games now my azir's ult is failing most of the time  ....so many people hating on me  :'(","replies":[]},{"poster":"AloneInTheCrowd","date":"2014-11-06T02:53:54.885+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What do you mean by \" too manly \" , we talking about THE manliest man in the league {{champion:80}}","replies":[]}]}
