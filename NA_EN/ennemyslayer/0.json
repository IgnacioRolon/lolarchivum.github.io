This will help create more tactic as you will have to choose between buying champions or items. Your Rift store is already functional and players are already used to it. That would also fix the balance between players, because some people get a lot of items while other gain only gold.\r\n\r\n - 2 - Some items should be dropable, but only items created for TFT like the spatula and more items that you guys could think of. (Like an item that gives one star when they are mixed together, etc.)\r\n\r\n- 3 - I would keep the round where the champions walk in circle, but I would put gold over their head for more balance. 1 grey champion could have 5 golds and a gold champion 1 gold. The TFT items could also be hovering over their head.\r\n\r\n- 4 - I think the gold income mechanic is really solid. I would keep that. The only thing I would fix is the leaver problem. If you manage to lose on purpose to get the bonus gold and you win a fight against someone who left and isn't there, you should be able to keep your lost streak. Same thing when there is a tie. You should keep your winning or losing streak.\r\n\r\nThere, that's all I had to say. I hope some people will read this and tell me what they think. \r\n\r\nThank you for reading.","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-08-12T03:30:32.744+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"What game(s) have you designed?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Xhandel","date":"2019-08-12T03:21:24.909+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"From a fellow game designer:\n\n1. Very bad idea. This only helps people that are lucky to get the champions they need to start playing econ, if you need to reroll to search a specific champion, then youre screwed against the dude that already had them, because that dude will get to 50+ gold and will start using that gold excess to build every champ he have. Even if you could only buy one copy of each item, its enough to get a GA, a morellos and a statik shyv, this as an extra from the items you already got from creeps.\n\n2. Another very bad idea, this would give a extremely powerfull advantage to someone if they get that item, imagine you at lvl 6 - 7, have a lvl 2 cho and got that combination of items to reise him to lvl 3, same for aurelion, draven, yasuo, akali, anivia... what can the other players do against that at that point of the game.\n\n3. This seems like a good idea, but should need to be tested, sometimes, some of those 1 coin champions have very usefull and contested items, like bow, BF, tear, and sometimes a complete item, so, getting a complete item and 5 coins, too much, but can work.\n\n4. On a Tie, it supposed that both lose, except if its the final match, then i dont see why should you keep the win streak, the leavers... its hard to assest, i agree with you, but at the same time i dont, because is not something that have to be with the game mechanics, but with a negative person.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GipJoCalderone","date":"2019-08-12T06:35:21.670+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Buying items is a bad idea. First, it'll create a situation where #1 player is unbeatable bacause he has RNG bless to have great champs and comps in early game maybe even without rolling so he has echo advantage, he can invast his win streak money to buy items and make the gap even larger. Second, if u do so, everyone will be complainning about monsters dropping items instead because players who get gold drop get to choose items but players get item drop just have to accept what system give u.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-08-12T04:38:30.827+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is how you cause total meta stagnation even faster.
