Riot have decided that this bug isn&#039;t &quot;game breaking&quot; enough to be bothered to hotfix the problem asap in-fact they have decided that we can wait out the whole patch for it lol.\n\nRiot KateyKhaos - &quot;(I&#039;m just the messenger here, so I don&#039;t have much additional info.)&quot;\n\nSo the correct department that has been informed of this bug but haven&#039;t got the time to tell everyone about this game breaking bug for the majority of players who play locked camera. Instead we are left with no knowledge or recognition of the severity of this  bug except that its being worked on for the entirety of patch 6.2 AKA its not big enough of a bug ( even though its game breaking ) for us to be bothered to do anything about it.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-02-02T18:12:49.815+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey again! \n\nJust wanted to clarify! \n\nSince I started the conversation regarding this issue, I wanted to continue it by providing updates when I received them, which is why you've been seeing me replying to posts with the info I'm getting from the devs working on this issue.

The only information that has been of any value that you have obtained is \"This issue won't be fixed in 6.2\" which even then isn't exactly great news. \n\nYes i know your working on the issue but i know for a fact that if this bug affected unlocked camera, you would probably disable ranked ( tell me if im wrong ) let alone wait until patch 6.2 has finished. Now considering the majority of your players would be say around #1 bronze, #2 silver, #3 gold divisions id be a gambling man and say ALOT of them players play with there camera locked (id go as far as saying the majority of them do), im currently in plat 3 after the reset and even i play with the camera locked the majority of the time.\n\nIm fine with the situation now, im going to wait it out. Just got abit annoyed that's all as i dont think this bug is being treated to the level of priority it should.

There's a work-around, and its a small minority that the bug affects. That, whether you like it or not, prevents it from being their highest priority. Sorry, just how it is.\n\nThe fact that you're so entitled to think that you are more important than what Riot deems is important for **their** game as a whole and think I'm trying to get a reaction from you because of that is petty. \n\nYou yourself have no information.

What information would they give you? There's not much you can do until you find the source of the bug in the code, which can take a long time. The strangest things can cause bugs, sometimes in unrelated pieces of code entirely. Once they find the source of the issue, they can start fixing it. They probably won't though, after wasting a lot of time looking for it, and they'll just create an automated work-around like always, perpetuating their spaghetti code and making issues like this harder to solve without perpetuating their coding issues further.\n\nThere's a reason bugfixes take a long time for Riot. The coding is archaic for their needs, yet they still try to build on it and work with it.\n\n\n\n> Now move on WoodStruck, useless and no help at all yet again.\n\nYou don't want help except \"Hey, the bug has been fixed!\"\n\nThat's not on me, that's on you.

It isn't game breaking as much as its annoying, and you don't have to play with locked camera on.
