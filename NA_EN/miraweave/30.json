WE NEED MORE TRANSPARENT MODERATION!","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] General Discussion","up_votes":11,"down_votes":4,"body":"Please. The problem isn't that the mods are banning people for good reasons, or that we don't properly understand the rules. The problem is that **nobody **has any real idea what's going on, and the only times anyone hears anything is when someone gets permabanned and someone else posts their side of the story.\r\n\r\nI've got nothing against people getting banned if they've clearly violated the rules, but right now nobody has any idea what the rules even are, and the endless rumors flying around don't help *at all*. I feel that it should be done in a public way for a while so that everyone has a clear picture of the rules and of exactly why each individual person received a ban. We need the moderators to actually come out and have a talk with us, or this is just going to keep happening.\r\n\r\nCan we *please* just have an open discussion about moderation?","replies":[]}
