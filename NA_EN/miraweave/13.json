E doubles as a good waveclear tool.\n\nComparing this to other high-mobility AD carries, who lack either one or more of these traits:\n{{champion:81}} : Lacks non-ult waveclear unless building blue.\n{{champion:67}} : No waveclear at all.\n{{champion:15}} : Short auto-attack range, but unlike Lucian, no (spammable) instant repositioning tools. Boomerang Blade has long range, but isn't as good a fire-and-forget long ranged waveclear tool due to the harsh damage falloff. To devour waves, Sivir needs to get into AA range.\n{{champion:133}} : Shorter than usual AA range. Low waveclear (Q doesn't do too much damage and doesn't pass through minions).\n\n{{champion:222}} : Conditionally very mobile, very low mobility otherwise.

So we keep having this issue where there's very little reason to pick an immobile champion ever, because for 90% of immobile champions either\n\nA. There exists another champion that does the same thing the immobile champion does while being mobile; for example, why would I ever pick Udyr (a high-damage jungler with 1 hard CC) when I could pick Vi (another high-damage jungler with mobility and a hard CC). \n\nB. They are screwed over so hard by enemy mobility that their advantages compared to the mobile champions are completely irrelevant. Take, for example, Ashe. She does something that no other mobile champion in the game does (ranged permaslow) but she's still not pickable because if the other team picks any kind of mobile assassin she's just going to feed them kill after kill. \n\nLet's take a look at some of the other members of the immobile champion roster for some more examples. \n\n{{champion:63}} : The immobility poster boy and IIRC the only champion to never be selected in any LCS game ever. Yeah, he will burst 2-3 people for 75% of their health in a teamfight. There is no reason to pick him over someone like Kennen (who bursts their entire team AND brings CC AND has mobility) or Xerath (who will also burst your team, but will do it from twice as far away as Brand). \n\n{{champion:3}} : He has an amazing ult and amazing utility overall in his kit. The problem is, unlike a Kennen or Wukong, he has no way to ever actually get in range to use his ult. There isn't really much reason to pick him when other champions have easier, more reliable engages. \n\n{{champion:222}}: She has every tool you could possibly want if you were trying to win bot lane while scaling into late game. But without mobility she simply can't do anything about someone like Zed or Yasuo. I know these characters are meant to be her counters but it still feels really stupid to win lane, get to mid/late game, go 100 range too close and get blown up before I can actually do anything in response. \n\n{{champion:77}} : Good luck trying to get in range to fight anyone ever. Udyr used to be one of the top guys for early damage because his Q procs were so strong. Every new champion who comes out with a gap closer weakened him, reducing the number of times where it was viable to pick him. Then Vi came out with obscene early damage of her own, decent jungle sustain, and actual gap closers, and there was no longer any reason to play Udyr. \n\nThis is kind of a short list, and that's intentional. I didn't want to drag out this list too long because there are some immobile champions who are good ({{champion:61}}  because her kit is obscene, {{champion:96}} because he deals so much damage that it's worth protecting him, {{champion:53}} because he just brings you to him) but also because there are so many champions with other issues to deal with in the immobile champion pool and bringing them up just feels like a cheap shot ({{champion:41}} {{champion:82}} {{champion:6}} {{champion:83}}).\n\nTL;DR actions speak louder then words","replies":[]},{"poster":"MickNight","date":"2014-11-12T23:07:56.201+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:236}} {{champion:236}} {{champion:236}} {{champion:236}} {{champion:236}} {{champion:236}} {{champion:236}} {{champion:236}} {{champion:236}} \n\n\"I think the right action on Kallista is make sure she's weaker at other things for having it, personally.\" -Morello 11/12/14\n\n You should change you should change your name to Trololololol. because the same thing was said about this guy {{champion:236}} making that statement best joke NA.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"gubigubi","date":"2014-11-10T23:38:55.344+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly riot needs to be looking at everything creep.

It's because they have more resources and confidence in their ability to execute ideas.  But the old champions are so boring and lame in comparison and it effects power level too for sure.  They should revisit champions like ashe and load up their kit rather than unload the interesting kits imo.  But that has the negative effect of making the huge learning curve even worse.  I think riot is suffering an identity crisis.  I also think if there's too much loaded kits they won't be picking up new players as often.  I play a ton and I'm still confused about all the things thresh does just because he DOES SO MANY THINGS.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Pvt Yong Tai","date":"2014-11-10T21:38:45.490+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Knock Creep as well.

Instead of having the power to instantly move from one place to another, all the time, in any direction (ezreal), they are creating champions that can access their mobility under certain circumstances. This is why we see older champions likes kassidin, and nidalee have much more toxic utility skills than newer champions like yasuo and kalista. Yes these champions can all out play you through dodging and closing the gap, or escape, but unlike the first 2, the latter is only able to when there is a target within a close range of themselves. \n\nAs the game develops and older champions start getting changed, and healthier mobility (and non-mobility) kits are made from reworks, we will see a much more healthier league in terms of mobility. However, as of right now, it is true that champions with Dashes dominate certain categories like for ADC's and mid laners, however, we are starting to see exceptions there as well, aka, twitch, and xerath being very powerful meta champions.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
