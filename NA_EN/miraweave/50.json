Hell, Kalista could *literally* have zero movement speed and still be an incredibly strong kiter. If we made it so that the majority of dashes had their ranges reduced by slows we would have a decent solution to mobility creep, and we'd be able to scale back slow values so that these new slows (which have to be massive in order to mean anything to some highly mobile champ) don't completely destroy any immobile champion they hit.\n\nEDIT: To be clear, this wouldn't affect 'unstoppable' dashes like Malphite ult, and would obviously have to be balanced on a very case-by-case basis. I'm just saying that it would go a long way to fixing mobility creep.\n\nSECOND EDIT: Also, the very short range dashes (at least the ones with actual cooldowns *cough* {{champion:429}}) probably wouldn't be affected because it would completely destroy the champions involved. I'm mainly talking about things like Lucian E, Lee's second Q, Akali's Ult, Kalista's passive, etc.","replies":[]}
