Yes, they die when jumped on, but they have enough poke to make sure that you can't jump on them.

He's strong and has decent burst in his kit with his E, but Ashe and Jhin have so much range on him that they just destroy him. For Ashe, it's a skill matchup between both players in bot lane. If your bot laners are just outright better at their picks than the enemy bot laners, they can win.

The arrow moves fast enough that you can't dodge it from a short distance without instant mobility, so unless you're playing Sivir, Nocturne, have your flash up, or have a QSS, no matter how far ahead you are, Ashe can just ult you and kill you. Even point-blank, it's a 1.5 second stun. If she has her Q stacked up beforehand, you'll be lucky to survive that if you aren't a tank.\n\nAnd, she's the only ADC I can think of off the top of my head that has a stun or something else that prevents you from moving and attacking entirely.

Ashe is not in that half. Neither are Lucian/Ezreal/Corki/Sivir (what we've seen lately) but just because we've previously had one type of \"wrong\" doesn't mean the current is any better (and as a Jinx player that dreaded going against Ashe since I started playing in season 4, I have to say it's worse).","replies":[{"poster":"LankPants","date":"2016-08-31T11:21:59.144+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":">Just like those with mobility need to sacrifice something.\n\nI'm just going to point this out, in general ADCs with mobility sacrifice utility and ADCs with utility sacrifice mobility. There are some exceptions to this, for example Sivir sacrifices range so she can get a bit of both and Kog sacrifices both so he can double down on damage and range but for about 70% of ADCs this is the tradeoff.\n\nAn ADC definitively can't tradeoff damage. One of the core defining traits of ADCs is that they output strong sustained damage through auto attacks. When ADCs can't do this they need an extreme in another form of damage in order to offset this weakness, for example Ezreal's poke damage. \n\nWhen ADCs don't bring any form of applicable damage, as in the case of Ashe prerework and current Kalista (thank fucking god) they are not actually playable, at least in botlane.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Miss Worthless","date":"2016-08-31T07:21:59.175+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, i really like that Ashe is a top-tier ADC atm.\n\n{{champion:107}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"JDB8eoX8x0","date":"2016-08-31T06:15:14.670+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really don't understand why Riot decided that \"Ashe is a utility marksman and shouldn't be stronger than other ADCs\" when really we have Lucian running around with Black Cleaver being an OP utility marksman himself. A really quickly armor shredder is a pretty meaningful tool for a teamfight.\n\nThey should just stop touching Ashe to be honest. She has no tools that can assure her an escape and she can really quickly get gutted by any assassin. They also nerfed Sivir of all champions. Why? She's barely even played anymore. She had a few two patches where she was a god tier ADC because of her W crits, but now most people know how to even counter THAT.\n\nThey don't do some champions their justice and solely because of the LCS. Solely because \"Ashe enables easy kills\" and \"Sivir is a speedbuffer\". Riot gives these ADCs SO much meaning when really they're not half as meaningful outside of the LCS.","replies":[]}]}
