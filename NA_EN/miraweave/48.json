While it makes sense for a bit of armor pen to exist, a build should not exist that can reduce 100 armor to under 10 effective armor, and that build *does* exist. Imagine a hypothetical person with 100 armor, and a hypothetical riven with {{item:3035}} {{item:3071}} {{item:3142}} {{item:3134}}.\r\n\r\nThe armor shred from {{item:3071}} applies first, reducing your 100 armor to 75 armor.\r\nThen LW is applied, ignoring 35% of that 75 armor. 75*0.65 = 48.75.\r\nFinally, we can apply the 6% reduction from the mastery, which puts you at 45.825 armor.\r\n\r\nSo, with two items and one mastery we've already taken off 55% of your armor. But we still have 20 flat pen from {{item:3142}}, 10 from {{item:3071}}, and 10 from {{item:3134}}. Admittedly, you wouldn't be building a brutalizer on top of all that since it doesn't build into anything, but I'm just showing the hypothetical maximum penetration. Those four items add up to 40 flat armor pen, which means that the 45.85 armor after all percentage penetration was factored in, is now just 5.85 armor, or basically nothing. In fact, if this hypothetical riven had armor penetration runes, you would be at zero armor.\r\n\r\nNow, obviously 100 armor isn't that much, so let's try the same build against someone with 250 armor, to get a sense of how well tanks hold up.\r\n\r\n250 Armor * .75 ({{item:3071}}) = 187 Armor\r\n187 Armor * .65 ({{item:3035}}) = 121 Armor\r\n121 Armor * .94 (Mastery) = 114\r\n114 Armor - 40 ({{item:3142}} {{item:3071}} {{item:3134}}) = 74 Armor.\r\n\r\nSo, 250 armor has been reduced to slightly under 74 armor. So she's ignored 176 armor, or 70% of your total armor.\r\n\r\nThat is *way* too much. Even without the extra brutalizer it comes to 64% reduction. Hell, people complain about how powerful AD Carries are with just LW and the mastery, which is only about 39% penetration. I think the basic problem is that while BC and LW are both decent items on their own (LW needs a slight nerf, but that's for another thread), the fact that they stack gives AD Casters who can build them a source of *totally absurd* percentage penetration. Like, just BC shred, LW penetration, and the penetration mastery total at 55% armor penetration. If LW and BC's passives were both unique, a lot of the problems we have with armor feeling completely worthless (especially against casters like Riven, Zed, Lee Sin, etc) would be gone.\r\n\r\n**TL;DR** Make Black Cleaver and Last Whisper unique so that they don't stack with one another, and building armor will feel like it's actually doing something against most AD casters. LW needs a nerf on it's own, but that's a topic for another thread.**","replies":[]}
