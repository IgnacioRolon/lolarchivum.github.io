Ashe does this with a slow and gets completely destroyed by gapclosers. Kalista does it by having a dash on every single autoattack. So Ashe is paying mana and one of her active ability slots for something that is *just worse* than what Kalista has on a passive.\r\n\r\nBoth of them provide utility by way of vision. Ashe gets a short burst of vision, which is at a fairly short range for most of the game. Kalista gets a mobile ward, which can be cast at max range from rank one. The ability Ashe gets her vision from also passively gives her gold, often about 700 by the time the game ends. Kalista's gives her significant %hp damage on a potentially very low cooldown. Yes, gold is nice, but Kalista's W is going to be giving more value most of the time. \r\n\r\nBoth of them provide an initiation. Kalista's is multi-target, acts as a gapcloser for another tanky initiator, is unaffected by Tenacity, can't be cleansed, and has additional utility in it's ability to save an ally from certain death. Ashe's ult does damage and is global.\r\n\r\nSeriously, the only thing I can think of that Ashe does better is that her initiate does damage and can be used globally, even though that almost never matters. Kalista basically does everything that Ashe does but much better than Ashe.","replies":[]}
