The ratio is *already* 50% at max rank, my question is why it scales up at all when the difference between 46% and 50% is totally insignifigant with the low amount of AD he'll have earlier in the game anyway.\n\nThe difference between 46% AD and 50% AD per tick on the rank one ability is less than 4 damage per tick.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"RiotRepertoir","date":"2015-08-17T00:38:50.782+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's just the balance we fell on, really.

It's totally insignificant at early levels and it's already 50% by the time the change in ratio actually matters. That's the point I'm making.\n\nIf it were 46% at all ranks I'd understand that they wanted to reduce the lategame damage. But increasing the ratio per rank by 1% when the thing is maxed by level 9 doesn't make any sense. The difference between 46% AD per tick and 50% AD per tick at early levels would barely do anything, and by the time you have enough AD that it would, the ratio is going to be like 49% so it still doesn't matter.","replies":[{"poster":"The Fast","date":"2015-08-16T23:21:04.203+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Meh.
