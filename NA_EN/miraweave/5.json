Probably some inaccurate examples, but thats generally what its aimed for.\n\nStat wise, the item is fine; the active damage is pretty crazy though, I'm surprised they didn't just make it apply a flat damage regardless of # of bolts hit, and then a DoT that scales with AP (since you know its well..... fire lol), make the projectiles spread over a wider area to maximize its active effect; without the damage being absolutely absurd.","replies":[{"poster":"Smeckledorf","date":"2016-10-18T05:30:17.817+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As someone who plays Swain, I think that Swain needs compensation buffs if this item gets removed.

Since nothing had been done to Protobelt, I assumed it was because these were not the intended champions, but then none of the champions were being worked on... So it left me confused as to who it was intended for, its too strong on the group that is building it.  \n\nSwain is the only champion I have seen build this who doesn't have any mobility in their kit. However we need to ask ourselves, do we want to give Swain the ability to dash into a teamfight? Is he not balanced with the idea in mind that he needs to run into the enemies in order to maximize his effectiveness and that puts him at risk of being CC'd or his enemies escaping? Doesn't this item sort of negate a lot of the weaknesses of Swain while at the same time amplifying his strengths?   \n\nSo again I am confused, because I don't think champions like Swain and Kennen should be building this item. They are balanced around not having the ability to dash into a team and to suddenly give them this ability creates a ton of issues (not so much with Swain). I don't think Protobelt should take the place of rebalancing them, becoming completely dependent on an item is not great balance. Synergy with an item is good, but complete dependence is not. It is why Mordekaiser will be effected extremely hard by any Rylai's changes, because he is completely reliant on that item. We don't want protobelt effecting Kennen and Swain like it is.
