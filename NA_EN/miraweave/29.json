But doubling on-hits just shouldn&#039;t be that upgrade. It&#039;s power level is too closely tied to what abilities it can be abused with, and that&#039;s not really an effect that should exist. The closest item to it in that regard is Lich Bane, but even that&#039;s much more reasonable.","replies":[]}
