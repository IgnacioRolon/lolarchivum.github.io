The singed player that I beat in lane who goes on to be kind of useless, will be the one who trades well, tries to zone me, wards, and plays intelligently.\r\n\r\nThe singed player who somehow ends up absolutely dominating the game will be the singed player who pops ghost at level three and runs under my tower, takes three tower hits while spamming laugh, and then recalls and teleports to a ward directly next to his tower instead of to his tower. The singed player who pops ult for no reason right before recalling. The singed player who dives four towers deep 11 minutes into the game and somehow gets out.\r\n\r\nI don't get it, does singed require a very high amount of negative skill to do well, or something? Or do singed players just play so erratically that even they can't predict what they're doing to do next?","replies":[]}
