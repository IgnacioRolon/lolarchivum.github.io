If you pick up defensive items that give cdr, you end up with a super low cooldown on your E since it scales well with cdr given it&#039;s flat reduction. Q is a multi-hit so BC stacks a bit faster, and you get more tank stats from your passive anyway.\r\n\r\nSo far it seems pretty fun.","replies":[]}
