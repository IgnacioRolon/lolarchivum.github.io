The trouble is that so many champions are forced to take exhaust/ignite/heal/etc, which are all almost totally combat related and offer no real strategic value except \"is it off cooldown\"?\r\n\r\nTele has *so much potential* to do really really cool things in ways the other spells just don't, and I think it's a real shame to not give everyone access to it. If it were a (reasonably expensive) boot enchant rather than a summoner spell, it would open up the option for people who can't usually take Teleport since they need to have a combat spell to have access to the strategic mobility that Teleport provides, and I really don't see how that would make the game anything but better.","replies":[]}
