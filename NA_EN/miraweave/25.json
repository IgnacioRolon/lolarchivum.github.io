She's never going to be a top tier soloqueue champion since she's heavily team reliant, but she's solid if her team supports her. Several of her hardest matchups happen to be top-tier right now, too. When Cass/Viktor/Azir/Rylais get nerfed she'll be a lot better.","replies":[{"poster":"Sightless66","date":"2016-07-30T17:34:37.441+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":2,"body":">When Cass/Viktor/Azir/Rylais get nerfed she'll be a lot better.\n\nI'm inclined to disagree. She's been out of the meta for quite a bit, well before any of them (except Azir) were major things. Even with team support, she's not preforming very well. I think she's going to need some help before she's competitive again.","replies":[]},{"poster":"NotCounter","date":"2016-08-01T01:17:37.603+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"shouldn't orianna be good against viktor just like cass... since her short Q cooldown and empowered autos give her a dps advantage?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Sire Hippington","date":"2016-07-30T22:11:40.118+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think all she needs are QoL buffs, especially the one that has been requested for ages: Let allies who carrie her ball see how far they can move from her befor it snaps back.\nAditionally, it would be nice if the ball couldn't snap back duering the ult animation, and if it would snap back with a 0.5-1sec delay, so leaving the range very briefly doesn't imidiatly cause the ball to return to ori.\n\nOri mostly is held back by how easy it is to fail the ult combo because that malph or whoever had the ball ults slightly to far away from her.","replies":[{"poster":"Sevixys","date":"2016-07-31T10:39:35.798+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes..
