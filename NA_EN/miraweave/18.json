He has no all-in single target burst combo like talon or zed. He has a lot of multi target damage and a shitload of mobility that puts most conventional assassins to shame. In fact, I would argue that yasuo has more in-fight mobility than any other champ in the game (kassadin and kalista are the only champs that MIGHT compete with him, but they don't nearly have his damage potential, nor his cc). His damage is more along the lines of a true dps whereas assassins are defined by their heavy burst and the ease with which they can get to their targets. As mobile as yasuo is, he does have to weave his e through either minions or other champions to get to the back line (unless he can get off an ult with allied knock ups). He fills a very similar role to tryndamere, he just relies more on finesse and more utility instead of tankiness (from undying rage) and healing.","replies":[{"poster":"Jet Sett","date":"2016-06-18T23:11:18.212+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":6,"body":"Kalista is far more mobile than Yasuo, his mobility is tied to minions for the more outrageous moments but that isn't as consistent as her's. Also, Yasuo has enough burst to kill squishy targets relatively quickly, doesn't matter whether it's instant burst or high dps, if you kill quick and consistently, you're an assassin. Twitch and Tristana are labeled as assassins for the same reasons.\n\nNow, this part has nothing to do with you specifically, this is just a general question; Are we back to the Yasuo \"circlejerk\" as it's called? He's not the most frustrating thing to go against mid lane, and he's not overpowered, so why are we back to this?","replies":[{"poster":"MonkeyMadness","date":"2016-06-18T23:45:31.424+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":1,"body":"Because hes been getting pretty oppressive in the top lane lately.\n\nAlso, \n>doesn't matter whether it's instant burst or high dps, if you kill quick and consistently, you're an assassin.\n\n{{champion:1}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:45}} #leagueofassassins\nWhile I agree that yasuo does have assassin-esque characteristics (as do trist and twitch) he's NOT a true assassin. He's a fighter (I would be more specific and call him a melee adc, as fighter seems a bit too non-specific) but still. True assassins are zed and talon and champs like that. High mobility and VERY single target oriented. The issue with yasuo is that he has assassin mobility and assassin damage WITHOUT the assassin target restrictions. He is effective against tanks, he is good at getting to the backline, and he can put down decent aoe damage AND rapidly switch targets mid fight. Assassins tend to be incredibly useless if their primary target manages to escape the initial burst. He's just too well rounded in the hands of a good player to be a fair fight.\n\nAnd the feast or famine thing you mentioned earlier really isn't the same for yasuo. It's more \"outplay or get outplayed\". Now before you tell me that this is the case with literally any champ (which is correct) let me qualify it a bit. If you are getting outplayed by virtually any other champion, there are logic counter play styles/items that you can build to stop the bleeding. And if you are outplaying your enemy, they can play a certain way in order to counter you. With yasuo, you either crush your opponent relentlessly with 0 opportunity for counterplay, or you get crushed with 0 opportunity for counterplay. That is the true definition of a broken champion.","replies":[{"poster":"Jet Sett","date":"2016-06-19T00:03:48.437+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well I thank you for being civil the whole way through this conversation and apologize for my unruly attitude when attempting (and failing it seems) to retort.

Knock-up immunity for 10 seconds after he last used it on you. For an ability that is available so often and with such a constant threat it should not be able to knock you up every single time it's available. The width of it is deceptive too because I have been hit numerous times when I see myself past it to the sides.\n2. His shield cannot recharge if he has taken champion damage in the last 2 seconds and resets every time he takes champion damage before it fills up. Before people go \"NO\" to this it's worth pointing out that every time Aurelion Sol takes damage his long range dash counter resets to 0.\n\nConsidering he still has his near infinite dash, double crit, frequent knock-up and a walking shield something has to go. I know he can only dash through the same target once every X seconds but tell me, when was the last time you got away from a Yasuo in lane with minions around? I can't be the only one that is actually close to getting away and then a new minion wave from your side comes to aid his bullshittery.\n\nRiot will never admit it but he cannot be balanced by number changes alone. He will either be OP or trash tier at all times with no middle ground. Hit his kit, I don't care if it changes his identity. Yasuo mains will care but I would think they would prefer a champion in a state where he can be played and his performance is based on skill instead of an abusive kit. I saw a brief bit of the LCS yesterday and I was pretty pissed at one of the players. In his interview he was saying that the nerfs to Ekko were too much! That is utter bullshit and he knows it. What he really meant was the nerfs to Ekko stopped him being super OP so they can't abuse him any more. Boofuckinghoo.

He's hard to burst down because he gets 100% crit from 2 items, which means he has way more item slots available to build defensively.\n\nIf any other champion sans tryndamere wants 100% crit, their build looks like this:\n{{item:3087}} {{item:3046}} {{item:3031}} {{item:3508}}, which means in your remaining 2 slots you need to choose between boots, armor pen, and a defensive item. Meaning you're either going to be squishy AF, slow AF, or do no damage to tanks (AF?). Oh, and they have no lifesteal.\n\nYasuo gets to build this: {{item:3087}} {{item:3031}} {{item:3111}} {{item:3072}} {{item:3156}} {{item:3026}} and get 100% crit, lifesteal, a maw and a GA, and still do a lot of damage to tanks thanks to his 50% bonus arpen on ult.","replies":[{"poster":"ZT Xperimentor","date":"2016-06-18T22:23:24.186+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Those I'm already well aware of masteries & runes only being parts of it; but I agree it's more of how many items he gets to abuse as well.","replies":[{"poster":"Imperial Japan","date":"2016-06-19T06:37:59.728+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Many other champions can abuse items that synergises highly with them as well.
