My question is, does the price in RP get reduced if I own both the champion and the skin? I have Mecha Kha'Zix on sale in my Snowdown sale and I was thinking of grabbing it for the chromas.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-20T22:23:15.397+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yep! Those bundles should all, by design, be discounted depending on which items you already own. If for some reason you think it's not giving you the right discount, hit up our billing agents in a ticket and they can double check and correct any issues that might have happened!","replies":[]}]}
