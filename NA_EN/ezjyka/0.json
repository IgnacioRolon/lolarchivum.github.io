This doesn't for some reason include club buttons, and I am even able to open chats with friends in the same clubs as me. I tried repairing my files, but the problem persisted, then I tried running as administrator and finally reinstalling the game, but it still seems to crash, even sometimes when I only hover my mouse over icons. Everything else on my PC is perfectly normal, so I really have no clue what happened to my client. Please help me fix this issue!","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-03T03:58:25.816+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since all of those buttons cause your client to request data from the servers, I'd imagine this is caused by a network disconnection from that the servers. I'd recommend working through our [connection guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues), as it will likely help resolving this.\n\nLet me know if those steps helped.","replies":[]}]}
