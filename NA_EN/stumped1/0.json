I made this because it's way easier for me to find champs. \n\nFor example, you can search for a champ name and immediately see all the heroes who synergize with that champ. Also try clicking on say, multiple champs in a row.\n\nRight now this does not have the items in it. I'm working on adding that, perhaps in a ^ formation (like an L shape but rotated 45 degrees).\n\nAnyway, please let me know on what I can improve on!","replies":[{"poster":"Infernape","date":"2019-07-07T18:27:54.986+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"The only thing that it needs is the items and it's perfect","replies":[{"poster":"Stumped1","date":"2019-07-07T18:50:09.403+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yep, I'm working on it. I'm imagining it having a feature where you click on the 2nd tier item and it'll highlight the two items needed for it. It's super different from the hero synergies though so I can't leverage code from it","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Caitlyn FTW","date":"2019-07-06T19:54:25.219+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Stumped1","date":"2019-07-06T20:03:17.089+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No... it's secured by an https certificate by Amazon.
