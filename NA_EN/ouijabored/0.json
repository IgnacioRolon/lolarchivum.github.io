I am bronze 4 btw.\n\nI was always under the impression that everyone thought teemo was an OP bastard.\nContrary to my belief, every single time I have picked teemo I get flamed at by my own team for picking someone &quot;so useless&quot; or someone will all chat from the other team laughing at my pick.... 9/10 I slaughter them and/or carry the game out. For example last game I got flamed for picking teemo into pantheon (which yes I know he is his counter but I for some reason don&#039;t always find a problem with path for him and I&#039;m also on a mission to get mastery 7 with teems so I was going to play him in draft regardless) I proceeded to carry out that game with a score of 23/8/10 with three of my counters on the other side (yasuo, Malph, and panth) \n\nCan someone please explain where this hate came from and how come I can&#039;t seem to understand what people mean... every time I use him I have such great success. He&#039;s great at stopping DPS from adcs, he&#039;s great at punishing people out of position, he&#039;s great at denying CS to the top laner.. he has fucking free wards that do damage like plz someone explain","replies":[{"poster":"Could not care","date":"2016-09-29T19:52:49.971+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"...lately?\n\nNo one has ever liked Teemo except those who play it.\n\nAs a support main, there are not many champs I'd dislike on my team more than Teemo. I literally have to pray to God that the enemy toplaner will lose hard, stay in lane the whole game and will have no efficient waveclear. \n\nTeemo is a great champ in lane. I can't argue about it. But outside of it... he's pretty useless. If you can abuse your advantage to the max and get out of lane far ahead - great! If not... well 4v5s are not my taste . So, I would much prefer to see a champ that is good even when he goes equal or behind and would have some teamfighting potential, as then even if he goes behind we could salvage the game as a group.\n\nEdit: Also, you're at bronze 4. AFAIK the people there aren't the most calm and tolerant ones.","replies":[{"poster":"OuijaBored","date":"2016-09-29T20:00:57.402+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Playing devils advocate here because I totally understand your point 100% \n\nIf teemo switches to an ADC play style and stays in the back and offers a blind to the teams adcs and also offers DOT with his autos would it still be a 4v5? Is your arguement more towards the fact that he's not a tank and unable to withstand late game power?? There's builds to counter that problem! Although not as good as full AP teemo, tankmo can still offer the blind and DOT to team fights for a couple of rotations without having to flee towards your back line. \n\nSometimes I believe it really comes down to the teemo player themselves and their abiltiy to adapt to different situations and struggle to stay relevant. A well placed shroom can change the tide of a teamfight or even catch out that guy running off to the side to save himself!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CerealBoxOfDoom","date":"2016-09-29T20:03:38.856+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=StauroliteFae,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=WlKQfY26,comment-id=,timestamp=2016-09-29T19:34:04.488+0000)\n>\n> I just recently found the joys of being a satanic little hamster of tilt\n\nthere's nothing new about it, you just weren't walking in the shoes of a teemo player before. \n\nYou've walked down a long dark path and should probably turn around before its too late\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKyEbjcvUag","replies":[{"poster":"OuijaBored","date":"2016-09-29T20:05:54.432+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I LOVE THE SONG CHOICEEEE!!!! <3 \n\n\nAlso..

Champions nowadays have some kind utility towards teamfight or splitpushing, whereas Teemo is mostly good at AAing single targets 1v1.\n\nHe's good don't get me wrong, but you would never see him played in an LCS match or in higher ELO play because he's really easy to shut down/beat, and doesn't offer much to the team outside of his minefields. \n\nBut don't let that stop you from playing him :) If you honestly enjoy playing Teemo then go for it! I personally like playing him in the jungle, even though he has no initation or utility :P I end up being more of a global ward with traps in the enemy jungle, super fun haha.","replies":[{"poster":"OuijaBored","date":"2016-09-29T20:02:59.020+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree 100% I think I'm going to try teemo jungle!! \nThank you for being positive about keeping on with my teemo journey!","replies":[{"poster":"Desolas Arterius","date":"2016-09-29T20:16:44.424+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Haha no problem!

I prefer Stalker's but that's up to you. \nCore items will be {{item:3151}} {{item:3116}} and {{item:3085}} . All else is situational. Boots are always {{item:3020}} . \n\nFor starting in the jungle I highly recommend going with Q and starting Krugs. The stun + blind really helps you clear camps considering how squishy you are. \n\nI suggest doing Krugs, Red, and the Scuttle for that extra heal and vision. Move to blue and get Gromp, Blue, and the other Scuttle if you have enough health. Basic jungle strat is good for him, just be careful on your health and possible invades. \n\nGanking you don't need to worry about, but only gank if the enemy is over extending and your ally has a good form of CC. \n\nYou'll mostly want to focus on laying your shrooms in good locations (pushes and paths frequently traveled) and you'll want to ward a lot for your team. You wont be able to provide good ganks, but you can really help your team by creating a lot of vision. Pinks and your trinket ward work just fine with your shrooms. \n\nI hope that helps :D He's super fun to play in the jungle. And that build/runes/masteries works for top as well. \n\nGood luck!","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Critmaster Garen","date":"2016-09-29T19:59:35.794+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lately.\n\nthats funny. hes been despised since the first days of this game. if youve ever seen the phases where he was a regular pick youd understand why.\n\nhis kit is uninteractive as fuck. it lacks counterplay (no sweeper at lvl 9 on a 90 second cooldown is not a viable form of counterplay). he is opressive as hell in lane against a lot of matchups. he drags out games. his lategame is nothing but splitpushing.\n\npeople hate having him on his team, because most teemos are fucking useless. and people hate playing against him because even winning against him feels like a constant uphill battle and like a chore.","replies":[{"poster":"OuijaBored","date":"2016-09-30T00:09:49.655+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I only say lately because I have never seen the hate before; I was unaware it was an ongoing thing to think he was useless.. the only thing I had ever seen before I used him was people talking about how annoying he is to verse.
