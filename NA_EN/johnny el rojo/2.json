But u gotta keep in mind that they wanted to stay away from \"the 2 in one\" theme since they just did Kayn recently. Additionally they do like to put their own spin on things. Only this time they may have spun a bit too far out the the theme's general region. Some interactions or more quotes towards the suit would helped as would the suit having more independent motions.\n\nThe thing that makes it hard to convey the theme of the symbiot is that the Voidling is basically a vegetable, and she has almost full control over it, except for it needing to eat... so that makes the options for what the suit can do to show that it is in a symbiotic relationship pretty narrow.\n\nThats kinda the catch 22 with Kai'sa and its unfortunate.","replies":[{"poster":"MuffledGarbage","date":"2018-04-27T03:45:25.202+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot could have made the suit flash different colors based on Kai'Sa health(high purple, moderate blue, low red)\n\nRiot could have made the suit move in noticeable fashions on it's own(which would have solved the \"Kai'Sa looks like a cosplayer\" issue)\n\nRiot could have had the suit Spit out debris every once-in-a-while in order to show that it's excreting(yes, void poop.

It defends Eddie, it completely encases Eddie when in combat, and it displays highly organic appendages that it uses in combat. Kai'sa's suit looks completely inorganic, and the moving parts are strange plates, that again look inorganic. The weapons her suit makes for her are crystal guns?
