Please help","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"So I&#039;ve recently finished a match against intermediate bots and got destroyed. It&#039;s been like this basically throughout every game I&#039;ve played and I&#039;m a little tired of it. I know I&#039;m new to league and MOBAs in general, but I definitely think I&#039;m worse than most when they first start off. Whether I am or not, I&#039;m asking for help. I want to get into good habits early on, so I would love for someone to try and help. Anything I should be doing every game or any general advice would be greatly appreciated. If you even want to go as far as playing with me then that is also helpful and probably the best way to help out. Someone please help :)","replies":[{"poster":"EinarUlfar","date":"2017-05-13T08:30:04.899+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"YouTube, some High Elo streamers, & lots of experience are all nice (:","replies":[{"poster":"RedTurtle","date":"2017-05-13T11:22:52.050+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the thing with watching high elo plays is that sometimes i don't understand what's going on and why they're making certain decisions","replies":[{"poster":"EinarUlfar","date":"2017-05-17T02:07:32.371+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When you watch them, ask yourself why they would do that (and watch what the result of their action(s) is).
