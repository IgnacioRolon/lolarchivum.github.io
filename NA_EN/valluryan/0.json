Each time within 24 hours my ticket disappears and I receive no answer, and no fix to the problem and missing capsule. Is Riot deleting my tickets and simply refusing to offer customer service??? I can submit a 3rd ticket for the exact same thing, but not sure if they'll just delete it again without bothering to respond or fix THEIR problem.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-29T05:54:27.089+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's pretty weird. Your first ticket was sent only yesterday, and your second was sent in today. Both were answered today, and the capsule was added already. Strange that you weren't seeing any responses.","replies":[{"poster":"Valluryan","date":"2017-11-29T22:31:34.042+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you, I received the capsule in my inventory last night. And I'm sorry for the frustrated response. I'm not sure what was going on with the system, but those were the 2nd and 3rd tickets I submitted, for some reason the 1st one sent a day or so before those still never showed up - unless there was a problem with my connection and it didn't actually send it through. For some reason I only had access to view that 2nd ticket yesterday after submitting the last one. Even now if I click on \"Support\" --> \"My Tickets\" it just brings up a blank page. The way it worked last night was to click \"My activity\" after submitting the other ticket, and it showed the 2nd one and other previous tickets I've submitted. I'm using Chrome, but possibly it's just a problem with the browser.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-30T02:18:58.738+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We have been seeing some issues with the ticket site recently, so it was probably just that.
