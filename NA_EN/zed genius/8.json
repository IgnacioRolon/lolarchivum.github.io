It&#039;s just something a lot of people have been saying now. Nb3 as most of u know said he will quit the game, solwolf who even though makes no more videos said he uninstalled recently etc.A lot of people have been quitting the game this season, especially with fortnite coming out. Is like the reason for this that people like FN more than League? If that&#039;s the case then we don&#039;t have to worry about it because I&#039;d put money that Fortnite hype will have died out by summer. But what if it isn&#039;t? I genuinely want to know if people think League is dying or if it&#039;s just another circlejerk like every other year.","replies":[]}
