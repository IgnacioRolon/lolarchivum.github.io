I don&#039;t mean the clone casting the same ability stuff, nor the RR combo for that matter, but having it work like heimer&#039;s ult where u ult and then choose the ability u want to use and not just have it cast the ability previously casted feels so much better.I have played both versions of LB quite a bit and I just thought I&#039;d put that out there","replies":[{"poster":"Glory97","date":"2018-03-23T13:31:31.149+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":2,"body":"The reworked ultimate is problematic because it allows you to pretty much always have a dash available to escape ganks. With how the old ultimate works, if you go in w, q for a trade you have no dash available for 10 sec.

If you went for w into someone with cc you just got stunned and chunked. Cause they just hit you mid dash. Especially after the dash speed Nerf.

Before you only had access to one ability at any given time. So combos were more limiting.
