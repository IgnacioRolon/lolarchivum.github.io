I succeeded going a low AD rageblade/high AS tank Vayne top lane. My reasoning was - I increase the proportion of true damage, meaning I need less physical damage to do damage. It worked out well. Then I tried it jungle, not so much because of the invades and low income... and suddenly I'm a troll. A Mundo went PD tank in that same game, he's a troll too although I can see what he was doing, coz it made sense.\n\nThere are even subtler ways of trolling, like a person who posted a Cait intentionally just walking around in teamfights and that OP was wondering why they were losing every single good engage until they found out her damage to champs was roughly 3k (post-game). There has to be intent when trolling, not all strange builds/playstyles are trolls.\n\nHowever, if one went AP Riven, that would be pretty hard to justify which probably means the intent to troll was there (troll as in make your team angry, not doing something strange and trying to win with it).","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"EkyonKun","date":"2017-09-10T02:23:36.265+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"I remember taking Annie top (do it all the time) and while I was 0/0/0, my team was 3/13 or something crazy like that by the 10 minute mark.

The latter is unequivocally trolling, because even if he buys sup items and doesn't steal his adc's farm, he'll be the most useless champion ever: not utilities, no cc, not enough farm/kills to actually hurt the enemies, nothing at all.

Yasuo bot isn't that unfounded, and neither is Orianna, but that's not what you were trying to point out. The fact that she played as a carry rather than support doesn't make her a troll either, though. Yasuo bot tends to be highly risky, and if it falls behind, the Yasuo tends to have trouble farming. In that case, it's actually a good strategy to have the \"support\" be ready to play more like a carry: taking the farm that the Yasuo can't reach, and providing extra all-in power so the lane can snowball easier (not buying sightstone).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Raiyza","date":"2017-09-10T12:52:57.915+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's nothing wrong with picking a non meta champion.
