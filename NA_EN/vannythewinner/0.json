Many times, players are punished by other players in queue and there is no way to let Riot know of these toxic players without sitting through an entire game with them.  An example:\r\n\r\nMy friend and I queued up for ranked as the lowly bronze and silver players we are.  Immediately after selecting our desired champions, I was flamed for intending on playing Urgot top.  Though considered weak by many, this choice still did not warrant the toxicity.  My champion was then banned out from under me by a team mate.  Our support, who was queued up with this other player, then stole my friends champion out from under him and claimed he was our new mid.  To conclude, the player who banned my top claimed we were trash and deserved to lose, locking in as Singed jungle and claiming he was feeding.\r\n\r\nIn the current system, the only options available for players are to dodge the queue to avoid these players, losing LP and taking a time penalty, or suffering through an entire game. losing even more LP and having a negative experience.  If there were some form of reporting for in queue behavior, these players may finally be brought a bit of justice and will no longer be able to go, and I quote, &quot;tyler1 one on you bronzies&quot;","replies":[{"poster":"broccoflauer","date":"2017-08-05T23:13:55.485+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Seconded.","replies":[]}]}
