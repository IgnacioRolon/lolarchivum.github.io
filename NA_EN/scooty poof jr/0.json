Please explain how that works.","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] General Discussion","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"How exactly does it work out to be at all fair, when from the start of a game, someone is AFK. We lose the game 4v5, and I'm demoted afterwards? How the FUCK, exactly is that at all fair? You mean to tell me, that I got no consideration to the fact that somebody left the game, and forced me to play with a crippled team? \r\n\r\nCome on Riot. That's messed up! How do you not have a system in place to be sure that people who get the short end of the stick in ranked games where their teammates quit or afk, don't lose as much LP as they would have had the player not been afk or quit. . . Honestly I don't think anyone should lose LP for that, and the LP gained should either be decreased or eliminated as well. \r\n\r\nMy bet is that this is a pointless post, and I bet I won't even get as much as a glance from Riot. But I'm sure that new skin releases on time next week, which will be set to make them a few more millions. And it's cool, cause I'm a stupid gamer who will continue to dish out money to the company that doesn't care to read my concerns =D\r\n\r\nGood day","replies":[]}
