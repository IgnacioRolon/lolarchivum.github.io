I ended up in que and while during champ select i told my team i was going to dodge because i felt this game was 100% garbage. While I did that... guess what, every player on my team agreed. Oh snaps. for real? people also feel the same way? people that play this game also feel this game is garbage? haha  you&#039;d say  it&#039;s easy to walk away but yet if you have invested any time into your account, invested any money into your account you&#039;d know that it isnt easy to walk away. \r\n\r\nHow about we say we make this game better?  To some the human aspect i bet is a major part of their entertainment here but i bet majority of the community base i bet would feel that if we could aid the error of the human aspect of the game that&#039;d be great. \r\n\r\nLet&#039;s eliminate chat 100% - no point of chat unless over voice chat to be honest. typing is an easy way to be toxic, lets voice chat. i bet you wont talk shit to me there, why? because the actual human connection we&#039;d have.\r\n\r\nLet&#039;s find a way to eliminate smurfs. sure i bet it&#039;s fun if you are a higher level player to drop back to a lower level to crap on a team but guess who that isn&#039;t fun for....? the 9 other people in that game. it is absolutely horrible... i&#039;ve been on a team with a higher rank teammate and he went like 30 -0 and carried the game and got us a victory but I still felt horrible. because why? it isn&#039;t fracking fair.\r\n\r\nItem suggestion per champion.... that shit isn&#039;t even right. i guess you can set custom build??? i dont know but guess what the suggested builds don&#039;t even work on some champs and don&#039;t make sense this can hurt a lot of new players or players that haven&#039;t even played for a while but are of higher rank.  \r\n\r\nsick of the way this game has been and is being updated. it has become boring and mundane. I legit feel the only reason i play lately is for the competitiveness of the game and i&#039;m starting to see this particular game isn&#039;t worth it and there are many more games out there to satisfy my urge.","replies":[]}
