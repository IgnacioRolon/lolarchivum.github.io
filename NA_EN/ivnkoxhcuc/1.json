My mom has been taking care of me (Whether it&#039;s Dr.&#039;s appointments, going to the store for me, driving me around, etc etc etc) for about 8 months now (Car accidents OP) \r\n\r\nAND after telling her nonstop to apply for jobs, she had been.\r\n\r\nFor 3+ months, and she was starting to lose hope. Last week she had a job interview for a school district (She works with special needs kids). They never called her back Friday (They told her they would.) \r\n\r\nAND IN THE MIDDLE OF MY RANKED MATCH!!!! My mom sent me a text &quot;I got the job&quot; She was super excited! I was super ecstatic for her (We won the ranked match, so that was a double whoop)\r\n\r\nI just wanted to share the good news, I&#039;m happy for my mum.\r\n\r\n#ShareThePositive","replies":[]}
