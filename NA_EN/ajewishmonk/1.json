Try manually enabling the filter as well through your directory:\n\n- Close League of Legends\n- Go to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\RADS\\projects\\lol_air_client\\releases\\(lat est version)\\deploy\\preferences\n- Open up the shared(summoner name).PROPERTIES file up with Notepad\n- It should say:\n[Chat]\nEnableChatFilter=1\n- Just change the 1 to a 0. Hit Ctrl+S to save it.\n\nLet me know if that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"AjewishMonk","date":"2017-03-16T05:38:03.147+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"so when i go there i get a screen full of code. i hit Ctrl+F to find enable and and put =0 after it. still not fixed i can paste the wall of text from the properties if you want","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-16T15:23:55.441+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for trying!
