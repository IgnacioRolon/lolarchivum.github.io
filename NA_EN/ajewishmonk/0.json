It does seem like some kind of unstable connection getting to the game server.  Running a traceroute is fine, but I suggest using [WinMTR ](http://winmtr.net/winmtr-v0-92-now-available/)instead of cmd.   You'll want to route to 104.160.131.1 if you're playing on NA.  \n\nIf you end up running into more high ping and packet loss, then run through each step of our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide.  This will help rule out possibilities with local and setting problems specific to your case.
