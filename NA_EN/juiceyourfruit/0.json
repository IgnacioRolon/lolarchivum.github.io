I use Cable-One ISP and am in Northern Arizona. I have tried all of the methods i can imagine to fix my ping but to no avail. I am running win8 64bit, with a custom laptop with nvidia 980 graphics and an i7, clearly my pc is not the problem (plus i running much harder games via processing power with no problems what so ever. Now, i was wondering if i could be steered in the right direction to fix this problem. I know my ISP is not the problem as other games with servers based all over the board are running just fine never with more than 100 ping. In league of legends i sit at 67 ping at the very beginning, which then becomes random intermittent spikes (seemingly in the worst times possible) of 200-300 ping, and then after roughly the 20 minute mark of the game it may jump into the 700 ping range and even disconnect me from the server for about 1-2 minutes. As you can imagine this is unacceptable during a ranked match and hence i am here trying to work with you to fix this problem. Ill be waiting on your response","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-25T01:46:32.479+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Changes in latency are typically caused by routing issues to the server along your ISP's infrastructure.
