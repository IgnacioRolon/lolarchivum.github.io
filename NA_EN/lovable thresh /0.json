I fell deeply in love with all the Champions and learning the mechanics of the game when i first started, However i feel like this company could care less about it’s community and game with that being said I've been permanently banned on this account twice now so if you wanna invalidate this post and write me off as toxic i wouldn't blame you or hate you for it, although I feel my first ban was well deserved due to how reactionary i was when people verbally harassed me because of my lack of drive to grind any higher than silver 2, my philosophy was that no matter how high I got on the ranked ladder i was still trash you hear the same repetitive garbage no matter how high in rank you are if you’re gold you’re trash because you are not plat, if you are plat you are trash for not being diamond, If you’re D4 then you’re better off killing yourself, No point in grinding rank when you’re still gonna get verbally abused for it, I figured that playing norms and actually having fun with the game is the best way to play the VIDEO GAME. I got banned a second time for expressing that the ranking system is garbage and that I have no desire to grind rank (This was in response to a nocturne player asking to duo with me but Riot really could care less about the context of which you get banned for.) https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JTyxkMj19wanCkOS32bSFmYYljqLpRB-5BIZ5YmclNc/edit?usp=sharing\r\n\r\nWith that being said I don't want to return to this game because of the toxic community and how hollow this company feels this post isn’t about getting my account back, The reason why I am making this post is to highlight Riot’s incompetence and hypocrisy when it comes to dealing with their overall toxic mentality. \r\nExample 1:( “Competitive Bsing is fine as long as you don’t use slurs” )\r\nIf this was really the case I wouldn't have gotten banned the first time competitive bsing is fine unless you ignore all the context to it. \r\nExample 2: (Banning accounts doesn’t Reform players it makes them more angry and Repressed)\r\nI don't understand how Riot expects to “Reform” players by taking away accounts that people have spent 100's of dollars on, but my assumption is riot doesn’t want to fix their punishment system by having actual people look into what’s happening in game &amp; in chat because they make to much money off of people buying skins to actually care about what happens with the game. I've known players that have had their account perma banned over 7 times cause of how reactionary they were to other players that were more toxic than me and this guy combined.\r\nExample 3: https://kotaku.com/over-150-riot-employees-walk-out-to-protest-forced-arbi-1834566198\r\nNot only are you banning away people’s accounts without context cause you guys are sensitive to words and constructive criticism but a select few of you are literally sexually harassing your FEMALE employees. (whoops can’t talk about that Forced Arbitration exists but i don't work for rito so :3)\r\nExample 4: “Skins get Wins” \r\nI Exclusively play on PBE now (not very often) and lemme tell you what, you can really see the problems with how Riot is making this game more around cosmetics than actually fixing bugs or adding important balance changes,Riot seems more focused on making as much money as possible with the pro scene and skins which is what you expect from a COMPANY but when that bleeds over into a video game I am so passionate about it gets me visibly upset since corporations &amp; Companies get away with too much bullsh*t  without any regulation. everything about Riot Games is pro corporation to its very core from it’s technical player support to how they deal with reforming players. I’ve interacted with a Riot employee on twitter a couple months back when i first got banned to ask where the line was because I felt as if I was unfairly banned and I even told him I didn't want my account back i just wanted to extrapolate where the line was, It’s okay to get verbally abused every game and not defend yourself? ”  I totally get you being frustrated man :/ I know you said that context matters but the honest fact is, regardless of the context, its not okay to say these things. Negativity does not excuse negativity” I’d like to end this post by saying thank you to all the players I've interacted with on this game that have genuinely treated me with kindness and respect i’ll never forget the interactions and conversations I've had with all of you that didn’t judge my skill based on my rank and judged me based on the content of my character, I would also like to thank the select few Riot employees that we’re cooperative and understanding with me.
