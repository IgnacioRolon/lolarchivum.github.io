I noticed that champion textures and the minions were a shade darker than normal. I was playing Azir and noticed right away that his coloring was rusty yellow instead of the shining golden he usually is. I don&#039;t know if this was intended, my settings, or a bug that just showed up but I thought to report it anyways. I&#039;ve also included a screenshot of the way it looks on my screen.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-04-03T19:42:55.249+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hiya! \n\nFirst off, thanks for the report!
