In this case, it's possible that the patcher isn't able to locate the file needed to boot up the update.  Try the following steps to repair that portion of your directory.\n\n- Navigate to your League of Legends installation folder. (Typically C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends)\n- Scroll down until you find \"LeagueClient.exe\" and delete the file.\n- Open the client by using \"lol.launcher.admin.exe\"\n- Repair the client by selecting the “?” button in the top right-hand corner of the Patcher window (the first window that appears) and under the options menu, select Repair.\n\nLet me know if this helps.","replies":[]}]}
