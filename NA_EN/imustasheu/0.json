Anyway long story short i was at work got home wanting to play league. \r\n\r\nTried to log in when the game says \"Your account has transferred to another region. Please try logging in to the appropriate region.\"\r\n\r\n Now i'm in NA and have been since Season 4 (that's when i started) and I've never had anyone else log into my account. So instantly i think \"maybe im banned? or someone hacked me? no problem ill just change my password and try to login with account name and new password in each reagion till i can find a match\" \r\n\r\nGo to my email and i see 2 emails saying that i purchased $200 worth of RP which clearly wasn't me because i didn't even have access to my account. Now what really annoys me is that this was through paypal which i don't use on video games \r\n\r\nanyway i put in support tickets for riot (which i guess is what im supposed to do?) and have paypal investigating the purchases.\r\n\r\nif anyone could be as kind to tell me if there is anything i missed or if they have had anything else happen to them like this and just wants to help another player out i'd greatly appreciate it.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-23T21:45:34.103+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We'd like to help you out with account recovery and reperations!
