It is great that we can change them during Champ Select and that we have 5 default pages (unchangeable that is), but it would be so much easier and convenient to have at least 10 that we have prepared specifically so we don&#039;t have to change 1 of our 2 pages entirely because a champ we want to play requires very specific runes that we want. Overall I think the new system is super rad and innovative, but that is the only complaint/suggestion to make it near perfect I have. {{item:2049}}","replies":[]}
