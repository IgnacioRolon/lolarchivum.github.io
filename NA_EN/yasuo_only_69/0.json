I know the issue seems to be fixed now, but there's no guarantee it won't happen again without some troubleshooting.  I recommend using the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to make sure that your connection can stay consistent.
