I know i shouldn't of done that and my punishment is deserved and i have learned from my wrongs but thats not the point. All i'm wondering is will i still receive the victorious skin of this season as im currently sat at  G5 and will i receive a gold boarder? I understand if i'm no longer allowed due to my ban just would like some clearing up to what i shall receive if anything. also just to add this was a one off where i didn't control myself as i had just reached honour lv7","replies":[{"poster":"Chermorg","date":"2017-09-18T20:02:09.044+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm sorry to say I can't bring good news, but you are most likely ineligible to receive any rewards for ranked gameplay this season.\n\nFrom [Riot Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/115011781068):\n\n> There are a few ways to miss out on this season’s rewards:\n> \n> - Players with bans or chat restrictions active when the season ends are ineligible for this year’s rewards.\n> - Players issued a ban of seven days or more from 22/08/2017 are ineligible for this year’s rewards.\n> - Players banned for boosting during the 2017 season remain ineligible for rewards.\n> - Players who experience fraud-related or erroneous bans will still be eligible.\n\nJust for clarification, I have edited the date in the quote to be in D/M/Y style (Day-month-year), everything else remains unchanged from the Support article.\n\nConsidering your ban was issued on 18/09/2017, and was 14 days long, you are ineligible for rewards for this season.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-18T21:41:16.348+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just to confirm, Chermorg hit the nail on the head with this one.","replies":[{"poster":"Gregne","date":"2017-09-18T22:02:28.007+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Broporo,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=zQLjEodA,comment-id=00000001,timestamp=2017-09-18T21:41:16.348+0000)\n>\n> Just to confirm, Chermorg hit the nail on the head with this one.\n\nokay thank you for replying to this thread means a lot and i have now learned that its unacceptable and consequences will be taken.

I was trying to help get trolls out of the game by asking (or telling) others to report the trolls.  \n\nYea I literally got my rewards for the entire year taken away for trying to help rito improve their game.  I talked to their support about it for about a year, and every time I proved I didn't deserve the loss of my rewards they'd delete everything said and start over. \n\n All my friends, family and I have not bought any rp since.  At this point it's cost them around $10k  Not a lot but when you consider it's because they would rather punish the ones trying to help their game its no wonder lol is considered the 4chan of online gaming (\"trolling on 4chan or LoL is like pissing in an ocean of piss.\")","replies":[]}]}
