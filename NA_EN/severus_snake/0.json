My friends are having the same issues. It kinda sucks being stuck with 10+ chests and 0 keys to open them.","replies":[{"poster":"Sardonic Sloth","date":"2017-10-07T21:42:59.868+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There IS a counter in your profile on how many chests you can still get and it maxes out at 4 and regenerates 1 per week, so you can get 4 chests and 4 keys per month if you manage to max everything out, so it evens out.","replies":[{"poster":"Severus Snake","date":"2017-10-08T09:18:59.357+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know there is chest counter but nothing about keys and how to keep an eye on them.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-07T16:55:23.874+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I took a look at your account, but wasn't able to find anything out of the ordinary here.  Honor capsules are random, so there could be a period where it just seems barren.  They also subtitle would would be a key fragment drop, so if you already reached your 12 per ~28 days then you won't be able to get more until your drop rate refreshes.  \n\nOur [Honor guide ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/115008474148)should have more info on that as well, though, I hope that helps clear things up!","replies":[{"poster":"Severus Snake","date":"2017-10-07T17:45:51.081+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And if there is a limit on key fragments are you planning to put some counter like there is one for chests?
