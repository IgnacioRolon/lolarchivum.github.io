Every time\"\r\n\"So I'm not enjoying the game. No one I'm playing with is enjoying the game... league has lost its magic for me\"\r\n\r\nThese are all things (outside of a bad ranked system) that the Boards have been asking for a while, but they're the reasons that Dunkey disliked the game.\r\n\r\nI really don't think people are ever going to stop hating and complaining about the game. Everyone wants the game to suit what they want, not what everyone else wants. Whenever people try to speak for others, it's often just a way to try and make their point seem more valid.\r\n\r\nPeople want the game to be tailored to them specifically. Riot tries to cater to everyone, but can't. Everyone hates and complains about the game because it isn't centered around them.\r\n\r\nYou play bruisers right now, you're going to hate this game state. You'd love it a lot more if it were 2 years ago.\r\nYou play supports right now, and you're going to be _much more_ happier than the supports in ye olde days.\r\n\r\nEven when the conditions are generally good for whatever class or set of champions people like, they still find reason to complain, because the game isn't fully molded to their ideal of what the game should be. \r\n\r\nVideogames encourage people to be selfish assholes looking to have fun, often without consideration for the randoms they get paired with. League and other multiplayer games always try to cater to everyone's complaints , and fail.\r\n\r\nEven if Riot does what the Boards are asking them to do, no matter how radical the change, you will still have a ton of complaints.\r\n\r\nBut you really shouldn't blame Riot or accuse them of being some malignant force trying to oust you and your champs. They're trying their best, and they can hear your complaints. They just can't satisfy everyone or change the game to be 100% based around you and your views.\r\n\r\nVideo is here, but I can't place it as a discussion link or have it be embedded due to temporary Board issues.\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjzgbZL12VI&amp;list=PLMBTl5yXyrGQTBDqpquLgLpgmuall8yUI","replies":[{"poster":"TehNACHO","date":"2018-01-11T07:13:41.218+0000","up_votes":28,"down_votes":8,"body":"Here are some of the facts on the matter.

To see how the game is going down and down but all they care is money. $sport.\n\nSadly that's what happens to every game that goes MLG or has a pro scene. It then becomes only about money. Sure making money is good, but when money gets involved in a big way, like e-sports/mlg. Then the quality of the game starts to go down after a point. It happened to Gears, WoW pvp, and Halo and its happening to LoL. This is why you don't try to make games into a sport, money/greed corrupts it, just like it does everything else. \n\nSo really us old guys have two choices, stop playing and let the game completely rot; because lets be honest here. LoL is 7 years old. Chances of it still being around in 5 years are minimal at best. What WoW did was very rare, its very, very, rare for a game to live as long as it did and has, mostly that is due to the massive amount of content that gets added with an expansion. But LoL doesn't have that. To be honest, you can only crap on you core loyal fan base so much before they leave and it doesn't matter how many new players you get. You can never replace your loyal fan base. A fact that companies seem to have forgotten. The other choice is to suffer through it and just go through the motions in a hallow way, not really caring or putting in effort. So its just a damned if you do and damned if you don't.","replies":[{"poster":"HalcyonDweller","date":"2018-01-11T19:47:45.949+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's certainly not only about money.
