He's a Darkin.  He's like Aatrox with a huge helmet and shoulder pads.  He's an ADC and he uses a demonic bow.  He has ties with Varus as he watched over him similarly to how Aatrox watched over Tryndamere.  Varus' bow actually belongs to Raa'tul.  One of his quotes is:  \"Vengeance is abandoned.  The bow is gone, made to new.  I am a weapon ignored by the ignorant.  War shall only thrive through us.\"\n\nAatrox and Raa'tul will get skins and both will be named \"Wargod\".\nAshe will have Victorious skin.\nRumble will have Championship skin.\n\nThe old Twisted Treeline will come back as a game mode in September.\n\nSomething is going on with Gangplank mid June.  Not sure if rework or what.","replies":[]}
