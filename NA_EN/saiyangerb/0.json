I sent a ticket but after that, nothing. No proof that it was sent in \"my activities\" or anything of the sort. How do I know that Riot will look into it? ive spent a great deal of money and time into this account and i really dont want to lose it in such a way. Any information that would appease my mind is greatly appreciated, thank you.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-31T17:24:05.689+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As long as you sent us a support email or filled out an [account recovery form](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=72416), we will receive your ticket and get back to you as soon as we can.

It would appear that my first two attempts at making a ticket just were never submitted somehow. I attempted it again this morning with the link you provided (which led to the page i previously used) and it worked and i now have a ticket 32381217, now ill patiently wait until it gets taken care off.
