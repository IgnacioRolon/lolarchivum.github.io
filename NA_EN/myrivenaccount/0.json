It's a pride thing. Riot has worked so hard to remove one champion carries like how Kat or mord use to be. So, when a team should lost but gets carried because of one person, well, it feels like you just got cheated. Simply put, if four out of five suck, then they shouldn't win because they get carried. But, on the other hand, if five out of five are competent enough to understand that said person is carrying, then they should work a quick strategy on how to deal,with them. \n\nUnless, it's someone like tryn. Then, it's just no fun for the opposing team. Going back and forth back and forth is highly annoying in itself. And, if a team who is working together, manages to win teamfights, gets objectives, loses to the enemy because of the work of tryn, a one man wrecking machine, then yah, it isn't fun or cool. This has happened to me and I find it toxic. Even more toxic because it is carried by one person.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2017-07-05T04:35:03.508+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's a pride thing.","replies":[{"poster":"MyRivenAccount","date":"2017-07-05T04:36:37.863+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=That Juicy Booty,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=akWJffEE,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-07-05T04:35:03.508+0000)\n>\n> It&#x27;s a pride thing.\n\na win is a win, doesn't matter, and 80% of this community has no reason to have pride about anything","replies":[]}]}]}
