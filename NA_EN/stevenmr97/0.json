I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s relevant to the banning of my account. What can i do to get back my account ?","replies":[{"poster":"nerak23","date":"2016-10-28T00:09:34.973+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> i didn't lock in this account for around 2 years and now it's banned\n\nI am going to guess what you mean is you haven't used this account for the 2 years ?  Yes ?  if I am mistaking what your saying disregard this post with my best wishes. \n\nSo, if it is that you haven't used the account it is my experience that you can get an account you haven't used in a long time back.  I've had the REAL pleasure of dealing with Riot who helped me get my unused account back... It was about a year that I had not used that one.   I sent a ticket and gave as much important information I could and asked to recover the account...\n\nGot it back, no hassle, very quick...I'd advice a ticket ASAP with as much info as you remember, My advice, take it or leave it is..\n\nSend a ticket, be polite, give information only you As the owner would know... Riot will assist with info if needed. Don't bump the ticket :)   It only puts it back to the end of the line I am told. ;)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Telephone Booth","date":"2016-10-27T23:48:03.720+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just wondering what locking your account is?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2016-10-27T13:52:50.089+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Create a support ticket here: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us","replies":[]},{"poster":"AeroWaffle","date":"2016-10-27T13:51:51.326+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Contact support.
