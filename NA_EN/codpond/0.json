I fell into the hype train this year, which is my own fault.  I mean all the Korean teams made it out of groups.  I just get left with this feeling of hopelessness.  Why should I even keep watching at this point?  Now remember I want to see NA win; I am from California, USA.  I respect the other teams.  I think the whole na vs. eu thing is dumb.  At this point we can all just sit back and say none of that matters. At its core the argument is not over who is better, it is over who is worse.  That is a terrible feeling, knowing no matter how good you are in your region, your just a speed bump to Korea? \r\n   I remember the casters saying how good TSM was at closing out games and how average game times were impressive out of that squad.  While closing out a game is an important attribute, I think it is a greater commentary on how na as a region falls short on playing a game out on the loosing side.  I never like to surrender, but I work full time, have a 2 year old daughter and a wife (they drain time too man...).  A loosing game can sometimes warrant a surrender if we are getting trashed.  Sounds legit, but I know I should keep playing it out to get better.  From my experience, when a few kills goes the other way people start pointing fingers and the salt factory opens for business.  It&#039;s ridiculous and it only gets worse each year.  I can not help but wonder if this is how competitive scrims happen.  I mean there will not be the salt, but do they play it out and fight it out with 100% or do they just surrender and get in as many scrims as possible?  I do not know.  \r\n   For 6 years I have watched and waited for NA to win.  The level of play was more even is this worlds than ever before, I know because I&#039;ve seen them all.  That is awesome, except the level of execution for all non-Korean teams is bewildering.  They throw out regions into chaos.  TSM did not look like TSM, CLG was outplayed as well as C9.  For me the raw talent of TSM is great, but the coordination and team play was abysmal.  I do not understand.  As for the hype, I felt like I was told there was a hot pool party with topless women.  However when I got there i find out its a 110 F day, there is a kitty pool in the corner and sun stroked grannies all around with EMTs putting leads on their exposed torso&#039;s.  Yea all the parts of the story are there, I was not lied to, but it is not at all what I had expected or was lead to believe.   Honestly I do not see NA having a better shot than this one for a while, or until the game looses popularity and good players up and leave.  I can tell you one thing, I will not be watching league anymore.  It is not because I think any region sucks or blah blah, I just know the outcome.  Korea is killing the scene because they are just that much better.  I feel embarrassed for my teams and I feel embarrassed for believing the hype.  I bet a lot of us feel that way too.  I feel riot should be worried because I brought like 20 people into this game and we are all disenchanted.  Hopefully for them we are just an isolated case.  \r\n\r\n6 years... and NA has not won worlds.  Feels bad.","replies":[{"poster":"Linna Excel","date":"2016-10-14T02:42:51.518+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a miami dolphins fan I can say this: get used to waiting.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Flaherty","date":"2016-10-14T03:20:00.240+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"At least we shove their shit in in real sports..","replies":[]},{"poster":"reaperteaser","date":"2016-10-14T04:15:22.341+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"the thing about korean being so good at league is that video games are part of their culture its almost expected from the youth there.

TSM and CLG had a good shot to get through group stage. They lost too many games in week 2 but overall, they still performed better than G2 and Splyce.\n\nYes, NA has been arrogant with the predictions of TSM, but so have I with G2. I really thought that G2 was the best team EU ever had when sven and mithy joined the team (my favourite players from Worlds 2015). But G2 failed hard. They had some great early-games but their baron attempts were generally awful.\n\nYou can't say that H2K > C9 if they beat ANX. ANX is most likely a much easier opponent than SSG. We'll have to wait and see for the quarter finals so see how H2K does against SSG. If they can win 1 game, then yes, they have surpassed C9, but we're not that far yet.\n\nSplyce, one of my favourite teams this year, indeed performed about as expected. No one expected them to win more than 1 game really. However, the fact that a team like Splyce made it to Worlds says a lot about the quality of EU this year. With the fall of Origen, there were really only 2 good teams in EU and then there were Splyce and UOL both being mediocre but they were the third best of our region.\n\nI may sound like I'm defending NA and against EU, but I'm a huge EU fan, I just think that this NA vs EU attitude has to stop and we need to support eachother and see the good in eachother, maybe even learn from eachother.

They were just straight out very bad, obviously better than G2, but they should take their fair share of blame\n\nTSM can claim some bad luck in draw, but in the end they choked out and lost the game that mattered vs their direct rivals , so I don't see how their performance can be seen as satisfying\n\nIf you got to rank the Western teams by performance, weighted through the draw luck and expectations it is going to be something like\n\nH2K >>>>>> >C9> TSM>Splyce >CLG >>>>>>>G2\n\nI don't honestly see how NA should be placed above EU IF H2k get to semi, given how they both have two underperforming team (and heck, Splyce went as good as expectations were, underperforming is not the correct term, more like they performed ok but were not up to par to their group), with both region advancing one team to KO stage and with EU placing a their team in top 5 of overall strength rankings if they get to semi (because they are surely better than C9, and would ahve directly beaten both EDG and ANX at that point)","replies":[{"poster":"Dr Poro","date":"2016-10-16T14:00:47.066+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"splyce did well because they were expected to do even worse\". Well, there is a reason why those expectations are low. Splyce was the lowest rated team other than the wild cards.\n\nCLG worse than Splyce? I'm pretty sure that in a matchup, CLG will easily beat splyce. G2 won vs Splyce, CLG won vs G2. It's not because G2 performed terribly that every victory against them means nothing.

Maybe they didn't prepare well enough against CLG and ANX, but I just want to emphasize that ANX didn't just get through with pure luck.

G2 played bad on their own terms, not because other teams played so well to force them to crash and burn, even ROX was shaky in group stage and they were actually fighting toe to toe with them till Smeb Kennen ult play, their bad play vs the teams in the group was their own inconsistency fault\n\nI'm pretty sure this Worlds Spyce has at least 50/50 chance or better with this Worlds CLG, and CLG underperformed a ton letting theirselves being beaten by a freaking wildcard team - and that is not disrepescting ANX, but major team regions can't afford to be eliminated vs wildcard in any circumstance, being eliminated means underperforming hard -in any circumstance becuase these teams have lesser infrastructure and come from a region with a smaller elite player pool -\n\nStop buying NA propaganda or mentality, CLG performance is abysmal having had them the easiest group of all in hindsight\n\n> What I&#x27;m saying is that EU isn&#x27;t &gt;&gt;&gt; NA yet, but I hope that H2K actually beats SSG and at that point, you can proudly say that we are &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; NA again this year.

If they lose vs ANX, of course it would mean NA would have performed better than EU, even though NA would still end up being beaten by wildcards and ended up 4th out of 6 so it would not have been a good performance in perspective\n\nSplyce was rated very low because people were overhyping other teams, but definitively they have not played so poor, so stop talking about crap like they were on level of an usual wildcard team. They didn't performe worse than many teams from major regions, with LMS being frankly bad and other Western teams being terrible, the 1-5 standing is misleading because it is the result of strong competition, not bad performances, while the 3-3 of CLG is the result of weak competition, not strong performance (and the same can be partially said for C9 record tbh, even though I still think they were the 2nd best Western team at this World cause at least they were mentally strong)","replies":[{"poster":"Dr Poro","date":"2016-10-17T21:10:49.741+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Now that H2K dominated ANX convincingly, I'm happy to say that H2K is by far the best performing team of the west seeing how much trouble CLG had against this team.
