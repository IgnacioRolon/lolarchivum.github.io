This went from cool/mildly creepy to terrifying. D: (sorry for a lack of a good picture of his hand but that's the best one I could find. XD)  Either way, I saw the splash and thought to myself, \"Wow that's kinda cool but Orianna's a bit creepy not really in a hugely bad fashi - wait that is a very ornately etched robot hand...\" Then when I realized that Blitzcrank doesn't have petite hands nor would Victor put time and effort into beautifully etching designs into his robotic appendages meant for mass murder, mayhem, and world domination/evolution...yeah. Way to make this suddenly terrifying because you have to wonder what the heck is he planning with that cake and who's going to get it. XD\n\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}}\n\nPS. Can we just get a Valentine Taric skin? (or any skin for that matter? ; u; Just wondering. &lt;3)","replies":[{"poster":"ClutchCrux","date":"2016-02-11T18:57:13.220+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Too bad its Orianna's hand if you look closely the heartseeker Orianna is a cake decoration.","replies":[{"poster":"Mira88","date":"2016-02-11T19:03:20.107+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"True enough, o.o I feel better now.

Also, the colors match Orianna, and not Jhin, who has a completely gold hand with no silver present. His joints are a blacker metal and the gold on his hand is more stylized than the one in this splash, so it's definitely not Jhin. \nOn another note, Taric is locked out of skins until his rework rolls out. Seeing as we won't be getting his outrageous fabulous sexiness prior to Valentine's, we can only hope he's out in time for summer for a Pool Party skin.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jack ยบ","date":"2016-02-11T19:05:10.002+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I hope for heartseeker/sweetheart taric... but make it hot.
