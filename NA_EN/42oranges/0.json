However, after I downloaded league again, I can not launch into the game. To be clear, I *can* log into the client, but if I go through champion select, it will throw me a \"Reconnect\" button and the game will not launch. Both league and my OS are updated to the latest version.\n\n[Image](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1OIPDinwUFzTWrueVpVfYRqd7pnPKmIpl)\n\nI have seen some others with this issue, but they were all windows users and their fixes were not applicable to me.\n\nThings I tried:\n\n**Press the Reconnect button**:\nNothing happened.\n\n**League's \"Full Repair\" tool**:\nClicked full repair, let the tool finish troubleshooting. However no issues were found, and the problem was not fixed.\n\n**Hextech Repair Tool**:\nDownloaded and launched this tool, but I can't see any of the words on the screen.\n[Image](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1YnxSEHHpdeWt9EvnX6lfeQJ4k_xPAY8b)\n\n**Apple's Disk Utility**:\nI ran first aid on my hard drive, found no issues, and the issue was not solved.\n\nIf someone could find a solution to this fix, it would be greatly appreciated. :)","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-23T01:25:45.306+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sometimes certain firewall settings will let you connect to the login servers and get into a game lobby, but the firewall then blocks you from connecting to the specific game server causing this to happen.
