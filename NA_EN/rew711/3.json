Why? Well, in early, you will have only around 50 damage. This will lead to 1.5 damage over the next 6 seconds (with 6 stacks). This can reach up to 9 damage points in total in early game and deals 72 damage if you have all 6 stats on the opponent. Late game, you can reach up to 300 to 350 AD and gain the passive ratio to 9 or 10.5 damage. It can 54 or 63 when put up to 6 stats and deals from 324 to 378 (or more) with this kind of AD over the next 6 seconds. This is way better than a flat 216 you get from the original.\r\n\r\nNow, that in itself is a big buff and if you want to see another idea I have in mind, please comment bellow.","replies":[{"poster":"Tsunday","date":"2015-01-05T17:53:41.194+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> but it also makes him weak in late game\n\nTwitch is a late game carry. If you build him/play him right he wrecks late game. If you think he's weak late game it's because you're not really getting to late game, you're ending games with a mid game build. He absolutely demolishes teams late game in teamfights.","replies":[{"poster":"IceKingChernobog","date":"2015-01-05T19:02:16.961+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"His late game is pathetic now, compared to carries such as trist, jinx, and graves who can just rip anyone open with shiv, at least 2 dragon buffs and 3 aa's","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"astralwit","date":"2015-03-25T06:09:27.015+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There have been a lot of LCS, LCK etc. games and Twitch is almost never picked.

Yes Twitch has a weak laning phase.  This matters a lot more in solo queue where lane swaps almost never happen as opposed to competitive play where Twitch can be lane swapped away from a bad lane matchup or at least be given more jungle support than usual.  Picking someone off tends to be more rewarding in competitive play as the communication is there to take objectives after the pick is made.  Twitch having stealth makes him very good at creating picks on unsuspecting targets.  Finally, while relying on a team to be able to peel for an ADC with no reliable escapes in solo queue is foolish, it is possible to rely on peeling and strong positioning to stay alive in competitive play.\n\nThe biggest thing that I worry about in this case would be a buff to Twitch to make him more solo queue viable turning him into a pick or ban ADC competitively translating into him getting nerfed some point afterwards.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2015-01-06T03:33:23.078+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Draven is seeing alot of play as well.

Corki gains a lot of power from his passive. Just dealing that \"true damage\" is amazing. He can also gain small bonuses from AP for his Q, E, and R which all help in the long run. Corki also is a fun champion to mess with, and has a easier time as a ADC actually able to accumulate bonuses from getting a lot of AD.\n\nADC's in general should be able to get a lot of AD and make use of it. But, Twitch cannot do this. His passive doesn't even give the usefulness it should being it can be easily countered with heals, potions, and does nothing to Tank supports who guard the opposing ADC such as Braum or Taric. Now, in making it based of AD, it is also able to be blocked by armor which does give some reason to be cautious but that can be avoided with armor penetration.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"5G8Nri0B54","date":"2015-01-06T02:17:08.411+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I will agree with the Passive change, as in it's current state, natural health regeneration is enough to overshadow it. Meaning it's 100% pointless outside of making his E stronger.\n\n\nHowever I will disagree with the assertion that he is weak late game because of his R.\n\n\nI will however, say that he is a bit too reliant on his R for power. I don't like champions that are completely reliant on something with such a high cooldown for their power. Like how MF solely exists for her R late game.\n\n\nIf you look at what's hot atm, you'll notice all current ADC's have one thing in common, their main power is often ready and available because they aren't tied to something that is only available once in a while. Tristana's range and Q are constantly in her disposal. Lucian's insane mobility and burst. etc.\n----------------------------\nAll in all. I disagree that he is weak late game. I agree with your idea for his Passive though as I want it to be more than just an E-enabler. And I add that he could be made a little less reliant on his R late game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Raise Dongrs","date":"2015-01-05T17:46:33.034+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean as long as your Support doesn't have downs, farming is easy and your slow combo with rushed BoRK and W allows you to cake on the stacks for some early kills.
