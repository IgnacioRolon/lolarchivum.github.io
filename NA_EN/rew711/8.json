Also Fizz is now losing a lot of damage if he misses his E or just uses it for mobility, since his Q is nerfed pretty substantially, sort of how, in some ways, LeBlanc loses a good chunk of her damage for using her W for mobility (she still has a ton of burst even without it though).\n\n>Designed to annoy you but also provide a satisfying feeling when you catch that bastard and wring his neck.\n\nPart of the reason I ban Fizz, besides when he's powerful he's pretty obnoxious to play against, is that because of his E and general frustration from playing vs him, I might commit too much to killing Fizz, which is pretty bad.

He get's an improved version of flash every 8 seconds at max rank without cooldown. He can reposition, dodge skillshots, and interrupt targeted abilities chief among them: Syndra's, Vi's, Caitlyn's, Zed's Ult.

I cover the actual damage of the DoT with an example and detailed explanation. The DoT does not play any valuable role short of they would have otherwise lived with 5 hp and the DoT finished them situations where that overwhelmingly small damage would have contributed something. The damage from the E is what would be wrecking an enemy. Heck, W is the last ranked skill by almost any Fizz player, and for good reason, so it sits there doing 10 dmg a second for 3 seconds almost the entire game (a bit more with some AP but largely invisible). It is the active that was worth anything on his W and now it is even stronger. It was a buff.\n\nWith 0.7 attack speed you can get usually at least 2 autos in and then follow up with Q or E depending on how you chose to engage. You can get more autos in with your ult stuck to them as well. Usually you can expect 3-5 autos depending on if they flash or not and how quickly they get to tower safety. Even 2 autos makes it vastly superior to the DoT portion and much better then the old active. Anything beyond 2 autos is even further bonus. A single auto with the active on new Fizz would already completely out performs his entire W from current Fizz.\n\nIt is easy to dodge but it is also fairly easy to land in most cases. As a Fizz main I use it half and half because it can be useful for mind game engages but sometimes you want that CC post engage to guarantee they don't escape or that it will not miss. Even then you can use Q to engage then apply Chum amp which lasts 6 seconds giving you enough time to make use of it if you delay the use of the ult.\n\nLevels 1-5 didn't really get impacted as the AP ratio on Q doesn't matter when you have no AP and the dmg drop is the same until you start ranking Q which comes after E and the difference is extremely minor until mid game where it is still pretty minor and more then made up for by the amp at that point. The W got buffed if you get even 1 auto off with the active, period.\n\nIt was a buff. You may have climbed to Plat 3 with him but you are not showing a clear understanding of Fizz's kit beyond mechanical use of it. Again, look at the post I referenced and you will see just how wrong you are on top of this explanation.","replies":[{"poster":"Cindikle","date":"2015-01-22T21:44:59.355+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Assuming 3 autos with W up. \nOld Fizz:\n1231.75 Base damage + 430% AP scaling.\nNew Fizz:\n1254 Base damage + 406% AP scaling. \n\nThis is a full burst, including ult, and 3 autos.

With the amp buff his scaling would actually be a bit higher including Lich, but only very very barely. This isn't factoring in base values though. His total burst would be a bit higher so if it is on a target not hit by Chum it would lose out slightly to old Fizz (excluding the impact of the % base value which could have a hefty boost to his total dmg).\n\nHere, his ult is still just added bonus as the core of his damage remains almost entirely intact. Fizz can still do what you point out and more.\n\nHis dmg didn't take a significant hit without the ult as the core of his damage is still Lich + E which were untouched and the total scaling + base values are roughly in line with old ones except he now does more dmg per auto attack later in the match.\n\nAs a whole he was definitely buffed against tankier targets and remains almost identical against anything else.","replies":[{"poster":"Cindikle","date":"2015-01-23T00:32:01.381+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I will go though it again a little better.

Not sure what you mean by he will have to make up for it when he's at 400+ AP. Early game the old active will scale a bit better but the new one should win around mid and definitely late game, excluding the amp. Of course, prior to the % damage new Fizz was already winning based on the numbers you provided, which I duplicated with the variables you provided. The lack of grevious wounds could be regarded as a significant loss in some people's opinion, but I don't really think it was a big deal since Riot pretty much killed serious sustain/healing quite some time ago and the duration of 3 seconds (could be extended by reapplication, but a drawn out fight is Fizz's weakness) isn't exactly a real counter to passive sustain (including lifesteal on minions) and champions who benefit heavily from lifesteal will usually pop instantly from Fizz, anyways. The biggest concern is the combo of Heal burst + LS with BT on some rather fed carries that you might have otherwise killed if they had been healed for less but often ignite gets carried by Fizz, anyways. I suppose it could be a definite loss to non-AP Fizz but I don't really run that so I can't provide an adequate comment on that.","replies":[{"poster":"Cindikle","date":"2015-01-23T02:13:18.515+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"His base damages are higher.

The CD on Q is hard to pass up but even just putting 2 levels into it makes it more flexible with some CD reduction possibly coming in a bit earlier or simply deal with the longer CD in exchange for more dmg. For now I think I would take the reduced CD, but that will be something I give more consideration to later if the change comes through because the increased damage might be worth it. I know non-AP Fizz builds will be looking forward to this.\n\nA flat CD cost on E, and hopefully mana if that happens, would definitely be worth consideration to make Fizz manageable if the changes become an issue. This is especially so due to the issue of mana regen where every AP basically suffers from mana issues in S5, even running chalice/Athene's + another mana item while Fizz is used to it and never really got mana regen items anyways.","replies":[{"poster":"Cindikle","date":"2015-01-23T03:28:36.086+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Another thing to factor in is that if his active W is going to play a bigger roll, forcing him to auto more than just from the Q hit, Nasher's may become stronger than Lichbane on him. \n\nThe AP and base damage will be lower.

It does give CD which Fizz likes and could make the W route easier giving him some CD for Q/E. It also gives ASPD to help his W even more and still applies the Nashor on hit as well. It gives reasonable AP too. Would it make Lich + Nashor be a viable alternative as well? I doubt it but might be worth considering (though you would certainly have to fit a big AP item before finishing both, probably just getting sheen at some point and heavily delaying Lich finish until 4th/5th item).\n\nI don't play him much recently because I like to play different champs every game (bar I will play Yi/Fizz/Malphite/Leona more then anything if I am to repeat pick). The few times I have played him recently I didn't see any mana changes at all, it felt just like normal since I don't get mana regen items on him even though I laned against Zed (both times I believe, once earlier today). It is definitely worth knowing how to deal with a champ then complaining about one. My one issue with Fizz is how hard Hexdrinker/Maw counter him which is particularly useful on Zed on top of his ability to avoid with clones/ult.\n\nNow I have tested Chalice, Athenes, Morellocon and a combo of the two as well as even flat mana regen/lv yellow + blues and still see issues with champions like Lux, Syndra (oh god...), and some others.

I cover the actual damage of the DoT with an example and detailed explanation. The DoT does not play any valuable role short of they would have otherwise lived with 5 hp and the DoT finished them situations where that overwhelmingly small damage would have contributed something. The damage from the E is what would be wrecking an enemy. Heck, W is the last ranked skill by almost any Fizz player, and for good reason, so it sits there doing 10 dmg a second for 3 seconds almost the entire game (a bit more with some AP but largely invisible). It is the active that was worth anything on his W and now it is even stronger. It was a buff.\n> \n> With 0.7 attack speed you can get usually at least 2 autos in and then follow up with Q or E depending on how you chose to engage. You can get more autos in with your ult stuck to them as well. Usually you can expect 3-5 autos depending on if they flash or not and how quickly they get to tower safety. Even 2 autos makes it vastly superior to the DoT portion and much better then the old active. Anything beyond 2 autos is even further bonus. A single auto with the active on new Fizz would already completely out performs his entire W from current Fizz.\n> \n> It is easy to dodge but it is also fairly easy to land in most cases. As a Fizz main I use it half and half because it can be useful for mind game engages but sometimes you want that CC post engage to guarantee they don't escape or that it will not miss. Even then you can use Q to engage then apply Chum amp which lasts 6 seconds giving you enough time to make use of it if you delay the use of the ult.\n> \n> Levels 1-5 didn't really get impacted as the AP ratio on Q doesn't matter when you have no AP and the dmg drop is the same until you start ranking Q which comes after E and the difference is extremely minor until mid game where it is still pretty minor and more then made up for by the amp at that point. The W got buffed if you get even 1 auto off with the active, period.\n> \n> It was a buff. You may have climbed to Plat 3 with him but you are not showing a clear understanding of Fizz's kit beyond mechanical use of it.

Grievous wounds is the only real nerf to it but I would argue its value was pretty low mid-late game when he could burst you hard enough that it often didn't matter and most mid laners don't carry heal so early game it is often non-issue. Fizz commonly carries ignite, too. The grevious wounds only lasted for 3 seconds out of 15 so it really didn't mean much against anything except Soraka and Heal summoner. Q applies the W so that doesn't really matter though considering he has a double gap closer he can always get an extra auto off so this makes it even more effective, roughly twice so. Note that your ignite + E are doing the majority of the damage to that 250 HP target and Q + W are dealing ~78 damage after Mres at level 3. The new Q + W will do ~58.8 (both cases assuming 40 AP and no autos with 600 max hp target). This puts old W slightly ahead, very very slightly until you start ranking up W. The difference is small enough to completely ignore it early-mid game and late-mid and late game it is a huge advantage in favor of new Fizz. Against targets that stack HP early it is also a much larger advantage, particularly if they decide to rank W before Q which may now become a thing. W is also much better for non-AP builds.\n\nYou have to be at risk to go in and place that extremely weak DoT that is often much weaker even at rank 5 then almost any lv 1 ability in the game. The trade off is not worth it in that sense. The DoT does not add any value here. The DoT's only real value is finishing targets that would have survived with say... 5-15 hp or to slightly negate a potion for 3 seconds during a fight where, again, they would have survived with extraordinarily low health values.\n\nThe ranged champions will be the same as before, a rough early game in most cases unless you can get an early blue buff due to the mana cost on E. The on-hit is the core follow up Fizz has for trading with a ranged champ, not the DoT. The Ult is fairly accurate at about 50% of its max range which isn't hard to close and early game can reliably be done with Q to guarantee a hit and followed by E thus possibly evading some reaction damage and dealing an amp'd hit. With a double dash if you can't reach the ranged champion it is safe to say you are OOM or afk. If you are missing Fizz ult 80% of the time at semi-max/max range then this is an error on your end. It is far more troublesome to land Anivia's Q and a few other skill shots then Fizz ult and even those are pretty easy. You can abuse terrain to force it to hit except when they have a strong blink or flash. Using flash to evade a Fizz ult is the same as claiming it makes the skill impossible to hit for any other important skill shot in the game. It isn't a viable excuse and you can always hold  Chum until they burn their flash if need be. I have covered why it can be applied at close range and still be effective for the amp purposes. It is especially easy to hit if you are at ~50% Chum's max range or less.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Meep Man","date":"2015-01-22T19:20:30.267+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Xengre,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=dMeGWddA,comment-id=00010001,timestamp=2015-01-22T05:07:23.741+0000)\n>\n> Alright, so to those who aren't actually aware this is a buff.\n> \n> Q/W got nerfed but were already, effectively, the weakest dmg abilities in the entire game and it does not impact Lich which is the main strength of Q.

Now that the active was swapped to a % per hit this means that in 3 seconds, for instance, he can deal up to 4-5x as much % dmg as the old one could in a single application. The DoT portion was truly worthless on Fizz, particularly since DoT is meaningless on a burst character.

Also with 500 AP, that adds an extra 150 or so damage to the DoT on every basic attack. The DoT was extremely good. DoT on a burst also allows a burst champion to deal their burst and get away and then get the kill without having to stay around and seal the deal. They also removed the AP Ratio on his active, a big thing.\nThe Q damage nerf was also very big.
