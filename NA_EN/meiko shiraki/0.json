Any other skin I play on is fine but elementalist always makes me reconnect to get this error out. Even when I reconnect there will still be minor issues like disappearing minion health bars. I would appreciate some feedback on this issue because I love playing with this skin.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2018-03-19T23:12:30.245+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey peachlipgloss, \n\nWould you happen to know if you have 2 or less gigs of RAM/what OS are you running on? We're aware of this particular issue, but are still tracking down leads. Any info you can provide would be wicked helpful.

It's really annoying and it throws me out of the game and gives me bugsplat .
