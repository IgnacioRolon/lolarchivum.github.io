You did good to run through the connection guide, though it's a bummer it hasn't helped.  I recommend double checking any blocks from firewall or antivirus settings, but you can also grab the logs from the HRT and attach them to a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).  Our tech team can check this out with you individually and find some more options.","replies":[]}]}
