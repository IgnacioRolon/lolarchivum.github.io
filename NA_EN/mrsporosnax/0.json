This audio glitch happens _every single time_ I use CTRL 1 on Forecast Janna. This started happening when the new Taric rework was released to everyone.\r\n\r\nIs this happening to anyone else?","replies":[{"poster":"GaleWinUnleashed","date":"2016-05-02T20:55:21.427+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Known bug, we've had a Red respond to this one once or twice recently.
