Since almost exclusively mid laners take Cleanse, and with characters like Malzahar, Warwick, and Skarner being around, it forces a mid laner to build QSS, which is just a waste of an item since it only builds into an AD item. Cleanse already has a decent cooldown, so it seems unfair that mid laners have to build QSS instead of just taking Cleanse to balance things out. It won't prevent CC chains and there will still be a window of opportunity once it's down.","replies":[]}]}
