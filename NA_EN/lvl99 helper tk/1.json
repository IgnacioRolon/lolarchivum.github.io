A lvl 6 mid will show up when both are 4/5. A lvl 6 top/jg will show up when bot is still 5. A lvl 6 syndra showing up bot will flat out murder a lvl 4/5 ADC.\n\nThere is usually a lot of extra CC thanks to Support kits. Easier ganks. ADCs are incredibly squishy early, and not threatening at all. Meaning, easy kills. I mean seriously if you are thirsty do you not go to where the water is? Or do you complain that the water is bot when you want it top? Botlane is the watering hole for gold in this game. Its the easiest to successfully gank, and their is dragon, and a paper turret down there, which is much easier to push down with a seiging  champ(ADC) and an extra person(Sup). At least 3-4 people pushing down a turret designed to  be pushed down early because of Lane Swaps. Which then leads into early dragons.\n\nTop lane is much harder to gank. I know people fall for a 3:30 minute gank every single solo Q game, but that doesnt change the fact the champs up there are more resilient, higher level, and harder to take down. There is also less CC, and less damage up there, since there is less people. Its much harder for a tank/bruiser and a jungler to take down a top laner. Hell, if the top laner is ahead and is Riven/Renekton/Darius/Whatever, he can possibly 1v2 kill both of them. This doesnt happen botlane. One hook on the ADC botlane during a gank and hes probably dead. They are not tanky. \n\nThe reason people gank bot is because its the easiest to do. It has the highest success rate. It leads to the easiest objectives. You cannot get a turret that easily by ganking top, even if you get a kill. They generally have TP, the turrets are tankier, and Top laners just seige worse. You kill the top laner he just TPs back in 15-20 seconds, to an armored up turret. You can easily get a bot lane turret if you just pressure the enemy bot lane out of lane. You dont even have to kill them. If you chunk them both, you can force htem out of lane and easily 3 man the turret.\n\nMaybe the real issue is how easy the botlane turrets are to knock down, but this is a direct result because of Lane Swaps.","replies":[]},{"poster":"FurriesAreHot","date":"2018-04-20T20:24:24.701+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"If you think an ADC, or even a bot lane, can snowball as hard as people claim without constant jungle and mid support, that's just ignorant.","replies":[{"poster":"TempName54846","date":"2018-04-20T20:32:40.744+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"if other roles mattered as much all roles wouldn't be \"supporting\" bot lane but rather other way around.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Verl0h","date":"2018-04-20T03:20:17.824+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":47,"body":"A fed ADC should naturally be able to carry the game as long as the team around him/her plays around that advantage, hence the name \"Attack-Damage-Carry.\"","replies":[{"poster":"SwiftKitten88","date":"2018-04-20T03:28:58.326+0000","up_votes":25,"down_votes":4,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Verl0h,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Ie1oLpKB,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-04-20T03:20:17.824+0000)\n>\n> A fed ADC should naturally be able to carry the game as long as the team around him/her plays around that advantage, hence the name &quot;All-Damage-Carry.&quot;\n\n.... first off.. its \"attack damage carry\"\n\nand no..

Now he's just a walking Q bot with an incredible size to scare people, while being a gigantic target for ADCs to right-click and kill in 3 seconds because of Giant Slayer items and BotRK (and fucking Jhin's rageblade build and his AA nuke) that double-dips on HP shredding making HP itself completely obsolete in the eyes of ADCs.\n\nAnd with the last list, the problem is that some of them are not doing well on their own in the game, so even if they're a reliable stun-bot for ADCs it still doesn't mean much when they're underperforming everything else (Ivern was nerfed into oblivion because of stupid buffs Riot did on their own and then overnerfed him, Annie's kit is severely outdated and is basically nothing outside of Tibber-stun, and Riot attempted to \"fix\" Malz resulted in making him **THE** R-bot and the rest of his kit has to suffer a plague because of this terrible decision). Morgana and Zac are nice, but only Zac has full agency here because Morgana has to rely on either existing snowballs or misplays of the opponent to get her things in; and even when Zac has full agency on what to do with ADC, if his bot feeds then it's still all over anyway (and this applies to every single pick you've listed, given the game is so centered around ADCs, if your team's ADCs are not fed and lags behind the enemy ADC for any reason then there is a very good chance that the game is automatically doomed no matter what).
