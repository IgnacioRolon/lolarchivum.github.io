It's quite frustrating because all I can do is press power button and force the computer to shut down and restart it and this has led to several afk/leave games for the past days. \r\n\r\nI'm sure that my graphic card driver (Nvidia 920) is up to date.\r\n\r\nShould I post log file here?\r\n\r\nPlease help! \r\nSorry for my terrible English and thank you very much!\r\n{{item:3070}} \r\n{{item:3070}} \r\n{{item:3070}} \r\n{{item:3070}} \r\n{{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-14T02:17:14.868+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you're running Windows 10, it's possible this is caused by the Windows Game Bar, which has a feature called *Game DVR* that has caused freezing and low FPS in the past.
