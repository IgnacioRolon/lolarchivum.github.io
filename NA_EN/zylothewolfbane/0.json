Anymore Lux&#039;s can just throw their E at you, and IMMEDIATELY detonate it on top of you, doing instant damage. I read this change on the patch notes, and wasn&#039;t sure how much of an impact it would have.\r\n\r\nI now know what impact it has. Lux is now EXTREMELY oppressive in lane, able to get near-guaranteed damage on you consistently, everytime the spell is off cooldown. The spell does decent damage, especially when maxing it, and unless you have a dash, or the enemy targets it poorly, it is practically impossible to avoid. Add to the fact it still slows you, allowing her to set up for a root, followed by an ult, the fact the skill isn&#039;t blocked by minions, travels very fast, and has a very forgiving AoE radius means that it&#039;s essentially free harass. Why is there any reason NOT to use it everytime on cooldown unless you&#039;re running low on mana?\r\n\r\nI&#039;m not sure if anyone else has noticed this, or maybe I&#039;m just shit at the game, it&#039;s entirely possible. So if you have advice on how to avoid it? Great, if not? Then that&#039;s a problem.","replies":[{"poster":"Reikken","date":"2015-07-02T10:52:51.500+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"She was always able to do this.\nIf you ever played against someone with like 10 ping, this is how it worked.","replies":[]},{"poster":"360D3GR3SS","date":"2015-07-02T07:58:41.790+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"No. This changes was not only warranted but so miniscule that the very few circumstances it affects seldom end up in a kill or some kind of advantage.

Honestly I think I'd rather them keep it and do it for all mages (and some others) like that instead of changing Lux's back. It's either that or ya know, make it so people on the east coast actually have decent ping, and we all know that's not going to happen. \n\nA few champions that need it as bad as Lux: \nZyra with her W combo with E or Q. I see a lot of people that can cast W and E/Q at basically the same time. Whenever I try to do this the W doesn't get cast. Unless I'm missing something, it's a ping issue. \n\nXerath with his ult. Everyone else seems to be able to rapid fire off three at once, I cannot. \n\nAhri and her ult. Same as Xerath. \n\nFiora and her double Q's coming out faster than I can hope to attempt. \n\nOrianna and her W. \n\nDiana Q combo with ult. A lot of people can use and refresh the ult at the exact moment the Q hits, no one I know with east coast ping can do it. \n\nI'm not sure if all of these are ping related, but I'd bet that those six are.","replies":[]},{"poster":"aaronautumn","date":"2015-07-02T07:24:56.423+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"During lane phase, do you move around when last hitting minions, or do you stay in the same spot? The best thing you can do is move around between last hits, moving forward or at an angle usually helps. Early on, if you stay next to your caster minions while she's spamming her e, she'll push the lane closer to you leaving her more open to ganks. In the event of a gank, don't stay clustered together, if you're next to your jungler then she can q you both and run away (or burst both of you depending on how much damage she has at that point). If she's spamming e before level 6, she only has one other damage ability available, giving you a brief window to get your own poke in until it comes back off of cooldown.","replies":[]},{"poster":"YumaS2Astral","date":"2015-07-02T07:08:10.520+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, there are still ways for you to mitigate this spell's impact. For example: If you are using an AD champion, rushing {{item:3155}} mitigates Lux' damage and make all-ining her easier.\n\nIf you are using a long range AP champion, rush a {{item:3028}}. An error that many people make is to think that Morellonomicon is just an outright better item than Athene's when Athene's magic resistance actually helps early game against those oppresive AP spells, and has a lot more reliable mana regeneration, so you can compete with Lux' mana regeneration much easier.\n\nIf you are using a short ranged OR manaless AP champion, you may want to rush a {{item:1057}}. Most of those short ranged AP champions do not have problems with mana, so they can just rush a Negatron Cloak, which is way better at reducing Lux' damage. You can then upgrade this to an Abyssal Scepter.","replies":[{"poster":"ZylotheWolfbane","date":"2015-07-02T07:13:26.732+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Even rushing MR isn't that useful. The problem is less about the amount of damage she's doing, and more just that she can almost ALWAYS LAND IT. Sure you can mitigate the damage you take, but you will still be taking a significant amount of it, if only because if you are in range, she WILL hit you. This is especially troublesome when playing against a Mid lane Lux, for two reasons.\n\nFirst, is that most mid-laners have very little sustain, so any harass that you can't avoid, or trade back will add up quickly. Second is that since Lux is mid lane, she can farm up quite well, and start getting pretty big ticket AP items, which makes the practically free damage she gets, start racking up REALLY hard. My last match I was playing Viegar, and I can't exactly stack MR and go full tank, and even if I did, I doubt it would help much, because she can just harass so easily until I AM low enough to burst.\n\nSo while building MR is a good idea, it's also a broad, blanket idea for almost ALL AP mid laners, and does not actually address the primary issue here, which is how easily Lux can get this damage out, and how oppressive that becomes.","replies":[{"poster":"Matezoide","date":"2015-07-02T07:19:56.403+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"B-B-B-BUT LUX IS WEAK AND UNVIABLE E COSTS SO MUCH MANA AND SHE CAN NEEDS LIKE 2 ITEMS TO 100-0 SQUISHIES FROM OFF-SCREEN OMG RITO PLZ","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Ixoziel","date":"2015-07-02T07:26:56.538+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"God forbid she has a way to deal guaranteed damage to you.
