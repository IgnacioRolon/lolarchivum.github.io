All of this has happened within the past 3 weeks. Can someone kindly explain what on Earth's going on?\n> \n> Between my ban and now, I have significantly improved my behavior. Note that even before my ban, by \"toxicity\" wasn't exactly atrocious. I'd like Lyte or another Rioter to kindly look over my chatlogs and review whether the chat restriction and ranked restriction are justified. The amount of punishment for the time frame plus the given evidence is completely unbalanced. Between my ban and now, I have hardly even been toxic. Please reconsider these punishments.\n\nI got this in response: \n> Greetings player,\n> \n> Here are some chat logs from those games played that were negative.

When there is nothing good to say, don't say anything at all. If you do not show any tendency toward improving your behavior, you may see harsher punishments.\n> \n> Legendary \n> Player Behavior &amp; Game Support \n> Jarvan IV Jungle \n> \"For the King!\"\n\nto which I replied...\n\n> Uh dude that entire time I was with my friends on Skype. Where do you see the toxicity? I wasn't toxic at all. I was calling myself bad the entire game, saying I'd go 4/20 (I was 3/1 and said I needed 1 more kill and 19 more deaths at 9 minutes, look at stats if you don't believe me). Nothing was meant to harm other players. Even when I say \"m/c\" I'm referring to what I'm saying. I didn't use sarcasm with intent to hurt anybody; when I told amumu to stop doing his job, it was because he literally was building armor and because of it I had to go Last Whisper, while I would've preferred to go PD or IE.\n> \n> Btw \"Dino\" (not sure which player he was in this game, and I forget his in game name) is my friend in real life and he knows I was joking/trolling with him. His feelings weren't even hurt. Oh, and I even told everybody at post-game screen (especially Nasus and Zyra) that I was joking. They were even laughing about it and I'm pretty sure they gave me honors if I remember correctly.\n> \n> And bro what's up with ANOTHER 2 week ban? Don't tell me this is the only chatlog you have, because this is just lame. I don't see myself insulting ANYBODY in the entire game (except MAYBE mother-c*cker, although I wasn't really calling anyone that, I was just being sarcastic when I was asked what M/C means). I mean I was convinced you guys had some sort of epic compilation of my toxic chatlogs, but this isn't even toxic dude. I'm not lying when I say I was joking. You can even ask the player Dino (I think his name is Black Cleavage) in game. There was not a single insult I meant that I said; quite frankly I don't even see anything outside of joking and having a good time with my friends.\n\nBasically I'm posting this because I'm tired of waiting 10 days for a response. I'd honestly prefer to have a 5-minute 1 on 1 (no, not like that...) with a Rioter from Tribunal but I can't seem to add any Riot employee as a friend. Btw, one last parting thought, because I KNOW everybody is going to say \"lul you were toxic in the first line noob\": first of all, when I said \"mother-c#cker\" it was meant as a joke. Quite frankly it doesn't even make sense. Second of all, out of context it certainly sounds insulting. But I said m/c, after which Zyra typed \"m/c ?\" (asking for the definition) to which I replied \"mother-c#cker\" *jokingly*. Anyway I told everyone I was joking as I already said above. Can't believe I got punished so severely for something so minor.","replies":[]}
