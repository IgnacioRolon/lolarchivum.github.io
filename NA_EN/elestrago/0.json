I played the next game and all of the sudden, everything is messed up.  My right click button is ping instead of instant buy at the shop, im playing in windowed mode, and everything is on smart cast but isnt quite smart cast.  I hit an ability and the little cursor changes and it takes like 1.5 seconds to actually \"smart\" cast the ability.  What the heck.  Out of nowhere ALL of my keybinds seem messed up.  if they \"work\" they don't work as intended.  What is going on?  How do I fix it?  I have tried running the repair tool, tried reinstalling, tried deleting the config.ini, tried deleting the RADS folder, nothing has worked.  How can I truly restore all keybinds to default?  Thank you.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-14T18:09:18.346+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's a really strange issue, and it's like your keyboard found a mind of it's own.  It sounds like your smartcast was enabled to have indicators, but I can't really explain all the other outcomes.  Your configuration folder may have become corrupt somehow, so I suggest resetting it.  Keep in mind that doing this will require you to rebind your keys:\n\n **Log into the game** then hop into **a custom game**. *Alt+Tab* out of the match, then navigate to your League installation folder, which should be in C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\n\nDelete the folder named **Config**\n\nOnce you've deleted the folder, leave the custom match. You'll then want to hop into another custom match to confirm the changes were saved.\n\nHope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
