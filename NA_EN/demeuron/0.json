The ping was ~200 and it wasn't too bad but few weeks ago my ping suddenly increased from ~200 to constant 240-250 making it unplayable..

Ping issues can be due to network issues like a weak connection or packet loss.  In this case, you have the physical distance of reaching to our servers, which will definitely cause some ping discrepancies.  Meaning, no matter how much we improve your connection it can't exceed the expectation of that distance.  With that in mind, I suggest using our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to help improve your network as much as possible.
