The only similarities between the two games were both had Miss Fortune and Vi.\r\n\r\nMy ranked promos had Pool Party MF whereas this most recent Naut game of mine had an Arcade MF.\r\nI'm of the opinion Warring Kingdoms Vi might have an issue that causes FPS to slowly deteriorate, but I'm entirely sure.","replies":[{"poster":"Fyrewolf","date":"2017-01-21T11:18:24.834+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yes, other people are having the issue. I am having the issue and If you ask your teammates and opponents they will also be having the issue. Unfortunately, Rito is just going to point you towards their FPS Issues guide. I have tried most of the guide, except contacting support, turning off all non-windows services and disabling all sound. However, my FPS was fine the 1000's of games before this patch and nothing has changed on my end, so I just don't see what that will do for me. Of course, i'm going to try it, because I want to play the game and in its currents state it's not enjoyable. I understand that Support has to give answers like we are the lowest common denominator (Have you tried rebooting), but what's maddening is the gross dismissal that the problem could be on their end. \nGood Luck.","replies":[{"poster":"Mavel","date":"2017-01-21T16:26:13.418+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same. Did everything in the FPS guide, contacted support and did all that jazz. Still happens. This has never happened before, i have a 1070 so i'm pretty sure it's not my system if it happens to everyone in the game also. Until Riot realizes the issue is from their side since the lunar festival update, we're screwed. I can't play like that till they fix it.","replies":[{"poster":"Rabblerouser","date":"2017-01-29T18:59:58.808+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Next time it happens, kill the new client's processes and see if that fixes your FPS.\n\nThe beta client will restart automatically and you'll see the FPS drops return.
