It sounds like your client is not properly communicating with the PVP.net service, which is what pushes and pulls play status to everyone else on League. The [troubleshooting connections guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) should address the most common solutions for this.

It's NOT a Showstopper bug.

Do you happen to be using the Alpha Client when this happens? Also, did you give those steps in the connection guide a shot to ensure your connection to the PvP.net service is stable?","replies":[]}]}]}]}
