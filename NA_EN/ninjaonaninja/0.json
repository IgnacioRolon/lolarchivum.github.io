I restarted the game and didn't really think anything of the crash. After a few games, I remembered about the keys and came back to open a box and my keys were gone!\n\nThe crash happened after I played a game and went straight into the crafting inventory then clicked to combine the keys. That was all that happened pretty much.\n\nCan I get my keys back? I want that fat booty!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-15T21:54:19.226+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Looking into this, I was able to see that you turned 3 fragments into a key.  You then used the key to open a mastery chest which gave you a Divine Soraka shard.  Even though you crashed during animation, the information is still sent to us so no worries!  If you keep crashing, disable any 3rd party programs like play.tv as they've been known to do that.  Hopefully, that clears things up!","replies":[{"poster":"NinjaOnANinja","date":"2016-09-16T01:01:47.050+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh yeah, there was a missing box. I guess I missed that detail. \n\nDarn! A puzzle I coulda solved! xD\n\nThanks for the quick response! <3","replies":[]}]}]}
