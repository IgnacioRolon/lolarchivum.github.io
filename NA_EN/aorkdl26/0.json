I do not buy enough wards, especially in jungle, mainly cause you fall behind no matter what in jungle most the time even if you get fed, so buying wards just slips my mind while I try to keep up in items/levels, but even in those games where I do ward a ton and in good places, idiot teams who never listen will always be idiot teams who never listen.\n\nThere's like a reverse psychology aspect to games atm ya know, like I can win early-mid game for my team if they don't hardcore feed like that match I mentioned and actually quite a few more, but if I do so they are almost GUARANTEED to get arrogant and stop listening to my pings and directions and start goofing around and chasing kills, only getting themselves killed while I try to push down lanes and force objectives we can either get for free or win a fight for.  You need your team to be behind while you stay relevant or even fed so they see you as their only hope and listen to you.  Like seriously the only games I've managed to force my teams to finish out are ones like that, where say I get hella fed in top lane and start pressuring mid with my advantage to keep us even, but my bot lane and jungle feed horrendously putting us on the back heel, yet my team sees my kda and realizes \"this guy who is still positive about winning is doing very well, maybe we should listen to him!\"\n\nBut getting that happy medium is ridiculously hard on purpose, and it really only applies to the way the ranks are right now, with so many bronze baddies too far up in rank due to the awful placement system.  Eventually they'll all derank anyway and those of us who got bumped down will once again just carry ourselves back out, the never ending climb I usually give up on once I hit gold again and just focus on ranked team play cause it's more fun and always will be....","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"CheckMyDoubles","date":"2015-01-30T02:53:05.474+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"This has been posted before but it's a good reminder.\n\nELO Hell does not exist, it's just an excuse for bad players to continue to make the same mistakes and blame their teams and match-ups.\n\nSome people make the best of each situation and learn from it, others just blame everyone else for their failures.","replies":[{"poster":"Chromatic Eagle","date":"2015-01-30T03:44:38.224+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I make several mistakes that costs me the game.

The truth is that in League, to climb up the odds are stacked against you. In order to get promoted one needs to be better than the average player in his/her tier. However, that also means that one will be matched with worst players on his/her team or against better players on the enemy team because of his/her MMR. Eventually, it becomes even more and more difficult to win.
