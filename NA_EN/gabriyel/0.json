This account is for me to try new champs and learn them so I&#039;m not always great.. \r\n\r\nFIrst one started out with us winning hard (ezreal adc) But our rengar jungler was noticably doing.. nothing.. eventually at 20 minutes he outright quit.. Then my support (pyke support who does nothing but ult lol) also quit. GG inted by quitters.\r\n\r\n\r\nSecond game, my support literally flash suicides into enemy team. Then she runs it down through their turret.. Then our top laner dies once and comes bot refusing to leave. So after we lose two turrets top and every1 ignores it I go top, focused by top lane, roaming mid lane, and jungler cc locking me.\r\nTeam rfuses to ff, my support repeatedly going afk for short bursts of 1 to 3 minutes.  game goes 40 mins before we ff.. Team was toxic as fuck to me in chat for going from 2-1 to effectively 3v1ing a lane they exposed, and I ended 2/14 while the viktor who ignored his enemy Laner never coming back ended 9/9\r\n\r\nAfking support actively refused to help me in a fight (I asked her to laneswap to top with me and that I can&#039;t overcome CC without a support and her react was &quot;OH SO ITS MY FAULT? HAH U DIED 3V1 WAS THAT MY FAULT HAHAHHAA)  our top laner continued to int suicide.. Jungler was toxic in chat..\r\n\r\nIs this what I should expect all preseason?
