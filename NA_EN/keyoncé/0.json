No slightly less increased movespeed, increased damaged, etc? I just feel like Tahm would be a great opportunity to incorporate some type of interaction with the river if one doesn&#039;t already exist.","replies":[{"poster":"ABlueQuaker","date":"2015-06-25T07:35:54.647+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That interaction would have to be purely cosmetic or otherwise it would be utterly useless on every other map and would be incredibly situational on SR.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Darkmind1212","date":"2015-06-25T07:27:55.868+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The world is his river.

I was hoping that when he went in the river his model would change to him being submerged in the river which would allow his abilities to do some neat stuff. For example, his Devour ability (W) would allow him to lunge forward to eat people in the river. It'd still be a point and click ability but just with more range and look more menacing.
