I feel like i'm one of the very few who just accept that the game is what it is honestly. All the toxicity, balancing, and ect, I have just came to accept that its just part of the game that I gotta deal with and if I dont like it, I always have the option to quit. Call me weird, but I still find league very fun and exciting to play, and I'm not trolling, I legit mean that (just look at my lvl if you dont believe me lol). Is there anyone else here who actually does not mind the bullshit and just looks past it and takes it for what it is?","replies":[{"poster":"Shieda Kayn","date":"2019-08-02T13:00:24.062+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":0,"body":"People complain because they care.

You know how people talk about their grades slipping because of that new thing they found that they love? This was that. I was sleeping in class in high school because I was staying up all night to play League with friends who had just gotten into it like me.\n\nI would rage, and I would laugh, and I would complain, and I would praise. I was passionate about the game. I was in love with it.\n\nBut like most things, time dulled my love for it. Compounded by many changes to the game that felt really bad, I fell out of love with it hard. Keep in mind that I still hardcore smashed League of Legends like fucking liquor for 5 years before I finally started to slow down. And even when I slowed down, I was still playing at least a few hours each day. But then my friends started to stop playing entirely. Each time a friend would stop, the game became that much more lackluster for me. \n\nIt took me 6 years of League to realize that League was never the treasure. It was (and I'm saying this 100% not ironically) the friends I made along the way, and the memories we created.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GilxeN","date":"2019-08-02T08:24:40.595+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's clearly not the same game I used to play 3-4 years ago.\n\nModern champs are utterly overpowered and given with such lame kits.\n\nReworks are nightmarish to balance except few.
