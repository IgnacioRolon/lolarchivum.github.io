I said this because I spectated a game they lost and I know they weren&#039;t communicating. They very rarely pinged, or typed to their teammates during the match, unless it was to blame them for bad decisions (spectated on Twitch so I know this.) I was told I was wrong in no uncertain terms and effectively told &quot;map awareness is the only thing that matters, and the baddies on your team who don&#039;t have it are why you lose.&quot; I was flat out told &quot;voice comms don&#039;t help you win.&quot;\r\n\r\nI could not disagree with that more.\r\n\r\nThe players that told me this were silver and have played for several years. I don&#039;t play ranked, and have played for several years. So they feel I can&#039;t possibly be right about anything because I don&#039;t outrank them. In my opinion, they&#039;re not bad players mechanically, but I simply can&#039;t believe anyone could ever be a truly good player when they don&#039;t believe communication is a factor that matters. \r\n\r\nKeep in mind,  They literally told me &quot;my teammates should&#039;ve known what to do and when to do it, and they didn&#039;t and that&#039;s why we lost.&quot; To which I replied, &quot;well you could have communicated better.&quot;\r\n\r\nHere&#039;s the thing too, they were a 4 man premade, and one of these two players who argued with me is very toxic. Extremely toxic, and flamed the solo queue guy in their team, the one guy they couldn&#039;t have possibly been communicating with in voice. The loss is the fault of the only guy you couldn&#039;t have possibly been communicating with? Or is that just a really convenient excuse for your toxicity because you know better than to blame your friends? Blame the guy you don&#039;t know for not reading your mind. Did you lose because he didn&#039;t &quot;have map awareness&quot; or did you lose because you refused to communicate with him? You know, like maybe an alert ping to help him have map awareness? I suggested the latter and was told I didn&#039;t know what I was talking about cause I&#039;m an unskilled player who isn&#039;t ranked, and &quot;communication isn&#039;t necessary past a certain point&quot; Which I guess is Silver V.\r\n\r\nAnd I&#039;ve said this so many times to so many people, I can&#039;t count it anymore. This refusal to communicate is such a **huge** problem in League of Legends. \r\n\r\nThe guy who basically taught me this game so many years ago is platinum, and he&#039;s EXACTLY like this. I find it patently ridiculous, that this guy, who&#039;s Plat 2, will join a normal with what at the time is a brand new player. and then GO OFF on the other people on the team for not doing the right thing. Having this unvoiced expectation that the other 4 people will do exactly what you want is insane, and it&#039;s _**YOUR OWN FAULT**_ for not using the tools built into a **_TEAM GAME_** to communicate.\r\n\r\nThis selfish &quot;only I can carry and my teammates aren&#039;t doing what they should be doing so we&#039;re going to lose&quot; mentality has no place in a team game. \r\n\r\nYes, you can carry, you can also help your teammates help you carry. Communicating makes it easier for all of you, having unspoken expectations is an unnecessary obstacle that **YOU** put there. Putting obstacles in the path of your team is not how you win, and that&#039;s a fact. Expecting your teammates to &quot;be good&quot; is a loser&#039;s mindset. Helping them to be good, is a winner&#039;s mindset.\r\n\r\nI&#039;ve played this game for several years and this is the trend I&#039;ve noticed about toxic players. All of them are selfish, all of them hate losing, and none of them have ever deserved a loss in their life, every loss they&#039;ve ever had was someone else&#039;s fault.\r\n\r\nThey think they&#039;re the best player on the team and they **_FLAT OUT EXPECT_** everyone on the team to read their mind without any communication whatsoever. If their teammates aren&#039;t psychic, and don&#039;t do exactly what the toxic players wants by reading their mind, they&#039;re the baddie and the reason for a loss.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m a support main and I do understand about having synergy with your teammates and reacting to what they do. If my ADC does something stupid, I have to react in time to save him, if I make a play and stun someone, my ADC has to react to me, otherwise I&#039;m just wasting mana/cooldowns/windows of opportunity. &quot;Reading the game&quot; is a necessary skill, and a skill you learn over time, but it&#039;s one that&#039;s made so much easier with communication. I can ping and let them know who I&#039;m focusing. I can type a brief message: &quot;focusing Ashe.&quot; And, in the case where you&#039;re a 4 man premade who have access to voice comms, they&#039;re the fastest, most effective way to do this, and it doesn&#039;t even require using your fingers which takes precious milliseconds off of your mechanical abilities. Ironic that so many people won&#039;t stop to type to help their teammates win, but they&#039;ll spend minutes typing at them for doing the &quot;wrong thing.&quot;\r\n\r\nTL;DR, if you want to win, there&#039;s no excuse for not communicating with your team. Period. Simply expecting your teammates to &quot;be good&quot; and &quot;know how to react to me&quot; is selfish and stupid. It&#039;s asking to lose, and then **_blaming_** the other players for the loss when _**you**_ didn&#039;t take the effort to communicate with them? Maybe you&#039;re the bad player.\r\n\r\nSo who&#039;s right? \r\nThis unranked player who &quot;doesn&#039;t know anything about League of Legends?&quot;\r\nOr these toxic Silver Gods of the game who expect everyone to literally read their minds, and feel justified in blaming them for not doing it?","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-09-05T20:48:18.774+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"Incidentally, in this messed up season 6, most silver players are worse than unranked ones.\n\nCommunication is critically important, probably the single most important thing to a team.

If you at least say \"amumu, go in\" and he responds \"stfu\", then fine, I can understand not wanting to say something after, but if you never convey your desire, then it's your fault they aren't doing what you want.","replies":[{"poster":"Champion Skin","date":"2016-09-06T16:06:22.067+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Grevious wounds was changed back to reduce all healing (which obviously include Soraka heal and ult)\n{{item:3165}} is a great item (just with it's stats alone) though the Grevious Wounds is a bit unreliable as you need to drop the enemy so low before it triggers\n{{item:3123}} is amazing triggering on all physical damage and it only costs 800 gold and it gives AD worth 525 gold meaning you only pay around 275 gold for the grevious wounds passive (I had a Caitlyn rush it against me when I played Soraka... it was so annoying and painful..

Or are you talking about typing out what you're going to do? From skimming over the wall of text I'd have to say yall are both a little right and a little wrong. Alot of the difference I saw climbing was with peoples ability to make plays cohesively, and they would get better at their pings, letting people know of SS timers and such, but there is kind of an expectation that an obvious play will be recognized and followed up on that u wouldnt have time to communicate. Like a counter gank or a dive, your teammate should be able to tell what you're going to do based on your movements. But in a lower elo I would probably just not worry about that kind of stuff as much and focus more on solo plays unless a teammate proved themselves reliable enough to play around.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Soggy Doggy","date":"2017-07-05T03:00:41.306+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Doesnt matter if the team just tell you to eat a dick and mutes you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shifune","date":"2016-09-06T13:58:33.792+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've had a few ranked games where literally no one on my team said a word all game.

People come home decide \"I need to unwind, so I'll play some league\" and then just have a nice quiet game where they don't have to do any extra thinking, they can just use a  champ they're comfortable with, their teammates can do the same and just coast to victory, without any extra stress or effort. \n\nSure, this can and does happen, but it's rare and not the norm. You said yourself, \"a few ranked games.\" The expectation is very rarely the reality. If what you want to do is just play League to relax, maybe you don't want to do all the \"extra\" work that communication requires, and that's fine, unless you get pissed when you lose because of it. If losing is going to be not relaxing, or not worth it, and you didn't communicate with your team, but instead placed unvoiced expectations on them that they obviously didn't fulfill, you're the reason for your own bad experience, because the expectation (that your teammates were just going to \"be good\" and \"do the right thing\") was too high, and not the reality.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Athenes Lulu","date":"2016-09-06T17:41:14.469+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I hope that guy is only joking around, though you are giving us the impression that he's legitimately serious.\n\nIs that your typical \"boosted animal\" in its natural habitat?
