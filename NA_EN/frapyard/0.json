My internet connection works perfectly fine otherwise but when i'm in the Client every 30-60 seconds theres the message \"Trying to reconnect\" popping up and im getting back to home screen.

Doesn't work. I've seen that this is a common problem for some time now and you are always posting your connection guide.
