However, I really don't like it. I tried disabling it in options, I set it to 'classic', but it still plays the special event music. I tried changing it so that it was the special event music and then changing it back in a different game to try to see if that would refresh it, but it still didn't work. Please, I just want regular summoner's rift music.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-03T00:12:13.657+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had to reach out to a few people to see if there's even a way built into the client to revert the updated music for Worlds. I'll do my best to reach out to the devs to see if this could be put together easily enough, but you should also go ahead and post this over in Client Discussion to get this conversation a little more attention as well.","replies":[{"poster":"KAAAAAAAYN DO","date":"2017-10-05T13:02:36.214+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd like to follow this also, really don't like the music and every previous soundtrack/map changes have had a disable map accents/themes like for the winter map and arcade.
