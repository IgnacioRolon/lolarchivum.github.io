Please help I never realized how much I used this hotkey.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-15T16:36:10.367+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just tested it and was able to use /All chat through the normal enter key as well as the numpad.  I'm not sure what might be causing this for you, but instinctively it does sound like your config files are acting wonky and not interacting with the server.  This could cause your bindings to not work properly on live or PBE clients since it's saved server side.  As a first step, I recommend resetting your config files to be sure:\n\n **Log into the game** then hop into **a custom game**. *Alt+Tab* out of the match, then navigate to your League installation folder, which should be in C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\n\nDelete the folder named **Config**\n\nOnce you've deleted the folder, leave the custom match. You'll then want to hop into another custom match to confirm the changes were saved.\n\nLet me know if that works out for you!","replies":[{"poster":"TNG Im On Drugs","date":"2016-09-15T21:05:21.561+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, I just tried this, still no luck thanks for the recommendation though.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-15T21:17:45.143+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the update!
