A slightly favorable exchange rate and small cash gift would cheaply encourage everyone to come when scheduled and bring all their money, too.  Fines and jail time for stragglers would handle the rest.\n\nMeanwhile, they can order all banks in the defeated region to surrender their previous currency for Noxian coins, removing huge amounts from circulation.  These two large exchanges would happen under the shadow of two looming requirements.  First, all shops would be required to accept Noxian currency and all taxes would be paid in same.  Next, the old currency would simply be banned.\n\nOver two weeks, any settlement of any size could be converted to the new currency with almost no effort.","replies":[{"poster":"Lordk0z","date":"2018-08-27T07:20:07.262+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Like I said, this requires effectively minting out enough new coins to replace all the old ones, and then being stuck with now-worthless coin that you then have to melt down to have it be of use.

In other words, it&#x27;s expensive, inefficient, and has no real benefit outside of crushing conformity.\n\nNoxian coins are no doubt cheap and easy to make, considering the expansion of the empire.  They’re probably just small zinc disks.  Melting the coin would take a day or two of a couple blacksmiths’ furnaces, earning a tidy profit for the empire, since coins of precious metals can be smelted into bars sold to the highest bidder.\n\nThe exchange rate need only be a $20 gift and 1% extra on the exchange.  Someone who has even $1,000 in cash would walk out with $30.  A million dollars would handle over 300,000 people like that.  When talking about governmental scales of cash, that’s cheap, and smelting the coins would easily pay for it.  The banks would not get a favorable rate—just a swap.\n\nCrushing defeated civilizations into the dirt to squeeze out their blood, sweat, and tears as fuel for a relentless war machine sounds just like what Noxus is all about.  The strong don’t just defeat the weak, but then take their strength to add to their own.  Changing the currency just makes that easier.\n\n> Which is both ideologically opposed to the Noxian ideal of free struggle, where the strongest, the most fit, triumph, as well added cost for a conquering army.\n\nDemacia is not the only nation whose ideals are often used as an excuse.  The Noxian ideal of ‘strength’ is just an excuse for everyone to take whatever they can—power, wealth, prestige—however they can from whomever cannot stop them.  The Noxian reality is a single master ruling a world of slaves.\n\n> Your average peasant doesn&#x27;t pay taxes in coin, but rather in whatever he produced.

Read up on modern lore man, Swain overthrew the Emperor and put three people in charge as a ruling council with Darius and Definitely Not Leblanc.\n\nIt’s not genetically, pointlessly evil.  It’s using the people it conquers as cogs in a war machine to conquer more people to use as cogs and so on.  Here’s what I imagine.\n\n1) Raid.  Everything of value not used for commerce is plundered by the troops as booty for having stormed the city.\n\n2) Enslave.  The children are taken away to Noxus, where they will be raised as fanatics to do the empire’s most dangerous work.  The women are handed out as war brides for the garrison troops.  The men are conscripted into the army as cannon fodder, slaughtered, or immediately pressed into work alongside the women.\n\n3) Exploit.  The city is made into a fortress factory, producing supplies, weapons, troops,  food, precious metals, and raw materials for the empire.  All vestiges of the old culture and language are destroyed, including temples and schools.  Subjects live chained at the feet and sleep chained at the wrists, in warehouses.\n\n4) Terrorize.  Any dissent is met with torture into confession at show trial, followed by implications of others, who are likewise treated.  All dissenters are executed.  Random subjects are arrested or simply disappeared just to keep the rest guessing.\n\n5) Indoctinate.  Propaganda everywhere.  Required recitations at breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  Lack of enthusiasm is dissent and to be reported by co-workers or family members.  Children are taken from their parents at birth, but breeding is mandatory to grow more bodies for the empire.\n\nThey crucial thing here is taking the children from the parents at birth.  It achieves keeps the culture and language from being passed to the next generation while letting the empire completely indoctrinate them.\n\nMeanwhile, once Singed fades from the public eye, Swain will release new gas bombs that can kill an entire army from miles away and use them non-stop.  The bombs will then be used to exterminate any city that does not immediately surrender.  Spies will be sent to sneak concentrated poison into the water supply of enemy nations.\n\nCome to think of it, Swain is ruthless enough to mass flying units and gas-bomb every Ionian and Demacian city, river, and major farm around the clock.  Even if the people living there survive his bombardment, the countryside won’t.  They’ll all starve to death sooner or later.\n\nWhat is holding him back from just going complete monster and taking over Runeterra inside the decade?\n\n> And according to your decrees, you&#x27;re still going to have to send forces out to collect and swap all those coins anyway, even if they&#x27;re not being traded, which is wasting more of your forces time.\n\nIt’s a couple of weeks early in the conquest.

The ‘strong’ rise and are ‘accepted’ there because they use whatever means necessary to destroy the ‘weak’ in an endless, ruthless power struggle.  If you don’t ‘accept’ them, then they’ll destroy you, too.\n\nWant a promotion in Noxus?  Murder your boss and hire thugs to kidnap his boss’ family.  Like your neighbor’s jewelry?

Better have had the money to bribe them before and pay them after.\n\nThe world-building is just to explain what the Noxians tell themselves so they can sleep at night.

Every time I ask about something foundational to the world, you say, “Oh, yeah, we’ve been working on that”.  I hope more of this stuff could come to light one day.\n\nAs for your edit... well... It’s funny you should mention that.  *hikes up suspenders and pushes up glasses* \n\n“Taliyah had almost forgotten how much she’d missed the furnace heat of Shurima – the sweat and crush of hundreds of people pushing, cursing, **haggling and speaking with such passion and speed that outsiders often thought they were fighting**.” (Bloodline, Paragraph 1, emphasis mine)\n\nOur little sparrow might just have loved the “sheer bustle and energy of her homeland,”   finding haggling to be a casually harsh confrontation that upsets the weaker party upset and denies them a fair deal, but that does not sound like her.  First, were children really  going hungry because of their parents’ desperation for deals, Taliyah would not accept haggling’s contribution to the city’s atmosphere as an excuse for so much suffering.  \n\nSecond, if I remember your comments about her from an earlier discussion correctly, then she learned Noxian from her father during negotiations for the sale tribal goods.  Her father no doubt taught her not to accept first offers and, if necessary, haggle.  Indeed, just like real-world shoppers like the feeling of getting a good deal from paying 99 cents rather than a dollar even though they know they’re almost the same, it might be Shuriman business-as-usual to offer high opening prices, inviting customers to demand lower ones, that they might feel like they got a good deal.\n\nThird, the second line of Stoneweaver states that Taliyah was raised to be “a true daughter of the desert”.  While that line refers to seeing beauty in the bare stone, that clause is broad enough to suggest a wholehearted embrace of Shuriman culture, from the goat’s milk to the woven cloth to the ancient cities to, yes, getting a good deal on a kebab at the market.  If haggling is wrong, then Taliyah might not want to be _right_.\n\nWhich brings me to my last point.\n\n{{champion:163}} “I saw your kids bringing  vegetables through the back of the tent as I walked by—they barely fit through the door!”","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2018-06-07T15:00:35.008+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Bioluminescence,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=jdmtxE6M,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2018-06-07T01:15:35.856+0000)**Piltover/Zaun**: Gold hexes, silver gears, and bronze washers.\n\n...those poor, poor artificers and store owners.\n\n**Heimerdinger:** Yes hello.

The accents might give you trouble, and the video quality is terrible, but it's charming old-school funny.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUNVFrRy-cE","replies":[{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2018-06-07T15:19:52.599+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Bioluminescence,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=jdmtxE6M,comment-id=000100020000,timestamp=2018-06-07T15:15:48.572+0000)\n>\n> May I introduce you to the (now very old) comedy sketch from The Two Ronnies that feels very appropriate for this.

So thanks very much for this. Old British comedy is a favorite of mine. :)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"patmax17","date":"2018-06-07T07:44:08.683+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Bio!\n\nCan I ask you something I've been wondering for a while now?

So I asked a bunch of other knowledgeable Rioters and they pointed out the loading screen tip.  The loading tips are a bit of a blindspot for me - I read them, but have trouble remembering that that's the source of a factoid.)","replies":[{"poster":"patmax17","date":"2018-06-07T15:12:13.991+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hahah, I know the feel of being the one that knows about something xD\n(and I also know the feeling of needing to look up if I said something wrong :P)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Spideraxe","date":"2018-06-07T02:28:42.725+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Would Zaun/Piltover ever get to the point of being able to use cryptocurrency since they are so advanced {{sticker:vlad-salute}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tesla Effect","date":"2018-08-27T12:11:09.926+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Bioluminescence,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=jdmtxE6M,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2018-06-07T01:15:35.856+0000)\n>\n> So far, player facing, I think we&#x27;ve established:\n> \n> **Piltover/Zaun**: Gold hexes, silver gears, and bronze washers.\n> **Bilgewater**: Golden krakens and silver serpents.\n> \n> There was also a coin mentioned in the Rek&#x27;Sai teaser diary from Noxus, but I think we might see about tweaking the name of that a little bit.\n> \n> There are other types of currencies, but those are the ones that I know of being player facing so far.
