The narrative team has obviously put tons of effort into fleshing out all of these places, cultures, and characters, and it shows. But it&#039;s beginning to get frustrating how little of this information is player-facing, and how buried away a lot of it is.\n\nWhen Pyke came to the PBE, there were a ton of interesting things I heard in his VO. What is this swimming city? What is the power or being that brought him back to (un)life? His bio and short story proceeded to not answer either of these questions. Is the swimming city some kind of literal place under the sea? A term akin to Davy Jones' Locker?  And this new powerful entity we haven&#039;t known about until now? We don&#039;t get to hear about any of it! But the writers have shown in the past that even when they don&#039;t tell us these things, they do absolutely plan it all out. We just aren&#039;t allowed to know for reasons beyond me.\n\nWe only have a vague idea of why Jhin started going around killing people because of a Q&amp;A! We know it has something to do with his father&#039;s martial arts studio going out of business, and the only time it&#039;s mentioned is during a Q&amp;A session shortly after his release! I don&#039;t think that&#039;s the kind of place players should need to search to learn more about the characters they love.\n\nBut the most frustrating of late for me has been Swain. His Bio does mention him usurping the throne of Noxus, taking part in the failed invasion of Ionia (losing an arm in the process) and somehow tricking a demon of secrets, but they are glossed over in a sentence or two each. Should events so incredibly important to Swain as a character AND one of the most prominent nations in the lore really be treated with the same importance as describing Swain brushing his teeth in the morning? Any of these could have made great candidates for his short story or the longer form story introduced alongside Swain. We may get more info about the overthrowing of Noxus trickled to us at a later date but I seriously doubt we&#039;ll ever get more information about the demon he made a deal with and tricked through unspecified means. In fact, did you know there&#039;s concept art of the demon itself? It&#039;s hiding on his Champion Insights page, which brings me back to the last problem.\n\nThe reason this is so upsetting for me is that I love a lot of the work the narrative team put in. Of all the short stories, not-so-short stories, little champion stories, etc, I could count on one hand the ones I genuinely didn&#039;t enjoy. Whenever we do get a bit of information about one of Runeterra&#039;s cultures or what-have-you, it always feels interesting and fleshed out, but for each thing we&#039;re told it feels like there&#039;s dozens more that just aren&#039;t. And often times that feels bad. And the promise of &quot;We&#039;ll talk about it and let you in on the secret one day&quot; doesn&#039;t really help.","replies":[{"poster":"Nylisa","date":"2018-06-01T09:10:36.077+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes. with each update we learn new names, new places and phrases that we know nothing about. there are still things we barely know anything about from 2010 and we propably wont in years. their significense is lost when you have no idea what they are suppose to represent, or if it hold any significent meaning at all. at somepoint it feels like an attempt to make the story more in depth. like the guy at a gathering who make references to stuff no-one knows what they are, just to make himself more interesting, but it just comes off as confusing.\n\ni understand there is a certain art in implanting certain details in story that reader might discover if they are paying attention, but in an enviroment like this, it will probably fail to hold my attention, because i don't want to wait until 2023 for a new champion in bilgewater, so i learn something about pyke and think \"ah so this is what it was\" \n\nThis is exactly the reason, the death of Yasuo's elder meant nothing to me when i finally learned about it. it was like i didnt even care anymore after **years** of waiting. and i'm starting to feel the same way about so many things in league that are left untouched for many years.\n\ni hope @Scathlocke sees this cause this is a very important feedback for me.","replies":[]},{"poster":"IcyPepper","date":"2018-05-31T16:53:17.849+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">But the most frustrating of late for me has been Swain.

Another thing about Swain that I think would be really important to expand upon sooner or later is a bit more detail on this vague future threat he wants to prevent is. I think a big part of humanizing why he's so not very nice is that \"the ends justify the means\" mentality where he's actually trying to save humanity from something or other, but we don't yet have even scraps of information with which to guess about it. He just comes across as a nasty ruler who you have to swear fealty to (along with Darius and another unknown that might get expanded upon in 2020) or die with some vague notion that he's doing this for some kind of reason.","replies":[{"poster":"midnight oil24","date":"2018-06-04T22:41:16.107+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm guessing it's either the Darkin or the Void. The Void might be slightly more likely, as they seem like the biggest imminent threat to Runeterra (I'd say maybe the shadow isles is more certain, but they seem to stick mostly to Bilgewater), and the Darkin seem pretty low on numbers. Not that they're not powerful, but against the runeterran natives of the league roster they probably wouldn't stand a chance without really bulking up their numbers. It could also be Mordekaiser, though, as swain makes references to Mordekaiser beginning his march.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Ifneth","date":"2018-06-01T02:30:12.434+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, I’m really surprised that they don’t do more lore stuff.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Vlada Cut","date":"2018-05-31T17:26:03.906+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Speaking of his VO.

There is no shared blood between Pyke and Illaoi. Pyke does not worship her god. However, Pyke is half Buhru islander and immigrant (probably from Freljord). His mother was a local, his father moved to the Bilge. \n\nThey are \"aware\" of each other for some obscure reasons... Illaoi sees Pyke as serving a much larger eddy and therefore is in motion. \n\nAlso, there are several hints in Pyke's bio, color text, and his VO, that instead of me telling you what's what, I hoped players would connect some dots and have fun exploring/theorycrafting. Understandable if that's not everyone's pint of rum.","replies":[{"poster":"Oleandervine","date":"2018-06-01T16:39:30.816+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's theorycrafting, and then there's vacancies in the knowledge we have. Nautilus is a case of fun theorycrafting because of his Lovecraftian themes, and Lovecraft deliberately left the unknown so we can form our own nightmares. Pyke on the other hand, needs a bit less gaps in his origin story, because simply blaming everything weird on unknown things in the sea muddies the waters. It would have helped if we got a clearer understanding on what happened to Pyke, instead of he was swallowed by a fish, Pinnochio style, and then saw the blue magic sacs in it's mouth glow and suddenly he's back to Bilgewater murdering his way across town. Like did he die? Did a leviathan god intervene? Was he consumed by a magic fish? Did he kill his way out of the fish to get back to land? These are things we should know, as they help us  to get a better grasp on his story and his character. But just \"he's in the fish, underwater - and suddenly murdering in Bilgewater\" is jarring.\nPyke was implied to be dead. I think. Parts of his kit imply that. We don't really know for certain though, because a lot of hit kit also implies he's got sea god connections like Illaoi. So what and who he is is blurred by this lack of information.\nAnd we know Illaoi detests the dead, as they go against the motions that her religions teach - so why would she be ok with him, if he's dead? So here's the thing - his state of being is like Schrodinger's Cat, and it's a bit frustrating to have to read and understand. We can't really extrapolate or theorycraft about him and how he operates and relates to the world if we don't even understand his life state.\n\nIf he's dead, that means he's a cool sea zombie, though it doesn't translate effectively from his visuals and VO. If he's not dead, then he's just another version of Nautilus, turned into something more-than-human by unknown sea magic.","replies":[]},{"poster":"edoxbox1","date":"2018-06-01T16:39:05.397+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=FauxSchizzle,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=9qBvv0r2,comment-id=000200000000,timestamp=2018-06-01T16:23:13.511+0000)\n>\n> (probably from Freljord)\n\nOH.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"calibergunsaint","date":"2018-05-31T20:56:39.016+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The line is \"Your sermons damned me Illaoi\", as you can see from the voice interactions video.\nI actually asked in this board if they are related somehow, cause of the line and the similiar weapon design and theme, Riot FauxSchizzle actually responded and said that they are aware of each other in some way.

You can summrize Pykes lore in one line- \" was a butcher, became a sailor, got betrayed and eaten by a giant fish, got revived and now kills people-fin\".\nNo talking about who or what revived him? why did it revive him? Why is it telling him to kill people who aren't even connected to his revenge?\nHell, we aren't even sure that the ship he was on even existed, or if he actually killed his crewmates that saw him drown, or just a bunch of people in the wrong place, at the wrong time.\nHis voice lines? Yeah, good luck finding any clues from that. The only intresting one is with Illaoi, and even when I asked this board if they think they are connected,  Riot FauxSchizzle actually answered me with, and I quote: \"I wouldn't say that they are related. But they are aware of each other's existence.\" Yeah, super clear answer.\nAnd it's not like they didn't hide clues in places, a recent dicovery I found was that Udyr might be connected to the Blood Moon event (the actual holiday, not the skins). His bio states that every generation, a child is born under a blood-red moon, and that child will go on to grow into a part of the legecy of the Spirit Walkers, the bridge between man and spirit (The last airbender style, only with animal spirits).\nSo- spiritual mention? check. Theme of birth and rebirth? check. A moon so red it seems like blood? check.\nFrom this we can speculate that Udyr and the Ionian Blood Moon are connected in some way, like in Dark Souls when they drop little hints all around.\nHell, the entire lore of Jhin actually gives us context of why Zed began to hate his master so much.\nBut currently? It seems that they are just really lazy and everytime they want to release a remake/ new champ, they go at half force, start building up a story, stop, release the champ then begin working again on the actual plot twist of the plot they were making.\nAm I really supposed to think that Swain just found the demon crow just out of nowhere in the battlefield, then found it in the Immortal Bastion and just... took over its power right on time on his tight schdule of taking over Noxus?

I think even the Journal of Justice was so much better in telling stories about champions.  Now I feel like they are not consistent and never old champ bios or where they left off.  This honestly contributes to not caring about the bios/short stories anymore because you just know they will just change it once a new narrative team comes along.  So basically if I read a new narrative I don't even take it seriously. \n\nThe narrative team probably has a lot of turnover which contributes to this prevailing problem.  When I first started this game, the first I wanted to learn was their backstory and why they were important and special (I absolutely loved that whole J4 and LB -but guess what? they never expanded on that or revisited - super lame).  It was good back then but obviously not perfect (and needed more).  They tried to fix it but I am not completely buying the direction they are going.  They keep giving you snippets of a characters event.  \n\nOn a good note, I particularly liked the Azir story - which was new narrative at the time.  The story was great.  It talked about his ascension and his relationship to other shurima champs, and at the end it was put all together.  It was a legit origin story which explains what Azir's goal is now.  With other stories however, like for example Swain (my favorite champ) did not go well.  I was waiting to hear a legit origin story and it just came out flat.  Same with Kai'sa and others.  Bleh.  I stopped reading the universe.  They need to do one big origin story and clearly defines the champion AND THEN they can pump out short stories.

I love the Dragon Age world for example, ignoring the story they were trying to force on us in DA:I about Solas the Liar, the whole world they built including a vast history timeline of events up to a year and sometimes day in that year is impressive. DA known history can be found nearly exclusively in the first game as well, with little panels and books telling it. You could then re-read this history in game. Over time with additional games, novels, comics the narrative has expanded hugely, adding new parts but sticking to the same concepts and explanations. The only realy mysteries in it are things that are kept ambiguious for narrative reasons, The Maker, Black/Golden City etc but even then those are explained what they are even if not why they are.\n\nIn League, the lore is getting more expansive, more defined as well as it's fleshed out but it's a painfully slow process plus none of it is available in game or even on the client. It's hidden away on a section of this website. There isn't an expanding series of comics or Novels exploring characters personalities and adventures. Most characters have a short bio followed by a story, if they are new (older ones just have a bio). We don't know if many characters have ever actually met (if they ever will), if their timeline is out of sync etc. \n\nWe have a lot of unknowns that don't and won't affect gameplay. Why is Diana in Ionia? Will Skarner actually get to Piltover and save the Crystals? Why is Jhin headed there and will Zed and co find him? Will there be a confrontation?\n\nThe recent Yas and Riven story is the perfect example. Yasuo's exile and Riven's history were both unexplored narrative and in one well thought out series of short stories they explained it, added character development and yet didn't change the in game characters at all or people's liking (or dislike :-P) of them.\n\nThey need more of this.

The biggest problem for me is how little of the lore actually makes sense. Most decisions made by the narrative team seem to be based off of the rule of cool, and the reasoning is too often just \"because magic\". Why the hell is Nautilus 50 feet tall? Why does Aurelion Sol range from the size of a star system to the size of a jumbo jet? Why does Malphite range from the size of a mountain to the size of an ordinary human? How was Pyke able to come back from the dead? Why was Tryndamere's rage enough to grant him immortality? What does immortality even mean in a world where spirits and afterlives and reincarnation are the norm -  a world where genuine death never seems to actually even occur? If the Darkin were so easy to kill that they were wiped out to the last five, why are they then described as immortal, and why did the last five have to remain trapped in weapons instead of being destroyed after the weapons had served their purpose? Why should we fear the Darkin or the Void or the Watchers when all three of these \"Big Bads\" had their asses handed to them in Runeterran history? The Darkin were trapped inside their weapons, like chumps. The Watchers were pushed off a bridge, like chumps. And we're supposed to believe they're the biggest threats to the world - I mean, seriously?\n\nI could go on and on, but what's the point? All I'll say to the Riot narrative team is, sure, you may have a cult-like following on these boards, but these boards are a *tiny* fraction of the total player-base. Most League fans don't care about the lore, because it's not been fleshed out enough to make any kind of sense. If you want the League lore to be taken seriously outside of these boards, you have to explain the whys and hows. Start with the fundamentals. Give us canonical sizes for Malphite, Aurelion Sol, etc. Explain mortality in Runeterra - who comes back as a ghost, who gets reincarnated, who receives oblivion, and why? Answer once and for all why the last five Darkin had to be trapped within weapons. Explain why the Freljordians are so terrified of the Watchers despite handily defeating them. Integrate such explanations into the game itself so people don't have to scour the Web just to understand what the hell is going on - loading screens are great opportunities. Above all, try to make sense. And please, try not to explain problems away as \"magic\".\n\n(PS: ignore upvotes and downvotes on posts.
