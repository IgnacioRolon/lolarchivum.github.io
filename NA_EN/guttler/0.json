You are still capped at earning 12 keys in a single month, which it does seem like you hit!  You have earned 12 fragments within the past rolling 30 days.  You should be able to earn one in the near future however, so keep playing and keep an eye out!\n\nHopefully this info helps a bit ^.^  Let me know if you have any further questions!","replies":[]}]}
