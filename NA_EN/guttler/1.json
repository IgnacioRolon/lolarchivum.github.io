(Keyfrags and Honor)","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My account is pretty old, I remember when the old school honor system came out and I'm pretty certain that I did earn one or two honor ribbons; but this had to be years ago. Are you going to reward players who earned honor ribbons even if they were prior to season 6/early season 7? The FAQ on the honor rewards doesn't do a good job of explaining this.\r\n\r\nHow do honor capsule count towards the monthly key fragment limit. I got an honor capsule and opened it to get two key fragments. Do those count as 2 of my 12 for the month or since it was out of the capsule, does the capsule only replace one key fragment meaning I've only gotten 1 out of my 12?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-08-30T15:41:41.057+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"We just [announced](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/features/old-honor-rewards) rewards for player who participated in the old honor system, with summoner icons rolled out by the 30th of next month.  Honor Capsules do count towards your key fragment limit, so the capsule acts as a replacement of a key fragment drop and would count towards the 12 per ~28 days.  I hope that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"AnataBakka","date":"2017-08-30T15:53:24.122+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i thought it only counted as 1 key fragment, not more, from the stuff @Broporo said","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-08-30T16:03:01.535+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Clarified, thank you!","replies":[]}]}]}]}
