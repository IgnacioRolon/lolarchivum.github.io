These subclasses serve to put similar champions next to one another to see if they are truly unique or if Riot needs to work on giving them their own gameplay identity. They are NOT little boxes Riot is trying to shove every single Champion into. Rengar being a diver is not going to prevent them from giving the jump from stealth gameplay that Rengar players love. Karma or LB don't suddenly have different playstyles. Zyra is not going to instantly become unviable anywhere but support just because she's in a so-called \"support\" subclass.
