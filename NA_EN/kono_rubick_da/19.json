It's obviously the best summoner spell and nearly everyone runs it because of this.  If there are champ abilities that mimic or surpass it with much lower cooldowns, it seems very comparable to me because quick mobility is one of the most powerful things in the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Mecha MaIphite","date":"2015-07-24T22:53:01.664+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Summoner spells are meant to give you that extra _pow_ right when you need it. For example, champions that take Ignite will only save it for when they're going in for a kill (or in teamfights against targets with heavy sustain). Most of these champions will have an ability that does roughly the same amount of damage as ignite. Just for this example, I'll use Malzahar E. The cooldown isn't super high, so you are free to use it to farm and harass your lane opponent. But you don't ignite people to harass them, because the whole purpose of ignite is for an all-in.\n\nFlash is the same thing. LeBlanc is notorious for her mobility, and she has two dashes and two blinks built in to her kit. Sometimes, that might not be enough though, (especially if she uses R for a different ability). In that case, one well-used flash can secure a kill, or help her get away from her opponents.","replies":[{"poster":"InsaneSamurai","date":"2015-07-24T23:10:37.720+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Puddinglax,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=7l88vQKd,comment-id=0001000000000000,timestamp=2015-07-24T22:53:01.664+0000)\n>\n> Summoner spells are meant to give you that extra _pow_ right when you need it.
