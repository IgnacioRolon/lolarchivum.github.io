Specifically in the case of Mordekaiser. To be clear - the better damage item for him is the Hextech Gunblade. But the WotA is still a legitimate item on him - in fact, I build it quite often when i'm trying to be more of an AP off-tank rather than a straight Ap carry.\n\nYes, he has no mana. However, his ability to push waves and sustain himself is a huge part of his power budget. Healing off of minions is a big part of how he lanes so well. He has zero cc and very little in the way of teamfighting ability, not to mention next to zero mobility (except in specific scenarios where the W can be used effectively).\n\nMoreover, Morde has no interest in attacking tanky targets at any time - his goal is to get after the damage dealers and try to turn them into powerful ghosts.\n\nPretty much the only part of you points in favor of the change that really benefits Morde is the reliance on base stats rather than stacking a lot of penetration. \n\nBasically, i understand the changes, but I also think the points you make about how it's meant to be balanced don't apply to every champ that uses it. Mordekaiser's power budget is significantly affected by these changes and the benefits don't really do much for him.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Abyssphere","date":"2015-07-02T00:24:25.090+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They're changing it to make it less snowbally.
