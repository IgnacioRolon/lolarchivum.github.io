If you are on the blue side, the purple team’s top jungle should be yours. Try to steal their golems, wraiths, and red buff (usually 13 minutes) constantly after you have pushed your lane. On the purple side, you should try to steal wolves and blue buff whenever possible. Constantly focus on applying pressure to both jungle and top lane.\n\n>Your mid game goal is to destroy and constantly push your lane that the enemy jungler and mid lane comes top to gank. When this happens, and you are sure you can’t escape, just fight and take one of them down. It will be a 1 for 1 trade. While you are 1v2/1v3ing top, your jungler and mid laner can roam bot or even take dragon if it’s up. Basically you are ‘distracting’ the enemy team so your team can get ahead by taking objectives.\n\n>tldr; Main idea mid game is to keep pushing, take enemy jungle and control top.

Rito?) and {{champion:131}}. \n\nThere are a lot of champs on this list that could either use help or need something unique in their kit so they stand out more (not to mention a VU or two...{{champion:80}} **HINT**), which is why Riot was choosing between them and assassins, but assassins won out cause they said that assassins are at a point where they can't even make anymore till the class is updated.\n\nSkirmishers ({{champion:114}} {{champion:92}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:23}} {{champion:11}} {{champion:24}} {{champion:245}} and {{champion:41}}) might see some adjustments with the assassin update since {{champion:245}} was on the list and are under the new \"Slayer\" class with assassins. Other than that, it would likely be a while before they see any work. \nThe class after Divers at the moment looks to be damage tanks since they haven't mentioned any other classes on the table and with how slow class updates are, we wouldn't see an update till 2018 at this point unless they change their minds between now and the diver update sometime next year.\n\n**TL;DR**: \nRiot has some plans for roughly half of the melee carries in the works, but it won't be till next year...

After all, she's someone who sneaks into or just flat-out runs into the team's squishies and sticks onto them until either her target or herself dies; hell, her ultimate isn't assassin in the slightest, given it's entire % current health damage, its massive slow, and the shield it gives her.
