So much. I&#039;m not sure if it&#039;s because people suck at her, or because people just flat out think she&#039;s bad. That, I do not know. What I do know is? I love her. I think she&#039;s in a great spot. Her kit is in a great area where she can poke the living crap out of her lane opponent, and survive ganks if she can play her w right. She&#039;s got tons of counter play, but also a fantastic-ly high skill cap.\r\n\r\nHowever, I have noticed many people being thoroughly disappointed, and whining their asses off because riot took away their untargetable, counterless ultimate, which most of the lol community hates. I&#039;d like to note that, honestly?\r\nYou&#039;re doing great. The champion you designed? Fantastic.\r\n\r\nAll of what you, as a company, have done, is great. \r\nYou&#039;ve built this wonderful game that I can call home, regardless of how mad or happy it may make me, it&#039;s home. \r\nIt holds a community. A fantastic community that, despite the negative aspects of it, I wouldn&#039;t trade for all the precious metals in the world.\r\nNow as much as a community may rage at you, as much as they may hate you, I wanna say that you, as a company, have done something astounding, being that you&#039;ve created the most popular game in the world, and continue to provide it with ever-greater content that thoroughly shines bright. \r\nI wanna say not to ever take what the community says in a negative way, and that above all you should always recognize that some of us here still love what others may hate.\r\nWhat some may think is &#039;too hard&#039;, or &#039;impossible&#039;, the truly skilled players may also think of as too easy. \r\n\r\nThis game is a great game I absorb myself in. \r\nI guess what I&#039;m trying to say is, keep doing you, boo. :)","replies":[{"poster":"RowanEnd","date":"2015-08-09T04:44:29.835+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":4,"body":"Fun game, but its problematic;\n\n1.

Something that only focuses on bullying the opponent out enough, but Morde's melee attacks, crippled damage, lack of CC or gap closers really make you question if this was worth it. I haven't played it personally, but just from looking at statistics and at CertainlyT's past work leaves me a bit concerned, to say the least.\n\nI also think it's ridiculous that CT is calling Morde unhealthy. CT, the same person responsible for advancing the Mobility Creep a thousand fold with Spear Bitch (at least she isn't as impossible to catch as she used to be with her backwards hops), calling Morde unhealthy. I get it, Morde was pretty awkward in balance, but CT has no right to say that without looking like a humongous hypocrite.","replies":[{"poster":"macromite","date":"2015-08-09T06:10:00.961+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":6,"body":"the thing that people like you seem to not know about mordekaiser is that even though it seems like he's going to be bad, in the right comps he will literally make just about any adc cry. people look at his resource and think that he'll need a sustain, and that is terribad, but pair him up with a leona or a thresh, someone who lets you get in range, and think of the damage you will get to put out because you don't have good mobility or range. people think morde won't be able to farm, but again this is wrong, his shield easily stops pretty much any low damage harass, like a few auto's the adc would throw,  and his damage at close quarters stops him from getting pulled in by a blitz or a naut to stop him. \n\nThe thing about CT is that even though pretty much everything he touches is absolute cancer, it's never weak. he touches morde, morde is not going to be weak. CT is a somewhat terrible game designer that should try harder to make champions fun to play against, but he makes champions that are fun to play, and they are always retarded strong.\n\nI was probably a bit harsh in my first comment here, I'm sick of people calling things weak when they probably don't even know about the strengths of weaknesses apparent in any specific champion.","replies":[{"poster":"Baron of Bread","date":"2015-08-09T08:27:46.717+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"We aren't worried about him being weak; when we say he will be destroyed we are talking about his identity.

Morde, if we were going purely off of his personality to taunt everyone else that's not him, including the ~~summoners~~ players, Morde would be more akin to a Vayne main that prefers 1v5 pentakills to teamwork. Which, I mean, if we're going off of the stereotype that all ADC mains are pretentious assholes, then I guess it would work sending Morde there. But even still, he would not be the character who asks for help, he'd be the one who smacks a mace in their face and denies the usage of a support.\n\nI mean, his name has \"Kaiser\" in it, which is German for King, and derives from Caeser.
