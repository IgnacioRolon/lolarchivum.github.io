I mean Sona pokes so hard from afar that champions like Katarina, Leblanc, and Akali can't put up with it. When you have your ult up it's usually a guaranteed kill as well. Heck I've gotten triple kills off of it.\n\nHer powerful pokes that only increase when she gets a Lich Bane, Sustain, Versatility in general, and godly teamfighting I would say totally makes her not a bad mid laner and I would definitely choose her (or Viktor my bae) over most other mid lane champions.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"LankPants","date":"2015-04-13T11:40:04.211+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":">I mained her for like 120 games, I wouldn't really say she was overpowered as a support but she was top tier mid laner and was absolutely impossible to beat in lane and in most dueling cases as long as she had ultimate.

She wasn't nerfed because she was oppressive mid lane, she was barely even viable mid. She was nerfed because Riot has some insane vendetta against her for some reason.","replies":[{"poster":"qetzel","date":"2015-04-13T19:50:53.071+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"It may be because she is above average in all the metrics in the above diagram except for deaths.
