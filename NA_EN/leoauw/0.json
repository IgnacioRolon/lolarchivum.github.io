One of the big is issues is that this skin was supposed to be released weeks ago. I hope you guys can spend a little bit of your time reading this letter and manage to solve this inconvenient  since it would be a nice job.\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely, Leoauw.{{sticker:fiora-cool}} {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2017-11-30T17:12:20.668+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi! \n\nDue to a store issue, Lancer Paragon and Lancer Rogue Blitzcrank skins won't be available until 7.24. \n\n{{sticker:sg-janna}}","replies":[{"poster":"leoauw","date":"2017-12-02T01:29:23.681+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"UNDERSTANDABLE, thanks for letting me know","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2017-12-04T16:49:11.093+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No problem! :)","replies":[]}]}]}]}
