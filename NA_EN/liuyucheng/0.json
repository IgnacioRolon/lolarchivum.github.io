We have a fix for this, but since it's not a super critical bug we won't be deploying it until the next patch.\n\nSorry about that :( but if you avoid upgrading right after the passive goes down (12 second window), it should be okay.\n\nIf you find another way to make this happen, let me know~","replies":[{"poster":"Krushings","date":"2015-08-13T05:48:05.264+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"yo. sated aatrox is bugged. his w doesnt proc at times. please look into this issue.
