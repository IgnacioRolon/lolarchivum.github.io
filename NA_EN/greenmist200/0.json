It shouldn't be too hard to just go on a 5k screen, and adjust the size of everything just the way it would look on a 1980x1080 screen. I'm currently using 2xxx x 1xxx resolution because if I put it any higher, the mouse becomes smaller, the health bars become smaller - aka it becomes unplayable. So in fact, I have to give up on quality just for the sake of gameplay. Why can't I have both?

I certainly don't have a timeline on when this will come out since I don't work on the teams that deploy these features, but I recommend keeping an eye on the [**News Page**](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/) for any sort of official announcement regarding it.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]}]}
