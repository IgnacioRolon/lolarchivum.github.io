She still has the same inherent weaknesses as before, such as being heavily punished by cc. But because of her new kit a good kat player could set herself up to escape if she doesn't get focused while locked down, but then it comes down to her outplaying you. Thus accomplishing the point of the assassin reworks. Widen burst windows (which they most certainly accomplished on kat), give assassins more outplay potential (higher skill floor and cap) and make it so the enemies playing against them can say \"I was outplayed\" and not \"there was nothing I can do\". There is counter play to her kit, but people don't realize that a majority of her late game damage comes from her daggers as her Q and E don't scale that much on their own. If she can't pick up daggers or you avoid getting hit by them, a lot of her damage is gone. Her movements are also often highly telegraphed due to her need to pick up her daggers, skill shots now become easier to land because her enemies often have a good idea of where she will be shunpo'ing to next. Similar to draven, you see where his axe is gonna land so he will either have to drop the axe or take a Morgana Q to the face. I do believe she is strong, but I wouldn't say broken. If Riot chose to nerf her I would say base damage nerfs are the best way to go, cause to be honest I've already gone semi tanky builds with stuff like sun fire and still done a ton of damage and I don't want kat to turn into another tank Ekko monstrosity.","replies":[{"poster":"Dreadlocks","date":"2017-01-10T15:40:57.486+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"based on my experience Ill have to disagree.. sure she has to do all those things but it's at the point of, do I have point and click lock down, not just, do I have cc... cuz she jumps around far more than she did before and her damage is still very impressive when in the right hands..

Only a really good kat player is gonna be able to be slippery enough to avoid numerous cc skill shots. Not to mention the fact of what kind of cc you have if any at all has nothing to do with whether or not she is too strong. It is one of her weaknesses but if you don't draft any hard cc after she's picked or she is picked because you didn't draft any hard cc is no different than any other draft strategy. People pick certain champs based on the enemy comp all the time. Olaf into a bunch of hard cc for example. Or sivir in a hard engage comp. So to say that if you don't have point and click cc then it's hard to kill her is kinda a lost argument cause if you don't have cc who's fault is that, not hers. So I guess the real argument is where do we draw the line between a champ being hard to play and how effective they are when someone knows how to play them well. Look at Azir and Kalista, both champs are hard to play but they ended up being too strong when played well and now they are both in the gutter. So I guess we have to assess whether kat is too good when played correctly. Personally If they were to nerf her I would say base damages could go down a little so she isn't too strong at lvl 3. And I think the auto reset on shunpo can go as well.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"KraDEsluP282","date":"2017-01-09T20:34:36.947+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":4,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Ralanr,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=BP7t6xzc,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-01-09T20:33:43.599+0000)\n>\n> She&#x27;s an assassin right?\n\nbut she's too strong right now","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CerealBoxOfDoom","date":"2017-01-09T20:34:04.776+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"whats wrong with it?\n\nis 50% ok?
