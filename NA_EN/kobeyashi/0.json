The ban system SHOULD NOT BE automated and is WAY too severe somtimes and sometimes WAY too lenient. There are GROUPS of toxic players that will harass and mock and BULLY people into saying things that SEEM toxic and then report them. I have known a NUMBER of people that this happened to.\n\nthey need to make it 50% player based judging WITHOUT summoner names to make it impartial and 50% moderator judged. I think what they should do is \n\n1. put a case out there and randomly send 100 players a \"invitation\" to log into the website and judge a case. Players that are seen as more fair by the game moderators are asked more often. Once you give your verdict you get 1000 blue or orange essence.\n\n2.  Grade the reports on severity  into THREE levels. lvl 1 severity is minor insults, critisizms and so on lvl 2 is mocking verbal harassment lvl 3 is racism, homophobic comments and or harassment along with any type of racism.\n\n3. Once BOTH the players AND the moderators have spoken the tally FOR and AGAINST are combined and the final decision is done and punishment is given.\n\n4. ALL PARTICIPANTS NEED TO BE ABLE TO BE PUNISHED often a player is NORMALLY a good sport but can be PUSHED or HARASSED into BEING toxic if a group of players harassed the player into being toxic and then reported him THEY need to be punished NOT HIM.\n\n5. There should be two categories that are known ONLY to game moderators the \"recoverable\" players and the players that are SO TOXIC they can be banned without worrying about it. the \"redeemable\" players should be given more leeway but ONLY judged by at least THREE moderators and if it's a severe punishment the player can ask for a ONE TIME \"second chance\" of three DIFFERENT moderators to vote on the same situation. \n\nEVERY situation should be treaded as a unique event because some poeple just have a bad day or run into a herd of toxic trolls in a row or even the same troll many games in a row. There should aslo be \"blue essence\" penalties with the ability to go into the negative.\n\nIf people are penalized blue essence  or orange essence for being toxic they will be more likely to stop.","replies":[{"poster":"Leetri","date":"2017-12-22T06:24:55.079+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":2,"body":"The ban system absolutely has to be automatic or you wouldn't see players getting banned until a couple of years later because of the sheer amount of reports being sent.

In addition to the general time you would also want multiple people to look at the same case, probably 3 pairs of eyes over time.

But this low life human being actually exists.  Oh and want some salt on the wound? When we won the game at the end he said for everyone to report us and that he did all of the work...oh boy he didnt even look at the scoreboards to see that I got top healing and Seris was just under me. \n> That is actual toxicity. That is actually perma ban worthy. Not just calling someone a moron. You can just laugh that off like &quot;yeah what ever buddy keep saying that it will get you far&quot; and you move on. If he continues to act like that just chat restrict him. He isn&#x27;t being toxic he is just being a distraction to the game and banning him is not really needed. \n> I am afraid to say anything in this game now. I cant make a joke without fear that someone will take it the wrong way. I cant tell someone to leave someone else alone if they are harassing them. You cant tell someone what they are doing wrong without being called bossy and being reported. \n> You cant do anything. Your player base should not be afraid to use the chat. Why should we be afraid to talk to people in a game where fun is ment to be had. Its not fun riot. Fun does not equal fear from the people who are ment to be protecting you when you are hurting the players more.\n> I came into this game with high hopes after D day with paladins and honestly...you have disappointed me riot. I am not expecting the game or anything else like that to be perfect but this is saddening. I heard great things about you and I am realizing that they are no longer true.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"lnsaneeez","date":"2017-12-22T20:16:50.435+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, basically the game has become antisocial.

I don't know how much worse it has actually gotten in League recently as its community is about as sensitive as you can get, but the thought of being banned for calling someone \"bad\" in any other online game I've ever played would be considered laughable and absurd. Only in League have I ever seen players believe things like that being ban worthy.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Onandaga","date":"2017-12-22T17:58:19.794+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Personally I'm glad to see that salty players are getting the punishment they deserve. There is really no excuse for souring other people's games by calling them trash and handing out all sorts of other insults. Its basic human manners that everyone should of been taught in school and/or their parents. If someone is playing poorly and/or annoying you, you either restrain yourself from the chat box and suck it up or flame and accept the consequences that come after.
