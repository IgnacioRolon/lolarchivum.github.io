Upon arriving, he Stun icon suspends all nearby Airborne icon airborne enemies for 1 second and deals them physical damage.\r\nPHYSICAL DAMAGE: 200 / 300 / 400 (+ 150% bonus AD)\r\nFor the next 15 seconds, Yasuo ignores 50% of his targets&#039; bonus armor. Casting Last Breath clears all stacks of Gathering Storm \r\n\r\nMy suggestion:\r\n\r\n&gt; ACTIVE: Yasuo blinks to the nearest visible Airborne icon airborne enemy champion to the cursor, instantly generating maximum Flow. Upon arriving, he Stun icon suspends all nearby Airborne icon airborne enemies for 1 second and deals them physical damage.\r\nPHYSICAL DAMAGE: 200 / 300 / 400 (+ 150% bonus AD)\r\nFor the next 15 seconds, Yasuo ignores **5%(+ crit chance from outside sources capping at 55%)** of his targets&#039; bonus armor. Casting Last Breath clears all stacks of Gathering Storm \r\n\r\n\r\nEssentially, I want the armor pen from his ult to scale with the crit from his items or runes. Forcing yas to either build crit if he wants that pen from the ult. Numbers may not be exactly what&#039;s needed  but those could be fixed.","replies":[{"poster":"IronwallJackson","date":"2016-08-14T10:03:12.103+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"@PermabannedGaren is right, Yasuo's base damages are fucking abysmal. Like most ADCs do, he scales with gold, not level, so he actually becomes less proportionately effective to his lane opponents the more they drag out the first back.","replies":[{"poster":"NotSpecialDude","date":"2016-08-14T13:22:11.629+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I figured as much but it is a bit frustrating that my nerf suggestion is getting overlooked because I was wrong about something else.\n\nI just want to know, is the ult nerf ok?","replies":[{"poster":"IronwallJackson","date":"2016-08-14T23:01:39.000+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sure, I suppose. It's as good enough a way as any to discourage his non-crit bruiser builds as any I can think of. Locking him out of his arpen unless he crits might also work.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"GULAG 4 U","date":"2016-08-14T01:02:47.123+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1. it's yasuo, not yasou. \n\n2.
