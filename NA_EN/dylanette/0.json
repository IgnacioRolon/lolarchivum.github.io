I looked some stuff up and turns out posting this fixed it, I can reply, and everything is fine - except the top right corner still says my old name (The Only Voling) and going to my Boards Profile fixed it. Changing the URL to Unceasing instead of The Only Voling lets me go there but I'm sure the system will resolve that.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-08T23:46:38.176+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Everything looks up to date right now!
