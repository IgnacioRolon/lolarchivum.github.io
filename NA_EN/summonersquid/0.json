IMO it's best to just start playing now. There's no better practice for ranked matches... than just playing ranked matches.

My reason for not doing this was that I heard many players don't take ranked play (at least in silver where I'll likely start out in placements) very seriously at the end of the season because it won't affect them as much as normal or for as long?  \n\nMind you,  even if I go something terrible like 2-8 in placements,  after the s5 reset I'd probably only be 1 or 2 Games below average so maybe it's really worth the experiment (although now I'm not sure if I'll get 10 matches in before s5, I'd need at least a week... It could be as early as tomorrow couldn't it? )","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ValyrianBlade","date":"2015-01-12T18:22:48.731+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cool, good to know.\n\nSo as someone who has never done ranked before and who is waiting until after the upcoming rune page and runes sale to start ranked (to rid myself of disadvantages as much as possible), should I actually wait a lot longer to start ranked?\n\nMy thought being, after the reset my \"league average\" MMR will be a lot closer to players that are way above average skill level, and I'll get more difficult placement matches. If I wait a few weeks after the season starts, I'll (hopefully) get placed with only the average skilled players and will likely win more matches and get a better placement? \n\nOr, if Bronze and Silver are really as riddled with trolls and luck-based (which team is the troll on) as people tend to claim they are, am I better off playing right away and hoping to get matched with better players in my placements so as to avoid trolls? \n\nI'm also curious what happens when you dodge while in a placement match? Is it counted as a loss (the same as a promotional match), or is it just a time penalty (the same as a normal match) since dodging a ranked match is only supposed to cost a few LP but doesn't lower your MMR (which is all that placements look at). \n\nThanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Spreek","date":"2015-01-12T22:50:51.298+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're better off playing when the reset happens.\n\nThe games will be lower variance when you play with other people that are relatively experienced in ranked. If you don't do well, at least you'll be placed appropriately (Being placed too high and losing 20+ games miserably as you fall down to your true rating isn't very fun either).\n\nIf you wait, you'll be paired with a mix of completely new players who may or may not have rune pages and smurfs. Those games are very high variance and you are more likely to end up far from your true rating.","replies":[{"poster":"ValyrianBlade","date":"2015-01-12T23:01:57.204+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's a good way to look at it I guess. \n\nI was under the impression that a new ranked player was put with anyone at league average mmr though,  so low silver players for my placements.

In rare cases, you can get paired with regular rated players, but 99% of the time you'll be with other people in their placements.","replies":[{"poster":"ValyrianBlade","date":"2015-01-12T23:14:37.854+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks!
