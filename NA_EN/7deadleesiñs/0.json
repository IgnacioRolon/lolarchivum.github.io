I got my account suspended for about 2 weeks. Since then, I have had trouble getting my honor level up. Not because I haven't been reforming to the standards that League of Legends considers acceptable, but because my teammates aren't giving me honor. I don't really even talk much in games anymore. Still, when I do talk and I am helpful, most players give honor to either no one, a random player, or the player that did the best on the team (their opinion). So, where does that leave people that move the game forward strategically but may not be KDA players? I believe Riot should implement some sort of system in which players that have been punished, have a chance to regain honor in a clear cut way. Either by posting to forums in ways that Riot and the community deem as helpful, or by asking the teammates directly via a popup questionnaire after the game. This keeps the player not only accountable for the mistake that they made after punishment is gone, but gives them an opportunity to gain honor and get better teammates themselves. Punishment is necessary for players that get a little hot headed and ruin other people's experiences, but League of Legends is a game. Past offenders should have a right to reform in a seamless transition. That way League of Legends can be fun for us again too. I look forward to reading comments on this. I hope that some people can agree that a few mistakes shouldn't define a LOL player. Especially when they do put in effort to improve.\r\n\r\nI understand my ideas aren't perfect and have the potential for exploitation, in some minor ways. My main objective in writing this, is to get people talking about it more.\r\n\r\nI would like to point out a potential bias of mine. I have Asperger's Syndrome, and may just not understand what to say to teammates to earn honor in general. So, I'm not sure if this article will appeal to the mainstream, or just a handful of people like me. That said, I'd love to hear thoughts your thoughts on the matter. Thanks for reading.{{sticker:sg-ahri-2}}","replies":[{"poster":"rujitra","date":"2019-12-22T21:44:29.032+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So... you want a popup questionnaire after the game.. which is exactly what they have now? They literally have a popup that lasts quite a while and has to be intentionally skipped or ignored. If you aren't getting honors, then obviously the other players aren't thinking you're the most honorable.\n\nYou can claim that other people don't honor you because they simply honor whoever had the best KDA... but that's simply untrue. I've gotten most honorable in many games where I had one of the worst KDAs on the team. Players will honor those who keep the team together, help the team to victory, and who don't tilt in the face of losing lane - regardless of KDA.\n\nIf you haven't been climbing in honor over the course of 3-4 months of active play, it is because you are still misbehaving in some games. While honors from others and the \"full team honor bonus\" (when all teammates select *someone* else to honor, regardless of who) help a little, you can progress in honor without ever being honored by teammates. Honor is designed to be a full season climb though - while some people will get Honor 5 by summertime each season, they are in the minority of either extremely active players or extremely well behaved. You will climb a checkpoint every 2-4 weeks of active play or so - unless you are misbehaving in games still.\n\nIt isn't designed to be a fast climb. You aren't intended to just magically get back a high honor level after a punishment. You lost Riot's \"trust\" - and just like in real life it takes a **LONG** time to earn it back.","replies":[{"poster":"7DeadLeeSiñs","date":"2019-12-26T23:01:05.597+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Listen, I'm not suggesting I didn't deserve punishment. I definitely deserved it. Also, with all due respect, you can't say people don't honor me because of KDA. When I have the highest KDA and carry wins, I get honored more often than when I don't. I've taken time to test this theory. There have been games where I was toxic, in the past, (before my reform), but carried to the gift of honors. To say it is, 'simply untrue', is based on your own personal bias. You also don't know which game types I play most often. Without properly conducting a controlled study, your claim has no validity. Still, that being besides the point, I'm suggesting they add alternative ways for people to gain honor. For example, the message boards. Helping other players, etc.. Why should honor be a full season climb if I don't play the game as much as I used to? Why should I be punished for having a life? It just doesn't seem like a good system. No system is ever perfect, and everything can be improved. I learned that when I reformed. I just happen to think that personal growth is worth more than trying to quietly impress four people I will never meet again. People that have their own flaws, mind you. Riot puts me with players that have low honor, like me, i'd wager. These are things that should be considered.

Quickly earning honor represents regularly positive behavior, but there's no acknowledgement of that.\n\nSo by the very nature of honors, having been punished, it is the expectation that you're not going to be honor 5 anytime soon. Still, keep playing with honor and it will come back eventually. Broken trust is hard to repair, and will not be forgotten.","replies":[{"poster":"rujitra","date":"2019-12-22T21:52:37.182+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Nightsky Pirate,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=mvYVVNzt,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2019-12-22T21:51:50.253+0000)\n>\n> As Rujita said (saying that a lot lately...)\n\n######hey you had a full 20 minutes to respond before i did to avoid having to say that","replies":[{"poster":"Nightsky Pirate","date":"2019-12-22T21:57:31.010+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In other words, I've been appreciating what you said and wanted to add to it...\nIt appears I'm going bro on you. \n{{sticker:sg-ezreal}}","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"NF Remilia","date":"2019-12-23T07:02:07.402+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As long as you dont wishing your teammates death.

Having a positive chat and getting tram progress bonus progresses the chat alot more than getting honored.  \n\nNote that you can progress honors if you don't use chat at all, just that positive chat accelerates the progress alot more. On the flip side, using chat negatively will drastically slow down your honors progress. ","replies":[]}]}
