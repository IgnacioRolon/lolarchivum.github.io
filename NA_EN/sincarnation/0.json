When I heard there was going to be a jungle item for counter-jungling I was super hyped, but then Poacher's came out and it was just underwhelming.  I'm a Gold III (yay placements) jungle main with a secondary focus on mid lane, and the primary counter jungler I would/do play is Shyvana.\nhttp://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-history/NA1/43063556?champion=102\n\nSo far it seems like every new jungle item except Poachers has had its time to shine, Stalker when it had 50% slow, Skirmisher on Warwick, and Rangers with the smite CDR.  I would imagine this is due to the nature of the unique smites each one gives.\n\nRangers - There is never a bad time for blasting smite, you can smite your own camps or lane minions and it is still good.  Gives sustain and clear speed to anyone who needs it.\n\nStalkers - There is rarely a bad time for chilling smite, it helps your ganks and can add some much needed utility to some champions.  Rarely a time when you can't use chilling smite optimally which is simply aiding in a fight.\n\nSkirmishers - Largely the same as stalkers when it comes to useage, but this one has also seen a bit of a drop off since the changes.  It is very strong in the 1 v 1 dueling situations it was intended to be used in, but it suffers from what I think is the same problem as poacher's except to a far lesser extent.\n\nPoachers - There is rarely a GOOD time for scavenging smite, and when you do get to counter jungle the punishment/reward isnt really there. This is a problem considering how much harder counter jungling is compared to the other smites, there are more situations where you can't counter-jungle.   That seems to be the similar issue with skirmishers.  There are times when the enemy team members are too strong to 1 v 1 and in that case your most of your jungle purchase basically was invalidated.  With poachers the problem is the risk of encountering the other jungle, the chances of being collapsed on, and the chances of their camps being down aren't worth the reward/punishment when stacked with the fact that Poachers is the only smite that you can be completely shut out of using the effect other that it being smite.  At least with skirmishers you can smite them for the damage reduction.\n\nNow I understand not decreasing jungle timers so as to keep counter jungling rewarding, but what about instead of making it more accessible making it more rewarding?  Typically when I counter jungle the scavenging smite rewards are largely non-factors, I think most people counter-jungle when they know the position of the enemy jungler so the speed boost for the escape is rarely necessary.  The +20 gold is nice, but unless you completely control their jungle and lanes to the point you can free farm their jungle, I would be surprised if someone got more than 200 gold from that part of the smite.  Plus I feel counter jungling is more about denial than it is your own advancement even though it does both, but that might just be a personal feeling.  The smite CD reduction is a step in the right direction. and it is something I think could be expanded.  At that point if you arent worrying about the rewards why are you using Poacher's smite over Rangers?\n\nHere are my proposals for Scavenging Smite buffs, these are individual not both.\n\nSlash and Burn - Smiting an enemy jungle camp visibly scars the land, marking it, after the camp is fully cleared the spawn is delayed X amount of seconds.\nIt could make it more difficult for you to use their jungle as a source of income, but it can be really punishing if the enemy jungler spends too much time out of his jungle.\n\nFamine - Killing an enemy jungle monster you smited refunds the smite charge (might consume the monster buff though)\nThe idea here again is to really punish the enemy jungler for showing on the opposite side of the map without clearing their jungle.  You could see their J4 top and just take their entire bot side jungle (assuming dragon is down or risky).\n\nThe idea is to actually make junglers actually be leery of ganking while they have camps up.\n\n**If you don't want to go the more rewarding/punishing route maybe give Poacher's Smite ward charges.  Vision helps the team and makes counter-jungling safer and more reliable while not making it assured. **\n\nThats my 2 cents on the jungle items, and a bit on why Stalkers and Rangers are the main ones seeing use.\n\nWhy don't you guys use Poacher's Knife? Do you want it to be viable why or why not?  What are your ideas for buffs?\nHopefully someone from Riot can give some insight.\n\ntl;dr- Poacher's smite risk vs reward isn't balanced by the difficulty of counter jungling and the possibility of shut out from their jungle.\n\nedit 10/13/15: Pre-Season is coming, maybe we can get some more discussion?\nedit 10/30/15: We did it?

Though when i tried to relate that to the current jungle it seemed too unrealistic an idea for the non-professional scene, because you aren't in constant communication with your team I dont see how often/if ever that would work.  It sounds like a strategy that either worked flawlessly, completely starving the enemy jungler when you were ahead or failed miserably resulting in numerous collapses and you getting starved.  But those are just my thoughts from hearing about it.\n\nPersonally I'm really liking the information shift, and the idea someone added about the smite warding the camps with a 5 hit trinket ward sounded neat.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Axes","date":"2015-02-09T04:38:56.484+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd caution that there are still some larger discussions about the role of counterjungling that really have to be settled before deciding on something like making Poacher's Knife grant vision - it's a promising direction that I'm starting to investigate but it's something that could easily turn out badly.\n\nGlad to see discussion like this about it, though.","replies":[{"poster":"Sinlaire","date":"2015-02-09T18:10:19.014+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot Axes,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=K9iPZAb7,comment-id=000400010000,timestamp=2015-02-09T04:38:56.484+0000)\n>\n> I'd caution that there are still some larger discussions about the role of counter jungling that really have to be settled before deciding on something like making Poacher's Knife grant vision - it's a promising direction that I'm starting to investigate but it's something that could easily turn out badly.\n> \n> Glad to see discussion like this about it, though.\n\nWhat if smiting smiting lower river crab updated the status of the mini map on which buffs are open for that area? smite dragon crab and it shows Gromp is up but blue and wolves are down but only at the time of the smiting. Smiting an enemy jungle monster could also set your min map for all of the jungle monsters in the area. you missed blue but killed the Gromp and now your Tab Timer and mini map know when it comes up like the enemy jungler, but only lasting until the next respawn. You would have to poach on red side in order to get the timers on that side as well.\n\nThis would allow an active counter jungler to be as aware of the respawn rotation as the enemy jungler is but they only get it if they're actively poaching. This prevents giving them too much free information as it only allows access to knowledge of 1 spawn rotation from the last poach on the side you poached.\n\nThis would also allow the poacher to be more aware of what they'll find in the jungle instead of running blind and allow them to more consistently and quickly poach.\n\nThat could also lead to an entirely different jungle play style if the poacher is actively keeping tabs on both sides of the jungle and consciously weighing benefits of which side to poach, when, and where, if what routes they'll need to run if they need to support or gank a lane along the way.\n\nThis could essentially allow a poacher to be an entirely different play style from a typical jungler and open up a different aspect of jungle diversity by actually promoting tactical counter jungling instead of just promoting camp stealing.","replies":[{"poster":"Spacesuit Spiff","date":"2015-02-09T22:53:19.280+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I love this.

Since you can't use your smite  on your raptors to clear the enemy jungle defensive wards (only if you have 2 smites saved, wich that means that you aren't farming, especially in early game where smite is amust have)?\n\nCounter jungle won't leave the enemy jungler behind.He will catch up to you really fast with the whole jungle exp.\nCounter jungle used to work because EVEN if you didn't get a kill you would deny a lot of XP to the enemy jungle and you would get a lvl lead.\n\nAnother point is that buying the item is screaming out loud that you pretend to make ends meet in the enemy jungle, since you gave up on a free slow or a AOE clear that works better than poachers for clearing camps.\n\nYou should integrate poacher in skirmishers, nerf them a little bit, since you can counter jungle, choose to use the smite on the enemy jungle for a kill or just steal de buff (that isn't so worth it now days), or he can gank the lanes.  It gives option to the junger.  \n\nGiving vision or a ward isn't a really good option, since there is already a PBE upgrade that giver a charges to the upgraded yellow trinket and a temporary ward for the blue trinket. More vision makes the game stale and rewards low awareness players.\n\nIf the design team still think that vision is a must, maybe give it a passive like warwick E or rengar ! sign ult.

You clear the remaining small raptors or the enemy does. Later he comes by and it has respawned he smites it and the smite buff doesn't work. You had disabled it on respawn from your having poached it the prior time. Though once cleared, the followup respawn it works as normal, It is not permanently disabled, that would be rough.\n\nAnother Example, enemy is a type of champion that is often having trouble sustaining when clearing, and relies on the Red BrambleBack smite buff of 20% of max health to help clear the camp, yet you had counter poached it on the prior spawn so nothing happens for him on this respawn and he ends up potentially having trouble making it through the clear, having to back out and recall or dieing, etcetera. \n\nI notice at a site that talks about these smite buffs it seems there are some visual effects that give away whether a smite buff is available or not. So I guess it won't be a surprise unless they leave the visual effect intact to surprise the enemy when the smite buff fails to occur or he just gets to notice that it is missing and knows he won't get it but needs to clear his jungle anyway. I also guess you would need a 'poached' sound effect or visual effect on failure to illustrate that it wasn't a random game bug, but that he had been poached.\n\nI know under normal circumstances, if one jungler smites a camp but doesn't clear it, the smite buff will be inaccessible to the other jungler, but i'm extending it via poacher's knife to the next respawn as well. Also so as not to punish the poacher, the next buff's smite buff is always accessible regardless of whether poached and potentially even when smited by enemy to someone possessing a poacher's knife but only when used in opposing camps.\n\nOne other idea unrelated and separate to the above and similar to the idea of having a ward like the old spirit of the ancient golem jungle item: \n\nInstead of any of the above, the poacher's knife could have an active ability on high cooldown to set and lay a trap which becomes invisible after 1 second. The trap gives vision if it is stepped on, and applies a short duration slow. Similar to laying a teemo shroom. The goal is just to cover one point of entry or exit of a jungle to make it safer for yourself to enter and counterjungle and exit safely, incase there is a chance it is warded or occupied. \n\nTwo separate ideas.

Tough decision is tough!\n\nSo, I main jungle Shyvana, and ever since pre-season started, I have exclusively used poaching smite on her (with a very small handful of exceptions when my opponent is like, an Udyr or somebody similarly uncounter-junglable). These are my general thoughts and experiences using it.\n\nThe extra gold you gain from poaching an enemy camp is both very strong, and very hard to appreciate. Similar to auras actually. When it's happening, it doesn't feel like it's really having much of an impact, but at the end of the game I will consistently have the most gold overall of both teams, or very close to it, even when my score isn't especially great. If you can really get in there and take control of the enemy jungle, the gold gain is actually a HUGE benefit, but it doesn't feel as good or exciting as it actually should.\n\nWith the new smite charge system recently introduced, my early game invades allow me to take an entire section of the enemy jungle very quickly while being able to smite both (or even all 3 if blue/red is up) camps. Accumulating multiple jungle camp buffs is very easy this way, and on some rare occasions I've even managed having all jungle camp buffs simultaneously with it. And, as mentioned before, this can actually lead to huge gold gains. That said, this advantage tends to fall off as the game progresses.\n\nMy absolute favourite part of this smite though is the move speed buff. Holy hell is it fun. I love zooming around the enemy jungle with it, getting in and out faster than they know what happened. But the best is when they actually catch me in their jungle, and I kill the camp and race off too quick to be caught. Or even better, absolutely nothing is more satisfying than walking into the enemy jungle, walking right up to a camp while they're fighting it, stealing it with smite and running off in the blink of an eye. It is just so fun. More than anything else, I just love this huge move speed buff. It's incredibly satisfying and allows for some hilarious troll plays.\n\nThose are all my positive experiences, now for the negative, and what I feel are the two biggest flaws of the poaching smite.\n\nFirst, more than any other smite, scavenging smite has a tendency to fall off really hard late game. As the game goes on and my character becomes stronger, I can clear camps more easily and quickly. It reaches the point where earlier in the game I clear camps so quickly that I can't use smite on all of them anymore. This forces me to either deliberately slow down my clears (not a good idea when I'm in the enemy territory) or just accept that I actually get less of my smite's benefit later in the game. This is in contrast to the other smite's which generally still serve some use later on, whether it be to regen some hp/mana off of camps, or small form of CC or damage reduction in a fight. The poaching smite really only has value in the early game and very little late. Unfortunately, many junglers who wouldn't mind poaching smite are also the kind of junglers who want Devourer as their enchant, which means rushing the enchant as their first big item. Since a smite can't be exchanged for another one once it's enchanted, this means having to commit hard to it. Non-Devourer using junglers would at least have the option of saving their jungle enchant for a later item and swapping their smite out later, but they're also less likely to want to use scavenging smite in the first place. Simply being able to swap the poaching smite out for a different one even after it's been enchanted could go a long way towards helping its usability.\n\nWhich ties into the second big flaw with it, and that's that the poaching smite has no fallback pattern. Ranger's is always going to be efficient for farming, Stalker's and Skirmisher's will always have some sort of combat value, but if you or your team fall too far behind such that invading the enemy jungle becomes too great of a risk to afford, then Poacher's literally just does nothing at all. In that respect, it relies way too much on snowballing. You take it and you have to either go in there and dominate the enemy jungle, or it's just gonna get more and more useless.\n\nAll that said, while Poacher's does have some pretty serious flaws that need addressing, I'm gonna keep using it. Handled well and with a strong focus on warding, invading, and controlling the enemy jungle, it has the potential to be quite strong. Plus, seriously, that zoom zoom zoom move speed buff... Just so goddamned fun.","replies":[{"poster":"Sincarnation","date":"2015-02-09T15:37:46.644+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Gixia,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=K9iPZAb7,comment-id=00040004,timestamp=2015-02-09T10:33:21.265+0000)\n>\n> Not sure whether this post would get more general exposure replying to you or the OP.

It reaches the point where earlier in the game I clear camps so quickly that I can't use smite on all of them anymore. This forces me to either deliberately slow down my clears (not a good idea when I'm in the enemy territory) or just accept that I actually get less of my smite's benefit later in the game. This is in contrast to the other smite's which generally still serve some use later on, whether it be to regen some hp/mana off of camps, or small form of CC or damage reduction in a fight. The poaching smite really only has value in the early game and very little late. Unfortunately, many junglers who wouldn't mind poaching smite are also the kind of junglers who want Devourer as their enchant, which means rushing the enchant as their first big item. Since a smite can't be exchanged for another one once it's enchanted, this means having to commit hard to it. Non-Devourer using junglers would at least have the option of saving their jungle enchant for a later item and swapping their smite out later, but they're also less likely to want to use scavenging smite in the first place. Simply being able to swap the poaching smite out for a different one even after it's been enchanted could go a long way towards helping its usability.\n> \n> All that said, while Poacher's does have some pretty serious flaws that need addressing, I'm gonna keep using it. Handled well and with a strong focus on warding, invading, and controlling the enemy jungle, it has the potential to be quite strong. Plus, seriously, that zoom zoom zoom move speed buff... Just so goddamned fun.\n\nBaller, a fello Shyv player\n1. I'm fairly certain the increased gold is just from the nature of shyvana being a power farmer not from the poacher's smite.  Pretty much every game I play I feel stupidly far ahead, regardless of jungle item, just because I lived in both jungles, and remember you only get the gold when you smite their camps and assuming you only smite their camps (unlikely but lets roll with it) thats about an extra 20 gold per minute past the 4 minute mark. an extra 320 gold at the 20 minute mark which basically gets you boots.  Your abundance of gold is just from taking the extra camps, the bonus gold doesnt contribute that much.\n\n2.) The movespeed is fun but how often did you really need it? Sure its nice to zoom out at high-speeds but I know I'd be more than happy to trade it out for something more useful/relevant.\n\n3.) Have you tried Skirmisher's Sabre on Shyv?  I've been meaning to get around to it but just havent.\n\n4.) What's your build order?  Lately when I play Shyv now I usually go for rangers early for the sustain then swap it was stalkers right before I get devourer.

I'm fairly certain the increased gold is just from the nature of shyvana being a power farmer not from the poacher's smite.  Pretty much every game I play I feel stupidly far ahead, regardless of jungle item, just because I lived in both jungles, and remember you only get the gold when you smite their camps and assuming you only smite their camps (unlikely but lets roll with it) thats about an extra 20 gold per minute past the 4 minute mark. an extra 320 gold at the 20 minute mark which basically gets you boots.  Your abundance of gold is just from taking the extra camps, the bonus gold doesnt contribute that much.\n\nAgain, thanks to the charge system on smite, I'm able to smite both camps and clear their whole jungle within 15-30 seconds. Depending on my vision of the map and my knowledge of the enemy jungler's location and health, I may then rush straight to the other half of the jungle to take it as well. Then if I've got the timers on their buffs and can get 3 camps instead of just 2, again smiting all of them, that ends up being closer to 40-60 gold a minute than just 20, at least in the early game. Late game it is definitely a lot less than that, but if I do well in the early game that extra gold can really start a snowball going considering Shyv is fairly item dependent.\n\n> 2.) The movespeed is fun but how often did you really need it? Sure its nice to zoom out at high-speeds but I know I'd be more than happy to trade it out for something more useful/relevant.\n\nIt's not so much how often I need it so much as it is what it allows me to do. Having that huge rush of MS allows me to make riskier plays and invades, as the enemy frequently isn't expecting it. Combined with how many junglers will use smite early on in what they expect to be a safe camp, it frequently lets me walk right up to them and take their camps from them while they're fighting them and still get away too quickly for them to try and stop me, and definitely too quickly for the enemy team to come back them up.\n\nIt also has the benefit of doing (a little bit) to make up for one of counter jungling's flaws. If you really want to focus hard and commit to stealing the enemy's camps to really deprive them of gold and exp, the amount of time you have to spend travelling to the enemy jungle, due to it naturally being further away than your own, can deprive yourself of what should be some of the extra benefit of having extra camps. The move speed buff helps negate a little bit of this by getting you back to your own jungle faster afterwards.\n\nIt also helps when sneaking an extra enemy camp on your way to some other objective. Passing by on my way bot lane for a gank? Just gonna grab these wolves real quick, the MS from killing them will get me there about the same time as if I never bothered, but with an extra camp's worth of gold and xp and a devourer charge. Team's on its way to help me do dragon? I'll just grab this frog real quick and I'll still get there faster than they will. Etc.\n\nIn fact, going back to the trouble of having to travel further to reach the enemy's jungle, and how useful I really do find the MS boost, I'd say that I would gladly trade away the extra gold portion of the smite, strong but invisible and unsatisfying, in order to have the MS boost proc off of your own jungle camps as well. Turn poacher's smite into a sort of mobility smite that helps counterjungling by allowing you to outmaneuvre your opponent on the map and move through both jungles more quickly.\n\n> 3.) Have you tried Skirmisher's Sabre on Shyv?  I've been meaning to get around to it but just havent.\n\nIt's generally my go-to smite when my opponent is someone that's too difficult to counter jungle, like Udyr. It's... alright I guess? Admittedly my tests with it aren't exactly the most useful, since I generally rely on it when I've already been counter picked so I'm playing with it in a bad situation. My problem with it is that, while it certainly makes it so you can win a 1v1 with just about anybody, it doesn't really do anything to stop them from just running away from you until it wears off, which is usually what happens, at which point it's like... What're you gonna do? Keep chasing them and risk their team coming to back them up? Or just leave them be and pretty much have just wasted your smite? If anything I find it's more useful in teamfights for extra dps, where the chaos going around doesn't always even make them aware they've been smited, and the fight going on makes them less likely to want to bail on their team.\n\n> 4.) What's your build order?  Lately when I play Shyv now I usually go for rangers early for the sustain then swap it was stalkers right before I get devourer.  Usually the extra clear speed from the devastating smite is just just as useful when im invading for farm, and then later I have some cc for when I invade for kills.\n\nFull disclosure, I play Shyv a bit... oddly. For one thing, I bring exhaust instead of flash, generally relying on Burnout and Ult to escape and using exhaust for some built-in CC, which Shyv generally lacks more than good escape tools. I rush Devourer with poaching smite, making only a boots 1 purchase and some wards along the way. After that I rush Randuin's Omen so that I can engage/aoe slow in teamfights and have a good survivability item early. If I haven't done it already, I'll make sure to get Mercury Treads next, getting ninja tabi only against teams that are both AD heavy AND CC light. Then Wit's End because it's cheaper than BotRK and it synergizes well with Devourer (and just Shyv's kit in general, since people underestimate that the majority of her damage is actually magic damage), unless the opposing team is really AD heavy, in which case I'll get BotRK instead since the MR of Wit's End becomes less relevant. Somewhere along the way, if I've got some extra gold to spend, I'll upgrade my boots with Alacrity since I put a lot of priority into being able to just maneuvre around the map as quickly as possible to both prioritize jungle camps for Devourer stacks while also being able to be there for teamfights (I generally only get Homeguard if my team is doing poorly and forced heavily onto defense), and I'll upgrade my ward trinket to drop pinks, so that I can use them to check for enemy wards while doubling as vision to know where the enemy team is later. Then Sunfire Cape, and my last item generally depends on how the game is going, how I'm doing, and how the enemy team is going. If I or my team is doing well, I'll typically get BotRK for overkill and to chase people down. If things are more even or we're doing poorly, I'll get a Banshee's Veil. Thornmail if the enemy team is very auto or AD centric or just has a super fed ADC. Frozen Mallet is a thing I used to buy a long ass time ago and I keep wanting to try again, but haven't really found a situation where I've needed it. I know a lot of Shyvs build Spirit Visage, but I never do. I generally get enough MR from Wit's End, and I'm not a big fan of the item on champs with no built-in sustain to better capitalize on the passive.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"DrCyanide","date":"2015-02-09T05:32:52.107+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't know if this has come up in your discussions at all, but I think the problem with {{item:3711}} is similar to the problem with {{item:3056}} . \n\nBoth items offer cool active stuff, but are limited geographically.

Here's what I think about it currently in the jungle.\n\nCounter-jungling is VERY weak right now. With multiple changes to the jungle contributing to this. The #1 reason is that jungle monsters give bonus experience when you are a lower level then them. That means that players who were counter-jungled can easily farm their way back into the game. Couple that with trinket wards and pink wards, and you can easily spot further attempts to counter-jungle. Currently, the risk is WAY higher than the reward for counter-jungling. Getting caught and dying is very easy considering how easy it is to control vision in your own jungle. Is setting the enemy jungler behind 1 or 2 camps really worth the time and effort of counter-jungling? Not to mention the risk of dying and setting yourself behind as well?\n\nHonestly, I'm fine with this though. The opportunistic counter-jungling that we see right now is fine to me. But I don't think counter-jungling is a viable strategy to win games, NOR SHOULD IT BE. What I'd rather see is something that is more objective oriented. Some junglers don't exceed in ganking, or teamfighting, but rather in pressuring objectives. Junglers like Udyr and Master Yi are the iconic archetypes, but to degree other junglers like Shyvana, Rek'sai, and Nunu fulfill this niche as well. These junglers win games by being EVERYWHERE. They take the easy money, the easy farm, the easy objectives, and pick the easy fights. They try to split the enemy teams focus and force them into disadvantageous situations. They play the pressure game. I like this style of jungling, and I think that Poacher's Knife should instead be oriented towards this style of play.\n\nSome ideas.\n1) Surging Smite - Players can now smite themselves, giving them bonus magic damage on-hit against minions, monsters, and towers (reduced on towers) for XXX duration (say 15-30 seconds). This allows junglers to farm faster, push waves faster, and take objectives a la Feral Flare in the past.\n\n2) Hasty Smite - Players can now smite themselves, giving them a temporary burst in movespeed that decays over XXX seconds (a mini-ghost of sorts). This smite would let junglers move around the map faster, pressure the objectives that they want, and pick the fights they want.\n\n3) Cautious Smite - Upon casting smite, enemy champions within XXX radius are revealed. This would allow pressure junglers an extra precaution when pressuring objectives, or engaging in opportunistic counter-jungling. It takes some of the risk out of pushing objectives and stealing camps.","replies":[{"poster":"Sincarnation","date":"2015-02-10T04:45:42.331+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=coppinslinger,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=K9iPZAb7,comment-id=0014,timestamp=2015-02-09T21:19:37.911+0000)\n>\n\n> Honestly, I'm fine with this though.

They take the easy money, the easy farm, the easy objectives, and pick the easy fights. They try to split the enemy teams focus and force them into disadvantageous situations. They play the pressure game. I like this style of jungling, and I think that Poacher's Knife should instead be oriented towards this style of play.\n> \n> Some ideas.\n> 1) Surging Smite - Players can now smite themselves, giving them bonus magic damage on-hit against minions, monsters, and towers (reduced on towers) for XXX duration (say 15-30 seconds). This allows junglers to farm faster, push waves faster, and take objectives a la Feral Flare in the past.\n> \n> 2) Hasty Smite - Players can now smite themselves, giving them a temporary burst in movespeed that decays over XXX seconds (a mini-ghost of sorts). This smite would let junglers move around the map faster, pressure the objectives that they want, and pick the fights they want.\n> \n> 3) Cautious Smite - Upon casting smite, enemy champions within XXX radius are revealed. This would allow pressure junglers an extra precaution when pressuring objectives, or engaging in opportunistic counter-jungling. It takes some of the risk out of pushing objectives and stealing camps.\n\n\nRek'Sai wins by just having constant pressure everywhere, the way I play Nunu is having massive vision and objective control, and Shyvana wins by outfarming and pressuring the enemy jungle more than anything.  So i wouldn't say these champions pressure everything.\n\nI like the idea of maybe a unique self smite, that could be interesting depending on what neat effects it has.  Surging and Hasty are neat, someone","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Spacesuit Spiff","date":"2015-02-09T22:51:42.766+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd love if we had dedicated counterjungling champs in the game again, to kneecap the snowbally junglers. That scorching smite is actually a great idea, especially if it also grants vision so that you can get the next timer.\n\nRight now, though, if you buy a {{item:3711}} the enemy team will just drop their trinkets in the entrances to their jungle and collapse on you, and the rewards for poaching smite don't matter much when your goal is primarily to shut down the enemy jungler. 20 gold? Yeah that's helpful on Nunu.\n\nI posted a thread a while back about how you could have a \"stack\" mechanic on the jungle items to encourage interaction between the junglers. Killing enemy camps, and having both crabs up, and killing the enemy jungler, would give stacks, as a way to reward the dominant jungler with things like increased smite damage and cd, increased damage to camps and turrets, etc. The stacks would stop collecting once you get your enchantment, so that both junglers don't just randomly get max stacks during lategame.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jefftiffy","date":"2015-02-09T20:56:13.410+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"With poacher's knife it's a very good item it just is outshined by the other items and leaves you with nothing to contribute to fights like trailblazer.\nMaybe if the knife left a vision spot on the creep taken for 30s to help watch for response to the counter jungling.\n\nThe problem is though if you buff poacher's expect  people like {{champion:64}} {{champion:77}} {{champion:59}} {{champion:32}}{{champion:20}}   in your jungle 24/7.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jungle Lux God","date":"2015-02-09T20:49:46.714+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've jungled quite a bit, and wanted to share my thoughts.\n\nI feel like Ranger's Trailblazer is really good on any champs that need sustain to clear the jungle effectively, especially considering some champs that buy this item in the jungle out of necessity rather than choice. It does lack late game scaling, especially on champs that have good built-in waveclear that cannot use the AoE of Blasting Smite in the late game to clear waves faster than they normally could.\n\nStalker's Blade is also really good on any champ that doesn't need Trailblazer for sustain, or is willing to trade off some sustain for a little bit of extra ganking power, or just want the CC it gives. This upgrade basically scales well throughout the entire game, and is only useful when you don't have the health to use it.\n\nSkirmisher's Sabre is strictly better than Stalker's Blade when the champ in question has enough CC or mobility to not need the slow or movement speed boost from Stalker's Blade. I'm not sure how it is now, but before the changes to its damage you only needed 2-3 auto attacks to deal more damage than Stalker's Blade, and the damage reduction has plenty of value against a large number of targets. It even has some value in the late game because you can smite the enemy carry to reduce the damage you take from them, which is extremely useful on bruisers and tanks against the enemy ADC.\n\nPoacher's Knife suffers from both a linear design and a use for a situational playstyle. Counterjungling is an opportunistic playstyle that you cannot go into a game and say \"I want to counterjungle the enemy all game\". You have to react to where your opponent is on the map. If your opponent is in the top lane and you are by the bot lane, or your opponent is in the bottom lane and you are by the top lane, then you can try to counterjungle the half of the jungle your opponent isn't on, but if you are at your base, the jungler never shows his face, the jungler ganks mid, or you are on the same side as the enemy jungler, then you cannot risk counterjungling (or in the case of being at your base, cannot counterjungle at all), or the reward for a countergank would be a lot greater than a successful counterjungle. This also doesn't include the fact that counterjungling has less value in the later stages of the game because at that point, you either cannot risk taking the enemy jungle because you have no map control or you there is no point counterjungling because there is not a lot to counterjungle when your whole team has the enemy team's jungle to take for free. Poacher's Knife needs better rewards, because its designated playstyle is too situational and risky to have an entire playstyle based around.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LordKentravyon","date":"2015-02-09T20:48:30.589+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the ability to change your smite when you have the tier 1 upgrade is \n\nI frequently start purple smite on some champs for sustain (like naut) but then when im ready to upgrade to the full jgl item I switch it out to blue smite for late game.\n\nI've taken poachers in some matches where I know I have a huge jgl advantage.

This could give it more appeal because you are at less risk of having your smite upgrade become useless, since you get at least *some* bonus for using it in your own jungle.","replies":[]},{"poster":"aperson1","date":"2015-02-09T09:15:09.074+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How about a ground-targeted \"mini-CV\" effect on Smite, like on current Scrying Orb?

The only time I really see it happening is when the camp just comes up and the jungler just died/ganked/recalled etc. If that's the case you're better off taking a smite that actually has purpose outside the jungle / greater purpose in your jungle because you can clear it safely without even using smite.

Sure you don't get the reset, but you're still denying the enemy their camp and then can go back and take your own. \n\nPoacher's is a unique concept, but given the fact that the top tier junglers are also very strong duelists while the counter junglers are not... It means they lose every time. It's far too easy to be PUNISHED for counter jungling than it is to make any significant gains from it. Better to just stay in your own jungle and take camps from time to time when its a good opportunity which does not require Poacher's Smite at all.  Which again, when you can use that smite to slow an enemy or something that's much more effective for the course of the game--even if you do have to wait a little bit to use it during a gank. You don't need it during a gank, so you're not at a huge disadvantage when it's down. It just makes your ganks that much stronger. Where as Poacher's has no purpose outside of the enemy jungle, an area that is hard to stick around in without good vision and so unless you're buying a sight stone which is going to wreck your clearing capabilities you'll get destroyed in the enemy jungler when their lanes collapse in.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PoE00dpWDk","date":"2015-02-09T05:36:41.512+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This would be more or a mid to late game buff to poachers, but what if Poachers smite was significantly more powerful than normal smite by like 20% or so if I am smiting the enemy's jungle monsters or dragon/baron.
