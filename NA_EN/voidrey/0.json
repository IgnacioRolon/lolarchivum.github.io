This is an isolated war between two factions that shouldn't include the intervention of others (even if Ionia would appreciate the help).

The anime has characters who personifies each individual country.)\n\nAnd the thing is, this is also politics.  Demacia can't interfere in every single thing Noxus does or every single thing bad going on around them.\n\nFor Demacia to be willing to randomly jump in and say \"Eff you\" to Noxus with their invasion of Ionia, Demacia needs to be able to get something out of it.  And what they get needs to be more than just \"Ha. Nice try Evil.\"  Demacia getting involved means that they're either trying to achieve 1 of 3 things\n\n1.) Cripple Noxus (which is the most obvious, but that only gets them so much if nothing else comes of it)\n\n2.) Acquire Land and Resources  (they are trying to stop Noxus from taking Ionian land and resources, so Demacia may have rights to Ionian land and resources.\n\n3.) Self honor.  (now, while this may seem like the point you tried to make earlier, Demacia has no dealings with Ionia nor cause to fight for them.  Especially if Demacia is trying to care chiefly for themselves and build upon their own power and might.  But if, say, Zaun, who is a close ally of Noxus during the invasion did something to Demacia in the meanwhile, not ONLY will Demacia protect Ionia from Noxus, but they will also make sure that Zaun burns.)\n\n\nWhen it comes to government dealings and politics, jumping headlong into every single fight a non-ally commits to or jumping at the chance to protect every single country that has no need of your protection (or rather would cause you to lose resources and commit to something that should be left alone) does not bode well for the future.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"RottedApples","date":"2016-04-29T04:49:54.039+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"america was already supplying some tanks and resources to other countries though before they entered the war themselves.\n\nDo we know if demacia is doing this?","replies":[{"poster":"Devack The Holy","date":"2016-04-29T22:20:54.349+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can just see them doing this:\n\n{{champion:43}} : Hey, we're getting invaded by Noxus.
