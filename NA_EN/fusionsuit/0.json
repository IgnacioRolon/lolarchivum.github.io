Seems like she prefers to \"test\" different people and teach them some kind of lesson. Since she talks about Gangplank and his fall from his seat of power, it feels like she tries to reach the inner potential of different people during her \"teachings\". She also states that Miss Fortune Betrayal waked Gangplank from his slumber (due to his power he wasn't living anymore his life to fullest i suppose). Only thing that bothers me is that her voiceover seems to suggest she's being traveling (or has traveled) through Runeterra, so it could be possible she isn't oblivious to other cultures like the Freljordians, but that is only my opinion for the moment.","replies":[]}]}]}
