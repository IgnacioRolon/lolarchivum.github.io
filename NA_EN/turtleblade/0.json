Why is it a joke and how can I get better matchmaking? It seems like the other team always has the better matchmade team.\r\n\r\nJust played several games. Each one has either an AFK, feeder, troll pick, or a rambo feeder.\r\n\r\nYes, I know the whole bs of &quot;if you are good enough you should carry blablabla&quot;. But you can&#039;t carry when at 6 minutes the enemy team is up 10 kills because the laners decide to go ham. I know I&#039;m not the best or one of the best or whatever, I know I make mistakes and have a lot to work on. But, the people I get paired with are just complete numbskulls. I don&#039;t want to be on a super strong team that carries me, but I&#039;m sick of being on teams that drag me down.\r\n\r\nI am buying pink wards, I am ganking, out-csing and even then I can&#039;t keep up because someone is feeding so hard and just snowballs the other team. What can I do then?\r\n\r\nShould I just focus on stat-padding and hopefully that gives me a better team or something? Anyone have any ideas or tricks to get more competent players? Other than elo boosting? I want to climb legit.","replies":[{"poster":"ShadÃ²w","date":"2016-08-14T23:37:55.463+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dynamic Queue is a joke itself already","replies":[]},{"poster":"Serpents Embrace","date":"2016-08-14T23:43:37.676+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're not placed yet, so I'd say finish placements before you try to reconsider your strategy.\n\nHowever, you do seem to be jungling more often than not? My best advice for that would be to focus on bot lane and focus on objectives. The new changes to how towers work (the first tower bonus gold, the lack of shielding on bot turret etc) make it a better place to gank than top or mid. Maybe as Lee, start in your bot lane, gank top and level 3 to try to snowball your top laner and then hit bot often and hard. The enemy jungler may go top to try to undo the damage you did earlier and that will allow you to take dragons or bot turret. Once you do that, you can play it by ear and try to show up where you're needed.","replies":[{"poster":"Turtleblade","date":"2016-08-16T03:00:26.173+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for the tips, I appreciate your comments :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Aeziir","date":"2016-08-15T15:53:43.186+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The problem is that you took this game seriously.
