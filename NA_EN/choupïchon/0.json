The tentacle blocking champs more specifically will only occur depending on where the tentacle spawns. You can get out of it,  but you need to walk in a certain direction. I'm going to follow up with the Champion team and let 'em know.","replies":[{"poster":"AnataBakka","date":"2018-03-20T08:13:19.821+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Same thing happens when the tentacle spawns in the area between the base and the jungle. I happen to get stuck there once in a while since the tentacle can spawn right in the middle.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ifneth","date":"2018-03-17T06:03:07.249+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Woah.
