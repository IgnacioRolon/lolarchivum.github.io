Faker makes mistakes. Sometimes.\n>\nI don't feel that justifies giving someone a lot of shit. If they are truly being careless or taking dumb risks, I would point that out in the interest of helping them to get better, but err on the side of being conservative here. In my experience, players tend to think innocent mistakes are not innocent, or think that accidents could have trivially been prevented. I think we all expect more forgiveness as players than we are willing to give out to others.\n>\nThere is no excuse to harass anyone in League, period. Nothing someone can do in a game can justify you trying to use verbal (or spoken if they can hear you) language so harsh. There is a reason nearly every sport in the world adopts some kind of sportsmanship mentality.\n>\nThe advice I frequently give players is to pretend that other player is a student in your class or a coworker at school. When you're face to face, you're unlikely to unload on someone who you are going to frequently see or work with again. Why should it be any different online? If your answer is because you'll never have to see them again, then you're kind of arguing that you're only ever respectful to people for pretty selfish reasons rather than because it's the human thing to do.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Very Hard Engage","date":"2016-09-27T23:35:14.005+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"you mean : \"I recognize were going to lose, but im not doing what you want because im having too much fun doing what i want to do, screw winning I AM DOING THIS, even if it means dieing/losing\"\n\nwe're never \"harassing\" you when you make a mistake, we are outright telling you what you just did is wrong. and heres the correction theres no nice or coddling way to tell you that. you need to grow up and deal with it.","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-09-28T00:01:19.394+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Who is \"we\"?
