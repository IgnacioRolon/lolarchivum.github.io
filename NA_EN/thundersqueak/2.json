XD\npart of the REASON why here rework was so GOOD was it GAVE her the countplay she didn't ever have before the rework, it but her strengths into balance, and it buffed her weak areas.\n\nshe would no longer \"throw spears all day\" instead you had to \"pounce in\" not just or a kill. but to TRADE.\n\nher TRADE required you to pounce in, you would never win lane by just throwing spears after her rework.\nnot only did this rework FORCE her to go into melee range as a squishy AP champ, the nerfs to her  auto attack make it near impossible to farm without using cougar form abilities. AGAIN forcing her to go in melee range.\n\nnot only was this easier to counterplay her, it made her IMMENSELY more fun to play.\n\nin support she also had traps that did % HP. and BECUASE traps used to give 1200 vison on placement, and they USED to do 10% hp\neven with no form of CC and only a heal/ As steroid  for the ADC and some trap vision she could support. while kind of actile like a blitz or a thresh in the way of zoning the opponent to try not to stay in front of the minion line.\n\n\nanyways.\nsince you DON'T play nidalee and don't like her very much, but you still seem to be the only person ever responding.. im still going to ask this..\n\nin patch 5.5\nhttp://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-55-notes#patch-nidalee\nit CLEARLY stated that the removal of % HP was to LOWER her clear speed\nAND that \"**we're re-balancing the damage so that while still useful with ability power,** doesn't trivialize fighting the toughest monsters out there.\"\n\nfirst off her %hp already had a cap of 200 damage vs monster that was added from her rework\nif you wanted to LOWER the damage vs monster LOWER THE CAP, i mean use can use the EXACT SAME VALUES you currently have for the cap... 40/80/120/160/200\n\n2nd\nspeaking of which those values 40/80/120/160/200 + .2 AP\n\nare HORRID\nnidalee levels her traps LAST\n\neven BEFORE her rework when traps DID do flat damage they had 80 / 125 / 170 / 215 / 260 (+40% AP). \nPLUS a aoe proc PLUS 20% armormagic pen gaining 5% more pen per level, and they lasted TWICE as long\n\neven without the AOE, with HALF the duration, and wihout the armor and MR shred. \n\nher current values 40/80/120/160/200 (+20% AP)\nare still HALF her pre-rework values  of 80 / 125 / 170 / 215 / 260 (+40% AP). \nespecially when u consider nid doesn't get a 2nd point traps into lvl 13\n\nwhat was GREAT about her reworked traps was the % hp gave her  a SLIGHT bit of counterplay (however EXTREMELY unreliable) to the MAIN coutner nid has.... tanks. granted they would have to chase you into a trapped bush.. or WALK on multiple visible traps for you to even stand a remote chance of you try to do anything but run for your life.\n\nbut it at least made it so the enemy would TRY to avoid them.\n\nNOBODY cares about steppign on a trap that does 40/80/120/160/200 + .2 AP. and NOTHING ELSE\n\nunless the enemy is at LOW HP, all alone and currently within pounce range. (which NEVER happens) you CANT pounce in on them\n\nso the whole\n \"we're re-balancing the damage so that while **still useful with ability power,** doesn't trivialize fighting the toughest monsters out there.\"\n\n\"still useful with ability power\" is complete bullshit. they are WORTHLESS. even less so since you drastically the passive range on hunted when they step on one which was the ONLY thing they did.\n\nafter the pounce reset nerf you cant even use traps to pounce multiple times for a clear.\n\nthey literally do NOTHING USEFUL.\n\nand all because the %HP was removed for NO REASON because all you had to do was lower the cap to accomplish the EXACT SAME THING.\n\nalso, give Riot Repetoir  my love from a nidalee main. the current balanced team might have destroyed his rework. \nbut it was still the best one ever done!!!\n\nPS. if you could pass down this post to a member of they balance team, i would love for them to see it..","replies":[{"poster":"Aesah","date":"2016-07-26T01:43:40.909+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":2,"body":"Hi my favorite champion is Nidalee, have hundreds of games played on her.

TARGETING them with the ability.\n\nand 90% of the time when i pounce in an use takedown they get hit by it, because there is nothing else takedown can hit.\n\nyet.. if the enemy happens to be near another targetable unit. such as a minion or a tower. takedown will SOMETIMES attack the minion or tower instead of them. even though the hunted target is in range and i JUST targeted the hunted target with a pounce.\n\nso i ask.. WHY is the game randomly changing targets? i JUST clicked on them with LITERALLY my LAST click. \ni think a simple solution would be for takdown to \"prioritize\"  hunted targets in range.\n\nyes you can technically CLICK the champion AGAIN after you pounce. but since it only happens when there are IN a minion wave the possibility of a mis-click is high and i see no reason why it should have even contemplated other targets in the first place.\n\nit doesn't happen very often.. but with over 1000 nidalee games played.. i have lost well over 20 games because i didn't get a kill and we lost a teamfight and the game because of this.. and even  when it hasn't cost me the game.. it has usually cost me one of my 9 lives.","replies":[{"poster":"Aesah","date":"2016-07-26T09:06:46.187+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"I actually was strongly against the removal of the auto attack reset on Nidalee but your post is a great example of why it's actually a good idea, because of this:\n\n> oh god... of course she needs the nerf at higher elos... i dont think ANYONE would argue with THAT. but she needs to be COMPENSATE for the way it affects her LOWER elos play.\n> \n> 99.9997 of players are NOT lcs\n> http://www.leagueofgraphs.com/rankings/rank-distribution\n\nThat is a huge nerf at higher ELOs, but most (not all) lower ELO Nidalee players don't really take advantage of it anyway, so with this change we're literally doing exactly what you were advocating in your post- making her easier to balance across all skill ranges.","replies":[{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2016-07-26T12:11:41.319+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"He doesn't mention the R aa-resets in his complaints, though.

If she had normal clear speed, she'd be the definition of a guaranteed kill at 6. Her ult range can be used from the bush and if you're even semi competent enough to lane your CC, you'll always get a kill the moment you hit 6, doesn't matter where it is, what lane or who the match up is or even if they are full health when you gank. Someone WILL die. Other champion's 6, not so much. \n\nThe counterpoint some people argue is that Nautilus is similar to Leona in terms of CC, but their ults vary greatly, one is immediate, the other is delayed. People at least have time to react to Nautilus coming out of the bush, you have little to no time to react with Leona. \n\nI'm all for people experimenting, but there are points where Riot indeed needs to step in and say, absolutely not, certain champions, Alistar and Leona are one of them in which they need to be crippled if they are taken into the jungle. If they had normal jungle clears, they'd be god tier junglers because of how much CC and ease they bring in a gank, guaranteed.

Realistically, no champ should be viable for every role. If they're used for more than 2, they're generally overturned. Each lane provides something slightly different, so if they're good at multiple lanes the champ is bringing too much to the table. \n\nLets take Alistar as an example. If he was to jungle again, he'd more than likely crowd out others and have nigh unavoidable ganks. He'd have to be nerfed. This would then make him worse at supporting. The aim was not to force him out of support, it was to make him balanced.

Problem is, you can't nerf that without making him UP in support position. And Support remains his main role, so that's out of the question.\n\nAnother possibility would be to embrace the Jungler build and to balance him around that, and supports be damned if he's UP as a result, but that would be kinda strange, and I don't think that's what you're asking for either.\n\nOverall, a lot of Supports create big game health issues if they are allowed to be played outside of Support. They have such powerful utility that if they have the ability to clear the jungle efficiently enough, they can just provide that utility to all the lanes, and it's game-breaking.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"RogueWill","date":"2016-07-26T04:28:12.763+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=InsanitysTheName,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=qEczG6Yc,comment-id=00010001000000020000,timestamp=2016-07-26T02:47:59.996+0000)\n>\n> The problem is not if Leona or Alistar are played in the jungle. The problem arises when champs that are designed to be good at one thing end up being too good at something else (See tank Ekko, Fizz). Cases where design ends about the same but positive gameplay occurs Riot usually leaves alone. An example of this is Vi being designed as a top lane bruiser but being played primarily jungle. Her gameplay is similar in both cases and she does not cause any game health issues in the jungle role.\n\nehhh...not completely true. see Diana, she was designed to be a jungler and nothing else, go see her champion spotlight and you will see that unlike Vi she is not even mentioned as a laner. People saw she had more potential as a tanky assasin and eventually she was balanced around that without the need of a completely rework (eventhough she was not intended as a laner). Similarly Lulu designed as support but is currently balanced aroudn her being a solo laner (support lulu is rather on the weak side). Similarly Nautilius designed as a Jungler but is currently balanced more around a support role....and fairly a buch of other champions","replies":[{"poster":"InsanitysTheName","date":"2016-07-26T17:43:24.052+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with this but i would argue that unlike bringing Ekko or Leona into the jungle, solo lane Lulu and support Nautilus have highly similar playstyles to their intended role.
