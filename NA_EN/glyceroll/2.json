Do you have any favorites or games we missed? Let us know in the comments! \n\n\n\n**Donger Dash!**\n\n\nDonger Dash is a death-defying race around Summoner&rsquo;s Rift or Twisted Treeline made by Phantoml0rd. Two teams set out to do as many laps as possible without dying to turrets, fountains, or enemy champions. For more in depth rules, check out [this handy image](http://imgur.com/QYKEsOO) by ArteFactos. \n\n\n\n**Protect the Soraka**\n\n\nSimilar to &ldquo;Protect the President&rdquo; played in /All Chat, except that Soraka Bot is the &ldquo;president&rdquo; and you must protect her! Soraka Bot knows what&rsquo;s &ldquo;best&rdquo; for her team, and will charge heedlessly into five enemies, so you must defend her with your life...or kill her if she&rsquo;s on the opposing team. \n\n\n**Hide and Seek**\n\n\nHide and Seek is a 5v2 game mode in which the hiders try their best to avoid both the seeker roaming around the map. The hiding champions only have 5 chances to not get caught, or else they are out of the game. For a detailed post about all the intricacies of Hide and Seek, check out [this post by Faerlina Sin](http://www.mobafire.com/league-of-legends/build/custom-league-of-legends-hide-and-seek-345522). \n\n**BRAWL!**\n\nBrawl is essentially a team death match mode. The goal is to reduce the enemy&#039;s total points down to 250 without recalling, capturing points, or leaving the inner circle of the map. Check out [this post by Hitsux3](http://forums.euw.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=1309773) for more information. \n\n\n**Ultimate Bravery**\n\nUltimate Bravery is the most well known of the community created games; it&rsquo;s essentially a &ldquo;chaos&rdquo; version of Summoner&rsquo;s Rift. Players are automatically assigned a champion, summoner spells, masteries, and a full item build and have to somehow manage to win the game. Check out their website [here](http://www.ultimate-bravery.com/), or join the chat &ldquo;Ultimate Bravery&rdquo; in game.\n\n\n**Support Wars**\n\nSupport Wars is very similar to Protect the Soraka but instead the president is an AD Carry bot for both teams. Bottom lane has to be the same on both teams, but that&rsquo;s the only restriction. The goal for each team is to either kill the enemy AD Carry or take the bottom lane turret. Shoutout to [StirFriedTeemo for this game mode](http://forums.euw.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=1721683)! \n\n\n**Baron Pit Dodgeball**\n\n\n[Dodgeball](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lc6iIZWC3cQ) pits both teams against each other in a suspenseful game of baiting and juking. If you get hit with an ability, you&rsquo;re out. There&rsquo;s a fairly complex set of rules, involving champion selection and limits to the abilities you can grab, so [check out D0ubD3aD&rsquo;s post for the full list](http://forums.euw.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=1421575). \n\n\n**Find the Teemo**\n\n\nSimilar to Hide and Seek, [Find the Teemo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SrrbJ1NtjI) pits both teams against each other to find and kill Teemo!  Check out [this post by JonOhTin](http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=1148913) for all the rules and variations of the game.\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"PiRoScOuT","date":"2015-07-17T19:16:53.663+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":4,"body":"what is your favorite?","replies":[{"poster":"Arie","date":"2015-07-17T19:28:59.077+0000","up_votes":142,"down_votes":4,"body":"Find the Teemo because he deserves every death he gets. :D","replies":[{"poster":"KingTutzs","date":"2015-07-17T20:17:27.383+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":3,"body":"was thinking the same thing","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Glyceroll","date":"2015-07-17T19:23:58.992+0000","up_votes":62,"down_votes":4,"body":"Protect the Soraka!

We have lists of champions that each faction can play, and we play games where each team only plays the champions from that faction. It's pretty detailed and fun, more of a roleplaying game than anything else. I'm in Noxus right now. DEATH TO ALL SHURIMANS!

Regardless of how many players on each team, there has to be at least 1 {{champion:412}}, called The Fisherman. \n- The team playing Fish would go inside the Baron pit and stay in there. They can move around **IN **the pit but not outside it, except for certain conditions. They are also allowed to ward around the pit from inside _(that means no going out to ward, only ward out from inside) and attack Thresh if they see him (but be careful, attacking means risking being hooked)_.\n- Allies of the Fisherman {{champion:412}} are banned from entering the pit and attacking the Fish in there, but they can try to reveal the pit with their skills, {{item:2044}} , {{item:3342}} or {{summoner:2}}. However, during revealing time, {{champion:412}} is not allowed to hook anyone.\n- The Allies can also clear {{item:2044}} and {{item:2043}} placed around the pit, and kill any enemies they spotted.\n- A {{item:2043}}  is to be placed in the enemy base at the beginning of the game by {{champion:412}}. No one can destroy it.\n\n- {{champion:412}} can go around the pit but not inside it and he can only hook from outside the pit when fog of war covers it.\n- Whoever got hooked is out, and become Ghost Fish, who goes ward around the pit.\n    - If Thresh has allies and the Ghost is killed by the Allies, he can return to Baron pit area to continue supporting his fishy comrades.  \n    - If Thresh has fewer than 2 allies, the Ghost is only allowed to place {{item:2043}}. If {{champion:412}} is able to land a hit on him, he is forced to return to base and report to the {{item:2043}} Thresh set up. From that point onward, he cannot leave and he is only allowed to use the {{summoner:2}} and {{item:3342}} (if he has) to support the other Fish.\n\n- When Baron spawns, the game ends. You can choose to continue it, but if Baron kills all the fish, the game also ends.
