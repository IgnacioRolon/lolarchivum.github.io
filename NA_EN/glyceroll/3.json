The [Trinity Force Network](http://trinityforcepodcast.com) is a group of podcasts that cover everything from training and tips, eSports, patch rundowns, developer interviews, to a special podcast devoted primarily to Oceanic news.  \r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY-DIR-K2J8\r\n\r\n\r\n[Adam Cogswell](https://twitter.com/TFPwn), founder of the Network, has been working for years to perfect the science of podcasting. The Trinity Force Network community has grown by leaps and bounds over the past few months and continues to grow at an exponential rate. Read on to learn more about Adam and his growing network of podcasts! \r\n\r\n\r\n**Why did you decide to start the Trinity Force Podcast?**\r\n\r\nPhew, that&rsquo;s a story. So it was near the end of Season 1 when I had been playing more League than any other video game. My friends Auslander and Ranhert were chatting about starting a League of Legends radio show complete with whistles, funny noises, and any other sound they could pipe in via Skype. They were both apprehensive about letting me take over because the radio show idea was generally a joke. However, the next thing we know we were all on Skype recording our first episode of the Trinity Force Podcast.\r\n\r\n**What&rsquo;s your favorite topic during the podcast?**\r\n\r\nI LOVE talking about patch notes on the Proper show. It makes me a better player when I can look at a change, dissect it, and explain why and what is going to happen with the champion and meta. Humorously, we can take what is seemingly the smallest change and turn it into a 10 or 15 minute conversation. Like the latest Lulu change:  It wasn&rsquo;t that big on paper but we all agreed that the power shift favored lane Lulu just as much as it did support Lulu.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmSbggZK-pw\r\n\r\n**How each of the current podcast teams come together?**\r\n\r\nThe Proper podcast started as 3 guys who were just doing it to have fun. After a couple of years, and meeting a lot of like-minded people through the hobby, we finally ended up with the five people who are currently on the show. We also have an AWESOME producer that goes by the name of Lancifur. We wouldn&rsquo;t be able to produce the Proper show if he didn&rsquo;t put in the time to make sure it&rsquo;s put together, and out on the website, on time each week! \r\n\r\nThe LCS Rundown is the brain child of my friend Domenic. The LCS started to grow and we were brainstorming ways we could incorporate both the LCS and general game theory into one podcast. That&rsquo;s when the idea for a new podcast was formed. \r\n\r\nNext are the [OzLoL](https://twitter.com/OzLoLPodcast) guys: They&rsquo;re the longest running Australian podcast that talks about the OPL and patch notes. We love the show they put together because it&rsquo;s a unique concept: Focus on a single region and become the go-to for all information about those teams. \r\n\r\nFinally, the Four Wards podcast is the most recent addition to the Network. A bunch of us realized that we had new listeners who couldn&rsquo;t keep up with some of Proper&rsquo;s discussion. So we put our heads together and decided to create a podcast to help new players move forward (four ward, get it?) in League of Legends. \r\n\r\nEach of the podcasts serves a purpose in the Network and they make up over 5 hours of content a week. We&rsquo;re trying to design the podcasts so that you can grow with the Network both as a player and a community member.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Any tips for players looking to start a podcast or to start shout casting?**\r\n\r\nDo it because you love it.\r\n\r\n I see a lot of people make the mistake of trying to create content because they want money or fame. When it comes to content creation, you should do it because you love to do it. You should be willing to put your content out regardless if you have 100 or 100,000 views! If you show the people who digest your content that you&rsquo;re doing it because you love to do it, they&rsquo;ll love to support you.\r\n\r\nAlso, make sure that you find people who are going to support you no matter what. When someone asks me what I do for a living I put a big smile on my face:  I&rsquo;m a podcaster! Yes, I talk about a video game via the Internet! This astounds most people but it goes back to the original point: If you show that you love what you do, and you&rsquo;re not afraid to talk about it, it&rsquo;ll show in your final product.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBe sure to check out the Trinity Force Podcast and the rest of their shows on both [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/trinity-force-podcast-league/id485769640) and their [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/TForcePodcast) channel! \r\n\r\nWant to give your favorite community/content creator a spotlight?

I'll be the first to admit: We are not always right and sometimes our opinions are biased based on our own play. The Kha'zix R / Q debate sparked a HUGE conversation inter-network.

My experience with Kha is limited so I won't pretend to be a professional at him by any standards but I feel like out of the jungle in most cases you'll wanna go evolved E > Q > W (E first for the extended range, resets for tower diving if you know you'll get the kill and of course the late game, Q to counter jungle and for clear speed, although those first two I feel can be switched depending on what kind of aggression you intend to go for and W for the late game slow and to tag more targets) Many players are very sad with the current state of the evolved ult, it sounds amazing on paper but in practice it just doesn't compare to what the others give. It's strange, stealth defines certain champs such as Rengar or Talon but Khas identity falls into his leaps and outplays with isolation. Again, my opinion is just that of a novice Kha player so take it with a grain of salt, it's just my views.\n\nBack to fueling your egos, your podcast is phenomenal and I tune in pretty much the same day that they're uploaded to the site, would donate if I could (Wife, 3 kids and a mortgage, lifes a bitch) but if any of you would like to add me to play a game or two, I would be more than down!\n\nAlso strange question, what's your favorite kind of beer?","replies":[{"poster":"pwnophobia","date":"2015-07-01T14:36:05.058+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Taredom,realm=NA,application-id=2XjzURgc,discussion-id=5whoRBEy,comment-id=001b00000000,timestamp=2015-07-01T14:25:53.073+0000)\n>\n> Not gonna lie, simply receiving responses from you and Chira absolutely made my day!

Unless you're skirmishing a ton the evolved Claws will allow you to secure kills and W will allow you to farm faster for 11. I agree with the ultimate point, I'm not a big fan of it now they reduced the damage taken when you pop it. Kha just doesn't have the impact that Talon and Rengar have in the game because he's not as dominate once he hits level 6.

I'd say that the majority of the league community especially lower elos have poor communication in game and haven't learned how to team fight. So if you are bronze-low gold, you probably do run into more people who haven't developed those skills in a league of legends setting. That being said, as part of the Tforce community you can join in on the in game chat channel Tforce and find people to play with that will not only help you get better, but will better communicate with you while in game.

(I have played casually since S1, and I'm unranked) I took a break recently when Witcher 3 released, now every time I try to play a game (less than 1/day on avg now) I get matched up with some of the _worst_ people in this community. \n\nSo I'm done. There's no point wasting 30-60 minutes/game. I have never found a more hostile, awful community - nobody whatsoever wants to work together, there is no sense of Team, and it is always someone else's fault for their loss. (Hypocritical, right? - except its usually that asshole in Top or Mid who feeds, their lane snowballs, then it is suddenly the team's fault for not roaming to help their lane when the rest of the team was busy doing their job) \n\nNot to mention 500ms ping spikes every game lately (usually it was 1 in 20 games, now its more like 2 in 3 games). \n\nThis game has so much potential, but this community eats away at that every single second. I used to have a blast, even playing solo, when no friends are online... Now I can't even have fun with a 4 man premade because that 5th person is probably going to be so bad they manage to drag the rest of the team down. Go figure. One person can't carry and win the game every time, but that same one person can absolutely lose the game for the team _every_ time.\n\nCould I be the common denominator? Sure, it is definitely a possibility and my match history would suggest this, however my gameplay is for the most part very consistent regardless of a win or loss as support, and in each of my most recent games lately I've had some of the fewest deaths on the team.\n\nNot even remotely worth the time or effort to try to work through the ranked hell system in hopes of being matched up with better players... I wish this game were not so hostile, its like every time I launch it I get slapped in the face. Part of me wishes it would die off already so everyone would move onto something better. It would be LOVELY if there were an option to select a queue that is _NOT_ filled with bronze through gold people, they can duke it out together. I'd much rather play with plat/diamond and professional players than the chum I get queued with most days - and playing against such opponents should actually result in people improving and learning. Playing against and with trash just results in frustration.\n\nBut everyone seems to be content with this festering cesspool of a community, so nothing will really change.\n\n/rant","replies":[{"poster":"Asderition","date":"2015-07-01T20:03:58.112+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You should try hanging out with us, over in the Tforce in-client chat room. \n\nTo be honest, EVERY video games has that toxicity you are referring to. But with such a massive player base, and so many more players to choose from, we tend to focus on the negative all the time. Look at call of Duty, a decent amount of those players aren't even kids trying to do our moms, but we base the entire franchise off that one bias. I have plenty of great friends that play CoD, some being the nicest folks I know.  I suggest listening to the second video posted by Glyc, Riot Lyte and Ghostcrawler were interviewed by the TForce Proper and they delved into some of the topics you mentioned. It's at least worth a listen, right?\n\nI think your outlook is a little too harsh. At TForce, we try to be an inspiring community, bringing players together to achieve a common goal, to get better at League of Legends. Of course, we aren't the entire player base, but neither are the toxic players. \n\nRemember, if you want something to change, be the spark that starts it. \n\nI have been playing this game a long time, 5 years, actually. I love it. I wouldn't trade my time with League for anything. It's all a matter of perspective, friend. I hope you reconsider, take care!","replies":[{"poster":"Pharoah Ramses","date":"2015-07-01T22:37:46.915+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Appreciate the reply. I'll give it a listen. \n\nHonestly, I don't want to quit the game - but I've been burnt out on the player interactions. My competitive side wants to improve, keep progressing learning the supports inside & out but I must say I'm finding it harder and harder to keep at it. Been on tilt for weeks, at least looking at my current losing streak. The more hate and resentment I direct towards this game though, the more I realize I've loved playing it, I'm just frustrated.\n\nI also understand that the toxic people are not the entire community here - I'm just pointing to the fact that in my experience, at my ELO/MMR (Unless there is no metric for normal queue), the vast majority of people are not fun to play with - they make it a chore... Of course you do run across the rare nice person who is actually willing to try and bring everyone together -  but I'm sick of trying to be that person, its tiring, I just try to be quiet and follow the team, be a bodyguard (Support main). I think without a full premade team OR VoIP (with everyone utilizing it) there is little hope for actually working as a team. I'm guilty of ignoring pings when I'm in the middle of a fight - I'm sure a lot of people are... But when my friends in Teamspeak ping AND call out what is being pinged I know exactly what's going on... The ping system doesn't work ~~well~~(for everyone). \n\n\nIn a different direction;\nI think @Riot could take a fairly simple approach which would rapidly impact the community and player experience... Just add a VoIP service for each team. I imagine it would still be a large development project, even just incorporating existing VoIP software into their engine, but it would be a huge change in how we interact in-game. Currently, there is no voice, therefore there is no \"human\" element which breaks down barriers making it easier for people to be an asshole without feeling much remorse(Hiding behind your keyboard). You add voice to the equation it is simple; emotion is now introduced and the experience becomes a little bit closer to an actual human interaction - which naturally discourages being a complete douchebag (There are of course always social exceptions). I believe the Tribunal system would still stand and work well for people abusing VoIP - and a simple mute button exists in _EVERY_ feature so when someone steps out of line they're muted. If they're acting like that it is likely that they are not being a positive contribution to the fight in the game. Riot could easily program the system to redflag for potential VoIP abuse if a player gets muted in a game, just incorporate a simple event and mutecount. If there's a mute & a report after the game boom instant escalation to tribunal or some other level of organization. \n\nNot to mention asking/telling someone to calm down and listen to a game plan really quickly over VoIP is **FAR** easier than typing out a wall of text mid fight. I'm quite shocked it'd been almost 6 years and still no VoIP.","replies":[{"poster":"Tsylent","date":"2015-07-03T01:15:00.564+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Join the TForce chat room in the client.
