To many people are unaware of this and i get a custom mod you join lobbys to play can't exactly make this apparent but Underlords and TFT really shoulda have spotlighted this information considering the number of people calling the game \"RNG\" (i mean TFT is heavilly rng based but in the item department, not champions)","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"mack9112","date":"2019-06-28T17:28:53.146+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"It’s like draft from mtg","replies":[{"poster":"Dynikus","date":"2019-06-28T17:32:23.850+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=mack9112,realm=NA,application-id=RaE1aOE7,discussion-id=K6AG9vcF,comment-id=0008,timestamp=2019-06-28T17:28:53.146+0000)\n>\n> It’s like draft from mtg\n\nnot really.
