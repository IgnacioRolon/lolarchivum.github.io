We couldn&#039;t finish because there was no tower we could hit nor the nexus and then they respawned and aced us cause we were super low.

I;m gonna upload it to youtube and link it soon.\nBasically we took the right turret but apparently didn't finish the left one. we were both desynched at the perfect time to save them...

You cannot even click on them and you instantly lose your target.\nI think you just got confused in the heat of the moment.\nWeird that this is the first time that happened to you, I mean it's not like you're new to the game or anything.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"BestPudgeNA","date":"2018-12-10T05:36:34.657+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=goodiesohhi,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=W6oqLJjl,comment-id=,timestamp=2018-12-10T02:36:11.631+0000)\n>\n> So we went back to check on inhib as they were spawning but it was still down. \n\nThe inhib respawned","replies":[{"poster":"goodiesohhi","date":"2018-12-10T11:49:36.431+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=BestPudgeNA,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=W6oqLJjl,comment-id=0006,timestamp=2018-12-10T05:36:34.657+0000)\n>\n> The inhib respawned\n\nI am well aware.

It's just very convenient and very tilting. Like Jax and I seriously thought we were going insane or something. Like I thought I switched world lines. Like in Steins;Gate. Imagine killing a tower, being unable to kill nexus, a second later, realizing tower is still shooting dying. Then seeing the tower still there.
