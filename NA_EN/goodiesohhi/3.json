I would be too. Enemy's just free farming bot.\nThe below is just a sum of what was happening (not quotes)\nBotlane in all chat: I don't think your 3 jg strats working aatrox.\nAatrox: profanities\nMundo: Pls report bot\nMe: Pls Report\nBotlane: I don;t think your 3 jg strats working aatrox.\nTahm: Whadya mean I'm trolling? You clicked to exit there I didn't spit you hurdur.\nBotlane: More lies about how aatrox asked them to support him jg.\nAatrox: more profanities.\nMe: Trying to explain to enemy all chat that our bot is just making s*** up.\nMundo: Pls report","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Hyquiem","date":"2018-07-01T02:51:57.074+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"What’s an R word.. the slangs in a country is like every city’s time zone on one clock.","replies":[{"poster":"goodiesohhi","date":"2018-07-01T02:54:41.331+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=PERIMITION,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=ysmuvgE8,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2018-07-01T02:51:57.074+0000)\n>\n> What’s an R word.. the slangs in a country is like every city’s time zone on one clock.\n\n\"Retard/retarded\"\nIt was directed at a shyvana who helped herself to my wave everytime she walked from topside jg to botside jg.\nAsked her to stop 3 times and she ignored me so I blew my lid the fourth time and flamed her.

But I controled myself and I think it’s safe to say that player might have learned the wrath of purposefully ruining the game.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
