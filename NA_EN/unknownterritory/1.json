This topic is created to help begginers or people who want to improve\r\n\r\n\r\nve been playing the game for so much long and i have almost 2000 hours spent on it. Tho i don&#039;t play much ranked games\r\n\r\nBut here are the things i know and they can help you alot. This can help both beginners and expirienced players\r\n\r\n1. **Farming** - If you want to win you must learn how to farm efficiently. Farming really good brings a higher chance of winning because that way you can buy a lot of items that strengthness your champion\r\n\r\n2. **Choosing what items you should buy** - This is very Important because if you choose wrong items your champion will not deal much damage and you will loose the teamfight. You can look what pro-players build when they are playing\r\n\r\n3. **Watch Streams/Esports** - Always watch professional match ups from streams.That way you can learn a lot of new things\r\n\r\n4. **Playing passive or aggressive** - When playing against a person in game. You must see how the person plays. If the person plays really aggressive and damages you alot. You must play passive and just farm [If there is opportunity to throw some free damage do it] - Also when you are not pushing the enemy alot - you open a chance for your jungler to gank\r\n\r\n5. **Put wards** - Many people say that wards are only for the support role. But in fact wards are important for everybody on the team. You must put wards in different places. And always buy {{item:2055}} . Vision gives 60% chance of winning because you know where the enemy position is\r\n\r\n6. **Roam** - If you kill the enemy top laner you can always go to mid and gank. Same goes to bot - If you kill them you can always go to mid. - Roaming gives you a higher chance of winning\r\n\r\n7. **Bait** - When you are 1 vs 1 somebody and when you are seeing your teammates are coming to help you.Try as long as you can to survive (But if you are seeing that he is dealing too much damage to you, just run)  I recommend doing this if you are a tank and you can&#039;t die very easy. But don&#039;t be so calm because the enemy team can also come so you must think before doing that. If you have vision you don&#039;t have to worry about this. There is an other version of this - when you force somebody to attack you and they go right on you - but they don&#039;t realise that your whole team is next to you\r\n\r\n8. **Don&#039;t rage **- Most of people i met in league flame a lot. This problem gives negatives results and you are most likely to loose the game. Don&#039;t rage if you want to get good\r\n\r\n9. **Know when to engage teamfights** - Now this comes by playing the game. When you play the game alot you will understand when to engage and when not - When you start the teamfight and your team is not in very good position (for sure you will loose the teamfight) - The Element of suprise will always make your team win the fight [Always think if its a good idea to attack them or not] Make everything in your mind\r\n\r\n10. **Dodge almost everytime** - Dodging can help you alot because you will not loose any hp.\r\nIf Jinx pokes you down and you are low on Health &gt; (Always think that she will press her Ultimate to finish you - so try to dodge it). Same goes for Ashe - As for Jhin you have to constantly dodge the skillshots (Moving really close left and right from the beggining of the ultimate will confuse the enemy player then try to move left or right\r\n\r\n11. **Protect the ADC** - Supports must protect their adc&#039;s always but not only them - If the whole team protects the whole adc in teamfight - For sure you will win. By doing that the adc will impact a lot of damage on them\r\n\r\n12. **Wards**  - Imagine if you play Jungler and want to gank but you think that there is a ward in the bush - They are too options to avoid getting seen - The first is to go around the ward as far as possible (to get out of the range of the light) And the other one is to take other route to gank \r\n\r\n13. **Counter Ganking** (Jungler) - When you play jungle and you see your teammate is pushing alot (You have to know that the enemy jungler is most likely to gank there - If he comes and you play good you can both kill the top laner and the jungler\r\n\r\n14. **Stealing Jungle Camps (Jungler)** - When you play jungler you should look to steal the enemy Jungle camps (That way you can put him way behind by levels and farm) And he will be not able to gank much\r\n\r\n15. **Camping the other Jungler in the Jungle** - When you play Jungle you can go to the enemy jungle and sit in bush and wait for the other Jungler - Suprise him and take the kill *This option is risky so be carefull\r\n\r\n16. **Try to Steal Baron/Dragons** - Stealing dragon or baron can give your team an extra boost\r\n\r\n17. **Always have a plan in your mind before doing something*\r\n\r\n18. **Predict where the enemy is going to dodge your attack** - This can be tricky but when you master it you will kill anybody and make really cool plays\r\n\r\n19. **Communicate with your team** - Use pings or messages to communicate with your team but don&#039;t spam them alot because you can confuse your team\r\n\r\n20. **Freezing the wave** - To properly set up a freeze, you need an uneven minion wave with 4ish more enemy minions than ally minions. The reason for this is because you want to freeze the wave near your tower, meaning your reinforcement wave will reach the current crashed wave faster than the enemies reinforcement wave does because your wave has less distance to travel. In order to maintain the freeze when the reinforcement wave arrives, the enemy minions have to be killing off your wave faster than your wave can kill off the enemy minions. If they do not kill off your wave faster, then your wave will eventually become bigger and push.","replies":[{"poster":"SOOM","date":"2018-04-22T20:23:52.180+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Put wards - Many people say that wards are only for the support role. \n\nWho tf says that","replies":[{"poster":"Kelg","date":"2018-04-22T21:55:13.771+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MysticLlamaZ,realm=OCE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=1Eg7lsxT,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-04-22T20:23:52.180+0000)\n>\n> Who tf says that\n\nbronze v probably","replies":[]}]}]}
