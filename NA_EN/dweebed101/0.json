He emailed support only to wait three days before getting a response stating they were transferring to another dept. and now it's been another three days yet to recieve any more information. Today, we decided to try his credentials on every region possible without any luck... no lookup tool shows him on any other Region that we've seen, he can't even login to the boards with his info. I've been doing some research and haven't seen any discussions showing an account with this issue getting resolved. I'd just like to get some feedback from you guys that you may have seen this issue and seen the players get their account back? Thanks for your time.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-28T22:50:16.336+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's no random account transfers, so I'm glad your brother contacted support.  Our queue is currently a bit high, so it may be a bit until a response is received.  Our account team will help out as soon as possible!","replies":[]}]}
