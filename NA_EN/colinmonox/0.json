Ever since, upon opening the client, it gives me the &quot;you have earned a key fragment&quot; notice, even though I&#039;ve already combined it into a full key and used it\n\n4) It would be nice to see the champions a friend has available, so I could suggest to my new friends who they should play\n\n5) Skin selection could use some work, should show what skins are owned first, maybe have multiple rows for easier viewing\n\n6) Not sure if due to the client, but my settings reset every time I get in game.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Codebear","date":"2016-11-04T17:44:48.721+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Colinmonox, great feedback! \n\nLove to hear a bit more about some of the issues you're seeing if you have a moment.\n\n1-2.)

Like the option to set up characters builds? If I am wrong and there is a tab then disregard, but i think an entire tab dedicated to viewing summoner spells, and no tab for item sets wasn't the best choice. Please correct me if i'm wrong.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Pink Eater","date":"2016-11-05T01:34:09.336+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While this personal feedback thread is open, I'd love to ask something!\nI know there has to be a community of people who wear glasses (like me) and so far I'm digging the new lay out of things but text and buttons seem to be much smaller on this client. If there was any way to make the window size on the home page setup a little bigger or personalize the size of the window to a user's liking that would be awesome. I'm finding myself squinting a lot more and having a harder time reading this alpha client...I hope it's not just a personal problem for me {{item:3070}}  and that other's are possibly experiencing the same issue.\nThanks!","replies":[]}]}
