This happened right after he closed the client and tried to log in.\r\n\r\nSince I didn't close my client I kept playing just fine on my pc, but after I closed it, my brother asked me to try to log in to his account using my pc, just to be sure if the problem was in his pc. Result: he couldn't log in, even on my pc.\r\n\r\nSince he couldn't log in with his account on my pc, I tried with mine and the same problem happened, and since then I can't log in either, even though it was working just fine a few minutes ago.\r\n\r\nI tried almost everything, but still can log in to the client. I would like some help to fix this problem.\r\n\r\nPS: My brother ever formatted his pc and installed the client from scratch but still no solution to the problem. {{champion:32}} {{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-04-11T23:22:11.988+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What error is coming up when attempting to login?

You might be having a network problem that's blocking you from reaching the authentication server.  Have you recently done any updates to your OS or anti-virus software?  I suggest grabbing the [hextech repair tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367) and using the auto-configure firewall to make sure it's not blocking you from reaching us. \n\nIn addition, go over each step of the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to rule out possibilities.
