How many people are on your team that designs the characters? not kit just the way they look. and How often do you guys practice drawing champs and just your own little creations? I&#039;m kind of interested in the Graphic Design field. And i also just wanted to know how you guys go about some things.","replies":[{"poster":"Kindlejack","date":"2015-08-09T22:27:26.327+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Kazuto Ishin,\n\n- Most artists use Adobe Photoshop for general illustration, but I also see people using Sketchbook Pro and Corel Painter. 3D programs like Sketchup, Maya, 3DStudio Max and ZBrush are also used from time to time for creating geometry in perspective and proxy models.\n\n- There is a team that develop new champions and a team that update existing champions, I don't know the exact numbers on those teams but they have at least a few concept artists.\n\n- Something common of all successful artists is that we practice all the time.
