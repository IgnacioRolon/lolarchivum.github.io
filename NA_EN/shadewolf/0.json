Thornmail was never really meant to be an offensively-inclined item, and seeing as only a few champions could really use it that way, the loss of damage isn't anything I'll be mourning.\n\nEdit: The application of Grievous wounds, even as brief as it is, can't be underestimated. Attacking a Thornmail-laden tank will cut a Soraka's effectiveness on the ADC by half, it'll do the same for summoner heal, Judgement, and so on. The combination of GW , the cold steel passive, and literally any health makes Thornmail into a legit tank purchase instead of an ultra-niche thing that only Rammus and Malph have a real reason to buy.","replies":[{"poster":"Darkdemon653","date":"2017-07-15T12:14:48.463+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=IronwallJackson,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=wX38UnEl,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-07-15T10:33:54.800+0000)\n>\n> It&#x27;s an item meant to reduce how much an enemy carry can use you as a moving health battery, and in that respect, this item is better than it used to be\n\nIt's not. The old damage taken minus healing received through lifesteal was higher than the current damage taken minus healing received through lifesteal. TMail's damage got reduced by a much greater amount than the amount by which GW reduces healing.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Breaku","date":"2017-07-15T10:59:04.804+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"New one is much better, possibly even too strong.
