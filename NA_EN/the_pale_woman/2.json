We're nerfing orange essence disenchant rates and we've been very careful to communicate about it ever since we originally announced these changes: https://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/2017/09/upcoming-changes-to-leveling-ip-rewards/\n\n> Since you’ll be getting so many more shards thanks to the new leveling system (and with other recent changes to honor and events), we’ll tune down the relative value of the essence you get from disenchanting shards **of all types—champ shards, skin shards, and ward skin shards**.... To offset the disenchant rate changes, we’re going to change the way loot chests work so you’ll have a chance to get two drops in each chest. Get ready for chests inside of your chests. We’ll also add “bad luck protection,” so you won’t ever go on long streaks without getting a skin shard or a gemstone from chests.\n\nWe've also posted about this in the preseason FAQ: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/115012640908-Preseason-Update-FAQ\n\nFind that under this question: \"Are you making any changes to the way disenchanting shards works?\"\n\nSorry for the confusion, guys.","replies":[{"poster":"swoov","date":"2017-11-09T06:36:11.005+0000","up_votes":22,"down_votes":2,"body":"how is this fair to post after the pre-season started?
