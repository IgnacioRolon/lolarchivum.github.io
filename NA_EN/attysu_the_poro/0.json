We understand users get frustrated and need a place to vent about their frustrations to the game. Because of this, we have added a new sub-board to the Boards!\n\nIntroducing; the **RANT** board. (~~Which stands for Rambling At New Things not really thought it was clever though~~.) Have a frustration about the game? Want to scream your head off about Riot nerfing your main? Want to scream about how broken Yasuo is? Well, the rant board is the place for you! Please remember to read the Rant Board rules however before posting!

I often make super long replies when I'm angry and then delete them or put them somewhere and read it later. I often find I was clearly wayyy too angry to think rationally. Posts that are literally just hate threads shouldn't be replied to imo, unless you want to rant with them, then just make your own rant. It's good to get your feelings out when you're angry. Rant threads aren't very productive. The millions of Yasuo threads get nothing done for example, despite the tons of comments of people hating with them.

Maybe some people do just rant to get out their frustration but a lot of people actually want to talk about their frustration with other people. By essentially locking the topic and moving it to an archived board, you're shutting them down. Having your topic moved to the Rant board shouldn't necessarily feel like a punishment but that is what will happen if we don't allow people to reply to a user's topics. The person will feel like they're being ignored and I think overall this will hurt the community. \n\nThe Gameplay board shouldn't be cluttered with people ranting about their hate for a champion or why a champion is busted but for that to not happen, people need a board where they can rant about stuff like this with other people and feel like they're reaching an audience. The Rants board is great for that but it needs to allow people to reply for posters to feel like their voice is heard and ultimately for the board to be successful at it's intended purpose.","replies":[{"poster":"Wulf Helhammer","date":"2019-03-05T06:42:17.570+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":11,"body":"If they want to discuss their frustration, then they should make an intelligent post with logical follow through and evidence, not just one that relies on rage and ignores facts.","replies":[{"poster":"I love cowboys","date":"2019-03-05T07:05:15.601+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Wilk Łucznik,realm=NA,application-id=6heBIhQc,discussion-id=oXu8xQ5v,comment-id=0004000100010000,timestamp=2019-03-05T06:42:17.570+0000)\n>\n> If they want to discuss their frustration, then they should make an intelligent post with logical follow through and evidence, not just one that relies on rage and ignores facts.\n\nI get that argument, but I feel RANT should be a bit more than just a dumping ground for poor quality gameplay threads. RANT threads don't show up on the front page (and should stay that way, in my opinion) so I don't see how big of a harm allowing replies would be, so that angry people can vent and feel like they're not just shouting into a pillow. \nRight now I can definitely see how someone who's mad at Yasuo or something has no reason to put their thread on RANT so they'll probably just put it on gameplay anyway, so there's not much progress to be made. But I feel like if discussion on RANT is allowed it'll potentially improve discussion on the gameplay boards as well, since angry people who just want to vent and have their voice heard will naturally move to RANT (either through having their thread moved or having the outrage community commute there over time) and gameplay can be actual gameplay discussion again.\n\nRight now RANT just feels like a thread graveyard, and really doesn't accomplish much more than that.","replies":[{"poster":"Karunamon","date":"2019-03-05T07:17:30.694+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=I love cowboys,realm=NA,application-id=6heBIhQc,discussion-id=oXu8xQ5v,comment-id=00040001000100000000,timestamp=2019-03-05T07:05:15.601+0000)\n>\n> Right now RANT just feels like a thread graveyard, and really doesn't accomplish much more than that.\n\nYep. \n\n$10 worth of RP says the board is declared a failure like Gameplay+ and shuttered inside of a year.

I'm not a fanboy, and if you read my profile I have both defended and criticized Riot's decisions.
