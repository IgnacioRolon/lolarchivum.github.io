My internet connection seems to be normal without any spiking. My usual ping is 58 and I have asked some of my friends living in my area and they all seem to be facing the same problem as me.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-21T01:27:15.052+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mentioning that your friends living in the same area are having the same issues makes it sound like it might be somehow related to an ISP issue rather than something going wrong with the server traffic. Let's go ahead and do a quick check up on your [**network settings**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to make sure everything is still in order there.

I had a 112 and lower ping before and it was playable but 130+ is a making it hard. Another weird thing is my ping before would fluctuate a bit but now its a solid 130 all the time.

Oh and I can't submit a reply to the ticket, either.\n\nLike, I've been a devout player since forever but I'm getting really close to the point where I'm just gonna say fuck it and uninstall and that's saying a lot. This shit is really pissing me off especially considering there is nothing I can do to fix it since it's either you or the ISP's.  I have Frontier btw.\n\nThere have been posts from other people on the west coast about an increase in ping, and people ingame have mentioned it besides myself so clearly there is an issue that isn't limited to just me. \n\nI'll check up in a week, hopefully this is resolved by then.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Femt√≥","date":"2017-07-21T01:29:46.374+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"having same prob tried all of troubleshooting that the support person told me and it didnt work it makes my game feel unplayable and is making me wanna quit league tbh","replies":[]}]}]}
