You can also return to the legacy client through the following means:\n\n-  On the login screen of the open beta updated client, look for the \"Launch Legacy Client\" text at the bottom.\n-  Or create a shortcut directly to the legacy client in your League Installation. Just look for \"lol.launcher\"\n\nHope that helps.","replies":[{"poster":"Fort Knocks","date":"2016-11-21T19:09:53.133+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I meant like I cant download the Beta client at all.
