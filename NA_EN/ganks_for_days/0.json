Although I noticed in this past game that it seems as though I can still see everyone's movements in real-time, it is just response. Although when the delay gets bad (2 secs or more) I get \"reconnecting.\"\r\nNot sure if I should reinstall or where to start diagnosing the cause since initial tests are showing my internet is not the issue (good ping, and internet test coming strong)","replies":[{"poster":"Neuciler","date":"2016-11-03T21:20:05.569+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Having the same issue, will keep in touch if I find out anything","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-03T18:24:37.725+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You might be having packet loss, which can cause input delay.

Reset router/Modem\n2. Connected device directly to router (cut out wi-fi)\n3. Turned off Large IPv4/6 offloading\n4. Checked firmware on router and Ethernet driver updates\n5. QoS optimization\n\nThrough all this, nothing changed.\n\nThen I noticed I had enabled manual DHCP assignment and set the MAC address of my PC to 199 (192.168.0.199) - however since I had changed from wi-fi to direct lan, I figured I'd remove that. Then I noticed I also set the available pool for DHCP from 192.168.0.2 ~ 192.168.0.198, while reading someone had mentioned checking the DHCP range to have 2-3 digits in minimum range. I corrected this and now am getting over 10mbps upload speed (and my download speed improved to 180 mbps hehe) downloaded the game over again in under 30 mins.\nI will update this tomorrow when I get a chance to play a few games and see if the issue is resolved.","replies":[]}]}
