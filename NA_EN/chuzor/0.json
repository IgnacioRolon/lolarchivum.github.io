I played a long time ago and decided to start again, and take the tutorial. The tutorial gets to the step \"Press B to recall\" pressing B does nothing. There is no recall icon just a see through circle and clicking that does nothing.\r\n\r\nIs the tutorial glitched or am I missing something obvious here?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-08T22:58:32.801+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There may be an issue with one or more of your keybindings that's causing this issue. You should be able to resolve this after taking a moment to reset your input file that's saved server-side using the steps below:\n\nFirst,  **log into the League Client** then hop into your install directory:\n\n>**C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends**\n\nDelete the folder named **Config**.\n\nOnce you've deleted that folder, hop into a custom match or the tutorial to confirm the **B key** actually does something now. Let me know if this worked!","replies":[{"poster":"Chuzor","date":"2017-01-08T23:41:06.743+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That fixed it, thanks!","replies":[]}]}]}
