That's not what I'm worried about though, ever since it finally finished downloading I've been trying to log in. I enter my username and password and when I hit enter it sits there on \"Authenticating...\" for about 5-7 minutes then tells me \"An unexpected error has occurred while logging in.\" The one time I did get logged in everything was so slow it wouldn't even load the home page (again, pretty high end PC and everything else is running smooth as ever). I tried the \"full repair\" to no avail, I tried enabling low-spec mode to maybe reduce client lag, didn't work. I tried downloading the Hextech Repair Tool but when I try to run it it'll get all the way to the \"Gathering Logs\" part and then I get a \"Chromium Embedded Framework Client Application has stopped working\" error.\r\n\r\nI'm about to go out of my freaking mind. I'm trying to do everything I can without having to reinstall League because it took nearly 4 hours and I'm not willing to wait that long again. Someone please help me before I start smashing shit.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-18T21:19:45.457+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Getting stuck on authenticating while trying to login just means your network wasn't able to get a clear signal with the login servers.

However, the client was so laggy that it wouldn't even load the home page. So I tried your solution and it didn't work at all. No change whatsoever, still over here on Authenticating watching this little wheel spin... anything else you can tell me?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-19T00:16:01.773+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's alright, go ahead and run through the other steps in that guide if you haven't yet to cover all the basics.
