It may take a moment for match history to update, including any third party sites.  We don't support these third party sites, and cannot force them to provide updates.  I hope that helps clear things up, and wish you the best of luck in your series!","replies":[{"poster":"BIG DADDY CHAD","date":"2016-07-15T18:58:37.655+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Awesome thank you!\nI literally did not know where to see this on the app...

In the client, go to your Profile and select Leagues.  The left side should show your division's ladderboard, and the right should provide your series progress so far with green checkmarks.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-07-15T09:24:24.819+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Those sites are simply not updated.
