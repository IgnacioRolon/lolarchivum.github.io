The lag is unreal. Makes the game completely playable.  Running around with random frames. This last match I just played was super bad with lag. (The ping number doesnt even rise), but it's like I everything is in a standstill, but you can see your health dropping when attacked etc. This is ruining the game.  I am actually debating quitting league at this point.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Aura of Aiur","date":"2016-07-13T19:18:05.395+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=xARISENE,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=jxbgecOm,comment-id=,timestamp=2016-07-13T18:15:16.014+0000)\n>\n> I have been asking in game and it seems a lot of people are experiencing some hindering lag...

It has been the last 5 days for me lag spikes randomly happening to me every match i play regardless of what champion I use.\nRiot needs to fix this as it is a issue that so many peope are experiencing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KÃ¼rama","date":"2016-07-13T18:33:55.487+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"[Troubleshoot your connectivity issues.](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues)\n\nhttp://na.leagueoflegends.com/sites/default/files/styles/scale_xlarge/public/upload/su16_keyart_1920x1080_0.jpg?itok=6nj8mHjj","replies":[]}]}
