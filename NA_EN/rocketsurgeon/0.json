Ive been looking to switch servers sense i moved back to America. I went out and bought a RP card thinking i could use that bc my card is acting weird, anyway i come back and try to use the RP card and come to find out that you cant use RP cards from any other region accept the one that it was bought from. So i guess my question is: is there a way to change the RP (USD) to RP (Euro) so that i can use the card and transfer back to NA?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-26T04:39:49.165+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Be sure to reach out to our billing team in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).
