He has the Urgot problem...

Right now its just a bunch of low damage with some moderately useful CC, but why would anybody pick him over a similar champ like Lissandra who is safer, and deals more damage from a greater range?\n\nI'd love to see him designed as a jungler really.

There is no reason to silence yourself for 1 second for something that only works when you autoattack in melee range.

(reduce 10% cdr if they do that). The only way to viably play him imo is in the jungle and that is heavily gated by the massive mana consumption to the point where you either take every blue (your mids will dislike you) or you can only farm 2 camps then gank to use all your mana.\n\nAnd despite butchering his bases and scalings (esp the Q change) he still works best as a full ap burst. The only tanky item that synergises well with him and only works in lane is Rod of Ages. And this is largely only because of the W channel time. You can't viably channel all the time (because it invalidates you for so long) for sustained damage, it's much more convenient to charge it up slam into someone and unleash full burst then back off until your cooldowns are up again.

Both Alistar and Gragas have the issue that as soon as they become decently viable, their kits immediately flip into being totally OP. They are always either super UP or super OP, and they flop between win rates in the low 40s with awful pick rate to win rates in the high 50s with pick or ban status.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Drunk Rummate","date":"2015-01-27T20:54:55.317+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Orangesilk,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=wmlsQEi4,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2015-01-27T20:47:01.599+0000)\n>\n> Wasn't he an important pick at worlds?, I think he's like Alistar in how wildly different he plays when played by a pro compared to a non-pro, pushbacks are extremely powerful abilities, especially Gragas'\n\nsince being a contested pick in competitive he's actually been nerfed. his winrate in competitive was actually pretty mediocre as well.  i believe professionals overestimated his base stats. we saw a lot of tank gragas players who almost always lost, and we saw some deathcap + lich bane gragas' who won a little more.  since then his waveclear has been nerfed by 30% on his Q though, so the deathcap gragas is worse.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Tabs","date":"2015-01-27T20:15:51.636+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He doesn't feel as fun to play anymore, which is a shame because I received Santa Gragas as my mystery gift skin from Riot.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CoolKnightST","date":"2015-01-28T15:06:13.371+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"His rework was a succes till they overnerfed him offcourse. He lost everything his new kit stands for:\n\n* Burst on his W\n* Sustain from his passive\n* Some damage from his Q\n\nWhe just need our lane bully into lategame tank back. He need some tweaks but and I think it has mostly todo with his scaling. An change I really want to see on him:\n\n* Drunken Rage: Buff his base damage values again & let it scale with bonus health.\n* Body Slam: Replace the AP scaling with maximum health scaling. He litterly smash his belly against the enemy. Look more to health scaling to me.\n\nThat would mean Gragas has:\n\n* Q: AP scaling\n* W: Bonus Health & AP scaling\n* E: Maximum Health scaling\n* R: AP scaling\n\nIt would fit his build a lot of better. So will he probaly rush {{item:3136}} for snowballing or take the {{item:3027}} route for slow scaling. Gragas is no longer the mage he ones was. Just increase his potentional as a AP bruiser & let him him scale better from tanky items.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Erockandroll","date":"2015-01-28T03:26:32.403+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I currently have Gragas in my back Pocket as a Junger.

It's his W that makes him feel clunky.  Adding a mana cost was a bad idea.  If they gave him back his OLD OLD W from 2 years ago that reduced damage taken for like 12 seconds then he would be in a good spot as a tanky AP that could jungle.","replies":[]}]}
