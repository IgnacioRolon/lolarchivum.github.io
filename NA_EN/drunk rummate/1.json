{"poster":"Drunk Rummate","date":"2015-04-20T14:22:37.123+0000","title":"Dear Esteemed Jungler","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":89,"down_votes":6,"body":"I love you.  In a platonic way of course.  When you come mid lane to gank my enemy laner and blow their flash, that&#039;s something I don&#039;t forget.  If you want to tax me every time you gank, go right on ahead.  I appreciate your presence in this game.  Your mere attempts at ganks put pressure on my opponent, force them to buy wards, and allow me to lane much more aggressively.  So thank you.\n\nI also have some advice for you, if you would be willing to listen.\n\n1.  I know that blue buff improves your clear speeds.  Depending on the champion you&#039;re playing {{champion:9}} {{champion:76}} {{champion:131}} , I may not even request the second one, but here&#039;s what you need to understand about blue buff on **me** and how it impacts my game.  Without mana gating, I&#039;m allowed to spam my abilities on the wave to shove my opponent into turret.  This allows me to throw abilities like my charm {{champion:103}} at my opponent on cooldown, significantly increasing my kill pressure in lane.  Furthermore, shoving in lane without a mana cost gives me ample opportunity to roam.  If I don&#039;t think I can kill my lane opponent, it&#039;s highly likely I&#039;ll take this opportunity to roam to a side lane *or invade the enemy jungle with you* while my wave is pushed.  This makes your job a LOT easier and a LOT safer, and should be considered a massive benefit to you!\n\n2.  When I recall or leave my lane to gank and you go there to pick up the experience and farm I appreciate it.  I really am glad that you&#039;re covering my tower in my absence, because that tower makes farming a lot easier for me and I would hate to give up the global gold and map pressure that it offers.  However please understand how wave control functions, and leave the minion wave in an acceptable place for me when I return to farm.  Especially early on, if you halfheartedly shove the wave and my opponent freezes it I could potentially lose out on a LOT of cs as a result.  So either last hit carefully and keep the wave on my side, or make sure you 100% push the wave into their tower.  **PS: I recommend last hitting carefully almost 100% of the time, because there&#039;s no telling when an enemy jungler (or my lane opponent) may show up to get the farm that you&#039;re pushing into them, forcing you to leave and resulting in a poor shove and freeze.**\n\n3.  When you gank my lane and get that big cooldown (heal, barrier, flash, ultimate) don&#039;t be afraid to come back.  Maybe we whiffed the first time, but that cooldown will be down for awhile and if you have red buff especially then you bring a ton of kill pressure to my flash-less opponent.  Getting flash will certainly help me lane and force them to play safer, but don&#039;t you want the 100-300 gold for that kill you&#039;ve already set up?  I certainly do.\n\n4.  This last one is for you farming junglers.  I  understand that your power curve starts at level 6 or later.  I know how important it is that you&#039;re efficient in your farming to get that power spike as quickly as possible.  I accept that you aren&#039;t actively ganking lanes, and I&#039;m probably playing very safe as a result.  However, if I corner my lane opponent and you&#039;re in the vicinity, *please come help me.*  If I&#039;ve got an almost guaranteed kill, it&#039;s likely I just need another warm body to zone my opponent out.  You may even get lucky and get the kill gold!  If you see I'm getting ganked, or especially if they're diving me under tower - please come save me!!  In return, I promise I&#039;ll come help when I see my opponent invade your jungle.  Pinky swear. \n\nThanks esteemed jungler, and remember - I love you (platonically). \n\n-Nasreth","replies":[{"poster":"Solidair3","date":"2015-04-20T15:09:28.113+0000","up_votes":76,"down_votes":0,"body":"Platonically?

But that risk is more than worth the potential benefit, which is why it's commonly done.  Giving blue to your mid is essentially freeing them up to hard shove the lane and help gank; it opens up the door for 4 man ganks, duo or trio (with support) jungle invades, and a plethora of other strategic options that you would otherwise not have access to.\n\nIf you're tired of people asking you for a gank every 30 seconds, consider that freeing up your mid lane with blue buff would allow them to cover up some of those holes for you and give you more opportunities elsewhere.","replies":[{"poster":"Partholonian","date":"2015-04-20T22:34:32.451+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Keeping the blue risks losing it too, unless you intend to JUST sit in the jungle for the whole duration (in which case, what do you need it for?)\n\nUnless 0% of your ganks result in your own death, which would be really impressive because even pros can't say that.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Nucleophilic atk","date":"2015-04-21T22:11:45.989+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Exactly why I do not give blue buff if my mid laner is either dying or not warding....basically if they aren't good.

Pull the minions in a perpendicular direction away from the turret before they reach it and your laner will absolutely adore you for it.  If you pull this off properly it even sets up a gank opportunity - the enemy laner will have to come forward to CS, so if you stick around and do raptors or wolves you can come back for an easy kill.","replies":[{"poster":"Penta Penguin","date":"2015-04-20T22:15:10.790+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thanks","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Dracpro","date":"2015-04-20T16:01:06.629+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Can we like duo...plz.

If I don&#039;t think I can kill my lane opponent, it&#039;s highly likely I&#039;ll take this opportunity to roam to a side lane *or invade the enemy jungle with you* while my wave is pushed.  This makes your job a LOT easier and a LOT safer, and should be considered a massive benefit to you!\n> \n> 2.  When I recall or leave my lane to gank and you go there to pick up the experience and farm I appreciate it.  I really am glad that you&#039;re covering my tower in my absence, because that tower makes farming a lot easier for me and I would hate to give up the global gold and map pressure that it offers.  However please understand how wave control functions, and leave the minion wave in an acceptable place for me when I return to farm.  Especially early on, if you halfheartedly shove the wave and my opponent freezes it I could potentially lose out on a LOT of cs as a result.  So either last hit carefully and keep the wave on my side, or make sure you 100% push the wave into their tower.  **PS: I recommend last hitting carefully almost 100% of the time, because there&#039;s no telling when an enemy jungler (or my lane opponent) may show up to get the farm that you&#039;re pushing into them, forcing you to leave and resulting in a poor shove and freeze.**\n> \n> 3.  When you gank my lane and get that big cooldown (heal, barrier, flash, ultimate) don&#039;t be afraid to come back.  Maybe we whiffed the first time, but that cooldown will be down for awhile and if you have red buff especially then you bring a ton of kill pressure to my flash-less opponent.  Getting flash will certainly help me lane and force them to play safer, but don&#039;t you want the 100-300 gold for that kill you&#039;ve already set up?  I certainly do.\n> \n> 4.  This last one is for you farming junglers.  I  understand that your power curve starts at level 6 or later.  I know how important it is that you&#039;re efficient in your farming to get that power spike as quickly as possible.  I accept that you aren&#039;t actively ganking lanes, and I&#039;m probably playing very safe as a result.  However, if I corner my lane opponent and you&#039;re in the vicinity, *please come help me.*  If I&#039;ve got an almost guaranteed kill, it&#039;s likely I just need another warm body to zone my opponent out.  You may even get lucky and get the kill gold!  If you see I'm getting ganked, or especially if they're diving me under tower - please come save me!!  In return, I promise I&#039;ll come help when I see my opponent invade your jungle.  Pinky swear. \n> \n> Thanks esteemed jungler, and remember - I love you (platonically). \n> \n> -Nasreth\n\nDear Laner.\n\n1. Blue does more then increase clear speed, it allows me to gank lanes more often. Unfortunately if i do not get to those lanes fast enough im going to get yelled at for not ganking. Besides the fact that a third of the time the blue i give ends up on the other team :/. The time your spending ganking our teams lane could be time you spend pushing while i gank as an assassin... but then your mid lane AND the lane you are in are now ungankable unless i Am there with you, however mids never... ever, wait for the jungler.\n\n2. I understand if you just go to base to buy and return, but if your going to take a ganking oppertunity away from me, i NEED to push your lane because your taking possible gold from me ganking a lane before im there, so now im left with two lanes i cant gank  and an empty lane that i need to catch up on because i could potentially lose out on a LOT of gold as a result. But i can not stay in lane like a laner, if im halfway done and i need to be elsewhere i just leave... i can not stay as i am not a laner, just as people can not rely on mid to gank lanes every game because mid is a laner.\n\n3. Maybe we whiffed the first time, maybe because his stuff is on cooldown he is going to play more defensively, as somebody should who just lost a fight and had to use summoners... Your opponent knows he/she is flashless, he/she will be doing what they can without it. Getting their flash willl certainly help your lane, but if they use flash and you dont, you should be able to deal with your lane after that.\n\n4. 100% agree.\n\nEsteemed jungler~ :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"delios","date":"2015-04-22T12:07:19.330+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If I see my mid lane die, I instantly can't trust them with a Blue.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Facade45","date":"2015-04-22T08:46:06.906+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol.. if only you said that to all junglers.

I don't main jungle but when I play, it's difficult to follow all the advices u said above. Maybe if riot added tutorials for those things, it could be solved. :D","replies":[]},{"poster":"Squidblimp","date":"2015-04-22T04:18:35.733+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dear esteemed mid-laner: you may have my buffs, but only if you ask nicely.
