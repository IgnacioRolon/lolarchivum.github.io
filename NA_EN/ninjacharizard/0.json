So, he banned kayn, and it was in the last few seconds of the timer so he didn&#039;t realize someone had him selected. He in no way intentionally banned the person&#039;s champion, and they didn&#039;t seem to mind much so everything was cool. Fast forward to in game, the person decided to play xin zhao instead and wasn&#039;t doing very well, and decided to bring up how my friend (playing morgana) caused him to do badly because they banned kayn. Xin stressed that morgana must have done it intentionally and said we were trolling. I defended my friend, saying that it made no sense to say everything was okay before, but now blame us as soon as he does badly. Xin continued saying we were trolling because we didn&#039;t want to surrender when the rest of the team wasn&#039;t doing very well, even though we were still doing well and thought we had a chance. Xin started refusing to group with us and ignoring the enemies coming into our base, so I told him that he was trolling because he was giving up, and we were legitimately trying to play the game. Here are the chat logs riot gave me for why I was chat restricted:\n\nGame 1\nNinjaCharizard: rip\nNinjaCharizard: ty\nNinjaCharizard: why\nNinjaCharizard: stop going so deep just farm up dude\nNinjaCharizard: just farm\nNinjaCharizard: bot lane was gonna go in you shouldnt have chased\nNinjaCharizard: just play passive\nNinjaCharizard: bot in winning hard\nNinjaCharizard: *bot is\nNinjaCharizard: ok well farm as much as you can without dying\nNinjaCharizard: thats all u can do rn\nNinjaCharizard: its ok\nNinjaCharizard: dude dont try to bring that shit up as if you lost just cause you didnt get kayn\nNinjaCharizard: it was an accident\nNinjaCharizard: what reason does he have to ban your champion\nNinjaCharizard: LMAO so it wasnt a big deal then, but as soon as you feed its his fault\nNinjaCharizard: sure buddy\nNinjaCharizard: youre the troll\nNinjaCharizard: ^\nNinjaCharizard: reporting you for attitude\nNinjaCharizard: i have my own vote for a reason lmao\nNinjaCharizard: im not surrendering\nNinjaCharizard: complain all you want\nNinjaCharizard: idc\nNinjaCharizard: were not trolling&gt;\nNinjaCharizard: if anything you are\nNinjaCharizard: cause youre giving up\nNinjaCharizard: thats reportable\nNinjaCharizard: so\nNinjaCharizard: i love how were &quot;trolling&quot; because were actually trying to play the game\nNinjaCharizard: ok buddy\nNinjaCharizard: idc\nNinjaCharizard: report xin trolling\nNinjaCharizard: youre sitting in jungle while they take base\nNinjaCharizard: hes been calling bot lane troll all game because morg accidently banned kayn\nNinjaCharizard: it was a literal accident\nNinjaCharizard: we apologized profusely\n\nI can see that I had an accusatory tone when talking to him, but I really didn&#039;t say anything that was insulting whatsoever. I told him it was an accident that my friend banned his champion, that we didn&#039;t want to surrender, and that he was trolling because he was giving up. I&#039;m really just confused as to how this amounts to a chat restriction, especially considering I've had no prior restrictions.","replies":[{"poster":"Quinzley","date":"2018-03-12T15:35:59.684+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"How is this worthy of a ban?\nRiot are over-sensitive when it comes to stuff like this.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cynikul","date":"2018-03-12T10:48:14.878+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"One of the few cases I see to be legitimate.
