Loving all of the changes and positive things you all have been adding! Something weird happened a few days ago and again last night. As I created a full key from three key fragments, my one hextech chest disappeared from my loot. Unfortunately I was unable to capture this since my Nvidia Shadowplay is only set on my in-game screen and not my client. The same thing happened again yesterday only this time the three fragments made a key and then both that key and chest disappeared. So in total (1 key and 2 chests) were lost. I do understand that this is a newer feature and is prone to some bugs. I'm not too worried about it, just wanted to report it in case someone is really dependent on them. Thank you guys for doing all you do, and keep up the good work! VERY excited for season 8. I'm going to grind it out and try to improve my skill level in other positions!\r\n\r\n-Doc Stock","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-12T05:18:13.345+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm looking through your recent hextech loot now, and I can't seem to find where any chests or keys might have gone missing. Definitely willing to look into this deeper, but it's hard to know where something went wrong without knowing exactly where to look. Do you happen to remember the dates and a roundabout time when you forged those key fragments so I have a better place to start looking?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kabooki","date":"2018-01-12T05:58:46.182+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Broporo,\n\nWell, to slim it down. I created one key tonight from three fragments which ended up staying in my inventory. The most previous two chests that I have acquired both disappeared. One was probably on the 9th or 10th of January. The other I believe was yesterday. Like I said, it's not a huge deal, and I don't want to inconvenience anybody. Just thought you all should know. I'm positive that they weren't opened because I didn't receive any new \"loot\". Maybe I did receive something but it was just bugged. Anyways, looking forward to hear from ya!","replies":[]}]}
