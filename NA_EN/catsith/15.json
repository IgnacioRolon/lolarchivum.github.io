She doesnt have dmg issues she has mana and clear issues. Her multicamp clear sucks ASS combined with the fact that her mana costs are cripplingly high. Clear raids with elise lvl 3 with no blue/red buff and see how long it takes. the only form of multiclear she has is her human form W and that doesnt do any dmg at all in the early stages. Suggested buffs is giving elise and her spiderlings temp increased attack speed when they kill a unit + lower mana cost/higher manabar. After elise's spiderform W attack speed buffs ends theres legit nothing for her to do so you have to switch between human form and spiderform 5 times and kite when You're doing raides. Her high mana costs basically make her a sucker for blue buff and it getting invaded means your early game is gone.\n\nEdit* the e buff is nice but pointless to its not nidalee in which you use q and then use it again a few seconds later. Youre forcing the enemy to decided between flashing or getting hit. E cooldown isnt relevent since you max it out last and assuming 25+ min elise's job to get her team ahead is over. Elise also doesnt buy any cdr or barely which means it stays 10+ cooldown late game.\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"AirKingNeo","date":"2018-03-27T18:20:57.565+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Doesn't seem to be listed on Surrender@20, but I just want some Rhaast top.\n\nAlso, Conqueror kinda sucks and it's only good on Jax.

Early game junglers in general are pushed out of the role in favor of tanks and effective gankers.

A sheen build, maybe a BotRK in there, and just fill the gaps as the situation warranted while remaining in spider form most of the game is how I'd want to play her.\n\nI probably am overthinking this as I keep forgetting I need to account for her human form.
