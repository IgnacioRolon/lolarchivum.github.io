But AP Elise will push down towers extremely fast after this change so splitting might suit her.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"LankPants","date":"2015-07-16T09:15:00.070+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"So we're back to stunbot Elise jungle.\n\nWonderful.

The real issue is that she can't build damage while investing enough into defense, so she is probably the single riskiest assassin in the game to play should she build full glass cannon. And unfortunately no amount of reward (damage) currently justifies the risk of taking glass cannon Elise into a team fight.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"so chad","date":"2015-07-16T18:06:42.916+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"These are nice buffs, but shouldn't any attempt to help Elise right now start with her W?

As someone who has been asking for Elise buffs as well, I think these buffs go too far. 1.6 second stun for level 1 E?, that is ridiculously powerful. I would not be surprised if she becomes the TOP early game jungler after 5.14. In addition, her spiderlings now do MAGIC damage and has a buffed ratio, meaning she will clear faster, and will benefit even more from penetration items. Basically, I think these changes make her OP, but I don't think they fix Elise's core problems in her power curve which is still going to fall off heavily after the early game. I actually think these buffs are going to end up getting her nerfed again as the meta is shifting away from the \"tank meta\" into something more favorable to Elise.","replies":[{"poster":"CatSith","date":"2015-07-17T08:31:15.998+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"She orignally had a 1.5 stun before it was changed to 1/1.3/1.5/1.7/2 stun.","replies":[{"poster":"Hard4Hamsters","date":"2015-07-17T17:51:02.388+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And that was when she was really strong.
