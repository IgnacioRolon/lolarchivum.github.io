Even with his cd reduction ult and passive those are really short cds. But why do they reduce the mana cost also? isn&#039;t that counter intuitive? He stacks mana for damage and his cds would allow him to dish out alot of spells so for counterplay he has to watch how much he spends. So why is it balance to reduce  the mana cost? \n\n\nI&#039;m just curious, please don&#039;t kill me. :(","replies":[{"poster":"RiotRepertoir","date":"2015-06-10T07:17:11.282+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Q's mana cost was set to a flat value so it didn't feel like it was wrong to rank it up.\n\nE's mana cost was reduced at later ranks because you'll be casting it more often.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Dusteon","date":"2015-06-10T00:34:45.343+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Probably because the damage was nerfed and he needs much more QEs to get a second W off now.","replies":[]}]}
