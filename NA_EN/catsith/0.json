It says you cleaned up the logic on her double up, but what does this mean exactly? Something I find frustrating when playing MF is that it seems to almost always prioritize minions. Is this what you fixed? It would be nice for it to prioritize champions (I think it used to?)

At least that's what I'm hopeful for.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-07-07T20:19:19.411+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"From what I understand, yes.
