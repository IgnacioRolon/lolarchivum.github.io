Patch 5.12 is coming our way and players feel like these changes won&#039;t impact on her play ability that much.  So are there plans soon to be revealed or was this just a band aid for the time being?","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2015-06-23T07:26:58.907+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"No other changes planned yet. We want to assess the impact the 5.12 changes to her have, when combined with Runeglaive and the wider AP item changes in 5.13, before considering any other adjustments.","replies":[{"poster":"CatSith","date":"2015-06-23T07:53:55.463+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is there a possibility to buff her base stats before/in patch 5.13? Since her power is being  push towards her spider form. She will be in melee range most of the time, but unlike other melee mages she lacks defensive stats (Fizz, Diana, Rumble, and Katarina.) Which is hp and Mr resistance.  That is understandable because she has a ranged form. But unlike the other Ranged/Melee formed champions they have benefits in their melee form. Gnar gains increased base stats in mega form, and Jayce gains a defense bonus of 5 / 15 / 25 / 35( armor and MR.)","replies":[]},{"poster":"CatSith","date":"2015-06-24T00:41:21.096+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why was her heal so rushed to nerf again??

I still think she's pretty OP as is - especially vs. melee tops considering you can harass all day with ranged Q, then get your mana back with a couple of doran's rings and never miss a cs because W is an AA reset and Q is a low CD, manaless execute.\n\nEDIT: I'm probably also never going to get that new jungle item. If I want a spellblade active I'll get a lich bane. I don't even go past smite enchantments anymore except for challenging smite cinderhulk and even that is slowly getting nerfed into oblivion.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sachabot","date":"2015-06-23T14:15:24.170+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":".....Is that a Red in G&B?\n\nJokes aside, I'd hope they're careful with her, as I don't want to see a freelo Elise patch, but I want her to be playable. I'd imagine Riot is aiming for a tad undertuned this patch, for reasons stated in the other comments.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tourian","date":"2015-06-23T20:39:27.138+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol nevermind. It looks like riot couldn't stand leaving her buff alone while it was decent. \"Heal on hit value lowered to [4/6/8/10 + (.15 AP)] from [5/10/15/20 (+.15AP)]\" Now, before testing it on the pbe even one day to see if ti was too low, they decide to push out to live the ratio lowered from .15 to .10. I had a feeling they'd do one of these under the radar \"right before the patch hits\" things.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tourian","date":"2015-06-23T14:04:12.126+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I kinda figured after the AP item announcement that this is why they were taking it slow with her. The potential Rylais, liandrys, voidstaff, and abyssal changes impact her pretty hard. Even WOTA which isn't typically taken on her has potential to synergize with her new passive.","replies":[{"poster":"CatSith","date":"2015-06-23T15:00:29.367+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol the item changes doesn't impact her pretty hard.  Voidstaff was only increased by 10 ap and you shouldn't even build that for Elise. Only noticeable changes would be good for Elise is Rylais, and liandrys. Abyssal changes are iffy until its finalized.  \n\nElise's new heal may give her a little more sustain but its enough to keep her in late game fights without building tanky.  \n\nSince they are adding more power to her spider form why aren't they fixing the problem she has in team fights and builds.  The new rappel is rewarding players for using it as an engage in fights for more damage but she is still going to be squishy like she was before. \nWhat is the use of doing more damage if you are still dying at the same rate? \n\n So then you have to build tanky to take enough damage but lose alot of her power from her abilities.  The 2 changes she received are minor. It isn't addressing her Squishyness as a mage that is required to be in melee form to use her full potential.  Every other melee mages have defensive stats and so does melee/range champions gnar and jayce.  So why not elise?

As someone who basically plays exclusively Elise and has access to the pbe, the changes this patch and the next one are looking juicy as hell.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
