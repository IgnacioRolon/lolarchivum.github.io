Believe it or not, she was originally wicked pink! There's a method behind the madness in terms of why her outfit is the color it is.\n\nhttp://s3.amazonaws.com/leaguesales/images/imgs/000/000/978/original/blood-moon-elise-02.jpg\n\nPlayers had a lot to say about her being pink and not reading as Blood Moon. So, we took it back for discussion and 100% agreed with the community, so we made her really red. \n\nOnce players saw the new one, there became a 50/50 split as to which color was preferred, and which looked better for the thematic. Once again, the team got together and discussed what we would do that would make the community happy, but would also be the best option for Blood Moon Elise.\n\nThe result? We opted for a happy medium (a reddish pink), that meshed better with the gold pieces, and also kept her away from being too red, since her base model uses red.\n\nhttp://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Nxqh53j-BNo/VII1TEHWxpI/AAAAAAAAfBY/ErIxDUbMQUI/s1600/elise1.jpg","replies":[]},{"poster":"GiveMeUrMilk","date":"2017-01-25T21:23:09.129+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"She is already red though?
