Is it simply a basic case of resources? It's just odd that you do a visual upgrade and not include a recall. Feature creep has meant that any champion without a recall now just looks out of place today especially when recalling next to someone who does (and especially Pool Party Ziggs next to the rest of the line :S ). It's extra odd that you guys are happy to spend the resources to give new skins their own unique recalls yet leave these other champs without a recall at all even when giving them touchups which would seem like the perfect opportunity to add one in (seriously if she even needs one MF won't be getting a full blown VU for years and years and years from now so this would be like the only opportunity to do so :/ ).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CatSith","date":"2015-07-09T18:38:51.139+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since its a Minor VU, she won't get a VO or Recall.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CatSith","date":"2015-07-09T18:25:34.830+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ty for the reply! :D","replies":[]}]}]}
