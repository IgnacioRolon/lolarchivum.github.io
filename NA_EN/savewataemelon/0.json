Please help me","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So, someone scammed me for some free RP and I'm so dumb to believe such a stranger that it's true. I submitted a request already about 'Recovering my account' to Riot Support and I'm wondering how long would it take for them to reply and take action. I'm really sad for losing my account because I worked hard for it and also mad to myself for not thinking wisely. Please help me and I'm sorry for my bad English. I tried my best to explain my situation as clearly as I can. My Summoner Username in game is 'wataemelon'.\n\nAlso, I still have my account log in to my computer and I can still go through my settings, but the email and password are different from what I have originally. It shows that the email is _^^^^515@gmail.com_. I can't change anything unless I put the correct password or email.\n\nPlease help me and Thank You very much. _- from wataemelon_","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-12T18:15:57.951+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wanted to look into this for you, but I wasn't able to locate a ticket.

They have to make sure they have the evidence to let them know who is the real one.\n\nas far as how long, it could potentially even be a week as far as I know. What's more important, making sure they make the correct call and help you restore rightful access to you and potentially undo harmful changes to your account, or getting to play the game quicker.\n\nat the same time, who knows how this other person got a hold of your login credentials. For all Riot knows you could have been easily dupped into one of those free RP scams and entered your info there and that's how someone else would have gotten a hold of it, in which case that would have been entirely your fault. But that's the thing, they don't know. All they know is an account has been compromised and they'll try to do what they need to in order to set it right.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
