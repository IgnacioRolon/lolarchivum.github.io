Not only that but around 75% of my friends have reported the same problem, internet goes down only for league and the rest remains working. I have friends with leaver busters, and some others who are afraid to get banned due to this.\r\n\r\nI highly doubt that my friends and I suddenly got terrible net all at the same time. At least try to look into this problem, its been going on for a week and rioters keep giving the same response (which i already doubtfully tried, to no avail).\r\n\r\nI have friends that have simply stopped playing until this problem is fixed...\r\n\r\n{{sticker:zombie-nunu-bummed}}","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-15T17:13:50.101+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That lag spike is really high, and if it's sudden then it could be packet loss or how your ISP is routing to us.

It does look like you're getting some packet loss, and your ping starts to increase as soon as your router tries to reach your ISP.  It gets pretty worse from there, as your ISP seems to be getting some hiccups.  \n\nLet's start off with the steps in the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to help tune up your local settings for a smooth transition to your ISP.  This will help rule out any possibilities that your initial transition might be contributing to that packet loss.  Go over each step, test a custom game, and run traceroute again to see if things improve.\n\nIf the issue persists, hit us up in a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) with those logs so our tech team can work with you directly and get this resolved.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
