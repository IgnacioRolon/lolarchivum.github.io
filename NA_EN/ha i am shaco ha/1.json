Garbage base damage, bad scalings and it's physical damage, since armour is easier to buy than magic resist it makes his E even worse","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"LightningShado","date":"2018-11-20T00:51:42.280+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Kelg,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=FgoYGh1y,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2018-11-19T21:45:56.243+0000)\n>\n> i dont get it\n\nMe neither.
