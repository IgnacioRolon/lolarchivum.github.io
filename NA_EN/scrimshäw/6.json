Even with the \"The following skins will be released at various times during patch 5.7:\" part of the patch notes all we know is that they are to be released sometime between now and 5.8 (which based on your current trend this season is 2 weeks). A small delay can build up hype for a product, but delaying too long with what equates to a less nebulous \"Soon (tm)\" to tide customers over can kill interest pretty quickly.\n\nWith that, thank you for both being so open with your communication to us the fans (even if it's just to say you're just as in the dark or can't say anything) as well as being a go between to the to the other departments. I doubt it's in your job description to be a fan liaison to all the departments, but it is most definitely appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-04-09T17:23:55.844+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey A Shiny Psyduck (oooh, shiny!),\n\nI can agree that waiting too long can make the hype train die down, and that's not our intent. \n\nPlayers really wanted to know what patch their favorite skin was going to be coming out in, and we felt that adding them to the patch notes was a good way to get the message out - especially since content on PBE can be on for more than a cycle, and that's where confusion begins. This helped solve a lot of the transparency issues in regards to when x skin is going to be released (or at least narrows it down to ~2 weeks.)\n\nGenerally speaking, we have dates locked down for release, especially when tied to an event, but we don't announce those dates until we're about ready to roll them out. \n\n**Rito why?** If something isn't ready by this day (promotion wise) or we discover a bug (on a skin or elsewhere), and we have to delay the event, but players were already given a date, it can be a really crappy feeling to get your hopes up, only for us to delay the promotion/event.\n\nWe don't want to make promises we can't keep. Sure, we know a skin is ready and will be in a patch, cool - let's tell everyone, get it on the patch notes! Dates are a bit more dangerous since there's a lot of work that happens behind the scenes to make promos/events/etc. come off without a hitch. Sometimes, that's due to having an extra production day behind the scenes. :]\n\nI'd be happy to pass this along and thanks for taking the time to leave your feedback! ^-^","replies":[{"poster":"Bandle City Bot","date":"2015-04-09T18:12:22.446+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I get where you're coming from both with the thought process of announcing \"Hey you guys, we're releasing X in this patch, but not at launch\" and how it does give a sort of transparency of 'when' by narrowing down the window. This I can safely say everyone is happy about as it is infinitely better than just 'Soon (tm)'.\n\nAlso I hate to be 'that guy' who seems to be picking a fight but...\nYou bring up the good point on how crappy it feels to have a delay happen for these events. \nHowever if when said flaw/bug happens and a delay is expected if that is communicated to the fanbase it is quickly forgiven, we might not be happy, but clear communication tells us what happened. \nAt which point you're no different than a baseball game getting rained out (the players nor the stadium PLANNED for it to be rained out, but it happened and they are shifting the event to another day.)\n\n\"Hey guys, instead of the new Teemo skin being Released April 15th (example, not trying to put words in anyone's mouth) in conjunction with the Teemo Kills The World Event (also another example) we found a visual bug upon 5.7 going live that we need to fix before we feel comfortable releasing it in this patch.\"\n--Riot Whoever XX:XX Time Y Day Z Month\n\nManaging expectations does wonders and if done in a timely fashion forgives quite a bit.\nUsing the example above, telling us at 11:50pm April 14th is a nontimely fashion. Telling us April 10th, about an hour after discovering the bug confirmed to be a bug, would be timely.\n\n\nGranted if you're just answering how you've been instructed to (party line, scripts, limits in what you can tell via contract/NDA/instructions by higher ups) disregard this entirely.\nThanks again.\n\nThis is A Shiny Psyduck (oddly enough they're Golduck Blue) Signing off.\n\n\nEdit: Irony of Ironies; after posting this and checking the store, Teemo has arrived.\nEdit: Edit: If you cannot address the above (which is totally cool, I've said my piece on it and somebody at Rito knows); is the Icon supposed to auto unlock after buying the Skin or is it an object purchased apart. If it's supposed to be bundled I would like to report mine did not unlock upon purchasing the skin. If it is not, well YAY TEEMO SKIN anyways.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-04-09T18:39:27.726+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"We have a pretty free reign of what we can say, and this is me personally speaking, not as a drone. ^-^ \n\nYou bring up a really good baseball analogy. I think this definitely deserves discussion because you're right - there's a right and a wrong way to go about it, and being timely and honest has some huge win advantages. \n\nThe icon and the skin are separate, so it's working as intended if you didn't receive the icon upon purchasing the skin. Generally speaking, icons associated with skins only unlock for ultimate skins. \n\nAlso, +1 to YAY TEEMO!","replies":[{"poster":"Flemman","date":"2015-04-09T19:29:46.067+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"now that teemo is out, can we talk about the icon you will do for the next poolparty event? :p\n\nI personnaly want a scruttlecrab rubber ring :D","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"EnvyDragon","date":"2015-04-08T23:08:11.164+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just out of curiosity, why is it that skins tend to have a different release schedule from patches?
