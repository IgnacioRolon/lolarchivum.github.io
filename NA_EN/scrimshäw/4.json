I'm sure the color choice has to do with Vi's normal hair color, but pink really isn't a a traditionally \"demonic\" color like red or orange (think Coop's devils as an example).  It's going to look like a tiny pink \"Sionball\" when she Q's or R's towards me.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CHOPSTICKUHH","date":"2015-09-30T17:35:49.268+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Like wings on dragon slayer pantheons R","replies":[]},{"poster":"Noctius28","date":"2015-09-30T21:18:11.450+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"dude we just want the tail 24/7, the wings is perfectly understandable but whynot have the tail always visible?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Scrimshäw","date":"2015-09-30T18:38:31.184+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":5,"body":"the wings i get, the tail i don't. i mean, is a tail really going to be so distracting? it even makes more sense for the wings to only show up when ulting, and the tail to always be out,\n\nwings= help with speed and forward thrust\n\ntails= help with stabilization and walking\n\n???\n\nprofit\n\n\n\nps: that's all i'm saying now, i know riot doesn't actually change skins other than maybe fixing some color issues based on feedback, so gg.","replies":[{"poster":"Zedex","date":"2015-10-01T01:45:00.650+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They do change skins when there is positive feedback and positive discussions.

Where he toggles the hood? Granted here we are talking about two different parts of the body.... But could you guys do it? I know the wings are cool, and nice. But, whenever you think Demon/Devil...
