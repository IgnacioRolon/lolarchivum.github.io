Look at my most played champions, I know ALL about these matchups and builds of mid laners, especially those on Zed. Mercurial rush is NOT better than a Maw rush, it's a terrible buy. That is a 3rd item or MAYBE a second item, if you NEED it.\n\nRoA is good because it makes you scale way too hard, gives you 120 AP at max stacks, and gives you a TON of HP, giving you enough to survive assassin burst unless they're greatly ahead of you. You don't see Rylias rush unless it's on someone abusable like Brand, you don't see Liandrys rush because it needs more AP for synergizing. You have just as many options. How about we say how Zed's only summoner spell option is ignite and flash if he ever wants kill pressure on a mage? Meanwhile you get barrier/heal/exhaust/ignite depending who you are. Take exhaust next time you go against Zed as Lissandra.\n\nYou all blow this out of proportion. An example is when everyone thought duskblade was going to be broken while I said it wasn't, and I SAID why it wasn't going to be, and go figure, nobody agreed. Look where we are now.

Efficiency values of AD items are inherently more valuable for obvious reasons such as the fact that THEY APPLY TO AUTO ATTACKS and AD champs have higher ratios, sustain, etc. ADC items are more along the lines of the same efficiency values, BUT THEY MULTIPLY rapidly increasing their values when they go from 1 to 2 to 3 items. Mage items don't. Non ADC AD items are straight up more efficient than AP items.\n\nIt's incredibly disturbing that Xypherous is so completely dead set on using this new idea for what efficiency is right despite all the the data showing the contrary. Mages can NOT touch any tank, are outclassed early and mid game by AD counterparts, and fall off like a rock late game if it ever reaches that.\n\nI'd honestly pay to see you guys spend 100 games in ranked playing mages, you would give up all hope on the class.\n\n1000G doesn't come near enough to make them competitive vs any class late game, and doesn't address the fact of how weak they are relatively in both the mid and early game. If they're not comparable to other classes, early, mid or late game anymore, what's the reasoning behind that? The only reason they're even picked anymore is for mixed damage, which is why Corki/Ezreal are so popular mid in pro games.\n\nTanks? 1000G worth of stats more will still mean with a single Banshee's the tank can ignore mages and go for whatever target.\n\nADCs? They'll still kill mages late game with 3 near guaranteed crits and the state of the game now, especially with the upcoming mage nerfs, makes it incredibly difficult to ever 100-0 one.

These are some of the kinds of things I'm pretty interested in making sure we've thought out.\n\nFor one, Graves can burst out a Syndra before she can properly set up more than one or two spheres for her combo. \n\nADC itemisation is superior to mage itemisation. You can think about ADC items: do I want to be an AD caster? Essence Reaver. Do I want poke? Rapidfire. Do I want AoE? Shiv. Do I need to duel? Phantom Dancer. Am I dying quickly? Guardian's Angel or Bloodthirster. Do I need MORE AoE? Runaan's. Just more damage? Infinity Edge. Are they stacking armour and HP? Lord Dominik. Armour, but a lot of sustain? Mortal Reminder.\n\nWhat do AP mages have to think about? We must get Zhonya, because it's the only AP item that gives us some defence against being bursted down, both by its Active and due to having Armour. We have to buy Rabadon's Deathcap, because there's no other strong multiplier for AP. We need either Morellonomicon, Rod of Ages or Athene's Unholy Grail to provide us with enough Mana (Regen) to get around our greatest weakness:\n\n*Every AP Mana champion's weakness is their total and utter reliance on casting spells, while being limited by a resource they can't easily recover.*\n\nAn ADC like Varus can opt into Essence Reaver to solve Mana issues, because some AAs will definitely get him back the Mana he needs to sustain his spellcasting pattern.\n\nAn AP champion like Syndra has no such options, besides increasing her passive mana regen.\n\nThe current proposed changes to mage itemisation suggests that AP champions aren't hampered by resources enough and *emphasises a weakness*, namely the complete and utter reliance mages have on Mana. As if that isn't bad enough, we also get a slap to the face and insult to injury by lowering AP values for some of these items, meaning **new itemisation looks to emphasise a weakness without adding strength**, and it implies mages as a whole are currently considered unhealthy. In a game where you can be deleted for 60 seconds within 1 second.\n\nWhere before, Syndra and Veigar could decide between Morellonomicon and Athene's Unholy Grail depending on whether they wanted to fight long fights or burst someone down, the new itemisation changes are telling us we don't need to think about what items to buy; we buy Morellonomicon, because we don't deserve to have another option in that slot.\n\nThese changes hurt Mages, because our agency of selecting an item build is being shoehorned into a specific direction by removing options and worsening items that were used for specific cases. Zhonya's is made worse so that we can be allowed to buy it sooner, but it means we'll be giving up our lategame power... again. Someone like Zed has the fullest agency to build damage with every item he buys, but we're getting nerfed on the AP for defensive items we buy, resulting in a loss of damaging ability *without a gain in defensive strength*. \n\nI truly, truly want to like the changes, but in the thread there is talk about unhealthy gameplay and how \"infinite poke\" isn't healthy... but meanwhile, things like Zed *do* get infinite poke.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Xonra","date":"2016-04-08T07:10:20.718+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RiotRepertoir,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=VVoFcWc0,comment-id=000b00010000,timestamp=2016-04-07T21:41:05.332+0000)\n>\n> Please do elaborate. These are some of the kinds of things I'm pretty interested in making sure we've thought out.\n\nIm not sure which part specifically you were wanting elaborated but Ill start with the marskman part specifically. \n\nRight now the itemization for marskman is quite possibly the most balanced itemization for any class or role. You have itemization for mr, cc, burst, tankiness, crit, cdr, the list goes on. That alone gives them a huge advantage, and with the marksman update making so many more viable and unique, they easily transitioned into other roles.\n\n Graves for example can clear the jungle faster than most mage junglers, as well as ganking on par, and scaling far better and with a variety of options. In top he can be a bully immediately where no mages can outside of cheesey matchups now and then. \n\nVarus and Corki mid bring the poke and scaling that even most mages dont have access to, and rival in burst with corki at least. \n\nWith the changes as they stand, itemization seems to be focused hard on utility more than burst or even sustained damage. Spell vamp is being understandably removed, and the one direct counter a mage has to assassins is being nerfed essentially, to put cdr on what I feel is the wrong item to add cdr to for the tradeoffs. \n\nThe marksman update gave a lot of marksman tools in the way of survivability and direct damage. The mage update seems to be removing burst and ap in general, and in some cases mana regen, in favor of utility, in some some cases in awkward ways (hextech belt for example). \n\nGames are shorter, towers fall easier, dragon fights are much less often, and due to this the bursty and cc heavy mages are being used less in favor of marksman who can take towers fast in early tower trading and fast objective trading. Removing damage and any mana regen from mages is only going to give auto attack reliant and resourcless or manaless champions an even greater advantage.\n\nIf you have a corki vs an ahri for example, the ahri will be out pushed because this update will cause her to go oom and mage auto attacks simply dont match up. The corki could easily push against her and even roam easily now. There are lots of examples, but right now marksman are class A and some mages can keep up in certain phases. With the changes, mages will be outdamaged further, and the added cdr coupled with the lower mana regen will only serve to cause them to go oom faster, and the lower ap values will hurt not only in fights, but with objectives (directly less turret damage for example due to leas auto attack to turret ap damage compared to the speed of the already currently popular double marksman comps).\n\nHope I explained that decently, as Im attempting this on my phone.
