I had a game last night where a pink ward was placed in a bush. The enemy put a ward in that bush, and it disappeared after 5 seconds and never reappeared, although it did with sweeper. It still distributed the gold between me and the pink owner, however... Pink ward isn't working 100% as intended.","replies":[{"poster":"KR LEE S1N","date":"2015-12-09T01:34:04.344+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"YES, i found it with a sweeper as well, they definitely need to fix this bug though, it seems as if they aren't aware of it even.
