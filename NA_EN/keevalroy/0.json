They're not even trying to hide the fact that they play favorites, then spit in our faces when we call them on it by nerfing other champions that didn't have a problem in the fist place.  Do you think the Lee Sin nerf threads are funny or something?  Do you honestly think an attack speed touch to Zed is a reasonable nerf?  Did you not see how many people were opposed to the Sona and Ahri nerfs?\n\nOr is it that you just don't give a damn?  Seems like that's the most reasonable conclusion since you can't seem to understand what you're doing to the game. I watched that patch rundown and it made me sick hearing that you apparently want diversity in the game.  Alright, so removing DFG and not compensating the champions affected by it is a brilliant idea right?   Removing the item and slowly filling the holes left by it afterwards is great for retaining those off-builds.\n\nThe jungle is garbage, and you're making it worse.  I don't understand why you insist that increasing the cost of the upgraded smite is a good thing. A lot of junglers are already struggling to get through the first clear, so why make it even harder? You just want Lee Sin to be stronger don't you?  No, there's no tinfoil hat this time, we know you want to see Lee every game.  Want to disagree?  Then explain how he hasn't been nerfed yet - or do you need to nerf Sona again to compensate for his incoming 7.45 / 7.40 health regen nerf.\n\nNone of that matters in the LCS, your balance team's favorite thing to watch, does it?  From watching so many LCS matches, they've grown to love certain champions from watching their flashy, fun, and exciting plays, such as Lee Sin's.  That would explain why he's never going to be nerfed - you guys like him way too much and want to see him succeed.  But wait, there's ANOTHER champion in contention for the Favorite Child title.  You have acknowledged that Zed is a champion who *might* be an issue for mid laners, and have stated that you do in fact like watching his plays...so you nerf his attack speed and call it a day...what the fuck?\n\nWas the reasoning behind killing Ahri's role as an assassin actually that she could fight Zed?  Huh, if Zed get's charmed, he could die from that burst, so let's make it so that getting hit with charm is only a minor inconvenience at the hefty cost of mana - yes, she has to use resources to do damage, Zed doesn't.  I just wanted to explain that last part since I'm convinced some of you don't actually play the game, otherwise the balance changes would make some amount of sense wouldn't they?\n\nChanges that you keep shoving out have been discussed in great detail over many threads about similar topics, yet all of them seem to be ignored.  What is the point of PBE if our feedback on balance is worthless?  Why should we even try to talk to you if you're just going to brick-wall us and say (behind your computer screens because typing it would be bad for business) : \"It's our game, deal with it.  If you don't like it, you don't have to play.\"  Again, want to disagree?  Prove me wrong.  Talk to us, let's come up with some compromises to some of these 'experimental' changes that make it to the live servers regardless of feedback. And what I mean by talk to us doesn't mean hiding on reddit since most of the posters can't actually prove they've played a single game of League in their life. On here, you can actually see their account.\n\nIf you can't do that, if you can't perform the simplest of solutions to break down the wall between Riot and community by talking to us, then you've failed as designers. Balance feedback is meant to be expressed and debated.  It was for a little while, then you guys kinda disappeared after stating \"Sorry, we'll do better at communicating.\"  You hate being called liars, but I've seen that excuse, and that action enough times that it's lost meaning to me.  YOU need to be the ones to talk as well.  Don't make Kateykhaos walk through a minefield explaining that she isn't in charge of balance but she believes X is for Y reason.  Don't make Rioters who's job isn't about the topic be the one to communicate.  The thought is appreciated, but it's not solving anything.\n\nEdit:  Why are people still commenting on this?  This was posted over 4 months ago.  Everything but my criticisms are out of date.\n\nEdit 2:  Okay, it's over 6 months later, stop commenting.  Yes the balance team is still untrustworthy and will probably _always_ be a constant source of disappointment and anger to the community.  We don't need to keep bringing it up here.  Make another thread.  And yes I still stand by my original point - you need to clear out your balance team and sub in people who_ aren't_ a bunch of lying hypocrites or condescending egomaniacs that actually give a shit about the players instead of how League looks for spectators.\n\nEdit 3:  Almost 10 months later, I'm still waiting for these lying egomaniacs to be replaced.  They're continuing to feign interest in the community with these little PR driven Q&amp;A posts before they go back into hiding, ignoring questions about their favoritism and lying where they don't want to admit their intentions, and dismissing concerns over their blatant hypocrisy.  But what do I know, I'm just a \"conspiracy theorist.\" Right?\n","replies":[{"poster":"Retillin","date":"2015-01-28T21:11:50.037+0000","up_votes":191,"down_votes":7,"body":"Every single line you wrote is combative and comes across as very rough to say the least. However you are 100% correct. \n\nRiot Phreak tried (I guess you would call it try) to back up the idea that Riot is working on champion diversity (especially in the LCS). His main point was that the picks that are not being nerfed by Riot was that they were not top picks. Because the champions that pro players pick \"just the most fun\". So he said the only reason we see Lee Sin, Thresh, Zed is because the pro players enjoy playing them more than anyone else. Granted this is just a page or two after his reasoning for their nerfs on mid Janna last year. \n\n\"They played mid Janna because she was bullshit. They played mid Soraka because she was bullshit. Pros really like to pick champions that are un-counterable. Their opponents are, just like them, extremely skilled League of Legends players. If you can find a champion that CANNOT be outplayed, that's a really strong champion to play in top tier play.\"\n\nThis was words, and they he followed it up talking about those that are thought of as \"favourite children\" of Riot's are just more fun and that is why pros pick them.\n\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/esports/aYUEYaY2-almost-everyone-wants-to-see-champion-diversity-in-lcs\n\n\nBut the main issue is, Riot DOESN'T want diversity if it means their favourite are not at the top of the pile for the most played. At this point I don't know how much posts like this matter. Riot has, for whatever reason, walked away from the forums. Unless they feel like being condescending and flip flopping to try and back up their ideas and plans. \n\nIf they just came out and said, \"we are not going to nerf Lee Sin because we believe he leads to a higher viewership and a growth of the game\" I would not be happy but at least, they would be honest.\n\nedit: I would like to say I am glad there are Rioters that come and TRY to help players to understand such as KateyKhaos and others.

The pro players do this for MONEY; they pick what wins games.   Any average moron could see that.  Plenty of \"fun\" champions don't see LCS play; we see them once in a blue moon, in games that don't matter for the standings.  And we often see them hovered over as a pick right before they switch to their REAL pick.  Now, is there sometimes a correlation between overloaded kits, in game success, and fun?  Yes.  Winning is fun.  That's pretty much it.\n\nThe problem is that they SAY they want diversity, and are doing everything possible to weaken diversity.  The jungle changes hurt weaker junglers without touching the stronger ones.  The utter LACK of nerfs to Zed continues to crowd out immobile mana-dependent mages in mid.

Do we balance for LCS or for Silver players? Or both? We're trying to make sure we agree on what our actual goal is, because I think \"We balance for everyone!\" is a little too precious and unrealistic. We'll communicate our strategy when we've made sure we're on the same page. Balance philosophy is a topic that greatly interests me. I don't make the individual tuning changes personally (and you wouldn't want me to) so I can't provide as much context on specific patch notes, though I do help set the philosophy and direction for what kinds of changes we try to make.\n\nRelated, \"win rate\" gets used a lot as synonymous with balance, but that doesn't tell the whole story. We need to communicate better about what game balance means to us, because there's more to it than that. A lot of what you're discussing in this thread is sort of \"pre-balancing.\" We're making a change (that we have wanted to make for some time!) by removing DFG, and we know that change would have big ramifications if we didn't adjust some champs to compensate. Those adjustments, while grounded in math, playtesting and player feedback, still often come down to educated guesses, because we don't have the data from thousands of live games yet. A more accurate but painfully slow way to balance is to make one change, see how the live game reacts, then make another change in response to that. We think this would feel worse overall.\n\nOn design accountability -- it totally exists. It's part of my job to make sure it exists. Now, it's not the kind of thing you're likely to see a lot. We're not going to publicly flog designers for making mistakes, though I can understand why that might be cathartic. On the other hand, designers (and anyone at Riot really) should be upfront and honest with you guys about when they think they've made a mistake.\n\nOn designers buffing champions that they like to play -- this would be a big accountability issue. As someone pointed out, while we are all gamers here, this is also a place of business with a product (LoL) and customers (you guys). It's royally unprofessional to try and tweak the game to benefit your own personal games. That's a serious breach of trust (Rioter and players) that would come with serious consequences. We may make changes you don't understand or don't agree with, but it's not because we're trying to boost our own ELO.\n\nOn Lee and Thresh -- they are champions we like, but more importantly, they also resonate with a lot of players. It's not a popularity contest, but on the other hand, we believe a lot of why people play them is because they are fun to play, not just because they win a lot. Both champs have a lot of cool abilities, and arguably they both have so many that a) neither has a lot of weaknesses, and b) they compliment almost any comp you try to build. We're trying to figure out ways to make them less awesome in every situation without stripping away what is fun about them. For example, last year or so we tried to tone down Lee's mobility and ward hopping, but it felt terrible, and largely due to player feedback (intelligent, meaningful feedback, not whining and pitchforks) we reverted it.\n\nAs always, we appreciate the feedback. The more targeted and actionable it is, the more useful it is for us. I can go tell the balance team \"Boards say you suck\" and they would kind of look at me and say \"Okay, what changes in how we adjust champions should we make?\" and I would say \"You just suck.\" There's not really a lot of direction for improvement there.\n\nHugs,\nGC","replies":[{"poster":"Keevalroy","date":"2015-01-29T20:14:19.984+0000","up_votes":92,"down_votes":13,"body":"Thank you for coming to this thread, and I understand what you're saying, but it doesn't change the fact that the balance patches have been getting worse with each update with more and more negative feedback.

You've noted that certain champions are loaded and don't have a lot of weaknesses that can also fit with any team comp and be effective against any strategy, but that doesn't explain why they haven't been nerfed after such a period of being relevant.  \n\nAlthough you may disagree, we see this as the balance team playing favorites, especially when you do things like what you did you Ahri: utterly destroying her assassin role and forcing her into a mage category despite the feedback asking you not to go through with the changes or to alter them.  Zed gets off scot-free because the attack speed nerf isn't a nerf at all, and Sona continues to be nerfed for whatever reason you guys can manufacture at the time.  \n\nThese examples among other questionable decisions have led us to question why it is you prioritize changes that don't need to happen while glaring problems in the game go unattended to.  Is it because of favoritism?  Is it because of blind optimism that the community will respond well?  Or the third and most questioned since our feedback here, **as well as on the PBE forums** don't seem to matter; do you even care?\n---\nEdit: Also, I don't see how this thread is anything close to a \"boards says you suck\" thread.  There lists upon lists of issues we've been seeing in the recent patches that have been expressed throughout this thread.  If you want a more direct demand for the balance team, get them in here so they can do the following:\n\n- Apologize for and admit they are playing favorites.\n- Admit they value and balance to the pro-scene over the rest of us.\n- Tell us that our feedback on champion balance is meaningless if it goes against their grand design.\n\nOnce this has happened, we won't be happy about it, but we'll be happy we see the honesty. From there, we can hopefully work together to make League a better game for the future because let's be real, it's crap right now.\n\nYes, we can work together, it can actually happen.  Let us bounce some ideas off you guys and you can bounce some back on us.  We can each weigh in on what we like or don't like about changes to see if compromises can be made.  I thought Boards was designed to be for easier communication, why not make that a reality?  Stop going to reddit, and join us on here so we can have a meaningful discussion **on League's own forums** rather than a third party platform.

You (Riot) literally forced everyone into Ahri's assassin mode.  Are you having selective memory loss again? Remember when you nerfed Ahri's mage build and gutted her ratios (again) then gave her that damage amplification? The Ahri mage community told you that it forced her into **an assassin**.  What do you want Ahri to be? The balance team flip flops so much that it isn't funny anymore its sad. Is Ahri an assassin or a mage? \n\nThis isn't the only issue. The community also voiced concerns about Lucian and Graves occupying the same role and function and how nerfing/buffing one effects the other. Instead of giving Lucian a more defined role you nerfed him and his itemization.  He used to be able to go into different openings (TF into BT) (BT into GhostBlade) (BT into IE) but now you have forced him towards a critical hit path. Not only that the whole problem with ADCs rushing BT can now be replaced with ADCs rushing IE. Every. Single. Game. It's almost as if the balance team is playing whack a mole balancing.

Just how long were you planning on driving without knowing what the destination was?\n\nIn my view, the correct destination is optimal balance for optimal play.  If you can help low level play be more balanced without negatively affecting optimal play cases, that's great and please do, but don't make changes to improve the low level play experience at the expense of high level play.\n\n> A more accurate but painfully slow way to balance is to make one change, see how the live game reacts, then make another change in response to that. We think this would feel worse overall.\n\nCorrect.  I think we have more complaint about the targets of balance actions than what balance actions you actually take.\n\nFor example, we're super confused why Sona keeps getting nerfs despite seeing little competitive play and being only a slightly winning, relatively unpopular champion in solo queue.  Meanwhile, Jarvan is ruining everyone everywhere, not even a mention.  I happen to think the nerfs you picked for Sona are pretty healthy, I just don't get why she's the target.  She's not even close to the best support right now.\n\n> As always, we appreciate the feedback. The more targeted and actionable it is, the more useful it is for us. I can go tell the balance team \"Boards say you suck\" and they would kind of look at me and say \"Okay, what changes in how we adjust champions should we make?\" and I would say \"You just suck.\" There's not really a lot of direction for improvement there.\n\nConcrete things to work on:\n\n1. Figure out what you're going to do with **collateral damage** -- when changes targeted at some part of the game affect another, what is your plan?   Probably the best example here is when mid Lulu required nerfs, and the original message was \"we'll make sure this doesn't make support Lulu suck\", but then you totally made support Lulu suck and she still does.  I find your response to collateral damage inconsistent and poorly communicated; you often contradict previous statements in newer ones, and actions taken in case X are radically different than in case Y.\n2. **Champion purgatory** is what I call the thing where strong champions are deemed unhealthy and left deliberately undertuned.  Past examples include Olaf, Diana, and Alistar.  I'd like more clarity on who's there, why they're there, and what you intend to do about it.  I see absolutely no reason why champions should be in purgatory for years at a time with near zero communication, and it's depressingly common.\n3. **Rework communication** is awful.  Designers show up in one thread, disappear for a month or two, and come back with changes that may or may not have anything to do with what was communicated previously.  When communication does occur, I parse it as very defensive; rework designers often come across as having an \"I'm right and here's why\" sort of attitude.  I think reworks will always be uncomfortable for dedicated players of a champion, but there is also a lot of value being missed in spotty, low-quality communication today.  Why not have a weekly thread on any champion that's currently being actively reworked?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Guy Fox Teemo","date":"2015-01-30T06:56:04.992+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yes because every post that says riot is doing a bad job doesn't ever state why they are and how to fix it.

You see, as non-employees, we can't see what is going on in Riot, there is a *wall* between us (the ones who play the game) and and the designers (the ones who make the game). So when there is something that we don't like about the game, it can often feel like we are yelling at a *wall* trying to say something (which is probably why some of the boards are a bit rudely-put).\n\nTo put what I'm trying to say in perspective, I'll give an example. So I know that Sashtu has been having a hard time with his Cass rework, and I can understand why (it's basically a wall of criticism on the boards). But I think the biggest problem is that people felt like no one was listening with their \"@Sashtu, so about Cass rework\" threads. I think if Sashtu had come out to us and said \"hey, I know that not everyone is going to like this Cass rework, but I think my changes were necessary because [insert reasons]. I would like to hear how the Cass rework could have been done better, or how it can be improved. Thanks.\" You know, then suddenly it opens up dialogue between the player and the developer. It puts a window in that 'wall' that I mentioned, that allows each side to see what the other is up to, let's us 'peek in' at riot, let's us feel left out, you know?\n\nI hope you do,\nToben","replies":[{"poster":"Ghostcrawler","date":"2015-01-31T00:14:56.085+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":14,"body":"> You know, then suddenly it opens up dialogue between the player and the developer.

It can be tricky in practice because if you say \"Please tell me how it can be improved,\" and two players have totally different ideas or one player has a really nutty idea, they then are disappointed when you don't implement exactly what they describe and feel like you aren't listening to them.\n\nPut in other words, the way it should work is that we listen to a lot of feedback and use that to inform the decisions we use on the champ update (in this case, though it applies to any design work). But it's easy for players to hear \"I am going to do exactly what you say,\" which of course often isn't the case for a variety of reasons.\n\nWe can do better though.

Below, if I say \"you\" I mean Riot in general.  And of course, what follows is just what I feel; I am not in your design meetings.\n\nRiot definitively plays favorites.  You place a certain value on skill shots, and allow champions with skill shots to be much more powerful than champions without skill shots.  You hate point-and-click stuns (they have been removed in every single rework I can think of).  When a non-skill shot champion becomes powerful/popular you immediately nerf them.  Two that come to mind are Taric when he was being played top and Warwick at the start of the pre-season.  They were nerfed the next patch.  Meanwhile, we went all season 4 without Lee Sin, Elise or Kha being brought back into line.  You use terms like \"you like champions where you can express your skills\".   You value mechanical skill much more than intelligence or strategy.\n\nThe downside of this is that you have made a game that is highly dependent on reaction time.  It isn't a shock that all the LCS players are teenagers and young 20-somethings.  Furthermore, since your game is all based on reaction time, it is likewise sensitive to lag.  Again, no shock that all the NA LCS players move to the west coast.  Case in point, I am as far east as you can get.  I was playing Morgana the other night and the enemy team has Karthus.  He ulted, I threw on Black Shield and his ult went through prior to the shield going up.  I was lagging that badly!  So what do you balance for, a 20 year old professional gamer living next to your servers, or an (ahem) older person that plays once or twice after working all day and has  200-1200 ms lag?\n\nI play champions that I know I have a chance to use effectively with my reflexes and lag.  I don't want the Warwick rework, where you have a skillshot jump, that you have to hit E during your jump to fear your enemies.  However, I also dislike where he is now; he feels gutted.  I don't play LeBlanc mid for a similar reason, I don't want to have to mash 4 buttons in a millisecond while targeting an enemy champion.  I want champions where intelligence, map awareness and strategy all matter (figures I'd main supports and jungle).  But you seem to keep pushing us towards more and more skill shot champions.\n\nOne last thing about Thresh....his kit seems overloaded.  A 1.5 second stun at first level, where the cooldown is reduced my 3 seconds for each basic attack?  A ranged basic attack at that?  And his lantern... it used to have some counter play, but you removed that.  Pretty much invalidates J4's ult, and allows immobile champions a 1500-unit dash.  So a stun, a shield, a free dash for allies, two slows...and is tanky.  You can see why people like him!","replies":[{"poster":"Ghostcrawler","date":"2015-01-30T22:29:23.928+0000","up_votes":22,"down_votes":43,"body":"> Riot definitively plays favorites.

Good champions have elements like counterplay and a never-ending path to mastery, and skill shots are one of the most common ways we try to deliver on the never-ending path to mastery part. It's not the only way. Champions with little counterplay or bring with them a ton of frustration aren't ones we want to see players playing a ton... in their current state. They just erode the health and fun of the game. Frequently these champions do have some cool aspects to them, even if it's just their thematic, but overall they really need a full update. It's not that we hate them, but that we recognize they need some love.","replies":[{"poster":"Keevalroy","date":"2015-01-30T22:46:19.848+0000","up_votes":25,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Ghostcrawler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Koqpn4ob,comment-id=003b00370000,timestamp=2015-01-30T22:29:23.928+0000)\n>\n> We don't play favorites in the sense that if someone on the Live team really loves to play Singed that he or she makes sure Singed always gets tons of love.\n\nOnly that IS what's happening.

What are your concerns?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ghostcrawler","date":"2015-02-07T00:13:07.292+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":15,"body":"> This brings us back to the very core of our complaints. It's what YOU want, not US, not the community playing with and against the game pieces you're modifying. We've been very vocal, and the negativity you associate with us stems from the way that no matter how much noise we make about changes not being optimal for the game's health, said changes go through anyway.\n\nWe rarely see that level of consensus in the community... for anything. Usually there is a strong contingent that feels one way and can't understand why we don't agree with them, and another contingent that feels exactly the opposite and can't understand why we don't get their point of view. This job would be easy if you could just ask players what to do and be confident with that direction.\n\nPlease don't misinterpret that as \"players never agree so they are useless as a resource.\" Far from it. But the conversation is a nuanced one, not just \"Do what we say and your game will be awesome.\"","replies":[]}]}
