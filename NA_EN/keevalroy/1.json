What about that ridiculous movement speed buff she gets from firing off her Q?  Seriously, why does she have this?  As someone who has been opposed to this compensation buff since the beginning, I still don&#039;t understand why this unnecessary and random buff was tacked onto her kit other than to make her look more flashy.  The Q speed does. Not. Make. Sense.  \n\nWhat do people complain about the most when they talk about Ahri?  I mostly see complaints about mobility, yet that isn&#039;t what&#039;s being addressed.  \nNow I see that her Charm can&#039;t stop dashes anymore...yes, because how dare the player time their skillshots to hit you as you dash forward rewarding them for reacting fast enough...  All the while, she&#039;s still running around the mid lane like a Kenyan senselessly throwing out random orbs to run away from ganks.  _That_ is the real issue.\n\n\nThe kiss of death mechanic was arguably the best thing that ever happened to her since it matched her theme perfectly and rewarded people for being good with her.  Why not get rid of the movespeed she has for no reason, and give back the percent damage amp on her charm?  DFG isn&#039;t in the game anymore, and  the double amplification is gone - reward the player for hitting their skillshots and punish them for mindless spamming. \n\nWill this change be an automatic fix?  Of course not, her kit would still need to be adjusted, but extraneous mobility is what Riot should be looking at first and foremost, not the utility of well-timed skillshots.","replies":[{"poster":"Charmed by Ahri","date":"2016-02-16T21:19:08.473+0000","up_votes":43,"down_votes":11,"body":"So riot doesn't want to see Ahri killing people with WR so they lower the range of both spells to make it harder for her to get off raw damage because they want to see how well Ahri can land her skillshot right? But when Ahri does so they Increase the mana cost of Q to see her land her other. So Ahri focuses on hitting E all the while inturrpting people by landing it, then riot goes about nerfing the ability charm has to inturrpt various ults and now dashes. It's as if riot doesn't want Ahri to play for her skillshots. It's pretty unsettling as a main. No DFG, No compensation, No Charm amp, Lower WR ranges, Q mama cost up, passive heal nerfed and now Charm doesn't inturrpt certain abilities. Like it or not Ahri is another champion amongst 100s of champions and she just gets nerf after Nerf no matter how you play her. Honestly It's a bunch of bs, when it comes to patch note changes Ahri single handedly has the highest changes out of every champion in the game. Sad. When so many other champions who sit at the top of Winrate's who's kit is absolutely broken and have not even a comparable patch note history like Ahri does. So many champions who need balance but all the community and riot focus on is nerfing Ahri. And yet half the league champions still run rampant in terms that they are no where near balanced and are over powered but go unnoticed because??","replies":[{"poster":"YCitizenSnipsY","date":"2016-02-17T01:15:32.339+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":2,"body":"Riot for some reason has really started to hate Ahri's charm ever since Morello left. This nerf a lot like the last one only punishes experienced Ahri players that could consistently land charm, in this case against some one mid dash. No body that doesn't play Ahri isn't even going to notice this nerf. \n\nI'm just going to take a wild stab in the dark and assume there is  a reason in season 4 when she was most charm reliant that she was never nerfed, infact she was buffed. It seems like taking everything away from charm while making the rest of her kit easy isn't exactly good for balance. In both season 3 and 5 she had to receive nerfs because of people abusing the low skill floor, something Riot seems hell bent on preserving.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Woook3r","date":"2016-02-16T20:12:10.238+0000","up_votes":22,"down_votes":1,"body":"All this does is buff the league of mobility","replies":[{"poster":"Keevalroy","date":"2016-02-16T20:16:00.742+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":0,"body":"Which is an enormous problem in and of itself.","replies":[{"poster":"Woook3r","date":"2016-02-16T20:18:05.984+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"I wouldnt say its an enourmous problem.
