I'm in the process of creating a website that helps you see **why** you are the rank you are, and where you could be. **The link is at the bottom of the post**.\n\nThere's a lot of cosmetic changes needed. This is just something I threw together (design wise) to get the prototype working.\n\nIs there anyone who is interested in seeing their stats, why they are the rank they are, what they could improve on, and how they match up against their lane opponent and a pro? See screenshot below.\n\nUpon seeing your own report, please feel free to let me know what your opinion is. From the testing I've done, the numbers seem correct. However, anything you see in your report that seems off, let me know. Anything you **don't** see and would like to see, please feel free to request it.\n\nhttp://www.uploady.com/#!/download/LJuzOwGt2qR/fA1NHL18h6T_~cKA\n\n\n\nA few things to note:\n\nThe website tries its best to detect if you're tanking or not. If it doesn't detect that you're tanking, yet you're playing the role of tank, it means you should have built more tanky.\n\nThe website will still report that you need MR/Armor when you're playing support. I'm toying with the idea of making this less essential for support as you will really only encounter other supports as your adversary. Countering them is pretty pointless armor/resist wise. Let me know what your thoughts on this are particularly, if you don't mind, please. I'd love to see what you've got to say regarding little nuances like this one.\n\n***Updates***\n\nPresently with the selective beta process, I thought it'd be a good time to bring up known bugs:\n\n~~1: Sometimes a random champion will appear as your lane adversary in a match.~~ **Resolved**\n2: Some items do not actually properly register stat-wise. If you spot an item that adds armor, for example, and it says you have not built armor, please report it.\n3: Support statistics need an overhaul. They'll be a bit inaccurate, and tips will not be entirely true.\n4: Damage taken will be a bit skewed for soak-champs like Vladamir.\n5: Some **very** unrealistic jumps are being predicted (like Silver to Challenger), especially when stats are dissected and you see your performance has been evaluated as sub-par. This is being evaluated and will be resolved in the near future. Please don't take this as anything more than a bug.\n\n\n**Please go here to test the website:  http://www.SlashLaugh.com**","replies":[{"poster":"PoopRichard","date":"2014-11-15T19:05:35.324+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Seems pretty cool so far.

It also seems to rate me randomly.\n\nExample of this is it rated my games, randomly said I was bronze (I'm not in bronze) and said if I continued my trend I would be low bronze. I was like...uh what? So I hit refresh, completely different. Same games, same graph, but below my games were suddenly rated higher, like what I stated above, and suddenly was rating me high silver (I'm currently silver 5, so nothing special).

I feel like it pushes too much influence onto k/d/a when in some roles having a meh kda is good. If I am playing a tank I should be the first one of any of my teammates dead in a team fight. I also won't be getting much kills as a tank either.\n\nIt appears to somewhat take into account a predefined role of the champion you play, when instead it should be more champion specific. For instance see my attached screen shot. I played Janna that game and it gave me marks off because Thresh had more damage taken than me. Considering Janna sits on the backline while Thresh tanks the frontline, he should definitely have taken more damage than me.\n\nSame goes for the marks it took off because Thresh dealt more damage than I did as Janna. Seriously? lol. \n\nAnother game I looked at I played Riven top and it chose my adversary as the TF mid. It then proceeded to tell me I was bronze Riven because I took more damage than TF did. Of course melee champions will take more damage than ranged.\n\nDamage taken honestly shouldn't be used / compared to your adversary's. It criticised me for having more damage taken as jungle kha zix than the enemy jungle amumu just because kha zix is considered an assasin and therefore shouldn't be tanking damage. \n\nAmumu had only 1 less death than me. If I have way more damage taken than my opponent, and yet our deaths are still comparable, it means I did a better job than him. I was able to absorb more damage than my opponent while still not dying. Deaths should absolutely matter when it comes to total damage taken.\n\nI also like this one \"Your gold earned this match was less than your adversarry's. Try farming more\" even though my cs was double my adversarry's that game. If you lost the game you are likely to have less gold than your opponent unless you really outplayed your opponent. Global gold is strong.\n\nAlso your website doesn't track jungle cs, only lane cs. This vastly skews the results for junglers.\n\nThat is all I saw at a quick glance, hope that info helps make your website better.","replies":[{"poster":"Phreaktastic","date":"2014-11-28T02:42:01.862+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It does seem like a calculation is necessary for damage taken. It's been mentioned before, namely on soak champs like Vlad. But really if you're taking high amounts of damage, it is worth taking into account that you're spending less time on the battlefield even if you don't die. Where you could see it as being an asset to the team, another could see it as being a liability. There are exceptions (such as Vlad, Trynd, Mao, etc.), but for the most part there is a reason for challenger ranked players taking the damage they do as an average. If you're compared to them and it's specific to your champion, it's not a matter of opinion per se, it's more of a matter of play style. If you're wanting to be challenger, take the advice and run with it. If you're not, then don't.\n\nGold earned is a global amount, with everything taken into consideration. Whether it means you need to farm more or not, it's there. It's calculated based on how much a pro would have earned. Again, if you think you're on your way to challenger without adopting the average pros' playstyles, don't take the advice.\n\nCS is not calculated, it's **given** to the website from Riot.\n\nYou're putting a lot of emphasis on KDA, when it's one factor out of many. Also, if it's an average of pros, it doesn't matter if you're tanking. Even in theory alone (taking pro averages out of the equation) as a tank you get more assists than anyone, resulting in a good KDA if played properly. \n\nWill take it all into consideration, however.\n\nThanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Matthevv","date":"2014-11-30T04:58:28.781+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> You're putting a lot of emphasis on KDA, when it's one factor out of many.

If it sounds like I put so much emphasis on it, it is because of how much your site put an emphasis on it.\n\nAs for damage taken, you are thinking too narrowly about the cause and effect of damage taken and skill. Co-relation is not causation. Damage taken as a stat should never be looked at solely by itself.","replies":[{"poster":"Phreaktastic","date":"2014-12-03T16:06:37.060+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Literally my second sentence was telling you to stop putting so much emphasis on k/d/a. If it sounds like I put so much emphasis on it, it is because of how much your site put an emphasis on it.\n\nIf the website has multiple stats, and in one circumstance (as it fluctuates per match) you have 7 other alerts, how exactly is the website \"putting so much emphasis\" on KDA? Is 12.5% heavy emphasis? Again, if you don't want your KDA being compared to Challenger averages, don't look. You're fixated on one piece of a much larger puzzle.\n\n> As for damage taken, you are thinking too narrowly about the cause and effect of damage taken and skill. Co-relation is not causation. Damage taken as a stat should never be looked at solely by itself.\n\nThat's partially accurate. In most standard matches, your damage taken **is** linear and reflects your ability to stay out when necessary. Soak champions are an exception, and so are tanks. For ADCs, however, it's **extremely** linear. Higher damage taken on a glassy champ means less time in the battle. If you don't believe that, look at the matches you are questioning. When your damage taken is higher *as a carry*, is your gold earned less than your adversary's? Is it lower than the average Challenger? Trust me, I've run thousands of reports to get averages of damage between every tier of play and the metrics I'm presently using are the result of that. As has been mentioned a few times, the red flags for certain champs (Trynd, Mao, Vlad, etc.) when they receive more damage is not accurate. Exceptions aside, having less damage taken across the board equates to better games. If what you were telling me were true, you'd be Challenger and the Challenger data I've harvested over the past months would coincide with what you're saying. You're literally arguing with statistics. My website simply tells you whether you outperformed your adversary and a challenger in your shoes based on multiple different metrics. I'm not thousands of Challengers. I'm not millions of other players. I did not *create* these statistics, I collected them.\n\nBTW, you will never see Damage Taken looked at \"solely by itself\". In fact, if you find a single report containing only Damage Taken (and rating your match based solely on it, by itself) send me a screenshot. We'll talk then.\n\nThis is why each match has it's own overall rating. Sometimes you'll do great with a sub-par KDA, or with more damage taken than your adversary or a Challenger average. In those matches, if everything else is done well, you'll still receive high marks.\n\nIt seems to me you don't like how your report is showing and directing that frustration to my website. That's fine, don't use it. Some people can't handle being told their KDA was below the Challenger averages. Some people can't handle being told their Damage Taken for their champ was higher/lower than Challenger averages. Some people can't handle being told their lane opponent outperformed them in certain aspects. I'm not catering to those people. I have no interest in giving out fortune cookies to the soft hearted.\n\n>-Your KDA was lower than your adversary’s.\n-Your damage dealt to champions is lower than your adversary’s. \n-Your damage taken is higher than your adversary’s. \n-The enemy team built tanky, but you did not counter them with penetration. \n-Your gold earned this match was lower than your adversary’s.\n\nThis report was from your Lucian game. Trust me, **this match was not rated based on *one* stat**. \n\n>-Your KDA was lower than your adversary’s. \n-Your damage dealt to champions is lower than your adversary’s. \n-Your damage taken is lower than your adversary’s. That is good.\n-The enemy team built tanky, and you countered them.\n-Your gold earned this match was lower than your adversary’s.\n\nIf you were correct, this match wouldn't be rated Challenger. Your KDA, Damage Dealt, and Gold are all lower than your adversary's. You still got Challenger.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Baval","date":"2014-11-23T14:44:39.535+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello again.

Looks like things might need some work with higher elos","replies":[]},{"poster":"Astronomity","date":"2014-11-23T22:48:52.405+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have a bit of a gripe.

You're less likely to lose if you're doing well. Your match rank is not dictated by win or loss, but the exact opposite is typically true.","replies":[{"poster":"Baval","date":"2014-11-24T00:56:56.027+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It seems to have totally screwed the system.
