You know, the ones who run it down mid, repeatedly tell everyone that they don't care if they win, etc.\n\nI get it, it's a fun mode. It's not ranked, the pressure is way lower, we're all here to have fun. However, how much fun do you think the other 4 players on your team are having if you're intentionally throwing to prove a point? How much fun is _anyone _(enemy team included) having if you just run it down? The same rules apply, no matter the game mode: inting/AFKing/otherwise ruining gameplay for others is all applicable in every single mode.\n\nSeriously, one of the worst things about URF/ARURF/Nexus Blitz/Poro King/etc is that people use it as an opportunity to be as toxic as they possibly can. On PBE, this was not an issue at all. People were there to play. Now that it's live, at least 30% of my games thus far have been people who flame/afk/int as soon as something doesn't line up with their tunnel vision (either on the enemy team or my own).\n\nI played a game where a duo told us Shaco was at dragon, backed off our base (we were losing handily), and then made fun of him in all chat when he died. In all chat, they continued to say things like \"lol i don't care about winning\" and \"who tf cares about macro in urf\". Someone on my team asked them what Shaco did to make them so mad. Their response? \"he wants to macro in urf\". \n\nWe ended up winning a game we should not have won, just because two people wanted to prove the point that they don't care about winning. That's not fun for me, and two others on my team were pretty verbal about their disapproval. I dare bet that the greater portion of the playerbase does not play this game hoping for someone (or multiple people) on the enemy team to troll their own team into a loss, especially in something like URF.\n\nI'm not asking anyone to try as though it were ranked. Play random champs, build them in crazy ways, do all the things that make URF fun. However, actively attempting to spite team mates for whatever reason is just plain stupid. There is nothing to be gained in that scenario. \n\nCan we just skip that kind of behavior this time around? Can we stop to consider that maybe, just maybe, Riot isn't giving us fun modes any more because toxicity levels skyrocket in them? Every single time anything comes out -- be it Nexus Blitz, Poro King, whatever -- the \"lol it's a fun mode\" crowd makes absolutely sure they ruin games for as many people as possible. I'd love for URF to be on a more frequent schedule, but can't help but think it'll never happen due to the shenanigans you have to put up with just to play it.\n\nTLDR: Just because it's a fun mode, does not mean that trolling your team is fine. No one likes it, not even the enemy team.","replies":[{"poster":"Tele II","date":"2019-10-30T22:30:07.634+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree. I hate when people treat games like that. Theyve decided for you that its just gonna be a screw around and not try to win game... but then tomorrow they'll be in a different mood and suddenly take the game seriously and dont even realize the troll in their game pissing them off, is basically them from a day before lol. Like, I get the mindset. Ive had games with friends where we all play some new shit to us, and go into it thinking we're gonna get stomped, but its gonna be fun either way. But that doesnt mean we dont at least TRY to win. Its more just, we dont care if we lose. But were still gonna try to win.

If a player is doing really badly, them turning on the Lord IDGAF switch isn't likely to change anything in URF.
