Lets have something different!\n\nRemember guys, Fiora doesn't have her own special recall or any special effects within all her skins so why not release something this year for Fiora that's special and worth the price shall we? (;\n\nWhat To Expect?\n\n* Custom Recall - Fiora plays the violin, With baron she plays the tune of the violin 2x faster.\n\n* Custom Dance - Fiora plays the violin while dancing around.\n\n* Custom Taunts/Jokes\n\n* Custom SFX\n\nWhat Would Be Nice To Have On This Skin?\n\nYou guys decide and it will be mention within this thread below this question! (:\n\n**Needs to be playing the violin during her ult in mid air then its perfect. - viva le me**\n\n**Omg! her ult would be like.. she's playing her violin here and there!!! omg! with different poses!!! omg i love this idea. - Asul\n**\n\n**On Fiora's movement phrase's she could ask the summoner what kind of melody they would like to hear. Special interaction with Sona's default skin that when both champion's use the dance command they play a melody together.- What Is Smite**\n\n**Dance inspired by Lindsey Stirling's moves, yes please. -Silven**\n\n**The autoattacks can make different pitches of notes and the crits could be high notes, similar to her headmistress skin. -Biopanda** \n\n**She needs to play Bond songs and some classics like Requiem and Moonlight Sonata. That would be awesome. Requiem on ult. XD Would throw money at Riot for that every 2 minutes. - RustyMuFFins**\n\n\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Scruffy","date":"2015-01-26T19:30:07.445+0000","up_votes":57,"down_votes":0,"body":"I love this, you'd have my money.","replies":[{"poster":"coeurloyal","date":"2015-01-29T23:15:25.945+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"^ ditto","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Silven","date":"2015-01-26T10:08:13.554+0000","up_votes":28,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dance inspired by Lindsey Stirling's moves, yes please.","replies":[{"poster":"Cerbearus","date":"2015-01-26T21:10:38.699+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":0,"body":"Eh?\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvipPYFebWc","replies":[{"poster":"trexmixG","date":"2015-01-26T23:09:47.193+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"wtf did i just watch XD","replies":[{"poster":"zliplus","date":"2015-01-27T17:32:06.517+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Distilled awesomeness","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bresn","date":"2015-01-27T02:38:21.103+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Something nobody can replicate XD","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"gnov","date":"2015-01-27T04:01:03.193+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is actually really good XD","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"WhereIsMyBeefalo","date":"2015-01-26T18:39:27.725+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"10/10 would buy","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ayame Isaki","date":"2015-01-26T14:45:27.915+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wasn't that into this skin until you put this idea out there... but this would make it truly exceptional!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Solarious28","date":"2015-01-26T12:00:54.373+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fuck yea!","replies":[]},{"poster":"KnightsRoyale","date":"2015-06-26T06:55:29.876+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I imagined {{champion:114}}  dancing like her... it was pretty funny","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"jimmylism","date":"2015-01-26T13:14:30.374+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a violinist, I flinch at the thought of using the bow as a weapon but I think it would be a cool idea non the less.","replies":[{"poster":"gubigubi","date":"2015-01-26T18:39:34.633+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"She already uses a ruler in her only 975 skin so why not a bow lol","replies":[{"poster":"5000000000000000","date":"2015-11-29T21:37:21.162+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's delicate and expensive, unlike a ruler","replies":[{"poster":"4NoxiousHours","date":"2016-05-25T22:31:47.145+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=5000000000000000,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=bP7Auw76,comment-id=000e00020000,timestamp=2015-11-29T21:37:21.162+0000)\n>\n> It&#x27;s delicate and expensive, unlike a ruler\n\nLOL","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Wulf Helhammer","date":"2015-01-26T06:23:39.285+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"For the song and dance, you could with pretty much anything from lindsey stirling","replies":[{"poster":"I am PewdiePie","date":"2015-11-29T19:56:55.183+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Avantel,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=bP7Auw76,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-01-26T06:23:39.285+0000)\n>\n> For the song and dance, you could with pretty much anything from lindsey stirling\n\nYou know there's more violinists in the world than her, right?","replies":[{"poster":"Wulf Helhammer","date":"2015-11-29T21:31:48.076+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There aren't really any violinists that dance while the play","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"MaliceCity","date":"2015-01-26T23:04:01.449+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is a great concept!
