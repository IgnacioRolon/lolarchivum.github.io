He's also a risky pick even if you're really good at him, since the enemy jungler can pretty much decide you lose lane if they're willing to spend enough time to do so. However, if you can manage to get past these shortcomings, Yasuo is still extremely rewarding and worthwhile. \n\nDespite what some people think, Yasuo is still more than capable of winning a lvl 1 or lvl 2 all in against pretty much every champ in the game, even the top lane bullies like {{champion:114}} {{champion:86}} {{champion:58}} {{champion:92}} {{champion:122}}  However, this requires a level of understanding of Yasuo's mechanics that 90%+ of the people that play him do not have, and should only be attempted by players who know exactly what they're capable of. Because, if you fuck up and get chunked, or worse, die, you cannot farm for the rest of the laning phase. But if you can manage to secure an early lead, you can continue to lane and dominate even against Yasuo's hardest counters. A Yasuo that manages to get ahead is as oppressive as he ever was. The insane synergy with AOE knockup champs is still there. The absurd mid game power spike is still there. And the 1v5 potential, when properly played, is definitely still there.\n\nIf you're good enough at Yasuo to make it past his risky laning phase very consistently, he's definitely still a strong pick. I have a 61% win rate with him as of this moment in Plat 3, and I regularly blind pick him and get hard counterpicked, as well as getting camped very often. In my mind, {{champion:157}}  is in a near perfect spot right now: Potentially extremely rewarding if you're good at him, and too risky and difficult for the average joe to pick him.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Thefriendlyorc","date":"2015-02-19T07:07:13.327+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If he's a good player who understands the mechanics of the champion he's somewhat overwhelming.

He's like Zed in the sense that the person playing them usually has to screw up for you to get ahead, instead of you just outplaying them, and frankly, I find that really irritating.","replies":[{"poster":"Thefriendlyorc","date":"2015-02-19T07:13:56.518+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is, honestly I had to fight him so much in season 4 that I learned a few of his counters, Zed is the strongest one of him and with him so popular I havent seen much Yasuo. I will say, that his kit, like most of the hyper mobility champions, feels INCREDIBLY overtuned and overpacked. Malphite passive, in addition to double crit range ANY Ad damage dealer would kill for, not one but two AOE knock ups, a defensive ability that makes Braum's entire kit look like an afterthought, and an ult that has a description almost as long as my reply here. He just does SO much for reasons.","replies":[{"poster":"Direwolfiez","date":"2015-02-19T07:19:26.915+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Took the words out of my mouth, man.  I mean, I get that mADCs need steroids to remain relevant, but the x2 crit chance coupled with the bonus armor pen on his ult is more than enough, IMO.  I don't get why they don't just rework him already, it's obvious to just about everyone that, in his current state, if he gets meaningfully buffed he'll be just as horrible to play against as he used to be, which will just result in more nerfs, and the cycle will begin again, ad infinitum.","replies":[{"poster":"Thefriendlyorc","date":"2015-02-19T07:25:26.546+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly a good Yas player has to pick his counters as bans, then suggest a knock up champion for a Top/Jungler. Malph, j4, Vi all fit this, super tanky for him to secondarily initiate, use the insane armor pen+free shield+ insane aoe damage he gets from his multiple Qs. I think whats most annoying is he has little to no cds on his abilities. The win wall feels like his longest one (I swear that ult has no cd) and against any mana user his mere presence causes pressure. You get close enough to pop his shield with a ranged auto, he dashes to the 3 minions you are near, hits you with the 4th E for max damage, either evading your defensive spell OR just nullifying it.. Its just too much. So many things you need to plan for and anticipate while on a mana user early.","replies":[{"poster":"Toastey","date":"2015-02-19T07:55:27.328+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"they nerfed his e; the dmg only stacks to 2 stacks for +50% instead of the old 4 stacks for +100% dmg","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Toastey","date":"2015-02-19T07:22:13.436+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The description on his ulti is only long because of shitty ability description writers who don't know how to condense their English.\n\nCondensed:\n\"Yasuo regenerates max Flow and blinks to Airborne enemies, keeping them Airborne for 1 second.

It's also on a low cooldown becuase its practical cooldown is so much longer. If you took every possible Yasuo ulti in, you'd die all the time and accomplish nothing. You also need knockups in your teamcomp for your ulti to even matter mid-game and late-game.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Stars Shaper","date":"2015-02-19T08:11:21.632+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yasuo is one of those champions that needs both a good player and a good team to be effective.\n\nBefore his recent buff (the 3 sec cd on Q baseline) his early game was really lacking and the previous nerfs made it so he was barely useful at anything than initiating on asleep opponents.\n\nI also think he is in the wrong category. Yasuo isn't a fighter, any fighter has more defenses than him an can stay longer in any fight. Dammit even some assassins can soak more damage than him before feeling in the need to get away.\n\nBut he also is quite easy to deal with if you know what he does because he is rather predictable (and still most ppl don't know what projectiles are and will try to wall your rays/dashes xD). He sure has a lot of utility but it can only serve him to delay the inevitable if his team isn't coordinated.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Veraska","date":"2015-02-19T07:26:22.343+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i can't play him so i wouldn't call him as faceroll as like a kat or riven, but i wouldn't say his skill cap is TOO high (im only silver 4 and never really tried learning him, so i can't really say how hard he is, just that i haven't done well on him)\n\ni think he's sleeper OP in which whenever i see one he just kinda decimates the game, the last few games ive played against him in mid he just went super hard on my from the very beginning and just seemed to straight up beat me through raw stats (did more dmg, took less dmg) so i have a hard time seeing where \"his work early game\" is, maybe against poke?\n\nnot noobish, but the skills he teaches you don't really translate to the rest of the roster, zero resource management tends to mean learning him as your 1st champion tends to gimp you're skills in those thing when learning your next few champs.\n\ni don't hate him, he's fun to play, but he's no fun to play against, and if he gets going it kinda just feels like game over","replies":[]},{"poster":"Toastey","date":"2015-02-19T07:12:16.449+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yasuo is extremely high skillcap. It's really easy to misuse his windwall (or to forget to use it entirely), it's really easy to not set up your dash sequence properly (lots of dashes requires a creep wave anyway), and Q (while easy to land) IS a skillshot. On top of that, the timings for his ulti are really wonky. On stuff like Thresh Flay and Gragas ulti, you have only a split second to press R. On stuff like Lee Sin ulti or Janna tornado, you have well until after the knockup looks like it has subsided.\n\nIs he freelo? Hardly. Maybe when he came out and his numbers were blatantly broken. However, the hard nerfs to his passive shield. his E damage, his HP, and his ulti range have all but destroyed him. He's barely viable mid anymore, and he can only win a select few toplane matchups. Jungle Yasuo is cheesy and easy to counter with a proper team and a proper jungler. His laning phase is very, very weak. He gets out-traded by almost every champion, out-farmed by almost every champion, and he contributes almost nothing to a gank when his jungler comes. He has a medium-sized power spike for a couple minutes when he buys Statikk Shiv, and then he's weaker than everyone else in the game until he gets his IE (which recently got nerfed). After he gets his core (Statikk, IE, BotRK), he does good damage but gets two-shot by any sort of burst whatsoever. He never gets a chance to deal his damage, and his teamfight potential is awkward at best. If he builds defensive items, he won't scale into the late game. If he builds full offensive items, he must be played as an assassin: one-shot or be one-shot. On top of all that, his ulti is basically a 1-second self-stun. The animation is about 1 second long, does no damage until the end, and doesn't make him untargetable. Sure, it's CC, but it's rare to get a 5-man Yasuo ulti.\n\nIs he noobish? No. Again, he's extremely difficult to play well. It's too easy to mess up with him and just feed.\n\nDo I hate the Yasuo? Yes, in his current state. He's weak. He's underpowered yet hard to play. Since he's a fantastic character but a bad champion, he's also a bit of a noob (read: feeder) magnet.","replies":[]}]}
