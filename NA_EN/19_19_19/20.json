Ranking it up granted you so many benefits for zero increase in mana cost. Reduced cooldown, increased slow, 50+ base damage per rank if you're using it right, waveclear, etc.\n\nIts base damage is very, very high when you use a minion to hit a champion. Its high slow made followup with his Q and ultimate and jungler ganks very easy.\n\nHe was just a very good champion top lane that could use his mana very efficiently to win almost any lane matchup and apply pressure to the rest of the map with his ultimate.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Thefriendlyorc","date":"2015-02-27T02:30:40.990+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Honestly? Because he was successful in a role.\n\nEdit: because they probably felt his skill shot aoe shout was too 'overbearing' and has 'no counter play' despite sion literally shouting it's counter when he uses it.
