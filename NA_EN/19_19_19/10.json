I'm pretty the design is meant to be the same, it's just the direction that the dragon is facing that makes it look different. When I think Chinese Dragons, I think they have long tails, small arms, and no legs. This dragon has hind legs, it resembles Shyvana's previous dragon forms easily. The only other problem I can think of is the tail, because it looks a little funny. Other than that, I don't see how this could resemble Ao Shin in any way.","replies":[{"poster":"GreenLore","date":"2015-02-09T14:17:36.765+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"What I meant with Ao shin was more in the direction,that if they probably want to design him properly,before they do a skin,that uses the same concept.\n\nThere are definetly ways to make the skin look different,but it is kinda hard to do that if they aren't sure what Ao shin is going to look like.(something like that supposedly happened with dianas dark-valkyrie-skin and syndra,where they removed part of dianas skin,to make her look less like syndra)\nIf they find the perfect design for a chinese dragon that fits into the game,then they'd use it for ao shin,not for a shyvana skin.\n\n\nAlso I wouldn't say it resembles shyvanas other dragon forms,that much.\nShyvanas dragon forms have wings(or similar stuff) on her front-arms,chinese dragons have usually an extremely long neck and overall a serpentine body,which shyvanas dragon form also lacks and chinese dragons are actually very often depicted with hind legs(just google chinese dragons and in most of the cases they will have hind legs,even ao shins original design has them),but said hindlegs are usually rather small,while shyvana has long hindlegs,giving her even the ability to stand on her hind legs.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Ve1vet","date":"2015-02-09T21:50:31.300+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":1,"body":"What do you think of maybe a Lunar Revel Shyvana or Warring Kingdoms?

The Idea of Shyvana having that steam sound effect and visually seeing it is something unique. To answer your wingless dragon question think about how in movies, shows, anime, and cartoons would have that one unique dragon who can fly without wings. Chinese dragons can fly without wings and to put another example, Rayquaza from Pokemon is a dragon who is also wingless and can fly. If I had the skill to draw you my vision I would've done so (but my drawing skills are level 1) but here's a picture of my vision that I luckily found on the internet.*\n\nhttp://fc09.deviantart.net/fs51/i/2009/324/c/7/A_Wingless_Dragon_by_xXgunderXx.jpg\n\n*This is a wingless dragon that has the look potential for Shyvana's dragon decent. It's fearsome, perfect length, and fearless.*\n\n*Now about colors, most of the base colors have already been used up for each Shyvana's skins and when it comes to Dragons you want some dark coloring that shows you that fearsome side. Adding any light colors would only make Shyvana seem girly and un-cool. We're making a Dragon here not a Zyra skin ya know? So what if in this skin we add her armor to be metallic black, mixed with gold trim and having the color yellow within the gold.*\n\n\n*And then her skin color it could possibly be her original classic splash art or maybe you can create a different color of skin, honestly you don't have to change her skin color to her original self but it can also be like her other skins, paleish skin color but who knows.*\n\n*Can't picture it? here's an example*\n\nhttp://designbuddy.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/gold-colored-mask.jpg\n\n*Black armor mixed with gold trim and a inner yellowness while skin color being her original self.*\n\n\n*IDK THIS IS ALL I CAN THINK OF I FEEL LIKE I FAILED LOL*\n\n*here are some extra random touches of gold mixed with black*\n\nhttp://fc05.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2013/208/8/2/black_and_gold_orb_dragon_by_kimrhodes-d6fhubp.jpg\n\nhttp://th00.deviantart.net/fs70/PRE/i/2014/197/6/f/black_and_gold_dragon_helmet_by_azmal-d7qxwjd.jpg","replies":[{"poster":"Kindlejack","date":"2015-02-11T17:18:46.338+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for taking a crack at it, I think you've got some cool solutions there and I had a blast imagining dragons.

That's what I was talking about when it comes to gold within yellow or the other way around haha. Of course this dragon would be armored and it would just look extra epic.*\n\n*\"but then my feeling is the colours and design will look too much like the base model once they are far away in-game\" *\n\n*what if you customize Shyvana'a armor looking black with a gold trim around it? This is where you're imagination begins. Lets picture her armor to have those festival mask around certain parts of her armor to bring out that culture and difference upon her other skins.*\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/byQS9pQ.jpg\n\n*Here's a picture that I only used hue/saturation to give you an example, you see how the armor looks blackish now and the colors are yellowish gold? You can have a gold beam color shining out through the eyes of the mask. She will have shining beams that will express out her armor. IF girls like to show off there dress in reality, then im pretty sure girls who would wear armor back in the eras wants to show off how epic they look in it.*\n\n\n*but who knows right? maybe this time instead of armor you guys want to try a dress to bring out the inner chinese new years festival where she  Shyvana would dress like this *\n\nhttp://fc06.deviantart.net/fs71/i/2013/012/d/3/chinese_new_year_2013_by_averyrukito-d5rbdjl.jpg\n\n*but in black and gold trims and a dragon design on her dress with black stockings. who knows I'm just coming up with the inner festivals (x*","replies":[{"poster":"Kindlejack","date":"2015-02-12T06:20:11.949+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sweet!
