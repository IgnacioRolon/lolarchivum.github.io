I don't think anybody is going to fault Sona for having a skill that generally is the very last to get leveled. I don't mind what you do to Sona, but if \"one point wonder\" skills is on your radar I'd like you to look at many of the other champions that have them and see what can be done about those.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mialee","date":"2014-08-03T07:17:29.833+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First of all thanks for the reply.\n\nThe reason I proposed the scaling being more than 1% is first, as I previously mentioned, the fact that the champion will obtain more than a single skill path and second the fact that it will resemble more the way old E used to work. \n\nOld passive movement speed used to be 4/8/12/16/20 therefore going from rank one to rank was an increase in value by 100% while going from 13 to 14 is an increase by ~7.5%\n\nI have a lot of Sona experience myself and unlike many other players i highly valued E as a spell. My usual skill path order early levels used to be WQQEQRQEQER\nor\nWQQEQRQEQWR\n\nDuring later levels I used to keep W and E at a similar level or str8 up leveling E while keeping W at rank one or two.\n\nThe old spell gave a player the option to decide between higher mobility or healing since every rank gave a more noticeable increase in power.\n\nAs you noticed the numbers I proposed did not have the purpose of buffing or nerfing the ability but rather slightly alter it to a state where most of the current feeling one rank gives is preserved while simultaneously the ability does NOT have to be a \"one point wonder\" which sounds like a wrong designing idea to begin with since it limits the abilities of the champion to two plus one rank in another plus ulty.\n\nThink of  13 / 14 / 15 / 16 / 17 % to\n 10 / 12 / 14 / 16 / 18 \nor\n 11 / 13 / 15 / 17 / 19 \n2% difference per rank \nThese any values will give a better overall feeling to the ability in my opinion.\n\n\nAlso Fearless on a different note, I have another idea about Sona's abilities than if implemented will provide a lot of satisfaction to both nostalgic and new players.\n\nA big part of the old abilities was the passive aura part that provided useful stats only only to the other team members but also to Sona herself. With this in mind I believe that some of that power can be given to Sona herself without being an aura.\n\nThink about this Sona knows songs playing the songs gives the stats as they are right now the shield the damage to the next auto attack the speed buff etc. But what about learning the song? When you learn the song you can acquire passive bonuses, these bonuses will act like old auras but will only affect Sona since she learnt a new song. Of course the values should not be as high as before since  4/8/12/16/20 AD/AP,  3/6/9/12/15 armor/mr, and 4/8/12/16/20 ms as permanent bonuses would be too much since Sona would have them permanently after learning the new song and now just playing it. \n\nFor example in E's case \npassive could be 2/4/6/8/10 or 3/6/9/12/15 flat MS boost and active \n8/10/12/14/16 or 9/11/13/15/17 % MS boost (values lower than current values to compensate for the flat increase)\n\nHaving some of these passive bonuses affect Sona but not her allies makes them way easier to balance, since they do not double triple or quadruple randomly whenever some ally passes by like they used to in the past. Also by introducing this idea, a big part of the feeling the old abilities used to give will be preserved while simultaneously the more impactful nature of the new abilities will also be present. \n\nThis change will also provide the following benefits \n1) the abysmal wave clear of Sona with auto attacks right now will improve (in the past every single auto attack used to be +20 dmg at level 9), this is very very important for Sona since she often has to play a role similar to lulu karma or zyra support/mid but she lacks their AOE to kill minions. The changing in her AA dmg value was very impactful to her and some of the lost damage can be re introduced.\n2) Players will be able to feel they can alter their path according to the circumstances for example if you get heavily harassed in lane you can try maxing W for passive (proposed values + 2/4/6/8/10 armor and mr) without being punished by the forbidding mana cost increase of the actual active.\n3) The passive values even if insignificant can provide a big psychological boost especially since they will resemble the old abilities","replies":[{"poster":"Pika310","date":"2014-08-05T22:03:05.315+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> During later levels I used to keep W and E at a similar level or str8 up leveling E while keeping W at rank one or two.\n> \n> The old spell gave a player the option to decide between higher mobility or healing since every rank gave a more noticeable increase in power.\n\nLikewise.  If my team was constantly winning teamfights and being forced to chase down stragglers or constantly catching individuals out of position, I would opt for further points in E earlier as it felt like a more aggressive and snowball type ability to take when ahead.  That and the base increases on W per rank used to be slightly lackluster.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"RCIX","date":"2014-08-03T05:05:21.098+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The thing that rubs me the wrong way is that it feels like its a spell that should just have no scaling, but it would feel weird to actually have no scaling on a spell.
