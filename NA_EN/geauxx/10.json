It's very easy for good teams to gameplan and draft around this. He doesn't play utility ADCs well. He doesn't play well when the game is supposed to be played through top or mid.

Pobelter seems like a great guy, but he's an \"average\" midlaner (average for Pros, yeah he's way better than any given rando, but significantly worse than many pro midlaners).  I think he holds up ok and can do his part in team fights, but he goes behind in lane phase on the regular and if the team can't carry him to an advantage then he's pretty ineffective.  I'm wondering if Olleh can make the next step.  I think he's got skills, but nerves are obviously a problem (see: MSI).  The other 3 are not the absolute \"best\" at their positions, but I think they can hang with Worlds talent. (altho not sure what effect age will have by next year)\n\nThe current TL roster can dominate NA because the 3 can cover up the weaknesses of the 1.5 (Olleh doesn't have the 'nerves' issue in NA, but runs hot/cold based on other factors) and none of the other teams are strong enough to completely exploit the gaps. (ie. go even or better against their top 3, while dominating the weaker 2)  But the better worlds teams CAN do so.  Bluntly put, the BEST international teams (especially the Korean Worlds winners) usually have solid performers at all 5 positions.  Whether due to skill or nerves, NA doesn't usually field a team that can match that criteria, and in many cases they get boned when the weak link gets dominated.  The exception that immediately comes to mind is last year's TSM who either didn't have the confidence or were simply overly protective of their weaknesses and eventually lost when teams were able to force (and win) a team fight on their terms.  Last year's TSM could've gotten out of groups if they'd USED their massive gold advantage appropriately instead of sitting on it for long stretches until the enemy felt comfortable to just say \"nothing to lose, let's go!\"","replies":[{"poster":"IOffMeta GtOvrIt","date":"2018-10-17T20:32:04.076+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"and to be honest its the mindset as well, eastern cultures are more holistic while western cultures are more individualistic, everyone wants to be the star.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2018-10-17T21:11:03.617+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Spank the Fox,realm=OCE,application-id=9hBQwnEU,discussion-id=KgvO7UYU,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2018-10-17T11:53:23.832+0000)\n>\n> DLift still needs a better team.

Last time I checked those were close games. And after all they got EU imports for a reason. They carry more often than drag.\n\n2. If you want to talk about shitstomping look at FNC vs 100T. C9 managed to get max 8k gold lead vs VIT and both those games were long as fuck. Meanwhile FNC \"shitstomped\" 100T and had 13k (team score 14:4) and 17k (team score 16:1) gold leads in both games. So educate yourself before talking about \"shitstomping\" so you don't look as salty and as dumb as you do now. \nAlso let's just ignore the fact G2 beat RNG in BO5 and FNC is actually looking like the strongest team atm so your region doesn't look such a failure in comparison.\n\n3. KR support import? Is that all you got? Last time I checked KR isn't the highest bar anymore and your NA teams are basically made out them. 100T = 2 KR and 1 CN. :D TL = 2 KR players.  What an ignorant and stupid argument. Do you think before you say something? Meanwhile C9 is the most successful team and they dont even have any KR players. They need EU imports with carry roles like jungle, mid to win. So your argument about some KR support is completely comic because he is just the guy doing his job and not the one making the big shots and plays like Perkz and Wunder. EU > KR and NA isn't even close. Get more EU imports and deal with it, kid. \n\n4. Disprove \"facts\" of some salty troll? I did that every single time, you just can't accept the facts. Also performances speak louder than words.
