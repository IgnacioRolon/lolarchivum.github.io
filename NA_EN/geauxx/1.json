I learned from my mistakes from group stage.\nTheir gameplay is so cheesy but it's so strong in this meta. RNG struggles when it's not standard 5v5 games and when teams force their hand.\n\nI'm still not sure if it's entirely because of the meta or because the players from the west also got a lot better. One thing is certain: individual mechanical plays > shotcalling and that's a huge benefit for western teams who always failed in the lategame shotcalls.\n\nBut yeah, I thought KT would make it to finals, though. guess FNC will have to beat G2 then.","replies":[]},{"poster":"HopeStartsWithU","date":"2018-10-20T13:15:18.461+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Except I did and I fucking KNEW G2 would win.","replies":[{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2018-10-20T13:19:41.247+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=HopeStartsWithU,realm=EUW,application-id=9hBQwnEU,discussion-id=ybPQdRWk,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2018-10-20T13:15:18.461+0000)\n>\n> Except I did and I fucking KNEW G2 would win.\n\nYou are not one of the two people that have perfect picks shut up.","replies":[{"poster":"HopeStartsWithU","date":"2018-10-20T14:12:15.538+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Ofc I don't have the perfect pick em lmao, this year group stage was impossible to guess.
