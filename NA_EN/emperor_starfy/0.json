I&#039;ve truly been trying to reform, and I honestly have gotten much better. It had been at least a month since my last punishment, and I have played very frequently since then. I have avoided flaming almost all together, except for the rare situation where a toxic player is flaming, and I flame back. In my most recent game, I was perma banned. I realize I deserve punishment, but after a month of avoiding toxicity (which is a huge milestone for me where I would get punished just after being unpunished), it feels unfair to have one bad game completely delete my account.\r\n\r\nI realize I was toxic in this game, but I feel as if one game isn&#039;t enough to justify permanently banning someone.\r\n\r\nGame 1\r\nIn-Game\r\nEmperor Starfy: nah bot lane winning\r\nEmperor Starfy: xin they had lane priority we didnt\r\nEmperor Starfy: i was just getting to lane\r\nEmperor Starfy: understand lane priority before you flame\r\nEmperor Starfy: xin you&#039;re the reason we&#039;re losing\r\nEmperor Starfy: bot is doing great despite having 0 ganks\r\nEmperor Starfy: 0/4/1 on early game champion\r\nEmperor Starfy: my lane isnt losing\r\nEmperor Starfy: malz has one death\r\nEmperor Starfy: and fizz has 6 kills\r\nEmperor Starfy: FUCK\r\nEmperor Starfy: no xin you keep dying\r\nEmperor Starfy: is the problem\r\nEmperor Starfy: you are 0/4\r\nEmperor Starfy: malz is doing fine\r\nEmperor Starfy: but you are feeding fizz\r\nEmperor Starfy: 1v1s dont matter\r\nEmperor Starfy: you are 0/4\r\nEmperor Starfy: give up scuttles\r\nEmperor Starfy: you literally died for a scuttle botside\r\nEmperor Starfy: again\r\nEmperor Starfy: priority\r\nEmperor Starfy: they had it we didnt\r\nEmperor Starfy: xin do you konw how lane priority works\r\nEmperor Starfy: im joking its clear you dont\r\nEmperor Starfy: taking red instead of protecting turret\r\nEmperor Starfy: xin just shut up and stop losing the game for us\r\nEmperor Starfy: xin shut up\r\nEmperor Starfy: already\r\nEmperor Starfy: 0/5\r\nEmperor Starfy: no xin you are bad\r\nEmperor Starfy: its not malz&#039;s fault\r\nEmperor Starfy: you are just bad\r\nEmperor Starfy: xin\r\nEmperor Starfy: im carrying you\r\nEmperor Starfy: why are you such an ass\r\nEmperor Starfy: do you know what fear is\r\nEmperor Starfy: it makes me not able to control my movements\r\nEmperor Starfy: also 0/6\r\nEmperor Starfy: 0/6\r\nEmperor Starfy: 0/6\r\nEmperor Starfy: and he&#039;s taking blue\r\nEmperor Starfy: you&#039;re not worth anything, so you should sacrifice for the 50 50\r\nEmperor Starfy: yep just keep splitpushing\r\nEmperor Starfy: report xin please\r\nEmperor Starfy: 0/7\r\nEmperor Starfy: very toxic all game\r\nEmperor Starfy: says he&#039;s only playing bad because team\r\nPost-Game\r\nEmperor Starfy: report xin zhao\r\nEmperor Starfy: apparently its mid&#039;s fault he lost early game\r\nEmperor Starfy: because fed fizz\r\nEmperor Starfy: a super fed assasssin\r\nEmperor Starfy: vs an ad carry\r\nEmperor Starfy: i wonder whats going to happen\r\nEmperor Starfy: he wasnt fed when you died\r\nEmperor Starfy: and you&#039;re an early jungler","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-01-31T23:51:41.128+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"OP, you weren't permabanned for one game with bad behavior.

There have been several threads around here asking about such punishments. A few players have gotten two-week bans from games with one or two possibly-intentional deaths, and by \"intentional\" I mean \"it looks like maybe they weren't quite trying hard enough right then.\"\n\nIf someone was stealing your camps and emote spamming, complaining about it in chat just bothers everyone else and feeds the troll.

I had already gotten all checkpoints for the bottom honor level, and had shown signs of reforming. But even reformed most previously toxic players will end up having one game, and it happens to almost everyone who has a history of toxicity. It just feels unfair that I was reforming and had one bad game and lose my entire account, along with hundreds of dollars for it.\n\nEdit: The point I'm focusing on is one game. One game for a permaban. If I had flamed three games out of 10 or something, then yea, I'd accept the permaban, because I'd without a doubt deserve it. But for having no punishments in over a month, to losing my account over one bad game just feels incredibly unfair.\n\nEdit2: Also doesn't 3-4 months of being not just a neutral mute-all player, but a player with overwhelming positivity every game feel like a bit too long for someone to have the state reset?","replies":[{"poster":"DrCyanide","date":"2019-01-31T21:36:59.277+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I believe the idea is that people should start changing when they get their first chat restriction, instead of trying to turn 180 at the last warning.\n\nThat said, I agree.

You&#x27;re unwilling to do so because you can&#x27;t\n\nAlso the reason it's usually from punished players is because they're frustrated that their games are routinely ruined and yet they get in trouble because they typed words in a chat box with near 0 impact on the mechanics of the game.\n\nHow many people do you see on boards complaining that they got punished for trolling? Literally 0 (if you exclude the inting sion snafu a while back haha) it's all about chat. When people initially complained about toxicity in league it was rarely for chat and mostly for peoples actual in game actions.","replies":[{"poster":"CharDeeMcDenniz","date":"2019-02-01T01:03:37.241+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"oh you want examples?\n\n> https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/E4LnThmW-most-ridiculous-chat-restriction-i-have-ever-seen-in-my-life?comment=0011 \n> https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/KHAL90oW-stuck-at-honor-zero?comment=0003 \n> https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/3jEVVlsY-permanently-banned-with-ingame-log?comment=003e \n> https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/jFwTE8Oj-playing-off-meta-in-ranked-int-feeding-ban?comment=0039 \n> https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/sU5wOfFJ-proof-that-the-automated-system-is-broken?show=rundown \n> https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/GrmPK5yP-intentional-feeding-but-i-didnt-feed?comment=0006 \n> https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/MKBQUoKd-banned-for-intentionally-feeding \n> https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/KTq4tjIF-i-dont-get-it-how-riot-bans-a-player-because-another-kid-draven-decides-to-take-all-the-kills \n> https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/xW5z7auF-proof-that-riot-employees-ban-without-providing-clear-evidencecertainty-of-an-infraction \n> https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/RAfb0McT-got-banned-for-intentional-feeding-for-a-game-with-02-death\n\n\n\n\nnow its your turn, prove to me that RIOT doesn't do anything","replies":[]},{"poster":"Xidphel","date":"2019-02-01T02:01:28.174+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Good luck being an anti-rito zombie though.\n\nAlso, we're not digging for your arguments for you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"rujitra","date":"2019-02-01T00:59:55.021+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's quite a few, but many of them delete their threads after the community points out it's clear they were trolling.

My friends all quit, people quit on a daily basis and I've already put in a support ticket to delete my account because this community has just demolished my will to play.
