Need help changing it back to old one.","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"This new client is absolutely horrible.HUD wise everything is so small and has no cool animations and kind of tough to work on it as well.But the major issue is stability.The new client is VERY VERY EXTREMELY SLOW, I can't open up something without having to wait for 2-3 seconds for it to load up.What is this?Riot logic: We made a new client 1 year ago and it turned out cool, fast and stable but had a few bugs, so what do we do? We make a new client that will certainly have more bugs ESPECIALLY because of the new additions.That , is messed up.....people that is very messed up.Not only is it slow but I also have frame drops IN GAME and large ping( Why though). I can't do ANYTHING in the client or even play a game. So to resolve this issue I just switched to my old client, BUT now the is no such option my old icon has been turned to the new icon and when I log in and press \" Launch Legacy Client \" new client closes and NOTHING happens after, legacy client NEVER loads back. The trick where you go on  Riot Games/League of legends/Rads/System/user and say yes or no to optclient IS NOT THERE. So I can only assume riot got OFF BETA and switched it PERMANENTLY. BUT as you can see ITS NOT FUCKING READY YET, it needs MORE bug fixing and more beta.\nIf you know a way to switch back to old until they fix this crap client I'd be happy to listen. Thank you very much for reading this.","replies":[{"poster":"DreamieKid","date":"2016-11-24T20:16:00.622+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"new client is making me dodge games.

If you could get a handle on the performance issues then that would make it actually usable for us Toaster plebs. But it is very aesthetically pleasing IMO. This being said. Could you give a rough eta on the return of customs where I can 1v5 against bots? I use it to test the majority of my builds and would love to have it back.  \n\nALSO, The client crashes on me at the end of every game, and I have no end to the number of times it glitches out and goes black when I push lobby. you guys have this reported before me or no?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-27T22:47:30.244+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can't provide an ETA on any features for the new client since I'm not on a team that works on the client.\n\nAlso, I haven't heard of this issue before, but it's very likely tied to a poor connection to the servers.
