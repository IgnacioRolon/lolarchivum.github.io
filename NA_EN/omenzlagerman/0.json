I am in need of a kind summoner to upload his league of legends game folder to a site. I am having trouble downloading the game as my net speed is only 100 KB/s[and sometimes lower] and I have to download about 5GB and the patch downloader does not support resumeing the download [I have checked the MB, but it goes back to 5GB each time it restarts.]. I started playing league since season 1, stoped playing it at season 6 and now I want to be back to playing the game, it is a great game and I enjoy playing it just like you, but I am expreincing this problem. please help me.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-12T16:00:25.755+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"We don't have an external source beyond our patching server.  :/   100 KB is insanely slow, though.  :O  I'm not sure you would be able to play League even after an install.

You cannot play League off a USB, but you might be able to copy a fully installed folder to your external drive and transfer it over.","replies":[]},{"poster":"OmenzLagerMan","date":"2017-09-12T16:39:17.340+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I know...I have been playing with about 600ms ever since season 1 but it was an alright experience. I know there is no external source, I was just wondering if someone would upload their game to mediafire or MEGA or something, the problem is that there is no resumeing in patcher download so I am better off downloading 8 GB with resume than 5 GB with no resume...","replies":[]},{"poster":"OmenzLagerMan","date":"2017-09-12T14:29:47.016+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"bump","replies":[]}]}
