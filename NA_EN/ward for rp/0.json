Could you be referring to a different account you have? I'd be more than happy to look into what happened for ya!","replies":[{"poster":"Ward for RP","date":"2017-07-23T00:03:38.490+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, this is my main account, I played 1 game on my euw account and I noticed that I had around 200 ping, so I decided to kind of forget about it. I'm assuming that my account might have been triggered by some sort of automatic botting prevention because I'm guessing they run a lot of VMs to level their accounts. My euw account has the same username as this one. I'm not that sad about the account being banned, just concerned if other people who might play with their mains and might get banned from it.","replies":[]}]}]}
