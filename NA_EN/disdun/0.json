Does it make him overpowered, underpowered, or just right?","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The way I see it, the new Ryze rework makes him very difficult to play against. \r\n\r\n1. His E can bounce through your minion wave, and buffs his other 2 offensive spells. \r\n2. His Q is completely refreshed after every spell cast, instead of just a &quot;minus a few seconds off cd&quot; \r\n3. He gets rather bulky early game (RoA) \r\n4. [It seems like] he has a combo for every situation, whether it be doing tons of damage or making an escape. \r\n\r\nPersonally, it feels like Ryze&#039;s new update makes him very oppressive and overpowered in the laning phase and mid game.\r\n\r\nBut I may be wrong and biased cause I lost a few games and just need to git gud. What are your opinions?","replies":[{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2016-07-15T05:51:10.185+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"1: While his E bounces through the minion wave, it takes 2-3 casts for it to actually reach them all (usually).  Even if the E hits you, it doesn't do much damage on its own, and you just need to watch out for his Q or W until the mark expires (which isn't very long).\n\n2: His Q came completely off cd from casting his other spells before this rework too.  It also reduced the cd on his other spells by the cd on his Q.  His combo is far more easily controlled by Riot now.  This will also make it easier for them to fine tune his strength without turning him super weak or into a monster.\n\n3: He's no tankier than he was before (actually probably squishier with the loss of his spellvamp).\n\n4: He does have combos that wok for various situations.\n\n\n4.1: Q -> E -> Q (empowered) -> W -> Q -> E ->Q (empowered) is his max damage combo\n4.2: (Q) -> E -> W (empowered) -> Q (shield/ms) is his escape/cc combo.  The E empowered W snares for longer, and the Q cast gives the shield and movespeed boost.\n4.3: (Q) -> E -> wait -> W (empowered) -> Q (shield/ms) -> E -> Q (empowered) would be his ideal gank combo.\n\nWeaknesses:\n\n4.1: Only 1 sec of snare for the entire combo.  If you can dodge his Qs, he'll do very little damage with this combo.\n4.2: Far less damage (no empowered Q and only max of 2 Qs)\n4.3: No real weakness if it lands, but it is very telegraphed.  When marked with his E, just try to stay back until the mark fades.\n\n\nI'm sure there are more combos, but he generally has to sacrifice cc for damage or vice versa.\n\n\nIf he is a bit strong, they'll be able to adjust his power fairly easily at least.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mos Def","date":"2016-07-15T05:21:43.928+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He will probably be good in lower elo, but I think they killed him for LCS level play.

His E was always more dangerous if you were in the wave, now its just in a different way.\n2. Actually, it was completely refreshed in the previous iteration, but only when he had triggered his passive.\n3. Nothing new here\n4. That's kind of the point.  It is up to the Ryze player to decide when to use which combo.  The nice part of the rework compared to before is that he either gets maximum damage OR the shield/maximum CC, not both.  In the previous iteration, Ryze would trigger his passive and get a shield and his ability to do maximum damage.\n\nI have yet to actually play as or against new Ryze in a real game, so I don't have any experience to say if it's too oppressive or not.","replies":[]}]}
