The item is pretty stat inefficient. If you buy it in lane, I can buy a better fighting item and threaten to kill you if you ever get close enough to the tower to threaten it. I've had a few people buy it against me on the PBE, and it almost always results in them losing a lot of power, even if they were winning lane before. It's kind of like if someone decided their first item would be a GA. Just doesn't work.\n\n>Of course Bruisers would be come too powerful when split pusing and we dont want Jax being able to destroy a turret even faster.\n\nIt's unlikely Jax will be buying it. He wants strong efficient stats, and he already pushes really well without this. Instead of getting this item, why not get a stronger defensive item so you can outfight someone, or get an offensive item that will give him better pushing than the portal would?","replies":[{"poster":"Stephenizgod","date":"2015-01-08T00:29:11.192+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was thinking these voidspawn were like slightly weaker voidlings but it appears they are only really strong if you have decent resistances.
