I got home, checked my summary page in the store and it says I have zero? Is it because my acct is old that I don't get refunds, or perhaps a mishap? because I haven't used any refunds to the last of my knowledge, took about a 2-3 yr break too.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-30T23:53:13.118+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I looked into this for you, and it looks like your refund tokens were used a while, while back.  I can't really offer to many specifics over the boards due to account security, though.  Hit us up in a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and our billing and account team can offer more context.  Let us also know if there you have any specific refund requests too, we'd be happy to take a look.  See you there!","replies":[]}]}
