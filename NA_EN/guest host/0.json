While I do appreciate Riot&#039;s attention, I cannot agree with their claim that Galio needs a complete makeover. Unlike the old Warwick and Yorick, Galio is actually doing pretty well right now, just not frequently played. He has clear counters and situations in which he thrives or fails. He certainly has a unique identity and a unique niche as a champion. He is an antimage that can be built into a tank/bruiser/mage. Yes, his kit would improve with a few touches. His overall mana cost for all skills could definitely be decreased. His e should be replaced with a dash with damage. His q could also see small changes. But I really think that&#039;s about all that he needs. I just hope that Riot realizes big changes and complex kits do not always improve the game. I will stay vigilant as Riot continues to release new champions and reworks. But I am positive that my stance I proclaimed here will remain quite firm.","replies":[{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-02-06T07:14:40.381+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"His E needs changed, his W could use work.

Much like how Poppy&#x27;s ult had to change for her to have a balanced kit.\n\nWhile I agree with most of what you stated, I think his passive should remain the same or be altered so that it has two parts. His passive is such an important part of his identity as an antimage. He is currently the only champion other than Kassadin that counters magic damage.\n\nI don't understand what changes you wanted for W because it already gives increased armor and magic resist along with the ability to heal when attacked. This skill is such an essential part of Galio's flexibility when it comes to his role in the team. W not only gives extra sustain and tankiness but also gives extra damage because the increase in magic resist also increases his ability power as a result of its interaction with his passive.\n\nConclusively, I agree with you on the things that may be changed to actually improve him. But the reason I am unhappy is because Riot clearly stated that he needs a complete makeover. He really doesn't.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Hexs Fortune","date":"2017-02-06T07:34:31.386+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Galio has alot of room for change.
