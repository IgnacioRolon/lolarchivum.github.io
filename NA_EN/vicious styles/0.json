If I go to debug, it just crashes anyways. \n\nI even uninstalled and reinstalled hoping that'd fix it but it didn't. It can't be any of my hardware, because I was just playing plenty last night.\n\nRito plz, or anyone, help\n\n\nEDIT - \nIF YOU'RE READING THIS, TO FIX IT UNINSTALL OR STOP **_ LOLREPLAY_**!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","replies":[{"poster":"Zhumado","date":"2016-05-19T13:13:56.167+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have the same problem.
