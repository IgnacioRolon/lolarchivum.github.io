I hope it&#039;s a bug so it can be fixed, though.\r\n\r\nIf you right click an enemy champion or neutral monster and use Elise&#039;s rapel right afterward, you will automatically rapel down onto the enemy champion or neutral monster. This can be pretty difficult to deal with when you want to use the rapel to stall and wait to rapel onto something else when instead you just repeled right in front of the enemy front line.\r\n\r\nSo, is this a bug or is it intentional? And can it be fixed if I&#039;m not happy with it?","replies":[{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2016-09-28T09:08:16.018+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What you may actually be running into is if you have smartcasting (or was it quick?) on and you have your mouse over an enemy as though targeting them, Rappel will automatically drop on/towards them asap.  This is to make it function smoother as a gap closer.\n\nOf course, you could be aware of all I said, actually have run into a bug, and consider this comment slightly annoying.  If so, I apologize.","replies":[]}]}
