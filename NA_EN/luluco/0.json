My best advice for your account security is to reach out to our account's team in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) to make sure nothing else still has access to your account.\n\nEDIT: I'd also probably suggest ignoring any random links you might be sent unless you know what you're clicking on. If these discord servers are bothersome, you can always report them to Discord's support.","replies":[{"poster":"Saikeon","date":"2017-11-14T09:40:46.614+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's not the discord link that bothers me, it's the fact that the link was sent from my client to everyone on my friends list without me touching the league client. I was even logged in, playing another game when the message sound started ringing multiple times while this message was sent.

Please reach out to our account recovery team to see what could be done to get them signed out of the mobile app, as well as getting your password updated.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-15T04:02:07.048+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"UPDATE: I was able to push through a change that might have been able to forcibly sign other people out of the mobile app as well.
