I know how to EQ over walls I know to trap people inside my ult and EQ out, I know to poke people down in lane whenever my passive is up. But I want to add more to more abilities, as well as discuss build and different strategies.\n\nOne of the biggest things I have learned is when to just give up your ult and EQ out of it forcing your opponent to either flash or fail in getting the kill.\n\nAnother is using your passive when it is up, this damage really adds up but you need to know when it is up, 10-8-6 seconds depending on level and in lane mostly you are dealing with the 10 seconds and maybe the 8 seconds. When this passive is up especially when you opponent is high on HP you can take a good chunk out of that health bar.\n\nNext is your W, there are many uses for it. It can be used as a slow to outrun your enemies, and for the shield when in the middle of the fight. The best time for the shield is when you are in the middle of an EQ combo, you gain much more of a shield the more enemies are around which is great for diving into the middle of a team.\n\nAs for skill order I start Q then a point in E then W then I max R>Q>W>E\n\nBuild order I start Flask and after the changes to {{item:3071}} it takes longer to get the armor shred so I&#039;m not sure where to go first, if I&#039;m way ahead and they are going to start stacking armor i will rush {{item:3071}} if the enemy is AP I will go into building {{item:3156}} normally I end up with these 2 items boots {{item:3111}} most of the time then I go tanky with things like {{item:3143}}.\nIf i was behind or even especially against the like of melee like {{champion:86}} i would go {{item:3068}}\n\nIf i end up with an open spot i go with {{item:3102}}  or {{item:3026}} but my issue is I feel like I&#039;m not doing to total damage that I need to be, and I am thinking of picking up {{item:3035}} or {{item:3074}} but I then feel I will be too squishy to survive the initial burst of a fight.\n\nLets here what you guys have to say\n\nPS I am talking mainly about top J4 but welcome jg and mid ideas as well","replies":[]}
