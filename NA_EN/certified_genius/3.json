Many of us were upset because our recent acceptance meant nothing because we couldn't even sign up. However, we remained patient, hoping that soon it would be fixed. After more time passed, many of us asked for updates on the matter, but simply were linked to the [Service Status Page.](http://status.pbe.leagueoflegends.com/#pbe) This didn't provide us with any information on the matter, it simply stated that the signups were closed. This, of course, we already knew, unfortunately. The link didn't update on the matter, it remained the same throughout the weeks. Please don't take this as me \nbeing rude and impatient - I'm just worried about the state of this issue and would like a helpful response regarding its progress. Thank you for taking the time to read this, and for taking the time to resolve this issue.  What's the current status of this problem?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-27T21:30:12.778+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As you've noticed, those signups are still closed. I don't have any kind of ETA on when they'll be open again, and if we did have some kind of timeline we would definitely make it known. The status page doesn't give any more details, but as we learn more we'll be updating that page which is why it will be a good source of information as it becomes available.","replies":[]}]}
