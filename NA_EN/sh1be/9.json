I installed league twice and tried to open it, however it would take excruciatingly long. This was my third time and it won't seem to open. The first time when it loaded it stopped at 59% and wouldn't load, so I forced quit it. When I tried to reopen League again my cursor was stuck loading. I want to fix this, any suggestions or advice?","replies":[{"poster":"Sassmast3r","date":"2016-12-25T04:02:43.013+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have you tried going to the game's files and opening it that way, rather than opening it from your desktop/dock (which I assume is what you are currently doing)? Go into Finder, find League of Legends, right click it and then select \"Show Package Contents.\" Afterwards, open the file \"Contents\", then \"LoL\", then \"Play League of Legends.\" \n\nIn the past I've had a similar issue where the game would simply not function whatsoever when I tried opening it from my desktop, and when I went into the game's contents and opened it from there, the issue was fixed.","replies":[{"poster":"sh1be","date":"2016-12-26T21:26:07.911+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks that certainly worked.
