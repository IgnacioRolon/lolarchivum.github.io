I DID ** NOT** ALLOW MY BROTHER TO PLAY ON MY ACCOUNT! CHECK MY MATCH HISTORY, IT'S SIMILAR TO WHAT I USED TO PLAY. \r\n\r\nAlright so.. This problem came up in my other board, a person told me not to worry but someone threatened me about it so.. \r\n\r\nMy brother can't play his account anymore and I said I would allow him to play mine but someone told me not to. So I DID NOT ALLOW HIM TO. Yes I played a different champion but I just wanted to try it out. I was doing so well so I got cocky and said some mean things :( \r\n \r\nLike \"don't even\" when someone tried to fight me and I killed him :(( and that's not how I usually act so NOW I AM SCARED THAT IT'S CONSIDERED SUSPICIOUS THAT MY BROTHER PLAYED.\r\n\r\nThe thread is BRAND SPANKIN' NEW THE PROBLEM JUST OCCURED. \r\n\r\nI HAVE THE EMAIL LINKED TO IT. I HAVE BEEN USING THAT EMAIL SINCE FOREVER, I CAN PROVE IT. I HAVE THE PASSWORD, THE EMAIL WAS VERIFIED ON MY ACCOUNT. MY FIRST MAIN WAS LUX, THAN MORG THAN POPPY. I HAVE THE PASSWORD THAT WAS ORIGINALLY LINKED TO THE ACCOUNT BEFORE I CHANGED IT. I KNOW MY ACCOUNT WAS MADE DURING 2015-2016 BUT IT WAS NOT MADE DURING THIS YEAR.\r\n\r\nYES! I helped my brother make his account, BUT I DID NOT PLAY ON IT. He mains Ashe, I AM HORRIBLE AT ASHE.  I MADE HIS ACCOUNT NAME AND SUMMONER NAME. OUR USERNAMES ARE SIMILAR SO I COULD EASILY REMEMBER IT BECAUSE MY BROTHER FORGETS ABOUT EVERYTHING.   \r\n\r\nMY REAL PROBLEM IS.. WILL I GET BANNED BECAUSE I HELPED MAKE HIS ACCOUNT BUT **NEVER** PLAYED ON HIS ACCOUNT, HE IS THE ORIGINAL OWNER. SOMEONE THREATENED ME ABOUT THIS SO NOW I AM SCARED.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-07T21:36:23.563+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just don't share your account, and you'll be fine.  We don't support it and it can get an account banned, but worse it open it up to compromise.  Worry less about being banned, and more about keeping your [account secure](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751664-Protecting-Your-Account)!","replies":[{"poster":"sh1be","date":"2017-10-07T21:39:53.789+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks so much!
