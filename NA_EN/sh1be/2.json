Somehow your client exits itself and you reopen it. \r\n\r\nDo you still receive your S token?\r\n\r\nAsking because my computer kills itself and the end screen.. I want tokens if I did good tho.\r\n\r\nAlso with missions, do you still complete your mission? Should you not because you left? Or is it only fair that we complete the mission/receive token?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-12T02:21:49.705+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd think as long as you were in the match and not marked as AFK during the match you would still get all of those rewards even if the postgame lobby never loads. You may need to check you loot and such to make sure, and if it doesn't work for some reason just let us know.","replies":[]}]}
