I downloaded League of Legends and tried to log in. I can't log in! I checked the servers and tried to recover my account. I can also log into the League of Legends website no problem! I checked the email to recover  my account, however, there another problem I need to solve! I checked my email and I have no email about recovering my username and password. I tried multiple times and I don't want to contact League of Legends just yet and have the hassle of following their complex instructions. I also checked the League servers, everything is perfect and works perfectly. I could easily log into League on my windows computer but I don't understand why it doesn't work. Any help or advice would be great, thanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-28T00:16:55.204+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You may be having some network issues specifically connecting to our authentication servers.
