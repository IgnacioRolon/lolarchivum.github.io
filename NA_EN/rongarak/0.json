Did you receive any errors?  Did the client tell you that it had to rollback to the legacy version or did it do so on its own?  The updated client is still in testing so any info on what's going on can help, including reporting it through the tool on the bottom right of the client.  Unfortunately, we aren't able to alter game stats or remove the lower priority queue so reinstall and test it in a custom game to see if it persists.  Let me know.","replies":[]}]}
