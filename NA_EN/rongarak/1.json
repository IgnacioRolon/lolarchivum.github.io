I haven&#039;t played Nasus in a while and it seems to me that his damage output is CONSIDERABLY reduced. Usually, when I played him about 3 months ago, with 500 stacks he could take about a third of the ADC life bar. Now with 500 stacks he deal barely more damage than a normal attack (against the adc with no defense item).\r\nI didn&#039;t find notes about him being nerfed so hard, so... could anyone tell me what the hell happened!?!","replies":[{"poster":"Critmaster Garen","date":"2017-02-06T13:37:00.655+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"heals, and shields.\n\nits like you have to be able to kill them 3 or 4 times before they actually die.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ravenous Howls","date":"2017-02-06T13:24:33.260+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok looking at your match history and I got to ask... Where in the bloody hell is your sheen?! Sheen is the biggest reason Nasus hits like a truck. And empowered Q with Sheen makes you do a tremendous amount of damage. You had FH, SV and Deadman's. All good items on Nasus but you need to have your sheen in there to help you trade and sustain in fights. Typical first 2-3 backs should have you with {{item:3024}} {{item:3067}} and {{item:3057}}.\n\nDepending on enemy match up I would build {{item:3025}}, {{item:3060}} or {{item:3065}} as my first items.  Banner of command if you are against a split damage dealer like Jax/Gangplank, IBG if you are against a Riven/Fiora or SV vs Vlad/Teemo. \n\nYou did not itemize effectively against your opponent. Your masteries are odd as well. Why magic pen marks? I would take Hybrid pen or Lethality Marks and nothing else. Seals should be scaling Health, Glyphs can be CDR but I prefer Scaling MR or armor and Quints you can opt for armor or MR or Lifesteal. Life steal scales really hard into late game on Nasus. Masteries I would forgo the Cunning tree and put my 12 into Ferocity. AS, Feast/Fresh Blood, Life steal and Battle Trance. Dangerous game is conditional on the target being killed and merciless is conditional on the target being below 40% health. the ferocity tree is just better as most of the conditions are you being in battle constantly which you typically will be. Fearless is probably stronger the perseverance but that's more my personal opinion. \n\nOptimize these things and Nasus will be a beast against nearly any enemy or team.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ÅštrongMental","date":"2017-02-05T00:28:43.157+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"honestly at 500 stacks if your hitting an ADC and that adc dont fall below half health, then your not using your e or w correctly (the only exception to this is phantom dancer which MAY make that happen, but extremely rare) if you cant walk up to an adc hit them 3x while their under the effect of e, with w and finally q them and they aint dead, somethings wrong with your itemization...","replies":[{"poster":"Rongarak","date":"2017-02-05T15:36:26.241+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I hit Corki (with no defense items) 4 times with nasus q at 500 stacks while slowing him and he was still alive.\nSadly then he used his escape to fly off a ledge and I couldn't catch up to him.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"reaperteaser","date":"2017-02-05T00:21:50.973+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"they changed his ulty to give him tankyness instead of damage after he hits his q, not sure if there were more changes but that was the big one","replies":[]}]}
