It sounds like your network might be suffering from a packet loss issue that's keeping you in place.  My recommending would be to run a [log reader](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743-Connection-Troubleshooting-Log-Reader).  The tool will help find out what's going wrong as well as provide a series of instructions to get it fixed up.

Repairing the client wouldn't do too much for your connection, as it focuses more on game files.
