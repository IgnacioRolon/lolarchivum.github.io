I DON&#039;T HAVE AN ANSWER SEASON 7 IS A NIGHTMARE. \r\n\r\nSo I&#039;ve been playing video games for an eternity, and one thing that has always been an RPG mainstay is the basic separation of powers that goes into classes and character types - i.e. damage carries do damage but are squishy and vulnerable, tanks are defensive and don&#039;t do much damage but have a lot of utility, etc. I suppose there are hybrid classes out there too, and not everything is this cut and dry, but I would like to think that the overwhelming majority of games I have played have had this as a core concept behind their character development. \r\n\r\nSo why in the heck is League of Legends the only game to actually give characters options to build tanky AF and still do crap tons of damage with those same items? Like, a Jax with one AD item and a bunch of bruiser tank items shouldn&#039;t be able to 3 shot a 3K HP character, I don&#039;t care how fed that dude is. With comparable item amounts and CS, that dude shouldn&#039;t be able to literally three shot me with a bunch of tank items just because he&#039;s Jax. \r\n\r\nNow, to me, this seems brutally unfair - that Riot should time and again buff the heck out of tanks so that the game becomes actually unbearable, and reward them endlessly for being huge damage soakers and CC bots with free extra damage either in the form of base stats, or bizarre items like Titanic Hydra that say, &quot;Sure, you can have a ridiculous HP pool AND a bucket of damage, have fun!&quot; And to add insult to injury, there are basically no champs that are true &quot;tank-shredders&quot; in this meta because Riot&#039;s nerfed all of them to smithereens. \r\n\r\nAll this being said, I wonder how on earth anybody in Riot&#039;s balance team is still employed. How on earth do you manage to ruin a perfectly good game, turning it into the least balanced piece of poppycock out there, and still keep your job? MORE QUESTIONS I CANNOT ANSWER.

Sion's not bad down there either, in the right hands.\n\nAnd Shaco and LeBlanc make incredibly viable tanks too. They automatically draw eyes when they appear, and they're extremely hard to pin down. Put a Warmog and a ton of armor on them and watch the whole enemy team chase you in circles for a minute and a half while your team picks them off one by one.","replies":[{"poster":"FantasySniper","date":"2017-08-26T19:35:49.819+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A tank is someone that can take a lot of punishment and hold aggro.\nShaco and LeBlanc can't hold aggro.

He&#x27;s literally designed for it and heavily punishes people for trying to go after him.\n\nI thought so too, but I'm just that good at tanking, I guess. I consistently hold aggro with them simply by positioning and frustration tactics. I catch opponents leaning by popping up under the guise of a squishy, and every time I lose aggro, I jump back in and harass their carry. Instantly get it back. You get very rare cases where someone sees what I'm doing and ignores me, but the majority of players on the majority of teams chase me all game long.\n\nToo many people make the mistake of thinking a champion's utility is all in their kit, and neglect mind games, which are a core part of what makes PVP more fun than AI games. It also lowers overall fun level because people feel locked in to certain champions if they want to do x or y thing, which makes them miss some genuinely fun out-of-meta play. Sometimes it works even better than a meta pick.\n\nFor example, I've played plenty of Singed. The thing is, one of the first things I learned as a League newbie is \"DON'T. CHASE. SINGED.\" And a lot of people know it, because it's been spoken so many times in so many places. If I try to bait with Singed, a ton of people back right off immediately. But who ever says \"Don't chase LeBlanc?\" She's squishy, right? You focus the squishies first, until they're dead.\n\nExcept this LeBlanc has a ton of resistances and knows how to be right where she has to be to keep from getting locked down. The chase goes on, and if it lasts even 15 seconds, it's enough for decent teammates to drop half the enemy's team.","replies":[{"poster":"FantasySniper","date":"2017-08-28T03:18:58.153+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If the cheese works, go for it, but don't be surprised when it doesn't.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2017-08-26T17:14:16.920+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"RPGs with tanks aren't PVP.

Fighters and ADC several amazing resistance items (Maw, Mercurial Scimitar, Guardian Angel). Grievous wounds is available on two very good tank busting items for ADs and one near-core item for mage, while tanks have to build Thornmail, which has a crappy build path. On the subject of purely anti-adc items, Randuins is also pretty bad. Sunfire just doesn't work as a farm item anymore because you have to get stupid close to minions to use it so if you're playing against someone like a Darius or trundle who can easily out-trade you, guess what. The last decent tank items are Spirit Visage and Deadmans, and even then Deadmans slow, movespeed and bonus damage takes some walking to get charged, unlike zeal items which can charge on damage alone.\n/rant\n\nLove, a salty tank lover","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zero Shingetsu","date":"2017-08-26T16:11:24.178+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yet another reason I prefer Heroes of the Storm's method. (Wow I'm gonna get banned, aren't I... But learning from competitors is good for a company.) Not only does their system give individual heroes more personality, but it creates branching utility.\n\nYou want D.Va to do damage? She won't be as tough. You want Valla to sustain? She won't have as much raw damage. You want more CC for Morales? Her healing won't be as strong.\n\nLeague shoehorns by role, and it's all based on how pros play. That's been League's problem since they started trying to convince us video games constitute sport. They balance their game for top-tier play when the vast, VAST majority of players aren't at that level and have no intention to be. That means tanks have to be able to dish out damage, because top-tier players know how to melt tanks fairly fast and they need to have a way to back the enemy off.\n\nBut in low-tier play, it just means tanks can walk into fights and mutilate everything without effort. It also means ADCs can heal more damage per second than almost any non-ADC can put out, even with grievous wounds.","replies":[{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2017-08-26T17:13:22.705+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"HoTS can get away with it because everyone shares exp so it's not as important to get yourself ahead as it is your team.","replies":[{"poster":"Zero Shingetsu","date":"2017-08-26T17:45:00.628+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Ralanr,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=pQRBXEn7,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2017-08-26T17:13:22.705+0000)\n>\n> HoTS can get away with it because everyone shares exp so it&#x27;s not as important to get yourself ahead as it is your team.\n\nThat's true.

The faster you get ahead, the faster you get into the meat of what makes _your_ individual play style so dangerous.","replies":[{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2017-08-26T17:46:43.240+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Apply what part though?

HoTS doesn&#x27;t balance itself around items or masteries. All your gameplay choices are basically made in game and are only held back by exp.\n\nTalents. Take the system itself, the concept of adding new actives or buffing your core abilities at x levels, and it not only works fairly well in League, but it manages to be more meaningful than the item system they're currently using. League's items are also in-game choices, for the large part. Replace it with HotS's talent system and I think you have a much better game. Certain talents could even synergize with certain masteries for an added layer of customization.\n\nThe important thing for me is that a play style _feels_ like a play style. I want to play tanky because I feel comfortable getting in the enemy's face and setting my team up to look great. I don't want to play tanky because I got thrust into the jungle and our support is squishy. I want it to be my choice, and I want every tank to feel different. Sejuani should absorb punishment in a different way than Leona does it. It's like this for the first 15 minutes, but once you get into your builds, every tank starts to feel the same. (This is why I play Shaco and LeBlanc as tanks. They feel different on virtue of not having tank kits at all.)","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Shuyin178","date":"2017-08-26T18:31:56.426+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because building full tank and still getting shreded by a single champion is \"being rewarded\".","replies":[]},{"poster":"Glîtchy","date":"2017-08-26T15:40:45.993+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Most do have the core concept, however to add onto this I have seen games where a tank can have like 1 INSANE damaging ability but as a result they either,\n\n1.
