Do they hate him? Will Wolf be the one to take Ryze instead of Lamb?\r\n\r\nHow does Illaoi feel about Ryze? Would she applaud Ryze for not stopping his quest and letting nothing stand in his way?","replies":[{"poster":"WAAARGHbobo","date":"2016-08-09T14:16:16.217+0000","up_votes":21,"down_votes":0,"body":"Illaoi would applaud Ryze.  She's tough but fair.  He's found his life's purpose and is relentlessly pursuing it.  \"You are in motion, swim well till you can swim no more\"","replies":[{"poster":"Kadavik","date":"2016-08-13T08:41:46.885+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Do not go gently into that goodnight.\nRage rage against the dying of the light.\"","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Academy Kayn","date":"2016-08-09T10:37:43.353+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm kinda tired of people viewing Kindred as if they actually give a F**k about things that aren't dead. Kindred shows themselves when they reach the end of their ordained life. They don't give a fuck about Ryze, as his, let's call it a Life String, isn't at it's end. They do have a problem with those who try to extend/defy their Life String  when it is at their end, like a majority of Shadow Isle folk. \n\nOf course, this all relies on the idea of Destiny \"Your path isn't up yet\" yada yada, but that's entirely different conversation,","replies":[]},{"poster":"DragonShea","date":"2016-08-11T01:20:40.967+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"One of Ryze's quotes: \"When I have found them all, I'll fade away\" Means he is only staying alive to complete his task, maybe even let the ruining energies inside him go, turning him fully mortal again. So It's say both of them are gunning for him, if he outlasts the wolf, he will give himself gladly to the lamb.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheSlogs","date":"2016-08-09T15:30:43.627+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel like the turning point for Kindred's acceptance of someone is whether or not they accept Kindred, or death. It does not matter how long you live, it just matters that you accept your end when it comes. We know that Ryze puts his objective of saving the world from the World runes above saving the lives of people, so I would assume that so long as he accomplishes enough to satisfy himself, he will willingly accept his passing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BÃ¢rd","date":"2016-08-09T15:28:16.718+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kindred don't really give a shit about Ryze. To them, he is nothing special.\n\nHe doesn't run from his death; the power of the runes are elongating his lifespan.\n\nIt simply isn't his time to die yet.\n\nThe only things Kindred actually hate are the undead; they view them not only as abominations, but as an affront to their work.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GreenLore","date":"2016-08-09T10:19:41.002+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I doubt that Kindred would care about Ryze,I mean his lifespan is pretty much nothing to them.\n\nIllaoi would likely applaud ryze for his endurance,after all Ryze wants to save the world and he follows this path for millenia.\nMost other humans would have given up or stagnated.\n\nThough Illaoi would likely tell ryze to take a break now and then","replies":[]},{"poster":"Officer Zyra ","date":"2016-08-09T06:11:55.888+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i feel kindred has no fret with ryze seing how he isnt undead, just living a really long life.
