There is a long wait time between each Sheen proc that Riven simply just cannot wait for if she wants to combo. And if she combos while building triforce, she is missing out on a lot of potential damage she would have had if she built pure AD, CDR or Armor pen. \n\nAlso, it doesn't help that Riven already builds Black Cleaver, which already has all of those stats in addition to Rage for a unique passive, which wouldn't stack with Triforce.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AFilthyCaitMain","date":"2017-06-16T03:09:22.302+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"the mana is a wasted stat.
