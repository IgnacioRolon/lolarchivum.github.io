It is shocking just how powerful Mundo's sustain is even without his ult taken into the picture, but when you consider the fact that his ult heals himself for 5% of his max HP in a _second_ that is pretty damn huge (and not even taking into account the new mastery which increases that by a pretty damn massive amount, or the fact that mundo usually builds a spirit visage, which increases this even further) .  Generally even _with_ a {{item:3034}}  you probably aren't going to be doing more than 5% of mundo's health in a second.\n\nSo then, lets see if we can get a mathematical example in action here\n\nWe shall assume that Mundo is facing a relatively balanced team comp, and both are at level 18.  Also no consumables were used.\nCase 1 (with Lord Dominicks Regards, a.k.a. giant slayer):\n\n{{champion:236}} {{item:3036}} {{item:3031}} {{item:3006}} {{item:3508}} {{item:3812}} {{item:3046}} \n\nRunes that matter:  9x AD Marks, x3 attack speed quints\nMasteries that Matter:  Battering blows, Fury, Warlords Bloodlust, and bounty hunter with all 5 stacks (for this case lucian took feast instead of double edged sword)\n**We shall assume lucian is only autoattacking\n\nCouple assumptions that we shall make here, first bing that warlords bloodlust attack speed bonus is constant (it is not normally), and the second being that Lucian is critting 100% of the time.\n\n{{champion:36}} {{item:3065}} {{item:3143}} {{item:3742}} {{item:3047}} {{item:3075}} {{item:3512}} \n\nRunes that Matter:  x9 seals of armor, x3 quints of HP regen\nMasteries that Matter:  Unyielding, Tough Skin, Veterans Scars, Perseverance (we shall assume that mundo is not below 20% max health)\n\nLucian Total AD at 18:  100 + 65 + 40 + 65 + 65 + 8.5 = 343.5\nLucian Total attack speed:  [(0.56 + 0.20 + 0.14 + 0.30 + 0.40 + 0.04) x  0.638] + 0.638 = 1.68432\n\nTotal damage over 10 seconds:\n\n1.68432 x 10 x 343.5 x 2.5 + 1.68432 x 10 x 343.5 x 2.5 x (0.05 + .15) = 17356.9176\n\n\nMundo:\n\nTotal health:  2096 + 600 + 450 + 500 + [(2096 + 600 + 450 + 500) x .04] = 3791.84\n\nTotal health regeneration (with ult) over 10 seconds: (0.05 x 3791.84 x 10) + (20.5 + 8.1)  x  (1.5 + 0.5 + 1.25) x 2 + (20.5 + 8.1) x 2 + (0.003 x 3791.84) x 10 + [(0.05 x 3791.84 x 10) + (20.5 + 8.1)  x  (1.5 + 0.5 + 1.25) x 2 + (20.5 + 8.1) x 2 + (0.003 x 3791.84) x 10] x 0.20 = 3791.5128\n\nBase Armor:  86.4\n\nBonus Armor:  9 + 60 + 100 + 50 + 60 + 30 + (9 + 60 + 100 + 50 + 60 + 30) x 0.06 = 263.94\n\nTotal Effective Armor:  86.4 + 263.94 - (263.94 x .40) - (86.4 + 263.94) x 0.07 = 220.2402\n\nDamage multiplier to lucian:  100 / (100 + 220.2402) = 0.312265606\n\nTotal Damage received by mundo:   [(17356.9176 - 2) - (17356.9176 - 2) x .10] x 0.312265606 = 4877.409475\n\nTotal Damage done to Mundo accounting for regeneration:  4877.409475 - 3791.5128 = **1085.896675** (this is the damage that \"sticks\")\n\n\n\n\nNow then, let us take that same exact setup, and with Mortal reminder (A.K.A. executioners calling)  instead of Lord Dominicks Regards:\n\n\nLucian's Damage:  1.68432 x 10 x 343.5 x 2.5 + 1.68432 x 10 x 343.5 x 0.05 x 2.5 = 15187.3029 BEFORE RESISTANCES\n\nMundo's Total health regeneration over 10 seconds:  3791.5128 - 3791.5128 x .40 = 2274.90768\n\nTotal Damage recieved by mundo:  [(15187.3029 - 2) - (15187.3029 - 2) x .10] x 0.312265606 = 4267.663031\n\nTotal damage done to mundo accounting for regeneration: 4267.663031 - 2274.90768 = **1992.755351**\n\n\nYou can see that you are technically dealing more damage with {{item:3036}}  but after accounting for Mundo's rather insane sustain you can clearly see that {{item:3033}}  wins the day.\n\n**Small edit:  Please, if you spot any math errors, let me know (extra kudos if you fix them for me lol), math while sleep deprived generally doesn't mix xD\n\n\nTLDR:  Executioners Calling ( {{item:3123}} ) is **_significantly_** more effective at countering {{champion:36}} than Giant Slayer {{item:3034}} ).","replies":[]},{"poster":"LeeDark","date":"2015-11-19T06:11:06.027+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not just Mundo, though.

The problem is this:\n\n* Midgame:  {{item:3508}} {{item:3006}}  {{item:3087}}, you aint going to kill tanks with that build. ER is just a must so adc's want to build it to kill squishies\n* Midgame later: {{item:3508}} {{item:3006}} {{item:3087}} {{item:3031}} it start to become easyer. IE is decent against Mundo.\n* Lategame:  {{item:3508}} {{item:3006}}  {{item:3087}} {{item:3031}}{{item:3033}} mundo can be killed pretty easy\n\nHere's the problem: Games never reach the lategame. In the phase the game is going now. You really have to build {{item:3123}} sooner. It only cost 800 gold. You should get it before IE. You won't be able to kill him fast but you still can kill him.\n\nBut what's the issue, it's just a lot easyer to just ignite the Mundo. That's why you don't see a lot of people actualy build it. This makes {{item:3036}} just better on them despite the GW on {{item:3033}}.\n\nNow with the Crit mastery hotfix we will finaly see {{item:3153}} again & that will have a big effect on mundo players. The reason why we didn't saw it before is that adc's litterly used crit as replacement for lifesteal. Now they can't do that anymore.\n\nThe patch is out, just test it again.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RyzeRework","date":"2015-11-19T14:59:36.502+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i just love how everyones complaining saying the new exe is ganna be op and mundo has a high winrate","replies":[]},{"poster":"Need Gold 4 Tent","date":"2015-11-19T12:00:42.705+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's because Mundo (in their opinion) doesn't really \"kill\" people.
