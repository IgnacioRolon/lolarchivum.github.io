Ranger's allows me to power farm and still be super healthy when gank opportunities arise.  I almost always go with the {{item:3725}} , although I do believe that {{item:3724}} is a valid enchantment as well if you know how to play Amumu as a mage.\n\nAfter that my build depends on what kind of a team I'm against and how the game is going.\n\nIf the team is full AD I build: {{item:3117}} /{{item:3047}}  - {{item:3143}} -{{item:3110}} {{item:3075}} where the last item is dependent on whether I need more tankiness, more cdr, or some raw damage.  Typically it will be down to the following items: {{item:3083}} {{item:3116}} {{item:3151}} {{item:3190}} {{item:3800}}.\n\nIf the team I'm against is more hybrid damage that my build looks more like the following: {{item:3117}} /{{item:3111}}  - {{item:3001}} -{{item:3110}} -{{item:3190}} - with the final item once again being dependent on what the team actually looks like.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MrBuffington","date":"2015-04-09T18:39:56.372+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Try Probuilds.com, I typically have found good advice there. Pros will build different things to fit their situations, though, but it's great for getting a general idea of what kinds of things you want to build.\n\nI would take Ranger's; his Q has much longer range than chilling smite and is more powerful CC anyways, plus Amumu tends to have mana issues, and Rangers really helps him sustain in jungle. I would build cinderhulk pretty much always; sunfire cape was an amazing item on Amumu, and now you get it for free with your jungle item. The only time I'd build Magus is if I'm just having fun and going full AP, though if you're really good with Amumu and know how to survive fights and stuff, it's another possibility.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DwarvenGiant","date":"2015-04-09T13:56:04.077+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Usually, I see people go for a build made out of 3 or more AP items, excluding boots.\n\nThough, while his damage is awesome with AP (and I will always run full AP for fun less serious games, especially in U.R.F- No really, you should try that in U.R.F!), I think that his tankiness is really important.\n\nIf things go decent or even bad, I'd stick with {{item:3713}}, and then upgrade to  {{item:3725}},  and then {{item:1001}} upgrade is situational- If their team has a lot of physical damage and/or their AD Champ/s are doing a little too good and are becoming a threat, I'd pick {{item:3047}}, if it's an enemy team with a lot of CC and/or is heavy-AP and/or they have champs that are becoming a threat and deal a lot of magic damage, this would be the choice {{item:3111}}.\nI'd go {{item:3117}}  only if I'm doing really good (early especially).\n\nItemization from there depends on situations like the ones mentioned in the boots section. But remember not to be tempted so easily and pick up too many AP items very quickly (even if I list a few AP items in different sections below) and remember that you can still mix items from the different sections.\n\nAre the enemies magic damage-based mostly? Pick a few of these up: {{item:3102}} {{item:3190}} {{item:3065}} {{item:3001}}  {{item:3174}} \n\nDo the enemies deal a lot of physical damage? Take these: {{item:3143}} {{item:3110}} {{item:3075}} \n\nWant to simply deal some more damage and wreck your enemies? You'd like these: {{item:3001}} {{item:3157}} {{item:3116}} {{item:3027}} {{item:3151}} {{item:3089}} {{item:3285}} {{item:3023}} {{item:3174}} \n\n\nSome more fun items that I wasn't sure where to list (either because I think they're silly or don't belong to any of the 3 sections): {{item:3025}}  {{item:3083}} {{item:3800}} {{item:3512}} {{item:3026}} {{item:3056}} {{item:3060}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Syn Zykan","date":"2015-04-09T08:46:54.721+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{item:3724}} {{item:3151}} {{item:3157}} {{item:3001}} {{item:3110}} {{item:3255}} magemumu too strong O:\n(just don't miss Q and make sure your mid doesn't mind you monopolizing blue buff)\n\nBuild gives you max cdr, decent AP and plenty of m.pen along with defensive stats for when you dive in. my fave personal amumu build for sure ^_^","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheRakkun","date":"2015-04-07T17:49:41.653+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Generally what you want is situation.\nYou generally want {{item:3110}} if you're doing well and need mana, however if they have very powerful ADC's you might want {{item:3143}} \n{{item:3713}} is generally the way to go for smite.\nWhen it comes to offensive items you want either a {{item:3001}} if your team has a lot of magic damage or {{item:3151}} if they're mostly AD.\nA {{item:3116}} always helps because it gives you health and CC\n{{item:3157}} and {{item:3102}} are good when against bursters, Banshees for Magic damage, Zhonyas for PD","replies":[]},{"poster":"R110","date":"2015-04-07T17:46:18.175+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would avoid building mana unless it's {{item:3110}} but since you're building cinderhulk it's probably more benificial to get a {{item:3143}} instead to benefit from Cinderhulk's 25% bonus health amp.\nAnother way to build Amumu is a heavy AP build with Magus enchantment recommended for more experienced Amumu players that want to snowball an early lead.\nUsefull items for both builds can be {{item:3001}} and {{item:3116}} as they increase your damage output, tankiness and utility. Amumu's damage is basically fully within the aura's range and Rylai's gives a permaslow with W active.\n\nFor guides in general I would recommend the featured guides on solomid.net, make sure the guide is not too outdated though.","replies":[]}]}
