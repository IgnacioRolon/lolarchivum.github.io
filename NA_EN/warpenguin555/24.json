It's just fucking pathetic how no innovation ever happens in this game in terms of playstyle at the pro level until it's been seen in Bronze play (mind you playing it like shit) and then adapted to being used in challenger then into pro play. Bronze players are some of the most innovative players in the game because they're willing to try shit out, maybe it don't work for them because their mechanics suck (individually and team-wide) but they are almost always the ones logically coming up with these new strats, I'm not even kidding.","replies":[{"poster":"Thryale","date":"2017-10-07T06:49:36.933+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"agreed. I remember back in late S2 early S3 I asked why we don't send duo lanes top and solo lanes bot to a friend of mine (he was plat/diamond rank and I was high bronze low silver) and he told me it was stupid and there is no reason to do that. then 6-9 months later, guess what all the pros were doin? lane swaps! lane swaps everywhere!\n\nEDIT: but yeah, I think I understand why innovation is lacking in high ranks. it's because they prefer stability. they want to focus and hone their skills, and in a tumultuous environment with a lot of innovations means they have to relearn things constantly. If everything stays the same, you can come to expect certain things from your opponent, and if you know what your opponent is going to do, it makes it easier to plan your course of action and easier to guarantee a win based upon how well you execute your own plays.\n\nInnovation introduces variables that can't always be taken into consideration, and thus the stability is shaken. Innovation is easy, adapting to that innovation is very, very hard.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Martyrofsand","date":"2017-10-08T18:22:43.707+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=D30PX10TG8VL2R9X,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=0pf3dJEl,comment-id=0001000000020000000000000000,timestamp=2017-10-07T06:29:13.645+0000)\n \n> Truly though and I don&#x27;t know why none of these fucking noobs havn&#x27;t done it yet is move a mage to bot lane to abuse the marksman all lane phase and put the marksman top/mid with a tank top/mid. \n\n\n\nThey haven't done that because mages tend to bully ADCs based off of a level advantage that they won't get in a 2v2 lane, and if a mage tries to 2v1 the support/adc duo will ruin them if they are in anyway decent.  \n\nIf you have trouble seeing that just look at Lucien/Varus/Corki when they have gone mid lane in various seasons, this one included.  They tend to bully those lanes and push/roam hard.  Putting a mage bot lane simply isn't going to make it work.\n\nAs for putting an ADC top lane a few can work there, Graves/Vayne have done ok for example but the biggest issue is if you put an ADC top against say Riven/Irelia/Wukong/Fiora/etc you are in for a very rough time as they will get on you very easily and blow you up.  I had one game I was actually forced to go top lane as varus, because my team was throwing fits in champ select, and against a Wukong he hit 6 E+Q+R on me and I was dead before I hit the ground.
