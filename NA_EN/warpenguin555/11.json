Does it take longer when you hit gold or are they just not being sent out yet? I know I didn't do anything to get disqualified from getting them. Sorry if I come off as a dick, thats not intended, it's just that the last 3 years I got my Bronze and Silver rewards right away but I haven't got my cooler gold rewards yet.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-11-09T23:48:44.621+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Season rewards haven't been sent out yet for anyone.  We'll be keeping updates on the [helpdesk ](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-support/W0aEONuP-2017-ranked-rewards-help-desk)thread, but hang tight.  It sounds like you were fortunte to get yours pretty quickly in the past, but there are a lot of players eligible for rewards, so it may be a bit to get it all done.","replies":[]}]}
