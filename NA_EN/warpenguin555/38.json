Look where Katarina is now..borderline useless. Guess that's what happens RIot listens to the  crying of a community where 80% are silver or Bronze.\n\nKat was actually strong before the nerfs, though. Even now, she isn't as easy to counter as she seems. Yes, she is easy to counter during the lane phase, but it requires a great amount of team coordination to stop her because she will roam, she will get kills, she will snowball and she will have the potential to destroy on teamfights. Team coordiation is something that is incredibly difficult to have on SoloQ, especially on lower elos.\n\nThis isn't to say that Kat is not balanced, just that calling other \"low elo kids\" because Kat has been nerfed is not fair.\n\nTake {{champion:268}} for example, he has been the reverse of Katarina. Balanced at lower elos, but incredibly OP on very high elo and at competitive play. Just because he has been nerfed for that part of game, does that mean that we have the right to insult high elos for that?\n\nRiot has already explained that they will try to make every champion balanced for all elos.","replies":[{"poster":"The Bíg Ticket","date":"2016-02-23T00:09:53.832+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"What makes more sense, balancing for the game played at its highest level or for people who don't understand the game?
