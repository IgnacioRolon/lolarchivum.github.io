If we were to do something like this, we'd probably want to actually improve the gameplay behind the spell as well. Not sure how this suggestion really leads to that outcome, but maybe you have some ideas? I would probably do well to start by thinking \"what could extra spheres allow me to do that more damage wouldn't?\".","replies":[{"poster":"Poske","date":"2015-08-13T12:02:27.184+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"As someone who was one shoting just by pressing r with syndra from 100>0 \n\nDo not buff syndra she is balanced even outclasses few midlaners","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ashenvall","date":"2015-08-13T16:56:48.720+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"At each syndra's spells or (only dark sphere) hit an ennemy champion all CD are refreshed of X seconds (except ultimate......)\n\nor\n\nPassive grow up with spells'level, not at level 5\nor/and\nPassive buff every spells, examples : dark sphere +X% damage +X range + X% sphere's duration + X area ( maybe nerf at this point, it'll begin to become too \"op\" ......)\n\nor\n\nAdd movement speed if dark sphere hit ennemy (like Ahri's illusion sphere maybe) during X seconds\n\nor\n\nulti will become single targeted area => same ulti but when balls land around the target's area, balls deal damage(not much) at each ennemy present in the area effect. \n\nor\n\ndark sphere will detonate after 6 seconds and deal damage in area effect.

If you do Syndra's standard combo of QE on a target, W to drop something on them, then ult to finish it off... Then there's a bunch of balls just sitting there on the ground, and they don't **do anything**. This should be Syndra's high point, and now she's got more balls than she can ever get without her ult!
