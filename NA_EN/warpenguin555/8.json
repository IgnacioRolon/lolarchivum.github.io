I was messing with my resolution settings in game and the window size settings to try to get things back close to the way they were on my old computer. Somewhere along the line my client started to bug out. It cramps into a tiny box when a game finishes. I can't honor or do anything, I can't even log out properly, I have to use task manager to force close league. I know I can fix it by going back to the original settings, but that's incredibly annoying since everything feels too tiny. Is there a way to fix this or at least work around it while not having to go back to the defaults?\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/A7cP7\nAttached a screenshot of the bug too.

Stopped playing for 2 months and thought this was a bug that'll eventually be fixed and that I wasn't the only one with this bug. finally after months and months of waiting such a simple fix within navigating files to fix this issue.
