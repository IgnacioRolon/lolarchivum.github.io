This is why we passed on swain for the Mage update. Swain needs work but probably more then one ability with minor art changes can solve.\n\nMorde didn't get just \"minor\" ability tweaks though. You took away his armor and MR on W, you made it so that he can only cast W (for combat shield and damage) if there is something allied near him, and you lowered his movement speed much below a normal juggernaut.\n\nThen to top it off because you wanted to be able to reward him for being able to build tanky, you gave him really poor starting stats, and lowered his damage unless he built damage. Besides Sona, Morde currently feels like the squishiest champ I play (until I get tank items), but unless I build damage, I don't have any. Again, this is partially because of his scaling, but also partially because I can't self cast W. When I can fight with W the fight doesn't feel completely helpless.  \n\nEvery step of the way you guys asked how much W actually effected lane. There were morde's like myself who did max W in lane.\n\nOntop of that, you also pigeon holed into a lane that noone wanted him in. Was he playable in botlane? Yes. Were players able to support him? No. \n\nWhy were people not able to support him?\n\n1) Meta sheep, qq we are never going to win qq. \n2) He is squishy early game. \n3) No mobility, low move speed, no cc, needs teammate within 3 teemos to successfully use w.

Morde players before the update were used to going in and relying on using aoe damage to get his shield up, and using W to keep his shield up in between Q and E. \n\nNow in comparison you are required to build health to get a larger shield. If you build health and tank you get no more than a {{item:3116}} {{item:3157}} which is 200 ap. With the rest of your items comprising of {{boots}} with a combination of anything that can give you armor, magic resist, and health. (Being that nuke mage and nuke ad don't work well on him) \n__________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJust to go through a standard fight. \n\nStarting with Q, Your Q counts as an auto attack/ spell, I've noticed that off of the first two hits you only get the magic damage in shield, and then the third one doesn't apply on hit effects (like hydra) but you get the full 3rd hit in shield. \n\n(Assuming 200 ap) That shield from Q is roughly 200 damage in shielding. (25% of low damage means almost no shield.)\n\nW, is only usable alone for the quick double cast, again unless a teammate is nearby, which is when Morde feels (most) balanced. If you were to hit 4 enemy's with Morde's W, which is again when he feels best, with only 200 ap it hits for 1000 damage. 25% of 1k is a 250 damage in shielding, which if you hit 3 minions and 1 champion you get 312 HP in healing. (Which is a nice bonus)\n\nBut here is the problem with both of those abilities, Q while giving you higher damage is almost impossible to get off without the use of flash (Slow base speed, combo'd with possibly only a rylis) and then it blocks almost no damage, while dealing minimal damage. Meanwhile W Deals a good chunk of AOE damage, but in anything but an optimaly large block of enemies gives almost no real shielding. In other words on a tank build, with these two items, you get roughly 712 bonus health of shielding from these two skills. \n\nNow here is where the real bread and butter comes into play. E gives (with 200 ap) ~ 68 shield, and if it is an enemy champion it gives another 250 (since a full hp build with the two items mentioned above gives roughly 1000 possible shield) \n\nThat means that if you hit an enemy with everything but your ulti, you get a whopping 718 shield with 312hp, making your total bonus hp 1030.\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________\n\nNow ignoring his ulti, all of that sounds super great! You have roughly 5k HP, with a good chunk of armor, and magic resist, but here is where the real downfall hits. All of your stuff is down for at least 5 seconds. You have no way of chasing, no way of running, and even if they are within melee range, you have no ability to do anything but auto attack and wait for cool downs. \n\nCurrently a standard ADC (full crit, with mortal reminder) deals ~500 or more damage per hit at 2 hits per second. That is 1000 damage per second. Just standing there you have 10 auto attacks to live through while you have no option other to stand there and take their damage. Which is if anyone can do the math, 5000 damage. On top of that, if they hit you with mortal reminder first, there goes some of that nice healing you got.\n\nAll of that above was with better than a 1v1 scenario. You hit minions with your W to get a larger shield, and with building juggernaut you did a whopping 1400-1500 damage in one full combo (not enough to kill someone). That is also only IF, **IF** you hit your third Q. So to kill them you have to manage to live through that  5 second window to get another full cast off, and if you live it was probably only because the enemy got worried about you killing them and ran away, just to reengage. \n_____________________________________________________________________________________\n\nNow what happened differently with old morde? Well, unless they had a dash, you used W to kite them and slow them down (with rylis), by staying as close to them as you possibly could. What happens now? You try to kite with E, and you never get back in range of W. \n\nI really think you underestimated how much having a solo W was worth in fights. I actually kind of wonder why you don't allow morde to have his (fully) solo cast W back, because between his higher base movement speed, his Q bouncing mechanic, and his aoe W he was better able to keep up with the enemy, or even just solo clear things and objectives. \n\nInstead of removing some of his flaws, you just made them worse, and then added new ones on top of it. Honestly, if you wanted him to be in a good spot right now, you would allow him to have a higher base movement speed, and a fully self casting W. His aoe damage on W allows him to stay in trades longer, and a slightly higher movement speed would make him more reliable to get his third strike off. It wouldn't be quite as feast or famine.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Dunkrius2g","date":"2016-03-20T22:53:19.054+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"So Darius was a success?","replies":[{"poster":"AvatarRoku22","date":"2016-03-21T04:41:12.260+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"indeed","replies":[]},{"poster":"Spaceman5pff","date":"2016-03-21T03:55:25.356+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd say so.\nHe is much easier to counterplay in lane now, and has a much more satisfying teamfighting pattern.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Photos of Ghosts","date":"2016-03-21T12:25:49.042+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can build armor.

The only problem was that he was **massively** overbuffed when they released him because the PBE consists of…. yea I'm not going to go over that can of worms. Skarner is currently enjoying a nice 52% avg win rate in Plat. to Challenger. (Dem sources: https://champion.gg/champion/Skarner ). Despite having a rough start at first, he is MUCH better then before the Juggernaught update where he was complete garbo ever since they nerfed Cinderhulk the 1st time around. Yes, he has a somewhat gimmicky mini-game which irked many people, but you soon realize that you become the king of the Jg when you and your team have control of a spire. You instantly become Sanic and feel like you have a Trinity force with the atk. speed buff the spire gives you. This is not including the vision it gives you when you cap it which is a really nice playing Skarner. I could go on and on how the rework was what Skarner needed (and yes it did have some problems, but then again nothing is perfect).\n\nI cannot stay the same for Mordekaiser however and that was just more then just messing with how Mordekaiser was played. It was also poor insight with the following of the Marksmen reworks, and how they attempted to make a Melee caster ADC viable right before they literally **supercharged** the ADC's that Morde had to contend with. \n\nWith this \"VGU\" group, I'm willing to bet money that Skarner will not be looked at again this season with the intention of seriously reworking him. With Morde I'm less certain because of the mess they made with him. I believe that its up to the community, and how much of an uproar they make. Best case scenario is they will look at him again during the mage rework and change him a bit.","replies":[]}]}
