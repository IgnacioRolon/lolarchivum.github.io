Our Karthus was sitting in the pixel brush waiting for us to funnel them to him, he pops his AoE and Wall, slowing the entire team as the teamfight erupts on top of Karthus.  He dies, his passive pops, and he starts channeling his Ult. As Hecarim, I ran around the Karthus AoE, ulted 3 enemies back into the Karthus AoE when they flashed out.  The rest of my team got destroyed, but as the Karthus Ult finished he killed all but the enemy Caitlyn, who 90 caliber netted out of the Kartus AoE, surviving with 300 health.
