Then they proceed to farm the 15 minions anyways.  And probably take your turret.  Turret farming isn't hard.  melee minions can take 2 turret shots and one auto finishes them.  Caster minions if you hit them once, let the turret hit them second, your third hit drops them.  I'm horrible at farming in the middle of the  lane because the minions mess up my timing early on.....but when i'm pushed to my turret  I know how to get that money.  If I'm gonna lose my lane I'd rather lose it as sloooooowly as possible.  Not gonna give them in 5 minutes what I could have drug out for 15 minutes by just refusing to fight them and scavenging minions.  It's not an exciting existence, but it gives your team at least time to gank the person.  If you keep trying to fight the person, getting rekt, then sitting under your turret with no health pinging for ganks trying to farm.......you're just making life hard on yourself.  buy a bunch of pots....stand under the turret...avoid all the damage you can....and last hit minions.\n\n  The thing about only being down by farm is mid and late game....minions flow freely....jungle camps are for the taking.  You can catch back up.  And I'm sorry but nobody in lane gets so strong that they can just poke you twice and kill you unless you are just refusing to itemize against them or you are very bad at keeping out of range. Some people get in a losing lane and keep building damage when they're already way behind.  Much more effective to play it safe till your tower falls then ward and roam and see if you have better luck killing other people. Even if they are doing some LCS style farming 15 minutes in they might have about 150 minions.  If your mid adc or jungler are farming even remotely well.....enemy top lane isn't gonna really be much richer than any of them.  Especially if they managed to pick up a few kills elsewhere. It's feeding them that makes them all of a sudden OP and getting doubles when your jungler finally makes it to gank your lane.\n\n  I try not to die more than 5 times a game.  top 6 chars I play....most deaths I average is 5.3.  On a support at that.  If only I got teammates that hated dying as much as I do.  It would be easier for me to climb.  Not saying I don't have games where I die 10 times but those are few and far between.  My teammates frequently have 15-20 deaths.  Even when I win sometimes.

I played shaco top against a Jax last night.  The Jax ended up 20-21-xx.  I murdered him in lane.  He never built a drop of magic resis or hp in lane.  I went 14/5/20.  He got more kills than me but died 4 times as much.  Had he bought one single MR item first, he probably could have won because late game he was stompin my ass when I tried to fight him and our Leblanc was like 27/6/13.  That one early magic resis item would have stopped half the kills I got on him, and half the kills leblanc got on him.  Instead he kept building his attack speed, lifesteal, and AD.  Late game he was strong asf and nobody could solo him, but it didn't matter.  Me and LB could two shot anyone on their team.  People need to learn to itemize based on their matchup and how its going or may go instead of running the same runes, masteries, and items regardless of who their lane opponent is.   If you die more than once to your lane opponent and you don't buy a defensive item you are trolling yourself and your team.","replies":[{"poster":"LordGeovanni","date":"2015-10-21T04:54:03.121+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i favor jax as a life steal tank with mix damage my only offensive items are {{item:3124}}  {{item:3078}}  and {{item:3146}}  built in that order with {{item:1315}}  {{item:3065}}  and a situational armor item {{item:3075}}  {{item:3143}}  {{item:3742}}","replies":[{"poster":"Clown Apocalypse","date":"2015-10-21T05:14:57.799+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"see he built {{item:3153}} {{item:3074}} {{item:3078}} {{item:3072}} and I forget what else to finish I think maybe a rage blade.  he was strong as shit late game but I we got fed off of him","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Abyssphere","date":"2015-10-19T14:20:01.698+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=LordGeovanni,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=NEjdc9lx,comment-id=00050000,timestamp=2015-10-19T05:14:02.977+0000)\n>\n> ah but when you become so passive in your lane especially top lane that you just let the enemy farm that he beats you in lane after first back they usually come back so strong that you cant even leave from under your tower and that after they poke you twice you they can dive you under your tower and you sill end up feeding those kills. if you see a laner gettingin problem and dieing 2-3 time for nothing in lane it would be in everyones best intrest to get as many guys as possible and gank the fed person\n\nIt depends what you do to stay alive. If you need to play super passive to the point of losing farm and being bullied out to avoid dying then it's a slow, inevitable loss, but there's no reason you shouldn't be the one outfarming the enemy laner either.
