However, in the case of 4, RIOT also must FORCE people to go solo. I mean that is bs. 1 man has to play \"solo\" with 4 random players in a NOT SOLOQ gamemode.\n\nMy other arguement is what happens if 3-4 premades climb it to a certain rather high division. That is nice and I don't wanna take away their fun. BUT what happens if they separate? 1 man who only played with his premade wanna go, you know good ol' SOLOQ style, alone. Will he be really as a good as that division? I don't think so. Why is that? Because soloQ is not just about skill and knowing your role in team. NONO. \nYou also have to adapt and conform if needed. And that is why soloQ so exciting imo. However, I don't know how RIOT gonna solve it\n-----Theory ofc,I have no proof what will happen.\n\nMany people \"cry\" about 4 men harrassing the 5th player also. Yeah, I understand that there will be cases where they will be nice. BUT I think RIOT has to understand there will be bad ones too. Mainly in lower division I guess. I am not saying this, because I just can't take any harassment. I am perfectly fine if one random dude trashtalking in soloQ, I get over it. However if my entire team gonna flame me.... that is just disgusting.\n\ntl;dr  \"PURE\" SOLOQ\nor DYNAMIC without 4-1 teams\nor if really necessary to do it with 4-1 teams, make more severe punishment for premades, like 1 of their member chatbanned, all of them chatbanned.

I havent seen a troll in ages and this new system will keep it that way since there will be no more champ select hostages since they will almost always get their preferred role and if they don't go to their assigned role it is iirc a bannable or at least temp ban offense if it is done multiple times.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Zarkkast","date":"2015-11-04T19:33:03.952+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, cause the chance of getting 4 people fully dedicated to ruin one person's game is a lot bigger than the chance of getting multiple one persons trolling every single game.\n\nMost of the time when you get in a 4-premade you are lucky. The four are in a team, your chances of winning are bigger. Not gonna deny the existence of group trolls, but they're A LOT less frequent than solo trolls, which you can get multiples in one single game. Solo trolls ruin nearly every game, at least in lower elo. Premade trolls are an extreme nuisance, but a rare one at that.","replies":[{"poster":"My Waifu Vanilla","date":"2015-11-04T21:30:44.115+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Like I said earlier the chances of you getting stuck in the 4 man premade is already low and the chance they are all going to troll just to mess with you and lose their OWN LP is even lower. The chances are so stacked against it and if anything Riot should just make an option to have a genuine solo queue via check box before you queue (not like it will change your solo queue time but may sort of increase group but they should know that going in).","replies":[]}]}]}
