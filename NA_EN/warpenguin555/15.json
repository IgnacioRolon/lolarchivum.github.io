We feel we haven't been communicating as much as we could recently. I'm currently working on a bigger \"State of Champion Update\" Devblog that should go out later this month that should go into much more details about past, current and upcoming champion update projects.

When he was first released he was incredibly overpowered, which was an immediate turn off for me since I don't like to play OP champions.  \n\nNow he is too weak early-mid game to actually have kill pressure, which makes his laning phase INCREDIBLY BORING. Before the rework, I would play around my level 6, because I knew if i could get my opponent into a good position i would be able to time my Voidlings with my R and E to get a kill. Now that just isn't the case, the only way to get a kill early game is if the enemy is dumb enough to stand there and let Voidlings attack them for 15+ seconds. His ult actually had more counterplay before his rework to be honest, which created interesting match-ups. \n\nHe was turned from a DoT zone mage into a hardcore pushing suppress bot mage, which is not what I wanted in his rework. I wanted more emphasis on his unique DoT mage status as well as his Voidling mechanic, less emphasis on his crazy pushing power which I always thought was the root of what made him seem unviable in the meta. The current Voidling mechanic is cool in theory, but in practice it is either too strong or too weak. The same with his Passive, its either too strong or too weak. With the recent nerfs Malz is just too weak compared to old Malzahar, he even has less counterplay than before the only reason its not apparent is because of how safe he has to play now.  \n\nNow late game its back to the OP no counterplay Malz of click 3 buttons and watch them die, which I thought we wanted to fix. This is a double issue, not only does he rarely make it to late game status in time to impact the game, but when he does make it, there is very little you can do about him.  \n\nSo to me they looked at his issues and focused on only 1 of them, his damage, and fixed that. They left all the old issues, which were than exacerbated by his new mechanics, and realized he was too strong. So here he is, nerfed pretty hard, and not fun to play anymore thanks to his super boring laning phase and ridiculous late game.  \n\nI would like to see the Passive removed, right now its useless against anyone who understands his kit, since they can just AA you before using their CC and boom you might as well not even have the passive. Once that is gone I think it will free up a lot of strength that can be spread throughout his kit. I think his Voidlings are too strong and too situational, I would be glad to reduce their overall power and make them more reliable. His E and R feel weak, just so very weak. They need to be stronger, since they were and are his only form of reliable damage. Take some power from his late game and move it to his laning phase, this is where he needs it to be honest, he needs some power to back up that stupid strong pushing power he has.  \n\nBasically get rid of this boring laid back farming laning phase and give him back his strong DoT zoning mage status in the lane. Allow him to actually pressure his lane opponent, instead of constantly being in fear of a gank even when the enemy laner is gone.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"dapositiveviking","date":"2016-08-13T00:05:16.065+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Reav3,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=hddJVEM2,comment-id=0008000000010000,timestamp=2016-08-12T23:06:47.128+0000)\n>\n>  diffidently \n\n\nhttp://i0.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/017/753/doug_dimmadone_owner_of_the_dimmsdale_dimmadone.jpg","replies":[{"poster":"Reav3","date":"2016-08-13T00:08:32.776+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"edited, thx!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Star PlatinumELO","date":"2016-08-16T01:56:47.209+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"when you say the past, will be able to hear all about our boy morde and the failure surrounding his rework?","replies":[{"poster":"Reav3","date":"2016-08-16T16:36:37.896+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, though there have already been DevCorver posts from the designers doing a Morde Retro.
