Bear in mind, I'm not saying you need to like it. Everyone has their own hang-ups and feelings, which we all understand. What I do need to say is that someone liking the new lore doesn't make them an SJW crusader or a bastion of whatever political ideology you think they stand for.  The flipside is true too: Someone disliking the new lore does not make them some /b/ reject who wants to see everyone who isn't them exploded in a fiery cataclysm. The moment we jump to extremes is the moment this loses the point of being about the new lore and becomes a thinly veiled political bashing thread.\n\nI and the other moderators know how strongly people can feel about this and how difficult it can be to divorce politics, personal feelings and hang-ups about these topics. Yet despite this, we have to remember that Varus is a fictional video game character owned by Riot Game(s). They're technically free to do what they wish with said character. Does that mean we always have to blindly sing their praises? Of course not. But that doesn't mean Riot putting in this type of character is a free pass to put your personal thoughts on such topics in a thread.\n\nYou can be upset at the new lore and it doesn't make you hate LGBTQ people.\n\nYou can be happy with the new lore and it doesn't make you an SJW.\n\nJust please remember to be respectful guys.

Then why did Riot make Vaurs's story so problematic in the first place? I am pretty sure that they knew beforehand, that making Varus love another man would bring a lot of homophobia into the game, and regardless Riot proceeded with publishing this story because they want to be open minded and raise awareness.

I just get a vibe that a country that prides itself in conquering and  with the soldiers being as tough and cold-hearted as possible. I can't really see homosexuality being accepted there. It's obviously accepted in Ionia. I get the feeling the people of bilgewater and zaun wouldn't care as both nation/areas are already kind of lawless and everyone kinda has their own agenda. Demacia on the other hand I am unsure about. I feel like they wouldn't care but I'm not sure about that. Piltover, from my perspective, i think it isn't accepted. The main reason I say this lies in the ziggs story. The apparent hatred for yordles in piltover kinda shows a hate for difference, plus Piltover people are largely considered to be proper, so based off of these two things, I can't see it being accepted.","replies":[{"poster":"Emissary of Rain","date":"2017-12-01T07:37:38.336+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"From what we know of Noxus I'd say that homosexuality would probably be fine there.

If I remember correctly, in Veigars (old, they already gave him some short bio update) lore he was abused by yordle racists. Pretty dark story, he got insane and turned evil as the result. I could imagine a champion being raped, for the sake of the story. Not anymore tho, I feel like Riot wants to remove those dark features in their storys because they want League to be more \"friendly\" in terms of violence and brutality.\n\nAnd those questions are pretty legit, its the reason lore exists in the first place, to make Runeterra and their inhabitants interesting\n{{sticker:galio-happy}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ForeverKnight","date":"2017-12-01T08:34:14.925+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"new lore is so lame, i liked his old lore. this one feels forced and a waste of character lore.","replies":[{"poster":"Vekkna","date":"2017-12-01T16:36:32.311+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"What do you mean by \"forced?\"","replies":[{"poster":"69469238DEL1","date":"2017-12-01T17:44:32.104+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"They shoed in a random love story when his original story was about honor and vengeance","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"HalcyonDweller","date":"2017-12-01T00:03:32.460+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":20,"body":"I agree, however there is a flip side, complaining about the lore change solely because a champion is gay is certainly homophobic.

After all in the better lore his family took a primary role. So having a problem with that, even if i don't, does not make someone homophobic, if we were discussing riot making someone not canonically straight into a gay champion, like say Yasuo or Vi, i'd agree that people saying that were homophobes. Not in this context though.","replies":[{"poster":"HalcyonDweller","date":"2017-12-01T18:11:22.205+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Captain Marvelous said it better than me in his pinned comment on this thread.\n\nIt comes down to the fact that some people used this as an excuse to spew their disapproval of gayness in general, and to dismiss and silence people who disagreed with them by calling them SJWs.","replies":[{"poster":"MontethePython","date":"2017-12-02T10:00:02.979+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=HalcyonDweller,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=UEuiYj63,comment-id=000600010000,timestamp=2017-12-01T18:11:22.205+0000)\n>\n> Captain Marvelous said it better than me in his pinned comment on this thread.\n> \n> It comes down to the fact that some people used this as an excuse to spew their disapproval of gayness in general, and to dismiss and silence people who disagreed with them by calling them SJWs.\n\nThe majority isn't, and the main problem in these sort of arguements in my opinion is that no matter which side you're on someone will be branding you or your point of view with some buzzword they use incorrectly to slander you if you disagree, like people who like the new Varus lore calling dissenters Homophobes, and others who hate the new lore calling defenders of it SJWs. \n\nBottom line though, I'm impressed with how little of that i'm seeing, but still, it'd be nice to have a civil and logical discussion all around just once no matter if people disagree.

Fair points. There's basically 6 groups:\n\n1. People who like the new lore\n2. People who hate the new lore\n3. People who are somewhere in between\n4. People who don't care one way or the other about the new lore\n5. People who like the new lore and call people who hate it homophobes\n6. People who hate the new lore and call people who like it SJWs\n\nIt's true that there are not many in the last two groups, but the few that were there needed to be put in their places and reminded that such behavior was stupid.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Çhåryzård","date":"2017-12-01T05:34:54.692+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"Varus isn't even gay.\n\nVarus is a darkin.\n\nThe two hunters he used to create a single body for himself were gay.\n\nHe himself is not gay.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BlakexEkalb","date":"2017-11-30T23:55:31.855+0000","up_votes":20,"down_votes":16,"body":"Does it matter to the least?

The problem is that they retconned established lore to turn a character with a very defined set of motivations and story purely to serve as a token gay character.  If taric or ezreal were revealed to be gay it'd be different, because they didn't have established lore that would contradict that.  Nothing is added to varus' story by making him gay. The varus changes felt forced and inorganic because it was tacked onto his name. Additionally, telling more story through cinematics is a chance to see the character's personality in full display. Get Jinxed was about Jinx's wild nature, lust for destruction, and to build hype for her release. The Curse of the Sad Mummy was about the inner torment that causes Ammumu's crying. Both of the songs for those were amazing and fit the visuals and the personalities of the characters. The music for this vid was terrible and forgetful. The music didn't say \"varus, the vengeful archer who would sacrifice himself to pure evil to avenge his people\" so much as it said \"so we put music to a stunning visual sequence, and we made varus gay cause why not\". The music could have used a more somber direction, maybe some hints of smallness as the sole defender against an onslaught of hostile warriors. A swell for victory and a quick fall as Varus realizes that his village was probably destroyed. The pace could quicken as he rushes to see what has become of his family. The music could fade, and timpani could start pulsing like a heartbeat. Cut to varus approaching the pit, tempo increasing. Staring into the seething froth of evil he plunges into the pit of corruption. music stops. screen is black. after a beat, see varus transformed, rising out of the bit with big heavy horns and drums playing menacingly as varus shoots an arrow through the noxian flag.","replies":[]}]}
