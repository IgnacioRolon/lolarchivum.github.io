I can't get over how your justification for rigging sports games is that the losing team is compensated for their loss, as if that makes the cheating irrelevant. XD\n\nLet's frame it this way. How cheating occurs is not what makes something a sport or not. If technology existed that allowed you to manipulate physics and break physical sports games the same way hacking breaks online games, would sports lose their \"sports\" status? I've watched a cartoon show for little kids where an antagonist has controlled the movement of the ball in a soccer game from the sidelines using a controller to score goals... I guess you would consider soccer invalid as a sport in this cartoon universe lmao\n\nThe definition of a sport is \"an activity involving physical exertion and skill in which an individual or team competes against another or others for entertainment\". If you're going to claim that League of Legends isn't a sport, you must strictly define a sport as being a _physical_ game, claim that skill is not involved in the game, or claim that it is not a competetive game. Cheating is in noways involved in how a sport is defined.\n\nLeague is considered an eSport because it is a virtual skill-based competitive game. Hacking doesn't change any part of this definition that would otherwise disqualify it from being a sport.
