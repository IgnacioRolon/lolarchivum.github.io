Now you can only see that same bar if you CC&#039;d the enemy. This makes layering CC complete guess work and it&#039;s a little frustrating.","replies":[{"poster":"REPORTYASUOXD","date":"2017-12-13T18:57:17.530+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":1,"body":"Don't worry.

I'm all for chain CC being nerfed, and all for casuals being punished for bad play. But between all the subtle nudges to tenacity, the chaos of teamfights, the sheer amount of particle effects that can go on, and then to have to count out CC manually in battle on top of all that? I feel like we're now adding artificial difficulty to the game. I know not every player will be equal, but intentional discrepancies (or discrepancies that arise as a result of intentional action) are just going to make things worse.\n\nChain CC can get nerfed in a lot of ways, this is not one of them. This doesn't nerf it as much as it just makes it harder for certain people and not for others. I generally don't have issues counting out on CC (I've been playing video games a _long_ time though), but I'm not about to support that being how we do it. The bars were fantastic, and non-lingual communication between teammates is damn near essential.\n\nAbove all else in League we need to realize that there's not always time or space to talk about it. Simple indicators, like being able to ping our health and mana like they added so long ago, are great steps forward for this. Removing indicators such as for CC is a step backwards.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CrabDust","date":"2018-01-09T22:10:57.677+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh hey, just saw this thread.
