Is it safe for me to play pvp or should i should I play bots for now?","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Randomly in the middle of an ARAM game my screen froze, speakers freaked out, and i got a blue screen. After the inital restart it said windows didnt load properly, and made me restart again. The blue screen read \"system service exception\" with the normal windows frown and stuff. Im a little scared to try to play another game now because of that. This is the 2nd time i've had this happen, but the other time was a month or 2 ago when I wasn't on league. I played all day yesterday and didnt turn my computer off over night, could that be the reason? Im just confused about what to do and if I should even be playing right now.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-23T18:04:52.838+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah that sounds pretty serious if you get a fatal error like that.  Probably not a good idea to hop into matchamde games for now, and stick to custom games to troubleshoot.  Check your air vents to make sure it's not overheating, and hit us up in a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) so our tech team can look into this with you.","replies":[]}]}
