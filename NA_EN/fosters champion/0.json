Then I learn not only who I like to play the most, but also the way that I like to play the most.  I'm playing all the champs in each role/lane in alphabetical order right now (in blind pick) and my mmr has dropped like a rock, lol.  But that's OK because I'm finding out that I like people I didn't think I'd like (ahri) and disliking people I thought I'd like (thresh).  You'll find that some champs will just \"make sense\" to you, and those are the champs you should start spamming.\n\nThere's a secondary benefit to playing through everyone in the game too, and that is that you understand what they do, so you know how to not only counter them better, but also work with them better when your teammates play them.  Truly understanding what each champion is capable of is probably enough to pull you into silver.\n\nAs you're going through this, work on fundamentals - cs and map awareness.  Once you know who you like to play, take the time to [learn to cs with them](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/204xyb/learn_to_cs_like_a_challenger_with_elyndar_a/)  CSing with poppy is very different than csing with Varus for example.\n\nMap awareness though, that is the same no matter who you are.  So you can work on that the entire time you're playing.  When you're about to engage, look at the map.  When you disengage, look at the map.  When your spells are on cooldown, look at the map.  When you're walking back to lane, look at the map.  Every time you don't actually need to be looking directly in front of you, look at the map.\n\nIf you do the above, you're probably going to hit gold.","replies":[{"poster":"PK Arcfire","date":"2015-06-13T15:41:50.904+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"But I main Ezreal. \n\"Who needs a map?\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"Darth Ponzius","date":"2015-06-16T11:07:22.105+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"But that doesn't answer at all at the problem of afks (and the ridicoulous fact that 4 player pay for that), troll and people that from the end of the last season get placed in silver after the 10 qualification games, when they clearly do not have the game knowledge to stay there (and i'm not talking about bad game, but about lack of mechanincs, no idea of how to build at least in a decent way etc).\nIn a promo system is sincerelly ridicolous to let someone lose a promo or lp for an afk. They maybe can be punished with a 6 minutes ban from ranked (or more if this isn't the first time) but the other 4? They can lose lp, promo get demoted etc and that generate just frustration.\nThe ranked soloq system is totally wrong at low elo, you use a system like mmr or elo, that should reward consistency, together with a promo system beetween divisions that reward winning streaks. People that get placed in silver when they have clearly to be bronze ruin a ton of games. Maybe in the long term they will fall down, but how many game they have to decide in favor of the enemy with the lack of knowledge of the game?\nThe mmr derive from the chess ranking system. A 1 vs 1 game. Lol is a 5 vs 5 game. A game where one man on one team doing badly, going afk, trolling can decide the game for the other 4. With all this randomness the system need too much game to give a good result.\nThis system reward only victories (something that can have sense in a 1 vs 1 game but not in a 5 vs 5) not counting at all your performance and rewarding or punishing  in the same way the one that did poorly and the one that did a good game.\nIn promo you get usually matched vs people of superior divisions, so if you want to get promoted in a higher division you have to demonstrate to be better then the players of that division with a series of 3 or 5 games.","replies":[]},{"poster":"disregardable","date":"2015-06-13T12:37:07.726+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"wow big promises there lol.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Dracid","date":"2015-06-13T15:30:03.339+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"stop taking teleport as an ADC for one","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dracid","date":"2015-06-13T15:32:24.498+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"you have 61 kills to 79 deaths over your last 10 matches. you can blame afks and trolls all you want but your own skill has loads of room for improvement.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dedrius","date":"2015-06-13T03:31:42.943+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your CS is very low in all of the games I looked at so work on that.

I had troll after troll, feeder after feeder and I swore I would never get out of Bronze and that it was all my teams fault. It got so bad I was raging and being toxic (more on that later). \n\nDuring the time leading up to that day I had been playing a lot of Fizz, and losing...a lot. My own scores were frequently good from a KDA stand point, but my win rate was in the 20% range with Fizz. \n\nI realized that the problem was that while I could kill at will and o \"tons of damage\" Fizz wasn't very good at killing towers **quickly** and as a result my teams weren't getting enough towers/objectives after team fights, and telling them to follow up after team fights wasn't working. \n\nLong story short I decided to play a champion I could **both** kill everyone with, and then push lanes, kill towers and take objectives. I chose Fiora for this. \n\nAs I stated on June 5th I was Bronze 4 with 0 LP, That's when I decided to play Fiora in the top lane AND the jungle, as well as mid when I could get a matchup against a mage with no escapes like Brand etc.  Anyway, 5 days later on June 10th I was in promos to Silver with 1 win in the series before I got in trouble for the toxic raging I had done back on the days leading up to the 5th. So I had to win the required number of normals, which I eventually did. I got back to the series and got out of Bronze Yesterday.  During that time playing as much Fiora as possible I was able to have a 76% win rate with her, and the confidence of those wins helped me when I had to play a champion/role other than her in the three roles mentioned previously. \n\nI'm not a pro, I'm not even particularly good at League of Legends, but I was able to get out of Bronze by \"specializing\" in one champion, spread over three roles, and overall playing a much smaller pool of champions. I probably wont make it above Silver, but my goal was to be out f Bronze, so I'm ok with that. \n\nHere's my LoLking so you can see the drastic drop, then the steep climb out of Bronze when I stopped trying to \"be good at all roles\" \n\nhttp://www.lolking.net/summoner/na/20865333\n\n\nAnyway, I hope this was helpful in some way, good luck and I hope you make it out of Bronze.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Retillin","date":"2015-06-13T20:11:18.284+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Number one rule to climbing. Don't blame your team. Mathematically for every troll/afk/noob you get and causes you a loss, you get a win for having a troll/afk/noob on the other team. You just might not understand that was the reason you won. So stop blaming and focus on yourself.

I'll give the advice I've been given: narrow your champion pool down to three or four per role. Utilize flex picks to reduce time spent mastering multiple champions. Skillful play with a handful of champions will get you far in Bronze.  I climbed b4 to b3 in S3 by spamming Quinn against melee tops, and went from b3 to b1 last season with Shyvana. I probably would have made Silver then if I hadn't played so many silly one-offs and whim picks. Best of luck, don't let it get to you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cosnirak","date":"2015-06-13T09:09:13.390+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"One of the most important things you can do is find a champion that you like and that you're good with and (this is the big one) that can carry a game almost single handedly in the mid-late game. You won't get to Silver playing Taric or Nami unless you're a Diamond player or above. You'll probably end up needing at least 2 such champions due to the way pick/ban works but it's ok to focus on one of them a lot more if they aren't banned a lot. They also need to not have a really awful early game. You don't need to get 3 kills before 15 minutes but you do need to not feed just because you have a bad matchup. So be safe or powerful early, carry later.\n\nNaturally most of the champions who can do that are also banned a lot (Fizz/Kat/Ekko/Zed/ect.). There are some that are only banned some of the time or not at all though. Personally I highly recommend Morgana and Annie, both as mid whenever you can but they'll be good support options too when you have to support and not too many will complain if you take Morgana top (she's good at it but it's often a lot harder to carry that way). If you really prefer top lane I recommend Rumble, Hecarim, or maybe Vlad if you can consistently get past his very early levels in good shape (including decent cs). For jungle I recommend Gragas (though he's banned a lot), Hecarim, Vi, Shaco, and Xin (and Lee Sin if you can play him really well).\n\nBot lane really sucks in Bronze because your lane partner might just be so bad you that you lose lane horribly despite playing really well. Despite that you should know how to play at least 2 ADCs and supports enough to not feed on your own much as you will end up having to play them from time to time.\n\nAny time you have to play a role or champion you can't carry from make sure you aren't feeding. Don't take big risks you don't need to and farm up. Take time to notice objectives and vision control. Make sure you're itemizing well. Focus on what you can do to shut down any enemies carrying and helping anyone on your team that's carrying.\n\nSomething else really important is your mentality. Ignore your LP and rank. Whether you're Bronze 5 or Bronze 1 all that matters is the game you're in right now. Expect to lose nearly half of them no matter how well you do so be ready to lose, and due to other people's mistakes. Focus on what YOU did wrong and can do better. You're not going to make your team mates play better any time soon. But if you get even better you'll be able to win more games despite your team.\n\nIn regards to your cs here's some math to show how important cs is. A normal kill is worth 300 gold. ~15 cs is worth 300 gold. Most of the time in the first 5 minions waves players don't get a kill. If you miss a little under half of the cs in your first 5 minion waves you're missing out on a kill's worth of gold that fast.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SH Azykan","date":"2015-06-13T03:24:57.853+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"grind out games, as long as you consistently perform at a skill level above that of the other players in your matches you will have a winrate of over 50% (the afk's/trolls balance out over enough games as does chances of a lane getting stomped)  \n\nAlso play champions that allow you to play to your personal strengths.  I took to Morgana for this exact reason.  I can take her Top, Mid, or support, as she is rarely able to be counter picked in any situation.  She is easy to gank for (initiate the gank with your ult, follow up with binding at the end of the duration and drop W) and is strong without even receiving ganks in lane. Safe with her E, hard to shove under tower thanks to W, and nobody is going to dive you unless they are retarded or you already super messed up. As a mid laner her bot lane roams post 6 are terrifying as she has good damage, good CC and can prevent a turnaround with E. As a result her mid game is great. And late game Morgana's utility and damage offer so much to team fights.  I have a great winrate with her in ranked for this reason and as I before felt like I was going to tank my mmr, I now am in my series to get into silver after just 2 days (gotta wait for internet to be stable again to do the series though).\n\nBeing flexible, while making sure I have an impact in every phase of the game and a great team fight presence is exactly what I needed.\n\nFind a champion that covers exactly what you feel is lacking in most of the games you play. And make sure you are able to manipulate the pace of the game based on the champion you are comfortable on.\n\nDo you feel Renekton is your best champ? Try to get ahead on your lane opponents early without playing too risky. And then transfer your lead into other lanes to end the game as quickly as possible.\n\nIs Vayne better for you? Maybe try to focus on getting objective control and scale.\n\n\n\nAnother thing you could do is find a duo partner that you can count on to be reliable. They don't necessarily have to be better than you, but make sure that you can count on them to make better decisions than most players. Use the fact you are a duo to get a communication edge on the enemy team. You don't even have to be in remotely the same lane. My Duo partner swears I am better than him, but I feel that in most games he has a far larger impact in us winning, whereas I just help keep us from losing. I am a mid main, he is a jungle main. Some games though I go top and he is support. We can get even the crappiest of adc's fed with coordinated tele's and make the game easy to win.  So communication in that front can also help increase your winrate drastically (also lowers the odds of you having a troll in your game because you only have 3 unknowns on your team vs 4)\n\n\nAnyways good luck on climbing, and hope this helps a little bit ^_^","replies":[]}]}
