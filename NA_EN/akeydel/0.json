Playing safe means giving up lane control and cs, letting the enemy laner push to your tower where you can either stay and get dived or back off and lose your tower when the enemy jungler comes. And if your jungler can't secure dragon 4v3 then you've just lost a tower for free. Playing \"safe\" in toplane isn't like playing safe in midlane. Especially if you're behind and can't get deep wards into the enemy jungle. You can get ganked from the lane brushes or dived from behind your tower if you let the lane just sit at your tower without jungle pressure. Unless your jungler knows that and is willing to give up dragon control to keep you safe then playing \"safe\" is just about the stupidest thing you can do in toplane.\n\nSure, if your botlane and midlane are powerspiking or just ahead in gold then you can secure dragon with a 1-man advantage, but usually the best you'll get is to clear their wards and set up your own, and that's not as good as a tower.","replies":[{"poster":"terkmc","date":"2015-05-06T00:00:13.921+0000","up_votes":34,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeah, go ahead, dont play safe against the 5/0/0 {{champion:122}} , see how that works out for ya","replies":[{"poster":"Frikgeek","date":"2015-05-06T09:17:35.659+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":17,"body":"If he's 5-0-0 then him and the jungler can safely dive you anyway.
