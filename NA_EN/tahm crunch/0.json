Whenever I place mushrooms in bushes, sometimes they randomly explode before their time expires. There are no invisible champions on the enemy team, no minions walked past it, it was just sitting there and exploded. When they do a little popup saying something like invincible pops up, i&#039;m thinking it may have to do with ward rubble/residue from the new preseason. \r\nIt may have to do with something like the residue counting as the same type of entity as champions and minions so when it appears it blows up the mushroom. This has only happened since that update. This is extremely aggravating since all they have to do is place a ward in a bush and then when it dies my mushroom also dies. If you could fix this asap.","replies":[{"poster":"Overheadpillow","date":"2015-11-21T20:02:54.250+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"They are aware that this bug is out there and they are working on it\n\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report/GaxzBge0-teemo-rubble-pops-shrooms","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-11-23T22:32:38.619+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for linking this! :D","replies":[{"poster":"dod21","date":"2015-11-24T04:00:29.311+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot KateyKhaos,realm=NA,application-id=LqLKtMpN,discussion-id=HIyHTEGV,comment-id=00030000,timestamp=2015-11-23T22:32:38.619+0000)\n>\n> Thanks for linking this! :D\n\n@Riot KateyKhaos: Do you have any idea on the timeframe within which to expect a fix for these Teemo shroom bugs?
