So in the past couple weeks, I have been experiencing MAJOR issues with connecting to my games. A couple games, I would disconnect and have had to reconnect 14 times in a row (This is not an exaggeration) for it to actually work. \r\n2. I have had multiple occasions where I would get into the loading screen after everyone has connected, and I would sit there at 50%. \r\n3. Shortly after, the second bug I experienced would be that I would connect after so many frustrating disconnects, I would get in game. And NOTHING would load other then the map itself. No one would spawn, no character models, just the map.\r\n4. To finish this off I have also had multiple occasions where it would tell me I had no internet and I have had to relaunch the League Client 4 times before I actually connect to the game. \r\n\r\nIf this was my fault and I somehow did something wrong I would love to know.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-05T22:32:19.419+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This sounds really awful, I'm sorry.  :(  Your connection, at least to League, is super degraded and I recommend troubleshooting in custom games for now.
