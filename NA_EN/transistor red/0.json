Is there anything I can do?\n\n\n\n\nMy op.gg so people understand I'm not some bronze or silver making excuses. I worked for my mmr and am proud of where I am. I know I'm not a pro or anywhere decent enough with other Diamonds, but I do not want to lose this account over something I cannot even test.\n\nhttps://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=Transistor+Red\n\n I've taken time to test my fps and ms usually at 30 stable. Until the recent patch that is. This is the only known case I've had of random disconnection. In where sometimes my ping pops to 40-70 and my fps turns to 0. This is never true in normals where I keep a stable 30 ping. \n\nIs there any way I can accurately test and give feedback because I'm not risking another report for a potential disconnect game where all I do is attempt to reconnect.\n\nI can show normal game ms but am afraid of dcing constantly with ranked game. Again this all started after the new patch released as while the beta had certain issues for me even on Low-Spec, I never really had an issue until 7.4 specifically. \n\nI even wait a day a time before doing a normal into a ranked, scanned my computer, tested network ping, and nothing really works.
