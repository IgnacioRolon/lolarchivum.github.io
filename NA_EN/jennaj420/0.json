For some reason my Discord isn't catching that I'm playing League and I have to manually add it to display by my name. When I do my League clients crashes, then as I try to close my client to relog it just keeps crashing over and over. I have to Ctl, Alt, Del to get rid of the client completely. Anyone else having these issues? I have tried running both programs through the troubleshooter using previous Window's settings but still not working together. Any idea's?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-18T00:43:53.312+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmmm that does sound pretty strange. I'm not super informed of how Discord integration works so I don't know how helpful I'll be with that. Are you able to get League running normally by itself?","replies":[{"poster":"R1ckS4nchez","date":"2017-09-22T23:42:09.472+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, league client runs perfectly fine by itself.\nI performed a full reset of the client, that is uninstall and reinstall. The issue still exists.\nClient refused to run while Discord is also running. It only started today, just now in fact. If there's any information anyone has feel free to drop it on me.","replies":[{"poster":"TCGK subzero","date":"2017-09-23T01:09:08.935+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What i did to fix this problem was i went into discord and went to the \"user settings\". I then went to overlay and turned off \"enable in-game overlay.\" Then i started back up my league client and it started working again. I believe the problem has to do with the discord overlay and you do not want it turned on or else you will get the client to continuously crash. When i turned it off though, now my discord and league work together just fine.","replies":[{"poster":"grizzly579","date":"2017-09-23T15:38:51.455+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=TCGK subzero,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=gY9xIRhO,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2017-09-23T01:09:08.935+0000)\n>\n> What i did to fix this problem was i went into discord and went to the &quot;user settings&quot;.

I have not changed any settings in discord in a long time so i don't know if its overlay issues or something.
