I will keep trying to see if it is a temporary issue or will have to repair client or even uninstall and download the game again but was wondering if anybody else was having any issues similar to this one or completely different with the new patch that came out.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-22T22:12:28.896+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You may have had a bad update that corrupted some game files, or even an out dated driver causing the game to fail rendering.
