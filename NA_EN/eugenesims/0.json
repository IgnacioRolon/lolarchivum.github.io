In the middle of a ranked game, too. Just my like. Is the server shitting itself or am I the only one who had the misfortune of being screwed over by these issues?\r\n\r\nIt is not a problem on my end.\r\nI've checked connection, nothing is updating, ping is usual, last games were just fine.\r\n\r\nUgh, how unlucky...","replies":[{"poster":"Dark Morgana","date":"2016-02-19T01:56:59.927+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey EugeneSims, \n\nWasn't seeing any Server issues today and if you're unsure about it, you can always look here first: http://status.leagueoflegends.com/#na\n\nAs far as your lagging issues, you may want to try troubleshooting and seeing if that corrects the issue.
