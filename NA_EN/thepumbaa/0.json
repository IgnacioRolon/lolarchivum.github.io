I started playing LoL this month and I can't play a single game without a fear of crash.\r\n\r\nI join the Q, pick a champion and when the game starts loading it just pops black and only thing I see is the mouse and I can hear sounds but other is just black. I've uptaded my nvidia drivers like 3x in a week and it starts to piss me off. I have already 20 minutes low priority q on my main and 10 min. low priority on my other acc because of this.\r\n\r\nYesterday for example I was playing flex with 2 of my friends for 2 games just fine and when 1 of my friends went sleep we hit the solo/duo Q ranked and boom... black screen again so they remaked it and I got another leaver buster for this.\r\n\r\nI often get a bug splat because of this.\r\n\r\nIs it some kind of Virus ? I am already pissed off, every time getting leaverbuster because I can't even join the f*cking game because of some cheap programmers in Riot.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-30T20:29:14.606+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your hardware or drivers could be acting up, so it was good that you updated them.
