I am done waitining 20 minutes for just one game.\n\nReason why I got low priority Q is because I've got 2 games black screen due to a problem with graphics card drivers.\nI am asking any Riot employee to remove my low priority Queue immediately!\n\nI've joined 2 games and my graphics card drivers were bugged so my screen was pitch black. The guys in the game made a remake and the game didn't count but I've got low priority Queue for 20 minutes.\n\nLike Riot is so stupid with this and LoL have the worst punishment system I've seen in games.\nYou have bugsplat, black screen, connection at the moment, etc. so you must be punished for things you can't fix yourself.\n\nWhy people that doesn't even join must be punished. When I am looking for a game and someone doesn't even join, I am mad but it's ok, it happens in a while... but why does that person must be punished ?\n\n\"Oh you were BORN with 2 hands you must be punished and we must cut those arms off\" ?\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/4vEzs0j.jpg","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-07T20:28:39.306+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We aren't able to remove this leaverbuster, I know it wasn't intentional but all leaves still causes other players a poor experience.
