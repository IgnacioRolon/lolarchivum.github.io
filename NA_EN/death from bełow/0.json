I'm coming to league from dota, but I have a problem. Whenever I try to download the patch I need to play, my download speed is absurdly slow, around 200 kbps. Speedtest.net says my speed is around 50 mbps, so I don't know what's wrong. I'm playing on a 2012 Macbook Pro, som I'm using OSX if that matters.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-25T21:01:50.450+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Welcome, friend!  Your internet sounds pretty solid, but you could be having issues specifically reaching our patching servers.  There could be other factors too like how fast your hard driver is able to write the updates.  As long as you're not running into any errors, it's best to let the patcher do its thing.  \n\nOtherwise, my suggestion would be to run through our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to troubleshoot.  Make sure to select the mac options for steps specific to your OS.   Let me know if you have any questions!","replies":[{"poster":"Death From Bełow","date":"2017-03-26T03:08:26.939+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I actually managed to get it working myself by reinstalling, but thanks anyways :)","replies":[]}]}]}
