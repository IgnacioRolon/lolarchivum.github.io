This season it was a soft reset so you played with people around your level, not sure where you ended last season but bronze and silver have so many players, if you were low s3 or s4 playing placements around your level and not going through without losses you probably stay around there and just move up a bit. I mean it takes 5-7 wins to go from 0 LP to promos depending on LP gain and such.","replies":[{"poster":"Stars Shaper","date":"2015-04-22T15:41:34.148+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"The thing is that winning more should mean you are better.

You have everyone playing to be placed again, so the really good players and really bad players are all in the middle. The players who were diamond placed with bronze and silver opponents Should win almost all their games. The low bronze players placed with silvers and golds should lose almost all their games. An average silver player should be around 5-5. So even a not great run can get you decent placement of the wins were at the front since the first few games count for more if they have the right algorithms.\n\nHowever this season it was a soft reset so people got bumped around a bit but diamond and plat players aren't down stomping bronze and silvers and b5 aren't playing up in mid or high silver. People play closer to their own level so you should have more wins to stay there or go up any. If you were a little below where you got placed this season it makes sense because you did well but not amazing, while two seasons ago you did not great but were reset to mid elo anyway and were playing against better players that season so the result was better even with less wins.","replies":[{"poster":"Stars Shaper","date":"2015-04-23T06:57:56.653+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yep I did understand what soft and hard reset means. I'm saying that the current system doesn't solve anything and it also seems like any kind of improvement isn't registered at all. Honestly I would prefer to face better players and test my abilities instead of noticing improvements from my side (I've always been around Silverish elo) not rewarded but even punished because for this system \"I didn't improve enough\" while Ia ctually doubled my results.","replies":[{"poster":"T RexHasLongLegs","date":"2015-04-23T18:26:16.477+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay, I can see that. I can definitely agree that is frustrating. I notice some difference in mine but it is generally only in wide gaps. So if your play doesn't change DRASTICALLY I could see it being really frustrating. I was placed bronze 3 or 4 the first season I played ranked and improved enough to make gold 5 s3 (but was silver mmr at the end bc I struggled hard enough to climb that I spent more time trying to get better on other stuff than just play the 2 or 3 champs I could play on to gold level of play), and when I placed for s4 I definitely saw the difference between my bronze play s3 and my silver play s4. Stayed in silver s4 because the jungle changed and I never really adapted to find something I wanted to main and took so much time off after season that I was bronze in placements this season and definitely saw the difference in my play.\n\nAs a side note one issue that can be frustrating and is more an elo system issue than a riot issue is elo inflation. Over time the number 1200 elo doesn't change (or in this case the level represented by silver, gold, plat, whatever) but the skill level represented by it does. People get better at a game the longer it is played and the more theory is understood. S3 bronze the warding was way worse, people never talked about objective, and it was generally weaker play. S5 bronze felt like S4 low silver to me and low silver feels kinda like mid silver from last season. People improve their play and so to stay better than them the higher elo players have to get better or they lose elo to players who are improving and thus fall down, so over time the average skill of a particular elo goes up and to increase elo during that time you have to get better at a faster rate than the skill creep in elo. Which is frustrating because you can see the skill difference and that there is no change in ranking.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"defocold","date":"2015-04-22T22:12:58.958+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because league does not reward individual play, it's all about your team, and that's not fair at all.
