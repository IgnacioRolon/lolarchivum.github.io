Those are the only two logical ways I could see this being approached, but Riot apparently hates Cassi, so they'd probably sooner gut her again because she's actually seeing play (if I'm not mistaken).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Leu07","date":"2016-01-03T22:37:49.751+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They could just put her Q and W cds as they were before the rework and remove the 25% from the passive, she could have something a bit more useful, maybe \"shed skin\" in which Cassiopeia gains some tenacity.
