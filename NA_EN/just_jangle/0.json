It&#039;s a shift from previous entries which have sent the player to places like the Himalayas, Pacific Islands and the Stone Age.\n\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/davidthier/2017/05/25/far-cry-5-worldwide-reveal-coming-tomorrow/#208fbbbf57ee\n\nIGN is gonna be there for the reveal.\nhttp://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/25/ign-live-presents-far-cry-5-reveal\n\nI really enjoy this series, hopefully this one delivers too.","replies":[]}
