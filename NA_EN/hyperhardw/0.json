Recently, I was in a game with a draven (had a similar name to tyler1 so likely a fanboy of the “toxic” persona” who got bad at the team, so proceeded to do everything in his power to make us lose. Stealing farm from jungle, and I don’t mean just getting behind and farming to get back in the game. I mean walking around my entire jungle, taking camps and leaving 1 wolf, 1 raptor, etc. stealing farm from top and mid lane. Ulting into our fountain. Sitting in botlane, waiting for enemy to come and kill him. He admitted to trolling in ally chat, and I explain all of this in my report. I requested a human, and got the same “report successfully solved, we can’t tell you what happens blah blah blah”. I check his account today and he’s still playing this game.","replies":[{"poster":"Kuthillick","date":"2020-01-03T22:51:15.218+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"That doesn't mean he wasn't punished or this isn't a punishment on the way. Most gameplay infractions take awhile to review and punish, it is not an instant system. You reported them which is the most you can do.

If they solved it, he would punished, imo. If by solved they mean it is in a queue for review, then thats a different story, and I dont think they should use the term solved if it hasnt been reviewed yet. All they may need is 5 minutes to review that, but theres probably thousands of other (usually bogus) reports they need to go through first. However, the solved part is unsettling. They solved it? What does that mean?!
