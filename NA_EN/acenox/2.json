For every dimension, he can summon a copy of himself.\nIo is a being that connects all living things. It is the essence of magnetism and attraction, meaning it controls matter to a level.\nEnigma can eat matter and summon black holes as well as devolve beings to the simplest state possible. Last time I checked, black holes beat stars.\nDoom is the devil itself. Nuff said.\nAncient Apparition can freeze anything to absolute zero, meaning all matter does not move in any way, shape, or form. Any heat that touches it is instantly brought to absolute zero as well. Nothing can get near it without freezing. It's so cold that light particles would freeze around it.\n\nDota characters are absolutely bonkers lore-wise.

He is just a cross roads demon that preys on the innocent.\nDoom is vague, so I'm not entirely sure how powerful he is exactly. Naga could definitely be stronger.\nThe difference between Ancient Apparition is he does it without even trying. Things just freeze around him and he can do it on an extremely long range scale if he tries. Nunu has to both focus and channel to bring things around him to absolute zero, and only temporarily.\n\nThe main one here is Weaver. Weaver isn't limited to creating one dimension nor is he limited by anything. Weaver is limitless and could destroy dimensions other weavers were not protecting them. Plus, Weaver can reverse time and space. Imagine Aurelion Sol, plus Bard, plus Ekko and increase that power a bit, and you get Weaver. Plus, Weaver is not shackled. He is not enslaved at all. He is completely free to do anything he wants as long as he doesn't meddle in the dimensions of another weaver. Aurelion Sol does not have such freedom. He was enslaved by Targon through a trick. If this happened to Weaver, he would simply reverse time and space to make it to where this never happened. If he came close to losing against Aurelion Sol, boop. Not anymore. That's why Weaver is so stupid in his lore. He creates dimenions, reverses time and space, and is completely free to do whatever he wants as long as it doesn't mess with another weaver. That is insane lore power. The only being in League that comes close to this is Bard, who can traverse dimensions and manipulate matter. However, to my knowledge, he cannot go through time and he cannot create dimensions, so Weaver outclasses him.\n\nAlso Enigma controls anti-matter and I am almost sure that he never sleeps or dreams at all. Nocturne can die. Enigma can too, but a simple shade of a nightmare like Nocturne is a little bit small compared to Enigma. Going beyond all that as well, Enigma is a super clever bastard. He has created false lore about himself so that he can steal whatever he finds from those who seek him if he fidns them to be remotely powerful. Nocturne could track Enigma, find him, but then it wouldn't go down well for Nocturne since Enigma cannot be bound nor can he be attacked physically or mentally. The only way to kill him is to completely obliterate him and destroy all anti-matter in the universe. That is something that even Weaver would have a hard time doing since anti-matter is not limited to one dimension, but all dimensions.\n\nI'm sorry but, the same goes for League. You read into the League lore and think, \"Wow, this is unstoppable,\" and then read Dota lore and things are just stupid. It's lore is so full of beings almost beyond or equal to the power of a god that, until we get a lot more Aurelion Sols in League, there isn't much chance of a win for the League army if we go by lore power.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sahn Uzal","date":"2016-05-29T16:24:09.219+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Idk how strong Dota characters are lore-wise...\n\nMentioned that for a good reason :P","replies":[{"poster":"Meep Man","date":"2016-05-29T18:14:52.078+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know, I was telling how powerful they were so you would know","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
