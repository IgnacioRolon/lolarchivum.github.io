We're left with Hec, Irelia, Lee, Aatrox, and Jax. Jax's, Irelia's, and Aatrox are self-buffs, with a large portion of Jax's power in his Ult Passive regardless, so let's cut them out. So we're left with Lee and Hecarim. \n\nNow let's look at the difference once again between the two. Lee's Ult does not *Normally* give him access to the backline, while Hecarim's gives him innate access due to intargetibility. If a Lee is smart, and good, perhaps he may get to a tank, knock 'em back to the backline, and Q 'em mid process to get back there easily, but that is very situational. \n\nLet's be honest with ourselves, Lee ult isn't going to hit all 4 people, and he'd be very hard-pressed to hit one against a properly organized team. Lee falls off due to the fact that Team's don't allow Lee easy access to the back-line, outside of outplay. Other Divers don't have that problem due to their own kits, and unless the Lee is ahead, he isn't going to be able to do much against a good front line.\n\nWith all that said, Lee has a shorter CD on his Ult, because unlike other Divers, Lee lacks a way late game to break that front-line. Diver's primary targets are Squishies, though they ain't bad against Tanks, and against a Smart organized comp, Lee has no way to get to his targets, unless Via Outplay. \n\nThat's why he has Ward-hops, that's why he has a Low CD Ult, they are tools for him to use to be successful by *how* he uses them, and not tools to be successful by *just* using them. Lee's difficulty is not in learning and getting used to him, but in learning how to use all his tools to be successful against a good team. \n\nNow, the argument could be made for it to be longer early game, and I might be behind that with good reasoning, but late game, it's his only way to contribute against a competent team.","replies":[{"poster":"Weasel Kensei","date":"2017-04-30T19:28:20.026+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"I didnt really do anything to manipulate stuff, I picked champs with the same tags, fighter or slayer or both.

Lee's requires him to get within melee range, granted, but so does Darius' so it isn't like Lee needs to make any risks with his ult, especially with his W to just jump away to wards. Which is even more BS because enemies cant see green wards, at least Braum or Kat have to jump to a visible unit so you can at least get a bit of an idea of their possibilities.

But saying lee has no mechanics is simply untrue.  Lee's mobility enables some of the flashiest and most difficult maneuvers in the game (IMHO).  Lee is effective without the use of his mechanics, which is why he is super strong atm.  Even the shittiest lees can play the champ somewhat effectively, which is why he seems so strong at the moment.  However he has an almost infinite skill ceiling with different plays he can make, that many players cannot do.  \n\nVi is more reliable and with the right build, even better at getting into the backline and oneshotting carries.  I would argue that Vi is more useful lategame as her R is 120% more reliable.

He *should* be mechanical, which  he is, but he has too much safety that it doesn't matter if you can actually use them at this point. Yeah, you can Insec a carry into your team if you're good, but why should you when you can walk up to the tank, R him back through his team, and then Q+Q to him, and slap the E to take him down to sub 1/4 hp, and then w out? That's the issue with Lee right now.\n\nVi does tend to be more reliable, I give you that, but right now, she is reliably sub-par for anyone not familiar with her. I have a 56% winrate on her over about 700 ranked games over seasons 5-7, and probably have over 1000 total if you include normals as well, but the average Vi player right now had below 50% with a 6.5% play rate. Compare that to lee with a win rate of 48% with a 30% win rate. Granted, that includes all the bronze players that think they can play him, so if we take only high elo for the both of them, Vi has the same win and play rate, but Lee has a slightly above 50% win rate with a *40% play rate*. Which as almost everyone agrees, is so stupidly high it isn't even funny. Imagine if Vayne or Riven had those kinds of numbers?\n\nAnd while Lee does fall off, he has a 58% win rate in the early (before 25 min) and it take until 35 minutes for him to hit a 50% win rate. That is super late game, with today's game times. Vi takes the same amount of time to *reach* a 50% win rate. So yeah, in the rare game that it goes late, Vi is better, but even then its not by much.\n\nHow do you get the 120% better number for Vi's ult by the way? Her ult does the same base damage as Lee, but only has a 140% ratio, and does 75% of the damage to everyone else she hits. Lee has a 200% ratio, that does not only the full damage to everyone that is hit, but also 18% of the kicked target's bonus HP.","replies":[{"poster":"WIOP6457","date":"2017-05-01T23:56:56.074+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"That's only if his ult hits something else.

You are right on the safety aspect, but the dmg output is nowhere near the levels of Vayne or Riv.  To be completely fair about it, neither of us should have commentary on either champion.  In high elo lee sin makes it through ban phase which means that they don't have too many problems dealing with him.  \n\nI got the number for Vi's ult because it's point-click, and the exceptional reliability.  A vi on your face is a death sentence for almost all carries, the same could be said for Lee.  Personally I don't find him too overbearing when I play against him, but that may be because I haven't ever been against any that are exceptionally good.  From my experience , Lee seems better when people don't ward and try to play super aggro when he's strong.  His mobility is an issue, but I could see it getting played around.  Lee sin wants to land q on carries, and I never see frontliners blocking.  Also, the whole thin about quarter hp is kind of wonky >_<  Was the tank you're talking about incredibly behind or was the Lee full ad?

Lee can throw it out instantly whenever he wants, as poke, as a brush checker, etc. If Vi uses her Q, she goes with it. If Lee's Q lands, he gets true sight, If Vi's lands, she doesn't. Vi's is weaker because while you can lock a target down, it does far less damage, and it only does 75% damage to anyone else hit.

It's Vi's own fault if her ult forces her into a bad situation, so that's not really a downside. I'm not arguing that Lee is less mobile, just that he's harder to play and easier to do poorly with.\n\nAlso, no player that's half decent will group and let Lee angle his ult so that it hits multiple targets. That's like saying Ori's op just because she can nuke an entire team with a full combo if they're dumb enough to walk into it.

Her only mobility is her Q, which has a 2 second charge time for max distance. Lee's ult is a point and click that *cannot be stopped*, and only modified by using QSS/Cleasne AND Flash. Vi's ult target can still move until she gets there, and force her into a bad position. It is not her own fault, you massive asshat, as it could be a perfectly good play, and the target blows flash tog et over a wall, and the target's team is nearby, and uses the 1.25 sec animation to get to her. Lee's ult not only does more damage, but he stays where he is, and the animation for lee is only .25 seconds, while his target's is 1 second. Lee is definitely not much harder to play, and is Vi is way easier to do poorly with. \n\nYou realize that fights start with a frontline, right? Lee jumps in with his W, ults the tank back through the team, and voila, he has hit AT LEAST 2 other targets due to how stacking up for fights work. If you don't stack up properly, in order to avoid the lee ult, then Lee's team wins anyway because they have the better positioning. And I don't know if you're blind or just stupid, but Ori can move the ball around, which is very hard to track, and easily get a 3+ man Shockwave. It is a very common occurrence that any half-decent player would have seen when an Orianna is in the game. If Lee ults the tank, its one of the best plays he can make, because the tank has probably taken some poke from Lee's team, and now he's at the back of his own team, at low hp, and the lee kick did all of the original damage, plus 18% if the tank's bonus HP to anyone else hit. So ulting just the carry is a stupid move if you could otherwise ult the tank into them, because you actually lose damage.\n\nMaybe next time do some research before you defend bullshit that the grand majority of the playerbase hates.

I have played Lee, and against difficult enemies, I don't play him much because his playstyle is not to my taste. \n\nYou, however, have never played him in ranked for a single game ever, or even a Normal this season. So don't try that bullshit. You have exactly zero lee and Vi experience, you know nothing about both of those champions as evident from your \"arguments\", and if Vi is so much easier, why does Lee have a much higher play rate and a slightly higher winrate? Lee is quite obviously easy to play, otherwise there wouldn't be so many playing him. \n\nThe grand majority hates lee because he is a broken piece of shit, and If you payed any attention to my rank you would see that I hit G3 last season, am gold in flex, and have gold MMR in solo. And even if i didn't, you're silver too, so you have exactly zero room to talk. So don't try to play the superiority card, like you're so much better and smarter. I bet all your losses are because you get trash teams and your jungler never ganks you, too.","replies":[{"poster":"SwaggyMcGhee420","date":"2017-05-02T18:12:31.965+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow, a massive 375 range! That's still close to melee range. Vi's ult isn't a free kill because of its damage, it's a free kill because it's a point and click long range hard cc that is impossible to prevent for most champs. \n\nLee isn't broken. If he was, his winrate would be far above 50%. Vi's easier to pick up and do well with, and is much better late game.\n\nIt's funny you try to invalidate my argument based on my experience and skill level when I'm actually diamond 5. I also have 160k mastery points with Lee and 80k mastery points with Vi. She's been in my top 3 most played champ in ranked since season 3. Don't be so proud of your gold, it's not impressive.","replies":[{"poster":"NiceTryVi","date":"2017-05-02T18:49:01.785+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Guess what? Lee's RQQ is *far* more deadly that Vi's combo, and very rarely will a target even levels with Vi die from 1 rotation. For Lee, he is guaranteed to kill any non-tank. Lee IS broken, because he has a stupidly high playrate on a champion that is supposed to be extremely mechanical and difficult, yet maintains a 50% winrate. Lol, Diamond V, thats a good one. Like I didn't just look you up on op.gg for the truth. And if you're gonna lie, make it impressive. 80k is a joke, I have close to 750k with Vi. Feel free to look that up, by the way. And I will be proud of my gold, because even if it isn't great, its a fuckload better than you are. Claiming to be diamond doesn't change the fact that you needed your gold friend to carry your bronze ass up there.","replies":[{"poster":"NiceTryVi","date":"2017-05-04T16:41:15.157+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Vi and lee have a similar winrate in lategame. So no, I am not arguing against statistics. And the evidence is that you were mid Bronze 1 last season, and are now mid Silver 2, but with a huge winrate. you expect me to believe you improved that much in only a few months? yeah, no. Again, stop lying and claiming you play in diamond because you are obviously not diamond. Your attempts to win an argument that everyone knows you are on the wrong side of is pathetic, and you should be ashamed that it is so important that you be more correct that you go out of your way to lie about your rank and even get a high ranking friend to take part. I am done here, since your retarded little bronzie brain apparently thinks that not only were you not boosted out of bronze, but that Lee is not broken as fuck, but somehow Vi *is* broken. You are so goddamn stupid, it hurts.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SwaggyMcGhee420","date":"2017-05-04T14:23:17.675+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=NiceTryVi,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=kye7veBr,comment-id=00050000000300000000000100000000000000000000000000000001,timestamp=2017-05-02T20:17:38.419+0000)\n>\n> Vi is not better late. \n\n???
