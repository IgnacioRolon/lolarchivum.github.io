Twitch is meant to be the ADC, he pops out of stealth for a massive barrage into your team, though he still has to be relatively exposed while doing so, it's well within expectation that he will be intently focused, and that it would be difficult for him to survive the coming attacks.\n\nEvelynn requires you to use proper positioning, along with catching your opponent out of position, in order to exploit her playstyle to the fullest. You can force enemies to always be on the defensive, playing not only safer, but far more conservatively in general, even for picks, as they know that the risk is Evelynn is lurking about waiting to strike.\n\nBoth are similar in this form, that is they are properly utilized by using safe but unpredictable positioning, intentionally exploiting enemy cooldowns and lack of information to force them into unsavory situations. Evelynn can use her charm in such a manner as to lure targets into her, especially if they are not sure of which direction she may be coming from. If the enemy tower is down, you can fully flank targets if they do not have properly positioned red wards in place to detect her, and when utilizing her charm onto the target, the most logical, and without proper information, only realistic choice is to head to the closest allies or turret, in a situation like this, they will inevitably head right into the Evelynn player, and will do so unwittingly until it is far too late to change course. She has exceptionally high burst, can shred tanks, and builds in a manner as to compliment both of these.\n\nMore often than not the issue lies not in the champion, rather the player. Someone who attempts to play Evleynn in a manner that she is not designed for, or that does not ally with her strengths, will more often than not be severely inefficient, and that player will become a liability to their team rather than an asset. The same is true for any champion, one who does not truly comprehend the limits and power of a champion will never be able to reach it's full potential.\n\nIt would be like saying that Riven is a bad champion, coming from someone who could not perform even the most simple of animation cancels or combos, who then declares that she needs severe buffs in order to be viable. Of course, Evelynn is a far simpler champion, at least on the surface, than Riven, but I digress, Evelynn is an assassin, you must properly await the point in which to strike, while likewise preparing your target in such a manner as to not be instantly protected. If you initiate a fight, you will most certainly be met with failure, as they will close ranks, and you will be slaughtered. However, if you were to strike in the middle of a fight, from behind, without warning, you could most certainly inflict massive damage if not lethal to an exposed carry, for their defenders would likely not be expecting an unseen and unknown attack from a flank. Utilizing your charm is important in particular circumstances, in others it merely reveals your intent and location. It is sometimes far better to mark a target you have no intent to open up on, to force them to retreat and protect themselves, meanwhile you strike at an entirely different opponent. The 35% MR shred is important, that can definitely enhance your burst quite significantly, however in actuality it is not needed if you are capable of playing the champion correctly, relying on it will of course severely reduce any potential efficiency or synergy you may have otherwise had on the champion.\n\nLikewise her ultimate is not solely a damage tool, it comes in a two part effect, in one that it makes her extremely difficult to defeat in a 1v1, allowing her to escape with miniscule health, or to claim victory in an otherwise unwinnable circumstance. Utilizing it properly you do not always have to kill an enemy to get it's full effectiveness out, this is true for assassins in general. Their usually decried focus is to kill the enemy carries, in actuality however there purpose is merely to eliminate them. Forcing the enemy ADC out of a fight by nearly killing them, and then escaping alive yourself without expending any more resources than necessary, can quite easily turn a fight or a game into your favor. You do not always have to kill a target in order to remove them from the equation, sometimes you merely need to zone them. If you think her sole job is to zone the enemy target, then again, you most surely are not playing her correctly. Her upfront strength is lesser than most other champions, this is due in great part to her massive potential for flanking opponents and moving unhindered. Though, she has more than enough damage to quite easily wipe out her preferred targets.","replies":[{"poster":"AllThoseInFavor","date":"2017-10-20T15:09:11.895+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the problem is that yes, eve has to prep targets, wait for 2.5 seconds, make sure they're completely alone without support then go in and burst, twitch doesn't.
