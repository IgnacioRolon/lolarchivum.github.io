Nobody knows why she is alone, what happened to her team, and how she survived. Because of her immensely amount of power, and hunger for it, her team may question her intentions. \"Did she make a pact with the devil for power? Did she kill her team because of the pact, or just for fun? She may have not betrayed her team, but maybe she abandoned them? Will she do the same with us?\"\n\nFrom the way Riot phrased her SG lore, it is clear that she is a really big question mark and in any kind of genre this makes the plot far more interesting.\n\nAbout Ahri... I think that she is that popular cheerleader that considers herself above everyone, including her team. She may have the skills to be a leader. However, from her interactions, we can understand that she is not always the \"good\" girl. It seems like she is switching sides depending on which Star Guardian she fights.\n\nThis leads to the idea that Ahri is an unstable part of the team. Combined with the fact that she is the leader, she may actually tear apart the team after betraying them (but I think Miss Fortune would take up her role, and that they will eventually fight each other). I believe she is the classical I switch sides, and, unlike Jinx, she actually allies with the evil.","replies":[{"poster":"Supreme Senpai69","date":"2017-09-09T01:47:49.919+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"I don't think Ahri would ever betray her team.
