His Taunt's menacing visual pose feels like it was intended to be matched with more aggressive rhetoric.","replies":[{"poster":"The Iceborn","date":"2019-12-28T16:13:08.669+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Reviving necro- threads which already had their time to shine is against [Universal Rules](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/community-moderation/ITFIpNUE) and as such I will be locking this thread to make sure it lands at the bottom of the howling abyss.

I also want to pat you and the rest of the team on the back for a job well done in regards to Aatrox overall VO. There is a truly seamless transition in going from his universe story to his in game experience. \n\nThe story of a hero who was tainted by the evil he fought, then instead of being aided in healing his damaged ideals, he was betrayed by those he once sought to protect. I'm really rooting for {{champion:266}}.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"mrmeddyman","date":"2018-12-20T22:39:32.569+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well he kinda just taunts everyone automatically when he steps in lane anyways.","replies":[]}]}
