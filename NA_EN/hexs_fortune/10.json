Its new town area, on the other hand, has wide open plazas, tall pale-stone buildings, with a certain amount of formality and order.  (To be clear, this 'new town' was built around 1800, so 'new' is relative.)\n\nZaun is the original - Piltover is the new.  Both have their beauty - whether it's the beauty of history and variety, or the beauty of the new and the ordered.  (Though, the beauty of Zaun now lies under a layer of grime and enrobed in the Gray.)","replies":[{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2018-08-02T17:42:22.296+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Bioluminescence,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=MdajWHIW,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2018-08-02T15:09:13.016+0000)Zaun is the original - Piltover is the new.

If anything I'd have expected to see Piltover be the original, and spread downward as the population grew (pushing the less wealthy individuals lower and lower as time passed).","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2018-08-02T18:23:45.816+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=The Djinn,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=MdajWHIW,comment-id=000000000001,timestamp=2018-08-02T17:42:22.296+0000)\n>\n> This begs an interesting question.\n> \n> Since Zaun is largely subterranean, *why* was a city -- let alone one at such a strategic location -- built in such an inconvenient manner and location as inside a canyon?
