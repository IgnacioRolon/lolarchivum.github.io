Orianna and Gragas are top tier competitive picks but have an under 50% win rate.  No one on these forums seems to grasp that win rates DO NOT directly correlate to a champion's balance, except in EXTREME circumstances like some of the Juggernaughts post patch.\n\nThis thread is the same shit people have been miming like lemmings all over the forums constantly, and frankly, I'm glad Riot doesn't listen to most of you morons.  There are always going to be balance problems; LoL is a growing game and it's difficult to balance an increasingly large roster of champions against each other.  But spamming threads about how Vayne is OP, which Riot is well aware of, doesn't take into consideration the fact that they might be working on it without further upsetting the balance of the game or trying to approach its balance indirectly.  Certain champions being powerful at certain points in the game's life time aren't always because of the flat numbers, sometimes it's because their lane counters are particularly weak at the moment, or certain itemization options that favor them are more powerful, and that opens up an entire web of balance that Riot cannot simply balance directly or carelessly lest they make a mess of things even more.\n\nBe patient, smarten up, and look to your own game.  This thread mentions Galio has no place in the game, and a lot of people say that Zac and Aatrox are woefully underpowered or out of place, but I've climbed my way to Diamond playing largely those 3 champions among a few other odd balls.  Stop being so concerned with what is and what isn't OP or FOTM and just play what you want and try to get good at it, and you'll get some where.\n\nIn the meanwhile, I'm sure Riot is going to work on these things.

All doing the above accomplishes is letting the top tier reign supreme to an even greater degree because now the somewhat good champions you might use to try to even the scales have been nerfed.\n\nFor a game this large with so many champions and items, the only real solution Riot has is to use a \"water-wheel\" sort of balancing process where they just continually adjust champion power based on what becomes \"OP\" after their last round of changes. The only alternative would be to make absolutely no changes to items/champions for a prolonged period of time and then release a massive rebalancing patch to try to get EVERY champion into a balanced state.

Champions that Riot believes are fun to watch are prioritized above and beyond champions that are fun to play. \n\nRiot has a real beef with Mages and Assassins (built as such) recently, as they deal burst damage. They can be extraordinarily fun and risky to play, but teamfights become shorter, yes? Not as much action in LC$.\n\n\"Counterplay\" has become a word used to justify changes, not make them. Counterplay no longer means \"behaviors in the game meant to reduce the impact of present or anticipated enemy action\" as much as it means \"things you can do to negate what your opponent _just did,_ making no assumptions about your champion choice, positioning, or items.\" The power of items has been devalued. Riot's justification for Fiora's ultimate doing % max health burst damage was, \n\n\"[it] allows her to threaten bulkier ones without having an unfair advantage against the more fragile.

Administrative policy is pushing the game away from a contest of strategy, positioning, and resource management, into a contest of fine motor control and reflex.

Galio could easily need a rework to give him a better identity, or maybe just a simple buff, yet Riot buffs Lee Sin.\n\nThen we have Vayne, hardly the healthiest ADC in the roster, and she's allowed to dominate for how long now? 3 months? 2? i don't know but it's been a while and Riot nerfs Shen instead of Vayne.\n\nThey are discussing Syndra buffs, yet everybody who remembers why she was nerfed in the first place knows how much of an horrible idea it is to buff Syndra.","replies":[{"poster":"Cosnirak","date":"2015-09-10T07:18:50.990+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Eve doesn't deserve to be viable, she's toxic so i understand why Riot nerfs her.\"\n\nThis is a great example of people having their own opinion of how things should be and how often that differs from other random players, let alone Riot. So often the forums are a hotbed of echo chamber, group think, upvote farming, win rate touting (as if it matters) utter _garbage_ repeated by idiots who are awful at balance. And that's from a fellow hater of Riven who wants to see her nerfed into oblivion. Riot's not perfect, but they're WAY better at balance than the forums give them credit for and obviously way better than the average forum goer at it.\n\nEDIT: To be clear, I'm not saying you're doing those things. But the forums in general do, and I'm sure you've seen the end result of it.\n\n---\nMy own feelings on the champions you mentioned just for your pleasure so you can contrast it with how you feel about them and see what I mean:\n\nI don't think Eve is toxic or should be made unviable (and neither does Riot from what I've seen). But that's just my opinion on the matter. I've only barely played her, don't play against her that often, and she seems fine in the high tier and pro games I watch. ~~The latest PBE nerf seems a little unnecessary to me but not that big anyways.~~  Oh look I just checked and the latest PBE changes include reverting that nerf. PBE is PBE.\n\nI agreed with Riot on the energy return change for Lee as a fellow Lee scrub (I don't even own him). The ult buff seemed tiny but not really needed. Overall a pretty small impact, especially at high tier play.\n\nGalio is a weird situation to me because I think he's actually quite good. However he has kit issues that make him a little worse as skill and coordination of the enemy go up, making it very unlikely for him to see high tier play. Also he's really hard to play well, especially early on because his mana is rough at first. Combined these two factors leave him in an awkward spot where he's OP at low tier play but only in the hands of people who main him. But if Riot makes his mana less of an issue in the early game he gets really annoying to play against for lower tier players. So how to change him? And does he really need changes? I'm not sure he does. They did in fact buff him twice this season as well, though not greatly. I could see his E costing 60-80 mana instead of the 70-90 it does now though. Currently using it early at all is usually a mistake.\n\nI don't think Vayne is a big problem right now. I know the stats. Blah blah stats are skewed, partially self perpetuating bs anyways. The main thing is Blade of the Ruined King is too good and Vayne is annoying to deal with. I think if they just cut the stealth on her ult + tumbles in half and nerf BotRK a little she'd be fine. It's hard to cc her when you can't see her.\n\nShen was a little too good. I think they're trying to make his laning and split pushing a little less safe as well as take away some of his hidden power in team fights. Seems reasonable. He got some hefty buffing earlier this season and has seen a lot of pro play since.\n\nAs long as they're done right I'm ok with some Syndra buffs. They just gotta be real careful. Her mid game is good and with all the bug fixes a lot more consistent now. I wish her play style was a little less binary but whatever. And that's from someone who currently gets facerolled by Syndra. Man I gotta learn how to play vs her better. If they buff her enough elsewhere they should increase the cd on her ult a little, it's rather low for a point and click nuke.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Egillion","date":"2015-09-09T22:25:12.410+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Some champions SHOULD be kept away from the competitive scene that's for sure.

In casual  and semi-serious (ranked  & high elo ranked) play, those things matter more than ever. \n\nDo you remember the days ( late season 2 and the entire season 3 basically) where Riot tuned down rengar so much that he wouldn't even be playable in normal games lol. This is the typical example of what Riot is capable of. The cat was basically a trash champion with like 40% win rate or something like that. \n\n**So in the end, the problem is that if you want to win games, you HAVE TO be on Riot's side as far as balance goes. **","replies":[]}]}]}
