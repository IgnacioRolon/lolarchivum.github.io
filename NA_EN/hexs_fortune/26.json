Take Skarner for example, he used to be an inescapable duelist in S3, his weaknesses were being unable to get to people, weak early game pressure, and organized team fighting. Now he is the complete opposite, it's easy to escape Skarner, he's got mage movement speed and no perma slow/Q movement speed, not all champions escape super easy but over 50% of them have no issue escaping him 1v1, he's fucking slow. As for dueling, he is by far the weakest fighter in the game if he doesn't have his spires with him, bad duel potential, and his team fight, well now people who built tank are benefiting, hp stacking has given him a bigger shield even though it's CD is much much higher than it used to be (due to loss of energize) and so he is a team fighting tank focused on dragging carries. The entire idea behind the champion has been completely reversed to something much less fun.\n\nSion shared a simular fate, once a massive lifestealing monster, the king of hitting shit and never dieing, his weakness was being some what squishy so you could kill him in CC, now he is the one doing the CCing, as a CC tank (as if we didn't have 100 of those already) and his new weakness, well one of them, is high sustain duelists. He used to be the king of sustain, and now it's his fucking weakness since he doesn't have the damage to do shit to them.\n\nI'm just tired of all the identity reversals in weakness, Riot could have created a shrine maiden champion for their Skarner passive idea, and could have buff one of the current CC tanks instead of changing Sion, but instead they just change an existing one people have already grown to like. It's easy to shrug it off when it's not your champion and the champion is one of the lowest pick rates, but for me, Skarner was a lot of fun, he was a champ I could enjoy and ignore my team looking for picks and shit, now he's a team fighting tank with terrible damage. I mean there is a reason I don't play Amumu or Malphite, why would I want Skarner to be like that?","replies":[{"poster":"Biffolo","date":"2015-09-08T22:00:07.836+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Making a champion viable and able to be played takes the top priority I'd imagine.

Yea sure it's more money, but you've now hurt someone to give others something they didn't really need.\n\nWe already have enough CC tanks, sure there may be more Sion players now but they would have had just as easy of a time with other tanks, they didn't need Sion to be changed, however all those who liked Sions lifestealing playstyle have lost something.\n\nSame thing for Skarner, people don't need current Skarner, he's just a gimmicky, lower damage Blitzcrank, however he used to be a great duelist, and unique, or at least as unique as champions get in this game.","replies":[{"poster":"Biffolo","date":"2015-09-13T02:53:32.220+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Except real money and a competitive game are two entirely different things.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"LaowPing","date":"2015-09-08T04:15:30.268+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"My body is ready, my computer is not.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lucifer","date":"2015-09-07T14:53:44.948+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":6,"body":"Hopefully she can move while casting it, or it won't matter how cool it looks.
