I mean they were right to say that Yi only has 2 skins recently (and one of them was from 2 years ago). It's not wrong, unless you count half a decade ago, 'recent'. Sure it's an okay cycle, and that's about it, and the original commenter said nothing on it, they merely said Yi is not as saturated with new skins releases as some others, which is true. So what's with the comment proving them right in order to disprove them, or something, here? What's going on lol?","replies":[{"poster":"Sharjo","date":"2017-06-01T04:49:22.209+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just wanted to provide historical context to how Yi's skin releases have worked, since the crux of this thread meant he was being complained about for having too many.
