One is a diver/assassin and the other is a vanguard. \n\nYour argument about burst limitation is also idiotic. At no point does a mage have only 300 mana while their costs are that high. Most mages will have 500 mana by level 6 or so when their full rotation becomes available. In theory, yes, mana could limit burst but not in practice. There is no mage whose rotation is limited by mana except maybe Cassieopeia or Ryze and that is because both of their rotations are far longer than any other champions' by design. \n\nThe point of Anivia isn't DPS, Anivia's R is designed to create a large zoning tool that is more for the slow and the instant burst provided by her E than for continuous damage from her R. If she was intended to get a large amount of DPS with her R it would Ground enemies or something to prevent them from simply flashing out of it. \n\nMorgana's Q has 300 base damage and a 90% AP ratio. That is burst. The champion deals large amounts of burst damage from a distance. Any DPS she deals with her W or her R is secondary to her role as a poke/pick mage. \n\nRumble is indeed DPS based, that's why he's never played mid. Same with Ryze. Those champions do not replace the burst role in your team that is provided by your mid laner, they go top and replace a sustained DPS champ. \n\nKennen was absolutely a burst-centric champion until his ultimate was intentionally nerfed to be spread out over a longer period of time. Now he's more of a control mage/diver, I would agree. Still not DPS, his AOE stun is more important than any damage.\n\nBrand is not DPS, that's just dumb. His passive is the only DoT in his kit, every other ability is designed to combo together to blow your opponent to smithereens. E to get the mark, Q to stun, W to burst and then let the passive do the rest, and it comes out in about 1 second, if that. \n\nZyra isn't a mage, she's a support. Her damage has been nerfed repeatedly, she's a disruptor now who focuses on zone control. Her DPS is decent if she's going against two champions who have intentionally low base stats like an ADC and support early game, but she's trash against anyone who is intended to solo lane. \n\nFiddlesticks' goal isn't DPS, he's another zoner like Anivia. \n\nI will concede that Azir, Swain, Casseiopeia, Vladimir, Taliyah, and Heimerdinger are DPS mages. That's not enough of the population to disregard my point about MR pen, the mage role as burst, and the differences between carries and mages. These champions are exceptions that do not conform to the normal role, but they are a tiny fraction of the mage class, nothing more. \n\nNot even considering all the champions you didn't list who ARE clearly burst mages: {{champion:45}} {{champion:1}} {{champion:4}} {{champion:112}} {{champion:101}} {{champion:115}} {{champion:161}} {{champion:134}}","replies":[{"poster":"doiminat0r3600","date":"2017-05-14T02:24:19.486+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"1.

I think it was changed away from that because it doesn't necessarily make it the ideal first item unless it's just that strong. But with its burn being mostly strong for PvE only could still function in a logically balanced and useful spot.\n\nWhat I mean taken more extreme it could have very little health and a huge % bonus and it isn't a good first item but the item every jungle would switch to late game. I do have memories playing Mundo jungle between season 5 and 6 when he was OP at that and getting more mileage from rushing Spirit Visage against enough AP because it had significantly better effective health than cinderhulk.\n\nOfc that is Mundo and SV had 20% cdr back then plus SV is a more expensive item","replies":[]},{"poster":"HolyWarsPunish","date":"2017-05-14T23:42:46.237+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just one question from Riot: ``Are you from LC$?`` . \n\nSo.. no?\n\nOk so no.","replies":[]}]}
