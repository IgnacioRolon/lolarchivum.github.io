That said, the Kernel error you're referring to is usually a permissions issue.  The game needs to access files, but may result in that error when blocked.  In addition to our connection guide, ask him to perform the steps in our [permissions](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) article so his game files will be allowed access.
