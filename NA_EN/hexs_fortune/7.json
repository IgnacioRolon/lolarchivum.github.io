Anyone can opt into movement speed through that secondary Path. Or can opt into Resolve and get early Armor, just as you could get Armor Quint before. You had a choice of what Quint you wanted, you now have a choice of what Secondary Path you want...\n\nLet's be clear: they're condensing 10 lines of old Masteries + 4 types of Runes into 6 new Runes Reforged. That's 14 \"choices\" versus 6, so you won't be able to get just as many combinations, this is obvious. But most of the old \"choices\" were really not choices at all, with obvious right and wrong answers, and your choice of Quint was one of the few stuff that was actually interesting (and even then, not for all Champs), so this clearly should be reflected by choosing at least one of your Runes in the new system. If every of the 6 Runes we have to choose is as compelling a choice as old Quints were, that's clearly a win in my eyes.\n\nAnd from what we've seen until now? We've got clear replacements for the old early defense vs scaling defense that most Yellow/Blue Runes set-up boils down to, we've got CDR options for Champs that really want to spec into it, and this thread here is promising us something about MS. My knowledge of exotic Rune set-ups isn't extensive, but from what I can tell, the only option we won't be offered in the new system is the \"cheese Pages\" with Full MPen or Full Crit Chance, and this is a GOOD thing. And maybe some weird Spell Vamp Quints for Singed or some off-meta Junglers? But in that case, Spell Vamp was just some convoluted way to get early sustain, and I would be surprised if we don't get a Rune about early sustain.\n\n(Also the \"14 versus 6 choices\" bit might be a bit misleading. Some Runes will probably be replaced by Base Stats adjustments, especially the offensive ones.)","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Critmaster Garen","date":"2017-09-03T19:14:44.427+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=JuAPHb2U,comment-id=0012,timestamp=2017-09-03T19:05:32.281+0000)\n>\n> We haven&#x27;t announced it yet I don&#x27;t think, there&#x27;ll be a regular rune though that grants both some % MS from game start and some other stuff in the new system.
