Let's face it though - bad drafts happen.  \n\nWhen a champ just point-clicks and deletes opponents via stats, however, there's little to no mechanical counterplay to that, and that's not great design.  You can't really outsmart that.  You can't bait it, dodge it or turn it around.  It's literally a matter of you dying to point-click if you're in range via stat checks. Like even Zed's damage takes a few moments to go through.

What game have you been playing? That's how it's always been. \n\nThe reverse is far worse: To be functionally immune to the enemy's assaults just because you're under a tower. \nThe game would never end. \n\nNow, granted, I think towers are too weak in general, especially early, but that doesn't make your original argument true. \nYou didn't deserve to be immune to getting dived in that situation for all the reasons I already outlined. And somewhat stronger towers wouldn't have saved you either, for those same reasons I outlined.\n","replies":[{"poster":"Karunamon","date":"2018-06-26T21:39:42.683+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":">The reverse is far worse: To be functionally immune to the enemy's assaults just because you're under a tower.\n\nWhich I didn't ask for. In OP's clip, the attacker took one single tower shot on thier way out, and it's one that probably didn't take more than 10% off their HP, if that.\n\nTowers ought to be bastions of safety that it takes effort to take down, not something you can just mindlessly traipse behind, kill someone, and then get out only taking a single shot.","replies":[{"poster":"Risen29","date":"2018-06-26T21:50:51.338+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Karunamon,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=O3VvXuFv,comment-id=001500000001000000000000,timestamp=2018-06-26T21:39:42.683+0000)\n>\n> Which I didn&#x27;t ask for.

That's your fault, not the game's fault.","replies":[{"poster":"Karunamon","date":"2018-06-26T21:56:03.650+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":">The fact is you shouldn't be alone as an ADC at 20 minutes when you have no mobility or CC and their is a fed assassin on the enemy team.

I remember when \"play passive and farm under tower\" was a legitimate strategy to playing from behind. Now there's nothing? You fall behind and you're doomed because assassins are so bursty and MS heavy they can just blithely ignore everything other than a CC tank?","replies":[{"poster":"Risen29","date":"2018-06-26T22:44:31.126+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Karunamon,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=O3VvXuFv,comment-id=00150000000100000000000000000000,timestamp=2018-06-26T21:56:03.650+0000)\n>\n> So there is no safe place on the map.\n\nThere never has been an absolutely safe space on the map, aside from the fountain. \nYou're living in a fantasy world of shit design if you think an isolated immobile cc-less ADC should have survived getting ganked by a wildly fed rengar during the mid game just because she was under a tower.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"ali afri","date":"2018-06-26T00:00:28.680+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"he is 10/2 , if he cant dive u under tower how he can win the game, kda should be removed so and gold difference dont matters in game, all start with 100k gold level 18 then go in game !","replies":[]}]}]}]}
