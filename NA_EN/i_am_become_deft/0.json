And the lane ends up being ezreal thresh vs. Sivir Morgana. I was kind of worried about the double shield (ezreal is very spell reliant) but I tried to stay optimistic. At the beginning of the game I said \"Sivir can block your q or my q thresh, but she can't block both\". Kayle said \"I like the optimism\". I was happy to have at least one positive teammate. And then we started losing lane, hard. In auto trades she did more damage and it was impossible to q her (double shield). Honestly I ate a few too many morgana bindings, and I'm willing to admit that my mistakes cost us the game. Thresh suddenly started satin things like \"wtf ez\", \"this ez\". And when Kayle Ganked botlane and died (Sivir was already fed at this point) she blamed me because it was free shut down gold. The second half of the game consisted of thresh taking my ca and roaming to other lanes, and the entire time thresh and Kayle are just venting on me. I eventually respond to their harass, which made it much worse, but here's some of what they said.\n\nMe: I'm not the only one making mistakes here\nKayle: Yah but you're really bad\nMe: I thought you were optimistic?\nKayle: I was until I saw how bad you were\nKayle: Hard to be optimistic when you see pure garbage\nKayle: Man this thresh is really good, how did you lose lane so hard?\nThresh: I literally set up every kill for him, and he didn't do anything.\nMe: (After getting the only tower we ever got that game) Well I got a tower, that's more than any of you can do.\nThresh: so bad\n\nEtc. etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis stuff makes me feel sad to my core. Like that feeling of \"heartbreak\" after a relationship ends. What's worse is that Kayle was actually nice at the beginning of the game, so I took some of what she said seriously. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy are people so mean?

I don't care if people think I'm weird or something, but I don't want to spoil other peoples' time. I don't want people to think I'm a bad person or that I'm bad at something. Yeah, it upsets me, and yeah, it embarrasses me. Some people are more sensitive than others. Some people are just COMPLETELY insensitive and don't give a damn about how they make others feel. They're so \"cool.\"\n\nI thought of something funny the other night-- back in the days of arcade gaming, if someone was acting cocky or downright mean like people do online, what would the people physically standing in the room think of that person? They'd laugh. They'd think they're a loser. These toxic players are just fucking losers. If they could see the reactions on peoples' faces, they'd probably care about how much of an idiot they're making themselves look like. But unfortunately, a certain type of person in this world cares about nothing other than their whims. \n\nJust mute them, and seriously, report them. I've noticed the game has become SIGNIFICANTLY less toxic than it was when I first started playing. They're weeding the baddies out. \n\nHonestly, I would not trust the criticism from a person who's flaming you and treating you poorly. I wouldn't assume that that person's a skilled player. Hell, that kind of behavior makes me think the opposite of them. I suppose if you hear the SAME THING over and over, then maybe they're right, but it seems like you know what you did wrong.

Some you had control over, but many you didn't.\n\nFirst - never ever try to engage once the other person starts complaining.  You'll lose that in a hurry even if you try to own up with a \"my bad\" comment.  Your comment that \"I'm not the only one making mistakes\" was an open invitation for Kayle to lash out and once that starts its not uncommon for others to pile on.  That is probably the first mistake you made, but its a big one.\n\nSecond - One big danger on the internet is that it is largely anonymous.  Most people playing LoL had usernames that don't really identify them so there is an easy ability to pretend that you aren't typing insults at a real life person.  You don't know Kayle or Thresh in real life and they don't know you.  It makes it a lot easier for someone to get extremely negative and insulting because there is no expectation of any physical retaliation.  If they were to mouth of like that in real life punches would probably be thrown, but over the internet they feel safe lashing out in anger.\n\nThird - You don't know what kind of day or person the Kayle and Thresh are so there is no way to know why they were so angry.  So again, don't poke the bear once they start getting a bit negative.  Just work on your play.\n\n----\nNow, I haven't looked at any kind of match recap so I can't say what exactly happened, but I noted that you said to Thresh at the start that the double shield would be a potential problem.  This made me think that you had set yourself up a bit.  It sounds like you wanted to run a \"kill lane\" where the goal is to kill the enemy champs 2v2, but from the start you knew that trades were likely to go against you due to the shields Morgana and Sivir could put out.  Then you admit that Morgana was catching you quite often, which suggests you were very aggressive and not keeping minions between you and her.  That suggests that you came to lane with one plan and didn't adjust.  Unfortunately I'm sure Kayle and Thresh caught on to that after the first couple of deaths.  That only firmed up their idea that you were bad rather than playing poorly.\n\nThe only way to fix that is after your first death, don't be too proud to say.  \"My bad\"  And then adjust your play to try to avoid dying that way again.  \n\nI often seem to use my personal experiences in this game as examples.  One recent one that fits this situation goes back to the fact that since Sunday I've played a lot of games with a brand new player.  He's only level 8 right now and obviously still learning.  In many games he comes in with me and other members of my teamspeak community and will be the lowest leveled player by a huge margin.  We make sure to tell anyone from outside the community that he's new and do work to cover for him and coach him.  We've had a couple players get upset, but most have been quite friendly when we explain the situation.  Especially as this player is humble and willing to type \"My bad\" when he does get beat.  A little humility often wards off a chat turning toxic as if you are already willing to admit that you made a mistake its a lot harder for anyone to attack you without feeling like they are kicking someone who is already down.  Most players won't because it just looks bad.\n\nBeyond that all you can do is once the toxicity starts, use mute.

My intention for saying \"she can't dodge both\" was to be positive and lift morale (which works sometimes). You're right I didn't adjust my playstyle and I went for trades even after we were behind. This is mostly due to me feeling immediate pressure from thresh as soon as we started losing. I was afraid that if I played more passive he would flame me more for being useless. I focused on this instead of adjusting my playstyle. This was probably my biggest mistake. I should have just muted or not responded, but instead I engaged in the hate train. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis was an important insight into how I play the game, thank you.","replies":[{"poster":"mvargus","date":"2015-03-05T20:06:26.463+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Glad I could help some.  I know that feeling of \"WTF - how do I deal with the person I'm facing in lane\".  I've ended up taking Annie mid against Riven and I can't count the number of strange bot lane combos I've faced or seen.  \n\nWhat I can suggest for ADC is to remember that early on 6 CS is 105 gold, so if you can just wipe out one wave of minions you got almost as much gold as you do from killing an enemy champ.  I never go to lane thinking \"I'm going to kill the other ADC and support.\"  I'll poke hard if they offer good opportunities and should I get one to 50% health and I know where the jungler is I might try an all-in if my support is ready, but otherwise I try to farm.    I'm not great, as I can't seem to get my CS/min above 6 with any consistency (the pros are above 10), but I try  {Hey, I'm only level 28}.  I peeked at your numbers and saw that you tend to win when you get the CS/min above 7, but the game you described here your CS was at 5/min.  (and I don't think a 1/4/0 KDA is terrible all things considered.)  Also the Sivir you faced appears to play a lot of ADC, and had a CS/min of 10.5 so even if you hadn't died she was farming so fast that she was going to outscale anyone on your team.  (Gold in season 4 and probably trying to get back to their original rank.)\n\nYou ran into a buzzsaw of an opponent and had a bad game, that much is clear now that I peek at the post game stats.  And other than the fact that you died 4 times you were solid compared to the others of your team.  Your gold was equal or greater and you outfarmed anyone on your team.  But the early deaths set off Kayle and when you tried to defend yourself it just set off the toxicity.\n\nI expect if I had been in the lane I'd have gotten crushed faster than you did.  (although I don't play Ezreal, so I can't say for sure, I run Jinx, Sivir and rarely Ashe for ADC)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"sir d wreck","date":"2015-03-05T19:46:56.524+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sir, or Sirette, mute and move on.

It's not all Riot's fault, the newest generation of internet kids are the most entitled, sociopathic generation yet, so they certainly have their hands full.

If you want to avoid this type of behavior completely, then by all means use the mute button and use it early. \n\nSo if I have an extra bad game here is something I like to watch :\n\nAphromoo's Solo Queue Wisdom\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61zfM63v60\n\n\n> [{quoted}](name=SergeantSurgeon,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=qoHfjyAk,comment-id=,timestamp=2015-03-05T15:00:01.856+0000)\n\n> \n> Me: I'm not the only one making mistakes here\n> Kayle: Yah but you're really bad\n> Me: I thought you were optimistic?\n> Kayle: I was until I saw how bad you were\n> Kayle: Hard to be optimistic when you see pure garbage\n> Kayle: Man this thresh is really good, how did you lose lane so hard?\n> Thresh: I literally set up every kill for him, and he didn't do anything.\n> Me: (After getting the only tower we ever got that game) Well I got a tower, that's more than any of you can do.\n> Thresh: so bad\n\nWhatever led to the first line of this conversation was not worth a response. When somebody is just complaining and complaining they are just looking for a comment they can latch onto and attack. I can almost guarantee that if somebody besides thresh* responded  they would probably be attacked by these two. If someone is just fishing for an argument, don't participate in it. It just takes away from your concentration, makes you play worse, and then makes you feel worse for playing worse. If someone is spam complaining, just mute them. If they are being really nasty about it, report them after the game. That is the course of action provided you in this game.\n\n*I say anyone besides thresh because you were playing ranked. When you are playing ranked and two people are going off on someone chances are they are a duo queue. They will back each other up instead of admitting one of them did poorly 9/10 times. Also, there is no use saying \"You are prolly duo.\" They will say they aren't, even if they are.\n\n> \n> Why are people so mean? Why can't people just not be total fuckwads over the internet?\n\nPeople are mean over the internet, in person, and in LoL for many reasons. One of the most prominent reasons people are mean online / in LoL is because of anonymity. You don't know who they are, they don't know who you are, and you will most likely never meet in these circumstances again. Unless you are challenger or high diamond 1 where the player base is a lot smaller.\n\nAs a side note, this is why when you watch Challenger streams and what not, there is generally more laughing (even in all chat) and less flaming. If somebody does flame it is usually the same person and i've even seen people flame one game then apologize **on a later day** because they realized they were being jerks. This is because these players play with each other all the time. That wall of anonymity has broken down as the names and players are more familiar to each other.\n\nIf you are below that ranking though then the chances get much more likely you will not see each other again. So people will just make you the sacrificial lamb for whatever is making them mad. This could be there own bad plays (example that jungle kayle ganking a fed sivir / morgana lane? They are ahead. And nobody is landing CC on those 2. Horrible idea.), maybe they are on a losing streak, maybe they had a bad day at work, they had a test at school they did poorly on, they broke up with their significant other/had a fight, etc... Anything that makes them feel bad, so they turn to league to make themselves feel better. Also, I have found that a lot of players are frustrated due to a lack of understanding about how to alter the situation they are in. With your example, thresh/kayle were on a losing team and did not know what they could do to turn that game around, so instead of admitting they did not know how to win and therefore had room to improve, they just passed the blame onto somebody else who was also not having a good game.\n\nIf you have a bad game, just seek out the areas you could improve on (the best way to do this is via a recording of the game), try your best, and then work to fix those mistakes later. Also, bad games happen.\n\nThis trick actually helps me a lot now. I honestly pretend when people are raging, flaming, etc... that they have probably just had the worst days of their lives. This dude just woke up from a coma after having his leg amputated type of day. They may have just lost their job / spouse. They are having some kind of bad thing happen and they came to LoL to try and feel good. However, they are handling it badly. Report them after game by all means if they are being out of line. But in game I just take it as someone having a tantrum and either mute them or just ignore them in chat.\n\nJust pretend it is one of your friends having a rough day, they took it out on you, and they realize it later and apologize. Except in this case you never have to hear from that jerk again!! :}\n\nWork on your own play, play with people who help you build up your confidence, and once you have that confidence this stuff won't bother you as much.
