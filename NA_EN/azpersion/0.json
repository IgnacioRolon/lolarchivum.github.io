Client was working fine, I was able to go through champ select and everything. \n\nWhen the game launched, I was taken to a white screen. So I hit (alt+enter) and it took me to the normal game loading screen. Only difference here was that the summoner borders were present, but no champion splash art, summoner spells, nor the little indices that showed how far along a player had loaded their game.\n\nIt stayed like this for ten frustrating minutes - how I do not know as I assume the game was immediately aborted and \"remade\".\n\nI tried in vain to restart the client, restart my computer, reinstall the client, absolutely nothing solved this issue. Just blank borders.\n\n\nOnce the game finally ended, I tried to open a game with the \"practice tool\" This also failed.\n\n\nAnyone have insight to this?\n\nAlso my computer is a Macbook Pro with OS X Yosemite 10.10.5","replies":[{"poster":"Son of Ornn","date":"2017-05-28T04:30:39.054+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"At first I was concerned it could be related to some known Mac issues we're still working on, but after running it by Tech real fast I'm pretty convinced something was just interrupting the game's connection.\n\nLet's start by troubleshooting that using [**this guide here**](http://riot.com/12B7oac). There are a lot of steps, but if you can follow through with them it will solidify connection for LoL and eliminate that as a potential cause of the problem. Make sure to test these fixes in a Custom game setting only; don't want you getting any LPQ's before we find a fix. Keep in touch with me on if it helps out or not! ^^","replies":[]}]}
