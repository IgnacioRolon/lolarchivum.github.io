I strongly recommend doing either of those and if you continue to have issues, work through our [connection guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues). Issues with patching after 32% are almost always caused by a poor connection to the patching servers.\n\nLet me know if you continue to have issues.","replies":[{"poster":"Gdawgs755","date":"2016-10-06T18:22:09.358+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeah I uninstalled AVG and boom the patcher worked.
