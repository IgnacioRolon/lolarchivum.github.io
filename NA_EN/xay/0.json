It's not that doing that is \"unethical\" in any way, the game just likely isn't going to work correctly unless it's installed on your default drive.\n\nMy biggest suggestion for you is to completely reinstall League onto your default hard drive, where it's performance will be much better and more reliable. You also shouldn't have shortcut issues going forward if the game is installed in the proper place.","replies":[{"poster":"KimTachibana","date":"2017-10-12T22:06:07.819+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It worked before though, why'd it change now and why must we be forced to have a shortcut?
