I made sure every background processes were deactivated, I made sure to uninstall all the League of Legends related programs I had (skin apps and voice over) I always make sure the auto-update for games or windows update are off. I tried turning my phone off but it changes nothing, I checked with my siblings, but they are not doing anything significant to ping spike, YouTube videos, Facebook, Twitch does not affect the ping at all ever since we got the new fast wifi, so I doubt that's the problem, the only way the ping is affected is when someone is downloading/uploading something but no one is doing so when I am playing because I make sure I check no one is and then test the ping on Custom Game so I don't want to/can't play LoL because lag really tilts me and I end up losing some hair :/ And I also made sure to set LoL on high priority out of desperation but it does not do anything. It literally happened out of nowhere, it started about a few days ago, I was playing Annie with 265 ping and after 15 minutes or so, the lag spike hit me, I thought it was temporary because it happens sometimes but it was going on for too long so I checked with my siblings who were the only ones at home apart from me but they were not doing anything, I checked my phone and there was nothing happening on the phone, I even turned it off and asked my siblings to turn it off but nothing changed, the ping was constantly on 369 like not even moving, just 369 sometimes would go down to 368 then go right back up to 369, at this point the game is not even playable, your champion is teleporting to places you clicked about 3 seconds ago, minions become r%%%%%s, your abilities are delayed by 3 seconds and adding the lag spike the game eventually becomes hateful. But I love this game and I really want to play it. If there are any solutions you could provide or explanation I would really appreciate it.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-22T20:48:04.403+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A change in your network or how your ISP routes to the game servers may be causing an increase in ping.
