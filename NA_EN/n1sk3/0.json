Does Karthu's ult do splash damage? The same way as Ashe and Jinx ult do splash damage.\n\nOn the Wikia it's stated as a:\n\nType: Area of Effect.\n\nIf people would clarify this it would be rather helpful.","replies":[{"poster":"QuadraBananas","date":"2019-04-28T23:17:54.180+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"it say aoe only because it hit more than 1 player. its more like 5 single target attack","replies":[]},{"poster":"Akenero","date":"2019-04-28T23:14:37.541+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"it does not, unless you have luden's echo, it's just a visual effect.{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}} glad to see you're interested in the guy though, we need more karthus players in the world.","replies":[{"poster":"N1SK3","date":"2019-04-29T01:03:48.602+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"No way in hell i play that champ.

Each targetable champion is targeted for that damage. Each of those strikes does _not_ also hit more things around its target. Have you really never noticed that there's no \"splash\" damage around each enemy champion?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jinzo Torrance","date":"2019-04-29T21:17:15.503+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Karthus Ult is an AoE spell and it is treated as such.\n\nIf Karthus channels his ultimate while you're dead and you respawn one seconds before his ult cast finishes, you will not see the usual Ultimate's green beam indicator over you but you will still take the damage from it -- That's because the ultimate it's coded as a **map-wide AoE** that can only hit champions after it finishes casting.\n\nAsking if it splashes doesn't make sense, as every enemy champion is hit by it after the cast finishes, it doesn't hit one champion and then splashes to the others.","replies":[]},{"poster":"bluefire mark 2","date":"2019-04-29T02:56:08.539+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"His r hits multiple targets seperately, but if they stand close each ult will only hit the individual.

This is so that items like Gunblade don't heal him for **massive** amounts of health just because he pressed R.\n\nA similar thing is found on Kai'sa's Q and Ahri's W, although those abilities function differently, they're marked as AoE so they don't heal insane amounts of health from spellvamp.\n\nTechnically, Riot should split it into two categories with separate names, but since they'd be identical categories anyways, there's not much point in that.","replies":[]},{"poster":"N1SK3","date":"2019-04-29T21:49:15.041+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for all the answers. I was sure that it did splash. It was probably either a Luden's Echo along iwth a Liandry's Torment going off or just getting hit after the initial cast and respawn.","replies":[]}]}
