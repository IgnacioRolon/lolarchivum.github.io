Riot help.","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I recently only put a link to a website that actually does give you free skins which is Gamekit where you can redeem a lot of stuff for playing games including League of Legends skins in this thread. This was my post.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/X0GL2lr.jpg\n\nThen I got this message from Riot.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/JdAnQn5.jpg\n\nI have done literally nothing else and I got this message I put in the link. Then afterwards logging into my account I am getting this message.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/ONc3mEX.jpg\n\n\nDear Riot,\n\nThe website I linked is not even harmful, phishing or hacking/theft related in any way and many have linked to it in various places in the past without trouble. It is not a scam either as both me and other people have redeemed stuff from it and had it delivered in the past.\n\nI am a player who has never been suspended, I have never abused or been toxic, was honor level 4 and almost 5, got free skin for good behavior in Season previously. I would never in my rightful mind do anything that goes directly against Riot's Summoner Code. The content I posted was to help myself and some other fellow member get free skins but in a legit way as you can check yourself, the website I linked to is in no way harmful.\n\nLet us assume it was an offense which it is not... I was given 1 warning after which I did nothing... the most that should have been done in this case was a temporary ban.\nI have done nothing harmful to the users of this game and the community or to Riot...\nunder what reason have I been considered so severely harmful that I have been permanently banned?\n\nPlease help me on this Riot. I believe I have been undeservingly punished or punished way too hard.\n\nI created a ticket but no reply from there are after 2 tries. This is way too uncalled for and harsh. I have never even been toxic in the game and played the game with rightful cheer. Help me Riot. :( {{item:3073}} {{item:3073}} ","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-07T22:40:19.164+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It doesn't look like your account is actually banned, merely suspended due to some suspicious activity taking place.

Posting more tickets/replies will bump you down to the end of the queue. Just patiently wait for a reply.\n\nFurther, if you are looking for free skins, it's likely you clicked on a phishing website at some point. Likely, this resulted in you inputting your username/password on what *looked* like an official Riot site, but in reality was just to steal your account. That's why they locked it - until you prove ownership of the account.","replies":[{"poster":"SuperShadonic","date":"2017-09-08T00:52:32.803+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am well aware of scams and phishing links and instantly recognize them.\nMy username is same across everything but...\nMy LOL Account has 1 Password different and unique.\nMy Emails have another 2nd password unique password.\nAnd everything else I use have a 3rd unique password.\n\nEven if I am signing up on any website, I will use the 3rd unique password not similar to LOL or my email.\n\nMoreover, I never put my username or password of LOL in any other website accept to Log in to LOL or to LOG in to LOL forums or Support Ticket for LOL.\n\nBtw... I made 3 tickets and one has 5 posts from me... how long do you think I have to wait... Star Guardian Invasion is not gonna stay forever.

It's not that easy to see them. Ever get a \"free RP\" link that took you to a login page that looked like Riot's, but then kept saying wrong password? Or similar?\n\nBottom line is they saw some suspicious activity, and you'll get the account back once they can prove it's yours.","replies":[{"poster":"FNC kcal12","date":"2017-09-09T01:29:39.108+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Personally, a phishing website is so easy to recognize. not just from the layout/graphics, or spelling , but also with the lock on the upper left, and other stuff. only kids or people who don't know a computer too much would fall for that.","replies":[{"poster":"Chermorg","date":"2017-09-09T02:49:50.606+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://www.wired.com/2017/03/phishing-scams-fool-even-tech-nerds-heres-avoid/\n\nhttp://www.phishing.org/phishing-examples\n\nThose Google and Adobe sites look almost perfect.\n\nEven people that literally have PhDs in computer science or information technology related fields fall for phishing.\n\nI have seen some damn good phishing of Riot sites in my day.","replies":[{"poster":"FNC kcal12","date":"2017-09-09T10:47:42.446+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thx fr the links bro i'll go read that ^^","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"SuperShadonic","date":"2017-09-08T02:45:07.963+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually a guy posted a phishing link to me which I did not put my username and password in some time ago.\n\nBut I reported that guy to Riot through ticket. My account could not have been compromised because I never put my login and pw info on that page.\n\nThere is I think a possibility that Riot is still taking measures with my account making sure I had never put any info into that phishing page and checking whether someone else has logged into my account and such stuff just to make sure everything is okay.\n\nI can post the entire chat history between me and that guy which also clearly shows I read him and knew his trap from the start and never fell for it, however... the only reason I am not posting it right now because that includes another Summoner talking to me and I am not sure if it is okay to link private chats here and if it would go against Summoner's Code. I am just scared what if it makes my account situation worse by giving me an actual offense because I think my account may not have been suspended due to the link I posted as it was unharmful.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
