What kind of justice is this?\n\nI keep encountering tons of scripters which usually my entire team agree upon as they seem to be avoiding multiple skillshots from different directions in small narrow spaces till the end of the game not getting hit by one.... those people are running rampant.\n\nAnd then you have guys like me who haven't done a wrong thing since Season 2 when he created his account... and he's banned for free from playing a mode he waited so long for.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SuperShadonic","date":"2017-09-09T17:11:41.546+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would appreciate that.

The 404 error link is odd, what url was it navigating to?  I recommend using our [account recovery form](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=72416), but you can also email us via support@riotgames.com.  Just be sure to reference any previous ticket numbers you've had, and we'll dig deeper to help!","replies":[]}]}
