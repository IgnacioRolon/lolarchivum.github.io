I havnt really dug deep into it or anything. Well to the point... i guess. I got rewarded with a skin that i have been really proud of having, meaning i already owned it (urfwarwick). Which it is fine if you can obtain any of the old EXCLUSIVE skins and all, including pax tf, if you can obtain all of them now, but at least put it in the skin loot so i can deconstruct it since i already paid money for it. just saying in a matter of fact, it would be nice.","replies":[]}
