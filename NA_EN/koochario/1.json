I&#039;d rather take the flame than live in this box where almost anything can be taken as toxic. I realize some players are too sensitive to deal with the world without censorship and an overactive punishment system. That&#039;s fine. Let them play their game but give me a totally unmoderated chat mode as well. I&#039;m not a 13 year old kid. I&#039;m an adult and I can handle it. What I find way worse is not being able to discuss even strategy or to use arguments and logic without being in fear of a punishment. The chat is just useless. I can&#039;t even say &quot;report our inter&quot; when a player is 0/17 or &quot;report our afk&quot; if someone&#039;s been gone for 15 minutes. Yeah, maybe people would report anyway but it&#039;s just silly that even the most egregious offenses cannot be discussed. It&#039;s like having a big bear in the room eating all your chocolates and you just change the channel on the TV and tell yourself *he&#039;s not here*.\r\n\r\nI want to improve and I want to play with people who take competition seriously. I don&#039;t want to play with these low ELO high EGO types of players who can&#039;t handle any feedback and even find calls &quot;toxic&quot; because they don&#039;t want to be &quot;bossed around.&quot; They can take their thin skins and emotional problems to a separate mode that doesn&#039;t let anyone say shit to them. That&#039;s fine by me. Just give the OPTION of an unmoderated full toxic chat experience. Still ban people for inting, punish afkers etc. but leave the chat for adults. Maybe you can have this mode require permission to use if you&#039;re afraid of kids dealing with it. It feels so childish right now to not be able to communicate anything but the most bland and positive statements. Again, keep your automated bot and whatever else you want, but LET ME HAVE MY GAME BACK! Let players express themselves and speak their mind.","replies":[{"poster":"Xonra","date":"2018-05-03T22:53:44.315+0000","up_votes":22,"down_votes":8,"body":"You don't need to be toxic or an ass to \"express yourself\".\n\nYou shouldn't be able to randomly speak your mind when it is just cutting other people down and flaming people.

When people see you swear, they just think \"this guy's having a bad day, whatever\". On the other hand, when they blame someone unfairly and have their whole argument deconstructed and exposed, they hate you because you see through their BS. Because what you say is true and well supported, it pisses them off way more than calling them a dumbass. It's exactly when their scapegoating and ego protective defenses fail them that they lash out. If you use profanity, you never even enter the realm of being able to annoy them because you're just dismissed as an idiot or a person who can't keep his cool. It's the rational responses that people rebel against and that's where the bot fails the most.","replies":[{"poster":"Pandemic Punch","date":"2018-05-04T01:14:12.250+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Stinrygar,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=VPm8RGEZ,comment-id=00000001,timestamp=2018-05-03T23:04:04.954+0000)\n>\n> What you don&#x27;t realize is that the players who are most logical in their comments and defend themselves with facts or analysis, not retaliation, are the ones who get reported the most. \n\nEXACTLY","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Opdí","date":"2018-05-03T23:05:09.463+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":9,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Umbral Regent","date":"2018-05-03T23:08:41.948+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"> I'll just chargeback all of the RP you stole from me and find a different game.\n\nYou have fun with being charged with fraud.

You can &quot;express yourself&quot; without needing to be toxic about it.\n\nIt could be a way to punish toxic players but I think it should also just be an optional mode. If you're toxic and getting reported a lot in the regular mode, it probably should just put you in the unrestricted one. It doesn't have to be toxic necessarily but it would just be allowing you full freedom of expression without having to think about every word you type so that you make sure you can't possibly offend anyone.\n\nThe best part is that Riot gets more money since toxic players would still play. The worst part of the system now is that when you get flamed, you can't even say anything back to defend yourself. I'm not talking about actually being toxic, but even factual stuff. For example, let's say top blames the jungle as usual. I'm not even sure if I can type \"you got solo killed 3x before their jungler came\".  It violates all my instincts related to fairness. I can't use facts and arguments to expose hypocrisy or unfair criticism. That's why this mode is needed. Instead, I have to be silently annoyed at the ridiculousness of the blame/comment coming from this player. Maybe I mute but either way, it feels totally unfair. I don't even want him punished. I just want to be able to express my side of the story and that's apparently too much.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RiftScuttlerOP","date":"2018-05-04T00:25:49.676+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Xonra,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=VPm8RGEZ,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-05-03T22:53:44.315+0000)\n>\n> You don&#x27;t need to be toxic or an ass to &quot;express yourself&quot;.\n> \n> You shouldn&#x27;t be able to randomly speak your mind when it is just cutting other people down and flaming people.

And the thing ruining it for me personally aint trolls or \"toxic\" people but those giving up or crying about someone trolling so much that they turn literally worse than actual troll.\nAnd even though it isnt what OP might have asked. But yea i DO ask for more toxicity. For good healthy toxicity. Instead of people sitting there in silence i would prefer easy going atmosphere with people talking shit. \n\n>you really enjoy playing with dudes tilting every 2 mins, saying stupid shit as noob team, u so bad, report feeder, /all pls team report xxx, PLUS everything their frustated ego could come up with, in an unmoderated environment?\n\nThats what they are doing right now. Nothing changed. \nWhat i want is - not so long ago i had support on enemy team. All game she was doing only one thing - trying to tilt my ADC. Me and ADC wanted to honor her for that dedication. Thats what i want. (btw i did that as well for 3 years before i got banned. ah i miss good old times)\n\n\n People talking shit and provoking each other. Instead of sucking it up and shaking from anger for entire game - actually saying that he is dumbest {{champion:62}}  when he fucks up and be done with it. And jungler instead of getting horrified by that insane level of toxicity saying - \"aye dude\" And laugh it off. When enemies make shitty play - TAUNT THEM FOR THAT LIKE NO TOMORROW. I guess you would not understand the feeling of trash talking enemy team or even your own, especially when you are in premade. You do that and think \"lol if i fuck up now that would be so embarrasing :D\"  FFS pro players BM during championships more than average league player can tolerate without reporting something -_-","replies":[{"poster":"Sir Prepuzius","date":"2018-05-04T15:14:09.932+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=remakoro,realm=EUNE,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=VPm8RGEZ,comment-id=001500000000000000000000,timestamp=2018-05-04T14:57:42.313+0000)\n>\n>\n> I just dont understand how you can call one of the best online gaming communities\n\nDude.\n\nYOU WIN\n\nno really. you destroyed me.

If more adults prefer it, it might actually be less toxic. People don't like censorship and thought control in a video game and they also don't like toxicity but sometimes the former is worse than the latter. Serious players or just those wanting to be able to have banter again may very well prefer an unmoderated mode and have way more enjoyment. You don't have to play it if you don't want. KR's server is like this. It's basically unmoderated and \"toxic.\" Many people want that freedom.","replies":[{"poster":"Elohaven","date":"2018-05-04T01:37:12.327+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"No - it's a mode promoting toxicity.

It's not actively encouraged and players who engage in it will still likely lose more games by annoying their teams. The difference is jut that it allows you to say anything you like in chat. If you're not a jerk, it doesn't mean you have to become one. You just don't have to worry about things being taken out of context and used against you or some oversensitive player being incapable of handling criticism.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"remakoro","date":"2018-05-04T10:16:41.423+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"We are having toxic environment.
