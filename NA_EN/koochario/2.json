Sometimes it feels like people just want to do more and make it way worse. Even when it&#039;s neutral, the investment cost makes it very bad (as does the instability and inability to rely on the foundation/skills/prefer ed builds/theory-crafting). Neutral changes are not neutral in their impact on players. You don&#039;t see other sports have random rule changes or rehashes just because someone thinks they&#039;re a creative genius. Basketball is more or less the same now as a decade ago, so is soccer, so is tennis, so is nearly everything. \n\nChange for the sake of change makes people unable to trust or invest in the game. Their effort and skill is not properly rewarded. It becomes exhausting. There should be some sort of end goal where near perfect balance is reached and a meta evolves organically with many viable options and strategies.","replies":[{"poster":"Tomoe Gozen","date":"2018-07-01T16:47:00.624+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"I make it a point to completely ignore anything titled \"Why i quit\".\nIt's honestly become a buzzword to generate views and controversy instead of providing fair criticism.\n\nThe very first few minutes of the video where he said \"Riot makes changes for the sake of change\", i immediately tuned out knowing full well he is going to start talking out of his ass. And on top of that, he said that he didn't play League for quite a while and now i'm supposed to take his word that he knows what he's talking about, without actually being kept in the loop of League's changes and having played the game during that time?\nGive me break.\n\nPeople quit all the time.\nLet's not pretend like losing a streamer/youtuber means that League is not fun anymore. I watched League YTbers way back in the day and many of them simply vanished without a trace/changed the type of content they provide on their channels.","replies":[{"poster":"Nenthos","date":"2018-07-01T16:59:25.978+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Let's not also pretend there are no glaring problems with the game. While people do \"quit all the time\", there ARE _alot more people quitting then usual_ and that does warrant being looked into. You seem to just cherry pick whatever you like and dismiss any type of viable criticism someone can make; and that type of attitude pisses me off because we can't have a proper discussion on the subject. How about not using the term \"let's not pretend\" to everyone else, and use it on yourself first?","replies":[{"poster":"Sp33d Zer0","date":"2018-07-02T07:50:48.526+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Where are the numbers to back up \"more people quitting than usual\"?\nLast I checked Riot stopped releasing their active player numbers in season 3.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Madsin25","date":"2018-07-01T02:14:24.078+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":2,"body":"Agree with most except voice chat. \n\nPart of climbing in solo q is having the skill to climb without much communication from your team. \n\nJust my opinion.","replies":[{"poster":"2Charmnot2Charm","date":"2018-07-01T21:34:09.046+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I agree, that was the main reason I used to refuse to duo with anyone till the game got so frustrating this season that I stopped caring all together.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Toxicate13","date":"2018-07-01T01:50:05.569+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree, but on a side note, it's funny how some posts like this get upvotes, and other posts like this, that are worded a little bit differently, get spammed with downvotes","replies":[{"poster":"NA Darklarik","date":"2018-07-01T23:30:04.666+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Toxicate13,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=AUfTvdgL,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-07-01T01:50:05.569+0000)\n>\n> I agree, but on a side note, it&#x27;s funny how some posts like this get upvotes, and other posts like this, that are worded a little bit differently, get spammed with downvotes\n\nIt just goes to show how important paragraph construction is to get your idea through to people.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TouchFluffyTail","date":"2018-07-01T17:55:29.060+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"And another ex-league youtuber explains why Ahri is awful = - = I just hope Riot finally gives her any kind of buffs.
