Could you fucking not blow half your ults on him while solely trying to kill him during a fight while the Riven murders the backline?","replies":[{"poster":"IcyPepper","date":"2015-09-13T07:32:06.693+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Imo, if Alistar tries diving the backline it should be the support's duty to cc him (it's their role to protect the backline, and you want your mage/tank to save their rotations for priority targets. It's not just ults, it's cc wasted in teamfights that leads to Katarina pentakills). If he doesn't attempt to go for the backline, he's not going to do much other than reposition your frontline (which can be lethal in a teamfight, so be careful). His ult isn't useful if you don't focus him, so don't be in a position he can benefit from that.","replies":[{"poster":"For Carthage","date":"2015-09-13T08:39:47.870+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you.
