And I can explain precisely why.\n\nCurrently we&#039;re in the teamfight meta - the reason ADC&#039;s were nerfed was because they became so aggressively strong that they were basically 1v1&#039;ing everyone and winning.  But why suddenly, out of nowhere, would they just start roflstomping their way through entire teams?  Only a few had received buffs or changes within that time frame, so what gives?\n\nWell, let&#039;s take a look at where they were coming fresh out of with zero changes - the assassin meta, the time period where being an ADC was probably the worst thing to ever be because one wrong move and you popped like a balloon in a tack factory.  ADC&#039;s _had_ to be a bit stronger in this meta because if they weren&#039;t, they were going to be useless, which would translate to **weeeeeeeeeeee assassins in every lane yeah woohoo.**  And good god is that just a nightmare (I&#039;ve played against that team - while eventually they could be beaten, the game was so unenjoyable we just didn&#039;t).\n\nWell, jump forward to season 5 and find the teamfight meta where all assassins suddenly receive a massive nerf - suddenly, ADC&#039;s are exploding.  Why?  **Because they weren&#039;t touched during that time period.** So all the nerfs since then have basically been fixing that rise in strength because once it started becoming about the teamplay rather than blowing up the enemy carries as quickly as possible, the power all shifted to ADC&#039;s as teams desperately build to peel for them and put all their faith and damage in them.  And boy could they dish it out.\n\nADC&#039;s don&#039;t need buffs by and large because they&#039;re starting to function as they really should - they shouldn&#039;t be able to 1v1 their way out of situations, but with teamwork they wind up pumping out the most damage.  No, Jinx should not be able to sit there with her minigun and kill a J4 point-blank who has unleashed his whole combo and has itemized correctly.  No, Vayne should not be able to 1v1 _literally everyone in the game_ and come out victorious.  It&#039;s like having a catapult in Civilization - it&#039;s the only way you&#039;re going to do major damage to a city, but there&#039;s no way that the enemy shouldn&#039;t be able to destroy it if you leave it just sitting there by itself in the open.\n\nSo that&#039;s why you don&#039;t need to buff the other ADC&#039;s to match Vayne or Jinx - because they&#039;re working as intended late-game.  They&#039;re high-damage but have an equal vulnerability, and that&#039;s how it&#039;s meant to be.  Granted, a couple (like Miss Fortune) may need some buffs to their later game, and a couple (like Twitch) may need their laning phase tweaked up a bit to be able to even make it to their late-game ever.  But other than that, all you have to do is bring Vayne down from her damn pedestal and probably take a look at Jinx as well.  Stop dancing around the issue as if ADC&#039;s are shit and realize that the only reason most of them are bad is because two or three are so heavily dominant in their laning phase that it&#039;s impossible to see the others&#039; potential since they just can&#039;t match up.","replies":[{"poster":"disregardable","date":"2015-09-13T10:58:14.306+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":37,"body":"Don't even have to read it.

His Q also shreds armor.\n\nIn short, if a full-squish Jinx is just sitting there saying \"Come at me\" to a J4, then there's not a way in hell that she can 1v1 because he was meant to take out people like that.  Again, it's a catapult - massive damage, extremely vulnerable.\n\nI also don't particularly main a role, thanks.  I jump around all the time.  I'm speaking from playing MF and averaging 15/6/10 - I don't play her every single game, no.  But I consistently did the most damage and had the most kill participation as what is hailed as the worst ADC in the game right now in nearly every game with her.  And if she's the worst - if I'm dominating with the worst ADC in the game, then how can you call ADC's the \"weakest and most impactful role\"?  There's a reason they're called the \"Attack Damage Carry\" role - because they carry their damage.  But they're weak early game because having one role clearly dominant to every other role would mean that they'd just be _the_ meta - they'd be in every role doing everything because they'd just be better.  The reason people think they're weak is because they get destroyed by themselves and that's how it's supposed to be.\n\nLook at it this way: You're playing Rome: Total War.  You have nothing but an army of archers.  Why are you getting pissed when the enemy cavalry mow you all down in seconds? You should have a spear unit - a frontline - to protect them so they can wreak havoc.

Reason is, in team fights, when she gets focused, she enters stealth, forcing the enemy to engage someone else, or do nothing while waiting for her to re-appear.\n\nMy problem is Lucian compared to Vayne. Yes Lucian has poke, but it is only good in lane. Outside of lane Lucian falls off really badly. Now riot nerfed his range to 500 and seem to intend to keep it that way. Simply because he has a dash that should keep him safe. The thing is, even when I dash away, I still die as ppl like Yi are too fast and stick on me. Ppl like Elise have targeted dash and stick on me where as Vayne has much better disengage tools.\n\n\nNow I'm not saying give Lucian stealth, but if riot wants him that close to combat, then a short range dash/ speed buff from his W  is not enough.\n\nI know you going to say, what about immobile ADCs. Ash has a stun/slow, Varus has snare/slow. Kog has good range/poke and possible access to zhonyas. MF, could use some help on her ult as it should work as a deterrent but does so little damage. I think Twich is fine as he can position himself well and has huge range from ult.","replies":[]}]}
