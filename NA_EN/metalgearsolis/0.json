I've tried uninstalling countless times and reinstalling, but every time I launch the client, it does the same thing and won't run/launch. It just brings up that screen that covers up my monitor screen. Is there any fix for this or am I screwed over when the legacy client switches over to the new client?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-19T18:40:05.866+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately, I'm not current with alpha issues or this particular problem.  Hit up our [Alpha boards ](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/AMiK4QqL-alpha-client-wont-work)so fellow testers and dev can look into this.  Good luck!","replies":[]}]}
