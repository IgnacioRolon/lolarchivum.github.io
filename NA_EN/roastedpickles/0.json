Cant select any champs so i cant play","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello, I'm level 5 and found my self playing the game till 3 am because i was enjoying it so much. Now none of the starter champs are showing up in the select list but what i think are the free weekly ones are. When i go to select any of them it wont let me and tells me to try again. Since i cant select any one i get booted and then get sent into queue hell.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-13T18:28:19.750+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is really strange to hear...So you're not getting any champions to show up at all?  I'm thinking this could be an issue with some bad game files, as you should still have access to free champions.  Just in case, download the [hextech repair tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367) and perform a repair.  Test it out in a custom game to see if any champs come up so you don't get any penalties.  Let me know the results!","replies":[]}]}
