Looking at it&#039;s former use it was an item to counter excessive **Poke** in the **Laning Phase** or to give **Mana Sustain** to **Champions** which usually don&#039;t rush **Tear** {{item:3070}} (since the would start of with a **Sapphire Crystal** {{item:1027}} most of the times). \nHowever, in the momentary stage of the game **Corrupting Potion** {{item:2033}} has become a massively overused Item in **Top- and Midlane**. Especially with the **Time Warp Tonic Rune** it is able to grant **Sustain** to those who usually have a rather weak **Laning Phase**. \n\n\nAs a **Toplane** player, I am quite disappointed about that since it makes some **Lanes** quite boring, since outtrading your opponent will just end in them popping a **Corrupting Potion** {{item:2033}} and being nearly full-life afterwards. In adittion to that **Corrupting Potion** {{item:2033}} grants a huge damage boost in the early levels. \n\n\nThe champions that I often see with this item has grown to a huge number, some of them abusing that item insanely well: _Aurelion Sol_ {{champion:136}}, _Azir_ {{champion:268}} , _Ekko_ {{champion:245}} , _Fiddlesticks_ {{champion:9}} , _Fiora_ {{champion:114}} , _Fizz_ {{champion:105}} , _Galio_ {{champion:3}} , _Gangpank_ {{champion:41}} , _Heimerdinger_ {{champion:74}} , _Irelia_ {{champion:39}} , _Jax_ {{champion:24}} , {{champion:43}} _Karma_ {{champion:43}} , _Kassadin_ {{champion:38}} , _LeBlanc_ {{champion:7}} , _Lissandra_ {{champion:127}} , _Malphite_ {{champion:54}} , _Malzahar_ {{champion:90}} , _Maokai_ {{champion:57}} , _Nasus_ {{champion:75}} , _Olaf_ {{champion:2}} , _Ornn_ {{champion:516}} , _Pantheon_ {{champion:80}} , _Poppy_ {{champion:78}} , _Rumble_ {{champion:68}} , _Singed_ {{champion:27}} , _Sion_ {{champion:14}} , _Swain_ {{champion:50}} , _Taliyah_ {{champion:163}} , _Talon_ {{champion:91}} , _Teemo_ {{champion:17}} , Twisted Fate {{champion:4}} , Urgot {{champion:6}} , Veigar {{champion:45}} , _Vel&#039;Koz_ {{champion:161}} , _Viktor_ {{champion:112}} , _Xerath_ {{champion:101}} , _Zoe_ {{champion:142}} and _Zyra_ {{champion:143}} .\n \n\nI don&#039;t want to express that all those champions are overpowered or abuse **Corrupting Potion** {{item:2033}} well, I just want **Riot** to notice how many champions are already using (some more often, some less often) **Corrupting Potion** {{item:2033}} as a **Starting Item** and how it massively decreases the effort some champions have to put into the **Laning Phase** to succeed. \n\n\nAs the item has become that overused I personally would be glad to see the Item get a nerf in the near future. \n**Please post your opinions and thoughts in the comments and take part in the poll. **\n\n\n\nSincerely, Capitalism FTW.\n\n{{sticker:garen-swing}}","replies":[{"poster":"Hethalean","date":"2018-10-15T13:15:25.114+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I honestly think the problem is Time Warp Tonic rather than Corrupting Potion.","replies":[{"poster":"Séance","date":"2018-10-15T13:22:18.070+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"TWT just got nerfed on pbe, so i think riot agrees.","replies":[{"poster":"Hethalean","date":"2018-10-15T13:24:10.984+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=little smurf row,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=wQvkLtbv,comment-id=00010001,timestamp=2018-10-15T13:22:18.070+0000)\n>\n> TWT just got nerfed on pbe, so i think riot agrees.\n\nOh, thanks for the heads up!
