The tidbits Riot gave out [in exchange for trampling over old promises] were not worth the loss of that value, in my opinion (and I doubt I'm alone in that belief— I witnessed the community's backlash).\n\nI'm not sure why some skins (the old PAX skins, Rusty Blitzcrank, etc. — non-earned skins) were exempt from the change; the same reasons given for making the limited skins that were made into legacy skins also applied to these skins. They were not earned, and they would be appreciated by newer members of the community (if only for their value as old novelties), yet they were treated differently. The exemption for Victorious skins makes sense; the exemption of these \"other\" skins does not. Even if the PAX skins were given away for free, they were still effectively purchased because it costs money to attend PAX, does it not?","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-07-24T23:26:13.852+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"The PAX skins were meant to be a memento for players who attended PAX.

Give the players an option of choosing a skin that falls into this bracket. This can lead to a player never being able to have all of them (because they haven't been playing since the beginning) but they get a little more freedom on the skin they earn.\nYou can take it a step further and give them the opportunity to earn multiple skins if they can maintain an <X> tier in multiple brackets (Solo, 5's, 3's) until they have all skins in this bracket. Those truly dedicated to the mastery of the game will put in the work, showing they have earned it and no bad feelings beyond an elitist attitude of \"I've been playing longer than you pleb\" should be lingering. \nYou've already kinda set the stage for being able to do that by periodically opening the vault for skins at certain times per year (and rewarding people who already the content with something extra, extra RP, unique Ribbon, A Chroma Pack, even a High Five might be enough for some players) so we see you aren't against that in theory\n\n \nFor the PAX/Pre-Order events the skins signify that you have/had the discretionary income to either go to an event or jump on the bandwagon on a new game and that's all those skins show.\nThe PAX skins can easily be solved by something similar to how Blizzard does unique content for Blizzcon and WoW/D3 and the unique content can still be obtained by doing an e-ticket to the event. The people who want the experience of the con will still go to the con, but the people who just want the content or are unable of going to the event can still be included with a comparable monetary investment.\n\nThis leaves only the King Rammus skin, which you can only earn if you if you played since Beta.\nNot sure how to provide the community a solution for this but it's a status symbol of significantly supporting the game.\nMaybe meaningful content contributions ala PBE over a timeline?\nIt is incentive to use the PBE for testing/bug finding/polling the community instead of just early access to content. \nEven make it hinging on good social standing both on their PBE and Live accounts and make it a skin hinging on maintaining good standing/PBE?\n\nJust spitballin' ideas","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-07-24T17:13:46.218+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're right - this is a pretty hot topic, especially for Victorious skins, and we're nearing that time of year again! \n\n> Since we're able to earn skins for reaching <X> tier bracket at the end of each season.

The people who have maintained their ability across the seasons, assuming you adopted the proposed solution,  'technically' had this option all along with only  one choice. This lead to the system streamlining it and automatically awarding it to the player.\n\nAt best you have the crowds who joined in Season N, earned their Y ranking but wanting Season N-X rewards that would have bad feelings (Also assuming you disregard the attitude of seniority elitism levels of salt.) These people have the opportunity to earn their skin they want.\n\nAm I missing the base point there, or is this a party line you have to give?\n\n> These fall into a bit of a different category since they were previously available in the store, and not earned like the Victorious skins. \n\nYes, they were things available for purchase of a yesteryear that people have screamed about wanting. The only difference I can see (which I probably don't have the whole picture) between the two is that these skins could be earned instead of purchased.\nIs there just not an incentive on riot to do this to make they community happy if you guys don't stand to make money off of it? \n\nIf you need a reward to give the Ranked Players from yesteryear that is comparable to what you gave the Legacy Skin Owners, I think I saw something about Ranked Decay coming back. Maybe give them 1 month of protection from Decay from Inactivity per skin? As a toggle option (kind of like turning off EXP gain in WoW) to where you have to actively enable it. \n\n> This could be an awesome solution to events skin in the future - especially for something like Worlds. \n> \n> As for the existing PAX skins, we don't have plans to bring them back, so this solution wouldn't necessarily work for events that occurred several years ago. \n\n\nNot planning to bring them back? Any reason why exactly?\nI could understand if you were going the Konami route with their YGO cards and controlling the secondary market because that would undercut your bottom line, but the earlier idea for End of Season skins could be applied here too with the E-Ticket for future events to allow choice, with the only people who have bad feelings are the special snowflakes.\n\nReward solution if you want to go the legacy skins route: Maybe a free E-Ticket per pre-existing skin on the account? It allows them to maintain content for a few years for the previous support and giving a nod to those players. \n \n> While the idea of having some kind of reward for being a part of the PBE isn't bad, it falls back into the elitist comment you made earlier regarding Victorious skins.

We've made it clear to players that skin codes are disabled shortly after distribution, which has also lessened the amount of players getting scammed due to false promises of rare skin codes. \n\nWe did something similar to your idea with having unique codes as Worlds last year. A unique code was given with each ticket, which could then be redeemed for Championship skins. \n\nWe don't want to be police officers when it comes to the distribution of skins - they're meant to be a fun way to interact, as well as a way for players to express themselves in game. \n\n> If you went to PAX you went to PAX (theoretically) for more than just the PAX TF skin and it was an added bonus.

We can easily refund x amount for a skin because we know how much someone paid for it. For content that has never been in the store, it becomes a bit different. \n\nLet's take Black Alistar - Do we charge for the price of the pre-order? Do we charge what it'd be worth today in terms of price tier? Is it worth more than that? Is it worth ~$20 like you've suggested? \n\n> However by not allowing opportunities you (riot) are showing that seniority is the rule here.

There are various games who offer limited content based on when you started playing. Do you feel similarly? How does that content compare to skins? Are you more attached to an unobtainable skin versus an unobtainable icon, for example? \n\n> If that's the case, wouldn't the same be held true of every Snowdown/Harrowing season? \n\nThese were purchased (which means that at one point or another, available in the store) not earned, so it's not the same case.

You can still have something that is only available to higher ranks, to show that you worked hard during this season.

We're certainly aiming to be player focused, which means opening up dialogue regarding touchy topics (Lyte discussing chat restrictions, etc), or something a bit more small scale like Legacy/Limited skins. \n\nWhile I may not have all the answers, I think dialogue is the first step that needs to happen. \n\n> I try, this is how we keep healthy discussions with Red Posters going.\nIt ensures that we, the community, can talk with you on things we feel passionate about and we don't scare you off.\n\nAbsolutely! \n\nI'm always up for a discussion as long as it stays healthy.

I understand Riots stance is \"No,  never again! Can't hear you blah blah blah,\" But to have gotten the Silver Kayle skin etc, you needed to be in the right place at the right time.
