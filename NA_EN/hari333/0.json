I double checked your account and it looks like you did have some of the missions completed like Merciless Shadow on the 29th and One Blade, One Purpose on the 28th. It looks like you were getting all the missions correctly, but you haven't gotten any missions today since the event is over. \n\nMissions should be coming back later on, but I don't have any dates for that quite yet.","replies":[{"poster":"hari333","date":"2017-07-01T15:26:25.499+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"so i need to use my tokens , because they will expire ?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-01T22:09:25.444+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The tokens will expire on July 24th, but you can still convert them into blue essence until then.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
