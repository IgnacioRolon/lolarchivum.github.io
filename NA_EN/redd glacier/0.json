The spikes generally send me between 200-1999 MS.  Which for me is relatively new,  I don't think I've ever been so frustrated playing LoL  I've lost 3 ranked games in a row over it.  \r\n\r\nAssuming it would get better, it seems to be only getting worse.   \r\n\r\nI've restarted the client, I've checked my Task Manager to see if I had any processes or background downloads going, nothing at all. I've flushed my IP and that didn't seem to help as I jumped into an ARAM game, that went horribly, one of our players hadn't connected, one disconnected halfway through, and I was still getting major MS spikes. I tried using the speed tester\r\n\r\nI then tried opening my browser while I was experiencing a spike in latency, running videos on youtube at 1080p, they're loading and buffering fine with smooth playback.  So what the heck?\r\nHas anyone been having issues with in-game (after starting a match) connectivity?  I don't really want to re-install the client. Also, it was running perfectly fine yesterday and I was climbing steadily. \r\n\r\n{{champion:238}} {{item:3070}} {{summoner:3}}","replies":[{"poster":"Son of Ornn","date":"2017-11-16T02:00:18.319+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since there's obviously no issue connecting with other sites like Youtube, something might be interfering with LoL's connection specifically.\n\nLet's start with a Traceroute to see what might be getting in the way!
