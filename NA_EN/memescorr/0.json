Now I am in a 10 Minute low priority queue and I just wanna know if it stays there temporarily or is it permanent? I haven't played League of Legends in 3 months waiting for it to go away but now its 20 minutes to wait until another game. I dont understand why it increased 10 more minutes cause I haven't got on it in 3 months, I need help because I'm tired of waiting and sometimes I disconnect so I have to wait another 20 minutes.{{champion:32}}","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-23T21:21:27.782+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"[Leaverbuster](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ) will only apply on an account after multiple leaves and not just one.  Completing the required amount of games in lower priority queue will improve your status with the system.  If you take a 3 month break, your standing will remain the same as the system is based on games played and not time.\n\nIt's important to consistently stay in games to prevent negative experiences for others or escalated lower priority queues.  If you have any feedback on how the system works, feel free to share it with the community in the[ player behavior](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation) boards.  Otherwise, let me know if you have any technical issues preventing you from staying connected.  I'm happy to help if i can!","replies":[]}]}
