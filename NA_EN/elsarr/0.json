I also am level 1 on the Boards but several times that on the game, are these two separate things? Is this account not linked to the game account? Do I even exist?\r\n\r\nAnyway, I just got started with LoL and I thought I'd participate in the boards and with the community, unfortunately I haven't been able to do so as I can't reply to anyone nor can I up vote posts. The only thing I could do is seemingly post this, I don't know if it'll even get posted. I tried to lookup how to increase board level, can't find anything.\r\n\r\n*Hits post and waits*","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-13T04:49:45.325+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, they aren't. However, because they're tied together, if you hadn't used the boards for a while, your levels may fall out of sync. A discussion post like this here in H&S forces a manual sync and updates your level. It looks like your level has updated to 8, so you should be good to go now! ^.^","replies":[{"poster":"ElsaRR","date":"2017-01-14T18:17:30.411+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for clearing that up :)","replies":[]}]}]}
