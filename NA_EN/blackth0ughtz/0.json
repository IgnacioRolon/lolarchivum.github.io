This still keeps Kalista's insane amount of mobility and utility with a real weakness in a lack of range.\n\nAlso, keep in mind that Kalista doesn't need a target to use her mobility in some degree because she can dash after using her Q.\n\nIn regard to the current strong ADC's keep in mind that this a Kalista thread.

Now we can actually talk like human beings.\n\nKalista has a LOT less burst than Lucian.  Lucian's passive and Q result in much higher damage output when compared to Kalista's Rend, which will tend to stack up enough to equal a single Luc Q.  Luc can then keep using his passive and easily surpass Kalista in damage.  As for the utility argument, Utility and mobility mean nothing when you struggle to deliver damage.  You'll notice how often you're comparing Kalista to champions who are traditionally thought of as the weaker part of the ADC crowd.  I'm not averse to seeing any of those champs buffed (especially Ashe), but I don't think they should be the bar set on strength.\n\nAnd if you don't thing these changes are a gutting, look at what losing 50 range did to Lucian.  Much of his kit is quite similar to how he was on release due to Riot removing many of the buffs he got.  When was the last time you saw a really powerful Lucian?  When (outside of his free week) was the last time you saw a Lucian at all?  That change was HALF of what you're proposing for Kalista.  You should be able to reason it out from there why I referred to it as gutting her.  Range nerfs, especially on ADCs tend to have enormous consequences, which is why Riot figured the only way to reduce Lucian's then HUGELY dominant power was to nerf his range.  Kalista shows none of that overbearing strength, so why hit her harder than Lucian?\n\nHer Q dash is, like the rest of her dashes, very short ranged.  It's a short enough dash that it's actually pretty difficult to get over any walls with it (short of J4's Cataclysm), which is something most other mobile ADCs do with ease.\n\nAnd finally, why I brought up the comparison argument.  The reason I mentioned the other ADCs wasn't to change the thread topic, but to show that Kalista's not alone on her level.  Traditionally, the forums call anything they don't like \"OP\", but in this case it seems to be just an argument of \"I don't like this, remove it.\"  She's mobile, sure.  But she sacrifices natural steroids for her mobility and has a good portion of her power gated by cooperation with her support.  She's one among equals and I don't think she needs to be nerfed just because she's unique among her peers.","replies":[{"poster":"Jungle Lux God","date":"2015-02-08T19:14:31.648+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Utility means that you don't need to deal damage to be useful. Kalista may get stomped by a Lucian in lane, but she's still just as useful as him when she's down two items because of the power she has in the utility she has. Also, keep in mind that Lucian was the best ADC in the game when he lost his 50 range, and needed several patches of nerfs to balance him out.\n\nLikewise, her dashes are spammable. It doesn't matter that they are short in that sense, because Kaista can use them for an indefinite amount of time. At 500-550 range, you cannot deal with her with a large majority of champs due to both range and mobility discrepancies, while closer to 400-475 range, you can fight her with a larger majority of champs without Kalista feeling useless.","replies":[{"poster":"Adrian Umbra","date":"2015-02-08T20:02:41.444+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Utility means you have use outside damage.  Doesn't mean that you're going to be able to make up a two item lead with you ghosts and your ult.  She's not Ashe.  She doesn't have a permaslow.  She doesn't have a long range stun.  Her usefulness is still dependent on her damage and her ability to get that damage down.  You don't see Ashe's laning phase being destroyed purely based on the fact that she has utility, do you?  Then why do it to Kalista?\n\nAs far as Lucian, you noticed they gave him a bunch of compensation buffs when he lost the 50 range, didn't you?  Most of which were taken away which led to his current state?  If you're wondering, I can link you to a page with the exact changes made during that era.  Most of them were buffs to make up for the range nerf.\n\nAnd yes, her dashes are spammable.  Dependent on her attack speed.  Before she grabs a Hurricane or BotRK, she's probably on par with the likes of Lucian, Graves, and Ezrael without the ability damage to make up for it.  Unlike most of the League, her mobility is dependent on her itemization and thus she suffers as is in lane because of it.  If Udyr ganks her in that time, he'll catch her.  If Lee ganks her in that time, he'll catch her.  If J4 ganks in that time, he'll catch her.  It's a point of weakness that most of the forum seems to be forgetting about.\n\nAnd for not being able to fight her at that range, what makes you think that she'll be more managable at 400-475 range than 500-550?  550 is already within most point-and-click spell ranges and she'll be just as mobile and able to dodge skillshots at 400.  All you'll do is make her laning phase hell as she's unable to catch the opposing Caitlyn, Jinx, or Corki and unable to deal meaningful damage when she does, meaning she'll fall behind and be unable to do anything.\n\nIn fact, compare Kalista to Caitlyn for a second, think of the number of champs who can catch Caitlyn, and compare your list there to that of Kalista.  Which champs can Kalista kite that Cait can't?\n\nFor that matter, why is Kalista in particular so OP?  All I'm hearing is her advertised strengths, with her weaknesses conveniently left out and comparisons to champions considered weak.

Not to mention all the comparisons people are making are to weaker champs that Kalista crowds out because they fill similar roles that Kalista does better, not because we want Kalista to be nerfed to the bottom of all the ADC's in the game.

Her main strength is pincushioning  jungle objectives and dealing obscene damage to them. She has trouble dueling other adc's or fighting casters. Her main weakness is snares too bad no one plays Ryze or Mao or Zyra that much anymore.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JustMyBassCannon","date":"2015-02-07T22:14:37.097+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":6,"body":"*If* Martial Poise is a balance problem, it could be fixed with an internal cooldown. Short, but longer than the less-than-1-second 'cooldown' of basic attacks.
