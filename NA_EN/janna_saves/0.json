Some champs have abilities that you send out and recast and these count as two stacks for tear. Lissandra&#039;s E will stack when cast and stack when she teleports to her target location for example, or Janna&#039;s whirlwind Q will as well. Lux has a bug where he E will stack when cast but wont stack when it is popped.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Exgeniar","date":"2016-07-27T00:30:39.368+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":0,"body":"imo.
