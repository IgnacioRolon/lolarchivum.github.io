How he treats towards others in SoloQ isn&#039;t okay... He&#039;s being toxic again, spam pinging players when they make mistakes and insulting them. He has such a pompous and obnoxious attitude while he streams too and he&#039;s so condescending, he acts like he&#039;s superior to everyone else. Apdo is arrogant too, but it&#039;s acceptable because he isn&#039;t being so in the same manner as Tyler1.\n\nI think the fame and how high he&#039;s climbing is getting to him. I liked the reformed version of Tyler, not this one. I hope he reverts back to how he usually was soon.","replies":[]}
