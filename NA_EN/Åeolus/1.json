Besides the tank build, the only difference from a standard Ahri build that he uses is Rylais and Archangel. Doesn't differ too much from regular mid lane builds. Building Archangels is pretty interesting though, and I have experimented with it. It really only works in certain matchups but it's generally harmful to Ahri as it doesn't allow her to excel in the mid game where she's most good at. There are some other items that could work such as hextech glp, protobelt, and liandry's. I feel like his builds could improve tbh.","replies":[{"poster":"Kukan Seishin","date":"2017-03-18T04:01:15.811+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sry :/ Best I can do with my lack of sleep right now, maybe in the morning?","replies":[{"poster":"Åeolus","date":"2017-03-18T04:08:51.274+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's fine.

He couldn't discern that Protobelt was a viable item at the time, so I don't think he'd be able to know if there isn't another good Ahri Top lane build that exists.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-03-18T02:08:22.799+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"This will not work in almost every matchup.\n\nHonestly, ADC triforce>pd>ie (as weird as it sounds) works way better than top (and it is viable at just about any MMR, top you will just get shut down by any fighter or tank and be useless).","replies":[{"poster":"Åeolus","date":"2017-03-18T02:10:25.530+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So you're saying that Ahri Top should follow an adc build?
