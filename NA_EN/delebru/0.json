toplane roster atm,  especially in higher divisions (Gold+),  simply because he lacks mechanical depth.\r\nI understand that Garen is supposed to be a beginners champ but there can still be mechanical depth without the champ being too complicated.\r\nA champ should be playable in all divisions and just buffing stats would make him op in lower divisions.\r\nSo some extra kind of extra mechanic on him seems like the only solution. \r\n\r\nI&acute;ve thought about two possibilitys:\r\n\r\n1. give his Q extra damage when his passive is up\r\n2. his passive not being able to get canceled while W is active","replies":[{"poster":"Critmaster Garen","date":"2016-08-24T19:44:16.156+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"garen can be buffed to being viable in plat upwads without being op in lower divisions.\n\nsince his rework, there was almost no difference in winrate between plat and silver/bronze. it was a 2% difference at best. even now that hes suffering at plat, hes actually not even strong in bronze and silver anymore.\n\ni dont think making his q deal more damage with his passive activated will make him stronger at high ranked play. that sounds like a change that makes him rather stronger in the lower divisions where his opponents dont remember to poke his passive down.\n\nthere are a couple of options to buff garen.\n\n- buff his lategame spin damage. he feels like he deals nowhere near enough damage to be relevant when fighting anyone but the villain lategame. certain adc will just facetank him in melee with lifesteal. his highest winrate build right now includes an infinity edge, because its the only way to compensate for lacking damage.\n\n- revert the nerfs to his mobility by increasing his base ms by 5 and his q ms by 5%. the removal of boot enchants and swifites nerfs hurt his ability to make plays.\n\n- buff his lategame defense to compensate for the repeated nerfs of his defensive itemization.\n\n\nany of these should work.","replies":[{"poster":"Delebru","date":"2016-08-24T22:34:43.059+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"i would totally agree with those changes although i believe his problem is more about

his items over the course of the season.\n\nthe mage update alone removed a large part of mobility from everyone, by deleting boot enchants. a lot of slower melee champions dropped in winrate with that patch.\n\nthey just removed boot enchants without really dealing with the fallout it caused. champions who dropped in winrate as a result never got compensated.\n\nspirit visage lost 15 mr on that patch aswell.\n\neverything that happened, from the health and damage nerf to cleaver (even if it was made cheaper), to the resistance nerf on spirit visage, the health nerfs on dead mans, steraks, warmogs, the cost increase on sunfire, the cost increase and ms nerfs on swifties, the removal of veteran scars % health scaling.\n\neverything together hit his lategame effectiveness. it stacks up to a significant nerf. when almost every single item he buys gets hit in some way, then its no suprise hes falling off so hard. he has a weaker early game than pre rework without really getting a decent lategame out of it.\n","replies":[{"poster":"Matezoide","date":"2016-08-24T20:36:30.903+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah, alright.\n\n I knew that the itemization changes

What is this, pong?\n\nGive him a resource bar and passive: Moral. \nMoral increases or decreases based on actions within a distance around garen, and applies some buffs to himself and allies. This would replace his rather one-dimensional passive (rewarding you for not doing anything?..)\nThis would be more thematically suitable.\n\nSwitch his silly spin for something along the lines of a built-in titanic hydra passive, with an active that increases attack speed for the next few attacks.\n\nChange his ult, which like the old poppy, contains way too much of his power budget and makes balancing the rest of his kit dificult.\nHis ult could, for example, give all nearby allies a movement speed boost and 60% tenacity, with duration based on his moral bar. Sort of an aoe mini-ragnarok.\nSince garen has a long history of bravely running away, making it only work while moving towards enemies is not at all needed.","replies":[{"poster":"TyrekGoldenspear","date":"2016-09-23T08:17:23.178+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"....\n\nI stopped reading when you dared to replace the Spin2Win.\nThat is his signature move good sir.","replies":[]}]}]}
