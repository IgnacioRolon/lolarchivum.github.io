You get really good with that champ,learn matchups,mechanics,macro,you win most of the games but you also play other champions really bad. If you main Irelia and get autofill supp you will probably lose or if Irelia gets banned. So yea it is good to have 2-3 champs which I considered to do.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"PhearBunny","date":"2018-12-15T01:33:32.449+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"have a few \"one tricks\" under your belt.\nIdeally have atleast one that is actually impactful.\n\nI OTP\nLeona-Jungle>Support.\nNocturne-Top>Jungle.\nTrundle-Support(Retired, no longer viable)\nPantheon-Mid.\n\nI like to OTP off meta things, I can maintain a 55% wr at Plat level with any of them, but the noticeable problem is that they are low-impact champions, and regardless of how well I do, I don't have much say in the outcome of matches.
