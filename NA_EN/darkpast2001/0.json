I don&#039;t know why I&#039;m surprised I got banned because even stating your opinion anywhere, you will be verbally abused. My teammate was purposefully dying to the enemy team, a fizz mind you, and wouldn&#039;t stop. This was about the third time I was paired up with this guy and the same results happened over and over again. \r\n\r\nI told him to try to stop dying, it shouldn&#039;t be hard he&#039;s playing fizz lol, and to maybe just wait till the farm goes under his turret. He doesn&#039;t agree, and starts to argue with me for no reason whatsoever. I start intentionally feeding the enemy team at this point, saying how it&#039;s unbelievable how toxic a player could be while still being able to get cs. By the end of the game, we had the same score, more or less, which was very interesting to me. \r\n\r\nI am just disappointed in Riot. I love this game so much, and honestly it&#039;s a shame how a possible pre-made team can all just report one guy and that person get punished for nothing. \r\n\r\nThanks for reading my story.","replies":[{"poster":"scazzman","date":"2016-10-19T04:47:53.062+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"but you intentionally fed","replies":[]},{"poster":"Troll Armada","date":"2016-10-19T09:56:49.158+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> \"My teammate was purposefully dying to the enemy team\"\n\nyou say this like it's some rare occurrence. this is like 90% of my games. \n\n>\"and starts to argue with me for no reason whatsoever.\"\n\n\nreally? no reason?\n\n> I start intentionally feeding the enemy team at this point, \n\nBingo.  Next time don't rage and don't feed. Offer constructive advice not pointless bitchery like \"this should be eeezy, it's fizz\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sarutobi","date":"2016-10-19T09:29:57.006+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You weren't an for standing up for your beliefs you got ban for breaking the rules! Although it's really hard to say since you won't post your chatlogs!

You may have both had bad scores but yours were intentional, therefore your actions were punishable.\n\nIf he was doing something you feel is punishable, you report, mute him, and move on. It isn't your job to try to pay him back, all you are doing is making it worse.","replies":[{"poster":"Desolas Arterius","date":"2016-10-19T15:36:13.935+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not only are you correct, but to receive a 14 day suspension also means he either received previous punishments prior to this, or that his behavior was so severe it warranted a skip in tiers. \n\nVery well put though :) Saved me the effort of having to type that up haha.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Prandine","date":"2016-10-19T16:30:07.964+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">I start intentionally feeding the enemy team at this point\n\nAnd this my good sir is why you got banned, because you decided to ruin the game for everyone else involved. If someone is being a jerk then just mute, report and move on. If you retaliate then the both of you will be punished, it's really that simple.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CooL Ice Tea","date":"2016-10-19T05:40:08.365+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> I start intentionally feeding the enemy team at this point\n\n> I am just disappointed in Riot\n\nSo is your mama ... grow up and stop that behaviour!","replies":[]}]}
