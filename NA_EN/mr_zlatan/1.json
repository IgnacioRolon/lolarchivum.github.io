{"poster":"Mr Zlatan","date":"2017-04-03T03:41:58.758+0000","title":"Disconnecting frequently during games","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The last two games I have played I have disconnected 3 times in both of them, and I know it's not a wifi problem because my discord works throughout the whole time and there has been no ping higher than 100 in those games, yet this is the first time this has happened to me in this way. The way it disconnects is that I'm in a game and all of a sudden I get alt tabbed out of it and back to the client where the reconnect button is on it. I highly doubt that it has something to do with my keyboard either because the last time it happened I wasn't even touching my keyboard or mouse. The one thing I think it might have been was, 2 days ago I had to restart my pc because of an update and the only 2 games I've played were the 2 that I was dc'ing.\r\nAny suggestions are appreciated, thanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-03T03:57:28.286+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since the game is minimizing and you can see the client with the reconnect button, it definitely sounds like your network is having a hard time keeping a stable connection with our servers. The last windows update you had may have adjusted some of your network settings, so let's be sure to check there first.\n\nCheck out this [**Connection Guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) for some steps we can take to troubleshoot.
