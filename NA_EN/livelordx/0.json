A lot of steps need to be taken on the back-end in order to make sure that League of Legends loads normally.  Primarily, there are two root causes for this issue:\n\n1)  Hardware issues -- Your computer cannot load the game files.\n\n2) Connection issue -- Your computer cannot establish a stable connection with our Game Server.\n\nSince there is little to no overlap between these two, it can sometimes be a shot in the dark in terms of troubleshooting.  In an effort to start, make sure to respond back and attach your dxdiag and your R3d Log so I can take a deeper look!\n\n1) Dxdiag information: https://support.leagueoflegends.com/entries/27495980-Network-System-and-League-of-Legends-Logs#wq5\n\n2) Your most recent r3d log where you experienced the problem (You'll notice that the file name starts with the date/time and ends with r3dlog.txt): https://support.leagueoflegends.com/entries/27495980-Network-System-and-League-of-Legends-Logs#wq7","replies":[{"poster":"Livelordx","date":"2014-10-30T18:26:48.814+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd like a response please.","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2014-10-31T05:42:19.314+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey LiveLordX!\n\nSorry for the delay in response!\n\nI took a look at your logs, and it appears that your computer is fairly up to date.  In addition, your R3d Log shows that your computer is successfully scanned, but it looks like it fails to properly connect and initialize a connection with our Game Server.  It is hard to say definitely right now, and the best way to confirm this is by reviewing some Network Logs.  Unfortunately, Network Logs contain sensitive information and I do not want you putting this information in the forums. \n\nTherefore, make sure to [submit a new ticket](https://support.leagueoflegends.com/anonymous_requests/new) to our Tech Team and include the following information so that we can investigate a bit further and find the root cause as to what is going on:\n\n1) Network Analysis: https://support.leagueoflegends.com/entries/27495980-Network-System-and-League-of-Legends-Logs#wq1\n\n2) NetworkInfo Log: https://support.leagueoflegends.com/entries/27495980-Network-System-and-League-of-Legends-Logs#wq4\n\n3) Process List: https://support.leagueoflegends.com/entries/27495980-Network-System-and-League-of-Legends-Logs#wq3","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Livelordx","date":"2014-10-29T17:08:28.383+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why can I not load the game all of a sudden?
