He usually is on. So the next day i looked and he was gone. So tried to refriend him again and it said if the user accepts you will see him online. And the moment i sent it his name popped up again. But after i closed the browser his name dissapeared again. I refriended him a couple of times and it kept happening. Please help. I really like to talk to him again. He really was a good friend. (His username was Dayst and his club was Woord.)","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-03T23:58:49.614+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This may be caused by a corrupted summoner properties file.
