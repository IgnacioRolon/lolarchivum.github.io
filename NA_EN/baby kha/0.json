Yesterday, I was doing just that and 6 times, that message popped up saying to restart. And I did, thinking it would fix itself, which it did not do. So I re-downloaded league yesterday night and proceeded to update the client and then close it once if had finished. So opened up league an hour ago, left it open just like I did yesterday and then checked on it. Which upon doing that I see the message that said \"There seems to be a problem with patching league of Legends. We'll restore a backup version and try updating it again after you restart the patcher.\" (Link to the message that popped is above). So if you could please tell me why this is happening that would be great, also I reported a bug about constantly reconnecting to any game I try to play, including custom. Which I know you are working on. Maybe this helps solve it or complicate it, I don't know. If you are able to figure out why this message pops, great. Hope everything gets solved.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-29T22:13:23.168+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like a lot of the issues you're experiencing are caused by a *poor or unstable connection* to our servers.
