I press rejoin game like usual and go back into the load menu for it to bugplat again. Now this was unusual because I never have 2 crashes in a row. I try rejoining about 5 times until I finally decide to just restart my client. I close my client, and double click League of Legends to open the client, and then I get a bugsplat error before the actual client even opened. A couple tries later I finally get into the launch menu, but I get a message that reads \"POSSIBLE DATA CORRUPTION DETECTED.\" As soon as I see this I start to freak out because I hate patching my client because it takes forever. I press quit to see if I can just run the game without having to patch, but as soon as I click Play, the client dissapears and nothing comes up. I also try this a couple times to see if I can get it to start up, but it didn't work. I end up patching it (which will take a couple hours) and I go and watch a movie upstairs. By the time the movie was over I go back downstairs to see how the patcher was doing and it was suprisingly finished. I finally get to play a game! I automaticly start a game of norms (blind yet again) and I get into the loading menu, but I get a bugsplat error, I try to rejoin a couple of times but it keeps crashing, so I restart client. The exact same thing happens and it is giving me to option to patch the client. I don't want to patch the client again only for it to mess up again, so if anyone could get me, that would be great.\r\n\r\nTL;DR\r\nMy game keeps crashing. Afer patching, still keeps crashing.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-26T22:51:18.019+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It seems like you have a combination of issues here that will need to be resolved one at a time.  To start, if your patcher isn't loading then it may not have permission to scan game files or launch.  If that's the case, then it may also not have patched properly.  Go over the [permissions](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) guide to restore that access.\n\nOnce that's resolved, it should work towards repairing game files as well.  You can also download our [hextech repair tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367) to help with the process!  Hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
