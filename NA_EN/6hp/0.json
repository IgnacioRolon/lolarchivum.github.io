My only choice was to re-install it. but now the patch's are way too big and take too much space for my PC too handle. I wish there was some way I could play on my Google chrome computer, but LoL doesent work on Google Chrome. Is there another way too play LoL? :(","replies":[{"poster":"RiotBok","date":"2016-05-25T00:27:56.828+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you're consistently getting stuck at 33%, this usually means that there's a connection error that's preventing you from connecting (or you're disconnecting) from the patching servers.  Around 33% is when the patcher is actually attempting to download new content vs. scanning files.  I'd recommend checking out our [Connection Troubleshooting](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) article and see if that helps alleviate your patching problems.  Let me know if it helps!","replies":[]}]}
