The official post states the following:\n\n>Every League of Legends player who has played a game within the last couple of months will receive a new summoner icon along with the Riot Kayle skin. If you don’t own Kayle, you’ll get her, too. If you already own both, you’ll receive a mystery gift. Players who can’t receive mystery gifts will instead receive the RP value of a mystery gift in their region.\n\nYou can find the rest of the announcement [here.](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/riot-games/announcements/thank-you) Let me know if you have any questions.","replies":[{"poster":"Knopfdruck","date":"2016-09-13T20:32:44.744+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello!
