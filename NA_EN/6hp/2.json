I have Windows on a Lenovo cpu, and there is the main app that comes with the original software called \"Energy Manager.\" Somehow, my setting got changed to 'green mode' (to save power or something stupid like that) - anyways, I switched it to 'high performance mode': Holy Smokes!!! Even the champ select screen moves lightning quick, compared to the laggy, choppy switching of the back and forth ban & pick. Whereas before, I had to keep all settings at low quality/high performace, and still barely got to +25 FPS; now I'm running at all high quality and can manage to clock an average of 80-90+ FPS, sometimes as high as 130-150 FPS I've seen at times. \n\nCheck this simple setting out first. Saved me a lot of grief :D \n\n~Spence \"SuSpence\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-13T22:36:35.690+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Low FPS can be caused by a number of different factors, though the most common causes are problematic drivers or windows power settings.
