Between putting champions on the back burner, over nerfing champions, preserving those they they in particular find \"healthy\", giving us the \"Guys we know best trust us. Oh woops damn we messed up!\" again and again, and finally never even paying attention to feedback on the PBE. Seriously do you just use that thing to showcase changes to champions and not for the intended use of listening to feedback? Because I honestly cannot remember a time where feedback was given EVEN FOR GLITCHES, that you actually listened to.\n\nYour \"balancing team\" (which I question if it is even really there a lot of times), needs some serious attention. Whether you realize it or not your player base gets attached to certain champions and would like for them to receive adequate work into making that champion a good champion for league, and you don't deliver time and time again. The funny thing is their attachment is what makes you money, because those are the people buying your skins, just for you to more or less shit on their champion if you decide it isn't best for the game. How nice. How many champions got nerfed and then placed on hold? Elise, Syndra, Ryze, Gragas, Zac, Evelynn, Shyvanna, Zilean, and I'm sure there are more. And then we have problems that have been in existance forever than you also continue to fail to achieve. Akali is all point and click, so you reduce her range... how does that solve the problem again? Lee Sin's kit has too much in it, but you don't change it.\n\nYou overnerf and make drastic changes over and over again, instead of slowly chipping away at problem champions and bringing things into balance at a good pace. Game design should be treated as artwork, and in art you don't make giant pencil strokes and glob paint all over the easel. No, you take things slowly and pay attention to details, something your balance \"team\" hasn't quite gotten yet.","replies":[{"poster":"Alorasence","date":"2015-02-20T23:18:55.597+0000","up_votes":32,"down_votes":8,"body":"Balance is why I quit WOW, and will probably be why I quit this game too.\n\nI miss Syndra. \n\nI'm sick of rotating around my champions. \n\nI used to just play champions through the thick and thin...when they were buffed and nerfed and when they were meta and nonmeta.

It all happened when back at late S3 I fell in love with her and  bought her Aether Wing Kayle and started playing her alot. Then S4 came around and she became meta then nerf after nerf after nerf. Now as a laner she's so damn hard to play early on since she needs 2 items at least to get rolling. However, I still find some success with her in the jungle. But again atm she's very items reliant which means if u fall behind u really can't do much except ulting ur ADC/APC and healing aka support Kayle :C","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"B1naryB0t","date":"2015-02-21T17:03:29.863+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Azir main here.

I don't care about irrelevant statistics like how often they win or lose. That has nothing to do with champion design unless its a huge high or a huge low. Winrates really just shows how balanced or imbalanced a champion probably could be numerically. \n\nI assumed by an earlier post of yours that anything under 50 was bad.\n\nAnyway, {{champion:421}} is a good champion and {{champion:106}} is not. The former is flexible yet not too felixble and has clear weaknesses in play pattern and in her kit while also having clear strengths. Fighting as her is just as complex as fighting her. Volibear however does not do any of those things. He just runs forward and is mostly mindless and fighting him is just a game of \"run away and hope he doesn't kill me\" which feels redundant since the majority of melee champions are like that inherently.
