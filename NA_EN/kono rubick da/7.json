He has plenty of damage, but lacks extended team fight presence and survive-ability. I'm not talking hyper-mobility, he can't play like zed or katarina, but maybe make him more like kha zix or diana, more mobility but a little bit of damage mitigation or even move speed would be good. Maybe try to find a way to reward a talon player for entering the fight and staying a little longer instead of just blowing 1 person up and getting the hell out of there.
