Also keep in mind that champion.gg uses Riot's API, meaning if anything it's Riot's own fault for the numbers being wonky (not that it's anyone's fault).\n\nBesides, weird stuff like that doesn't really invalidate the other numbers, especially not average winrates. It's not like they just make up the average winrate. Average winrate is just that, a ratio of wins/losses across the entire sample. People of all number of games and ranks above Gold are taken into account, making average winrate a pretty telling number when it comes to a champion's viability. Fiddlesticks being at 50% puts him just above the median for jungle and means at least 50% of the games he's in are wins. Still only pretty average, but more than viable.

This is why sometimes even when a champion is at a 50% average they'll still be OP because in some cases it means they are winning 60% of the time with experienced players. This is why Azir was nerfed despite his low average win rate, since his win rate was 58% with good players.","replies":[]},{"poster":"yay nibbers","date":"2015-11-19T00:00:01.769+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"While I don't think avg. winrate alone is enough to determine a champion's balance, it's definitely a good place to start. Of course, a flat 50% strictly speaking would mean a champion is balanced, but you can go higher than that and still have a well balanced champion. _**To me**_, between 45% and 55%, avg. winrate is more a measure of how well off the champion is doing at a given moment, and anything higher or lower than that can mean the champion is under or overtuned. I think it's also important to look at how a champion's winrate changes with player experience. You can have a champion with a lowish, say, 48% winrate, but then have it spike up to 50% or even higher on a player with some games under their belt. Because avg. winrate takes all games on a particular champion into account, inexperienced players can bring the average down. It all depends on circumstances and other such factors.\n\nTo put it shortly, 49/50%-55% is a pretty ideal range, in my opinion.\n\nThe Swain anomaly OP pointed out was in reference to Swain's winrate by player experience, not patch. If you look at different champions on champion.gg, you'll find some (usually older, less played, or harder) champions have a weird thing where their winrate by player experience will dip as games played goes up, which contradicts common sense (more games = more experience = more skill). It's a weird occurrence that I can only imagine is explainable by how little these champions are usually played. When taking averages, low sample size means even a small amount of extreme numbers can skew the average one way or the other. In the case of a hard champion, a person's winrate for the first few games will likely be lower as they learn the champion, going back up as they get better. This is likely what we're seeing with Swain.\n\nKeep in mind this is all conjecture, I'm no expert on any of this.","replies":[{"poster":"Autrah Fang","date":"2015-11-19T01:10:10.005+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"although your response was conjecture, it is still very informative. thank you very much for the explanations! :)","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"48983507DEL1","date":"2015-11-20T03:32:14.693+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agreed, most Rengar mains do the same thing: buy up to Tier 2 then rush items that are better on him like Tiamat and Ghostblade. \n\nAlso, the Fear change was to give him more consistency, but it also made it better for peeling.","replies":[{"poster":"yay nibbers","date":"2015-11-20T03:59:12.420+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, Warrior isnt really good anymore now that it doesn't  give arm. pen.\n\nAnd yeah I understand  the fear change, I'm just saying it was funnier when they ran around randomly in a panic.","replies":[{"poster":"48983507DEL1","date":"2015-11-20T04:31:04.450+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh he did that even before the removal of armor pen just because of the movement speed bonus and critical strike stat. \n\nThe build was Tiamat, Brutilizer, Lucidity Boots, Tiamat, Youmuu's, Last Whisperer, IE, Rav Hydra, Phantom Dancer x2 (sell boots).

You might wonder why I factor in movespeed in the below comparison, but it's fairly important for keeping up with people, dodging stuff and kiting (insofar as fiddle can kite)\nHealth \t524 – 1884\nArmor \t20.9 – 80.4\nMagic res. \t30.0\nMov. speed \t335 \n(drain)\nCompared to other champions usually considered squishy:\n\nYasuo:\nHealth \t518 – 1912\nArmor \t24.7 – 82.5\nMagic res. \t30.0\nMov. speed \t345 \n(Shield100 – 510, not to mention windwall/dashes. Yes, I am aware he's melee.)\n\nKarthus\nHealth   516 – 1791\nArmor    20.9 – 80.4\nMagic res. \t30.0\nMov. speed \t335 \n(passive means he doesn't have to be _as_ tanky)\nHe's only slightly tankier than Karthus (8-93 hp), and not nearly as tanky as yasuo (6 more base hp at lvl 1, but less hp/level and no shield. Less mobile and can't protect himself from cc. Though fidd gets a + for being mid-ranged)\nEven if you build him as an ap bruiser, he'll still die easily. But more importantly you'll do less damage per second (more time for people to get out of your range because you're slow), you _still_ get absolutely destroyed by any random cc and your cooldowns are too long to use more then once, maybe twice with cdr, if you're not being ignored. Altough it could probably work if you have a solid cc team, I used to like playing him with an Orianna, Morgana, Malphite or Galio mid, Malphite or another aoe cc tank top and preferably thresh or leona bot*\n\n*The numbers are current, but the experience I'm talking from is from season 3+4, and only minor experience in season 5 before magus removal.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Xietnin","date":"2015-11-18T22:13:17.343+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"RIP Fiddlesticks (and Cassiopeia), who led me to place in Gold III one season.\n{{champion:9}} Sleep softly.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zaghyr","date":"2015-11-18T17:16:30.413+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"> -way too much mana cost, WHO ON EARTH has 120 mana cost on 2 spells except veigar who has a {{item:3028}}  passive?\n\n{{champion:40}} *Cries","replies":[{"poster":"KONO RUBICK DA","date":"2015-11-18T17:23:05.262+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Zaghyr,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=lNJx15K1,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2015-11-18T17:16:30.413+0000)\n>\n> {{champion:40}} *Cries\n\ndidn't know that she had a high mana cost, but if she had a low mana cost, she would have wave cleared every time in the middle lane","replies":[{"poster":"Zaghyr","date":"2015-11-20T15:20:45.545+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ya, but since they nerfed her q, you will need a lot of ap to make up for the base damage being crap, even when fully charged","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"ltmetal","date":"2015-11-18T20:03:01.224+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"If you ask me, no champion is more deserving of a buff/gameplay update.
