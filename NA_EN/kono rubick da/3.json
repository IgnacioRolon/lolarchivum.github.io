Poppy getting picked occasionally doesn't worry us. Poppy as regularly played though, pick/ban especially, would be a problem. Because of that we've got a Poppy rework in progress, with one of the aims of that project being to make it so if Poppy's strong enough to get regular play that's fine, rather than something we feel compelled to deal with.","replies":[{"poster":"Retillin","date":"2015-07-25T21:54:58.597+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Are you happy with the thought of Poppy being changed into a yordle tank as opposed to a bursty champion?

If you check out her guides on solomid or lolking, a lot of them might have options to build tank, but you'll see plenty that encourage you to go either mostly AP or mostly AD.  It'd not that she can't build tank, it's just that going tank for her is kind of weak and a lot of people like her as more of a bruiser or assassin.\n\nHer 2 most common items are {{item:3078}} {{item:3153}}.  I'm sorry but I just don't see those two items as her most popular core items as being a tank.  She's got a 77% winrate with IE.  Yes it's rare on her, but yes it's that good on her too.\n\nStatistically she's not played as a tank:\nhttp://www.lolking.net/champions/poppy\nhttp://champion.gg/champion/Poppy\nhttp://www.leagueofgraphs.com/champions/items/poppy\n\nFrankly, as someone who plays poppy from time to time, you only really build tank if your team needs a tank and you are falling behind.  She's just so much more fun and better if you are building heavy offense.  I really wish you all would reconsider this.\n\n1.  She's not played mainly as a tank ATM, she's a hybrid DD first.\n2.  She's an effective chaser/killer.\n3.  While she can be a linebacker in a pinch, she lacks the CC a tank needs.  No one wants a CC less tank and to be honest her theme doesn't allow for much CC.\n4.  While her hard initiation does make her tanky, it's less about setting up the team (as a tank should) and more about 6 seconds where you are free to scatter and murder the other team.  It's more akin to tryndamere's ult:  press R to kill freely.  \n5.  Her role in the game is kind of like Jax's back when he was OP or Vayne's: get to late game and then go crazy on the other team.  That's not a tank's late game.  She's a hypercarry/anti-carry (assassin).  \n6.  She's more popular in the jungle and if you make her a tank, that's going to kill her.  Most tanks just don't work in the jungle anymore.  If you make her a dedicated tank, you are just going to hurt her in the long run.\n7.  She's capable of putting out a lot of damage with her Q and has an AA steroid in her W.  Those two things are more in line with fighters.\n8.  She's a great example of a hypercarry.  To be honest I can't think of many other melee hypercarries.  Jax and fiora come to mind.  We can't lose her as a melee hypercarry, the game needs her to stay like this.  \n9.  She's something like eve that we can't lose from the game: a champ who is free to build as your team/game needs.  She can go AD, AP, or tank.  Whereas Evelynn is more subtle, Poppy's a riot.  We need her as a jack of all trades that is distinct from Eve.  \n\nSo I have to ask, why does riot see her as a tank (in riot's definition of a tank) when it's plainly clear that a lot of her fans don't?  Should you keep those players in mind first when it comes to the rework?  A lot of the popular guides that I've read have her pegged as a hypercarry (yes there are some tank guides, but ATM she's like eve in that she can build towards what her team needs).","replies":[{"poster":"Doctor Jarvis","date":"2015-07-26T02:27:34.602+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"The thing is that, even though no one plays her like a tank, her kit sort of reads tank, or at least a confused fighter with tank in there. Her passive makes her pretty hard to burst down or kill in general and her ult gives her a lot of survivability and the ability to hang around in the middle of the fight, and in general that's the champion Riot wants her to be. And tank is the proper term for a fighter that does that. If her kit is updated, in keeping with her identity as a glowing ball of death in the middle of a fight, I agree they should give her more tank","replies":[{"poster":"Linna Excel","date":"2015-07-26T02:50:01.111+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"That's the big problem.  Thematically, yes she's supposed to take damage.  Mechanically, which I feel is more important because this is a game, she's played as a damage dealer; the tank is just there to give her the time she needs to get to the carry in order to delete the carry.  \n\nMost assassins in the game either come in from the side, play clean up (katarina), or have some trick to get to the carry (leblanc).  Poppy is the assassin that just charges straight in and chases the carry down.\n\nI think she's a problem mainly because of thematics vs gameplay.  This is the problem with ranged champs vs bruisers in LOL and it's been a problem for ages.  Just ask Hashinshin.  Melee champs need to have a way to get close to do their job.  Poppy's way of getting in there to do her job has been speed plus ignoring damage/cc.  \n\nHer job though is an assassin/DD.  That's why riot can't focus on tank.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2015-07-26T03:03:09.781+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not sure if tank is the best fit.

Doesn't this seem more than a little stereotypical to you?  That honorable people are only around to wear armor like good little meatshields and not do damage?  I can't help but feel like the gaming world is a little prejudiced against paladins as if they were masochistic submissives who flagellate themselves as a hobby.\n\nI mean look at all those martial arts films.

It seems to me a lot of games (DnD 4e, WoW, etc) take the honorable role and equate that directly to soaking up damage as the only thing an honorable person does.  While there's certainly a part of that in honorable behavior I feel like too many games go in the direction of if honorable then tank.  \n\nHowever if you look at real life tanks (tanks, calvary in the middle ages, battleships), yes they had heavy armor but they also had a ton of killing power.  You needed armor to stand up to the other guy's big guns and you needed big guns to get through his armor.  A calvary's armor wasn't meant for him to sit around and block for the archers, it was for him to be able to literally run over the opposing force's foot solders and devastate their lines.  Mechanically the only game I've seen do that really was the original GW with their warrior class.\n\nHere's a great example of an honorable person who lacked armor, got into the middle of a lot of fights, and was a deadly warrior: Obiwan Kanobi.  He could go through drones and arms like no one's business.  \n\nSo what I'm trying to get at is honorable shouldn't equate to being happy to sit back and take damage on one hand and in terms of Poppy show that her inclusion of tank is less because she's supposed to be a tank (see my other posts in this thread) and more about how she enables herself to do her role: hypercarrying/anti-carrying.  \n\nAs myself and others have said, she's a hypercarry and I think that's what her players really want out of her.  I just needed to bring this up because it was a moment where I could talk about my other pet peeve which is honorable people being forced into the meatshield role exclusively.","replies":[{"poster":"Retillin","date":"2015-07-27T15:41:32.007+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's... really well said.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"FireBison","date":"2015-07-31T10:49:10.045+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm going to argue and say poppy isn't exactly honorable.
