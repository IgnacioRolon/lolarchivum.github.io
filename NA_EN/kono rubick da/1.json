Rather Yasuo simply denied Galio the time of day due to some bit of conflict within the coding. Probably having to deal with a bug in the Taunt's effective range, or the fact that Yasuo was already slowed and for whatever reason Galio's taunt didn't stack ontop of the slow, rather it just got pushed out of the way. If you look closely at the moment Galio Ults Yasuo twitches back to face Galio before continuing on with the preset pathing.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Duke Anax","date":"2015-11-16T22:24:29.519+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"is it me or is that galio getting bigger during ult?","replies":[]},{"poster":"DorkunedAuras","date":"2015-11-14T19:11:48.038+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Taunts as a whole feels broken, Rammus is also suffering","replies":[]},{"poster":"Coolwhip191","date":"2015-11-15T01:57:48.893+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Better gut yasuo amirite?","replies":[]}]}
