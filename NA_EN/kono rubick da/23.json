Not to mention it's addition was spiteful against mages, as it allows them to heal off of abilities, when they already get massive heals from critical hits. Death's dance was a niche item until riot buffed it, mages had survivability until they deleted wota; neither were surprising.\n\nBuffed other niche items by granting even more critical chance. I remember when a marksman had to choose if they wanted 100% criticals or some tactical options such as armor penetration or lifesteal, but that choice isn't a problem now. You can reach 100% in 4 items, and not even a specific set either, you can swap out a few as you like.\n\nThey also were given alternatives of several items to assist them. Want to chunk multiple enemies at a time, pick up hurricane or static shiv. Want to shred tanks, now you can with excessive force or sustain removal. Want to drain your way through any encounter, five items to choose from, each with different extra effects. Want to counter mages, you can deny their crowd control or have a backup shield without sacrificing offensive power. Want to play as a hit and run champion, rapidfire cannon and phantom dancer can help with that. \n\nThe essence reaver was a rarely seen item as it was a counterpart to manamune, restoring a meager percentage of mana on every auto-attack; but was changed to only work off of critical hits, and grant more cooldown reduction based on your critical hit chance, making it the only item that can bring 30% cdr by itself! Normally wouldn't be a problem except that said patch also reworked several marksmen to give them some safety ability.","replies":[{"poster":"What Is Smite","date":"2017-08-25T06:01:02.069+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"Game until Season 5 = Morello as Lead Balancer, Season 6 = Meddler and Ghostcrawler Lead Balancers","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2017-08-25T08:05:10.293+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=What Is Smite,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=m7EdtpGg,comment-id=00050000,timestamp=2017-08-25T06:01:02.069+0000)\n>\n> Game until Season 5 = Morello as Lead Balancer, Season 6 = Meddler and Ghostcrawler Lead Balancers\n\nMaybe \"Better nerf Irelia\" wasn't so bad after all.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cosmic Warper","date":"2017-08-25T15:34:19.149+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=What Is Smite,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=m7EdtpGg,comment-id=00050000,timestamp=2017-08-25T06:01:02.069+0000)\n>\n> Game until Season 5 = Morello as Lead Balancer, Season 6 = Meddler and Ghostcrawler Lead Balancers\n\nMorello hated healers for good reason.

Lower elo is all about coin flips and once you get that advantage you can just right click and stat check them.","replies":[{"poster":"Jamenawerl","date":"2017-08-25T10:18:53.153+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeah sure, until you get in range of an assassin/mage combo and he instagibs you before you can right click. Pro-tip: They arent juggernauts and they actually outrange you.\n\nIt is the most demanding role mechanically, even one mistake, one bad click trying to kite, position yourself or dodge a skillshot and you are instantly DEAD.\n\nThe \"problem\" (well, it is not technically a problem if they are supposed to be hypercarries) is that lategame they dont have any counterplay besides killing them, so even if they are very hard to play properly, if you are good you can become unstoppable. If you are some random scrub tho, you will just fuck up and die. A lot.\n\nThey are also very support reliant, that may be another problem to be adressed. TBH juggermaw compositions are really stupid right now. But in yoloQ that rarely happens.","replies":[{"poster":"GayFluffyUnicorn","date":"2017-08-25T15:39:58.710+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I kinda believe most of you don't even know what mechanics are. \nKiting and positioning has nothing to do with mechanics. \nAnimation cancelling, using AA resets properly, stutter stepping and orbwalking/attackmoving those things are mechanics. \nNot getting hit by skillshots and positioning right applies to 80% of the roster. \nOnly tanks really don't care about since they need to soak up. Do you think a full damage camille or GP don't need to do the same things as marksmen?","replies":[{"poster":"Jamenawerl","date":"2017-08-25T18:32:19.612+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"> Kiting has nothing to do with mechanics.\n\n.\n> orbwalking/attackmoving those things are mechanics.\n\n?\n\nSure bro.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Jamenawerl","date":"2017-08-25T10:14:46.482+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Lel no, in low elos where no one knows how to position himself and even the support gives 0 fucks about peeling ADCs are basically free kills.\n\nI would rather play some mage or assassin bot in those elos.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
