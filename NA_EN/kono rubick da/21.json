Patch 5.22 had a bug in it which took out the armor+mr which was meant to scale up over time to make towers incredibly more tanky than before. Lazer turrets do much more DPS than a standard tower, but the community acts like it does less. The tower shield buff was broken and removed because it basically killed split pushing and sieging which is why last season was such a teamfight meta.\nOther tower buffs have included towers targetting quicker and completing their attack no matter what(end of season 4), towers taking reduced damage for the first few minutes of the game(mid season 4 I think?), and towers gaining much more armor without any minions around.\n\nAt the beginning of season 4 you could literally walk up to inhib towers with a split pusher and no minions and solo it with 80% of your health remaining. It was common to take two inhibs+inhib towers with your tank not even taking any damage if you out-rotated your opponent.\n\nThe \"community\" is basically every rager on the forum than got outplayed on a tower dive and came to complain.
