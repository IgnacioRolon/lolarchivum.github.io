No it doesn't. He heals about the same as he did before, actually less if there's less than 4 champs he's fighting against because they decreased the Raven-per-second (lol) and increased the maximum Ravens to 5.

AP build a {{item:3165}}  and ADs build {{item:3033}} . Grab an early game {{item:3123}}  and it's like Swain has no healing at all. Dodge snares and avoid his Raven that drops a circle and you're good. Also, {{item:3139}} can save you\n","replies":[]}]}]}]}
