Look at AP mages, in the mage update, you pretty much gave a lot more health to them, adc's have black cleaver, since its becoming a bit more popular, you have GA, merc cept, banshees, maw, steraks, etc. It would be nice to put the ball back in the hands of assassins like it used to be. Assassins are forced to build tankier now because of this, otherwise, they instantly die.

If Riot lowers the speed of their kills, they'll likely have to put other systems in their kits, which have historically been abused by tank builds (Tank Ekko, Tank Akali, Tank Kat back in the day).  \n\nAdditionally, I think Riot far undervalues the importance of a fast kill in a teamfight.  Even if the assassin trades 1 for 1, if they prevent their opponent from doing their job, the fight is still 5 contributions vs 4 contributions.  In terms of surviving champs, it looks like a 4v4, but if you go consider cooldowns and how the fight plays out, it's still largely successful for assassins to \"fail\" and go 1-for-1.  \n\nBut 1-for-1 isn't what I'm worried about, it's when Riot gives these champs resets (Kat), sustain (Akali), CC (Ekko), etc.  Player feel aside, I honestly think one-kill-and-done burst assassins are healthier than the Ekko/Akali/Kat's of the world.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Aptest","date":"2016-06-30T18:19:23.602+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":3,"body":"Can you guys design an ADC who is to assassins what assassins are to other ADCs? \n(would be hilarious to read the qq on the forums)\n(I.E. your counterplay is don't get caught out of position (= stay out of engage range) and have the support nearby with ult ready)","replies":[{"poster":"zlumpy","date":"2016-06-30T18:27:59.877+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Like an adc that can use an ult to single someone out and whenever they get close to you it just pushes them backwards and does a medium magic dmg hit for a few seconds?

Bruisers and assassin's try to dive the enemy ADC and kill the ASAP and mages try to nuke the carries, and settle for AoEing the divers, or the peelers if they can't reach their target.","replies":[{"poster":"Battlecast Sona","date":"2016-07-01T06:53:12.954+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"What's wonderful about carries in DotA2 is that they don't always work the way you're accustomed to in League, and their curve is MUCH harder than a League carries. A large percentage of DotA2 carries absolutely cannot be left alone in lane unless the laner is specifically a matchup that can't kill them - and because of deny mechanics it's much easier to make a carry miss CS. Due to how scaling works in DotA2 (it's much harder to increase the damage of your abilities outright in a meaningful way), a physical damage carry will eventually be required. But that physical damage carry can be any number of carries, all of whom work in completely different ways. I mean, Phantom Assassin and Anti-Mage are both carries, but they function in very different ways, and both of them function differently from Spectre.\n\nTo illustrate:\nPhantom Assassin carries hard because her ultimate is a steroid that gives her one of the highest damage crits in the game. She generally utilizes this in tandem with her blink to attempt to quickly jump to a target and kill them before they can react - she plays much more like an assassin than a traditional carry. Her blink however needs a target, so her escape options are limited in comparison to her engage options. She works great with teams with a lot of hard engage or who have another damage threat that may need to be focused down, allowing her to destroy the backline.\n\nAnti-Mage takes reduced damage from nukes and has a blink on a very short CD. Additionally, he drains mana with his AAs (and can nuke you with damage that increases based on missing mana). Anti-Mage is fairly weak early (needs a lot of levels in all of his skills on top of items to scale into a damage threat, though cheesy level 6 kills are not impossible and he's hard to gank). He's a very strong splitpusher and can 1v1 people very easily. Anti-Mage generally spends the early part of the game pushing a lane until battlefury and then utilizing his blink to quickly farm in the jungle (blinking between camps and into lanes to accelerate his farming speed). He can work great with push comps because he can quickly rotate to fights and splitpush easily.\n\nSpectre is a carry who literally carries by standing in the middle of the enemy team. She generally is fairly weak until 2-3 items, but you also generally build items like Radiance (a damage item that functions similar to Sunfire) and utilizing her second ability, which reduces a percentage of the damage she takes and deals that damage to the units around her (higher damage to closer units). She also has a global ultimate that creates copies of herself (which can use her Radiance burn), and she can choose to teleport to one of the illusions. Spectre is generally very good when your team lacks a tanky frontliner but has initiation tools or ways to assist you in setting up fights or picks.\n\nNone of these carries carry in the same way. They all operate completely differently, and different items are good on them, but they're ALL agility carries.\n\nDotA2 has the right idea - carries that all function differently and work best with different kinds of teams. In League it feels a bit one-size-fits-all, which I think is why we only really see 2-3 carries in the spotlight at any given time.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Aptest","date":"2016-06-30T20:59:45.585+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"what's called a carry in dota and what's called a carry in league is world's apart.

Whereas in DOTA2 yes you call faceless void a carry but honestly when your carry can just ult the enemy top lane and 1v1 me bro with just a little bit of extra damage from the support you're not playing the same game.","replies":[{"poster":"Battlecast Sona","date":"2016-06-30T21:04:45.946+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"faceless void hasn't been a hard carry for a few patches now.\n\nThe major difference is that instead of having melee carries (Yi, Fiora, Tryn, etc) and ranged carries (ashe, ez, jinx, jhin, etc), where one is considered the \"hard carry\" because of their necessity for pushing towers (generally the ranged carry), in DotA2 a \"semi-carry\" (the equivalent of the melee carries above) is what someone like Tiny, Void, or Templar Assassin would be - characters without a traditional steroid (they don't have Drow Ranger's 80 AGI for free or Troll Warlord's tons of ASPD passives and ult), but who can be built to dish out significant physical damage. They generally can also be built in a more utility role (templar assassin being a great example of someone who can provide primarily utility and pick-potential or who can be your primary source of physical damage).\n\nYou can't directly compare the classes for two games that are completely different.\n\nIt also tickles me that you're like how about we talk Lina here: {{champion:143}} {{champion:161}} {{champion:1}} {{champion:63}} all played for the exact same reasons as Lina.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Profirix","date":"2016-06-30T18:26:53.228+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They should do what they did with Kalista and make it so bonus armor and MR are less effective on assassins, but make up for it by giving them more power or utility.

Graves also has an AD ratio on his basic attacks, Corky had one until recently, Kog'maw has one in mini-gun mode. And more generally, ratios on basic attacks are rather common.

Successive corki nerfs have had him weak for a while now so we'll see what happens with him. \n\nKoggers is an ability and that isn't as bad, like with jinx getting extra damage on rockets it costs mana and does more damage like an ability should. \n\nCrit chance (even if guaranteed in certain circumstances) is an on hit effect and is different than the base damage done on autos. Ashe for instance interacts with crit differently from others but that's different from scaling off bonus ad differently.","replies":[{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2016-07-01T05:03:01.376+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"My point was: it's relatively common that buying the same item on different markspeople does not scale their basic attacks the same way.\n\nYou can say that Crit is an on-hit and everything, but look at what buying Crit items does for Ashe, and you'll see it's exactly the same thing as what you were complaining about with Kalista.\n\n\"How much DPS does an IE add to your AA?\" Well, it depends, not the same if you are Ashe.\n\nSo I certainly agree with you that it's not perfect in terms of clarity. But saying that \"it's an awful design choice\", that's quite a bit stronger, and I disagree with that.\n\nAlso, regarding Corky, you mentioned power levels, but that's a completely different topic. Current Kalista would probably be OP if you removed the passive all of a sudden, and that doesn't prove this kind of ratios are a good thing, no more than removing it from Corky and making him balanced proved it was a good thing.\n\nRatio on AA are just yet another balance lever among many. The important question, the one we started to discuss in the beginning, is: is it a good/useful lever, or does it have too many drawbacks (e.g. clarity/burden of knowledge, etc.)? For me it's a good lever, and the problem you mentioned isn't really a problem, since all other abilities already have a ratio, so this kind of variability in the value of a given stat between different champions already exist. But that's an open question, I certainly don't know the absolute truth.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"YJRBqwXJcS","date":"2016-06-30T18:29:18.245+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Ekwi8Qq7,comment-id=00020001,timestamp=2016-06-30T18:18:06.697+0000)\n>\n> We&#x27;re still expecting assassins post changes to kill squishy targets in one ability rotation generally.

Whenever a bruiser/assassin flash engages onto him he gets killed before he can even get the stun off so he can peel back and defend himself with his W.\n\nbasically what im asking is allow his Q to work like anivia's ","replies":[]}]}]}]}
