They could want us to make a large number of other characters really powerful turret killers. They could want a bunch sustained physical damage casters (like physical damage Karthus or something). Or it could be any of a number of other reasons.\n\nBasically, it's unclear, to me at least, why exactly it's more ideal for marksmen to be less important. This may not be the perfect example, but football teams have quarterbacks on every team, and that seems to be perfectly satisfactory there.\n\nFor what it's worth, I'm not saying I personally think it wouldn't be be more interesting if marksmen were less necessary.

To be honest, I'm not sure the juggernaut rework was a success and I honestly think a new champion should have been introduced instead, but this can serve as a learning experience for future (and hopefully more successful) attempts.\n\nThe problem with Morde, imo, is that he's either useless or overbearing in the bot lane. The exp passive is rather tacked on I feel, but I feel like a similar mechanic can work in the future with the same goal: teamwork.\n\nBasically, marksman are kind of weak on their own early game, but are strong when partnered with a support. Sure, it's easier to land skillshots when the enemy is cc'd by any class, but champions like Draven or Vayne get the most \"oomph\" out of it. I think that can be applied to future champions of any class, designed around having a partner early game and team orientated late-game just like ADC's, but not turned into another utility mage or tank that goes bot lane. Maybe something like a champion that can chain cc with other champions (not themselves), or naturally reduces critical damage, or whatever else.\n\nI feel like it is possible. If ADC's can go top lane, sometimes mid, and nowadays even jungle, I think it's time we accept that *some* of them are capable of solo laning, and make it so bot lane is more accessible instead of just booting ADC's out of the game. Not that I'm accusing you guys of anything.\n\nAlso Doran's shield should probably be looked at.","replies":[{"poster":"Daen","date":"2015-10-22T15:47:05.235+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":">Also Doran's shield should probably be looked at.\n\nAs in it's currently too weak or too strong?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sire Hippington","date":"2015-10-22T15:05:35.609+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"not really, morde is in no way different from anny other bruiser lane, he relys on cheese stuff(W-xp and dragon) to snowball early, and if he can't, he falls off hard compared to an adc.\nHis Powercurve is porbably the most extreme in the game http://champion.gg/champion/Mordekaiser/ADC\nfrom 70% win at 0-25min straigh down to 48.2% win at 40+min","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"KONO RUBICK DA","date":"2015-10-22T12:04:20.348+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RiotRepertoir,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=YprrjAGg,comment-id=000500020000,timestamp=2015-10-22T06:02:16.292+0000)\n>\n> This is the opinion I expected to hear from most people on this subject, and the one that I personally resonate pretty strongly with.\n> \n> To me personally, I don't necessarily have an issue with marksmen except for their relative monopoly over the duo lane carry position.

I know players seem to want this, but it's actually not clear to me exactly how they want it.\n>\n> just not sure I understand what the intended outcome is, and why that outcome is more desirable.\n\n\nI think an ultimate goal expands from 'Marksman  Update'. The outcome I'd want asks for radical change. Radical change needs to be prepared and accepted in avid LoL players (propaganda still works today).\n\nStarting with Marksmen I suppose _may_ be a first-step though the radical suggestion I preach requires all 'balance changes' to weave a focus to the ultimate redevelopment. I have no idea what's been focused upon over 6 years but it's about time something was made clear: A CLEAR LONG-TERM VISION FOR A CONSISTENT & STABLE PRODUCT.\n\n1. If Kit were made more important than Items **(Kit > Items)**:\n * **Simplified Items:** Abilities come strictly from Kit and not from Items (Items become 'salt & pepper' instead of a 'side order'). Items will not allow for significant unique abilities like Actives (e.g. Zhonya's).\nIn redevelopment, Item's role would simply become steroids reflecting team's progression without adverse effects against enemy. Adversity comes from player's and team's ability to perform extraordinarily. Dependency on Item's decreased; Reliance on player activity is increased.\n _(I understand this may not make sense. It's a radical suggestion)_  \n  * **Equalizer Items:** Champion compositions made less incompatible _with_ or _against_ each other as Items are repurposed for seemingly poor champion compositions (Kit) made bearable in almost any match (Items). Versatility.\nIntended things: confidence in team comp. and champ-select, and clarifying item decisions: For Me, For Team, ~~For Both~~.\n * **Defined Roles:** With Kits becoming the priority their roles are refined. The _excessive_ learning of the this game is reduced from which players will excel quicker and further. These  Kits offer _clear_ options at champ-select: pre-game becomes easier, quicker and with confidence!\n2. If Items were made more important than Kit **(Items > Kit)**:\n * **Kit Value:** Redundancy may happen when Items continue to show more importance than Kit. This sounds like old ADC, doesn't it? Confidence in champion-select becomes difficult when Items builds manipulate too much.\n  The excess here causes several problems, I think. Kits may offer advantages allowing Items to work better but why should we think so hard about these when most of the gameplay is about combat, tactics and strategy? More thinking; less playing: Kit is not enough. Imagine trying to walk in quicksand. This is LoL.\n * **Last Hit:** Game is to destroy the Nexus by having control over lanes. Not last hit monotony. Item dependency falls onto Gold Income and Last Hit dependency. Last Hit is inconsistent in all parts of the game and causes tension against strong champ-counters. Even the guessing part when to right-click is _so_ fucking frustrating. Current system may remain for what it may do ..but updated to keep both teams equally competitive through-out entire match (Item purchases happen at relatively same time between teams).\n * **Chaos Theory:** Hemorrhage. Where confidence in a decision and action should deliver it is constantly tested or inhibited instead. Why? [Too much stuff going on](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/ptf7T0AA-riots-not-being-fair-with-their-balancing?comment=0005), maybe?\n\n___\n___\n\n\nLike with Black Market Brawlers, as a separate game-type we could have Items with outstanding effects. This way, the _real_ game is kept fair and tolerant while the other game-type is there for people to just 'over-indulge' peaking those fun levels. Though this segregates casual and genuine players they are both appeased. In my mind, it would also form cohesion between 'pro' and 'real' players. **This additional idea puts this post's message into perspective**.\n\nTwo game-types: **Normal **&** Gravy**.\n\n * [**Normal** gametype]: After many changes including Items, 'normal' game is defined and sanitized. (Fair Game; Kits)\n * [**Gravy** gametype]: On top of a redeveloped game, insanity is kept with additional excessive old and new crazy items.

Imagine making even more carries like Morde that rely on their allies. The balance team's current response to high vitality, aggressive champions is to nerf them. But why not buff marksmen? Not so they can compete with a Maokai+Mordekaiser bot lane, but so they can take their farm game to top lane: defensive options that are basically limited to avoiding ganks and avoiding 1 shots. ADs consistently going top will effectively force tanky playmaking champions down to bottom, which (if you made more ally reliant carries morde) would be even more fun!
