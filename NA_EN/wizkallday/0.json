If I had known a suspension was next I never would have flamed and i&#039;d still be playing their game and prolly buying skins during that 2 week if they hadn&#039;t suspended me without a warning. I believe if riot added the warning it would make it a lot more fair to the player to be suspended if they continue their behavior after getting the warning that &quot; hey! don&#039;t flame otherwise you&#039;re getting suspended&quot;. That&#039;s all they needed and I couild still be happy with my full pool of champions... now I have 20 for the next week with no skins and I&#039;m sad.
