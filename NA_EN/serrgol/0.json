Its only really excessive against high health champs but that's it stick.\n\nAnd your description of garen is pretty accurate, unlike champs like fiora/riven he can't dash every 5 seconds if he hits a minion or spammable Qs and needs that sorta execute style ult to finish low people when he get close before they dash away and he gets kited to death by them.\nNow the ult passive true damage onhit is the only reasonable part you could complain about on this champ, and I honestly think it needs to go it's unfair.\n\nHonestly she would be equally fucked in this scenario if it was a pyke or urgot (who can execute tanky champs at like 1000hp) or any execute really and some ones like riven actually scale with the damage they build and ain't even single target.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-03-31T00:30:25.417+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And their point is it is fair because you can avoid it by not being bad.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Sona Ping","date":"2019-03-31T01:06:16.533+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Serrgol,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=cbLtdpxK,comment-id=000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2019-03-31T00:18:53.746+0000)\n>\n> im not asking what he does. i am asking why is it balanced in riots eyes.\n\nIt is balanced because read what the ability does already.","replies":[{"poster":"Serrgol","date":"2019-03-31T01:19:06.247+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"so because it says what it does it means it balanced XDD definetly","replies":[{"poster":"xDogMeatx","date":"2019-03-31T05:17:55.104+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you think garen is very op just play him a bunch of times till you drop you will find his faults by then.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sona Ping","date":"2019-03-31T01:24:13.010+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Serrgol,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=cbLtdpxK,comment-id=00000000000000000000000000010000,timestamp=2019-03-31T01:19:06.247+0000)\n>\n> so because it says what it does it means it balanced XDD definetly\n\nNo, but if you read it instead of deciding to spend two hours refusing to go to Step #1 and arguing with people, if you did read that you would see what is happening and realize there's no problem here.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"True Garen","date":"2019-04-01T05:02:21.580+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Garen is a teaching champion, not just for the one playing him but for everybody in his game.
