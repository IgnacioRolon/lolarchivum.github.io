It would happen sporadically throughout a game I would be walking up to attack minions or walking away back to my turret, I click or use an ability and my whole champion just walks in a straight path and then all of a sudden it's like the time skips forward and my ability I casted went off and I'm even walking in the direction I clicked. I lose a whole 5 seconds sometimes where I have no idea what's going on. I'd appreciate any help on this I can get. This never used to happen, I'd say just the past couple months. Please help Rito I don't know what to do!\r\n\r\nThanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-30T03:27:49.199+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Most of the time when you're getting those random huge lag spikes but never see any kind of ping or FPS changes it can actually be more related to something called packet loss.

I'll try it once more though and then I'll open a ticket. Appreciate the response.","replies":[]}]}]}
