I go to play a 5 real people against 5 bots and the other 4 people on my team ended up all being bots trying to lvl accounts to sell them at lvl 30. I can not believe that nothing is being done about this.","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rd1k6YreFa8&feature=youtu.be","image":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rd1k6YreFa8/hqdefault.jpg"},"up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have enjoyed playing bots for a little bit now and I have noticed that the people that are supposedly players are not what they appear. They always run mid and always feed and every once in awhile they type something in chat like \"frozen\" or \"WTF\". This ruining my experience with this game because I can not win after three bots go legendary due to the cheating program users that are making \"bots\" to easily lvl to 30 and sell the account. \r\n\r\nWhat is being done about this? I have never gotten a message saying that my report got answered or anything. You are just allowing this?","replies":[{"poster":"BONSAI MAZTER","date":"2016-05-17T22:41:44.203+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That does help some. I tried playing in the pvp mode and it seems they are there as well. I will just try and look at this as trying to just get to 30 whether I win or lose. I just hope it gets solved quick because they make it nearly impossible to win. I enjoy bot play, also wish they were a bit more difficult. Like, maybe implement a way for them to jungle. Would be neat. \n\nThanks for the information by the way :D","replies":[]},{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-05-17T21:28:12.060+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We definitely don't condone the use of bots to power level accounts to 30.  We actively search for these accounts and ban them as quickly as possible.  It definitely sucks that you experienced some bots in your game and I want to apologize for that.  We are constantly working on different ways to detect bots even faster so that they do not ruin further games.\n\nI hope this sheds some light on things!","replies":[]}]}
