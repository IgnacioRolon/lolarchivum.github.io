All had typical bot names and spells. TWO GAMES IN A ROW.\n\nThis is completely ridiculous, one or more major botters are FLOODING the matchmaking queues with incredible numbers of bots, presumably to level them up to 30 and sell them for real money to toxic players who got banned and want to come back at 30. The whole thing is steeped in toxicity and Riot needs to find a way to consistently identify and permaban these bots in time to make it not worth it to the bot runners. It&#039;s making the level 1-29 game utterly terrible since League is a team game and bots play much worse than the newest of new real players, typically going 0/20+/0 and feeding so hard I&#039;ve even seen them force a few losses to Riot&#039;s own bots, which, for all their faults, play the game substantially better. I&#039;ve had to dodge ARAM games because of this and had 30 minute delays because SOMEONE ELSE was breaking the rules on 4 individual accounts SIMULTANEOUSLY.\n\nSomething must be done. The people running these bots in such aggressive quantity need to be punished severely - ideally with a lifetime ban from League of Legends that somehow keeps them from ever making another account to sell.\n\nOther players: Don't forget to confirm bots by asking them to chat (bots can't,) then report them after any games you do play with them for Cheating (bot program), Feeding (they're usually 0/20+/0) and AFK (there's no one at their keyboard, just a program.) The Player Behavior team can't ban bots they don't know are botting.\n\nHere are some things I've noticed about common bots:\nBots are usually named in all lowercase and/or gibberish, use the default or Tibbers Summoner Icon, aren't in any clubs and tend not to have a mastery selected at levels 18-29, sometimes even 30. Many bots do not have detection for reaching 30 and continue to run until the next time the owner checks them and finally sees they've reached 30 for sale. Bots tend to favor Mark, Ghost, Heal, Barrier, Ignite and Flash as Summoner Spells; virtually no bots use Clarity, Smite, Exhaust or Teleport. A few use Cleanse.\nThe vast majority of bots never use chat or pings at all. The remainder use them incoherently unless there's a handler keeping an eye on the bot. Most handlers are on a team with 5 bots. Most bots will leave the post-game chat immediately - anyone who doesn't should be asked if they're a bot in post-game chat BEFORE reporting them, just to be sure. It's generally the point where a human player is the most likely to actually respond, other than champion select, since the game is over.\nBots often have horrible loading times (failing to even start loading for long periods) due to being massively multiboxed; they also often disconnect and reconnect a lot for the same reason.\nBots usually either buy no items at all or buy many duplicates of a base item instead of buying upgrades. Bots will often group up behind a tower letting it get destroyed while at full health themselves. Sometimes they will just walk back and forth near spawn to defeat the AFK detection, especially if they die a lot early on. Bots tend to attack minions and will sometimes completely ignore all 5 enemy champions beating on them.\nBots usually go 0/20+/0 KDA, but this is one of the shakiest criteria because sometimes they get lucky - either against another bot, with an OP champ, or against a bad/bored/aggressive opponent in general.\n\nI would like to see random CAPTCHAs that only come up if you have some bot-resembling reports, and come up more often the more bot-like reports you get.","replies":[{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2017-03-03T23:15:23.545+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bots killed Dominion.

And Riot still doesn't seem to be responding to the issue... this is bad. This tends to filter new blood coming into the game towards players who don't care about anything and tend to make bad teammates, while scaring off the ones who actually want to be part of a team and work together to achieve victory. I suppose at this rate some new players might not even realize your teammates in coop are supposed to be humans... the flood of 3rd party bots is just that bad.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SilverArc","date":"2017-03-04T12:45:04.429+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes i agree and i am fed up of feeders, bots its not fair.
