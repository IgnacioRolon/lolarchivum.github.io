The 'submit' button doesn't exist. On my screen it's just the word submit in grey. No button no nothing. Same on my phone I can't reply to the dang ticket so I resorted to emailing them... which will probably take ages now.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-07-27T20:22:09.238+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's strange!  Are you using any extensions that could be getting in the way?  As long as you're logged into the ticketing center you should be fine to reply.  What happens if you try running Incognito or another browser?  What's your ticket number, anything I can run by your Specialist?","replies":[{"poster":"Parises","date":"2017-07-27T22:59:48.677+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think I'm okay now, I resorted to first sending an email to the support about my ticket-- which subsequently started another ticket. But then I found I could reply to the ticket directly from my email so all is well.","replies":[]}]}]}
