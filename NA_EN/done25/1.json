If old Irelia E stunned instead of conditionally stunning people, she would have been significantly nerfed. Conditional power always plays a significant role in a champions power level, most of the times resulting in the champion being balanced around them being able to trigger it reliably, especially when it has a significant impact.\n\nBack to the topic, denying an ADC this combo {{item:1038}} {{item:3504}} will lead to a huge drop in their DPS.
