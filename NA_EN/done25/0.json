As soon as he dies the enemy just steps about 5 feet away, launches any kind of CC in his direction, and he's dead from bleed out before he can even take 3 steps.\r\nThree suggestions:\r\n1: Shorter or no wind up - This makes it harder for people to simply just walk away from him.\r\n2: His speed booster removes/ignores slows on cast - This way one single slow, possible an AoE not even aimed at him(!), wont render him completely useless.\r\n3: Slower bleed out - Rather than him losing a percent of his HP every second, make him lose a flat amount. That way Sion's extra HP will help him survive longer, rather than just causing him lose even more health every second.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Scruffy","date":"2014-10-10T03:23:36.940+0000","up_votes":25,"down_votes":1,"body":"Flat amount on HP decay makes sense.

The more HP you have the 'less' time your passive lasts.\n\nWith a lower HP build you can heal up using that 100% life steal and keep yourself healthy where as with high HP you cant heal faster than the HP loss which makes the passive last less time.\n\nYour end game goal is to be a brusier, but because of the inverse useful ness of HP on his passive you want to minimize your maximum HP, while maximizing your damage and resistances.\n\nSame issue with old sion, build brusier, your Shield was useless, build AP your ultimate was useless.  There wasn't a consistant theme between his skills.","replies":[{"poster":"bloodmoth","date":"2014-10-09T23:11:18.899+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"its give or take, if you build full dps, you heal up for more, but you can get killed alot faster (which your forgetting), if you build hp, you can tank a few more hits and have a chance to catch them, but your lifesteal wont be as impactful, which option is better depends on how the fight plays out, build tanky and you can get to them, build squishy, you wont get to them, but if you do you will last longer.\n\nAlso i dont think that your understanding the whole 10%maxHP on hit part of it, where it doesnt care what damage your doing, you will heal up 10% of whatever your opponents hp is.\n\nHow much uptime on his passive are you expecting to have? your acting like the fight will last long enough for the lifesteal to matter significantly. you heal up 10% of their max hp twice per second regardless of if you build AD crit or whatever, thats just gravy, but if you die just trying to make it to the foe your going to regen nothing, if you can stick to them they are likely to die and you are likely to survive long enough regardless\n\nthe numbers arent a problem, they really arent, its the practicality, its currently very hit or miss, much like most of his kit. that depends on how powerful you want it to be.","replies":[{"poster":"Rueian","date":"2014-10-09T23:21:29.196+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Unless you are hitting a tank that has more HP than you, that 10% on hit, if it is physical (mitigated by armor) wont heal you for squat. 10% of a squishy carry, is nothing, building AD and crit makes you hit that ADC for MUCH more than you think.\n\nBuilding more HP wont make you live longer because the other main issue is that he wont get a chance to even hit someone when he dies currently.  He dies to quickly from bleed-out, not from taking damage, and the bleed-out also ramps up the longer you are alive.  His passive is just a poorly thought out skill.  Hence 'passive is useless'\n\nWhile alive, building tanky is alright, but he still just gets outclassed other than his shield in damage and his inconsistant Q stun.  He has alot of soft CC.  But if you build bruiser with atma's you'll get ALOT more out of him.  And depending on how well your farming goes you can just build DPS and still be a very large tank.","replies":[{"poster":"bloodmoth","date":"2014-10-10T00:18:10.599+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"if you can catch a carry you will live long enough to kill them(they die faster), if you catch a tank, you will still live long enough to kill them. not sure what the problem is. building HP will make you live more, because if they turn on you and try to kill you, you will lose a greater % of HP from their hit, making you die quicker.

No one will attack you they will avoid you, except the ADC who can poke you at range.  They are going to drop 1 heavy slow or a stun/root on you and you die.  Building hp will not make you survive that more or less.
