Anyway, there is no proof that it was him and not me and it is my fault because the account security is in my hands. So, like most people, I filed a ticket seeing if anything can happen and was expecting it to be just automated messages and to take a long time. I was surprised that I got a message in less than a day and actually had a decent conversation with one of the player behavior employees. The messages were not automated and the employee was helpful. The reason I am posting this is because I only see negative comments about the staff on here so I thought I would post a good one. Needless to say I did not get my account back but I have definitely learned my lesson - keep your account secure.\n\nEdit: People are asking how my account was taken -  when I left the room my cousin used a USB and put a keylogger on my computer.

I promptly (in almost 16 hours) received a sympathetic reply and got the champion and skin.\n\nIn the second one, I was curious about a certain aspect of Riot Merchandise. When I attended Worlds Semifinals, I wanted to bring home a souvenir, so after much deliberation, I decided to bring home the Championship Riven figure. The saleswoman said that I would get CS Riven 2016 on my account as well. I asked her if I would get the skin if I didn't own the champion. She instantly replies \"No.\" So I don't buy the merchandise. Later, I check Riot's Merchandise Page and find nothing supporting or refuting the saleswoman's answer. Then I check Riot's Support page, and one of their articles seems to imply that I would have gotten the champion and skin. So I send in a ticket asking who is right: the saleswoman or Picture of Horse? I get an email saying that Riot Support is busy and may take longer to reply than normal. Five days go by, and it's a day before the finals. Riot Merch page says that the skin deal only lasts throughout Worlds, so I'm panicking, because the Finals mark the end of Worlds and I have no reply from Riot Support. I decide that I trust Picture of Horse more, and I purchase the figure.\nI do end up getting the skin and champion, but since I received no personalized Support (I had to rely only on the pretty helpful Support page), my Support experience was only all right.
