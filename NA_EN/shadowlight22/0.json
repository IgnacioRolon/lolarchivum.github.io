I didn't realize an Amazon account requires another payment option other than the gift card to use it. I persuaded my parents to lend to me their credit card to put on the account temporarily to spend the gift card money since they won't be charged anything anyway. However, on the checkout it said the digital code had an estimated tax amount which would put me over the gift card funds into the credit card. I heard that it wasn't supposed to charge you tax for the digital code. Was I wrong? Please help me my fellow members of the league community if you have had experience with purchasing to rp on Amazon and know if they actually charge the tax. Thank you for any replies to this message and sorry that I am still a kid who is unable to open a banking account :( .","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-11T18:02:47.925+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"With my own experience with Amazon, I also thought that it could use the gift card as credit without other payment methods.  I'm such an Amazon addict that I'm ashamed to be wrong about that (it's where I get my poro snax)!  I also believe that taxes are [included where applicable](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=468512).  \n\nWhen you go to checkout your purchase, you should see a few areas that include Select Payment Method as well as More Payment Options just below it.  There will be a small extendable link called Enter a gift card or promotional code, and you should be able to add your gift card there.  If the tax goes over, then you may need to switch to a lower price.  Hope that helps, and good luck!","replies":[]}]}
