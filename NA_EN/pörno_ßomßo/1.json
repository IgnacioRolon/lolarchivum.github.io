The drop chance does reset approximately 30 days after you earn you first key fragment at the original drop chance.\n\nBecause of this, near the middle/end of this 30 day period, it's normal to not receive many or even any keys at all as the drop chance for them can be incredibly low (depending on how many you earned toward the beginning of the 30 day period), even if you queue with friends to increase it.\n\nFor more information about the Hextech Crafting system, you can check out [this guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207884233-Hextech-Crafting-Guide).","replies":[{"poster":"Pörno ßomßo","date":"2016-09-08T18:34:10.113+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So there will be no system check on the account ? Because sometimes could be hard to remember when the 30 day period started. You should put some feature like the treasure chest. Something that reminds you the % chance for the drop and/or something for the 30 period day.","replies":[{"poster":"Zombiemaster","date":"2016-09-08T18:44:35.517+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately, I don't think Riot has any plans to implement something like this. I agree that it would be nice to see this type of information, however, if Riot were to create something like this, I'm fairly certain it would be a very low priority.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-08T18:43:38.284+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because there isn't an exact amount of key shards you can earn each month, that type of feature wouldn't really work. *Zombiemaster* hit the explanation of the key fragment system right on the head. The key fragment droprate was designed this way to ensure it wasn't a grind fest and that players who don't have as much time to tons of matches wouldn't miss out on earning key fragments. \n\nAfter your droprate resets, you should start seeing key fragments again. Let me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]}]}
