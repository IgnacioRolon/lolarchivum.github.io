My friends say way worse than me and get away with it. I got the ban right when the Christmas break is about to start and now I can&rsquo;t play with my friends. Can you guys please reduce the ban or chat restrict me instead please I beg you\n\nI realize what I&rsquo;ve done wrong, but I do not think 14 days is necessary when others have said much worse. I would understand a chat restriction at most\n\nPre Game Lobby:\n    JulzFTW: shut up\n    JulzFTW: jk\n\n\nIn Game:\n    [All]JulzFTW: shitty ass yasuo\n    JulzFTW: %%%%%%ed ass shen\n    JulzFTW: dumbass motherfkr\n    JulzFTW: no but ur nan had this d\n    JulzFTW: shen youre actual ass\n    JulzFTW: dumbass kid\n    JulzFTW: shen you re actual shit\n    JulzFTW: excuse for a good player\n    JulzFTW: fkin ass kid\n    JulzFTW: jk\n    JulzFTW: jk\n    JulzFTW: jk\n    JulzFTW: k\n    JulzFTW: jk\n    JulzFTW: jk\n    JulzFTW: jk\n    JulzFTW: o_o\n    JulzFTW: reatrded ass shen\n    [All]JulzFTW: shut up\n    [All]JulzFTW: braindead %%%%\n    JulzFTW: t\n    JulzFTW: h\n    JulzFTW: h\n    JulzFTW: er\n    JulzFTW: shen you braindead ","replies":[]}
