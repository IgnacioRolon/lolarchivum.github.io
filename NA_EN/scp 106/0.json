WAY. WAY. to rewarding to the players for one. And maining her takes rewards to a new level to the point where enemies can barely do anything about it. I myself mained riven a good while and got her to my third most mastery points and almost hit gold because of it, A friend who was very bad at the game (no offense) started maining Riven and actually went on a HUGE WINSTREAK, LIKE HOLY FUCK I'M TALKING A GREEN MATCH HISTORY PAGE ALL POSITVE SCORE GAMES, VICTORY VICTORY VICTORY AND ONLY 1 LOST GAME OUT OF IT ALL. Went from bronze to platinum like it was nothing, And then I myself did the exact same thing, And made sure at every tower to kill the minions that came before attacking again.\n\n\nRivens hardcore strength comes from her not having any resource bar, She can farm with abilities and clear waves like it's nothing in no time, Meaning you can't hold her back from power farming, I also began invading the enemy jungle as much as possible whenever I was pushed up. and with Electrocute I was near unbeatable in 1v1's Even against my main counters such as Garen and renekton.\n\n\nRiven is also a late game champion meaning even after she stomps you in lane you have no real chance of fighting back, She has 4 dashes, a knock up a stun a shield and an execute ultimate that gives free AD.

Champs should have equal power when used optimally across all skill levels, but performance should definitely lag when skill champs arent used properly. Aka, part of the reward of maining a skill champ shouldn't be higher winrates than maining other champs, the reward is in mastering that champ. Long story short, skill curve should never factor into optimal use power budget. If a champ is weak it should be because the champ's kit is screwed up and needs to be nerfed until riot can out time into fixing the champ, aka azir, ryze, etc","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Scorpio Szn","date":"2019-01-17T00:42:54.429+0000","up_votes":28,"down_votes":4,"body":"I’ve always viewed riven as just a harder scaling version of Irelia that can even be viewed as better than her mid to late game.\n\n- Near god like mobility?

Matchups have to be learned over and over and her playstyle changes with every matchup. On top of it, Riven mains need to learn the playstyle in every scenario (for instance how to behave vs Renekton when he starts W or Q) This goes for any matchup. \n\n* Her cooldowns aren't low. All of her abilities before any CDR item is around 10 seconds. Yes, even E her shield. In harassing matchups Riven players often have to decide whether they want to go in with E to take that one cs before getting harassed too much and lose all cs before her E comes back again, or get all cs but end up with no hp. Her E shield is weak before any items. Her Qs and her E are dashes that need to be understood. They are her ins and outs. For instance if Riven goes all in, she will deal damage but will get too much agro from creeps as well as return damage from enemy and since Riven used her dashes, she is free to be harassed for the next 10 seconds. Therefore, Riven needs to constantly do short trades and do small amount of damage, with half of her kit being All in and half her kit being used to escape with the least damage taken. This is also a variable in every matchup, when Riven is playing vs range harass champ she usually after the game has medium or lowest damage dealt according to graph and early she is down 15 20 cs. Why? Because in early game since enemy harasses her for cs, she can't even trade, therefore Riven starts to deal damage usually out of lanning phase but even that is questionable since most of Rivens split and continue to not deal damage until enemy comes to fight her. Up until then she doesn't deal damage since she can't pick trading over csing.\n\n* She is very much killable, despite her having 40% cooldowns mid to late game, if Riven doesn't wait the last second before her Qs expire to Q again in order to reset them over and over, she will not have abilities in a 3,4 seconds period. For instance, if she Fast Qs into enemy, she will not have her Q for that period, but if she harasses from time to time with her Q she will always have her Q due to 40% cdr, but she will not deal damage close enough to when she goes for Fast Q combo.\n\n* Lethality doesn't work on her at least for now, but not due to items being hard nerfed but because everyone feels tanky for lethality to work. Therefore she usually rushes Essence R. with gives her Cd, damage and reduces her cooldowns when she activates her ult. But the risk is huge, because it is a greedy build and she is very squishy and fairly easy to be dealt with.\n\n* Lower elo doesn't know how to deal with Riven and usually when you see a Riven doing well in low elo, she is smurfing. Still, lower divisions don't know how Riven works nor how to deal with her which is why these kind of posts are made usually by lower elo players. Nobody in higher elo is complaining about Riven nor posts on lol boards, so don't bring up higher elos if you aren't high elo. I have yet to see a high division master/challenger player complains about Riven.\n\n* You mention there are 5 Riven mains in 100 challenger? Yeah one tricks that only play Riven. What about Kaisa mains in challenger, or Kassadin mains, Irelia,Jax Mains? This is another absurd information and pointless one to be added from OP. You forget Kha zix mains that constantly climb with that champion, Rengar as well, or any other. If you open OPGG to see leader you won't see many players that got 1000 games with Riven and their second champ is 10 Irelia, but you will see players that abuse constantly 2,3 same champions that are broken. Riven players play only Riven in any situation even when they dont have the upper hand and when they are countered, while there are players that constantly swap between Jax,Irelia,Akali to gain an upper hand (since we talk about toplane) . Same goes for ADCs where they abuse Lucian,Kaisa and now Vayne to get an upper hand over their enemy.\n\nI urge anyone that is complaining about Riven to post their OPGGs to show their rank and confirm my statement where only lower elo players complain about Riven. You will see i guarantee that a huge majority is bellow Plat (gold,silver, even some plats). Don't get annoyed with my comment because it is a fact, and if you think you can win this argument prove my statement wrong.\n\nFinally to add, you talk about you and your friends playing Riven and getting on a win streak, like its a miracle for you (maybe it is idk) but i can pick any champion for toplane and still be on a win streak and climb as well as anyone else. Why? Because as i already said people don't know how to deal with Riven, and you stating that you were gold, confirmed my statement. i've seen players playing Kled and skipping divisions, abusing Sion and skipping divisions, Camille etc. Doesn't matter how hard Riven is to master, unless you are dumb you can understand how her abilities work in game to make her to some degree work in low elo and win games. But you will not win against a good player every nor you can win a single game in high elo like that. Because you didn't master her. Your basic knowledge on any champ can get you out of low elo. \n\nend.","replies":[{"poster":"kingDeDeDarius","date":"2019-01-17T17:52:36.153+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=inFamous Zion,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=y8ktKBsw,comment-id=0019,timestamp=2019-01-17T13:30:40.061+0000)\n>\n> What people that don&#x27;t play Riven or know her need to understand:\n> \n> * Mastering Riven to the point where climbing is fairly easy (up until Master) takes thousands of games.

Riven players play only Riven in any situation even when they dont have the upper hand and when they are countered, while there are players that constantly swap between Jax,Irelia,Akali to gain an upper hand (since we talk about toplane) . Same goes for ADCs where they abuse Lucian,Kaisa and now Vayne to get an upper hand over their enemy.\n> \n> I urge anyone that is complaining about Riven to post their OPGGs to show their rank and confirm my statement where only lower elo players complain about Riven. You will see i guarantee that a huge majority is bellow Plat (gold,silver, even some plats). Don&#x27;t get annoyed with my comment because it is a fact, and if you think you can win this argument prove my statement wrong.\n> \n> Finally to add, you talk about you and your friends playing Riven and getting on a win streak, like its a miracle for you (maybe it is idk) but i can pick any champion for toplane and still be on a win streak and climb as well as anyone else. Why? Because as i already said people don&#x27;t know how to deal with Riven, and you stating that you were gold, confirmed my statement. i&#x27;ve seen players playing Kled and skipping divisions, abusing Sion and skipping divisions, Camille etc. Doesn&#x27;t matter how hard Riven is to master, unless you are dumb you can understand how her abilities work in game to make her to some degree work in low elo and win games. But you will not win against a good player every nor you can win a single game in high elo like that. Because you didn&#x27;t master her. Your basic knowledge on any champ can get you out of low elo. \n> \n> end.\n\nRivens CDs aren't long at all ..if anything they start out medium and become very short with Max CD reduction....like my boy darius start with q and e about the same CD time as rivens abilities, yet he is much more telegraphed, no mobility, no shield, and his e starts at nearly 30 secs LMFAO, so don't even talk as though riven doesn't have it good with her CDs.

Ghost/Flash on Darius is terrifying to see and if Darius knows what he is doing and how to cancel Rivens damage, he can have a free lane. Also, forgot to say that positioning is important when his E is down. \n\nYou just commented what her abilities are. That isn't an argument. She is in League since Season 3 and after her release she was hard nerfed. Ever since she was an off meta pick. Now, since i already said that usually lower divisions complain about Riven, can you tell me yours to clarify this? To prove my statement of course.

Not to mention we have the tools to force those extended trades. We also actually have sustain in our kit and are a large teamfighting threat. Don't act like we don't have strengths alongside our weaknesses, _nor the tools to negate those weaknesses_. Other Darius players' complaining Riven gets to build full AD like we _don't_ have several movespeed options in items, the vast majority of which are tied to those tank items we like.\n\nIf we're gonna be listing weaknesses? Ok. Riven's a **sustainless squishy with shit-tier hp regen** whose early cooldowns are long, contrary to what you think. Her Q W and E at rank 1 are 13, 11, and 10 respectively (Darius Q W an E are 9, 7, and 24 by the way). Out of those, Q doesn't actually scale down with rank whatsoever so before CDR her most important ability actually is the highest CD by a good margin. It's _also_ the first ability she maxes in any matchup not named Pantheon (E max is required to survive one with more than half of a braincell), so those other two are staying high for a while too.\n\nAnd before you bring up W and E getting lower with CDR: They max out at 7 and 6 respectively. Darius' Q and W both drop to 5. _Even lower than hers_. Darius' E CD is high because he would be broken if it had a similar CD to his Q or W, _especially_ in the laning phase, don't even try to tell me otherwise.\n\nHer cooldowns **feel** short because dashes let her have more freedom to choose when to engage and disengage (if she uses them right. If she uses them poorly she's in for a very bad time), so a smart Riven actually tries to play around them. Play a few games of her vs competent toplaners and tell me how short those cooldowns _really_ feel then.\n\n_Just because her kit counters ours doesn't make her OP._ You don't hear the Shen, Nautilus, or Malphite players bitching about us on Darius because they know what they're getting in to.\n\nSick of other Darius players giving us a bad name with this attitude. Learn the matchup or just ban her since _good ones_ counter us. Still regularly stomp the mediocre ones.","replies":[{"poster":"Sir Fabi Of The","date":"2019-01-17T21:47:19.331+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"I literally only logged in to tell you how right you are.\nVery good read and explanation, 9.5/10.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"5050BS","date":"2019-01-17T21:53:58.446+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"All I know is that I play three champs top and I have learned to win vs her.
