I have had toxic history but I&#039;m reformed, and I&#039;m asking you (riot) to look back at that game history and see for yourself that it was indeed harmless banter rather than toxicity. I would even be fine with permanent mute rather than taking 3 1/2 years and $400+ away from me.

I don&#039;t understand how when I&#039;m being toxic towards myself (calling myself garbage) and my friend is considered a ban-able offense, but even at the end of the logs where I was being SO &quot;toxic&quot; I had been telling the enemy teams Orianna that she was doing really good, boosting her morale. \r\nI plan on sending a ticket to riot after this, but I figured it might create a good discussion.

Some people seem to think that the rules don't apply in customs when in fact they do.

Many Rioters love Dunkey's content, and I've unloaded my share of \"Not even close babyyyyy\" jokes around the office; however, we really can't show favoritism to someone just because they are a pro or a known content creator. This isn't really a debate about whether trashtalking is OK or not OK in games; we've talked a lot in the past about how we're OK with players bantering with their friends but you should be careful when interacting with strangers who may not understand your intentions--especially if you're using hate speech or slurs. We have a zero tolerance policy against hate speech, racism, homophobia, and sexism and that policy stands whether you're a random player, a pro player, or a Youtube celebrity.\n\n>This also really wasn't a case about intentional feeders and whether it's OK to be toxic towards other toxic players--there wasn't even a Malphite in the game that got him banned and either way, retaliation just isn't OK because it makes the experience worse for everyone else in the game.\n\n>We know that players have been asking us to be more aggressive against intentional feeders for awhile, and it has taken us a bit longer than we'd like. We do consider gameplay toxicity just as serious as verbal toxicity, and are launching a new Intentional Feeder Detection system in 5.18 that can ban feeders within 15 minutes of matches. We're starting with conservative settings to make sure the system would not ban players for having the rare bad game, even if it was a 0-10 type of bad game but this is a great first step to aggressively tackling intentional feeders.\n\n>At the end of the day, this incident sucks for everyone.

If you reported them and they have a history of acting up like that then they will be punished. From [Understanding the Tribunal](http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=2726400): \n\n>**4) That player in my game was far worse than me. Why am I banned???**\na) I'll keep this one simple: retaliation isn't OK. Reacting to a toxic player by being toxic just incites that player to be even worse--it also ruins the game for up to 8 other players. It is far, far worse to watch two people yelling at each other all game than it is to watch 1 player ranting into blank space. Almost everyone in the game can find someone out there that behaves worse than they do--but so what? Finding someone worse doesn't justify your behavior or justify retaliation. We expect more out of our players. What players often don't realize is... those other players in your game that you thought were worse? Nearly 100% of the time, those players were banned even before you were. If someone is being toxic, just report them and move on. If you retaliate, both of you will be banned. It's really that simple.\n\nAs for you, you admit that you have a history of consistently behaving poorly in-game, and this most recent game of yours was just the straw that broke the camels back in your particular case. Because punishments follow a 4-step program (10-game chat restriction, 25-game CR, 2-week ban, permanent ban), the fact that you got a permaban means that you were already on the 2-week ban stage, got punished again and received the next punishment step in line, which in this case was a permanent ban.\n\nAlso, the reason as to why permamutes aren't a thing is because Riot tried that before with never ending chat restrictions and found out that most people with these would just switch to gameplay trolling instead. Because of this, permamutes don't happen anymore.","replies":[{"poster":"CHAMPlONSHlP ZED","date":"2016-10-06T02:15:32.235+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Well, sorry to say it, but I think that's bullshit.

As for your question, while it definitely is possible to drop down the punishment tiers with consistently good (read: neutral or positive) behavior, extremely negative behavior can cause one to skip over the chat restrictions and straight into a 2-week ban or a permaban. From the [Instant Feedback System FAQ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207489286#h1q2): \n\n>**PUNISHMENTS GENERALLY FOLLOW A BASIC ESCALATION PATH:**\n\n>* First Offense: 10 Game Chat Restriction\n* Second Offense: 25 Game Chat Restriction\n* Third Offense: Two Week Suspension\n* Fourth Offense: Permanent Suspension\n\n>However, it is possible to skip to a Two Week or Permanent suspension based on the severity of the behavior in the game. Excessive negative behavior can result in a Two-Week or Permanent suspension at any time without having a chat restriction on the account.\n\n>**BUT WHAT IF I REFORM? IS IT POSSIBLE TO GO DOWN THE ESCALATION PATH?**\nYes! Players who show consistent reform or show positive behavior in their games will help heal their accounts reputation.\n\n\n>**WHY DID I SKIP RESTRICTIONS?**\nWe have a zero-tolerance policy for extreme negative behavior as well as extremely offensive language and remarks made in game towards other players. Since it is a severe disregard for the Summoner’s Code this sort of behavior can result in skipping to a Two week or Permanent suspension. Suspensions of this degree based on negative behavior will not likely be reduced or removed.\n\nIf you want more information then I would suggest reading the Support articles on behavior and if need be file a Support Ticket asking about it.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"CHAMPlONSHlP ZED","date":"2016-10-06T00:48:44.460+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I was harassing all of the others?

I already apologized for saying it in the chat, I have already admitted to it being a stupid mistake. I hate how this is turned on me like I'm the bad guy. When Riot Tantram said I was harrassing \"all of the others\" I honestly don't know wtf he is talking about. You know what, how do I post all of the logs? You guys can see for yourselves.","replies":[{"poster":"Mig89","date":"2016-10-06T13:15:31.635+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"post the chat logs and itll tell us everything we need to know.

If I really was in the .006% of league summoners toxic enough to be perma banned, don't you think it would have happened years ago?
