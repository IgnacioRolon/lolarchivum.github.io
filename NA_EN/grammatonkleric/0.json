I know others can do it but in the games I&#039;ve played most others (Yi, WW, Kayle) usually fail, while Shyv might carry half because she is so OP with that item. I&#039;m not suggesting the item needs a fix. I think it&#039;s fine as it is and you can&#039;t fix the AFK farm mentality but it&#039;s getting to the point where I dread seeing a jungler that I know is going for sated, or I&#039;ll forgo whatever I really feel like playing and just jungle myself.","replies":[{"poster":"Zyorhist","date":"2015-07-28T17:53:51.867+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sated junglers get beat out hands down by gank junglers.

We are all saying by 20 minutes in a competent gank heavy jungle would have tower dove you resulting in a kill and an objective; dragon if mid or bot, tower if top. \n\nDo that 4/5 times which is a reserved number of ganks to occur by 20 minutes, and objective gold alone would have made the lead almost insurmountable.
