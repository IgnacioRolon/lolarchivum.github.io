Both of them stole my buffs at lvl 1. They&#039;ve been playing together for a while now trolling in ranked games. Judging by their match history they&#039;re most likely boosters. Both of them chose champions that can somehow troll their teammates by blocking them off or stopping their recalls. They use smite to make their own jungler useless. If anyone knows why they use this sort of strategy please let me know... people reported them many times but nothing seemed to happen yet.  If they get banned that will be great since they&#039;re ruining the league of legends experience for many players. If somehow you can review my replay then you&#039;d be able to see exactly what they do.  Judging by leagues report system they wouldn&#039;t get banned unless an actual riot employee sees this.","replies":[{"poster":"TheEvilQueen135","date":"2018-08-20T00:33:28.146+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"no naming and shaming allowed on the boards man.","replies":[{"poster":"MrRashidzBT","date":"2018-08-20T00:35:27.248+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"how would they get banned then","replies":[{"poster":"Ethan Allen","date":"2018-08-20T00:36:31.377+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MrRashidzBT,realm=EUW,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=pAUc9Nay,comment-id=00010001,timestamp=2018-08-20T00:35:27.248+0000)\n>\n> how would they get banned then\n\nBy you sending a support ticket to riot, where it is private","replies":[{"poster":"MrRashidzBT","date":"2018-08-20T00:38:11.605+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"can u send the ticket link please?? i would be happy to delete this post then","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"MrRashidzBT","date":"2018-08-20T00:34:34.472+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"they're boosters though.. still can't name?","replies":[{"poster":"TheEvilQueen135","date":"2018-08-20T00:44:38.515+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MrRashidzBT,realm=EUW,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=pAUc9Nay,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2018-08-20T00:34:34.472+0000)\n>\n> they&#x27;re boosters though.. still can&#x27;t name?\n\nno you can't. you can report in post game or submit a ticket https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"breakordoom444","date":"2018-08-20T05:42:18.098+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=TheEvilQueen135,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=pAUc9Nay,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2018-08-20T00:33:28.146+0000)\n>\n> no naming and shaming allowed on the boards man.\n\nHe does point out the person who is playing the champion, but since there is no direct image, it won't be considered naming and shaming.\n\n(trust me, I did this before)","replies":[{"poster":"TheEvilQueen135","date":"2018-08-20T11:57:38.548+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=breakordoom444,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=pAUc9Nay,comment-id=00010002,timestamp=2018-08-20T05:42:18.098+0000)\n>\n> He does point out the person who is playing the champion, but since there is no direct image, it won&#x27;t be considered naming and shaming.\n> \n> (trust me, I did this before)\nearlier he has the summoner names in the body of the post","replies":[{"poster":"breakordoom444","date":"2018-08-22T13:26:38.396+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=TheEvilQueen135,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=pAUc9Nay,comment-id=000100020000,timestamp=2018-08-20T11:57:38.548+0000)\n>\n> earlier he has the summoner names in the body of the post\n\nI spent almost half an hour figuring this one out haha.\nyour body text didn't load in properly, i was wondering why you quoted me.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"HalcyonDweller","date":"2018-08-20T05:47:50.760+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Submit it in a support ticket, Riot takes this sort of stuff pretty seriously.\n\nYou won't accomplish anything by posting it on the boards.
