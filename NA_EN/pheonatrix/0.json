Any time I see an AP jung or top on the enemy team I pick him whether I'm mid or top and even occasionally if I'm jungle.  I pretty much never lose lane as Galio because his sustain is so insane once he gets catalyst.  I love being able to take an enemy mage's full combo early-mid game (around 1 completed item for everyone) only taking 100-200 damage and use a single Q to chunk them down to half HP.  What I don't understand is why nobody plays him.  He has tank, sustain, cc, damage, super easy last hitting, one of the biggest game changing ults in the game, and he can literally tank a tower forever late game.  As far as I know, he is the only champ in the game that can tank a tower infinitely without some gimmick like thornmail and gunblade with a bunch of enemies hitting you.\n\n\nHere is a jungle game I did well with him in just a few games ago.\nhttp://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/2364429517/209287161?tab=overview\n\nThis is a test I did before they removed the laser on inhib towers.  I was able to tank an inhib tower laser and minions for 54 seconds with this build.  I did not use the ohmwrecker or zhonya actives for thist test.  They were just for the base stats.\n\nhttp://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/2314641046/209287161?tab=stats","replies":[{"poster":"Pheonatrix","date":"2016-12-09T01:21:41.871+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"good for you!
