Anyone else??","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi,\r\n\r\nI'm pretty sure my problems only happened after the patch, but...\r\n\r\nI have three rune pages: AD, JG2 (was Support), and Jungle. Everything was fine with the three pages until I went to modify the Jungle page. It let me clear the page but now it won't let me save anything to it. I was able to modify the Support page and changed the name to JG2 so I wouldn't get confused. I was able to modify runes and save that page. Or so I thought...\r\n\r\nWhen I went into the champ selection page, the rune choices I had were AD, Jungle, Jungle. If I tried to select either of the Jungle, it would just revert to the AD selection. (I'm guessing because the Jungle page is actually empty.) I don't see the JG2 page at all. When I try to modify Jungle, it now changes the page name to JG2, on it's own.\r\n\r\nEverything was working fine before the latest patch. Perhaps just a coincidence. \r\n\r\nI have submitted a ticket, but thought maybe someone else has had this happen and perhaps has an answer.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-04-06T16:46:36.166+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We're looking into a few reports on these duplicate pages.
