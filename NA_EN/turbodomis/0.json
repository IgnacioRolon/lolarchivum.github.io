Ultimately I can't discuss the punishment of other players with you due to privacy, but negativity from them doesn't excuse your own. Fighting fire with fire never works; you should always strive to rise above that. Muting and reporting after the game is the way to go!\n\nIt may benefit you to [**write in to Behavior**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) to discuss the ban more in private there for more context on why you were punished with a 2 week. Can't guarantee that an appeal will lift it, but I can guarantee that they can better discuss the scenario and why the decision was made. In the end, I still hope you take this time to focus on using chat for positivity and strategy. Calling people apes won't help you win, but trying to gather your team and keeping focused on objectives and getting a W will! ^^","replies":[]}]}
