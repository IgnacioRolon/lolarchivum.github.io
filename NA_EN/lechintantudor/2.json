He doesn't have the mana to spam it. \n\nDo you even know what \"interaction\" means in this context?  He's a melee mage/assassin that farms in melee, thus he's super vulnerable to harass.  The only way you don't interact with him, therefore, is if he hides under his tower or you play like a total wimpo.   \n\nAn Ekko who pushes his lane early is a dumb Ekko.  He'll burn his mana too quickly and his only way to harass a ranged mage is E on top of them.  Doing that when he's shoved the lane into your tower means he probably dies.  Ekko wants a frozen lane so he can catch you for an all-in or have his jungle come in for an assist.  \n\nLater on, when he has an item or two and he actually can shove the lane efficiently, he'll go roam, but there aren't many mid champs who should be getting out-pushed by Ekko.","replies":[{"poster":"C10 Rekkles","date":"2018-06-22T18:58:28.613+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":2,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"La Belle Sauvage","date":"2018-06-22T19:47:56.086+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=C10 Gun,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=GfrsrYyL,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2018-06-22T18:58:28.613+0000)\n>\n> 50 Mana rank 1. \n> \n> I guess Faker is dumb too, he literally starts Q and shoves (or at least attempts) the wave.\n\nNo he's not dumb.

That's nothing unique to Ekko.  He can't just lob a q and melt the wave either.  There's plenty of counterplay and room to harass him while he does it.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Dont Blìnk","date":"2018-06-22T18:29:01.141+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Don't worry m8, laning _as_ him sucks even more","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sleepcoma","date":"2018-06-23T06:10:56.550+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you think ekko does this? try playing against a decent tf, he comes to lane and pushes it out just to roam somewhere","replies":[{"poster":"LechintanTudor","date":"2018-06-23T07:21:06.269+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, but at least you can kill TF because he doesn't have a free revive every 110 seconds.","replies":[{"poster":"Sleepcoma","date":"2018-06-23T20:49:26.550+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"are you hearing yourself??? 110 seconds, there is definitely a window of opportunity to fight him. and you cant kill tf... hes always roaming to other lanes","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kurt Hyzan","date":"2018-06-23T21:15:46.031+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ha lol I was going to comment about {{champion:4}} \n\nBoth are extremely annoying to deal with, one has the \"magic gold card making any interaction impossible\", the other one has the \"oh shit\" button in case something goes wrong (I hate laning against {{champion:245}} as much as {{champion:26}} )","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Twitchimus Prime","date":"2018-06-22T14:41:44.239+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"singed does the same thing his e can disengage most trades, his waveclear is ridiculous and wins lane automatically with 3 dark seals which each sell for 245 gold, he loses only 105 for each. well made champ by riot games.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DirigoX","date":"2018-06-22T22:48:31.181+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"as an ekko main lemme tell you there are so many ways to dumpster him in lane.
