Again [GAMEPLAY]","subforum":"Report a Bug","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"**Winter Wonder Lulu Pix Visual Bugs**\n\nI have recently played a game with Winter Wonder Lulu, and I noticed a few visual bugs. Like before, the sparkly aura around Pix is still the purple of default and contradicts the snowy theme. I made a post about that one bug and received a reply, but it was never fixed. Another issue happened that game, it occurred while I was backing, and made it so that that same aura around pix did not vanish when Pix was transformed into a balloon. \nApologies for not providing video.\n\n* The first bug was always active.\n* The second bug only happened while backing.\n\nIf anyone reads this, thanks! I hope for these issues to be resolved. {{champion:117}} !","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2017-06-13T16:23:19.441+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Command Ethereal - \n\nRegarding the aura, I believe I'd replied to you about that. It's still on the backlog of bugs, so no worries there. I, unfortunately, don't have an ETA on this one, as it is a lower priority than some other issues, but I can comment out on the bug to remind the dev that it's on their plate. :) \n\nI can look at the other issue you're describing today and update the existing ticket that I'd made for the first issue!","replies":[{"poster":"Fairyfleur","date":"2017-06-13T17:58:01.683+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks! I just assumed that it would've been fixed by now, but I've never sent any other bugs so I didn't know what to expect.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2017-06-13T18:46:05.091+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, ofc! \n\nGood news for you - this'll be fixed in 7.13! One of our lovely VFX artists, Walker, had a bit of time on his plate after cranking out a ton of VFX for the versus skins. :)\n\nFor a bit of context, we prioritize gameplay issues over anything else, and in this case, the particle wasn't horribly egregious (i.e. it wasn't a Blood Moon particle), which is why it took a back seat to some of the other bugs we resolve more quickly. That said, we do try to fix as many issues as we can per patch, but we do need to prioritize the new content coming up, so we can keep things fresh, too!","replies":[{"poster":"Flemman","date":"2017-06-14T08:34:47.006+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"on that note of gameplay issue, isn't the hud syndra ult the same as the rakan one fixed in this patch?\nSeems like it's at least a one year bug that affect the gameplay a lot.\nCan we hope that it will be fixed soon now that, the rakan one was done (probably same coding error)","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
