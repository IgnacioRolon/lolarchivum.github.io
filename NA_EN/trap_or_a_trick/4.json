No doubt this is going to make Veigar {{champion:45}} alot stronger, However I don't think this will break him (At least not right away). Sure He'll be able to Rain down Projectiles that deal Precisely [100 / 150 / 200 / 250 / 300] (+ 100% AP), but he does have Mana costs. Currently, those Mana costs are as follows [60 / 65 / 70 / 75 / 80]. Assuming Veigar does not opt into buying Tear of the Goddess {{item:3070}} (which would give him a much larger Mana Pool & Mana Refunds), Veigar could drain his entire pool before he knows it. Now if they do decide they want him to have this, but it ends up being really strong to the point he needs a nerf, they are going to do one or two things;\n1.  Increase Mana Costs\n2.
