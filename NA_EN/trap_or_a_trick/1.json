They would be toxic up to a point, and when the report card shows that they are close to punishment, they would back off on toxicity for the sole purpose of avoiding punishment.  And when the report card comes back clean they would resume toxicity, because they know they are no longer in danger of punishment.","replies":[{"poster":"Azadethe","date":"2017-11-28T17:42:52.321+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"The problem is, it literally takes 3 months to drop 1 punishment tier, so if someone is on the \"verge\" of punishment, they'll be there for 3 months. it's not like they can behave for 2 days and then \"let loose.\"\n\nAnd, back in the real world: People aren't generally deliberately toxic. They are toxic as a reaction to other toxic behavior far more often. When you're the only person on your team 5/0 while everyone else fed both 0/6 and their turrets, you're darn tootin' the 5/0 is going to react to 4 people going 0/6, Especially if they watch those fights from across the map, and just see a Vayne go up , walk into the opponent, and stand in 1 spot auto attacking. Or watch a Orianna push Zoe to turret 6 times in a row, only to have that Orianna ganked by Udyr 6 times in a row, giving the Zoe 6 free kills Your 5/0 Jungler's also going to get pretty mad when a team is pinged 1:30 in advance of an infernal drake spawn, and literally no one goes, no one even wards, or they commit suicide to a brawl 15 seconds before the spawn. Or what about the Support Nami who's timing every objective, is carrying 3/0/10, pings everything out, verbally telling team in type, and calling skills gets literally ignored on every single call in a 40 minute game, and you lose because your team just doesn't care about objectives?\n\n\nThese rages aren't the result of intentionally wanting to be toxic. They are the result of legitimate responses to teams throwing a game every way they possibly can, not caring that they are, or actual inting (How do 3 lanes feed 24 kills by level 7 when Evelynn went 5/0 ganking them before 6? I've had it happen!). They aren't planned or something someone can just look at a report card and say \"I need to  tone it down and prevent from occuring.\" They may try.
