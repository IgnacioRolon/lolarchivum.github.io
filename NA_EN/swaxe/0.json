My question involve the \"Play as, with or against\" part. If I am not playing Kayn but I have one one my team and another on the enemy team, and both are going Darkin. Will I get 2 points of the progress for that mission, or will I only get one? Same thing with one darkin, one assassin and 2 assassins.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-07-13T20:12:24.339+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The missions is counting per game, so it will have to be individual matches.

Was hoping it was counting several in one game because I wont be able to play. Will still try though, cause they are good pics. Good work!","replies":[]}]}]}
