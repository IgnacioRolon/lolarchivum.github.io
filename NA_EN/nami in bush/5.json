I don't want to go through weeks of conflict in a support ticket and lose my account because of cheating that I did not do.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-31T15:33:39.572+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"False positives are pretty rare in my experience, but if you're that worried, you may want to look at other VOIPs such as Discord, Teamspeak or Mumble.","replies":[{"poster":"Nami in Bush","date":"2016-08-31T18:47:39.359+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Targons Blade,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=xgBM6E8O,comment-id=000100000000,timestamp=2016-08-31T15:33:39.572+0000)\n>\n> False positives are pretty rare in my experience, but if you&#x27;re that worried, you may want to look at other VOIPs such as Discord, Teamspeak or Mumble.\n\nThat's what I usually use.\n\nWith false-positives, what are the chances of getting a ban repealed? If it truly is a false-positive. I'm really just getting paranoid because of all the time I've had on this account, and the content on the account, I wouln't want it banned for something stupid like a false-positive ban for cheating.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-01T15:30:34.048+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fale positives are so rare, I've never seen one personally, so I'm very confident one is not likely to happen.

The only 3rd party software I know that gives an in-game overlay is curse voice. I read on an archived post that Riot was working with Curse to ensure this wouldn't happen, which was in 2014. Also, Curse is not clearly outlined as a malicious 3rd party software.
