I can&#039;t say how impactful which side it spawns on will be, but I can say its yet another unnecessary addition of something I thought league wanted to avoid because its an element that you cannot plan around. And it really goes to the same problem the elemental dragons presented. If you go nunu/shyv/warwick into a game where the first dragon is one that synergizes with your team, you got an RNG advantage. \r\n\r\nNow this dumb crab is going to RNG decide which side of the map the jungle should be playing around during the period normally a first gank would occur, and both sides will know where it is. This means if you happen to have a stronger side on the map due to champ picks you COULD NOT HAVE PLANNED FOR, you have an advantage. \r\n\r\nTo give an example, lets say the two mid laners are about even in pressure early game, but your bot is cait braum against some scaling play back bot laners, but your top is a nasus vs riven. Who the scuttler goes to will basically be decided by a coin flip, because one of those two lanes will not support a fight.\r\n\r\nAs I said in a previous post about the dragons, the RNG elements they&#039;re adding aren&#039;t anything major YET, but the direction is just negligent. Who actually wants this kind of stuff in the main game mode that is suppose to be competitive? You shouldn&#039;t be giving advantages of any kind based off RNG, crits kind of still around and tolerated because its just been here, but why add more? Do shit like this in seperate game modes that aren&#039;t considered competitive, and make them like mario party fun games for all I care. I don&#039;t want to see any advantage in my games be determined by a coin flip.","replies":[{"poster":"TS Media","date":"2018-04-29T03:29:51.961+0000","up_votes":51,"down_votes":2,"body":"It feels that way because the people who imposed those rules in the first place are no longer in charge.

And i'm glad that i gave up playing. I have been literally spending 26 hours consecutively playing League of Legends last summer, things were not perfect, not even near good, but it's been tremendously better than now. New level system, new runes, new this, new that. \nSeriously, i don't know who comes up with OP, unnecessary and rather stupid things like these in season 8.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Teridax68","date":"2018-04-29T16:46:25.223+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Indeed, it does feel like Riot's perception of RNG has shifted over time, and so likely because it's now being seen as this diversity generator in a game that has long suffered from stagnancy. However, I don't think randomness is the way to go, and I feel relying on it to create variation in games only further ignores the real problem, which is that the metagame in League is incredibly restrictive and repetitive. Looking at this change, I'm even less convinced that Riot will meaningfully change bot lane in the future, because the core intent of the bot lane changes is to introduce diversity to team compositions. I don't really see confidence in the ability for this to radically change the meta when we're also being given more random jungle objectives, as well as a new Ranked model next season that fundamentally relies on a rigid 1-1-1-2 team setup. I hope to be wrong, but if the bot lane changes really do revolutionize team comps, I don't really see the need to force diversity through a jungle change that seems both more RNG-dependent and more snowbally.\n\nTo me, I think RNG is useful only in games that lack the systems to generate rich and complex gameplay on their own. In pen-and-paper RPGs like DnD, random dice rolls are perfect, because pretty much all the variables are otherwise known to the players and can be easily processed, so if the game were perfectly deterministic, it would become entirely predictable and lacking in variety. In card games, randomness is necessary for many of the same reasons: if there were a non-random algorithm to everything, one could perfectly predict every outcome and exploit that knowledge, which would cause most card games to fall flat. \n\nHowever, these games are extremely simple, using a very basic medium and, at best, the power of human processing in order to generate gameplay. By contrast, a video game like League is vastly complex: there are a lot of known variables and systems, but it's generally impossible to process them all perfectly in real-time, and on top of that, the existence of an opposing team of players means there's no real way of knowing what they're going to do either. There is a vast number of actions and decisions one can take at any given moment, so if games are so repetitive and predictable as to become boring, then that is a problem with the game presenting too few valid options, rather than one of the game needing randomness.\n\nAt the end of the day, RNG works purely to generate a certain set of outcomes, so whatever can be created then, can usually be done better by a system designed by people who properly understand what the most interesting outcomes are, and who push for those, rather than the many negative outcomes that tend to come out of a random system. Because of this, I'd rather Riot asked themselves what exactly is the gameplay they're trying to create with this kind of randomness, and find a non-random way to achieve it, instead of having more randomness in League just for randomness's sake.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Marothennan","date":"2018-04-29T09:42:38.876+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"Some people get stupid with age, looks like it happens to some companies too","replies":[{"poster":"kargish","date":"2018-04-29T16:19:11.672+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Possibly because it's not the same people that runs said company anymore","replies":[{"poster":"Marothennan","date":"2018-04-29T16:23:58.422+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah that's why I said some companies.

I went straight from my blue to his red, then raptors, then cleared the rest of my jungle while he tried desperately to find a camp that was still up. I was level 5 when he was level 3, invaded his bot side (obviously where he would end up) and killed him, He's now 3 and I'm 6. Clear up his wolves before getting bot lane colapse on me with a tp from top so ult the midlaner, get a kill and walk straight to his raptors, then onto mine.\n\nA good jungler will learn to invade when being invaded, mitigate their own loses while maximising on their opportunities. Pathing, warding, and  map awareness are all massive parts of being a jungler, and I don't see these changes making any difference to this.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"YuGiHo","date":"2018-04-29T15:35:38.452+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":4,"body":"its not even that rng, its a basic coin flip and it will alert every one in the game what side it will spawn on well before it spawns.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Anatera","date":"2018-04-29T10:15:46.223+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Don't feel too bad.
