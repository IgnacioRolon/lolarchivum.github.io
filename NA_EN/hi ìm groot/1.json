If you find a way to get ahead in the early game, it feels just like it did before. You can get the items you need to deal dmg and it feels like you&#039;re in a good position to carry, even if someone on the enemy team did just as well. However if you fell behind in lane, it feels like you as ADC become largely irrelevant to the game short of getting a large gold spike from maybe a lucky cleanup. Any kind of play for late game strat feels impracticle. If both ADC&#039;s go even, games will usually be decided by a different lane because then BOTH adc&#039;s are largely irrelevant. Have had very few games go long enough for ADC&#039;s to get the kind of items necessary to hyper carry without being fed. Makes the role kind of awkward, especially since whether or not you get ahead has very little to do with you. You&#039;re typically the weakest person on that side of the map early, even with jg nerfs jg is usually stronger.\r\n\r\nThis is kinda shitty because adc&#039;s were never actually that strong this season, enchanter supports were and they made adc&#039;s look strong. But they nerfed the enchanter supports around the same time as crit... all to force pyke to be a non-troll pick in the role they&#039;d intended him for. \r\n\r\nMost of the changes that would be needed to make bot lane feel like it did before though would be general lowering damage across the board. Make it so someone needs to be fed to one shot an adc again, assassin or not. Otherwise eventually marksman will become the troll picks and everyones just going to go bruisers, because how useful is a glass cannon that CAN do damage, if he&#039;s guaranteed to be dead at the start of a teamfight? Also if games were to go longer again it would give adc&#039;s the opportunity to farm up to scale like they use to be able to do. Now, depending on the rest of your team comp, if you try to hug a side lane until you&#039;ve caught up in gold from lane phase, the enemy team as 5 will probably get enough objectives in that time to secure themselves the win.","replies":[{"poster":"Ahris","date":"2018-06-23T18:59:34.056+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/8t776a/dopas_thoughts_on_current_meta/\n\nDOPA'S thought for current meta:\n\n\"The reason why current patch feels so sloppy is because ADC's are not popping out all the time and we are seeing double brusier compositions.

I personally never want to see bruisers bot lane, I just gave it as an example of people's solutions to the issue with how easy to is to kill a regular adc. But I think ADC's got falsely targeted as being \"strong\" after the supports got buffed. But they because riot wanted pyke to be a viable support even though he was so different from the strong supports, they hit both the supports and ADC's at the same time. End's up with the role feeling like most games you never actually hit a power spike, or it didn't come in time to really say you carried. The vast majority of my games this season, the adc did not decide the outcome of the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Akaviri","date":"2018-06-24T16:17:08.027+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, I read this too. Dopa has said before that supports were the strongest and most impactful role in the game (while ADCs only came in 3rd). Now, he says here that ADCs were too OP before the patch. That's true, if you look at bot lane as one unit, support + ADC. ADCs were in fact overpowered mostly due to the increased strength of support.\n\nHis analysis here is mostly results based, in that nerfing either support(the actual supports, not stuff like Brand) or ADC hurts both roles because of their interdependence, which in turn reduces the power of bot lane. So ADC nerfs also hurt supports and bot lane strength, so did the nerfs to enchanters. \n\nThe biggest misconception that isn't really being conveyed by what Dopa says though is that ADC is worse to play now. It's really not. If you've been listening to Dopa, you remember that before this midseason patch he listed ADCs as 3rd in terms of most impactful roles. Because as strong as ADCs were damage wise at the time, they were still dependent on their team to set them up. One other Master/Challenger Redditor mentioned that during the era of ardent supports, many ADC mains in master tier didn't have the movement skills of an actual master tier ADC main. So my point is, this patch might actually have served to weed out the less skilled ADC players that were higher rank than they deserved.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"NowThatWereDead","date":"2018-06-24T05:20:25.037+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have been playing lots of adc lately again also as draven and he seems to be working well with me but just a reminder im only silver 3 so that might be why","replies":[]},{"poster":"Malak","date":"2018-06-24T02:21:07.636+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That’s league.

Short of the jg and mid snowballing, and them just camping ur lane and forcing u to lose, you probably could have done SOMETHING to be impactfull. ADC's not strong enough early to ensure their early game like that, your early game has alot more to do with the situation than a top laners.

I don't really agree with the idea that it was just supports that made them so strong before though. If I was squishy at all a lot of crit carries only had to hit me twice and that happened in less that a second with no abilities or chance to miss involved a lot of the time. I do absolutely agree that damage in general needs a nerf pass. Crit carries relative power, especially with certain comps and support items, meant a lot of things had to be balanced around that and since Riot have generally tried to keep tanks/juggernauts in line that meant power creep. My first statement was really about how a lot of ADC mains are just upset that they have to think about more than which target is squishiest or just expect the meat/ shield wall to let them just stand in one spot like a mini Mundo with a permanent Kayle E. Most are not those people, but I don't mind seeing the ones that got carried in ways they don't understand get cracked.","replies":[{"poster":"hi ìm groot","date":"2018-06-23T20:18:43.260+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=blindasleep,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=YEqaANnc,comment-id=000100000000,timestamp=2018-06-23T19:13:28.293+0000)\n>\n> I didn&#x27;t mean it as an insult to you or anything like that.

Like I said I'm not an adc main, my most comfortable role is jungle, but I play all roles. The purpose was just to express how it seems to adc's paths to actually carrying have narrowed. And honestly, I think this is an under talked about factor, at least for a role in general. Kind of like how hashinshin's crusade was for top lane that ACTUALLY did get great results for bruisers. I think adc's are having the same problem, but alot of the serious adc's solve it by duo q'ing with a support. But idk that I'd agree that balancing this role around them being this super weak and vulnerable champion that CAN pop off if propped up is a fair thing to solo q'ers when compared to any other role.","replies":[{"poster":"blindasleep","date":"2018-06-24T03:46:44.164+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=hi ìm groot,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=YEqaANnc,comment-id=0001000000000000,timestamp=2018-06-23T20:18:43.260+0000)\n>\n> Well my post wasn&#x27;t meant as a bitch post about the state of adc.

I try to learn and keep up on other rolls and I've been playing a long time. I like that ADC got a nerf in that it's an opportunity to rebalance other problematic things that couldn't be before because of the relative power it would add to ADCs. I very much enjoy the idea of seeing more variance in the bot lane. Especially since it opens up other lanes too. The game was balanced too much around the duo lanes that Riot seemed to be enforcing for a while. I'm sure they will give the champs that got hard nerfed some love, I just hope they get everything else to a better baseline to measure against first or at least just small tweaks that can be more easily untweaked once they get things settled down a bit. Mostly just want the best strategy to be the best strategy in the given game instead of just the best strategy in every game no matter what you're looking at.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Elkington VI","date":"2018-06-24T01:45:55.926+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"You'd think SR players would be complaining less since ranged carries aren't mandatory in every team comp like usual.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rabid Husky","date":"2018-06-23T22:58:22.989+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"in all honesty I think one of the bigger problems for the role is the lack of item diversity for adcs, we got one new item (two technically including ie)and everything else got price increases, when your best items are all expensive as shit, yeah non crit focused carries like ez,lucian, kaisa, will rise up since they don't need fifty thousand gold for one item, and its even better for people like draven and mf who just build stormrazors and then go full lethality or raw damage stats. there isn't any alternate build paths for adcs, its build the expensive as hell crit items or build raw ad or lethality that are much cheaper, they don't have any other items to help keep you in the game if the enemy keeps you down YOU ARE DOWN pass no go donzo farm and pray they don't send anyone after you, atleast if a tank goes 0-5 they can still be a tank, a mage or assassin goes 0-5 they can build into items, a adc goes 0-5 just afk","replies":[]},{"poster":"ISLAMICWARRIOR99","date":"2018-06-23T20:39:25.386+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Honestly unless youre a 1 trick theres no reason to play adc.

I find the 3 meta marksmen ezreal/kaisa/lucian all have two things in common. That their mid game is exceptional, and they don't build crit. 3 items on these guys and it's nuts.

Also look at the anti synergy of double zeal items with ie. You get 120% crit and that's 20% crit you don't get to use and since 1% crit = 60g that's 1200 gold not being used.
