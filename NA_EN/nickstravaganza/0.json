There are a bunch of theories that try to explain this. One such theory is that as teeth became less necessary for survival they lost \"priority\" over other features in the head, most notably the brain. [Here](http://www.manticmoo.com/articles/jeff/scholarly/an-evolving-human-dentition.php)'s a short article on the subject.\n\nYordles aren't humans, of course, but looking at Gnar, Yordles seem to have undergone an evolution process at least vaguely similar to that of humans. If we assume they also slowly gained larger brains as time went by (which seems likely; present day Yordles are far less animalistic than Gnar and are capable of advanced level science, i.e. Heimerdinger), we can also assume their jaw (and by proxy the amount of room for large teeth) became smaller. Tusks that large would take up a lot of room, causing misaligned/crooked teeth and possibly discomfort/pain/tendencies for things to become lodged between the teeth and cause tooth decay/infections/risk of earlier death.\n\nAs Yordles became smarter they also became better able to cook and use instruments to help them with things their teeth had to do for them before. They'd also become better able to use weapons. The need for giant tusks would decrease pretty dramatically, and any Yordles born with a genetic mutation that cost them their tusks would still be able to survive. If they had bigger brains, they may even have been better at survival by using wits, and then natural selection would take its course.\n\nBy now I assume they are scientific enough for proper dental care, but the tusks are long gone.\n\n(Also, he looks cuter with those tusks, okay.)","replies":[]},{"poster":"nickstravaganza","date":"2014-08-05T18:40:16.621+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just the natural course of evolution, I suspect.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"yupster","date":"2014-08-05T18:28:22.475+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":2,"body":"https://31.media.tumblr.com/2a6c18d68082dbae6d6ad2b50b68242f/tumblr_inline_n9hm3vNcfB1rczop7.png\n\nDEMAGLIO!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Riot Draggles","date":"2014-08-05T18:06:10.939+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"Gnar is super adorable!

Overall I feel this dance really captures the spirit of this little rascal.
