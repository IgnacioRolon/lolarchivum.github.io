If he could suddenly apply glacial augment at melee strength from 450 range laning against him would likely become a nightmare - as an example. Or for relic shield specifically, a big part of why it even has the heal is because a melee champion is more than likely going to take harass for moving up to a wave to cs.

You can see this in his armor, his free AP from souls, his bonus damage on his E, everything about his kit is tied to Damnation, which is an extremely powerful ability on its own.\n\nThresh does not need 450 range. That is far less relevant to his identity, I believe, than his identity as a warden, which is tied to items like {{item:3109}} and{{item:3302}} . Why does Thresh need to keep his 450 range?

Support items get buffed or other items get nerfed (free sightstone in this case) the items get abused by other lanes (remember the mana regen work that led to FQC pickups mid) and then get nerfed for supports, leaving the role worse than we started with. \n\nLearn from the past or repeat your mistakes.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Oleandervine","date":"2018-01-12T22:14:30.324+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you remember Twin Shadows? I certainly do. You know what it was? It was the Frost Queen's Claim active on a standalone item. Apparently, so was the active for Talisman of Ascension, long long ago. The thing about these two items is that they were removed because no one picked them, much like {{item:3056}} and {{item:3060}} are right now. Their actives became INFINITELY more engaging once they were added to the support Tier 3 items, and they added something more interesting to the support role other than being warding donkeys.\n\nSo I don't really understand how you think that essentially bringing back these actives on items, when they were already removed from items long ago, is going to fix things. All that will do is make the active items have potential to be heavily abused by other laners. And then there's the fact that you're not bringing Face of the Mountain back AT ALL. (Let's not even start on all the champions, like Taric, who have voice lines that will essentially be deleted because you're removing these items).\n\nIn short, you're going to make the support role a helluva lot more boring. ***A sightstone is not an engaging or satisfying item. It never will be.*** Stop trying to make fetch happen. If you want to reinvent the Sightstone, take a look at some way to work it into the trinket system. Give players who buy a gold income item a special quest that upgrades their trinket into a Sightstone, and let the wards dropped by the trinket Sightstone briefly reveal wards nearby so they can still clear wards. This will allow you to keep the same Tier 3 support items AS THEY ARE, and will just allow you to nix all of the Sightstone items instead. But for the love of all the gods, don't go through with this absurd change. Tier 3 gold items are the most engaging part of supporting, and their quests are satisfying. Your goals over the years have been to make the role more engaging and more interesting, and telling people \"hey, you get free vision! yayayayay! but it's not a trinket! yayayay\" is possibly the most backwards thing to do, and will undo everything you've done to make Support a good position to play. Please reconsider this, and don't saddle us with this new shitty version of the sightstone at the expense of our fun items and quests.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Legacy Hydralpha","date":"2018-01-12T20:39:36.702+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even if you stay with the idea for now, I think you should hold out on it. A number of players seem to hate the idea, and I'm one to them. I've heard that the idea is being considered because supports can function without rushing Sightstone, as present in the Ardent meta. But this was because having Ardent Censer was better than early vision.\n\nThis change would also make support less fun in general, since you don't have the option of rushing for Sightstone, you no longer get a quest reward for using your support item, and in cases where it may be harder to get your quest reward (Relic Shield or Ancient Coin against a hard poke bot) it can feel less fun.\n\nI'm no game developer or balance team member, but I do play the game. Keep playtesting the change and see how people feel about it, and maybe find other ideas on ways to balance out other classes abusing support items or making supports less locked behind Sightstone.

These changes are actually not really more than forcing Supports to buy a nerfed version of {{item:2303}} {{item:2302}} {{item:2301}} instead of leaving them the choice between those and the Actives ( {{item:3401}} {{item:3069}} {{item:3092}} ) combined with {{item:2045}} . Frostfang and Targon's Brace rewards are really satisfactory, Nomad's Medallion's reward is less noticeable but neat for defensive Heal/Shield-Supports, for whom this item is intended for. It's also balanced out by the advantage in Gold Generation Ancient Coin users get. That leads me to the next point: Ancient Coin users will get their \"free Sightstone\" way faster than everyone else, while Frostfang users are even taking risks concerning this, as they may be locked out of gold generation if their laning phase ends early, as they cannot get their Frostfang to proc without any enemy champions or turrets nearby.\n\nAnd the removal of Ruby Sightstone hurts Tank/initiation supports. Alistar, Leona, Blitzcrank, Thresh, Nautilus, Braum etc. will not like the removal of Ruby Sightstone as they rely heavily on Active Items to peel for their carries, as they have few to no heals and shields in their actual kit. Leona, Blitzcrank and Nautilus don't have any shields for their allies, Alistar has his passive that will only proc if an enemy dies in the fight, Thresh only has his Lantern which is a big cooldown, and Braum also has no shield or heal in the sense of casting a spell on your ally and them being able to absorb some damage for some time after. He has his E which blocks projectiles coming from one direction and his W that will give the allied target bonus resistances, but no spells that really *shield* your ally. So the {{item:3401}} Active is nice to have, but the 20% Item CDR you get from {{item:2045}} will also help reduce cooldowns from things like {{item:3190}} {{item:3222}} {{item:3107}} {{item:3800}} etc. See where I'm going with this?","replies":[{"poster":"Spank the Fox","date":"2018-01-12T15:21:14.876+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":3,"body":"supports had only 20% item CDR for two seasons and I’ve yet to see anyone clamouring over ruby sightstone’s passive.

Unless you’re literally using the items as they come off CD, aka fighting all in every minute mid-game, you aren’t going to notice a significant loss and that’s provided you built Ruby mid game (most get it late game when there is nothing elde to buy)\n\nThe amount of gold you can “save” from this change will be more consistent and impactful.
