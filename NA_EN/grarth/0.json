But it can be so extremely annoying for people who don&#039;t like to hear those sounds all the time. I didn&#039;t really care about such behaviour because I could simply mute those players and they could have their fun without me being annoyed. But since quite a while many champions still play their sounds even if i mute those players.\r\nThis really ruins the game experience. Especially on ARAM, where you are near each other all the time it really pisses me off if i have to hear those Heimerdinger or Singed laughs all the time.\r\nBut the absolutely most annoying thing I ever experienced in a game was earlier today, when Star Guardian Lux spammed her recall in ARAM the whole game and I just could not do anything to mute her sound except turn the sound off completely. And that is no option for me because I think its a pretty important element of the game to hear different skills, especially if you can&#039;t see them. I really try to stay calm and prevent people from flaming but if i hear this recall being spammed one more time, then it&#039;s probably me who is flaming like hell. It just drives me crazy. I fell like a game should be as fun as possible for as many players as possible. But sas it is this spamming really can ruin the game experience for some players.\r\n\r\nI don&#039;t know what you changed but please try to find a fix as soon is possible. \r\n\r\nSincerely\r\nGrarth","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-09-18T23:32:17.874+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Hey Grarth,\n\nMuting a player will only mute their VO, not the SFX or the animation of the emote, etc.","replies":[{"poster":"Stray Kat","date":"2015-09-18T23:37:55.571+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is that suggesting that if I mute a Super Galaxy Rumble player I don't have to hear him shouting every time he clicks?

I feel like this is a bug, thats why I posted it here. Or is his laugh in fact no VO?\nThe part about the Lux recall music was more like a suggestion because it really drove me nuts and I feel like the game would be less toxic with a simple way to mute it so that everyone can have their fun (they spamming it and me playing the game without driving nuts^^). The recall sound in general is pretty useful but especially in ARAM it provides no value at all. And for a \"funny\" gimmick it should be that: fun and funny and not annoying as hell without an easy way to mute it.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-09-28T22:55:05.328+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> But how do you explain, that I still can hear for excample the laughing Heimerdinger even though i already muted him?

Once I did that, I was unable to hear him laughing. He did still play the laugh animation, which is intended, as muting only mutes VO, not animations or SFX. \n\n> The part about the Lux recall music was more like a suggestion because it really drove me nuts and I feel like the game would be less toxic with a simple way to mute it so that everyone can have their fun (they spamming it and me playing the game without driving nuts^^).

I'm actually not sure if the system is setup to differentiate recall SFX from SFX in general. If not, we'd need to build out the system. It's certainly something worth discussing, though.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"patmax17","date":"2015-09-19T10:17:30.436+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I tried yesterday in aram (a garen was spamming emotes ALL THE TIME, so annoying) but I could still hear his VO\nI have italian client, if that can help","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kouga","date":"2015-09-19T10:20:05.109+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not to mention that it doesn't mute pings so if they're being a true pain in the ass they just ping constantly all over the place.","replies":[]},{"poster":"disregardable","date":"2015-09-18T14:40:57.930+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They mute laughs and taunts, not VFX/recalls.

Thats what part 1 is about and the 2nd part is about the enabling of recalls in aram, where it does not have any function other than visuals & sounds. So they should add an option to block this as well because it really ruins the game experience.","replies":[]}]}]}
