The problem is I don't get paid to do it anymore. Minions are worth 4 Gold each. Then I help my lane get pushed, and try to go get some money but my team took my camps.. because they still get paid.\r\n\r\nSo unless you're able to get into lanes and secure kills, you're always behind. Always struggling to find more CS, not able to come into lane because the lane opponent has almost twice the income.\r\n\r\nJunglers need to be allowed to farm minions for CS. If Top Lane afks guess what? We have nobody to cover Top because Jungle isn't wasting time @4Gold per minion.","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-08-02T00:40:22.009+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"From the [wiki](https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Hunter's_Machete):\n\n> Killing large or epic monsters grants +50 bonus experience, and gain +50 bonus experience for each level the monster is higher than you. The first large monster killed grants +120 bonus experience. If your gold from minions is greater than half your gold from monsters, lane minion kills will grant 10 less gold. This penalty is removed upon completion of an enchantment on a Skirmisher's Sabre or Stalker's Blade.\n\nIf laners are killing jungle monsters while junglers are killing lane minions, your team is missing out on exp as well as gold. Note that, as a jungler, you only stop getting \"paid\" for minions when you've gotten more gold from minions than you have from camps. You're not penalized until your jungling turns into jungling+laning, which is a key indicator of a funnel strat as Pyrosan mentioned above.","replies":[{"poster":"Tenarin","date":"2019-11-12T09:06:07.216+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sucks though when you have an afk and the jg has to lane.","replies":[{"poster":"Tenarin","date":"2019-11-12T09:06:36.991+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"or maybe they have to sell their jg item idk...sometimes u don't know though and then you lose your early gold and you're screwed (from selling jg item early)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Pyrosan","date":"2019-08-02T00:23:28.809+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's in place to nerf the gold funnel strategy of taric/yi lulu/yi","replies":[]},{"poster":"preternatural","date":"2019-08-02T00:42:03.646+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"this is the state of things because portions of this community have no honor.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tenarin","date":"2019-11-12T09:05:23.795+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I liked it as a way to make up for trash teammates.  I get these morons who let wave after wave crash into their turret, costing my team so much gold...i'm talking INSANE amounts when you have 3 lanes worth of bad players.  As a jg trying to win with the garbage matchmaking system, we were able to grab all the cs these idiots were wasting.  Then again that was always Riot's goals, to completely control everything via matchmaking, and I guess being able to do that to get ahead makes it that much more difficult for them to push everyone toward 50% winrate.  It's not surprising they got rid of it. w/e though I still have my methods :D","replies":[]},{"poster":"AlienPrimate","date":"2019-08-02T00:33:58.396+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You are doing something severely wrong if you can't get cinderhulk before your team starts taking your camps.  It should take 12 minutes at the very longest to complete your jungle item while only getting gold from your own jungle monsters without even getting scuttles.  If you happen to get fed in a clown fiesta it is possible to have a completed jungle item by 5 minutes.  As soon as you complete your jungle item the monster hunter debuff is removed.","replies":[{"poster":"Aletheiacracy","date":"2019-08-02T04:24:42.401+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I use Bloodrazor and play him like a ninja. When his Taunt was updated it focused Attack Speed, and extending Attack Speed by using W, then Ult when W ends, then another W after Ult to maximize the duration of his Attack Speed buff. During W, his Passive is buffed 150%, meaning more damage on hit, when added to Bloodrazor you deal additional damage based on the opponents Max Health and get even more Attack Speed to really get some damage. Eventually, Immolate may become helpful and Sunfire Cape actually provides better stats and a stronger Immolate.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Tormentula","date":"2019-08-02T01:53:15.546+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The reason why its there is because of gold funnel strats.. if you were around when gold funneling was a thing, you'd be singing a different tune. \n\nIts a necessary evil, and the only junglers who will feel this are powerfarming junglers that do have more CS than everybody in the game (which is still rare, only ever see it commonly on karthus and graves), but for tanks and early centric junglers it doesn't impact their early game or their snowball at all.\n\nAs rammus you shouldn't be split pushing, you should be looking for picks or flanks with your team nearby since you have the most reliable taunt in the whole game, split pushing as a jungler isn't typically ideal, especially if you're a tank and objectives are on the map.
