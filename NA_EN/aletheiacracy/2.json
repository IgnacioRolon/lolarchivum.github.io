Then Yasuo has his wall which is another game breaker itself.. \r\n\r\nYasuo players don't need high reaction times when they have a shield that responds for them. \r\nYasuo's high mobility gets his Passive on quick cooldowns, making it even more frustrating to play against. \r\n\r\nPassive abilities aren't supposed to break games. Yasuo gets a damage blocking shield and doubles his crit chance before getting into his Active kit. \r\n\r\nIs this balance?","replies":[{"poster":"Tailypo","date":"2019-08-07T21:54:44.420+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"It's dumb af.

And you are ignoring the fact that he has another passive... that increases his damage. It doesn't matter that you can see it, it matters that his passives perform conflicting actions, unlike most other champs with two part passives.","replies":[{"poster":"Academy Kayn","date":"2019-08-08T04:21:28.446+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"You...you know you can see his flow bar charge yeah?
