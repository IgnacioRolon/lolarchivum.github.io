If this doesn't kill them, perhaps due to a shield, it quickly deals additional damage in an attempt to kill the target: first 10, then 100, etc., until it has dealt 1,111,110 additional true damage. If the target is still alive at that point, probably due to e.g. Kayle ult or Tryn ult, the execute gives up and stops dealing damage. Alistar's ult doesn't mitigate true damage, and it can't absorb damage equal to his current health plus at least 1,111,111 (for him to live with 1 hp), so it won't prevent his death.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pyrosan","date":"2019-08-16T18:19:20.734+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Na that's the mechanic if you drop below X you get executed regardless of your defences","replies":[{"poster":"Aletheiacracy","date":"2019-08-16T18:40:06.223+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"Stupid","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BeatzBoyFTW","date":"2019-08-16T23:33:32.192+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pyke's ult is an execution when the enemy is below a certain low HP threshold, thus ignoring any damage reduction &amp; shield.
