All they do is take from the integrity of Boards Discussions and turn a platform for civil discussion into a troll's den.\n\nIf a player has genuine concerns, other players should be discouraged from asserting the issue.

But if I tell these people that their comments are irrelevant, I can have my comment removed. And this isn't the first time. I have literally had my comments removed for calling arguments \"irrelevant\" to the topic. \n\nThe issue is Riot seems to ALLOW these people to take offense where none is literally present.
