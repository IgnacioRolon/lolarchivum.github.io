Assuming icsincorporated is your ISP, it looks like it's having some hiccups along the way and the hiccups continue throughout your trip to the game server.  You can use our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to help things tune up a bit, specifically the Configure DNS which can help change how you route.  Otherwise, you'll want to hit up your ISP and let them know about this so they can check out the node.  I hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
