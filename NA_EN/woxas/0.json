Insane ammounts of FPS lag which I have never experienced before. Like sub 25 FPS. I usually sit steady at 120ish however since the new patches or something I mustve done to my computer I can barely play. \r\n\r\n2.) Another thing to note is that for some reason there are 3 instances of league of legends running when I look at activity monitor to see why my game is basically crashing I will include a link to a screenshot. [ https://ibb.co/gBoPZQ ] Does anyone have any logical explanation for this, it would be greatly appreciated. \r\n\r\nI know my computer can handle league of legends It has for the past 2 years now, so that's what worries me - if it's a server issue or a hardware issue on my part.

Let's make sure to update your graphics drivers really quick, but if that doesn't seem to help check out the steps over here in our [**FPS guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting) for some more quick fixes.\n\nThose multiple instances of League are normal. League has a few different things running at once like the client and chat connections, so no worries there.","replies":[{"poster":"Woxas","date":"2017-09-28T21:56:52.632+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for clarifying on the multiple instances running, however I have never had to update a driver before as Im on mac, how would i go about doing so?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-28T22:30:38.606+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahhhhh you're on a Mac, I see.
