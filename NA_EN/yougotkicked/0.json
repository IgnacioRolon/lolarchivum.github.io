Riot does not overturn properly applied bans, and it seems that your account has gone through at least one escalation stage prior to that (and possibly 3+), so you were given opportunities to reform your behavior.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kokua","date":"2018-06-06T12:50:45.103+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You get multiple chances to reform before pushing all the way up to a permanent ban. Unless you can prove without a doubt that you were wrongly banned and have the community actually agree with you, then there's practically no hope for you. For the vast majority of permanent bans, they are justified and irreversible. Permanent bans that were lifted and brought a lot of attention to were not accounts being unbanned, but actual players who were banned and would be banned on sight in any future account. You can create a new account, and if you follow the rules, you won't have to worry about being banned. No amount of time or money spent will convince them to look the other way.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kareshi","date":"2018-06-06T14:47:03.066+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":7,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Aneirin","date":"2018-06-06T21:12:42.735+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow, you're making fun of a young kid.

This means a few things:\n> \n> * If someone asks in good faith why they were banned, tell them simply and without judgment.\n> * If someone asks for help, give them good suggestions without impugning them as a person.\n> * If someone offers help or advice and it is not appreciated, simply ignore it or respond respectfully.\n> * If someone disagrees with you on whether or not a punishment (or the system) is justified, don&amp;#039;t attack each other as people.\n> * If a conversation gets heated, it feels someone isn&amp;#039;t willing to discuss things civilly, or you&amp;#039;re frustrated that someone isn&amp;#039;t listening to you, simply bow out -- you don&amp;#039;t need to get the last word.\n> * If you wish simply to complain about the system, let us know in your opening post so we don&amp;#039;t try to offer advice.\n> * If you are not happy with your punishment or think the system is flawed, do not attack those who are telling you how it works, or why it works that way -- the system isn&amp;#039;t their fault.\n> * If you think someone&amp;#039;s actions are horrible, remember that it is their *actions* you should take umbrage with, not their personhood. Their behavior may have been toxic, but address their behavior and not the individual.\n> \n> #**Remember the purpose of this board is to inform, advise, and discuss player behavior and the punishment system. It is not to prove yourself right, change the opinions of people who do not want their opinion changed, laugh at/belittle players who have been punished, or laugh at/belittle players who support the existing system.**","replies":[]},{"poster":"Aneirin","date":"2018-06-08T00:18:31.026+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{sticker:sg-miss-fortune}}","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"HalcyonDweller","date":"2018-06-08T00:28:57.018+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why would your name be relevant to what happened? Not gonna lie, there are a lot of people named Mohammed in the world, you being one of them is not pertinent at all to whether you deserved to be punished or not.\n\nGenerally a thread title is made with words pertaining to the content of the thread. For example in your case, \"I got permabanned,\" or, \"unfair ban.\"\n\nIf you received a punishment then it's probably because you did something you shouldn't have. Try and take this as a learning opportunity and figure out what it was that you did to get punished, so you know not to do it in the future.\n\nThat stuff aside, calm down. I know it feels like the end of the world, but it's just a game.
