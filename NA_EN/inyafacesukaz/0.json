I got my PBE confirmation email after 2 or 3 weeks of waiting and it wanted me to create my account. But when I click on the link, it says that my application was received instead of bringing me to the screen to create my account. I don&#039;t know if this usually happens or not but, can some one help me out? Any help would be appreciated.\n\nUpdate: I got a second email that says I need to sign up by November 3 and that my account has been \"unlocked\", but I am still having no luck with my original problem. {{item:3070}} ","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-10-30T16:51:55.708+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hiya INYAFACESUKAZ,\n\nThere was a bug with the PBE sign up last night.
