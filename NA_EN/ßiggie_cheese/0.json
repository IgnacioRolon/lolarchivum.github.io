Right now there's a delay between when you initiate minion dematerializer and when the minion dematerializes. This makes things like using the minion dematerializer to remove a minion and then quickly using blitzcrank's Q to pull an enemy before they have time to reposition infeasible.

Because taking this to champions that have great wave clear early would result too much push power, the same reason is that this rune should be tied to autoattack only. The rune should help player last hit, not push the wave ultra fast under tower.\n\n- Why disable it in 15 minutes?

There is a tank tree, one thats clearly for jungling, one that is for attack damage and one for magic. \n\nUtility is a support niche which is why I say it's primarily for supporting.\n\nmany of the benefits that come with said utility tree barely helps late game, as klepto falls off after late game, boots dont matter late game and neither do biscuits after 12 minutes.\n\nAfter 12 minutes I dont see the utility tree being very useful asides from gold you may get with klepto and potions to stay in lane. I feel it is 100% a support tree as it encourages the people who use it to be geared faster and rely on gold income from the tree rather than anything else.\n\nEnd game is where it falls off which is why I see it mostly for supports who dont need the damage as they are feeding kills to carries anyway, they just need the items to carry. \n\nhowever I am not here to argue whether the tree is for supports or not, its just the impression I get from the tree. I still dont see why there is any use for the minion ability  feel its very lack luster and offers little to nothing for anyone using it. (Unless they are terrible at early game farm which I doubt is much of an issue competitively as thats the only skill that I can see people logically prioritizing early game when they decide to take rank seriously.)\n\nI dont understand why I was downvoted as I didnt see anything rude with the fact I feel the rune is useless. *Shrugs to each their own though, I cant really take the boards seriously as they are as salty as the real game at times.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Solidair3","date":"2017-12-01T18:37:27.849+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's a lot of things in the inspiration tree that benefit roles other than support.\n\nIt's simply opting into utility instead of raw damage or tankiness.","replies":[{"poster":"Liveey","date":"2017-12-06T05:37:06.913+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Solidair3,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=f6mplEym,comment-id=00050001,timestamp=2017-12-01T18:37:27.849+0000)\n>\n> There&#x27;s a lot of things in the inspiration tree that benefit roles other than support.\n> \n> It&#x27;s simply opting into utility instead of raw damage or tankiness.\n\nIm sorry I just dont see it being very useful to other roles when it comes to late game *shrugs, however the point of my comment surrounding the minion rune still stands.
