I install the game and open up the launcher and straight away I get the patcher kernel error. \r\nI've tried looking up the solution on the forums and tried multiple methods; opening as admin, opening as admin from the file location, etc.\r\nBecause its the first time I open the game, I have no patches to delete either and reinstall doesn't solve the problem. \r\nMy specs are:\r\nWindows 7 Ultimate 64-bit SP1\r\nIntel Core i5-4460 CPU @3.2GHz\r\n8GB RAM\r\nNVIDIA GeForce GTX960\r\n\r\nThank you in advance","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-04-05T23:58:11.095+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This kernel error is usually caused by a security setting preventing the patcher from launching.
