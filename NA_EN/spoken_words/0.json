I mentioned that I might lag out and my Yasuo said he had the same problem and had to reconnect like me. After it took me two attempts to get my framerate back (last game it took three and the one before that once) - I asked the Yasuo and he said he drops from 80fps to 20fps, while I drop from 60fps to 15fps?\r\n\r\nThe issue? Since Ascension hasn't been touched, this is some ABUSRD spaghetti coding since it happens at the same time (countdown ends) and with the same impact (you drop 1/4 of your fps)","replies":[{"poster":"Dvelasquera","date":"2017-05-21T02:11:03.598+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its not the connection, it happened to me too.","replies":[{"poster":"Spoken Words","date":"2017-05-21T02:15:57.139+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you Mac or?","replies":[{"poster":"Dvelasquera","date":"2017-05-21T18:36:48.926+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mac","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-20T20:18:26.816+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Though you mention fps issues, it sounds like your connection could be having problems if you're attempting to reconnect during game.

Nobody wants to play a game with a AFK teammate reconnecting one, two, three times and everytime saying \"ok I think I fixed my lag\" \"ffs nvm\" *a summoner has disconnected* *a summoner has reconnected* over 10 minutes.\n\nedit - I have no idea which one is my Ascension game, I have to go count \n\nedit 2 - If this is only for connection issues, then this is different from my issue. But it could be related to another issue - I had a lot of issues loading into a game, came in when the timer says 6 minutes or so, but it was before 3 minutes (otherwise team would had remade) - I had stable FPS but my game speed was at slow-mo. As in, I'm not lagging, I'm not spiking, but everything was occurring at 1/2 speed yet I was CSing well (though my jungler said I look like I was lagging).","replies":[{"poster":"LoudBoi","date":"2017-05-28T20:00:45.017+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same for me here. 19-24ms not spiking, not connection issue i haven't had to reconnect at all. Summoners Rift is fine, Ascension was fine earlier in year. But this time it is literally unplayable, even on Low gfx. 7fps. Also on Mac","replies":[]}]}]}]}
