I get that the crew is an EU-based crew, and I get that translates into a certain amount of desire to watch &quot;your region&quot; do well.  But it really sucks having no choice other than to listen to this particular commentary crew all weekend root against every single team you are cheering for, for hours on end.\r\n\r\nSolutions include:\r\n\r\n- Train your casters to take a more neutral tone when calling these games and breaking down matches.  \r\n \r\nor\r\n\r\n- Offer an NA-centric cast/team to also watch the series from so I don&#039;t have to listen to the biases against my teams all weekend long.\r\n\r\nCurious if others felt the same way about the coverage this week.

In one instance, one of them was talking about how the EU Blitz could flash E and then pull to interrupt the jump of the NA Trist, and even seemed to think that would happen several times.  The other commentators at least pointed out that it was significantly more likely that the Trist would just constantly break Blitz's pull with her jump.\n\nThe bias of at least one of them was pretty blatant (the others were neutral enough to me), but it was entertaining enough in how over the top it was.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Randomonium","date":"2017-07-07T22:44:18.502+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I didn't think it was too bad at all.

However, it's Rift Rivals.  NA and EU trash talk each other all the time.  This is a tournament for bragging rights and to at least temporarily settle the score until Worlds.  The casters should be allowed to take jabs back and forth as well.\n\nExpectations by casters on both sides were that EU was favored.  Even this past Sunday on LCS Tonight, Dash, Zirene and Azael were all in agreement that EU had the advantage going in.\n\nI personally would have liked to have seen more trash talk back and forth between the casters, but I thought they kept it pretty professional.  Casters on both sides getting that hyped up excited tone when someone on either side makes a big play.\n\nI watched most, but not all of the games over the past few days.  If I'm not mistaken, each game had a caster crew of 2 EU and 1 NA or 1 EU and 2 NA.\n\nNow the analyst desk was always run by Sjokz and the player analysts were from EU teams who were not competing, which is to be expected given location and logistics.\n\nThe casters bring life into watching LCS matches.  You get used to hearing them and I'm sure most people have their favorite casters just like they have their favorite players.  I honestly would have been bored if it were cast by casters from other regions.  It's not that the other regions have bad casters, but you don't feel the buy-in or connection to our 'home' teams as you do with the ones you usually hear.  I feel this sometimes while watching games at MSI or worlds.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Lexer","date":"2017-07-08T22:17:51.285+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"a) The EU casters are, in my opinion, better than the NA casters\nb) The EU casters are in agreement that EU is sucking at the moment\nc) It's nearly impossible to be completely unbiased","replies":[]},{"poster":"Late For Tea","date":"2017-07-08T11:52:50.781+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Are you watching the same broadcast as I am? Because Sjokz repeatedly states that NA should bask in their glory, whenever Kobe or Jatt is being humble. And both Trashy and Amazing show pretty much no EU-pride, instead blatantly saying over and over that EU is getting stomped by NA, and that the NA teams are plain better.\nThe only caster who has shown some favoratism towards EU is Jatt, but even then he's just being realistic instead of trash talking.\n\nBoth the analyst desk and caster crew is a mix of both EU and NA representatives. It always includes at least one NA member. So I don't know why you accuse the europeans of favoratism.\n\nIn fact, the caster/analyst who has shown the most favoratism for a region is Phreak, in favor of NA. Listening to him as an EU player is annoying.","replies":[]}]}
