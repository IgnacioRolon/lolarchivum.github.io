Normally it should work considering I am putting it at the resolutions it should operate at.\r\n\r\nMy monitor is a Dell S2716 DG P64CW M0B401 that is capable of 1440p and 144 Hz but I use 85 Hz since I am using only one mini display port capable of an extra 15 Hz per port used from the normal 60. My GPU is an AMD Raedon 6870 and I'm running Windows 10 after the Creators update.\r\n\r\nMy old 1080p 60 Hz monitor did not have this issue at all. It worked fine. The problems arose as soon as I got my new monitor. The game works in Windowed just fine, its just full screen brings no signal to the monitor.\r\n\r\nI've tried re installing the game in hopes to see it fixed and I deleted my cfg file before re installing and after re installing but with no luck.\r\n\r\nI have no idea why it's not working at all and I am in need of a solution as I always hated playing in Windowed since I am so used to full screen.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-07T01:33:20.713+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So basically, it sounds like there's some difference between the resolution you're trying to run in-game as opposed to what resolution your monitor is running. Double check that League is set to run at the same resolution that your desktop is set to, and let me know if that works!","replies":[{"poster":"Shądow","date":"2017-08-07T17:32:18.522+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It does run at  the same supported resolutions, its just that full screen in any resolution fails to work for some reason.","replies":[{"poster":"DarkRitual","date":"2017-08-07T20:40:37.650+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have you tried windowed fullscreen?","replies":[{"poster":"Shądow","date":"2017-08-08T00:48:44.919+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Windowed full screen does work but I'm a bit surprised that full screen doesn't.","replies":[{"poster":"DarkRitual","date":"2017-08-08T11:00:03.409+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Does fullscreen at those resolutions work for other games, or is League the only problem?\nAlternatively, windowed fullscreen is generally preferred, due to fewer such issues arising.","replies":[{"poster":"Shądow","date":"2017-08-10T19:12:22.513+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes it does.
