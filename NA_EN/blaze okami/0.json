I mean even if I understand most part of the game I was disconnected I did my best to reconnect and then help to win the game. If its okay it would be nice to be positioned at Gold2 0PL which would be where i would have ended if I win that promotion.\r\n\r\nThis match history shows the 3 promotion games: 1Won with poppy, 1Loss with Sion and finally 2 Win with Garen (The game where I DC).\r\n\r\nSincerly, Gotthard.","replies":[{"poster":"Mega MilkJugs","date":"2018-08-30T12:24:05.636+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"same thing has happened to be.\nalso makes you feel like not bothering to reconnect once you know you'll lose lp anyway","replies":[]},{"poster":"Friendly Ram","date":"2018-08-30T00:21:23.211+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you're afk for a couple of minutes it counts as a loss for you whether your team wins or loses.","replies":[{"poster":"Blaze Okami","date":"2018-08-30T00:23:09.924+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That is actually so sad, im sure anyone who takes a look at the replay could see i tried my best to reconnect and keeep on playing.","replies":[{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2018-08-30T00:25:04.310+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Gotthard,realm=EUW,application-id=LqLKtMpN,discussion-id=ILvjRHUL,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2018-08-30T00:23:09.924+0000)\n>\n> That is actually so sad, im sure anyone who takes a look at the replay could see i tried my best to reconnect and keeep on playing.\n\nDoesn't matter, as the system cant tell the difference between someone purposly doing it, and accidentally trying their best","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Blaze Okami","date":"2018-08-30T00:25:02.419+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That is actually so sad, im sure anyone who takes a look at the replay could see i tried my best to reconnect and keeep on playing.
