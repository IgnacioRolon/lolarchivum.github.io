Anyway:\r\n\r\n&quot; we believe League at its best is an incredibly competitive experience&quot;\r\n\r\nNo this is why league is such a toxic community. Competition without face to face repercussion of bad behavior its clearly a recipe for bad vibes. And in order to foster an esport that will &quot;last generations&quot;, you need player base and fans. You are losing that. Between the crappy game state, new moba&#039;s like over watch coming out drawing people away, and forcing the hyper tense stressful competitive environment, its only a matter of time.\r\n\r\n&quot;We want League to grow into a true team sport and, at times, progress has been painful.&quot;\r\n\r\nI believe in this vision riot is having and would love for this to become some sort of officially sanctioned, widely recognized and accepted sport.  But we this vision shouldn&#039;t cloud their judgement to heavily.  Sports across the board from basketball to hockey, gymnastics to football, they are all things athletes choose to do FOR FUN.  Yes its competitive but enjoyment should really be the primary focus.  And the people who invented the sports made the rules and just started playing, adding rules as they came across problems.  So I think its frustrating that everything is so subject to change all the time and that some things are so set in stone ingrained into peoples brains.  The game of basketball was changed forever when a few players made the allyoop (or however you spell that) where they would just throw the ball near the basket for a teammate to dunk, rather than intending it to be a shot.  And that was such a fascinating thing to see.  I remember the hype around the Korean ezreal &quot;blue build&quot; when it first came about.  It was cool to see that innovation come from players, and while that may not directly relate the point I&#039;m trying to make is I think its unhealthy for the game when riot says &quot;No we don&#039;t like champion X being played in Y  fashion so were changing Z so that you have to do A&quot;.  I remember a time when there was no meta and people took what ever champions anywhere and no one gave a damn, and i wish riot and pro players alike would abolish that meta of ad/supp bot ect.  Its lame that someone has to have the bitch roll who isn&#039;t allowed to farm and is just expected to suck another players wiener the whole time.  Also there is an old saying that goes &quot;Talent hits a target no one else can hit, a genius hits a target no one else can see&quot;.  I believe there are many ways to compose a team that don&#039;t need to follow this strict meta.  Some could be weaker, some could be stronger.  But we never find out because as soon as i pick something that&#039;s out of the ordinary my team starts flaming and tilting.\r\n\r\n&quot;improving the solo player experience against premades, lowering queue times, and smoothing out role selection weight&quot;\r\n\r\nThe issue here is that the one player who is solo is subject to lack of communication, likely to be scapegoated and blamed if things go wrong, and will just likely have a below adequate experience when playing with a team of 4 people.  I&#039;m not sure that having the two separate ladders was the greatest thing either, so I&#039;m not sure how to better remedy this situation but its a disaster as it stands imo.\r\n\r\n&quot;Quick caveat: when we say sandbox mode, we&rsquo;re specifically referring to a training mode where players can practice core skills - not a sandbox &lsquo;modify your game in any way&rsquo; mode.&quot;\r\n\r\nWhy? Why?  Why why why WHY WHY WHY WHY WHY WHY WHY WHY WHY??!?!?!?!?!?\r\nThis was the most aggravating thing for me as i have felt strongly about that crap hole that is custom game mode.  If players want to go into a custom match where URF is turned on, and all for one is turned on, why the hell cant they?  Why not All for one Ascension?  All for one URF Ascension? WHY NOT.  Now I&#039;m not saying those are good ideas or fun, but the community will naturally act like an economy and filter out things that aren&#039;t fun through the lobby process.  Players who create rules and game modes that people enjoy will have lobbies that fill up, while they players that are making weird rules that are crappy will sit in a lobby till they get bored and realize no one is coming and they leave.  Riot you worked hard to make these game modes, the players WHO MAKE YOUR GAME POSSIBLE, VISION, AND DREAM COME TO LIFE, have come to enjoy them a lot, and there is no reason to not let us play them.  People will still pay attention to the pro scene, and the ranked competitive ladder will still function and exist, but players will have options.  Sometimes im not feeling the greatest and don&#039;t want to compete but want to play league.  Everyone has bad days and if im not performing well i wont play ranked.  Why not let me have a fun way to still enjoy your game on those days?  Refusing that is what drives players to play other games instead.  Also a flux of players in ranked or a lack of players in ranked could indicate things about the state of the game.  \r\n\r\nI&#039;m gonna add a little bit of my game state opinions here at the end just for funzies.\r\n\r\nI think devourer and rageblade need to be toned down.  OR i think defensive items need to be reworked and tuned up because I dont feel very protected with many of the items, more specifically the armor items.  Which is a testimate to how OP AA reliant and AD casters are right now and im hoping the mage update mid season will help this a little bit.  Maw got a little nerfed, but lets be real the magic resist items are so good at what they do, while i can have omen AND frozen heart and still fear ad champions, who now also puish me for getting hp and armor both WITH ONE ITEM {{item:3036}}.  And I think that warlords bloodlust shouldnt be able to have ANY benifit from minions.  What fun is laning if i chunk a champion with warlords and they heal that 30% of hp back that i took from them, before my CD&#039;s are ready again and do it just as a reward for farming which they are doing anyway.  Not to mention the desparity between A resourceless champion with warlords laning against a champion with mana.  Also this fast meta sucks.\r\n\r\nI doubt this will even reach the eyes of a Rioter, which is sad because having played since before season one, I feel pretty in tune with whats going on.","replies":[{"poster":"I am Pacman","date":"2016-04-16T04:46:34.112+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is going to take forever but some things just irked me to much to leave this pose alone.\n\n> \" we believe League at its best is an incredibly competitive experience\"         No this is why league is such a toxic community....\n\nLeague having a toxic community has nothing to do with it being at its best when its competitive.\n\nI agree with riot on that my best experiences in league have been in ranked ques where it was incredibly competitive and we won using our brains and mechanics.  The fact that some games are toxic does not nullify that many people myself included find the game most fun when everyone is pulling out all the stops and trying their best.  \n\nYour response had nothing to do with the quote from riots post.  It was more general complaining about crappy game state and the fact that all online team games are toxic.\n\n> Your second really long paragraph\n\nNormals are the for fun aspect of the game.  That covers the first 1/3rd of that paragraph\n\nThe koreans are still inovating.  And basketball isn't the greatest comparison as its been played pretty much the same way for a long time now (thats not a bad thing)  just like how our meta of adc/sup bot has been around for a long time now.  In both cases its because it is simply the best strategy available.\n\nSure its unhealthy sometimes when riot nerfs champs when they become popular, but most of the time its because those champs were stupidly broken or just ruined the fun for other people.  Don't tell me you would rather riot didn't fix ap yi, tank fiora, top or mid lane soraka (that shit was so fucking stupid), top/mid lulu (same shit as raka).  The innovations that are fun and healthy like blue ez (although half the community would disagree that blue ez is good for the game) stay in the game.  Blue ez ever since it was discovered has always been a viable build on him.\n\nOn the whole support role.  I like that role.  Not everygame or hell even 30% of my games but when I play support I enjoy it.  It's not the hellhole you seem to think it is.  Sure its not the same level of recognition for your skill as say an assassin but its an important role and in a game with limited gold, 5 people and only 4 sources of gold its not suprising that champs who can have massive impact with almost no gold (alistar, janna, thresh) are going to be played with no gold.  You can't just simply abolish the best strategy. You need to find a better one first to replace it.\n\n3rd respose paragraph, the one with all the WHY WHY WHY.\n\nWell simply put, no.  You can't have all that shit all the time.  Every time riot releases game modes it has to be patched and balanced for any new champs items,  or sometimes new champ interations break the game mode (imagine if 80% cd reduction or illaoi tentacles and then you say you want all for one and who knows wtf will happen. Can the servers handle it? How would the game know where to put tentacles, there are only a limited number of spots. What if they are all full etc.  They have to go through that proccess every time they make a game mode and then do it again after every patch.  Never mind how many goddam new servers are going to be needed to host all of the different versions of custom games.\n\nAlso Rotating que just started,  Its pretty cool and makes sure game modes don't get boring. Check it out.\n\n> Everyone has bad days and if im not performing well i wont play ranked. Why not let me have a fun way to still enjoy your game on those days?\n\nWhat?  Play a normals then.  Make sure the people you are playing with are ok that you are adc teemo but go right ahead and just have fun. Nobody is getting in your way.  Or get some friends and just fuck around in normals doing stupid comps like I do. (wombo combos, Snipe comps,  All tank, all support etc)\n\nLast but not least Game balance.\n\nRage blade and devourer are in a decent spot now.  They were broken as fuck a couple patches ago but they have since then fixed them and are no longer pick or ban.  As for tanks I have no Idea what you are talking about.  Maybe you havn't noticed but we have been getting MORE tank builds not less tank builds in our games.  Tank Fiora and yi were a problem, then it was akali, now its ekko.  \n\nMage update incoming so wait and see if that fixes or breaks the game again.\n\nLord Dominiks is not op.  Its bonus armor not all armor, the old last whisper used to be more effective.  The bonus damage doesn't punish you for building hp.  Unless you are also an adc or a very squishy assasin then you are always going to have more hp than an adc.  Hell most of the base hp and hp per level for tanks and mages is better than adcs (not to mention half the mages get roa anyways).  On top of all this its usually the 4th or 5th item built so it doesn't come in to play that often anyways.\n\nAlso since season 1 and still not ranked? I'm confused.\n\nJust my two cents.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kadranos","date":"2016-04-15T21:53:27.376+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with everything about your state of the game. Defensive options are ridiculously scarce, and in the end, are hardly relevant when an ADC is wielding {{item:3036}} (Against armored \"tanks\", if you can call them that anymore.) They get melted all the same..might as well just build full damage and slam their ADC as hard as you can and hope for a kill. \n\nAnother issue is the CDR/Crit combo items..AD Carries DO NOT need cooldown reduction! And then you combine it with crit bonus? 45% cdr is honestly a mainstay of the game now. Where is the creativity in that? Non-Caster oriented ad's are largely irrelevant now due to that fact, and it puts these caster-oriented AD's in a class of their own.\n\nDevourer definitely needs to be toned down; can still get by 16 minutes in an optimal game, at which point you are the leading destructive force for the rest of the game until very, very late if it somehow lasts that long.\n\nI'll be frank, this game has seen better,more balanced days. I, like you, have been here since before S1.","replies":[]}]}
