I cant chat in game, no one responds, so I have no idea if team mates see my 'chat'. It is very frustrating. \r\nAnyone seen this before? My chat in post game stats works just fine. Only happens in game.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-04T21:51:08.842+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's really strange, I've never heard of this issue before.
