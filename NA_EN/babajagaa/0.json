Riot (and by extension, their IFS) is. Your behavior was deemed unsportsmanlike and over the line, hence you getting punished.","replies":[{"poster":"FF or QQ","date":"2019-03-27T20:21:51.607+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Well I'll point you to the jayce qoute to the left of the screen.  He's fine to debate whether or not his behavior warrants punishment.  This is partly what these forums are for.  We are the judges of our behavior, Riot bans people for toxic behavior because they think the majority of players are onboard with that.  And tbh, I don't think this merits a report.  It's mild.  They were bickering.  Thats it.  I would just say mute annoying players dont debate them.  I'm one of the ones who think bans and suspensions are too much and chat restrictions are borderline too much.  We could mute one another, turn the other cheek, be the bigger person.  Rather than angrily check report boxes out of revenge.  Though thats my opinion like that calling someone a twat being a punishable offence is an opinion.  Both deserve equal respect everyone believes different things and its better to be tactful and respectful.  But Ill just ignore someone if theyre a dick to me.  Like one time back in highschool this kid said \"you have a very punchable face to me\" while hanging out with me and my friends.  So I didn't say anything just gave him a funny look and walked away as all my friends followed me.  Needless to say he had upmost respect for me then.  I don't believe in punishment over words only leading by example and turning the other cheek.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Telephone Booth","date":"2019-03-27T21:38:50.874+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Aggrivation,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=WVLMo4BJ,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2019-03-27T18:35:59.760+0000)\n>\n> I am aware thatv i was negative and sarcastic, but as I stated, it was nothing extravagant or wothy of being punished.\n\nYou need to realize thats what the rules are against. Theyre trying to squelch negativity. Therefore, it is so very obviously worthy of punishment. Dont like it? Join the club and play a different game, or learn to stop saying anything negative/insulting in chat.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"UnversedSoul","date":"2019-03-27T16:45:25.750+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Don't be toxic then.
