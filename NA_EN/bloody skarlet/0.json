However I did it using \"I have a question about League of Legends/Riot Games\" instead of any purchase or RP option since it wanted my credit card info which I felt slightly uncomfortable sharing. As for whether my card has money in it or the information in the shop is answered correctly, yes to both. So I do hope this error gets fixed soon. It hit me at a real bad time.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Kokua","date":"2017-12-16T16:35:56.297+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You should wait a full 24 hours before making another attempt.

That would make no sense considering if I give it a try and it's like 23 hours and 50 minutes past the last try to just reset it entirely. I highly doubt that's the case though I am willing to try. A better decision I thought would be doing a full repair. Not sure if that would help.","replies":[{"poster":"Kokua","date":"2017-12-16T16:49:45.952+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A repair wouldn't do anything, as it isn't a client issue.
