That message just appears beause it is easier to have it coded to appear everytime someone attempts to quit a game, than chance it not appearing in a ranked or normal game and allow people to leave with no punishment.","replies":[{"poster":"Mr Thing","date":"2015-06-25T04:39:09.661+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alrighty thanks😁","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Darkmind1212","date":"2015-06-24T07:44:50.523+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1.) all bot game? You are clearly still new and need to play a bit more till it will allow you to\n     go to pvp. It is to make sure you at least know what you are doing before hand.\n2.) leaving can get you banned.
