I learned it was a beta testing client, and I realized that I really wanted to try it out and have it. I signed up a month or so later from then, and I completely forgot about it until a few months back due to videos of trying out all the new skins, and new champ teasers and such. Do you guys know how long it takes to get accepted? It's been nearly 2 years, so Im not sure if I will ever get an account :3. Im sorry if theres a thread on this already, but I'm busy and this was probably faster than looking for the answers","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-09T03:47:55.157+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's no set time on how long it takes to get into the PBE. Furthermore, there's no *guarantee* that you'll get into the PBE, as there is specific criteria that you'll need to meet for an invite. The exact criteria depend on what we're testing at the time, however, the most consistent is that we look for *really active* players who have no history or negative behavior.\n\nCheck out our [PBE FAQ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751904-Public-Beta-Environment-FAQ#top) for a closer look at how the system works.
