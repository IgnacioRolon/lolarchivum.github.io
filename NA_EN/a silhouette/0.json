If you literally cannot NOT feed as Ashe jungle and play it frequently then it will most likely lead to you being punished for intentional feeding because the system or whoever looking at games will think the consistent trend of you feeding as doing it intentionally. Most people WON'T report you if you play a non meta pick AND do well or decent, but will most likely perceive poor performance with a non meta pick as intentionally trolling the game.  The frequency of things happening is actually a very important aspect in whether or not a person gets punished in cases that aren't hacking/account sharing/death threats.  A one time offender who is toxic in a game is not going to be punished, it's continued behavior that leads to people being punished in most cases.","replies":[{"poster":"Gary B Enkelis","date":"2016-08-27T22:46:24.405+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think after a while people stop caring about picks and stuff, kind of how we were when the game was new.
