Causing the game to crash, freeze, or bug out.  Each time resulting in me having to wait longer and longer for a queue for abandoning a game.\r\n\r\nInstance 1:\r\n\r\nRanked solo queue.  I was last pick.  So when it was my turn to ban I proceeded to search my ban.  I type in Leona, and as she came up on the screen I was unable to select her.  She was not previously banned, but her character icon was grayed out.  Since Leo didn't work, I typed \"M\" to search Malphite and tried to ban him.. nothing.. grey icon.  So I clear search box and just start clicking frantically as there's less then 10 seconds left.  \"Ban\" box stays grey and I end up \"Dodging\" .. Resulting in me waiting 5 minutes to play next game.\r\n\r\nInstance 2:\r\n\r\nOne For All solo.  Champion select begins and my screen is bugged out.  My spell icons are missing and my ward avatar menu is screwy.  I minimize the screen and maximize.. nothing.  So i just let it be.  We all get finished with champ selection (end up with Illiao).  I begin to select my masteries and click all around the spells icon area hoping something will pop up.  Voila it worked I am able to select Teleport and Flash.  I click Ok and the game crashes.  Complete exit of game.  I log back in and I am on a blank screen, no menu, no youtube video, no news feed, no \"buy\" skin box...  just the gradient black to dark blue.  So close the game, wait a few seconds, and re-open.  Opens normally.  I jump to play my last One For All, but now I'm in the Abandoned Queue screen again.. this time for 15minutes.\r\n................\r\nI am using old client and have not updated to Beta.  I've never had any crashing problems previously.  It's annoying that I am being punished for things I'm not even doing.  I understand it's a precautionary thing, but as of now, I feel like my loyalty and gaming etiquette for League is being pushed and poked.  I don't want to play another game because I fear the game will crash and I will be in a 20 minute queue and then a 30 minute queue and so on.  I figure since I had the \"game crash\" popups come up, Riot should know I did not \"Dodge.\"  Hopefully my descriptions help fix this crashing problem I feel the game has at the moment.  If not, I hope you enjoyed my rant.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-30T04:31:57.580+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A lot of the issues you've described are common symptoms of a poor connection to the League servers. As a preventative measure against further disconnections, I'd recommend working through our [connection guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to address the most common culprits of these issues.\n\nI also wanted to mention that due to the very nature of a disconnection, the server cannot distinguish between you unplugging your router, losing power to your home or simply closing the client, the server simply sees you disconnect. \n\nLet me know if those steps improved your situation.","replies":[]}]}
