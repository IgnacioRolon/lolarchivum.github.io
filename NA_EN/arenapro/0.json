I don't like it and how do i disable \"alt\" key? Ex: I was channeling recall home, I \"alt\"+ left click baron timer to let my teammate know how long until baron spawn or my Ultimate cooldowns. My character automatically move to where I alt+left click and cancel recall home. I really hate it when it happen.\r\n I have 4 accounts. One of the account when I alt+left click, the character wouldn't response to where I alt+left click on the map. I found it really convenient to announce the timer for buff/baron/summon skill timer without cancelling recall home, but I forgot which hotkey do I change to make it happened. Can anyone help me to figure it out which hotkey to change to for timer/cooldown announcement or disable alt key?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-11T19:58:56.229+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's really strange, as I thought the alt key was reserved to pings.  Are you using any special touchpad or third party programs that is making your alt act as a mouse key?  If not, I recommend resetting your configuration folder if it's become corrupt or modified at any point:\n\n **Log into the game** then hop into **a custom game**. *Alt+Tab* out of the match, then navigate to your League installation folder, which should be in C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\n\nDelete the folder named **Config**\n\nOnce you've deleted the folder, leave the custom match. You'll then want to hop into another custom match to confirm the changes were saved.\n\nHopefully, that will fix things up.","replies":[]}]}
