I'm getting pissed off because some of you have the options to not troll others on their posts, but for those of you who think that you can talk piss and moan bs to other gamers proves YOU are really the mtf who Shouldn't be allowed to post anymore AND you should be kicked off the Post for Blatantly starting a fight with your ridicules and accuses, but the only person causing them is you. You who always want to fight with the posters, who always try to act like you know everything and acting like your a GM or some other BS, but really you just someone who stalks even the great people who helped create this game and who moderate these forums. You don't want anyone else to talk or listen UNLESS YOU GET TO TALK FIRST. I NEVER LISTEN BEFORE OR IN GAME AND I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH THE FACT THAT GETING INTO AN ARGUEMENT WITH A TROLLER IN GAME WILL AUTOMATICALLY MAKE THEM AUTO REPORT FROM THEM AND FOREVER MORE!! you have nothing left to comment except negative opinions, but when you start talking of the negative I START TALKING ABOUT YOU. I hope I get a Credential report for this honestly, because this isn't only the trollers and poor gamer attitudes, but it is also RIOT's fault!","replies":[{"poster":"gr8job","date":"2015-04-09T06:22:18.102+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"You seem to be pretty aware of what he DIDN'T say, but did you take the time to read OP's original, two-sentence post?
