In the first two days of my upgrade to Windows 10 the game was running fine but lately my ms has become unbearable. It has reached the point where none of my abilities will activate until 5 or 20 seconds later. I really don't know if its my internet or my drivers but I really need help.","replies":[{"poster":"Zaynexus","date":"2016-07-26T21:12:24.876+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay I solved the problem!
