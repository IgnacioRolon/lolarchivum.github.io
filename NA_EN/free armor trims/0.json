I noticed after my teleport that the color of Radiant Wukong had been primarily gray-ish white such as when he enters his death animation/figure. However, the rings around his staff were glowing golden. I asked my teammates if they could see this visual bug themselves, however none replied. The game ended soon after my teleport so I was unable to see if it would revert back to normal colors at all or if it could even be recreated easily. This was on the NA server in case that information is needed.","replies":[{"poster":"LeeVí","date":"2018-03-24T22:35:42.911+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://youtu.be/EAflNIomf1g","replies":[]},{"poster":"LeeVí","date":"2018-03-24T19:28:50.125+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yes im getting that bug too its so annoying and wrote a thread about it","replies":[]},{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2018-03-23T19:08:50.112+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey! \n\nWe're trying to track this down! Would you be able to give me your R3dlogs from that game?\n\nTL;DR - A match log is created each time you play a game. It contains vital information about your loading process and will log any errors that occur during the course of the game. These logs are essential for troubleshooting in situations where you have problems in-game.\n\nEach file appears like this: [yyyy-mm-ddT15-40-03] _r3dlog.txt, where yyyy-mm-dd is the date of the match played.\n\nYou can find them here:\n\nC:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Logs\\GameLogs, under the time and date stamped folder for the game in which you had issues.\n\n**EDIT**: Okay! Figured it out! Looks like it's just when he dies, the gray overlay is reapplying once he's alive again.
