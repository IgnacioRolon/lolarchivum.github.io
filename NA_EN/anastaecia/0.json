Four enter, two come out.  That&#039;s it.  Nothing else to see here.  Same in the other 3 groups.  To compare 2nd place records...there was only 1 team with 4 wins.  Misfits had 3 just like C9.  NOw you can argue that C9 got lucky that there wasn&#039;t another 3-win team in the end, like in Group D, but that&#039;s a result of the group as a whole ending up with 5,3,2,2 wins. SKT was only 1/4 of that equation.\n\nIn general, there are only 12 wins to be had.  Chances are, the Group winners will go  5-1 (with a nice 6-0 by Longzhu).  That means the other 3 teams are fighting over 7 wins in the hope for 4, but prob 3 to advance (with a possible playoff).  There's not a whole lot of lee way.  If you get 2nd, you earned it struggling for those few wins.","replies":[{"poster":"xx12xx2019","date":"2017-10-15T12:15:29.502+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":6,"body":"Fans and League casters disagree with you.\n\nNA is yet again getting easiest way to the finals and disappoints the most.","replies":[{"poster":"ValyrianBlade","date":"2017-10-15T12:57:34.222+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=xx12xx2019,realm=EUW,application-id=9hBQwnEU,discussion-id=mEkoM1bR,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-10-15T12:15:29.502+0000)\n>\n> Fans and League casters disagree with you.\n> \n> NA is yet again getting easiest way to the finals and disappoints the most.\n\nFnatic had a much luckier way / got carried much harder than C9 did. They went 2-4 and still managed to get in to tiebreakers. Them winning the 2 tiebreaks means nothing, 2-4 (+2) is a worse record than 3-3. \n\nI think it becomes rather apparent if you stop caring about the order of matches and just the results. If order didn't matter, I should be able to re-order the results and people should still feel the same.\n\nEDG goes 2-1 in week 1 with a heartbreaking loss to SKT. C9 is 1-2, and AHQ is 1-2 with a shock win over SKT. SKT is 2-1. \nSKT goes 3-0 in week 2. EDG shockingly goes 0-3, imploding even worse than TSM or IMT! C9 goes 2-1 and qualifies with an exceptional week 2.\n\nJust because EDG collapsed in week 1 instead of week 2, doesn't mean their not qualifying for quarters is any more acceptable than TSM or IMT (It should be much worse since they had higher expectations being the top seed from China). \n\nLikewise:\nFnatic goes 2-1 in week 1. Longzhu goes 3-0 as expected. IMT goes 0-3, and GAM goes 1-2. IMT appears down and out.\nLongzhu goes 3-0 again. GAM goes 1-2 against. Fnatic collapses to go 0-3 while IMT goes 2-1. There's a 3-way tie break and Fnatic manages to pull it back together to get in to quarters.\nNow that's a story of a team falling apart and managing to pull it back together just in time. That's now a story of IMT making a miracle comeback attempt but falling just short.\n\nThe order doesn't matter. Either you get read in week 2, or you come unprepared in week 1. NA has done the former far too much and needs to learn better. I don't believe this is the first time EDG has done the latter though.\n\nAnd, if anything, AHQ helped C9 out of groups, not SKT. If EDG 2-0'd AHQ like they were expected to (rather than 1-1'ing SKT which I don't think anyone expected, although they won early hard both times) then they'd have earned a tiebreak against C9 and could have controlled their own fate. SKT performing as expected isn't 'helping' C9 so much as it's 'not hurting' them. EDG underperforming against AHQ is what helped C9. Just funny how when it's NA that underperforms week 2 (which is a bit paradoxical since it always happens) then it's them underperforming, but when another region does poorly it's NA getting lucky.","replies":[{"poster":"Walmart Porn","date":"2017-10-15T16:50:01.210+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually 2 out of c9's 3 losses are to skt in the first place they only dropped one non skt match which is perfectly accecptable.
