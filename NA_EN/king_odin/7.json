Did you mean AD Talon?\n\nAnd none of this damage is dodgeable without a skill to physically dodge {{champion:105}} .    Saying you can flash/dash means you have to have one.  What if you're champ has no dashes and you flash? Fizz can just E to you or Ult and walk up to you without even him having to use a summoner spell. And what if he dashes and you flash then he just waits? What happens next time he dashes to you?  What if your dash was an ult on a longer cooldown than his dash? It's not as simple as \"Just dodge it!\" Or people like Ahri/Xerath/Ziggs/Ezreal would never see the light of day.\n\nI agree that nerfing the total damage on E would hurt AP fizz more than tank fizz (Tank fizz generally maxes W first for more damage over time while AP fizz maxes E for upfront burst/waveclear).  But a nerf of base damage and buff to ratios could actually _buff_ AP fizz depending on how it's done.\n\nI don't think {{champion:105}}  is comparable to {{champion:245}}  though, at least in the current meta. Ekko only has 1.5 dashes (Short range dash + blink) and has a massive AoE Stun/Shield with a re-do ult.  He is used primarily for zone control with his Q/W and for soaking damage then ulting to mitigate a large portion of it (as tank ekko at least) and is generally much safer than fizz (Retreating slow/stun/damage zones on chasing foes) whereas all of fizz's utility and damage, except his ult, come from going all in.  If anything I'd compare {{champion:105}}  to {{champion:120}}  since they fulfill similar roles these days of backline divers who can't do anything if they aren't in the enemy's face.  Though, I'd say pony is more of a true front liner and fish is a weird tricky skirmisher assassin.\n\nAlso, {{champion:105}}  is very sticky and disruptive compared to {{champion:39}} /{{champion:24}} .\n\n{{champion:105}}  is capable of getting to the back line very quickly without even expending a summoner spell by Q -> E -> Ulting the backline and, by the time ult completes, E is back up for escape.  With max CDR he has a 4.8s Intangibility/dash/wallhop/AoE Slow , an  AoE Slow/ Damage Amplifier Ult with mini knock up, and a 3.6s gap closer Q (And for Tank fizz a Speed up from Triforce and slow from BotRK).  \n {{champion:24}}  has just his Q and a delayed E but which cannot be reactivated to go in a different direction unlike fizz, not to mention Jax's E is on a longer cooldown and Jax doesn't build as much CDR due to HP/Lifesteal/SpellVamp synergizing with his kit better (Ult gives Armor/MR, most go for Randuin's for added stickiness or Gunblade for Stickiness + Damage + more defense on ult).  \n{{champion:39}} 's skills are single target, aside from her ult which generally isn't the main focus of your damage.  So each trade off something even if their single target damage might be slightly greater than fizz's.\n\nSorry for the rant, I just don't agree.","replies":[{"poster":"ccseancc143","date":"2015-08-19T07:27:51.711+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":6,"body":"He meant he would basically become Talon but, an AP version ya retard","replies":[{"poster":"Terchio","date":"2015-08-19T09:10:08.095+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":7,"body":">Many people say just \"increase the cd\" but doing that would make fizz an AP talon.\n\nOkay, I'll buy it.\n\n>since all of Fizz's damage is telegraphed/ delayed ( qss fizz ult, use zhonya) he'd be a weaker version of Ap talon.\n\nNah, I don't think so.

Spellblade scales off base AD, BoRK active scales off total health, and BoRK passive scales off current health. All of that is just fine, the only thing you could do to touch it would be to remove the damage amp from Fizz's Chum the Waters, but that counterplay is very much necessary for people to feel that assassin Fizz isn't such a mindless QWE machine. \n\nThe problem is that Riot keeps putting damage on items in addition to offensive stats. We don't need that. Champions who have perfectly balanced kits do not need bonus damage on top of bonus damage on top of their kits. Luden's Echo, Lich Bane, and Blade of the Ruined King add so much additional damage without really paying for it in cost of stat or slot efficiency. BoRK gives lifesteal and attack speed and a small amount of AD, and since all of those stats scale off each other, it's a very slot efficient item when you combine it with other marksman items that give more AD, more AS, or more crit individually. BoRK is a great all-rounder item that also adds damage to a champion's kit for no reason. Lich Bane gives 80 AP, mana, and move speed, and adds a 50% AP modifier to each of a champion's abilities, provided that champion can weave auto attacks between them. And then there's Luden's Echo...which adds 400+40% AP to a champion's poke or rotation. Unnecessary. \n\nAnd because these items add so much on their own, champions who build them feel unbalanced because their kits were just fine before they got so much extra damage from their items, and now people are calling for champions like Vayne, Fizz and Ahri to be nerfed simply because of their item builds.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sire Hippington","date":"2015-08-19T12:55:52.897+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd prefer to nerf his synergie with tanky builts a bit.\nBeeing very slippery is core to his identity as a character, and beeing squishy usually went with that, so nerfing E in any other way than nerfing the damage would hurt his identity.\n\ni think the easiest step to deal with rank fizz would be changeing his ult to only amp magical damage, so tank fizz looses  some all-in damage without really do much harm for ap-fizz.\nMaybe a lower basedamage on E or slightly lower base ad could help aswell.\n\nOr finaly nerfing BotrK, if a item that mostly offers AS+ a strong on-hit is staple on corki, who neither synergieses with AS nor On-hit, then it might be overtuned...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Desiderium","date":"2015-08-19T04:06:52.540+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"I think the issue here is not any part of his damage, but his E's design. \n\nBefore hitting him too hard, we should take it slow and do a few easy nerfs, like making his E's landing hitbox actually match the visuals.

Then you fail to point out that EVERY OTHER ASSASSIN in the game has some kind of ranged move on a basic ability.  And the ones that have pretty weak poke like Akali/Katrina have resets.  Zed/LB have instant port backs yet have good ranged poke.   Fizz no, he must go in melee to any damage unless he wants to use his ult for just poke.  The ridiculous assessment some people have about champions is hilarious.  Look at what other assassins have and then realize what Fizz is lacking and why he has the invulnerability and low cds in the first place.  He absolutely has to have the most all in damage compared to any other assassins because of his lack of healing (some get it inherit, ADs get it from lifesteal),  and his lack of poke (every other assassin has some or they are given resets to make up for their weaker poke like akali/kat) and his lack of range  (all of LB's spells are range and autos are range,  yet she can port around anywhere).   Most other assassins can poke down the enemy to 60% and then all in, NOT FIZZ, he must go into melee range to trade.  He also has mana constraints unlike a portion of the assassins who are manaless or have zero resources in the case of katrina.  Learn to actually assess the game correctly and then construct better feedback on the champion.  If tank Fizz is too strong, then nerfing his CDS are not the answer as AP fizz absolutely needs it based on his weaknesses.   Nerfing his base damage and upping his Ratios so that he actually MUST get some AP into his builds could work.  A tankier AP build should be able to work but not one with zero AP.","replies":[]}]}
