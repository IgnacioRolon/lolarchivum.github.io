It can go through terrain, yes, but it's not quite like a flash due to the charge up (flash is typically used more as a reaction). If you can get it charged up *then* decide to switch tracks from hitting someone to gtfo, then basically yeah. But it's not instant like Lee's ward hop (or his Q for initiating), and it takes Vi with her so it's not exactly a ranged skillshot. Not to mention her MS goes down while she uses it... there's a lot better mobile moves.\n\nIt's probably only allowed to be so powerful due to said drawbacks, at least.
