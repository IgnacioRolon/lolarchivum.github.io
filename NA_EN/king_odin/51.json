Early game ganks have been severely hurt because junglers can no longer pick up {{item:3706}} {{item:3715}} on first back since it now costs {{item:1039}} + 700 gold as opposed to {{item:1039}} + 450 Gold before.\n\n2. Hunters talisman feels non-existant on {{champion:32}} and I would think it would be most helpful on him but apparently I can&#039;t sustain enough mana to kill 2 camps without going oom. I would much rather have no talisman and my jungle item upon my first back rather than having to invest in 2 jungle items to finally build my {{item:3706}}. \n\n\n\nI know total gold has been increased and jungle monsters gold too, but with {{item:3709}} TOTAL COST 2250 gold &rArr; 2625 gold it hits junglers hard early game since they still don&#039;t get enough gold compared to laners and now I feel like junglers are even more behind especially Tank junglers with slow clears. {{champion:33}} {{champion:54}} {{champion:57}} {{champion:106}} ","replies":[{"poster":"MorganFreemanBot","date":"2015-11-11T21:47:45.758+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly, the jungle just feels bizarre now. I used to be able to clear the entire thing first go as Trundle with no issues. WInd up around 30-40% health with 1 pot left after clearing all of my camps and one (or both) of the crawlers.\n\nNow.. I routinely get near death on my first buff camp after the first small, and the second buff is dicey as hell. And beyond that is scary.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Droogzy","date":"2015-11-11T21:45:36.001+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"To make matters worse, it feels even more snowbally then ever before. \n\nSnowballing junglers were already difficult to deal with, but now its even worse with the changes in gold. If a jungler started snowballing, you could at least guarantee that you would finish your jungle item before it got too unbearable.\n\nWith this gold change, that's no longer the case.\n\nI just got off a game as Hecarim where I snowballed my early game and had my jungle item and a triforce completed in the time their Elise had even finished her jungle item because I forced her out of her jungle so early. She didn't even do anything wrong, her laners were just brain dead players. \n\nI'm a pretty experience jungler so I know all the mechanics and working of nearly every champion in the jungle scene, but I've never wrecked another jungler as hard as I did this game.\n\nPart of it is the gold change, the others are definitely the mastery changes.\n\nWith 4.5% MS from Quints, and the 5% (I think movement speed boost) from masteries, and 12 MS in brush and rivers, you can translate a kill so fast into a snowball now. It's really disgusting how fast you can move. Before I'd use to have to slink off after a kill because the other lane would generally know where I am, but now I can appear from mid lane to the top or bottom lane in 5 seconds with no problem at all. \n\nWas it fun? absolutely, but on the flip side, it's a little concerning to me the direction of the jungle right now.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talkrr","date":"2015-11-11T16:46:33.379+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, tough season for us Junglers.","replies":[{"poster":"Abyssphere","date":"2015-11-12T04:45:45.090+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Talkrr,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=dEexbisu,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-11-11T16:46:33.379+0000)\n>\n> Yeah, tough season for us Junglers.\n\nwtf {{champion:11}}","replies":[{"poster":"MAN OF INTELLECT","date":"2015-11-12T05:49:47.151+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ayyyy Critchance Yi Babyyyyyy","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Letzer","date":"2015-11-11T22:32:25.957+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think AP junglers got really hit hard at the early levels.\nHunter Talisman is a very bad item since % mana regen is very weak at lower levels.  \nThe refillable potions are worst (100 instead of 150 health regen). \nRemoved the sustain smite.\nI just don't understand how it helps bring variety to the jungle...\nOverall- this new season feels more like PBE than anything else... and just too much content at once. \nRiot will have a hard time keeping up with what they really need to change, to the point where I feel they won't be touching the game for a month, until people figure the new meta.","replies":[]},{"poster":"UberAffe","date":"2015-11-11T16:50:14.610+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Both nautilus and zac have easy clears ...","replies":[{"poster":"Naomi CoffeeGoat","date":"2015-11-11T17:13:57.547+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"He probably didn't take into account their \"sustain.\" Nautilus can soak up damage with his shield and Zac can heal off blobs.
