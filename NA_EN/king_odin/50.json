You won't have to worry about losing lane because an emergency happens and you ult in to help someone, he has decent ganks once he hits three and his regen actually makes it so you can gank with 3/4 health (Or even full if you go after a scuttle crab), and it works well with his ultimate since junglers are supposed to be watching the map anyway to look for trouble to stop and weaves to snatch. \n\nYou can stop things from going bad or snowball your lanes pretty nicely as long as no one starts feeding horribly from my experience so far and since you're a tank anyway you don't really need the kills to help everyone out.\n\nThat said, increased energy regen would be nice on him.

You kill your enemy by harassing them with Q and outsustaining them in a battle of attrition that you will win because shen is a massive meatwall early game (lategame he is also a big meatwall).\n\nThat being said, like Renekton, he has everything a top laner wants outside of those weaknesses.
