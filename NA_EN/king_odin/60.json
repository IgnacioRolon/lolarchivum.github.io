If they would nerf her bases and give good boosts to her ratios I feel like she'd be a lot healthier. Then again people don't seem to complain about full tank Mundo doing damage so I don't know.","replies":[{"poster":"Champion Skin","date":"2015-03-14T08:57:08.716+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Complaining about \"tank\" mundo dealing damage is so silly...\nIf he didn't deal damage... then what does he do?

With the way she's currently setup, it's going to be pretty tough to put her in a better spot while keeping both of her forms valuable.\n\nShe's in a bit of a weird spot. Right now she has both a stun and a targetted leap, a tankier + quicker form and a stronger + smaller hitbox form that she can change on an instant, so she's some kind of an assassin pseudo-tank with adequate cc, mobility, and the ability to whittle away tanky targets with her % damage. She's halfway between a jungle generalist and Irelia (better nerf). \n\nI think one way Riot could add not only more power-budget to her kit, but also more uniqueness and a bonus layer of difficulty (separating the inexperienced from the masters), would be to give her transformation a short (1 second?) channel. Doing so would ease the burden Riot currently has of trying to make her ability to switch at will with no costs not be a universal/on a dime change and gaining the benefits from it accordingly. Gnar's inability to directly control his transformations is what made room for more power in his kit and I think Elise could take a note from that too. The channel shouldn't be so long that it's debilitating, but enough to make it so that she should commit to a single form for a gank/duel unless she's able to buy herself the second of safety needed to switch.\n\nAn alternative way of transforming that keeps the same general idea I was going for: A Twitch-stealth like mechanic where she can move just fine for the duration and take damage, but she can't cast abilities until the 1 second transformation is complete.\n\nBecause I imagine there are plenty of veteran Elise players that hate the idea I just pitched, Riot could always do the standard \"make this targetted ability a skillshot so we can add range/damage/counterplay to her kit\" since admittedly a large portion of what damage she does deal is targetted. Or they could try to make her less of a generalist, making her human form more of the damage based assassin and the spider form more of the mobility/farming side, adjusting her numbers accordingly. Even then though, the ability to switch between those 2 suddenly seems like it's problematic.","replies":[{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2015-03-13T22:33:52.132+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Honestly, my main complaint about Elise's kit is the fact that they gave her %current and %missing health. This means she can build a magic pen item and then build straight tank and still have a bunch of damage from every occasion, which combined with her innate lifesteal and grapple mechanic, means she's really hard to kill.\n\nElise is a major contributor for my hatred of %hp damage.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Tourian","date":"2015-03-13T09:39:12.515+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"Because Riot hates Elise. Look at her patch history. Straight nerfs. Luden's is pretty nice to up her burst IMO, I'm having fun with it at least. Did you know her spider Q was originally a slow? Or that her Rappel was supposed to stun people that walked under it while she was mid-air? She needs more innate tank or CC honestly. That way she can BUILD more damage. There needs to be a bonus for having all of your spiderlings alive (bonus resists, fear on next SQ, etc. I'd really like to see a fear worked in there since spiders are like the number one phobia it makes sense.

Regular people don't play her so they dont buy skins so why would riot care? Same goes with Galio and Urgot except Urgot just got a buff which should show you just how low on the totem pole Elise is.\n\nAnd it's more of a conditional tankiness. If one spiderling dies she would lose it until she had max on the field again.
