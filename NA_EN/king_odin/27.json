Her Q in duels is cast directly on people almost always, you can occasionally last hit and harass with it but that requires really poor positioning on your opponents part.  W reactivating strut is useless unless it keeps strut active even when hit for its duration.  The E being buffed is nice but they could just do that without changing everything else and it still wouldn't make a difference.\n\nThe Ult already applied her impure shots it just didn't say it so thats not even a change, so there you have it she gains marginal in lane poke damage an increase in slow which we will have to wait and see the effects of (my guess is minimal but I don't want to be a pessimist), and 20% attack speed on W, which is slightly better than useless in lane and is okay in teamfights assuming you don't die because you are immobile.  To get these minor buffs she trades the ability to shred the healing of everyone on the enemy team in teamfights in half.\n\ntl:dr - at best her changes break even at worst it destroys the only niche she had.  She won't be picked any more often than she is already.  And it will only be people who like her since other carries do her AOE damage job better even after the changes while bringing their own niche.

You're going on many posts on the Boards about how it's a colossal nerf, but I don't see much information to back up your claim.\n\nMiss Fortune isn't weak, against the misconception that started out from the Community and due to her lack of popularity, she is pretty strong and according to the matrix and pretty much all sites, she does more than what the average ADCs are currently doing. While I wouldn't say winrates in general are ever reliable, she has maintained almost a 52% winrate since her last tweaks a very long time ago and it rarely changes besides like, 0.01%.\n\nMiss Fortune is an interesting ADC, her early game is probably the strongest, especially now in the PBE due to her Q reset+damage being essentially three auto attacks in one + her W's passive and Attack Speed. However one thing I see people missing is how powerful her mid game is. She's an amazing teamfighter and even stronger, she can hit the enemy backline and totally ignore tanks, her slow provides good utility, and while her passive was pretty useless in teamfights it's going to be much more efficient for repositioning or pursuing/escaping.\n\nMiss Fortune can outduel most ADCs, not all of them. Mostly ones like Vayne, Twitch, or Draven who are more so designed as ADCs who blow up a single target rather than teamfighters (aside from Twitch an Draven's ultimates). Miss Fortune also has better teamfighting than most ADCs, but again not all of them. This is due to her ultimate being able to hit backlines and her Double Up as well. She can hit tanks pretty hard since she does a lot of Physical and Magical damage and is of course an ADC, and she can blow up squishies fairly fast. While she isn't the best in teamfighting nor dueling, she is strong in both. I like this, there are ADCs who clearly outclass her in certain categories but she has a powerful mix of both dueling and teamfighting.\n\nHer main issues are her lack of mobility and fall off late game. Not her offense, which she excels at in the ADC category, and not her defense where she actually is a bit more tanky than most ADCs I believe. However her issues are not errors made by Riot, they exist because she NEEDS weaknesses like ALL champions. If Miss Fortune's late game was anywhere near as strong as her early game, she would simply be overpowered, and if all of her abilities could be casted while moving without her passive ever breaking off, she would again be overpowered. Imagine trying to run away from a Miss Fortune if her Q, E, and R had no cast times and her passive couldn't be broken. It would be ridiculous and unfair.\n\nAll-in-all, the removal of Miss Fortune's Grevious Wounds won't hurt her in compensation to what she's getting. It doesn't define her, and while it can make her unique in some eye's, that has no relevance to her strength.  It's a 2 second Grevious Wounds in exchange for noticeable buffs on her entire kit. She's a strong ADC, anyone who thinks otherwise can look at me. I'm a Silver, casual, scrub who can play against people far beyond my elo, and still go something like 20-3 with Miss Fortune. I'm not a god at the game, but I've mastered her to the point where I can carry games like this with Miss Fortune as easily if I would be playing someone like Vayne, Draven, Caitlyn, Ashe, etc, etc, etc. She's a strong champion, and there's relatively no evidence against that, or I've yet to see it, and she will just be made even stronger with her new buffs.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"DragoonRuin","date":"2015-07-09T19:55:35.426+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=King Odarth,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=hFs9Bpy8,comment-id=,timestamp=2015-07-09T15:51:22.185+0000)\n>\n> \"Impure Shots (W) Cooldown now 12 seconds at all ranks down from 16\n> Impure Shots (W) AS buff increased to 50/55/60/65/70% up from 20/30//40/45/50\n> Make It Rain (E) Slow changed to 40/45/50/55/60% from 25/35/45/55/65%\"\n> \n> That&#039;s really nice early game buffs to her, but she does nothing now that others ADC can&#039;t do.

But everything she does, some other ADC Does it better.  Grievous Wounds was something that she brought to the table that other ADC's didn't have.  Now, she doesn't have anything in her kit that some other ADC doesnt have, and have it better.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ravenhale","date":"2015-07-09T17:09:27.937+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Her Q, while buffed, is still not as good as Sivir's multi-hit skills. The buff also will only apply during the laning phase, since I doubt her Q will ever kill the tank standing in front of their APC/ADC.

Even Ashe's Volley deals more damage consistently, while marking all her minions for follow up crit shots.\n\nThis may improve her early game a little, but this was the skill I almost never leveled until nothing else was available.\n\nHer W was her AS steroid that also applied Grievous Wounds. Now it's going to be something similar to Draven's Blood Rush, since it gives her a momentary pair of free boots (maybe 10% MS, since strut only gives 25MS that builds, which won't happen in fight). Draven's gap closer/chase is 40% MS and isn't subject to being knocked out by AA. Caitlyn's is 400 Units instant. Graves is 425 Units instant. Vayne's is 300 Units Instant with a 30MS passive that can't be dropped.\n\nI guess it will be nice to have, but it feels like every other ADC with a gap closer does it better. I used to level this with her E, but depending on how the final numbers pan out, I may have to fall back on her only remaining strength.\n\nHer E. Thank heavens they shortened the duration without sacrificing damage. This was already a strong tool to pester melee champs and aggressive ADC. Oh, you have Alistair support. Heh heh. The only problem with this skill is it has a tendency to interrupt last hit patterns. The shorter duration should help.\n\nThis is also the reason why I prefer hybrid building Fortune, since it feels like the strongest tool in her kit. If this scaled off AD instead of AP, Fortune would be fierce.\n\nI don't think there is any ADC out there that has a better Damage/Slow. Graves is less everything with reduced vision. Vayne doesn't have one. Caitlyn's trap is easily avoided. Kog Maw's is less everything. Draven's Stand Aside scales off AD, so he is the only clear winner. But screw that. I'm not catching axes all game. I saw nothing in Lucien or Corki's kits that slow. Ashe doesn't count because her Ult has such a long cooldown.\n\nSo... I think her E is probably the new thing that she does better than just about any other ADC.\n\nI can only say ouch for the R. I've never considered Fortune's ult as a cleanup tool. Mobile champions can easily get out of range. I've always regarded it as the immediate followup to stun initiation by a teammate. Coupled with Black Cleaver, anyone caught in range just had armor shredded and health regen/healing halved since the R stacked her W. It also works wonders with Jarvain, Veigar, and any other champion that can hold a bunch of enemies in one place for 2 seconds.\n\nI don't know. Perhaps a team that gets trapped and hit with the nerfed Bullet Time is still going to all die without the Grievous Wounds. I certainly hope so, since that's what I pick Fortune for.

His E is VERY similar to MF's make it rain, however, the damage is instant, the slow area remains for 4 seconds instead of 2, applies grievous wounds still, scales off AD, and pops his W for aditional magic damage.
