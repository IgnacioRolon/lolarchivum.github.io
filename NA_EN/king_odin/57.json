Also some advice.","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"So you fed your laner 3 kills and you're 1/3 and he's 3/1. What thought process are you going through to think you can win ? I am jungler and I say please wait for a gank and you decide to engage whilst I am botlane then complain that I didn't gank or say \" You said you would gank wtf?\". \r\n\r\nSo firstly is it not possible for you to wait under tower and farm as best as you can? \r\nDo I not have other lanes I need to gank? \r\nWhy must you fight, why can't you farm?\r\nIf you're countered then play safe?\r\n\r\nI had a game where my top laner who was playing {{champion:92}}  I ganked her once then she got a kill after I left and we had burnt his flash. She went 1/6 because he tried over and over to 1 v 1 a Jayce, lost the 1 kill lead and gave Jayce 6 kills. I mean c'mon... That is ridiculous nonsense for someone who was in Gold 1 to be doing. Gold and Plat isn't actually a very good rank but at least use common sense? Anyhow we lost cause Riven went 0/9 and a Platinum Thresh/Caitlyn didn't know how to poke,farm or kite and fed Vayne 12 kills. At 20 Minutes Riven was 1/7, my mid laner {{champion:90}} didn't know how to ward so was always pushed and always got ganked. It was a hopeless game and yes I got fed up because Riven repeatedly actually went to 1 v 1 jayce when she was 1/7 and he was now 9/2. I ended up giving up at 25 minutes when we had all inhibs taken and ended up raging to the enemy team. They called me bad, and the reason I lost  and that I fed everyone. Which was actually good for me despite them not understanding since they were given a free match of LP. Yes I was angry and especially since I was in my promos but the worst thing to do is to rage to the enemy team. Just don't say anything. Just say nothing at all, they only will make you angrier and blame you for the loss which in turn makes you rant about how bad your team was and distracts you from the game.\r\n\r\nAlso if you are the enemy team please understand when someone ranting about trolling/playing terribly/feeding team mates and try and sympathise. Don't rub it in or trash talk it's literally like saying ez in a 4 v 5. Don't do it because you hate it when it's done to you or when your team mates feed there eyeballs out. If they are over the top tell them to chill or relax but don't say \" no wonder you all lost, you're so  toxic and such a bad player,\" when you say this it doesn't help and only makes it worse. I'm not justifying ranting or raging I am just saying try and be understanding and deal with the person as if they were on your team. If a Jinx goes 1/18 at 30 minutes and her jungler is raging about her being a complete waste of time then understand that you would also feel the same way if she was on your team.\r\n\r\nI am normally very tolerant and positive but it is hard when you get 3 bad teams in a row for your promos. \r\nSo just take it easy and ignore everyone or turn off /all which most people don't do because they often actually want to talk to the enemy team.","replies":[{"poster":"RogueWill","date":"2015-03-10T19:04:11.992+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lets see....\n{{champion:78}} Will dive you and kill you, hugging turret won't help.\n{{champion:80}} will also dive and kill you\n{{champion:114}} will dive and ult to kill you\n{{champion:58}} will dive, stun and kill you\n{{champion:122}} will pull you and kill you\n{{champion:31}} will dive and eat you\n{{champion:41}} will keep parleying you until you die or forced out of lane\n{{champion:126}} will start using gate and lower you down to the point he can dive with his hammer\n{{champion:86}} will dive, silence spin and ult you, you are dead\n{{champion:59}} will dive you once you are around half hp\n{{champion:75}} will ult and dive you\n{{champion:57}} see Nasus\n{{champion:27}} will ignore you and proceed to farm between turrets\n{{champion:62}} see Jarvan IV\n{{champion:106}} see Cho'Gath\n\nHug Turrent on top after you are 1/3 won't do anything for you.

I'm currently maiming top and when I get behind 2-3 kills I just go bot lane and get easy kills and go back top and teach the fuckwr a lesson.

When did I ever say that? Also there's a phase called laning phase it tends to last until around level 1 - 7. I've seen people feed 3 kills by level 5 which Riven did.  \n\nYou really shouldn't be roaming mid since the chances of you roaming mid and taking a tower are nearly impossible at level 5  or even level 7 unless there is no one defending. Also as Riven who has a shiled, stun, knockup and mobility farming under tower is fairly easy and if he dives it's rather easy to kill him or get his flash provided you use your cc. I don't see your point once again. I never argued to stay top like a fool and die. But if you are top and have a full hp tower why would you roam and lose cs, xp and also cause your mid laner or bot to lose xp since you're also taking it from them? Roaming can often push you even further behind especially if it is not successful. Also giving out a free tower isn't very smart if you're not getting anything from it. It takes away any protection you and your team had and now opens you up to even more ganks. Don't die to save the tower but don't give it away. \n\nAlso by the way someone who is 1/3 compared to 3/1 isn't actually as behind as you think. 3 kills is just 900 Gold which isn't even enough for a giants belt so I am wondering where you're getting your \"tanky bruiser\" from ?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Orbv","date":"2015-03-10T20:02:11.168+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I completely agree OP.\n\nI expect in 90% of my games to score 20% of my kills due to turret hits. It sounds bad, but when playing top lane, I always skirmish until about 1/3 health and then bait next to my turret. A bad player would simply see that predicament as a dead end with no hope. However, you need to remember what you're up against. \n\nIf you are against Melee with ranged engage and they have plenty of health to kill you, let them jump you and flash to the opposite side of your turret, simply run a circle around it while they take hits because they assumed the initial dive would get you. You should never blow flash unless it's for a deathless kill or late game team fight. Using it early game to escape simply means that you failed at playing lane, now play smart, what you should have done before hand.\n\nIf you are facing ranged consistent poke, just back, lose the CS and lose the turret. They are going to get it ANYWAY, your death will just add upon that.\n\nMany times players think that by standing next to their turret throwing off abilities, it will dissuade the enemy from diving and taking the turret as well. That almost never works. Losing a turret is not the worst case scenario. Losing a turret, dying and letting the enemy keep pushing is.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"S H A Y C 0","date":"2015-03-10T20:11:01.409+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So....what youre saying is, even though you have no chance to beat a Siberian Tiger in a 1 on 1 combat scenario...youd rather just fight him and give it your best instead of staying inside and trying your best to stay alive until help can arrive?\n\nYeah...thats why you died bro.\n\nSecondly, you list all these champions and how they can just kill you at will as if you picked the only champion in league of legends with ZERO abilities!!!! Do you have absolutely nothing you can do to discourage the dive? have you no escapes whatsoever? no sustainability????? WTF did you pick this useless champ for???
