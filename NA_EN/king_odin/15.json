The problem is they can't discount the skin down to 1820 because so many people bought it already in spite of the fact that it really isn't worth the 3k it is sold at when compared to newer skins.\n\nIn short Riot refuses to change any skin beyond the scope of their established selling point at any point in time and will never change a price after the fact due to backlash of those whom will claim it unfair for the ones who have/haven't bought the skin yet.\n\nIt's not fair for the newer players buying more expensive ryze and its not fair for the older players who paid almost twice as much if they were to adjust prices. The only alternative is an account checking RP compensation, but that's essentially giving away free money consider the RP literally = real life currency.
