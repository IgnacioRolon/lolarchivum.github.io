But god damn it he is so useless in this meta. He has no gap closer, low dmg output, worst skillshot in the game. I am not saying he is UP but i think that he is useless in this league of dash. His shield is useless unless you build mana. The only good skill is his trademark which is his ulti that only works on bots or people who have bot level tier.\n\nAny ideas on how to make him more viable? His early game and late game are shit already. Don't you think that he needs a slight rework?","replies":[{"poster":"RTX Warnoise","date":"2014-11-27T05:55:32.611+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Now playing skarner is a frustrating experience man. i feel so underwhelming","replies":[]},{"poster":"Venowolf","date":"2014-12-30T18:36:10.824+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"His W need some change's to make feel more like a unostoppable tank:\n\n60/70/80/90/100 (+ 8/9/10/11/12 % TOTAL of Skarner health) and also make's some kind of tenacity buff. some like this: While the shield persists, Skarner gains 15% of tenacity.\n\nI'l agree with the increase of the duration of his passive stun ,turn into 0.75/1/1.25 feels better, now that everyone have acces to the tenacity elixir the stun duration need some review IMO.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PoE00dpWDk","date":"2014-11-27T08:48:50.827+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think there are two changes that could be made to Skarner to really help him out without pushing him into OP territory. The first would be his E its low damage, decent slow, low speed, and low range. Little about this ability is any good other than the fact it adds a mark to your target. An increase in its range would make it so much more usable for ganks, escapes, etc without really changing its impact on targets.  Another change that could also be done to his E with the range buff would be to have it pierce targets, but I think that might be to much. The second buff to him that I would love to have happen is to have his passive stun be buffed, ether by making it a flat 1 sec stun at all levels or just buffing the numbers at all stages to something like .75/1/1.25.  Currently at the early and most of the mid game his passive is all windup and little reward. It just seems strange they do a whole rework around this new passive only to have it be so underwhelming to pull off, though I do love to hear that ring, pure music. \n\nThe  thing that really gets me is that these sort of changes are just number changes. So many other champs go patch after patch getting tweak this way, Skarner post rework one nerf than out of sight out of mind.","replies":[{"poster":"RTX Warnoise","date":"2014-11-27T11:14:21.211+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What skarners desperately needs is not only  a change to his E but to his W as well. Getting to melee range to an ADC or a caster in this meta is very hard. So to make up for his lack of gap closer ( dont tell me about his shitty ms shield please) he either needs a hard cc that helps him getting closer or buff shield to reduce incoming cc by 15% to make him at least more viable.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"RTX Warnoise","date":"2014-11-27T05:12:29.948+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean i dont know what is skarner supposed to be: CC machine? no Damage Dealer?
