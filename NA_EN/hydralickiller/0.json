Fill doesn't mean random, fill means you're going to fill in a role where needed, and it just so happens that support is more often needed than anything else. They've been working on some things to make support a more attractive role, but thus far nothing major has been done. New support item changes seem fun though.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2017-04-18T15:20:47.817+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They tried offering a position-veto fill (basically \"anything but x\") on some servers early this season, and it led to significantly longer queue times and support shortages. So they scrapped it.","replies":[]}]}
