Since there is no way to tell how close you are to the next level, it will seem like you are making no progress. When no progress seems to be made, people tend to give up on the idea. Better to show the progress (no matter how slow) to encourage people to continue to do well and realize that there is an end goal.  \n\nI love this idea of the honor system and I think it will do a lot for the community, but it is a bit frustrating to be getting all these honors and not seeing that they are doing anything. The black box you have set up at the moment makes it seem like you don't have it actually set in place yet (where you can actually level up), and I am loosing interest fast (as well as many others I know).","replies":[{"poster":"NickLTY","date":"2017-09-06T21:09:21.009+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A visible way to shows the progress is super important.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Aitikian","date":"2017-07-17T03:27:08.905+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ccubed,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=YTA6graq,comment-id=00000003,timestamp=2017-07-16T18:21:03.748+0000)\n>\n> Just an idea, but that may actually hurt you guys in the long run.

I don't know because I cant see my progress so people wont want to change their behavior if they are bad for a while until they go down in honor.","replies":[]}]}
