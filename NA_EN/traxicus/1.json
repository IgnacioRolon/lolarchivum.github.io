On death, champions leave their essence behind for 3 minutes, which Jovah can right-click to perform his burial rites on over 2 seconds. Successfully burying a champion grants small, permanent stat increases &ndash; 5 Ability Power, 10 Health, and 10 Mana, and also restores 10% of Jovah&#039;s maximum mana. Jovah gains bonus movespeed towards unburied essence.\n \n _Q_: **Will o&#039; Wisp** &ndash; _Costs 50 / 55 / 60 / 65 / 70 mana, 7/6.5/6/5.5/5 second cooldown._\n Jovah casts a will o&#039; wisp to a distant targeted location (2500 range), dealing 40 / 65 / 90 / 115 / 140 (+40% AP) magic damage to enemies it passes through, flying slower the longer it travels, and losing 10% of its damage after each hit, extinguishing after six hits. It remains at its destination for up to 10 / 12 / 14 / 16 / 18 seconds, granting a small amount of vision, and will chase enemies that come near it, dealing 30 / 55 / 80 / 105 / 130 (+20% AP) magic damage to the enemy it hits over a 3 second duration. The wisps will remain for an additional .2 seconds for each burial rite Jovah has performed, but Jovah can only have 3 Wisps active at a time.\n \n _W_: **Spirit Guardians** &ndash; _Costs 55 mana, 22 second cooldown._\n Jovah summons two obedient wolf spirits that follow alongside him for 8 seconds. An enemy spell projectile that hits a wolf spirit while they guard Jovah will be absorbed, but the wolf will be destroyed. While active, Jovah&#039;s autoattacks will sic a wolf after his target &ndash; the wolf has 475 (+ Jovah&#039;s bonus movespeed) speed and will chase for up to 3 seconds. Once in range, it attacks with a chilling howl in a cone, dealing 55 / 80 / 105 / 130 / 155 (+60% AP) and slowing enemies by 30/40/50/60/70% for 1 second, or 1.5 seconds against fleeing enemies.\n \n _E_: **Rejuvenating Spring **&ndash; _Costs 65 / 75 / 85 / 95 / 105 mana, 21/20/19/18/17 second cooldown._\n Passive: Jovah gains 10/15/20/25/30% bonus movespeed while he has least one Spirit Guardian active, slowly increasing to double the speed if Jovah remains out of combat.\n Active: Jovah imbues a small patch of ground with healing properties, removing Grievous Wounds from allies inside on cast and restoring up to 10 / 22 / 34 / 46 / 58 (+15% AP) health per second to allies inside for 4 seconds, decreased by half if Jovah is not within 300 range. Rejuvenating Spring is visible to enemies in the fog of war or in brush.\n \n _R_: **Great Oak** &ndash; _Costs 100 mana, 115 / 100 / 85 second cooldown._\n Jovah summons a mighty oak at a targeted location, knocking away enemies, dealing 100 / 175 / 250 (+50% AP) magic damage, and forming a wide pillar of terrain. The tree&#039;s protective roots spread outwards, reducing damage allies standing on them take from non-turret sources by 15 / 25 / 35%. The oak is treated as a structure for abilities like Teleport or the Point Runner passive, and remains until the next cast of Great Oak, but can be damaged by both spells and attacks. The oak has Jovah&#039;s total HP and gains armor and magic resist equal to his for each allied champion near it. Champions that die on the great oak's roots have their spirit absorbed by it, automatically granting Jovah the bonuses from his burial rites.\n\nStats:\n Attack Damage: 50 - 102  . . . . . . . . |   Health: 520 - 1745\n Attack Speed: 6.25 (+0% - 26.2%). | HP5: 5.4 &ndash; 14.8\n Armor: 21.9 &ndash; 81.4. . . . . . . . . . . .  . .| Mana: 321 - 995\n Magic Resist: 30 . . . . . . . . . . . . .  . .| MP5: 6 &ndash; 19.6\n Move Speed: 330 . . . . . . . . . . . . . .| Range: 525 (Ranged)\n\nImportant to note: Jovah&#039;s base Health and Mana at 18 are relatively low. Without performing his burial rites, he falls off towards the lategame. This represents the obligation to duty a druidic caretaker has, and is supposed to feel like a chore, but one he can earn a lot of power from doing.\n\nJovah is a roaming-based support that offers good vision control and zone-based safety to his allies. Safe in the wilds, Jovah sends Will o&#039; Wisps to watch for dangers, and summons spectral wolves to protect his old and frail body. The wolves escort him across the map as he recovers the corpses of fallen champions, bound by duty to care for their essence. If ambushed, Jovah summons his Great Oak, shrouding him and nearby allies in a protective aura, and providing a semi-permanent safe zone for his team.\n\nVisually, Jovah is similar to Radagast from LoTR, speaking in eccentric quibbles and usually moving in a stiff and elderly manner, but with his Spirit Guardians or Great Oak active, takes on a youthful vigor. His Will o&#039; Wisps are graceful baubles of light, moving delicately but singing unwary opponents with incandescent flame. His Rejuvenating Spring causes the land to brim with life, enhanced by his proximity, as toadstools and saplings spring from  luminescent ground. His oak stands so tall the leaves are above the camera, but the light filtering through the canopy shimmers over the roots in a magical dance.","replies":[{"poster":"BeautifulBlanket","date":"2015-04-20T20:19:22.451+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, for such a big fantasy game...how is LOL missing a basic wizard?","replies":[{"poster":"SpecterVonBaren","date":"2015-04-21T05:40:59.279+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:45}} What's black and blue, and is about to show you the definition of WIZARD?!","replies":[{"poster":"Snake Town","date":"2015-04-21T17:46:38.477+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"A CASTER MINION!!!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ancestor007","date":"2015-04-21T13:54:52.993+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Definitely not you, wimp!\n\nEdit: It's a joke!","replies":[{"poster":"handstandpushup","date":"2015-04-21T14:31:10.989+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Be nice, you never know.

My only concern with his kit is the potential for his ultimate to just become a non-damage turret for the enemy to push through. Given that it can reduce damage taken by a whopping 1/3 at max rank, I would recommend limiting the duration to something like 20-30 seconds. Even azir's turrets can't last forever and drain by themselves --perhaps that could be implemented to your ultimate.","replies":[{"poster":"Traxicus","date":"2015-04-21T02:32:11.852+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That compliment means a lot to me - thanks! I actually applied for an internship with the champion design team last November, but I didn't get it. This is one of the concepts I've made since, and hearing that is really nice :)\n\nRegarding your suggestion - the way I see it, Jovah creates the Great Oak when and where he needs it, which either ends up being 1) smack dab in the middle of enemy territory or 2) somewhere else. If it's in an area under their control, they should have no trouble destroying it after the teamfight (it loses all resistances without allies nearby), and if it's not in their area, they should be able to avoid picking a teamfight there.\n\nThe obvious exception to the above is Dragon & Baron pit, and I think i'd have to make a special case that either Jovah cannot create the tree where they appear, or they destroy it if it's there when they spawn, mostly to avoid weird terrain collision.\n\nI don't think it should drain on its own, because unlike Azir's turret it poses no direct threat to enemies. It's like the scuttlecrab shrine, in that it provides a buff for one team without really affecting the other.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"2OmnkAKGi9","date":"2015-04-20T16:51:55.000+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really, really enjoy the idea of this camp.

Champions dying isn't something that should happen constantly, therefore this passive would be pretty weak if that was the case. Large monsters, on the other hand, do die often.\n\nThe wisp seems like a really cool concept.\n\nThe wolves seem a bit faster than needed, but that's fine. I feel like a bite of some sort would be more fitting than a howl, however, but go with what you like.\n\nRevealing your allies is not necessary. All you need to do is reveal the spring. If the spring is revealed, they could easily think that your allies are waiting on there to heal, they don't need a giant red flag to say so.\n\nThe ultimate seems like a very nice touch, however is there a limit to how many can be summoned? I notice that it could be something without this, but hey, you never know.\n\n\nOverall nicely done!

I'll change that now.\n\n>Is there a limit to how many can be summoned?\n\nYes, you get one at a time. Casting Great Oak removes the current one, if it's still standing.\n\nFor the wolves, the speed is only 25 higher than a Maokai sapling (which should be slower than a wolf), and the chilling howl attack was to differentiate it from the saplings/spiderlings. It wouldn't make much sense to have a wolf explode.\n\nThanks for the feedback!","replies":[{"poster":"ChaosThief","date":"2015-04-22T18:49:37.974+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No problem!

I like his passive, and I think you could make the champion tighter by finding ways to work more interactions with burial rites into his kit beyond linear stat powerup.  Some starting suggestions:\n\nPeople that die in the R tree roots are auto-buried.  This is a small bonus, but one that I think the kit appreciates in the midst of combat.\n\nReplace Healing spring with something of similar functionality, but more interesting and less sustain oriented.  An idea I had:\n\nDew of the First Dawn\n\nActive : Releases a cloud of infused dew over an area. This dew clings to allies, giving them a short duration (3-4 sec) buff that heals them instantly upon taking damage, and dispels/prevents the application of grievous wounds for the duration.\n\nPassive: Gains bonus movement speed when moving towards potential burial rites targets, will o wisps, and oak trees.\n\nFinally, will o wisps become fortified by his connection to the natural spirit, and gain persistence duration based on his stacks of burial rites.  I'd say about 0.3-0.5 seconds persistence per stack.  This helps establish his wisps as more than a damage tool, allowing him to create a temporary network of speed boost as and when he needs it, as opposed to a more generic speed out of combat passive.\n\nGood concept, plenty of people have attempted it but so far only you have managed to not make it repellent.","replies":[{"poster":"Traxicus","date":"2015-04-21T13:20:38.818+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the feedback! I wanted to avoid making a similar system to Bard's meeps, where every X burials he gets effect Y, but I agree that linear stat scaling is boring. I'm not sure I like the movespeed towards wisps (Then he would just be casting wisps forward to get movespeed instead of activating the wolves, which are thematically what serve as his escorts), but I do like the movespeed towards essence that needs to be buried.\n\nI like the R change - I'll add that in!\n\nThe heal you mentioned is interesting... I think a Rioter would say that a heal that only works if you take damage is counterintuitive and feels bad, but I kind of like the \"magical dew that clings to wounded allies\" idea. Perhaps it works like Ziggs' E, but allies pick up dew bubbles to heal? Maybe it scales off of their missing health, being very weak if they're at 50%+ and quite effective if they're low? Or maybe the dew applies a heal over time, and allies should wait between picking them up to maximize the effect?\n\nFor your last idea, I want to cap the number of wisps at 3 just so his vision capability isn't absurd, so I don't think he'd have a \"network\" of them. If it's not clear, I wanted to give them huge range; think Kalista's sentinels, but they travel through walls and move really slow as they get further out.","replies":[{"poster":"Grann Brigitte","date":"2015-04-21T14:48:21.988+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not saying they should go above a 3 wisp cap- just they last longer when placed as the game progresses and the passive stacks up.  The pattern of play intended with the movespeed moving towards a wisp is to make him slightly safer when he needs to get to a dangerous corpse- by leaving wisps in a trail, he enjoy his movement speed bonus both moving to the corpse and moving away from it.  It lets him have his passive in two directions, for a limited time, and based on his forethought as opposed to running super fast everywhere all the time.  \n\nI'm just spitballing with the dew, it was 5 am and I was trying to think of something.  Your idea of a healing ziggs minefield is pretty good.  Really all I want to see from the ability is something which won't invite players to sit in lane sustaining and rewards them more for moving around the map and skirmishing. Maybe make the healing portion relatively weak, but it provides another buff that tells allies its time to get in there and trade.","replies":[{"poster":"Traxicus","date":"2015-04-21T18:17:32.968+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yep, I've added a note that each burial adds .2 seconds to the wisp, but it's still capped at 3.\n\nThe way I look at it, if the corpse is in a dangerous spot, it should be really hard to get safely. Think Thresh's souls - he often has to give up on them if they're in a dangerous spot and he doesn't have his lantern.\n\nFor the heal, I'm sticking with the healing AoE for now because it's really a defensive, turtling ability - the ability that decides the engage is his W, with the wolves that chase.
