Supports (and some junglers) would like that, I&#039;m sure.\nHere are some ideas:\n\nSentinel&#039;s Vigilance:\nYour ward cap increases by 1. Gain a small amount of armor and magic resist, scaling with your level, for each green and/or pink ward you have active. The resistances do not apply until six seconds after placing a ward, and last until they expire or are destroyed.\n\nBanisher of Shadows:\nWhen you place a ward, for a few seconds it provides greatly increased vision range and highlights hidden enemies, as well as granting you a shield for a few seconds (on a long cooldown).\n\nScouting Sprite:\nYour champion is followed by a small glowing orb that has the same sight radius as you, and trails behind you at around a 2-second delay. If you use the last charge in your Sightstone, it disappears and replenishes one charge, reappearing once you recall. If you die while it&#039;s active, it transforms into a blue ward.\n\nSwiftrunner's Guidance: (inspiration credit to vSynthesize)\nWards you place last 15% longer, and generate a buff over a period of time (scales down with level, somewhere around 30-10 seconds) that surrounds them with a windy circle. When an ally walks into the circle, the buff is consumed, imbuing  them with a burst of movement speed. This wind is faintly visible to enemies.\n\nProphet of Retribution: (inspiration credit to The Djinn)\nYour wards are protected by a shield that absorbs the damage from one attack. This shield recharges after 20-5s (scales down with level). An enemy that breaks this shield suffers an 80% slow that decays over 3 seconds, and is revealed for that duration.\n\nI know these are pretty niche, but I think broadening the options of keystone masteries to include vision effects are a great way to make the support role more dynamic and fun. Feel free to give feedback on these ideas and contribute your own!","replies":[{"poster":"Zielmann","date":"2016-02-09T15:41:52.531+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a support main, I would absolutely love something that either increased my ward cap or increases the max charges on sightstone items by one (or both?)\n\nWith sightstone only having 3 wards, I feel like it's difficult to really advance vision without a substantial amount of help from your team. They keep making these vision changes with the thought of spreading the vision responsibility across the team. It's great in theory, but no amount of changes they make will actually get your allies to help enough with warding in silver...","replies":[{"poster":"Traxicus","date":"2016-02-09T15:46:39.772+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I totally agree with you. Spreading vision responsibility across the team is a big reason the support role feels a bit bland now.

For example, i'd really miss windspeakers for Janna and Nami (my favorite two supports atm). It actually feels really rewarding to run that, to me.\n\nWhat I'd almost prefer is a Tier 4 mastery in either cunning or resolve that only increases sightstone ward count by 1. This way, even if you feel required to take it as support, you don't feel like you're losing out on another major point of power. It would also enable others who utilize sightstone (some junglers) to access that mastery without sacrificing their preferred keystone as well.","replies":[{"poster":"Traxicus","date":"2016-02-09T16:26:06.283+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, it's definitely a weird position to be put in for trade offs, but when you have to sacrifice heal/shield potential, you can make the vision capabilities that much stronger.

Have Wards grant a bonus once they have been active for more than 15 or 20 seconds. When you move out the case of using them in combat, although you do potentially encourage putting them in more defensive positions. Not necessarily a bad thing.\n\n\n> Does it?

I would also definitely need an internal cool down, which could get frustrating if you needed to save the ability but also need to ward somewhere else. Maybe power up the ability, but make it only work for vision wards? Then raise your vision Ward cap specifically to 2.\n\n\n> Maybe? Essentially the goal was to raise the charge cap on sightstone items, but in an interesting and interactive way. I think near-permanent vision into surrounding brush would be OP though. Remember, unless you have a sightstone and you use all its charges, this orb is always a few feet behind you.\n\nWell, it would only be vision into a bush that you gone into, so you still have to expose yourself to danger. I was imagining it as something like echo, where after X seconds it would eventually move to your position, so you couldn't get permanent vision.\n\n> Yeah, maybe it'd manifest as a windy circle that would be visible to enemies?

Maybe it could be some kind of charge system where, once every minute or two, you can place a regular ward at blue trinket range (or something close)?\n\nHm. Could work. The goal was to be less interactive though: closer to wind speakers blessing than most of the other masters. It helps you do what you are supposed to do more efficiently: in this case, warding and getting back to position.\n\n> I'd be hesitant about ward effects with direct offensive uses. Other than that glitch where you can trap people by tower with blue trinket (think that was fixed) there's very little case for this in-game. I'd feel that encourages poor ward use way more than the Sentinel's Vigilance.\n\nThe reason I like this one better than sentinels vigilance is because this has a clearer use case. It's hard to tell in advance when a minor defensive boost will save you, but it's easy to tell when a zoning slow will be a big impact to your team. That said, you may be correct that an offensive ward use is not the best idea.","replies":[{"poster":"Traxicus","date":"2016-02-09T17:49:04.538+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Have Wards grant a bonus once they have been active for more than 15 or 20 seconds.\n\nI think we're vying for the same point here - it's not clear the way I wrote it but I was thinking the resistances would not take effect until three seconds after you place the ward, and would then last until they expire or are destroyed.\n \n> Well, it would only be vision into a bush that you gone into, so you still have to expose yourself to danger. \n\nI guess that's sensible - and yeah, it'd basically be an Ekko clone, but only on maybe a 2 second delay.","replies":[{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2016-02-09T17:54:03.162+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Traxicus,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=H8VxIWtk,comment-id=0006000000000000,timestamp=2016-02-09T17:49:04.538+0000)\n>\n> I think we're vying for the same point here - it's not clear the way I wrote it but I was thinking the resistances would not take effect until three seconds after you place the ward, and would then last until they expire or are destroyed.\n\nOh.

This effect is disabled for wards placed close to allied towers.\n\n*Might allow for interesting situations where you use a ward to heal up your team before a fight, or where you can create gameplay objective in lane by using a Vision Ward defensively.*\n-----------------------\n**SUPERB CLARITY:** Wards you place have a small triggering radius around then. If an enemy champion passes directly through this radius, their location is pinged on the map and they are *revealed* to your team for 6 seconds.\n\n*Rewards unexpected or skillful ward placement, and perhaps makes melee champions hesitant about clearing even known wards.*","replies":[{"poster":"Traxicus","date":"2016-02-10T05:05:55.555+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, thanks!

Since it's an effect that won't happen nearly as often as most keystones, how about something with a biiit more power:\n> \n> All wards you place gain a shield that protects them from one attack. When an enemy breaks this shield, they are revealed for 3s and suffer an 80% slow that decays over 3s. (edit: maybe slow strength and/or duration should scale with level?)\n\nHm. That's not a bad feature -- I'd even be willing to consider making the shield recharge after X seconds, to really make people think about their approach, but that might be over the top.\n\nI'm also tempted to call it **EVIL EYE** or **VISIONS OF RETRIBUTION**.","replies":[{"poster":"Traxicus","date":"2016-02-11T00:19:12.202+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry it took me a while to get back to this, crazy day -\n\nHow about Prophet of Retribution?
