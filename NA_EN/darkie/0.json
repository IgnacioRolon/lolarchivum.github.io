I live in a rough part of Scotland and all around me you have insults thrown at each other as a greeting, the bigger the insult the more welcomed you are to see someone, but when I go into a game online I dont put a filter on how I type, its the way I am, and why do I have to act like someone im not when in a game......\r\n\r\nSorry for the rant, this is really just me getting annoyed at the out-of-no-where honor lock but If i had to ask a question it would be: What is the line between toxic and someone taking advice/conversation as an insult in this game?","replies":[{"poster":"Big Bad Dog","date":"2017-10-18T02:04:25.747+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"unless its a 2week ban you will get rewards as long as you play enough games to remove your chat restriction","replies":[{"poster":"DarKie","date":"2017-10-18T17:14:47.187+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"so even though im locked at honor 1 ill still get the gold border?","replies":[{"poster":"Big Bad Dog","date":"2017-10-18T23:21:42.612+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"As we announced in August, certain players are ineligible for this seasonâ€™s rewards:\n\n- Players with bans or chat restrictions active when the season ends.\n- Players issued a ban of seven days or more after 8/22/2017.\n- Players banned for boosting during the 2017 season.\nPlayers who experience fraud-related or erroneous bans will still be eligible.\n\n\nhttp://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/page/2017-ranked-season-ends-november-7","replies":[{"poster":"DarKie","date":"2017-10-19T22:18:10.376+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"so does the punishment count as active while your honor level is locked or does it purely mean when you have the restrictions? thanks for the info tho!","replies":[{"poster":"Big Bad Dog","date":"2017-10-20T01:27:19.273+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"while the restrictions are active i believe","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Tenth Leper","date":"2017-10-18T19:09:38.556+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am sad to hear you might miss the Graves skin. If there is ever a victorious bard or fiddle skin and I miss it I might just cry.\n{{sticker:cass-cry}} \n\nConcerning your language related punishment, I suppose it might very well be a misunderstanding on the part of your teammates. Where I live it is uncommon to be sworn at, so when someone does curse at you it is usually seen as a verbal attack. Usually in game there is not very much time to type so it can be especially difficult to decipher a person's tone from the limited text. This leads to many wife's jokes and missed sarchasm, but also some people seeing insults where none were intended.\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}} \n\nI hope your account gets back in good graces soon, and thanks for reminding me to be careful of how I say things.\n{{sticker:vlad-salute}}","replies":[{"poster":"DarKie","date":"2017-10-18T21:30:02.127+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"oh my, If i missed a victorious bard skin i dont know what I would do with my life... probably cry...a lot","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Telephone Booth","date":"2017-10-18T02:38:37.113+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's awesome man. I love affectionately insulting people as a show of friendship. Don't change. However, when on league, you honestly do have to tone it down. You gotta strip yourself of your personality, for the sake of keeping your account safe. The line is very blurred, but keeping your account safe actually is quite simple, you just gotta steer clear of that line. Don't ride it. \n\nYou can give advice, as long as you don't throw in anything negative with it. Phrase it as strictly what you think they should do (not what they shouldnt do! In other words, \"stop dying\" \"dont go in 1v5\" ...that shit is obvious, and not real advice) and then move on. Dont hound em about it, dont bring it up again. If they respond negatively, don't even speak to them again. \n\nThe people that get in trouble for \"giving advice\" are those that continuously rag on people, and then when it's met with hostility, they take that as open season to insult the person, and it turns into a flame war.
