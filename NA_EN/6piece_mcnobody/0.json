As Jhin ADC, my support Ali DC'd. Short after, both me and our Quinn (my friend) DC'd as well.\r\nWhen I DC, I usually quit the match then rejoin to see if it helps. So I did that.\r\n\r\nInstead of the button to rejoin the match, the whole client was available. As if the match was completely over.\r\nAgain, the match went on less than 10 minutes at this point. Everyone was in the match, so it definitely wasn't /remake. And far too soon for an early surrender.\r\nMy friend, our Quinn, said that his whole client was available after he DC'd as well.\r\n\r\nI've never had this happen before. \r\nAny ideas?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-05T20:43:26.930+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahhhh it sounds like that game must have crashed entirely for everyone in that game. It's pretty rare, but when it does happen everyone is booted from the game, they don't get any penalties for leaving, and everyone can requeue immediately after. No worries, you're free to start up another game if it happens again.","replies":[{"poster":"6Piece McNobody","date":"2017-09-08T20:05:41.959+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My friend and I did requeue immediately after.
