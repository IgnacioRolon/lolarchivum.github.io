This was durring, and shortly after his dash had occurred. His items included: Fleasheater, Typhoon Claws, Dead Man&#039;s Plate, Trinity Force, Hexdrinker, and Mercury Treads. Though this only happened twice during the game, and there were plenty of times where I was able to stun him, I was really annoyed that this happened, and it lead to multiple deaths of not only myself but my team. I just wanted to bring this up in the forums to see if anyone else was having the same trouble.","replies":[{"poster":"afgd7RL7UD","date":"2015-08-06T21:12:50.796+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Xin's E sometimes allows him to go through skill shots.
