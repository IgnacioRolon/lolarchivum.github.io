I will give an example. I really dislike playing with rek'sai in my team at the moment. not really because i think it is op etc, but because I don't really know how to fit him into teamfights, and what he does best etc... so I would vote for him to be banned first. it might be he won't get banned, but at least my team has realized that i don't really like/understand rek sai. it can be used as a form of communication...","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"iamthegoatofwar","date":"2015-01-08T21:41:27.373+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think every one should just get a ban.","replies":[]}]}
