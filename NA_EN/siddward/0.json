I wasn&#039;t even talking to them but my friend darius in top lane. THEN SPAMMED ALL CHAT AND REGULAR CHAT TO REPORT ME. I GET MUTED FOR NO REASON. Honestly I thought they were joking because it was just full out lies, I didn&#039;t even flame them once the hell? The first part about me being better was with the enemy yasuo and telling him to wait in fountain because he asked if we were remaking (annie was afk and I was told she was RC so i tried to buy her time) who i&#039;m sure didn&#039;t report me. Cmon how&#039;s that fair for 25 game mute? I wish they could see the whole chat is there a way. IF there is, I&#039;m pretty sure it would expose the weak autoban system.\r\ndevilplaytoy: need mecha khazix asap\r\ndevilplaytoy: ayye best leahs na\r\ndevilplaytoy: how ur windhisled past me and it still blocks w\r\ndevilplaytoy: omg\r\ndevilplaytoy: nice\r\ndevilplaytoy: yah just wait in fountain\r\ndevilplaytoy: well damn\r\ndevilplaytoy: i think its gg\r\ndevilplaytoy: i never get a challenge anymore\r\ndevilplaytoy: by who\r\ndevilplaytoy: ur not a challene i was half hp no f\r\ndevilplaytoy: no i wasnt\r\ndevilplaytoy: because all my mains got banned\r\ndevilplaytoy: what attitude\r\ndevilplaytoy: im not toxic anymore\r\ndevilplaytoy: i mena i did get mute for telling someone stop dying\r\ndevilplaytoy: no vision in tri is life\r\ndevilplaytoy: my b\r\ndevilplaytoy: was thinking about something\r\ndevilplaytoy: i dont get how gragas cant camp this guy\r\ndevilplaytoy: %%%%%$ be like build GA\r\ndevilplaytoy: yOO CHILL\r\ndevilplaytoy: thats not with ER\r\ndevilplaytoy: and im black\r\ndevilplaytoy: i find it racially abusive u r telling me not to say something im called\r\ndevilplaytoy: im reporting yalll\r\ndevilplaytoy: im actually gonna get perma banned\r\ndevilplaytoy: sigh\r\ndevilplaytoy: work hard play hard\r\ndevilplaytoy: the auto ban system actually works like that\r\ndevilplaytoy: and it will ban me for lies\r\ndevilplaytoy: yea\r\ndevilplaytoy: i got two mains banned\r\ndevilplaytoy: yea it does\r\ndevilplaytoy: i posed it on the forums\r\ndevilplaytoy: i got muted for telling someone not to die\r\ndevilplaytoy: but it wont ban like that\r\ndevilplaytoy: i can report for griefing\r\ndevilplaytoy: you can;t\r\ndevilplaytoy: its not filtered\r\ndevilplaytoy: you choose to play unfilitered\r\ndevilplaytoy: yea before a actual BAN tribunal can read the chat\r\ndevilplaytoy: and can make the decision to ban YOU for griefing\r\ndevilplaytoy: but im not being racist\r\ndevilplaytoy: how is that being racist\r\ndevilplaytoy: because it offends you im racist?\r\ndevilplaytoy: yo\r\ndevilplaytoy: no, what you mean\r\ndevilplaytoy: you should watch sjw and blm hypocrisy and\r\ndevilplaytoy: lol dont listen to them i havent said anything to them\r\ndevilplaytoy: i mean u can,\r\ndevilplaytoy: nothing should happen\r\ndevilplaytoy: i mean i have no reason to report fiora unless shes toxic\r\ndevilplaytoy: im not flaming anyone. i\r\ndevilplaytoy: i called darius %%%%%s\r\ndevilplaytoy: apprently that means annie and zyra too\r\ndevilplaytoy: aphroomoo uses it on stream im done LMAO\r\ndevilplaytoy: riot will ban pro players if they want too\r\ndevilplaytoy: how did that stun wtf\r\ndevilplaytoy: damn so clsoe\r\n\r\nBasically the the rest half the game was me arguing with them on this BS. They knew I was going to get muted for it because I told them earlier I already had been toxic before. Seriously?

How you spell it is irrelevant. How you feel about it is irrelevant. It's hate speech and the entire community overwhelmingly voted to ban it from the game.

The truth is neither are acceptable as they are both use for the same thing. It would be the same thing had you use this type of language at the store, at work, or school they don't care which you are using, as both are offensive!","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Siddward","date":"2016-11-03T10:29:38.791+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Hate speech?
