Their backs and arms are pretty muscled (above average, at least), and their hands can suffer a few cuts from sharp cardboard or even box cutters, plus the usual callus, giving them a rather rough-looking skin.\nSame goes for people who work in e.g. the production area of a car manufacturer: they'll be muscled all over (a fair bit more than most booksellers, of course), look rather rough.\nThus, nope. You can't reliably recognise a female from a male just by looking at their hands, you'll need far more than just that. I'm a victim of such prejudices, so I can tell you at least that ;D\n\nAlso, it's pretty easy to say that when you already know the person. Or maybe you're an ace and 99% of the people who were shown pictures of Sneaky are dumb, your call.\n\n__Edit__: and boy does he look good, especially as Sivir.","replies":[{"poster":"PowerSlave993","date":"2018-09-27T01:04:50.123+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When i first saw the image, i knew it was something wrong with the person.

When I was 20, a foreign 14-year-old took me for a 15-year-old male, and even most adult customers at the bookshop refer to me as \"the boy who works here from time to time\".\n\nAs a side note, it's pretty amusing to play ambiguously: people who think of me as a male are greeted with a sweet voice and fluid movements, others get to see my rougher side. Most of the time they won't know what to think any more.
