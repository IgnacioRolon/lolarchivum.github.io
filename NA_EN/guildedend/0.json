I checked in normals to see how i do, i had a couple of my friends look at how i played in replays and they said i was able to win game if i had decent players which brings me to the next section of MMR. I&#039;m silver 5 with a bronze 3 mmr (labeled elo hell by op.gg) and i keep getting worse and worse teammates to play with while my opponents are ALL silver 3 and higher. i can&#039;t carry in any role because i&#039;m getting 12 man bot lane and 15 man mid lane every time i play this stupid stupid game. How do i climb on my own by fucking them before they can fuck me?","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-01-21T02:16:52.989+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"what the hell is 15 man mid lane?","replies":[{"poster":"GuildedEnd","date":"2017-01-21T11:19:48.812+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's an exaggeration.
