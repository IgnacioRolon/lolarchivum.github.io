Why would I show love towards someone abusing me?\n\n1. Being in a loving state of mind is much more pleasant than angry. (IMO)\n\n2. I've never seen a toxic argument settled by throwing more toxicity into the mix. I have seen players \"un-tilt\" because of a compassionate response.\n\n3. Sometimes people are just venting. I've said the absolute worst things without actually meaning them. I already regret what I said. Pointless to dwell on it. \n\n4. Your behavior can spread to others.
