Now I am lvl 43 and I received one, so I guess the other one was just a bug that occurred when I finished a mission at the same time as I leveled up! Can you do anything about this? \r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nKIff.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-28T05:38:56.734+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Gotcha covered!
