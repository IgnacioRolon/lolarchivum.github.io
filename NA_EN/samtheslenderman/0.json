I tried logging in this morning, just to see my account is banned for the use of third-party software.\nWhen i saw your story, i immediately checked match history: 3 games i never played. With 2 champions i never play (vayne and fiora) in a game mode i never play (ranked). How can i fix this asap?","replies":[{"poster":"The Anivia OTP","date":"2019-09-01T18:54:19.984+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Send ticket to support","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lapis","date":"2019-08-31T05:27:51.373+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I believe that those weren't your games because you don't seem to play those champs, although you do have the most diverse champ pool I've seen recently.

After contacting Support about it, you should change your password so it doesn't happen again.\n\nI got hacked once before. I found out because my brother checked my Match History to see a game I just played that I did well in (the last game I played), and he said a couple were played after that. I was confused and he showed me a {{champion:33}} game and a {{champion:104}} game, which I didn't play. \n\nThe next day I tried to log on but my password was wrong, so I contacted Riot Support, and thankfully, after answering all their questions right, they recovered my account, and allowed me to change my password.\n\nWhen I logged on, there was only one person on my friends list, and they weren't there before. All of my (like, 50) friends were removed, and my brother was blocked because he warned the person that stole my account that he knew they weren't me.\n\nEverything is fine now, but they wasted both of my Champion Refunds (That was one of the questions Riot Support asked me. \"Have you used any refunds in the past year?\"), although they _did_ give me Star Guardian Lulu, which was nice. I started playing Lulu after that, and got a game where I went 40/3 support with no adc.","replies":[{"poster":"SamtheSlenderman","date":"2019-08-31T05:43:14.981+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, I'm currently trying to change the email but it's linked to a different email that was made without me knowing it was made.
