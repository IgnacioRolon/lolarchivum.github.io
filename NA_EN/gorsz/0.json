Why is he the #1 go-to  mid laner in the game?  Also dont pros still play Zed?  Why?\n\n\nZed is the go to mid laner (as an assassin) because one by one, Riot is ripping the throat out of assassins, and he is the last one left standing.\n\nThe difference with Zed is that most other champions can perform their job without their ultimate. Go ahead, try and assassinate someon as a non-fed Zed without your ultimate. i DARE you. Because it isnt possible. Meanwhile, Fizz, Ahri, LB (20 cooldown, hourglass doesnt count that or Ahri's ult), Talon, all capable of killing without their ult (talon has the hardest time of those listed, but he doesnt get hard countered by hourglasses active, its a soft counter, unlike Zed).\n\nThe reason Hourglass countering Zed is a bigger deal than other champions is for a couple reasons: 1) you dont need to be quick or good with the active to avoid 2/3 of his burst. 2) It can stop his ult, and his entire combo because of the cast time on his ult. \n\nNow, compare that to Fizz, Ahri, LB, or Talon (or even Akali). Sure you could Hourglass something of their combo. But Talon does his so fast you would need almost beyond human reaction time to use it against a competent Talon. Ahri does 2/3 of her burst while your charmed and incapable of using the active, as well as being able to save her second and third ult charge for when hourglass ends, meaning you only negate 1/3 of her ult. LBs ult is on a 20 second cooldown, so hourglass is useless against her in terms of avoiding damage.\n\n> Now check the cooldown of QSS. Now check the cooldown of Zed's ultimate. Now consider that it help 0 bit against Zed's poke - and that Zed can basically build a brutalizer for the cost.\n> \n> You don't beat him cause you survive him, but you fall behind since he is a whole midgame item ahead when it comes to lane harass. He will outtrade you.\n\n\n120/100/80 vs. 90 seconds.\n\nWhat is your point? At level 16, he has a 10 second window to use his ult on you if you have QSS/mercurial. That is so small it might as well not exist.\n\nAnd if as an ADC youre getting poked by Zed, something is seriously wrong with you.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Kowe The Ewok","date":"2014-12-01T18:54:29.996+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":6,"body":"If 5 people have to build Zhonyas to ensure not to get instagibbed something is horribly wrong.\n\nBut the Zed abuse fanboy base on these forums is strong.

No. They would play safe until they can do something.

I dont know exactly how long it takes for Zed to 100-0 an enemy, but it is long enough that a good CC champion can put him down. Do everything you have to to make Zed not fed or have enough gold if he is that big of an issue. If there is another fed champions on the enemy team and you can't focus Zed, then that isn't the champions, that is 80% of the time your team did poorly in the Laning Phase. If you cannot peel a Zed then don't blame the champion, look for ways to counter the champion rather than shout about how you can't do anything against him on the forums. Don't be lazy, get out of the habit of always play X way and you will win. Look to counter your enemy and win based on the current match, not a pre-game schematic in your head.","replies":[]}]}
