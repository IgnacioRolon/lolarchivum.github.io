Because it lets you enter  the next game sooner.\nHowever all games are winnable till you get to the highest of tiers where once the enemy has a big enough lead you're dead. They dont make mistakes. You lose. That is it.\n\nI'm talking people that make it to worlds type of ELO.","replies":[{"poster":"Awhegark","date":"2018-05-09T23:31:41.825+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, lol.

I essentially got my champion nerfed for being too good at the game. \n\nI was getting level 1 pentakills.  Only me.  Nobody else was but I never have again since the rework.\nIt made it so it doesn't matter how good you are at the game anymore. \nYou could be better than anybody alive and it doesn't matter... you are still going to loose when you 1vs5 with a dead team defending the nexus.\n\nRiot made it a game of competition and made it into a game of chance more like a slot machine depending on if you ever get a good teamate like yourself.  I don't.  I have 4 quitters every game with a sour attitude. \nThere isn't a champ you can win with when your team is bad since Riot destroyed Fiora.\n\nA game of skill and a game of chance or two different things. \n\nIt was a good game.\n\nTake away Fiora's double lunge and there is no way you can win based on skill. \nTake away Fiora's ult and there is no longer a way to defend 1vs5 with 4 dead teamates at the end of the match every game it's the same story. \n\n5 vs 1 Nerfed Fiora = gg\n\nSkill no longer has a chance to win based on skill.\n\nIt's based on luck. \n\nLuck that you might get a good player on your team and that just doesn't happen.","replies":[{"poster":"ReportForRefusin","date":"2018-05-11T07:06:50.181+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Level 1 Pentakills.
