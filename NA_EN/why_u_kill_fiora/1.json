The Fiora rework is great and that my main isn't ruined forever. \n\nNot too bright. \n\nThat's ok.  I am here to enlighten you. \n\nI am still upset with the rework because I play Fiora more than anyone alive.","replies":[{"poster":"Wínters Dawn","date":"2018-07-10T17:32:03.251+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bro, youve been making threads like this for what the past 2 years. \nYour obsession is actually a little disturbing. You really really really need to look into this.

You just ranmmble man. Half the shit you say sounds like a homless man who's drunk off his ass yelling about microchips in his skin. \n\nI looked up your op.gg. you have games that you are going 1-10, 0-9. 2-11. Like most of your games, even your games a fiora. If you are doing that consistently bad theres more to it than simply balance issues. \n\nYouve been doing this, these \"drunken\" rambles for like 2 years straight maybe even longer and countless times riot has told you to stop because you spam threads over and over.

Last years mods had to step in. In one of the threads he said that riot reworked fiora to intentionally take away HIS skill. He said that he was just so good at fiora that riot took that away from him personally. \nHe also said that in most of his games he would very often get lvl1 penta kills and riot reworked her to punish him(again as if they had some personal vendetta against him specifically) for being so good.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ankoanko19","date":"2018-07-10T11:38:27.965+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just let it go dude.","replies":[]}]}
