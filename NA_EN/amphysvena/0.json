When checking match history that match has no ranking, but the ARAM below it has.\r\nIs this a bug?  Weird to remove ranking from draft and not ARAM.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-23T03:17:21.851+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's preeeeetty weird actually. That match history data is being pulled from our servers, and I double-checked what that match grade should have been. In the process I found out why you aren't able to see your grade on the client, those matches haven't been uploaded to our servers yet. Without the data being on our servers you won't be able to see the grade for that match.","replies":[{"poster":"Amphysvena","date":"2017-06-25T02:51:09.453+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah, okay. Can see rank on that match now. Not 100% sure but think the match was around 00.00 (midnight) when draft is closed for Eune so maybe thought that was the issue.   But it´s just some kind of update lag?  Was so afraid that I couldn´t do my chest farming in draft. :P","replies":[]}]}]}
