So the issue with Pyke was mass cd chanined and easy to aquire as a 2 cost unit.\r\nWhat allowed the chaining to happen was Shojin. \r\nChange #1: Mana cost: 100 ⇒ 125\r\nShojin gives mana back based of % of max mana not really much a difference here 15% is 15%\r\nChange #2: Starting mana: 50 ⇒ 75\r\nShojin activates after first cast. By increasing starting mana along with the max mana he effectively still needs to gererate the exact same amount of mana to activate his ult and shojin.\r\n\r\nSo am i missing something or are these changes just thrown in here to make it look like the issue was addressed?","replies":[{"poster":"Ephensta","date":"2019-07-18T23:14:58.500+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes we need a Pyke nerf in this mode. His stun range is far too broad for one, then another is he does more damage than a Zed (another lvl 2(green) champ at his level. Same items, stars, everything.  You'd think Zed would win with his Bonus damage from ninja bonus.... That's what I had and my Zed had still lost 1v1 to a pyke lol.....  Someone at Rito HQ must be a pyke fanboy/girl.  {{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porglit","date":"2019-07-17T18:30:06.335+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If my math is right, it used to take him 4 autos after his ult procced before he ult again.

For a support he's stupid OP. His ult needs to be straight damage and not an AoE execute with a blink. I can't think of a champ that has an AoE execute built into a kit. His kit is insane. 2 Dashes/blinks, weaker Eve type camouflage, basically a weaker blitz hook, an AoE stun with one of his dashes/blinks. He has weaker Tahm Kench grey health. It means that he's an assassin, but really doesn't need items because he has an execute. High skill level to use, but so what?\n\nHe needs a complete rework.","replies":[]}]}
