If a skin is 975 RP+, the team updating the champion would need to update our work when they update gameplay for a particular champion.

Like, Kat got a Project skin in 08/2016 before the assassin update in 11/2016. Then Maokai got the Vic skin in 11/2016 before the tank update that was underway in 02/2017.\n\nDo you guys sometimes work on skins, then other teams are like \"oh, here's a surprise rework!\"? Seems like that might be kind of frustrating for your team to do a skin and then re-do some abilities 2-3 months after it ships.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Imperial Japan","date":"2017-10-16T03:48:10.906+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot KateyKhaos,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=YpHpFO1y,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2017-10-12T18:34:40.400+0000)\n>\n> Hey Lupan! \n> \n> Do you have any suggestions for Death Sworn Zed or Death Sworn Katarina?

Sorry - also my thing about it is that the Zed and Kat doesn't have a specific thing going on for them other than being \"spooky\". They don't fit in the Halloween/Harrowing spirit I feel because they don't have any cool back story or legend behind them that skins like Headless Hecarim does, or the silly and fun nature that Kitty Kat Katarina or Mundo Mundo has. With some skins such as the new Deathsworn Viktor, I believe that they could pass on as a fitting harrowing skin with just the \"spooky\" aspect  due to it relating to something (a shaman/voodoo wizard) . (As well as other skins such as Zombie Brand.) \n\nBasically, I don't see how they would fit the halloween spirit. All I can see from them are just skins you made so that you could make deathsworn Viktor. They don't derive from any myth or legend, any Halloween costumes, or really anywhere at all. I think that they would be pretty decent skins if they weren't included in the annual harrowing skin set.\n\nEdit: I'm pretty excited to see what the story is like!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Linna Excel","date":"2017-10-12T19:10:48.446+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Katey, I think my biggest problem with Katarina skins in general has to do with the fact she's dual-wielding swords in all her models (even the base) but her gameplay doesn't support that fantasy.  I really, really wish it did, but it doesn't.  So she looks like one thing, but her gameplay is that of a dagger tosser.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PrincessKatarina","date":"2017-10-12T19:06:39.344+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi, im the kat friend of Vanquisher79 xd, i really like the whole skin and also LOVE the sound when she uses her dagger and w, i just wanna agree on that if her pants would be a bit darker it would be really nice, also if you cant change the pants colors u can do so the boots/shoes could be dark, it adds a good contrast to the skin and i think it would be really nice :) \nLove the skin tho and hope it comes out soon, cant wait to buy it x3 {{champion:55}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Nintendo 3DS","date":"2017-10-13T18:25:42.473+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you still hearing ideas for these skins ? :D\nI refuse to let them going so hated, even if i did dislike them myself. I'll try to submit ideas for upgrades ?\nWrote a whole of text in another thread so i'll try to rewrite it fast !\nBasically. More ghostlike Kata. Probably paler, with an uneasy vibe almost.\nI found Kata very pretty, but its a shame you wouldn't make her as ghostlike as Viktor&Zed. Its a bit of a missed opportunity if you ask me.\nI tried to make a redesign of her based on Ghostbride Morgana, maybe that could help ?\n\nFor Zed, well... The unexpected weapons...no matter what, armblades and shurikens would really have been the safe choice...because now it looks really off with his abilities in game. Especially the Q throwing...\nPerhaps give him more armor. His midriff showing makes him look poor, its a bit out of place. Make him feels more impressive and threatening. Something really scary. \nAlso perhaps buff his legs a bit, they look really skinny compared to the rest of his body. I think that plain black boots could have worked better than these slipper-shoes thingy.\n\nBoth of these guys abilities could use more screams and ghost effects. Someone suggested that when Zed kills a unit, their spirits goes to him. Would mirror well his \"shadow stealing\" ult passive (in fact, it be so cool if even regular Zed could do it with the ennemies shadows)\n\nAlso could maybe tone down their bright blue? They looks like they are made of pool water, not really ectoplasm... I think the colors really need to be darkened, on both their skin and their armor.\n\nMaybe tone down too the overabbundance of ghosts popping in Zed abilities.\n\nHope it helps !","replies":[]}]}
