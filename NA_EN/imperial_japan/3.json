So I wanted your opinion. What champion would you like being included in these ferocious skin lines?\r\n\r\n- Dragon trainers - Lulu, Tristana\r\n- Dragon Slayers - Pantheon, Jarvan, Braum, Vayne\r\n- Shyvanna -\r\n\r\nSo, many people have requested Dragon trainer Swain as many people see him fitting and personally I would like the inclusion of Dragon Slayer Yasuo! (I have 2 or 3 threads I made on it) Yes I do know the band Wagon hate going on around Yasuo justified recently by his new broken build (which has/is being solved/nerfed) but this isn&#039;t a thread about that.
