The server knows you're dead the instant you're dead-- you can't cast while dead. The signal to do the ability sent from your client just won't go through because it reaches the server and you're already dead.\n\nThe only way it can go off while you're dead is if there IS a delay, and there totally is.

Tryndamere is a risky champion (squishy, melee) whose most satisfying element is outplaying with his ultimate. The delay does nothing but ruin his feel. You think the ult. was timed to escape with just 20 hp.... NOPE, here's a random delay to annoy you.\n\nI barely play Tryndamere but this delay has frustrated me to no amount. I have great ping and kept trying to time everything well only to be punished for trying to play the champion to its maximum potential.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BongTheRippa","date":"2015-05-14T19:43:51.500+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"This just changed everything for me...died countless times where I was sure that I ulted before the  kill.

I think any delay devised by the wiki user (not necessarily 100% accurate) is due to user-experienced delay due to imperfect latency. The skill is, to me, for what amount I've played Trynd, effectively instant.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hamacarina","date":"2019-06-11T23:39:11.303+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"riot please respond this is still a topic... when I click on ult in time and suddenly I see that I'm dead, I look at the ult and I see that it has 3 seconds cooldown on R,is this a bug or what ?","replies":[]},{"poster":"MLDzXnRRR","date":"2015-05-16T10:31:18.160+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've seen how Trynda ults (with no effect), dies, then his GA triggers and  he has no ult.","replies":[{"poster":"KvotheAdem","date":"2016-07-29T04:59:39.896+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This has happened to me.
