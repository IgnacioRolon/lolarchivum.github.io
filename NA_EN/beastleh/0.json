Something went wrong in the files or something after that last patch. When I went to connect it would say it failed to connect no matter what. If you ask me, this is a Riot Mistake. I reinstalled and repaired and I fixed it but now I&#039;m punished for an AFK that was Riots fault. Why? Shouldn&#039;t we get a few AFKs free, in case like, you have to leave? What if Someone in my family needed me right away? Not only is Grandma hurt, but I get punished too? AFTER 1 AFK? My grandmother is not hurt, that was hypothetical, but still you get it. It&#039;s a fucking poor shit system and I hope riot gives half a shit about it one day. One fucking AFK over something I have no control over. You can even look up my last game. Volibear. Never connected. Never had a fucking chance. I don&#039;t deserve this.","replies":[{"poster":"Feuer","date":"2016-03-21T22:52:21.253+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You do actually get a warning and then they can ban you and besides it does more good than it does harm so its fine.","replies":[{"poster":"Beastleh","date":"2016-03-21T23:03:25.017+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"I never got a single warning. This is my first AFK in literal fucking MONTHS. LAst time was about 6 month ago I had to go to work for an emergency. I got punished for that too. Where is my warning? and how is a 20 minute que time good at all? Even if someone was an actual frequent AFKer what does this do? They still get in games and can still AFK.\n\n???????????????","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Tantram","date":"2016-03-21T23:56:09.757+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"The warning is the message you typed 'I Agree' to.

But I don't remember that. That probably was years ago. Before I ever took this game seriously. I never AFK. I try so hard to avoid leaving games.
