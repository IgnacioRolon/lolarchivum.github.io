I've already, on numerous occasions, mistaken Maokai for Yorick.\n\nEver since Maokai's visual update, from a distance, his color scheme and overall profile looks like Yorick. I think it has something to do with mao looking like he's hunching over now...\n\nIs this something ya'll are aware of?

Both mia, and a 'Volibear' comes running out of a brush at you. Is he going to stun you, or toss you backwards? The half second you have to figure that out might make the difference between you getting back to your tower or dying. (If Voli, you might want to run to the side, so he'll toss you sideways, other than straight back into enemy team, if Udyr, you might want to run straight back so you'll be stunned closer to your tower)\nToo much gameplay confusion.","replies":[]}]}
