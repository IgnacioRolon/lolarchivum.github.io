Learn how to last hit. Aim for 100 cs by ~11 minutes. There's going to be a lot of randomness in it all, but getting out of lane with farm is important.\n\n2. Learn how to keep your farm up. You can't typically get 10 cs per minute for the entire game, but try to never be more than 100 behind. Always have at least 300 cs in a 40 minute game, etc. If you find yourself falling far behind this mark, you need to get back to lanes better instead of grouping for no gain.\n\n3. Don't die. Honestly, it's Bronze. There's a lot of randomness and a lot of crazy silly engages. Don't be the guy who gets picked off. Grouping can be hard, getting objectives can be hard. But at the end of the day, if you're the 6 item AD Carry and you're not the first one to die, you're probably going to win teamfights.","replies":[{"poster":"Envy Sin","date":"2015-03-11T10:17:36.383+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"^ That, Farming though is probably the thing that would take you to silver.
