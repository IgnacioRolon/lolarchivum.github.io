Never sulk in the misfortune you're in, make the most out of what you have. \nIf vayne doesn't have a keystone, then she doesn't have a keystone. If she offers nothing, so be it. Do what you can and avoid doing what you can't.\n\nPassive aggression leading to straight up insults pretty much validates the toxicity. This has clearly stepped over the line. With riot's standard this might've warranted 25 game chat restriction instead, but 2 week ban isn't unreasonable. I can't give you my opinion, because my standard (while I disagree) is considered too high objectively.\n\nIrrelevant side note, you're playing a team game, where acting cooperatively is highly valued, yet you seem to value satisfaction through voicing your opinion over an encouraging atmosphere to bring out the team's maximum potential, and even asking to 1v1 in a game where you're not supposed to 1v1 in.  I know you like this game, but I feel like it doesn't suit you.","replies":[{"poster":"Hentai me down","date":"2017-09-29T16:54:29.277+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"she was in the enemy team.Everyone was toxic. xd","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-09-29T02:24:17.402+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Needlessly rude and immature, but i would expect a 14-game chat restriction for a first offense, not a 14 day ban.\n\nAs a tip, \"1v1 me\" is the classic way of saying \"i am a 15 year old brat and i am MAAAAAAD SRS BSNS\".
