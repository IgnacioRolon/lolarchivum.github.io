I try to keep playing around it, but then it starts freezing, over and over, off and on. AT some point I was able to move around but couldn't target anything, my teammates were beside me at one second then all the way over in the enemy's base the next. I then tried to close the client to restart it, league tried to update when I reloaded, then i was back online and the game was done. My internet connection is perfectly fine and I've never experienced anything like this before. My computer runs very well and I rarely ever experience difficulties while playing league. What just happened? And I'm 100% sure my teammates are going to report me, especially since 2/4 of them were being toxic all game without reason. I don't really think this is fair :/","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-07T00:03:00.192+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you were experiencing the common symptoms of [*Packet Loss*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packet_loss), which occurs when the data packets that store you and other player's movements/actions are jumbled up and lost along the way.
