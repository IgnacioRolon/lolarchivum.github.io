It doesn't even load \"connecting to server\" it just goes instantly to \"server issue 1,2,3\". I use chrome and i'm not sure if that the problem. I've re-downloaded it 9 times and I've cleaned my laptop. I've used internet explorer 9 and it still hasn't been fixed. I have checked the fire wall but that not the issue.  If anyone can help i would appreciate it.","replies":[{"poster":"Digital Ram","date":"2014-12-04T00:21:18.594+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Sharinganka,\n\nThat issue sounds like an issue that a few players were experiencing.
