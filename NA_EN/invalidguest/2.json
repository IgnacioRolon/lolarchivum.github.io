You chose to be a bigger person by playing support and jungler, even in your placement games.

None of my silver/gold friends rushed it, and it paid off) have that level of immaturity, but you didn't.\n\nYou know what that means?\n\nBronze players focus too much on mechanics and roles and blah blah blah, but you've been willing to take the heavy teamwork roles.
