There is no chance of missing it, and he gets tanky stats on his ultimate to make him able to essentially 1v2 anyone. moreover, when I used to play veigar and actually deleted people more often than not both sides broke out into uncontrollable laughter over it.

In worlds 2014, he was the most picked/banned champion next to alistar (who had that bug where he could autoattack on headbutt which was why he was 100% pick/ban)\n3. he counters the entire tank jungler role. At high levels of play, amumu, fiddlesticks and naut are all considered unviable because lee sin exists.\n4. he's a generalist champion who can do everything, and while he can't do everything better than everyone, he's a safepick due to his intense mobility. That being said, his mobility was never really complained about until season 4 when the trinket wards showed up and Lee sin suddenly got a free dash. Yes he is just as mobile now as he was before season 4, but Lee actually had to pay for it back then. 75 gold or 800 gold for the sightstone if Lee wanted to get that mobility.","replies":[{"poster":"SpongebobIsLife","date":"2015-02-25T05:07:42.159+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":26,"body":"Well I see many problems with your statements.

Their mid and late game is better, and their early game is also comparatively close to lee's with the exception of fiddles. Yes he is seen a lot in the LCS, but does that really mean he needs a nerf? Lee Sin has nothing to do with why those junglers are played at high levels. It has everything to do with the fact that bruiser and mobile junglers are the meta this season, bc every other lane, favors mobility. Yes I understand it's frustrating that lee has so much mobility in his Q and W, but if he didn't, why even bother picking lee? Theres a reason Riot wont nerf lee. It's not because he is their poster boy or anything, but it's because he is the fall back jungler for everyone. Every lane has one of these, a fall back champion. Lee is strong, but nowhere near op.","replies":[{"poster":"Pryotra","date":"2015-02-25T05:18:53.372+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":0,"body":">He has been gutted so many times in the past that right now I feel like his kit is as balanced it will ever be.\n\nCALL AN AMBERLAMPSE, I'm LAUGHING SO HARD IM HAVING A STROKEFDDDDDikow;afdls;afjiewkoa;","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"RanmanReborn","date":"2015-02-25T03:40:01.582+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"Don't forget his percent damage execute, spell vamp shield and his slow which means you'll never actually get away from him.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kobila2000","date":"2015-02-25T02:13:32.289+0000","up_votes":27,"down_votes":0,"body":"People are finally sick to death of seeing the same broken design over and over again in every other game they've played almost since he was released.

Yes, he's annoyingly mobile, has a crazy kit, and can fill just about every roll, but he's fun and exciting to play. He's not some boring right click faceroll champ, he's a thrilling, enojoyable champion to play.","replies":[{"poster":"TheRainInSpain","date":"2015-02-25T07:05:25.565+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can have fun champions, but a champion does not need an overloaded, overpowered kit to be fun.  Lee Sin's kit is pretty overloaded, and fairly overpowered, for a generalist.  I expect that level of power to be found on specialist champions, you know, those that have a niche and are rather sucky outside the niche?  At the very least, I expect Lee Sin to have his spell vamp removed, be unable to hop to un-upgraded trinket wards (so he has to either buy a ward, upgrade the trinket, or buy a sightstone), and receive a hard nerf to the percentage damage of his ultimate.  It's not very fun getting one shot by Lee Sin WITHOUT taking a critical hit or Lee Sin building full damage.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Hawkefire","date":"2015-02-25T03:51:36.950+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=InvalidGuest,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=F7ENN1Ba,comment-id=,timestamp=2015-02-25T01:06:34.367+0000)\n>\n> one veigar nerf later\n> \n> community responds with massive backlash on boards and reddit\n> \n> \"sorry guys, but these changes are LOCKED.
