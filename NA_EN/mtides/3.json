I live in northern Ohio, and get around 65-70ms, which is an obvious problem. My initial thought was that I had something on my computer that was affecting my connection. However, after asking around and some calls to my ISP, I was made aware that it was issue that was native to my local area. I asked my ISP what the fix would be for this issue, and they informed me that there is little they can do considering that my connection to the hop prior to riot game servers was around 15ms. I ran a trace route in hopes to find the issue:\r\n\r\nTracing route to 104.160.131.1 over a maximum of 30 hops\r\n\r\n  1     1 ms    &lt;1 ms    &lt;1 ms  192.168.0.1\r\n  2    16 ms    19 ms     8 ms  10.24.0.1\r\n  3    16 ms    17 ms    10 ms  72.240.7.61\r\n  4    18 ms    18 ms     9 ms  72.240.111.29\r\n  5    10 ms    12 ms     6 ms  72.240.111.49\r\n  6    22 ms    24 ms    16 ms  xe-10-3-2.bar2.Detroit1.Level3.net [4.53.74.101]\r\n  7    20 ms    15 ms    13 ms  ae-2-3603.ear3.Chicago2.Level3.net [4.69.159.186]\r\n  8    52 ms    59 ms    55 ms  104.160.131.1\r\n\r\nTrace complete.\r\n\r\nAs you can see the hop that is posing the issue is between 7-8. This has been a problem for around ~6 months, and is quite annoying. I have made calls to my ISP and Level3 (The people routing my connection) and they all have said this would be an issue that Riot Games would need to resolve. This is an issue with everyone is our area, so I would hope that this issue would be of utmost importance. \r\nThanks in advance. (I hope)\r\n\r\n_**Additional Information**_: My ISP is Buckeye Cable System, and the people who route the connection are Level3 Communications.\r\n\r\n_**PS:**_ For full disclosure, I ran another Trace Route to the alternate Riot IP:\r\n\r\nTracing route to 104.160.131.3 over a maximum of 30 hops\r\n\r\n  1     1 ms    &lt;1 ms    &lt;1 ms  192.168.0.1\r\n  2    12 ms    12 ms     7 ms  10.24.0.1\r\n  3    21 ms    17 ms    13 ms  72.240.7.61\r\n  4    24 ms    19 ms    13 ms  72.240.111.29\r\n  5    12 ms    11 ms    12 ms  72.240.111.49\r\n  6    48 ms     *       24 ms  xe-10-3-2.bar2.Detroit1.Level3.net [4.53.74.101]\r\n  7    17 ms    17 ms    18 ms  ae-2-3603.ear3.Chicago2.Level3.net [4.69.159.186]\r\n  8    49 ms    56 ms    49 ms  4.15.84.86\r\n  9    50 ms    53 ms    47 ms  104.160.131.3\r\n\r\nTrace complete.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-30T04:26:14.438+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your traceroutes here show a little bit of info, but there's a lot of context missing here.
