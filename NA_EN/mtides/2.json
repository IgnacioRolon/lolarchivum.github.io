The issue I'm experiencing seems to extreme increase in ping (ms) in our local area. I asked around in (northwest ohio) and everyone I've spoken with has said the same thing. All of their pings have gone up from ~20 to 60-90. I've called our local ISP (Buckeye Cable System) to no avail.\n\nEdit: I have done some more research and found this in my trace route to the riot servers:\n\ntraceroute to 104.160.131.1 (104.160.131.1), 30 hops max, 38 byte packets\n **1**  10.24.0.1 (10.24.0.1)  20.000 ms  10.000 ms  20.000 ms\n **2**  72.240.7.61 (72.240.7.61)  20.000 ms  20.000 ms  20.000 ms\n **3**  72.240.111.29 (72.240.111.29)  20.000 ms  72.240.111.33 (72.240.111.33)  20.000 ms  72.240.111.29 (72.240.111.29)  10.000 ms\n **4**  72.240.111.49 (72.240.111.49)  20.000 ms  30.000 ms  20.000 ms\n **5**  te-4-3.car2.Detroit1.Level3.net (4.53.74.101)  110.000 ms  110.000 ms  110.000 ms\n\nIt would seem that the drastic increase in ping occurs in line 5, the \"te-4-3.car2.Detroit1.Level3.net\" \nI have no clue about networking, so I ended up calling my IPS (Buckeye Cable System) again for the 4th time today. Unfortunately, they seem to know even less than me... I ended up emailing riots peering team in hopes that they could work with my ISP to find a solution. (not likely). If anyone has any ideas on how to help, don't hesitate to send me a private message or leave a comment.

Just as in your previous trace, this one shows the same hike in latency at the following node:\n\n> **te-4-3.car2.Detroit1.Level3.net**\n\nSince your ISP partners with Level 3 (the owner of this node), I'd recommend reaching back out to your ISP and specifically request a tier 2 agent or a supervisor before providing this traceroute to them. This should provide additional context they need to launch a proper investigation for this issue.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions.","replies":[{"poster":"MTides","date":"2016-12-07T03:31:06.509+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello, I've attempted to reach out the my local ISP (Buckeye Cable) about the Level 3 Node dropping packets multiple times.
