Since a couple of months ago, I have been experiencing a very consistently high ping. After the server move, I was able to maintain ~23ms. Unfortunately, for what ever reason, it was jumped to being 60-100ms consistently. I ran a trace-route to determine the problem node, and have found out that my connection is being routed to Riot Games LA location. This was a concern to me because I live in northern Ohio, about 3hrs away from Chicago which I where I thought the servers were moved to. I am unsure if this is a problem with my ISP (Buckeye Cable System) or on your guys end. I don't believe that it is a problem on my side, because everyone I have conversed with locally has told me the same thing.  I will go ahead and paste in my trace-route below.

I can get a better image of your routing through [WinMTR](http://winmtr.net/winmtr-v0-92-now-available/).  Download that and run a traceroute directly to the NA game server:  104.160.131.1.  This can certanly help determine any routing issues, but also keep in mind that there may be more local problems as well.  I would recommend using the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide before expanding from there.
