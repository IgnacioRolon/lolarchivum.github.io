For the record, I'm struggling in silver now\n\nWhat happened for me is that everything \"clicked.\" That is very cliche, and doesnt help much, but it is the easiest thing to describe what truly happened.\n  Other thoughts\n **  1.  **csing went from 70-80 at 15 min to about 120\n**   2.** laning mechanics improved.  The point is for you to have more kills and minions than your opponent out of laning phase.  With that said,      push hard when your opp. is out of lane, so that most of yours are taken by their turret.\n**  3. ** Ward shit.  Bronze players aren't completely stupid, they dont intentionally walk into fatal situations, but they will when they don't know that a fatal situation exists (such as a collapse by 3 fed enemies) Even if you are the only one on your team with all three wards placed, chances are your team has more wards on the map than their team does.\n**4.** Midgame is when my playing falls off the most.  #1, recognize what you suck at in game and improve it.  #2. MAXIMIZE WHAT YOU DO MIDGAME.  The reason I say this is because I could have 120 cs at 15 minutes and then 5 minutes later, have 127 cs.  I did nothing but roam and look for low percentage kills those 5 minutes, and gained about 300 gold during that time.  I could have gotten 40 more cs, and snowballed for my team, without the low percentage kills I thought I needed.\n**5.** Late game is when bronze players struggle, mainly because of poor prioritizing and decision making.  People need leaders, and no where is this more true than in League.  Be aggressive, type in chat (without flaming).  If YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO, say it.  Get their attention.\n\nIf you do these things without fail, you are guaranteed to escape bronze.  Add me (FyreNinja) if you want to duo, I'm currently Silver rn.\n\nGood Luck and Have Fun!\n\n(PS) NEVER, EVER, EVER flame.  If you are, it is probably because that person did something wrong, and that same person will not be willing to take shit from a fellow bronze player.  In his head, he thinks he should be diamond, and doesnt want to be told differently.  Stay positive, never surrender until 2 inhibs are down (why purposely lose a ranked game) and stop playing when you begin to go on tilt.\n\nGLHF!","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Mormonator","date":"2014-11-03T01:39:50.650+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"No amount of games simply played can make you better if you aren't learning anything from them :) Try finding out what your weakness are, say asking someone of a higher elo to watch you or play with you, and try to fix them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Venompaw","date":"2014-11-03T03:28:17.261+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"feeding isn't really a problem cause it's a per match basis thing, I can go 0-7, just as easily as I can go 7-0.

As in, don't have vision for the sake of having vision, it alone is not useful at all.\n\n4- Typically my games in mid game involve 3 people walking back n forth in mid trying to get a tower / force an engage, 1 person split pushing, 1 person in jungle.\n\nCS is NOT important, If you're mid don't expect cs, you're being useful instead.\n\n5- get ANY objective, but if you have to choose, pick baron always.","replies":[{"poster":"Killer X 12","date":"2014-11-04T02:54:42.316+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd say that is extremely untrue.

You level in bot games till 30, lose your provo games (Win 3 or less and ur prolly gonna be in bronze for a new account)\n\n Then you just play till you get 100 ip. Dodge a few games. Do it again. The reason ppl smurf is because they want to play against shittier ppl than they usually would. Why else would you put effort into a second account when you have time and perhaps money into a main one? If you go through these forums, or even on twitch you can find someone showing how to go from bronze to diamond. Someone is doing it literally every day, even LCS players have admitted to internal competitions about getting accounts from bronze to challenger. You just intentionally lose placement games, fucking other people over. \n\n\nAlso, i wouldn't say most low elo players are smurfs. Top 20 percent is gold V is above. That means that 80 percent of the player base is silver and bronze. I dont' think a majority of that are smurfs, i just think that there are a fair amount of people who do smurf at low elo for easy face rolly wins.\n\nAgain, I dont' smurf, i'm not bronze, but this is what i see.
