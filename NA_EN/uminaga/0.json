But I formed a club early when it came out. Then clubs went offline and came back after the championship week. But now as the leader of the club I'm actually not in it nor does it show the tag I previously made. But my friends in the club are currently in it and say I'm in but I don't have a tag associated when I play a game or when hovered and I cannot be invited. Any others experiencing the same problem?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-11T04:28:34.379+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is a current issue with clubs that popped up after the re-enable.

Have someone invite you to a different club (do not leave yours) and put that club's tag on, then the option to put yours on should be there. It seems that the bug tells the game that you already have the tag on. Not sure why it only affects the owner, but i think that's what the bug is.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ngotchu","date":"2017-06-12T04:16:55.972+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"this is same for me.
