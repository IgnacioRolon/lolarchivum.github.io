For example his little followers (meeps?) sit on the tree branches in his splash art and that instantly made me think of kodamas from princess mononoke. I'm really interested if he was influenced by that, or if he was't then what inspired him. May I summon a rioter?","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2015-03-01T22:34:22.576+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't know, but I do know there are a lot of Rioters who adore the work of Studio Ghibli.

Princess Mononoke? Some of the most engaging characters.
