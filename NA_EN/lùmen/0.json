If one was already dead, though, the surviving member would probably be a lot less likely to pass the test, especially Rakan. Rakan's only purpose in life is to be with Xayah, if she died, he'd be useless. Xayah has a goal of reclaiming the world or something, so she would still have something to fight for.","replies":[{"poster":"GreenLore","date":"2017-04-05T12:11:39.976+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well she does say that she would burn down the world,built a castle and then hide the rest of her life inside that castle if Rakan died.\n\nSure she is likely exaggerating a bit,but it does look like she wouldn't be able to move forward without him either.","replies":[{"poster":"TzQGRUST39","date":"2017-04-05T15:10:50.672+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Burning the world down seems like a pretty difficult and lengthy task ;)\n\nIf Rakan died she would definitely be devastated, but I think she would continue her goal (eventually) with 10 times the amount of edginess.\n\n\"She fights for the cause.
