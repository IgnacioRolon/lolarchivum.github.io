It has gotten worse, now a match will freeze withing 1-5 seconds of loading up.  Problem only has so far occurred when playing with a friend on same wifi, his computer does not freeze.  Tried in safe mode, no freeze issues, but around 1.5 seconds constant lag time.\r\n\r\nSince the windows 10 anniversary update just happened, it might be something to do with that, as apparently that has caused a lot of freezing, but I don't know why it only happens when I'm playing league of legends on wifi with someone else in the same game; when any of those conditions aren't true, it doesn't freeze.\r\n\r\nAny ideas?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-16T22:48:27.494+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The Windows 10 Anniversary update made some changes to the Xbox app that enabled the Game DVR feature by default.
