I dont even remember last time this acct had any punishment. Also what about the other people in my games calling me every name in the book??? In all honesty this is stupid and doesnt deserve anything more than a chat restriction. RIOT should rethink some of these punishment as I actually played with a RIOTER yesterday that inted and flamed on an actual riot acct... Did anything happen to him/her? doubtful...\r\n\r\nThanks for screwing over a player that has been with you since the start for something so little.\r\n\r\n\r\nGame 1\r\nxDJ Sona: i figured vayne was autistic based on his stats didnt know it was this bad though\r\nxDJ Sona: wow just wow\r\nxDJ Sona: lol you could have used heal to save me\r\nxDJ Sona: k you solo\r\nxDJ Sona: i didnt flame he flamed so i left\r\nxDJ Sona: yeah i muted you pings yorick\r\nxDJ Sona: what is reportable is adc calling me trash and garbage\r\nxDJ Sona: me being in top lane is not reportable\r\nxDJ Sona: i could really care less\r\nxDJ Sona: i mean im not trolling\r\nxDJ Sona: not playiung great but no not trolling\r\nxDJ Sona: the fact that people are actively just leaving me to die is not helping matters\r\nxDJ Sona: honestly i dont like vayne so ill prob afk\r\nxDJ Sona: yeah im done i would ff if i were you guys\r\nxDJ Sona: this is what happens when adc flames support when adc just let me die\r\nxDJ Sona: yeah if all report then im out\r\nxDJ Sona: have a good life\r\nxDJ Sona: gl next time\r\nxDJ Sona: well lvl 2 vayne just let me die without even using heal\r\nxDJ Sona: i did not flame a single time\r\nxDJ Sona: thats not what i said\r\nxDJ Sona: yorick just lying now\r\nxDJ Sona: that was it\r\nxDJ Sona: and i guess i was correct\r\nxDJ Sona: well i actually am pretty good normally\r\nxDJ Sona: 60% win over 400 sona games this season\r\nxDJ Sona: its not for no reason\r\nxDJ Sona: sb\r\nxDJ Sona: save your supps\r\nGame 2\r\nxDJ Sona: i feel like 3 of you are idiots\r\nxDJ Sona: gnar i gave you redemption and you run like little bitch\r\nxDJ Sona: infernal go get it\r\nxDJ Sona: wow\r\nxDJ Sona: noob ass team\r\nxDJ Sona: fuckinig shit ass team\r\nxDJ Sona: yoiu were dead\r\nxDJ Sona: this adc fkini bad\r\nxDJ Sona: this sona greedy?!?!?!?!? or this sona just way freaking better than you\r\nxDJ Sona: panth man\r\nxDJ Sona: help me\r\nxDJ Sona: xayah stfu\r\nxDJ Sona: if im dying help me\r\nxDJ Sona: its what you do\r\nxDJ Sona: trash adc","replies":[{"poster":"Awhegark","date":"2017-06-23T22:49:36.880+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Next bad word you say you are getting perma banned, remenber that.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-06-23T22:41:43.072+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ban escalated quickly.

The rest of the game is just you verbally abusing and harassing your teammates via insults and name-calling as well as threatening to afk just because you don't like Vayne, the same person that you called autistic at the very start of the match. Regardless of how other people are behaving this doesn't give you a free pass to behave poorly as well.\n\nAs for why it's a 14-day ban, most likely you have already received at least 35-games worth of chat restrictions and continued to behave poorly despite them. A 14-day ban is the next step on the punishment ladder after a 25-game chat restriction and the previous step before a permanent ban. Because you're at a 14-day ban continued poor behavior will result in a permanent ban regardless of severity. Next time just mute, report and move on instead of responding with negativity of your own.","replies":[]}]}
