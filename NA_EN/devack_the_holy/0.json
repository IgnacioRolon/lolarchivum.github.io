However, the new Death Timers are absolutely pointless on this map. Just had a game where we got ACED mid game, and the resulting 45-second-plus death timer allowed the enemy team to take in order:\r\n\r\n1 Base turret\r\n1 inhibitor\r\nalmost took the Nexus turret\r\n\r\nWith no chance for us to defend. \r\n\r\nUsually that&#039;s fine in SR, with the increased distance between the nexus and inhibitors allowing for greater time to travel and the chance to save the nexus turrets. But on TT, with the much smaller space between Nexus and inhibs, it&#039;s much more important to stave off an ACE, or the enemy could end much quicker with no repercussions. \r\n\r\nTBH, that&#039;s why I liked the old TT. An ACE wasn&#039;t as game-ending as it is now. This allows for much more intense battles of back-and-forth.\r\n\r\nNot to mention the other problems that plague the mode:\r\n\r\nIncredibly high number of bots: When the first question you ask the players who pick free week champs is &quot;Are you human?&quot;, that&#039;s a bad sign. (Dominion faces this problem as well.)\r\nLack of Normal Draft mode.\r\nLack of Solo Ranked mode.\r\n\r\ntl;dr: Revert the Death Timer changes.","replies":[{"poster":"MANWOLFAXEBOSS","date":"2015-06-11T00:33:56.468+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":3,"body":"Thanks for the feedback guys.\n\nDeath timers are super fickle. Very difficult to tune without thousands of games worth of data. That being said, they are actually shorter early game (6 seconds shorter at level 1), 0.5 seconds higher at level 6, the same at level 11, and slightly higher late game (4 seconds higher at level 18). The interval in which the game adds additional time to death timers was also changed to 30 seconds rather than one minute, but still scales at the same percentage (nothing really change, just smoother). So all in all, I think the outcome of that ace would have been the same pre-5.11.\n\nHowever, I will definitely be monitoring that stuff as it is really touchy.\n\nIn regards to the first tier turret, it is intentionally weak. It has all around lower stats, including attack range and vision. This was done for a number of reasons:\n1. Encourage more objective-focused gameplay\n2. Smooth out early game goals\n3. Encourage/Empower ADCs on a map that they traditionally haven't been terribly valued on (at least outside of competitive levels)\n\nWe are very conscious of the concern that games may go too long, but we hope that Vilemaw will help teams close out. Much like death timers, game length is also very difficult to fully understand without tons of data. Same sentiment here though, we're keeping close watch and will adjust as needed.","replies":[{"poster":"Solidair3","date":"2015-06-11T01:22:23.801+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"hey MWAB, just a little reminder, we were promised a new big discussion about dominion about 6 months ago that you said you'd get back to once the dust of the new season and SRU settled...
