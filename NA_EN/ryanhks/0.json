When everyone FINALLY accepts the game, It gets dodged. I was in 7 or 8 rooms before I finally got a game. People dodge because they don&#039;t want to play a zed, or their champ got banned. Or they were auto filled. Its getting old. I suggest harsher punishments all around. I think If you don&#039;t accept a game you should have a 5 min que timer every time. and if you dodge when a game gets accepted. 10 min que timer for the first 20 min for the second 30 min for 3+. I started looking for a game at 8:15 this morning. played ONE 32 min game, and now its 9:45. IMO I blame most of the dodges on autofill. I don&#039;t mind playing support so I don&#039;t dodge them but that seems to be the most likely culprit. Anyways rant over, I just want to get my voice out there that me, and everyone I play with are sick of the dodges, and just want to get into a game.","replies":[{"poster":"Magical Player","date":"2017-03-03T18:50:46.911+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"yes and no\nNo\nPeople want to dodge because they feel the game isn't a good game to play from lobby\ndon't disrespect that\nYes\ntroll dodging should be a larger loss in lp/bigger timers\nBut how to tell troll dodging to real dodging","replies":[{"poster":"Ryanhks","date":"2017-03-03T20:26:07.302+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Magical Player,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=aIlveFYY,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-03-03T18:50:46.911+0000)\n>\n> yes and no\n> No\n> People want to dodge because they feel the game isn&#x27;t a good game to play from lobby\n> don&#x27;t disrespect that\n> Yes\n> troll dodging should be a larger loss in lp/bigger timers\n> But how to tell troll dodging to real dodging\n\nI think getting rid of auto fill would cut dodged games in half. I don't prefer support but I'll play it. But sometimes i think im the only one lol. I would love to be able to que fill minus adc.

That's what the ban stage is for. I can't lane against ziggs very well. But I still go in. I'm not gonna dodge that and waste everyone's time. And every game I get better against him. I know I'll have rough time so I play passive and safe. Wait for jg etc. The only time I feel a dodge is justified is if you have troll pick/toxic teammates you know you can't win with. Other than that.

I dont think its really a disadvantage at all its just forcing me to play smarter, and not go all in for that kill I would try if I were playing against lux. I actually played ziggy this morning. Started 2-2 in lane down by like 10 cs or so.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
