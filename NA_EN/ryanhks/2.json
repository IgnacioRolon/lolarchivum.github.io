I understand why armor pen isn&#039;t a thing anymore. I would do almost true damage once I backed for a dirk or finished ghostblade. But when lethality was first introduced, It felt useless. Even if I hit both shurikans and an e, it was very unrewarding damage. Made Annie a better assassin then zed. I ended up abandoning ship and sticking with jg until it was buffed. And with the mastery damage also getting nerfed, as well as black cleaver (on zed). I feel without a slight buff, I&#039;m goin to have to shelve zed again. My buff ideas are to cut the w cd from 22/20/18/16/14 to 17/16/15/14/13. And buff the 2nd shurikan to 85% damage. Up from 75%","replies":[]}
