It said:\"We're unable to log you in because you may be offline\". I looked that up and i didn't find any solution that helped. Then i started poking around client and i think i changed server(mine is euw) then i changed it back. Then,previous issue was gone and client was ready to update(it went to older version and said it would try to update again or smth.).
