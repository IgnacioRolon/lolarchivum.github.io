However, the reset at the beginning of Season 8 (next season) isn't a hard reset. You'll be reset to a position relative to your current skill (your MMR). So while you can no longer earn Season 7 rewards, you can still work on your placements during pre-season (right now) for next season! Preseason games will have an impact on where you start for your placement matches next season!\n\nBest of luck for Season 8! {{sticker:sg-kiko}}","replies":[{"poster":"skarclasher","date":"2017-11-19T00:09:57.088+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thanks","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-17T05:15:10.731+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The ranked season ended on Nov 7th and the ranks were locked in.
