That way, the skins can still be sought after without having them removed. There is that gratifying feeling when you play an old skin that no one on your team has seen before.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sukishoo","date":"2014-11-16T02:42:51.268+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A lot of them are older skins (Freljord Ashe, Longhorn Alistar, Recon Teemo, ect) that aren't often bought anyway. They do this every once in awhile to kind of give a bit more rare feeling to those older skins and make way for plenty of newer skins.\n\nI for one own Freljord Ashe, APK Amumu, Bilgerat Rumble, Executioner Mundo, Glacial Olaf and Tempest Janna out of the bunch and while those are some great skins a few of those champions have newer and better skins.","replies":[]},{"poster":"welplayd","date":"2014-11-16T02:38:53.801+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Bump....and i would also like to add...are these skins going to get the legacy treatment for those people who have owned them prior to the announcement?","replies":[{"poster":"Sukishoo","date":"2014-11-16T02:40:35.284+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There was no \"legacy treatment\" there was the \"Vintage treatment\" on Limited Edition skins.
