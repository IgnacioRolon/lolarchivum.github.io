Balance has more to do with how people really _feel_ than actual numbers. To give an example in my eyes players are more likely to tilt, play bad and then blame the champion when the champion has recently been nerfed. The difference in performance may be EXTREMELY small but people, when it's a nerf, will think it's big especially when it's a champion _they_ play. The only place where balance _might_ be perfect or able to reach such a state is in pro play.\n\nI mean there will always be flavor of the month champs. It could be that champion(Q)=champion(W) but because champion(W) has a 30% play rate people WILL say they are broken.","replies":[]},{"poster":"6Sfool","date":"2017-02-10T14:02:57.102+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rock paper scissors is perfectly balanced, there's still a reason to pick one over the other.  If League was perfectly balanced, then you would pick champs based off their interaction with your team, the enemy team, and whoever you're best at, rather than whoever is plainly overtuned.\n\nIf the game was perfectly balanced, there would still be counters and synergy, but in moderation.

If that happened then people would pick the ones that have visual stimuli that give them an advantage, such as champions with a lot of red and that are large and threatening.\n\nIf you mean balanced around a power budget then people would only play the hardest characters to counter and the counters to that champion.\n\nIf you mean having a perfect 50% win rate, then they would play the easiest champions to hit that 50% win rate with, or fruitlessly try to break that rate with a high skill cap champ.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2017-02-10T08:28:53.935+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because if A and B have the same power budget, it doesn't mean they are identical, it just means they are equally effective in what they are designed to do.\n\nThis is also why teambuilding is a thing, because champs are far from being perfect who could do everything effectively.\n\nThat's the idea anyway.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Variks the Loyal","date":"2017-02-10T08:25:14.693+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Perfect balance?\n\nI would vary my pick based on who wants to play what.
