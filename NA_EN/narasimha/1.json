You could make the same argument about some runes or masteries - small things add up. \n\nIf you believe it has no impact and no one would notice either way, why have it in there to begin with? It serves no positive role and negatively affects the integrity of the game. While I think it's inexcusable for this to apply in ranked, I don't think it's fair in ANY mode.

They do add up and sometimes your team as a whole can get something they shouldn't even if that individual didn't. I've certainly seen people survive on 5 hp before. And again, if your argument is that it makes no difference, then it SHOULD NOT EXIST by virtue of that same logic. It's merely another source of potential controversy regarding ranked integrity. \n\nWhy open that can of worms for something which \"doesn't matter\"? If that's true, why would the person with the skin have any qualms about removing this? There is no world where someone can come up with a good justification for paid \"cosmetic\" addons to affect performance in any objective way while claiming that competitive integrity matters. It violates every principle of a fair game just by virtue of existing to ANY degree. It's much more of a philosophical issue than it is a practical one.

For example, 1 point in Unyielding is 1% BONUS MR and Armor which for the first 10-15 minutes is usually not even a full Armor or MR point. Vampirism gives 0.4% Spellvamp and Lifesteal. Recovery gives 0.4 Hp per 5. Even this sunglass bonus will be worth more than one point in recovery over a typical fight duration. These masteries aren't even considered  weak. League is a game of small advantages. You could use the same logic about how missing 1 cs doesn't matter and so on but it all adds up, especially in the context of 5 people and if even one game out of a million is affected by such nonsense, it's already one too many.\n\n If it's \"for fun\" and yet \"isn't noticeable and doesn't matter at all,\" I don't see how it is any more interesting for those with the skin. It's certainly not more fun for Leona knowing her kit does a tiny bit less damage due to someone purchasing a skin. I think those other \"easter eggs\" are equally stupid if they exist in ranked and I'm extremely disappointed Riot even considered this, let alone implemented it. The fun part of cosmetic addons shouldn't be based on numbers in ANY way. They  can add some voiceover like \"Good thing I've got these shades.\" (hopefully something better than that) but touching the numbers is a fundamental and unjustifiable mistake for a competitive game. I will never agree about this and there is no valid defense for it. It is not harmless and is in fact a very worrying and dangerous addition, not only for its own sake due to the mindset which was necessary to consider this OK.","replies":[{"poster":"SergeantScuttler","date":"2016-10-17T12:04:14.089+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=DeathBurs7,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=9fFWtNhb,comment-id=00020000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2016-10-17T10:33:26.377+0000)\n>\n> Don&#x27;t try to argue, there is no discussion possible about the scale of the effect.

You get one point per level. This skin buff has a chance to be more impactful than one level's worth of masteries.
