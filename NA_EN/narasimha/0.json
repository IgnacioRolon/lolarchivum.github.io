I saw a friend playing it at school, though it looked fun, and downloaded it.  I think I read through all of the Journal of Justice issues on my second day of playing.  They were funny, interesting, and they made the game seem way more 'real' than a lot of other online games.  Sure, you were a really powerful 'hero'-type character like you are in most MMOs, but in the old lore that all made sense.  You were a Summoner.  You were strong, but you were not the 'only hope' for Runeterra.  You and your fellow Summoners worked to keep order through the Institute of War.  You commanded powerful 'Champions' to fight for you to solve political disputes.  Some of these Champions joined the League of Legends willingly (like Viktor, Sona, Caitlyn, Lulu, and Jax), while others were conscripted or forced into it (examples being Ezreal, Nocturne, Brand, Kayle, and Cho'Gath).  \n\nAs a Summoner, you were important.  You and your allies worked to keep the peace between the city-states.  You stopped the fighting in Kalamanda.  You ended the Noxian invasion of Ionia.  You kept dangerous creatures -whether from the Void, the Shadow Isles, or elsewhere- from bringing about destruction upon the world.  You worked behind the scenes to maintain order.  Whether or not others knew your name, you had an impact on things.  That concept seemed really cool to me when I started playing, and it still does.  I miss the old lore and I am slowly losing faith in Riot as time passes.  I don't think the ret-con needed to happen, but there's nothing I can do about that now.  The fact that we lost so much of what made the game interesting made me really ticked off for a while, but I had hopes Riot would replace what we lost with more content.  I am beginning to believe that will not happen.  \n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nThat said, I do like the game.  It's a lot of fun and while I may not agree with everything the Balance Team does, they do a relatively good job of keeping all the Champions relatively balanced.  I also like the variety of the Champions overall.  There are over 120, so you're pretty much guaranteed to find one you like.  For example, I really like the concepts of transhumanism and the Technological Singularity, the point in the near future where humanity will have to evolve artificially in order to live to their fullest potential.  I wrote a few papers on it in high school and kept researching it in college.  When I saw Viktor I knew that I had found the perfect Champion for me.  I love his lore, his theme, his personality, and pretty much everything else about him.  \n\nTo this day I still consider Viktor my best Champion, and I have a lot of fun playing as him.  It's fun to sort of get in character when in the game, and his complex lore makes that really easy.  In all honesty, if he had come out now and had the very short 'few sentences' type of lore that new and ret-conned champions have been getting, I don't think I'd have as much fun, and probably wouldn't have stuck with him (and the game in general) as long as I have.  For example...  *\"Viktor believes that humans are flawed and are inferior to machines.  He studied Techmaturgy in Zaun and came to the conclusion that in order for humanity to evolve and become perfect, they will need to relinquish their frail flesh bodies in favor of superior forms made of metal.  Through this \"Glorious Evolution\" mankind will forego the weaknesses of emotions and flesh and enter into a new age of wondrous techmaturgical advancement.\"*  I've tried to write in the style of the newer lore entries like Bard, Xerath, and Kalista.  It explains his basic theme, but it lacks a lot of the depth the original had.  If this was all that was available when I first joined the game, I don't think I would have stuck around for very long.  \n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nTL;DR:  I got into this game because of the lore, and I think a lot of what made this game interesting is being slowly leeched away.  I still have some faith in Riot, but this can only last so long.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ternt","date":"2015-05-04T14:02:16.138+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I told my friends I would be better than them even though they played for 3 years.
