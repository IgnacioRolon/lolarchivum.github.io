Jumped on my comp tonight and went to play some League. Client launched and began scanning files. Looked like just a new update. Got to the end and an error popped up: \r\n\r\n\"Unspecified error occurred. Please check the logs for more information.\" \r\n\r\nThere is a \"Retry\" button under that but I can click it a hundred times and it just flashes backup again. I don't know how to resolve this or HOW to check the logs (or even how to interpret what they say!). Has anyone else had this happen or have any insight? I have a screen shot I will try to post just for a visual. \r\n\r\nAny help would be greatly appreciated!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-17T22:44:08.546+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The specific issue causing this can vary depending on when the error occurred.
