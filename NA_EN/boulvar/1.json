I recently purchased a new MSI gaming laptop. I've had it for 11 or so days. Initially I had zero issues. As of last night and today, however, I have a reoccurring problem: when I go to play, I get to the load screen, I see the portraits of each champion and my screen flickers (reminds me as if I was alt+tabbing). It flickers from load screen back to desktop (or browser page) five or six times. Finally, on the last flicker I get a blue screen saying my system has crashed and needs to restart. Video card drivers are up to date, league is up to date, I don't experience this issue with any other game, PUBG runs flawless, CoH, D3....this error ONLY happens with League. Any help or guidance? Literally thinking about returning this I am so frustrated. Really need a hand here. Thanks ahead of time.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-12T01:18:42.546+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That definitely sounds like Windows is having some major issues with League running properly for some reason. There's a number of different things that could be causing this like driver issues, overheating, or possibly corrupted files. Let's start with some of the basic steps by going through this [**FPS guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting). Follow each of those steps testing them in a custom/practice game, and let me know if that helps or not.","replies":[{"poster":"Boulvar","date":"2017-10-12T02:34:25.808+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I appreciate the info! I actually got on with live chat and they walked me through some things, uninstalled my video card and re-installed drivers. Just got done with a game, zero issues, so HOPEFULLY going forward, the issue is resolved! Was so happy when the load screen didn't start flickering!!! Thanks guys!","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-12T02:43:50.922+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sweetness!
