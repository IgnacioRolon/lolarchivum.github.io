I had no problem playing other games. It only freezes during first ban  when the timer gets to 27 second. I shouldn't use the word disconnected. Because my game only froze and I couldn't exit out the game by pressing x and also when I turn league back on  I was logged in and inside a lobby with 6 minutes timer. I also tried it on other different accounts it is only when timer gets to 27 second my whole game freezes\n","replies":[]}]}]}
