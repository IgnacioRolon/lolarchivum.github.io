Many have pointed out that there are some flaws and I'm here to discuss those issues and solutions to address them.\r\n \r\nThe official public chat rooms have grown rife with RP sellers, scammers and Elo-boost spam. The default four rooms we established can be used by a tiny fraction of our players at a time. Given the number of League players, most conversation spills into private, community-created rooms. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, private chat rooms and even the awesome community hubs like Dominate Dominion and Summoner School lack moderation tools beyond the ignore button. While the experience in private chat rooms is better than the public versions, we still want to provide tools to address unwelcome drop-ins and toxic behavior.\r\n\r\nLong term we’re exploring and working on major and minor improvements to chat and chat rooms aimed at enhancing usability and adding new functionality. \r\n \r\nAs an immediate action we’re going to disable the public chat rooms until they’re useful and accessible. In their current shape they just don’t work and can actively create negative experiences for many players (especially new players). \r\n\r\nWe’ll keep all private chat rooms and messaging available to everyone, and bring the official public chat rooms back as soon as we can.\r\n \r\nNow that we’ve talked about the current state of chat and some of our first steps, I want to explore what our goals for chat are.\r\n \r\nWe’d like to create a persistent hangout for the friends you play with. Those friends should bring in their like-minded friends as well, and the badass players you meet playing great games. While you're at it, why not invite some players from the community as well?\r\n \r\nAt the end of the day, when you log in you should feel like you're surrounded by active players that like to play League the way you do. You should be to able jump easily into games with those friends - - without having to send game invites one by one.\r\n \r\nWhether we call them chat rooms, hangouts or communities, they could grow to serve many purposes. Players could build a community for junglers, a mentoring group, a champion theory-crafting channel, or casual ARAM or Team Ranked LFGs. Some great communities like these already exist in League but it's not easy to manage them well. \r\n \r\nWhen we think about these social spaces, we think a good starting point to solve the existing problems is a solid set of tools that empowers players and Riot to create, own, and manage all kinds of different social environments.\r\n \r\nRight now we’re looking for your feedback. Tell us what you’re looking for in our chat rooms, and how we can provide you with the right tools to make them into strong communities. We'll work on the improvements at a steady pace, and keep you posted along the way. Join the discussion below!\r\n \r\nThanks, Riot Metasystem","replies":[{"poster":"Humpelstilzche","date":"2014-07-01T12:46:40.356+0000","up_votes":45,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi,\n\nI am the manager of a 3700 member community (Liga der Gentlemen, LdG) that mainly uses the chatrooms to organize games. We've done this for over 2 years now, so i have a bit of experience with these rooms. Additionally me and the other german emissaries had a project were we tried to help people in a chatroom (why was i banned? How does matchmaking work? This kind of questions) in the client. This project failed, due to the nature of the chatrooms. \n\nThanks to this experience, i have can give you some feedback:\n\n* Chatrooms need to be variable in size. While a chatroom with 50 people just chatting with each other is spammed with lots of text, a chatroom to find people to play with (like the one we use in the LdG) could easily stand 500 people. Especially at peak hours, a limit to 200 members is just not enough for bigger communities. \n* Chatrooms need basic moderation tools. The owner (and chosen moderators) has to be able to kick and ban people temporarily and permanently from the chatroom. These bans have to be revoceable. \n* Big chatrooms might profit from an optional tool that limits the messages people can send in a given time (quite similiar to chat-restrictions). \n* It would be good to be able to decide whether a chatroom is open for everyone or just for people you invite. \n* The open version would need a blacklist, that denies access for people on that list while letting everbody else in (pretty much like bans, but usable before these people even visited the chatroom). \n* automated spam-protection\n\nOptional (not as important as the ones above):\n\n* Beeing able to whisper people who are in the same room, but not on your FL\n* Hide or even kick people who are inactive for too long\n\nThese tools are pretty much necessary for bigger communities, if they want to use Riots chatrooms. My community, the LdG, uses the chatrooms right now. It works, because we are a behavior-focused community. But we are still at the mercy of trolls and flamers. It does not happen very often, but flamers are able to destroy our chatroom completely if they want to. Even one single person can do that. The other project i mentioned, the emissary help channel, had to be shut down because of it. There were a handful of people who were able to destroy this quite liked project completely, which was really frustrating. \n\nI am really looking forward to a chat system rework, because communities like ours desperately need it. \nGreetings\nHumpel\n\n\nPS: If you want further feedback, you can contact me anytime. The european Rioters have all my contact data if you need it.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Metasystem","date":"2014-07-07T23:14:21.900+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> * Chatrooms need to be variable in size.

This is also where we get started on the improvements. Ban lists might not be the best or the only solution as they're easy enough to work around but the ease of community self-management is key. \n\n> * It would be good to be able to decide whether a chatroom is open for everyone or just for people you invite. \n\nWe quite agree.

When creating a guild, you spend an upfront of in game currency in order to secure a title, and then had to find several members to join before the guild could be fully formed. I am not looking up, nor looking to argue, exactly how this functions now, or if these events are backwards, as that would not change my point.\n\nThis sort of system, if implemented in League, could allow us, as a community, to create groups of similar minded individuals. For example, if Adam was to create a \"TFORCE\" community, for a set amount of RP or IP, he would have owner's rights to that community. As owner, he could designate power, such as moderation, to those that he wanted to dole out the power to (so nobody, in this case... kidding of course). The price should not be high enough to make communities cost prohibitive, but should also not be low enough that \"troll groups\" form. There needs to be a high enough price so that creating and managing these groups is a decision that wouldn't necessarily be done on a whim.\n\nFurthermore, within this same vein of logic, if multiple people wanted to create a community, perhaps they could share the initial cost. This would allow for many more sub communities to form among friends.\n\nThis is just my two cents, take it for what it's worth, but I really think that there is quite a bit that focusing on the chat as a possibility for expanding communities could really benefit from.\n\nAs a final food for thought, perhaps, highly rated communities (such as TFORCE, wink wink) could be \"Featured\" within the main client, or, for newer communities, possibly, \"Sponsored,\" through RP/IP (again, potential to cost-share between members).\n\n**TL;DR: Communities should have a start up \"cost,\" RP/IP, that keeps them from being an \"at whim\" decision. This allows for greater focus on communities with value behind them, due to the nature of investing in the community itself from the beginning.**","replies":[{"poster":"r xy","date":"2014-07-01T05:18:43.041+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I personaly dont like gateing something like this with RP and makeing chat something to pay for this way and with IP gateing we have the problem that there are many players that have everything they could buy with IP so they dont care about spending any amount of it they want, so there would still be 'troll-groups'","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Riot Metasystem","date":"2014-07-07T23:08:59.650+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> My only concern is that I will not be able to claim the channel that I started (TFORCE) in game.

I run **[Factions](http://LeagueFactions.net)**, a community game mode based on (e.g.) Noxus vs. Demacia matches. Chat is a huge part of our infrastructure, so I'm very interested in this discussion.\n\n**[Factions Chat](http://leaguefactions.net/chat/)**\n\nWe currently have about 150 people in our chat on average. We use it as a hub for discussion and a place to arrange Factions matches (e.g. \"Looking for 3 more for Ionia\").\n\nSo far, we haven't been seriously spammed or anything, though it is a concern. We also haven't needed \"hard\" moderation tools yet. Still, it might be nice if we could somehow \"claim\" a chat and assign mod/admin powers.\n\nThis might be rather Factions-specific, but chat tags on the \"who\" list would be nice for us. Maybe allow us to have little colored dots or icons? It might have some general usefulness; e.g., in Summoner School, new people could select a bright green dot, while experienced \"teachers\" could have a purple dot. In the case of Factions, we'd use it to indicate faction: e.g. gray for Noxus, blue for Demacia.","replies":[{"poster":"501st Big Mike","date":"2014-07-02T00:40:28.837+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like the idea of a tagging someone as new or experienced, would definitely help people group up into games, whether they want a \"teaching\" match or people similar to their skill level.

Showing a indicator that shows how experienced someone is could lead to lower level players being ignored or harassed by other players. \n\nThis would probably be a bigger problem in public chat rooms than private ones.

Even other chat communities may enjoy having a system to tell who the person in charge of a group is, and it will help the newer members be noted and given explanations of how the group works.\n\nNow, I am admittedly slightly concerned about a random person logging in first and then creating a dominance over a chat, especially since people will almost certainly take over a well-known chat room and force the regulars to create a new chat.  The IP buying of a chat would have the pro of making sure that the owner of the chat would always have a measure of control, but this may also lead to someone buying the chat first, or similar issues, and seems a bit like first-come first-serve.  I'm just throwing my two cents out, but maybe creating a chat room would require Riot to verify the owner or something similar if the chat had say, 100 people in it, to ensure smoother running over a larger community group.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Mythinite","date":"2014-07-01T13:11:36.608+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well this is a pleasant surprise! As the Community Manager of The Gentlemen's Club chat room, I have had many first hand experiences with all sorts of troublemakers: Trolls, spammers, flooders, scammers, etc. I would be happy to share some ideas (in no particular order).\n\n**Chat Room Registration** - The ability to register and claim \"ownership\" over a private chat room is essential. Existing chat rooms will need help against troll registrations when the system is implemented though. This would allow the chat room owner/admin to assign a team with moderation powers.  \n\n**Chat Room Moderation** - The ability to kick/ban users as the absolute minimum. Additional tools might include warning and muting players, or the ability to use time limited bans/mutes.\n\n**Flood Protection** - Some basic flood protection or message queue (possibly moderator enabled) would be nice.\n\n**Increased User Limit** - We have hit the user limit before and with increased chat room visibility in the future I predict many chat rooms will have this issue.\n\n**Reporting** - The ability to report players from the chat room, similar to the post game screen. This could either be reports sent to Riot, or more likely, reports sent to the channel moderators (in case they aren't around). A report should automatically include recent chat logs, or alternatively, all chat activity could be logged for the moderators to peruse if necessary.\n\n**Chat Room Profiles** - Give owners the ability to set up a chat room profile similar to summoner profiles. Allow us to add/display a channel description/keywords, list of moderators, URL/Facebook page, VoIP information and similar. You could also add meta information for the channel (founder, age), channel statistics (unique users, user activity/hour, games played). I'm sure you could even come up with some sort of chat room meta “game” if you were so inclined. Allow chat rooms to compete against one another during holiday events? The possibilities are endless.\n\n**Chat Room Visibility** - In their current state, chat rooms are strictly word of mouth. Promote their use in various ways. A searchable list of chat rooms would be a good start, with one-click-buttons for joining or reading the chat room profile. You could also allow players to list their favorite chat rooms as part of their information on post game screens, as a sort of “guild tag”.\n\n**Chat Room Topic** - Allow the owners to show a message to all chat room users, either when they join or as a timed broadcast.\n\n**Chat Room LFG** - A LFG/private game creation tool. Allow users to create community games that are automatically broadcast in the chat room, with one-click-join functionality for other players.\n\n**Some requests from our users** - Voice in chat rooms. Multiple open (not minimized) chat rooms. Chats detachable from main client window. Chat rooms accessible while in a game. “Children” chat rooms belonging to the main chat room without the need for additional registrations.\n\nI am very excited for this news and very happy that you are requesting our input on the matter.

When changing the system it could cause a lot of additional troll too with  people stealing names of existing communities.\n\n**Problems with the change**\n\nIn the past you changed the Chatroomsystem atleast 3 times. From case sensitve to insensitve and back again. In the clans we had at that time it caused quite a bunch of problems of people staying in the old chatrooms/some in the new ones.

I believe that it would be nice if a group of players could be the \"admins\" of the chatroom and then be able to ban/unban players from it. Anyway, I feel concerned about the possibility of those admins are hacked by a troll and then the troll bans everyone out, or something like that. This way, i think that we should have some way of defending our chatroom in case of hacking/troll, but something that does not put in risk the chatroom (DD chat has been used since dominion started, and a lot of players would lose contact with community if it was disabled, mainly the older ones who wish to come back into play).","replies":[]},{"poster":"50m3rand0mn00b","date":"2014-12-09T13:44:49.569+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"At least it's not gone for good, but is there any news on when this is coming back?

They have a low self esteem and have absolutely no respect for the enemy team especially when they are winning or have won the game. You point out a flaw after losing and they verbally harass you to an extreme that just makes you want to quit the game altogether. Despite all of the unskilled and troll players in this game, the players that i hate the most are the ones who have no honor for the enemy team or respect at all. They also brag like crazy about winning like it's something that they strive and excel in for life, which most players don't become actual pro's. I feel that i am just going to quit playing this game for this exact reason. It makes me want to win games so i end up becoming obsessed  with trying to win game after game and only end up with 60 to 70% losses if not 50% so you really never climb at all. These type of players cause me to abuse the game. They just have to constantly say ignorant things like QQ for example and i find that very immature. I should not have to mute players like this all of the time, otherwise i might as well be muting the entire team. So please riot, make a better effort when monitoring or taking a closer look at players who are reported for verbal harassment, because i can guarantee you these are the type of players that I am talking about. Not all of them are like this, but a HUGE amount of them are. I would have to guess at least 20 to 30% of them, which is a very large percentage if you have played the game in ranked or 5v5.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Math Test","date":"2014-08-12T17:25:12.909+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This was posted a month ago, and I think its amazing that this is ***finally*** being looked at. I am curious to know, just for the sake of knowing, what made chatrooms and that functionality so low on the priority list when compared to the bigger issues (design, balance, etc) this seems like really small picking. I remember doing chat systems for a basic programming clan and adding moderator authority and bans and such was fairly easy and when stored took up an negligible amount of space, even for larger rooms. Is there a reason Riot has waited this long to address the issue, or are they addressing it because the amount of spam in their own rooms is getting out of hand?\n\nI hope this is implemented soon so we wont have the {{champion:21}} of having to listen to more bots. I also hope my comment doesn't {{champion:222}} the chances of this coming sooner than Soon (TM).

This should also be an option in private rooms, even if the max number in those rooms goes up.\n\nAnother mini-suggestion: Perhaps there can be a function to make chat rooms publicly visible to accounts with preselected qualities - \"lowelo\" be visible to accounts gold and below, or \"noob\" available to players 29 and below. \n\nThe second suggestion assumes that privately made chat rooms will have an option to become public, which I think is important for having an active, dynamic chat room system that is readily accessible to the general LoL playerbase, instead of having 4 rooms of 200 people try to serve for the needs of 4mil+ people. If a player wants to find mentoring, he should be able to search and find a room for him. Same for someone who might want to find a LoL fanart group, or find people to premade with who are also basketball fans, etc.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PaperMache7","date":"2014-07-01T04:27:44.169+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really wish you'd be able to build an actual community via a channel (think of a clan).
