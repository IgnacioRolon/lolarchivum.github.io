Let me pull up your account to see what's happening.\r\n\r\nLeeOwnYa\r\nYour great !!\r\n\r\nM0useRat\r\nwas it the Hextech Ward Skin you are talking about?\r\n\r\nLeeOwnYa\r\nYeppers\r\nAmong others that I crafted in the reg store with essence's but at the moment I would be just thrilled for this one at the moment\r\nThe super exclusive Hex Tech Ward that requires Magical gemstones that drop from secret Hex tech Chests dug strait out of Summoners rift cliftsides and valleys\r\n\r\nM0useRat\r\nWhen you purchased the ward skin did it take away your gemstones? I'm not seeing any transaction that has it.\r\n\r\nLeeOwnYa\r\nYep it sure did\r\nIf you would be so kind as to look at my purchase history you will see it I bought it about a week and a half ago im guessing\r\n\r\nM0useRat\r\nAlrighty, I'm diving in. It looks like you've done a lot of hextech crafting today.\r\n\r\nLeeOwnYa\r\ni do a lot yes\r\n:)\r\nI have no need for real money so why not give it to you guys and get some super cool in -game items\r\nI kid you know that .... HAHAHA\r\nThose gems are rediculas to get that's why i am connecting with you\r\nridiculous  **\r\n\r\nM0useRat\r\nHaha, I know. I'm trying to find it but no luck so far.\r\n\r\nLeeOwnYa\r\nill copy paste it\r\n9/8/17\r\n\r\nM0useRat\r\nAha!\r\nI found it\r\nIt was pretty deep in there. That's why it threw me off.\r\n\r\nLeeOwnYa\r\neven the one i made today with the weird looking thing is not available\r\nYa sry about that :)\r\nI tried reclogging to see if that did anything and sadly it did not help :(\r\nrelogging**\r\n\r\nM0useRat\r\nAwesome!\r\nCould I have you try a custom and see if you can select it?\r\n\r\nLeeOwnYa\r\nsure\r\nyour the man/woman!!!!!\r\n\r\nM0useRat\r\nIt works?!?!?!\r\n\r\nLeeOwnYa\r\nYes\r\nYou rock!!\r\nYep i selected it and it also let me place it in the game\r\n\r\nM0useRat\r\nWoohoo!\r\n\r\nLeeOwnYa\r\n:)\r\n\r\nM0useRat\r\nIs there anything else I can help you out with?\r\n\r\nLeeOwnYa\r\nJust a quick question\r\nWere you able to get the others to work as well?\r\nI have such a short window to select it i could not really look very well\r\nI will just try another match real fast\r\n\r\nM0useRat\r\nAll your wards should be working :) If you run into any others that aren't let me know!\r\n\r\nLeeOwnYa\r\nWow\r\nThey all there\r\nFar as i can tell\r\nWell it is my personal opion you need a promotion to \"Superhelperextrordinar\" riot boss\r\n\r\nM0useRat\r\nHaha, what would that include?\r\n\r\nLeeOwnYa\r\nPaid neck massages while you keep helping the needy whiney and sometimes cry bb players of this awesome game we call lulz\r\nAnd some free rp\r\nAnd some extra cash in that check every week to help out dat fam\r\n\r\nM0useRat\r\nHaha that would be quite the deal.\r\n\r\nLeeOwnYa\r\nThat's just the start\r\nYou could even get like a blinking light near your desk so that when people call in they know the \"Superhelperextrordinar\" riot boss is hard at work and people should take notes\r\n\r\nM0useRat\r\nI think you're onto something ;)\r\n\r\nLeeOwnYa\r\nThat's could even be the que to the start of the neck massage\r\nAfter all im sure you perform even better when you are relaxed and focused only on helping the  needy whiney and sometimes cry bb players of this awesome game we call lulz\r\n\r\nM0useRat\r\nThis is quite the idea haha. I think this could definitely make games less toxic. How much RP would it be?\r\n\r\nLeeOwnYa\r\nHmmm that's a good question\r\nI think you should get at least 1350 a week\r\nYou could get a decent amount of skins all year for that\r\nIt has taken me almost 7 years to get what i have\r\nAnd umm *cough * thousands of those things they call dollars\r\n\r\nM0useRat\r\nOh wow, yes you have been a very loyal customer.\r\n\r\nLeeOwnYa\r\nYeppers\r\nI have more than one account\r\nAppearntlly you can only spend 1500 a month on one account\r\nfound that out last month\r\n\r\nM0useRat\r\nWow, that's impressive. Gotta get all the good skins ^_^\r\n\r\nLeeOwnYa\r\nOr max Transactions anyway it says\r\nWell I want to get all the skins on this account\r\nlike i did when I got all the champs\r\nIts a lot easier to keep up with them if you don't have to go backwards and play catch up\r\n\r\nM0useRat\r\nNice, I almost have all the champions but I can't imagine getting all the skins.\r\nThere's so many!\r\n\r\nLeeOwnYa\r\nI know :)\r\n\r\nM0useRat\r\nWell my friend, I wish you the best of luck on your journey.\r\n\r\nLeeOwnYa\r\nSome i don't really care for but the new ones are getting better and better,\r\nYou as well thank you so much for all your help\r\n\r\nM0useRat\r\nMy pleasure! I'm glad we got your wards working again.\r\n\r\nLeeOwnYa\r\nIf you need anything just give me a shout\r\n\r\nM0useRat\r\nYou know it! Have a good one.\r\n\r\nLeeOwnYa\r\nYou can friend me in game or pass along the msg about the promotion\r\nI would be happy to tell anyone who will listen","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-19T22:28:37.968+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ayyyyy ol' MouseRat is a good one, I'll make sure to pass along the suggestion and see about finding him that blinking light xD!","replies":[]},{"poster":"LeeOwnYa","date":"2017-09-19T23:31:43.325+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"HAHAHAHA \n\nIf I did not think I would get fired for playing Lulz all day I would have already applied for a job.\nMe and MOuseRat  would get along just fine.
