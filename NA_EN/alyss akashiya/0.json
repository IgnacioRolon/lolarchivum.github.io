It wasn't an aggressive \"Go AFK\", it was \"Go, it's fine\".\n\n\"Think for 1s about fighting a yi with ult up XD\" was in response to his support (who was the actual toxic person, since every time someone died/misplayed they'd get yelled at) yelling at him for walking away instead of killing the Yi. They both survived the Yi engage, Yi wasted his abilities and his flash, but the support decided to harass him over it and so he replied with that. That's not harassing. Telling your teammate to think about the circumstance is not harassing them.\n\n\"Stop talking to me. You're a random in a 4man. You're being told you're wrong. Stop talking.\" has the same effect of \"play the game, stop typing\". I don't see how that's flaming or harassing. Because, again, despite it not being shown, the support was spending more time typing and attacking us than playing the game. So much so that they wound up with an awful assist score since they'd sit back from teamfights, typing.\n\nAs for the latter two, I don't.. get.. how mentioning that the person's been harassing him is harassing them back. Especially when the person starts begging in all-chat for both him and I to be reported. We were both talking at the support, we were both typing about the same things. I'm sitting here with no punishment, he's sitting there with a permaban. It's undeserved and unjust. I'll say it again, Alyss was told to get a lobotomy, to kill himself, and was called a r%%%%%. Saying \"Shut up, stop typing\" _is nowhere near the same vein._ And y'know what? The person saying all those things **_did not get any punishment,_** I know this because no instant feedback report came up.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Alyss Akashiya","date":"2019-08-16T00:51:26.713+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"if taking the rune DH is trolling and i am returning to this behavior for playing the game in a fun manor trying to win and doing well in it is trolling then i must have been trolling","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-08-16T00:40:17.402+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"you got permbanned for flaming all game, after multiple warnings, including the previous one that stated you would be banned for any further infractions.

That's unfortunate, and I'm sorry you had to deal with it. If this misbehavior happened in chat (including emotes or ping) and they don't respond positively to a _single, courteous, constructive request to focus on the game_, your best option is to mute that player. Submit a report after the match. This is equivalent to dealing with a noisy person in a library by asking them to keep it down and then notifying library staff and moving to another area.\n\n_Do not respond with misbehavior of your own!_ If you do that, your teammates may mute and report _you_, and those reports would be valid. This is equivalent to dealing with a noisy person in a library by getting into a shouting match with them. Just because someone else started it doesn't justify you in continuing it. I'm sure you're familiar with the \"s/he started it\" trope, where two children get into an argument or fight and then try to claim innocence of any wrongdoing by claiming that they didn't instigate it. As any parent, teacher, or other supervisor of children will tell you, that excuse doesn't fly. When Dad is trying to drive you to Disneyland and your annoying brother starts making faces at you as he's previously been told not to, you should calmly ask him to stop, and then, if that doesn't work, calmly notify your parents of the problem. Making faces at him or shouting at him has never been a good way to get him to stop, and it makes you just as guilty of that as he.\n\nRiot doesn't care who started it. Someone else's misbehavior does not justify your own.\n\nFrom [Riot's support knowledgebase](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207489286-Instant-Feedback-System-FAQ-):\n\n> * Simply speaking, retaliation is not an acceptable or justifiable behavior. An argument between two players can easily create a negative experience for the rest of the players in the game with you. Regardless of the other player’s actions, this does not justify your own behavior. You alone are responsible for your actions within the game.If you encounter a toxic player like this, the best option is to simply report their behavior and move on.\n> * Reports are a vital piece to the puzzle. If you are not sure of what sort of behavior is reportable take a look at the [Reporting a Player FAQ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752884-Reporting-a-Player)\n\nIf you misbehave but a teammate or opponent does or says something even worse, you should definitely report them after the match, just as someone reported you for your own misbehavior. Yes, that's certainly possible. Reports are not a limited resource. Any time someone believes that another player violated LoL's behavioral standards, they can report that player. Punishments are similarly not limited: if more than one player in a game merits a punishment, they can both get a punishment. This can happen even if the players in question were antagonizing each other. The IFS doesn't need to weigh the severity of all reported players' actions and then \"award\" the \"winner\" with a punishment; it's not a contest.\n\nThink of it like dealing with a noisy person in a library: ask them to keep it down, and then notify library staff and move to another area if that doesn't work. If you get into a shouting match with them, you're just as likely to be removed, even if you weren't shouting _quite_ as loudly as they were. The goal is a quiet library.\n\nThe only chat messages included in your chat log are your own for a single, extremely good reason: they are the only ones taken into account for your punishment, because they're the only ones in your control. The things other players said and did in your match might produce in you an impulse to do certain things that may include breaking LoL's rules, but your behavior is your own, and you are responsible for it. If you really think about it, this is a good thing. If a toxic player's goading could exempt you from punishment for your flaming them, calling for reports, etc., then it would logically go the other way as well, resulting in punishments for players who didn't necessarily break any rules but weren't quite as friendly and positive as their teammates. Can you imagine a world where \"didn't participate in the dance party and ignored all of our jokes\" was a valid report that could get someone suspended for two weeks? We don't want that situation anymore than we want \"called our support a braindead waste of space\" to be considered an _invalid_ report just because, say, the support was telling their team to harm themselves while they merrily ran it down mid.\n\nYou weren't punished for misbehaving in one game. You were punished for misbehaving in _one more_ game, in a consistent pattern of negative behavior that breaks the game's rules. Additionally, the reform card doesn't always show all the logs that led to your punishment: it randomly selects up to several logs. You might see three logs, but you also might see as few as one, even for players whose punishment stems not from a small number of egregious infractions but rather from dozens of instances of mild toxicity. The purpose of the reform card is to tell you how to reform, so it shows you an example of the behavior that prompted your punishment and explains that such behavior is inappropriate and should be avoided if you want to maintain an account in good standing.\n\nUsually, one transgression by itself wouldn't be enough to bring such a punishment to an otherwise clean account, but the IFS works on an escalating punishment system. Breaking a minor rule, like engaging the team in useless arguments, has a minor punishment: a chat restriction. Breaking that same rule over and over again, however, doesn't prompt an endless series of chat restrictions. The severity of the punishment ramps up over time, because the goal is to eliminate the punished player's willingness to break the game's rules. If two chat restrictions don't stop the useless arguments, the system will increase the punishment to a 14-day suspension and deliver a very clear message that the continued rule-breaking is becoming a serious issue and any further instances will result in a permaban. Again, the point is to put a stop to this misbehavior. If a player is more interested in repeatedly breaking the rules than in maintaining access to their account, they'll lose access to their account.\n\nOf course, it's possible to break major rules, like cheating, threatening people, or using chat for hate speech, and skip punishment tiers so that a clean account ends up with a 14-day suspension or even a permaban.\n\nFrom [Riot's support knowledgebase](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207489286-Instant-Feedback-System-FAQ-):\n\n> **PUNISHMENTS GENERALLY FOLLOW A BASIC ESCALATION PATH:**\n> \n> * First Offense: 10 Game Chat Restriction\n> * Second Offense: 25 Game Chat Restriction\n> * Third Offense: Two Week Suspension\n> * Fourth Offense: Permanent Suspension\n> \n> However, it is possible to skip to a Two Week or Permanent suspension based on the severity of the behavior in the game. Excessive negative behavior can result in a Two-Week or Permanent suspension at any time without having a chat restriction on the account.\n\nI'm sorry you've seen worse, but the system wants your behavior to be _acceptable_, not just _less unacceptable_ than what you have seen in others.\n\nYou got back from a 14-day ban less than a week ago, and then the entirety of your chat consists of spam (\"do u have a problem?\" with each word on a separate line), argument, harassment (\"stfu\" etc.), announcements of intent to report, and accusations against teammates (calling them trolls). You announced \"muted report\" but then didn't actually mute. Why not? That just makes the argument worse instead of ending it. Literally not a single chat message you sent during the entire match was actually positive, constructive, or worthwhile.\n\nRiot doesn't care why you keep breaking the rules. They just want it to stop.","replies":[{"poster":"Alyss Akashiya","date":"2019-08-16T01:01:03.862+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"i did mute the player which u assumed that i didnt i muted the player when i had said \"muted report\" becuz i got tired of their harassment from the entire time playing the game and yes i put \"do u have a problem\" on each line due to it being a lobby with my 4 other friends and i was joking its not spamming to put a few words in separate lines and stfu isnt an argument i was trying to ask them to stop harassing me which they started telling me to \"lobotomize myself\" and this is the point where i went and stfu cuz i was tired of the constant abuse they had done to me, for the sole reason of im a gold player taking DH rune on varus\n\nalso yes im aware of the 4 punishments and how they work my arrangement is to get this looked into becuz this game is taken out of context which is exactly why i placed it up here there is 2 things that u pointed out right away i said \"muted report\" to attempt to have them stop harassing me and focus on the game so i may continue to communicate with my whole team and enjoy the game","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-08-16T01:33:24.086+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Alyss Akashiya,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=3dlHLtfT,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2019-08-16T01:01:03.862+0000)\n>\n> i did mute the player which u assumed that i didnt i muted the player when i had said \"muted report\" becuz i got tired of their harassment from the entire time playing the game and yes i put \"do u have a problem\" on each line due to it being a lobby with my 4 other friends and i was joking its not spamming to put a few words in separate lines and stfu isnt an argument i was trying to ask them to stop harassing me which they started telling me to \"lobotomize myself\" and this is the point where i went and stfu cuz i was tired of the constant abuse they had done to me, for the sole reason of im a gold player taking DH rune on varus\n> \n> also yes im aware of the 4 punishments and how they work my arrangement is to get this looked into becuz this game is taken out of context which is exactly why i placed it up here there is 2 things that u pointed out right away i said \"muted report\" to attempt to have them stop harassing me and focus on the game so i may continue to communicate with my whole team and enjoy the game\n\nYou said \"muted report\" but then continued arguing. That should've been the last thing you said if you had actually muted. How could you see their accusation of trolling, their \"shit talk,\" and their use of the r-word if you muted them?\n\nI guess one of your friends in lobby did indeed leave. And then you got an annoying person in your party. But even if we start at \"stop talking to me,\" your chat log still merited a punishment.\n\n\"stfu isn't an argument\" Think about this statement. Think hard.\n\nTelling people to \"stfu,\" announcing how you're going to report, etc. isn't going to get anyone to stop harassing you. None of the things you said or did in the whole match accomplished that, and yet you kept going. And this is far from the first time you've done so. If you don't like what you see in chat from someone, mute them. Similarly, Riot could see that none of the temporary punishments they were giving you accomplished the goal of getting you to improve your behavior, so they resorted to something that actually works: a permaban.\n\nIt sounds like you're actually not familiar with how the punishment system works. It doesn't take \"context\" into account because no context could excuse your behavior. I explained this above. You are, of course, free to submit a ticket to Riot support, but all they'll tell you is exactly what we're telling you right now: your behavior was not acceptable, you did not demonstrate reform, the punishment was valid, and so the permaban stands. You could then persist and keep replying to support, but eventually they would start auto-closing your tickets.

What was the purpose? You muted someone, and then kept responding to what they were saying? That feature doesn't work if you intentionally defeat it. If your friends insist on relaying to you the contents of muted player chat, you can mute them too. This won't block them, and won't carry over to future matches.\n\n> oh i dont need to think about this statement to know its not an argument it the attempt to stop one from beginning as well as clear demonstration of frustration and annoyance. could this be seen as toxic yes but tell me what do you think is toxic. a person telling another to kill themselves lobotomize themselves and hope they die or someone telling another to stfu cuz they are being complacently bulled all game\n\nJust because \"stfu\" isn't a sound logical argument doesn't mean you weren't trying to use it to continue an argument, which is what happened. If this ill-fated attempt to stop an argument didn't work, the answer is to _stop arguing_, not shrug your shoulders and dive into it.\n\nBoth of you misbehaved. There's no \"or\" here. Riot has enough bans in their ban bucket to punish anyone who breaks the rules.\n\n> you say this but if you looked at the whole log of everything that went down this game 80% of which if u look higher on other comments arent even in context so you say a perm ban works but its one sided no time stamps no explanations in context cuz there is no pings others words time stamps none of this so with out a doubt in my mind my account was banned today cuz a bot caught me repeating what another person had said to me due to my many messages plain and simple\n\nThere is no context because there's never any good reason to say e.g. \"stfu\" or most of the other things you said. You weren't banned because you accidentally repeated someone else's words. You were banned because you _believe_ that that, and not your extremely poor behavior over a long period, got you punished. Riot realized that you would never take responsibility for your actions and follow the rules.\n\n> THIS SENTENCE COULD NEVER BE MORE FALSE if i had an \"argument about game mechanics of how something worked\" i could get a ban/ chat system or a ban if the punishment is at that point\n\nIf you had a _polite discussion_ about game mechanics you wouldn't be punished. I have had many such discussions and never had a punishment. If, on the other hand, you and a teammate spend 15 minutes screaming about what items are best on X champion and \"that's a troll build\" and \"stop telling me what to do\" and \"why are you inting\" etc., that could be punished.\n\n> the problem with this system is useless and garbage the escalation on it is horrid. getting frustrated in the chat isnt anywhere the same as being toxic or harassing someone in the chat is.\n\nIf you \"get frustrated\" a little bit, sometimes, you don't get a punishment. My behavior isn't 100.0% perfect... but it's very close; close enough that I don't get a punishment. If you \"get frustrated\" on an ongoing basis and each instance involves a game-long shouting match, that will bring you toward a punishment, as you discovered.\n\n> let me ask u this is telling someone to go die in a hole toxic and harassing?\n\nYes.\n\n> if yes then let me ask this instead is telling someone that they are harassing someone thats not doing bad and talking shit about them before they have seen play toxic and harassing as well?\n\nYes.\n\n> the problem here with the system they get the same punishments which is the problem why isnt someone thats frustrated with another person behavior and toxicity being treated the exact same as the person thats telling some one to kill themselves and to die in a hole or to go lobotomize themselves? that is why im here im not arguing that no rules are broken here some are but context matters. it can change the whole outlook on a conversation.\n\nFrom [Riot's support knowledgebase](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207489286-Instant-Feedback-System-FAQ-):\n\n> **PUNISHMENTS GENERALLY FOLLOW A BASIC ESCALATION PATH:**\n> \n> * First Offense: 10 Game Chat Restriction\n> * Second Offense: 25 Game Chat Restriction\n> * Third Offense: Two Week Suspension\n> * Fourth Offense: Permanent Suspension\n> \n> However, it is possible to skip to a Two Week or Permanent suspension based on the severity of the behavior in the game. Excessive negative behavior can result in a Two-Week or Permanent suspension at any time without having a chat restriction on the account.\n\nFrom [Riot's support knowledgebase](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207489286-Instant-Feedback-System-FAQ-):\n\n> We have a zero-tolerance policy for extreme negative behavior as well as extremely offensive language and remarks made in game towards other players. Since it is a severe disregard for the Summoner’s Code this sort of behavior can result in skipping to a Two week or Permanent suspension. Suspensions of this degree based on negative behavior will not likely be reduced or removed.\n\nThe punishments are not always the same. Severe misbehavior brings a player toward a punishment more quickly.\n\n> lets say this a kid puts gum in a girls hair he gets detention the 1st time 2nd time he gets a week suspention the 3rd time what does he get shot in the face?? does he get expelled? no then why the fuck is the account permd????? it makes no sense i didn't tell anyone to kill themselves or harass anyone i displayed clear frustation and thats worthy of a perm? u have me tilted outa my mind more than anyone in any game of league and its nearly one of the most toxic games out there cuz the problems arent solved.\n> thats my problem here\n\n\"does he get expelled? no\" Actually, yes. If a behavior problem becomes so severe that the school can no longer deal with it, the expulsion system exists for that purpose.\n\nRiot told you to stop what you were doing and you didn't. Riot values all the other people in your games who have to deal with your aggravating chat more than they value the continued presence of someone who keeps breaking rules even when told to stop, so you are banned. Riot provides the mute function for people to silence occasional chat trolls, and they recently added the ability to disable chat entirely to help people who have difficulty controlling themselves and want to ensure that they don't say anything that could get them punished, but you failed to use those tools.\n\nAt the end of the day, you were banned because of the actions you chose over other options, and nothing else.","replies":[]},{"poster":"enshine","date":"2019-08-16T03:28:53.929+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Alyss Akashiya,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=3dlHLtfT,comment-id=0002000000010001,timestamp=2019-08-16T03:14:52.325+0000)\n\n\n\nwhy are you writing a thesis paper on every reply? nobody's gonna read that shit. learn to be concise","replies":[{"poster":"Alyss Akashiya","date":"2019-08-16T03:44:27.795+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"because its my fucking account if u have nothing to contribute to the solution don't be apart of the problem LOL\n\nlike if u couldnt use ur main account which u put money on wouldnt u want to write a small thing to get something solved and get it back????????\n\nplus it lakes less than 5m to write this :/","replies":[{"poster":"enshine","date":"2019-08-16T04:47:43.100+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Alyss Akashiya,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=3dlHLtfT,comment-id=000200000001000100000000,timestamp=2019-08-16T03:44:27.795+0000)\n>\n> because its my fucking account if u have nothing to contribute to the solution don't be apart of the problem LOL\n> \n> like if u couldnt use ur main account which u put money on wouldnt u want to write a small thing to get something solved and get it back????????\n> \n> plus it lakes less than 5m to write this :/\n\ni'm not reading that either","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Håppy","date":"2019-08-16T02:27:36.642+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=KFCeytron,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=3dlHLtfT,comment-id=000200000001,timestamp=2019-08-16T01:33:24.086+0000)\n> It sounds like you're actually not familiar with how the punishment system works. **It doesn't take \"context\" into account because no context could excuse your behavior.** I explained this above.

This ain't it, chief. If this is how it actually works, then that explains why so many people have a problem with how Riot Games handles their players.

Both behaviors you describe are inappropriate and can result in a punishment if enough of that type of behavior is displayed.\n\nIf you misbehave but a teammate or opponent does or says something even worse, you should definitely report them after the match, just as someone reported OP for their own misbehavior. Yes, that's certainly possible. Reports are not a limited resource. Any time someone believes that another player violated LoL's behavioral standards, they can report that player. Punishments are similarly not limited: if more than one player in a game merits a punishment, they can both get a punishment. This can happen even if the players in question were antagonizing each other. The IFS doesn't need to weigh the severity of all reported players' actions and then \"award\" the \"winner\" with a punishment; it's not a contest.\n\nThink of it like dealing with a noisy person in a library: ask them to keep it down, and then notify library staff and move to another area if that doesn't work. If you get into a shouting match with them, you're just as likely to be removed, even if you weren't shouting _quite_ as loudly as they were. The goal is a quiet library.\n\nMuting blocks the chat harassment. Muting is 100% effective at not having to read it. No amount of flaming back is going to convince them to stop standing still and typing and start playing the game, so you might as well mind your own manners rather than giving the troll any attention, which would ruin the game experience further.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Alyss Akashiya","date":"2019-08-16T01:03:53.994+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"i made several attempts to stop them from continue this targeting of me including asking some of my friends that were in call with my at the time to attempt to calm this player down for their random upset nature and lashing out at me for trying to enjoy myself in a normal game and this player refused and ignored all other players","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Håppy","date":"2019-08-16T02:31:31.705+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"I think what people aren't seeing here is that Alyss was not being toxic.
