Is he just so manly that people&#039;s brains shut down as soon as Darius comes onto their screen? Are they so terrified to give that 15% missing health heal that they&#039;d rather die? I have no idea, but people weren&#039;t this stupid about him before the rework. People actually tried to kite and poke back then.","replies":[{"poster":"Dealth","date":"2015-09-06T02:01:35.128+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, it's just that escaping darius is impossible.

Now why could that be? ","replies":[]}]}
