She can slow you right back and hop away. Irelia doesn't have enough CC or gap closers, same with J4 and Maokai. Nasus can't get close enough during wither due to its ramp up time. Trynd can't even slow her since she's facing him while moving away. \r\n\r\nIs there something I'm missing, or should I just always counterpick with Ryze or Vlad?","replies":[{"poster":"Thefriendlyorc","date":"2015-02-27T00:35:35.609+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:254}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Edgar Van Ekart","date":"2015-02-27T00:29:59.375+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Man, this champion was horribly desgined, in the way that she autowins vs any melee champion except for maybe Zed, who the hell thought it would be a good ideia to give a ranged champion a free flash after every autoattack...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gunpoint","date":"2015-02-27T15:15:00.329+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:127}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Orangesilk","date":"2015-02-27T12:46:53.571+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I do {{champion:131}}, but yeah, Kalista is really bad design, Riot has been saying forever \"We don't believe in hard counters\" But Kalista IS the literal definition of a champion you HAVE to hardcounter with a point and click ability or she's literally impossible to deal with.\n\nAs for your question, champions with strong point and click burst and double dashing {{champion:114}} {{champion:131}} can deal with her somewhat favorably (most Kalistas disappear on a full combo of either of these two).
