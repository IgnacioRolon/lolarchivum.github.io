Anyone with a brain should have looked at those nerfs on paper and realized they were too extreme and would have rendered him obsolete, or at least that they would destroy any possibility for him to be a \"hypercarry\" as you now describe him. His win rate was terrible so you buffed him back in the fall, but then that was apparently too good (even though he barely had a 50% win rate as a result) so you nerfed him to smithereens in the name of \"balance,\" in a game where Ahri and Katarina (far less technically demanding champions) have sat comfortably at a 55% win rate for ages. And your whole argument for doing so - that Azir shouldn't be a lane bully and instead should be a late game hyper carry - is truly underwhelming, especially considering the huge nerf to his late game damage output. What about Cassiopeia, Jinx, and Vayne? Are you going to tell me that they're not abusive lane opponents either? I tried playing Azir against a Cassio yesterday (whom Azir is supposed to counter), and literally could make no counterplay to her because I could no longer out range, out maneuver, or out damage her at any stage of the game - but that's ok, because *Insert obscure questionably logical reason here*\n\nForgive me, but it's very frustrating to have paid for this guy at release and to then lose over and over again because of an overboard, barely thought out or tested nerf and bugs that you guys still haven't been able to fix for months. I am glad you'll be buffing him soon, but the entire history of Azir has caused me to sincerely question Riot's competence and ability to do anything right.","replies":[{"poster":"Silents429","date":"2015-02-24T23:00:43.490+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":5,"body":"Oh wow someone complaining about nerfs. \n\nTo a Riot member saying he was going to get buffed. \n\nJesus.","replies":[{"poster":"GorillazNtheMyst","date":"2015-02-25T04:22:52.789+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yes, because it goes beyond the nerf. The fact is the champion has NEVER worked consistently on top of it. The two things Azir relies upon entirely for survival and relevance - his W and his ult - never work. In this patch, once again, his soldiers work unbelievably poorly, and his ult - a bloody wall - is just going through people again. I just feel that they maybe should have made sure he could actually function completely before they castrated him. It's unprofessional and irresponsible.

There have been several new champion releases since Azir, some of them fairly complicated, but I bet that Kalista's ult never randomly fails to knockup, or that Gnars ult ever fails to stun. That's what it's like to play Azir - you are totally dependent on two skills that are incredibly unreliable. \n\nAnd yes, I am raising this issue to a Riot member because I have legitimate frustration with the entire process and don't know who else to make it known to. I believe I also told him I was glad they were buffing him back, but that I was disappointed with Azir's continuing development. Whether they've done the right thing or not over the past few months, it at least to me doesn't seem like the team really knows what to do with Azir and all his problems, and I happen to feel that their solution to this - to basically tell us in the 5.3 patch notes, \"he's broken still and we can't fix him, but we're going to shrek everything about him and give you AD stats that don't even help you as compensation,\" is not really a great choice befitting a company that is clearly trying to market its game these days as more fresh and  accessible to all. \n\nIt doesn't matter if I'm a programmer or not, I'm still a consumer, and with that relationship comes a certain unwritten quality agreement that in this case frankly has not been met. I purchased a product that literally has never worked 100% since day one, only to watch him get neutered sort of recklessly. As a rational person I just disagree with the way that Riot went about the nerfs, opting to go ham instead of gradually adding nerfs over time so that their effects could be better experimented with. Instead, we got what was practically a rework (he plays entirely differently now) and watched his winrate plummet 10% for a week and counting.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Tengrichan","date":"2015-02-24T12:44:02.964+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Oh boy.can't wait.\nIf you do that than improve the soldiers' auto attack animation so they carry out the attack faster like you did with Katarina's auto attacks.\n\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"Moonshade","date":"2015-02-24T20:08:35.859+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=eZvxEKrF,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2015-02-24T10:41:27.680+0000)\n>\n> Agreed, implied range should match actual range. \n> \n> We're working on some buffs to Azir at the moment, which will likely include giving him at least some range back on the W.

They enter fights with either the element of burst, or AOE because their lane is central to summoner's rift. If you look at most teams that surrender ~20 min and see the highest dmg dealt to champs; it is almost always the mid lane using their level advantage and high mid game damage to reach the top of the charts.\nAzir lacks both of those elements (early on).\n\nAll of this being said, Azir's W **attack range** is not the problem, in fact this offers counter play to what I think is a broken champion. \nNashors lets you land 2 soldier attacks once they are slowed by the Q, even after the range nerf.
