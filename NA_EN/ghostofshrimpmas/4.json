Paired with his passive, it seems like he&#039;d be a sort of aoe siege mage. \r\n\r\nHis W is a versatile auto buff that takes a bit of setup to get good use out of. This seems to suggest bursty assassin.\r\n\r\nHis E is a reward for autoing a lot, which suggests that he&#039;s a sustained damage ap auto attacker. \r\n\r\nAnd his ult is a perfect assassination tool, with a big dose of team utility. \r\n\r\nHis kit really feels all over the place, and has no coherent theme. Is he an aoe siege mage? An assassin? A Sustained dpser? And, aside from his W and passive, what do any of those abilities have to do with being a gambler?","replies":[{"poster":"Eedat","date":"2016-08-28T20:38:47.485+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Picks. TF's kit revolves around making Picks. He's kind of like an AP assassin. Charge your E proc on creeps, pop ult, grab your gold card, port in, heavily burst a squishy target with E proc + Gold card + Q + Thunderlords + Lich bane.\n\nThats how his kit works","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ok sure but why","date":"2016-08-28T20:28:18.862+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"assassin works nice\n\nhe either reks fast or gets rekt fast","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2016-08-28T20:22:44.922+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mechanically I would say that he is an aoe siege mage with a lot of map presence. He needs the CC and burst to help gank and the pushing skills to zone and siege.\n\nFrom a more lore based perspective, he is a card shark and a gambler. His passive gives a random amount of gold on kill. His W, were he not a cheater, would give him a random AA buff depending on what he pulled out of the deck of cards, but since he is a cheater he gets to pick a card. His E is basically just for it to make his cool autoattacks where he throws cards worth adding to the theme.","replies":[]}]}
