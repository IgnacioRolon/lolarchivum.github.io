How about at least changing it to partially turn back mobility creep, by having it be disabled for ~5 seconds after using another moveblock ability and having other moveblock abilities be disabled for ~5 seconds after using Flash?

I guess I just disagree with some of your conclusions. The way I see it, for something like flash + tibbers, there is going to be a risk associated with it, that risk being missing one person and giving them the chance to jump on you and potentially killing you because of squishyness.\n\nit's extremely annoying to get ganked, even when I've warded it out and I have spotted them and they sit forever in a bush nearby that's unwarded.  It takes time and effort to properly judge whether the enemy jungler has actually left the lane or not. It doesn't take effort to press nothing while waiting for the opportune moment.  The way I see it, flash punishes the jungler for doing \"nothing\". Consider this, why should I zone myself out of potential cs and exp, just because their jungler might be in that unwarded lane bush every time, which can't be warded because then I'd be in range for the catch?\n\nWhat I don't like about flash is that it is countered by... well... flash, mostly every game on every champion.

I don't know...","replies":[{"poster":"ItemsGuy","date":"2014-11-26T11:37:55.103+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Missing Flash + Tibbers isn't so much a risk/reward play as it is a \"I somehow managed to miss an instant AoE stun/nuke with a small cast time\" play. What *would* be a risk/reward play is an Annie flanking an enemy team in an attempt to blow her full combo on the enemy carry while her team initiates to buy her time and pull aggro. THAT is risk/reward because Annie is putting herself at risk, to potentially gain a reward whose value is near/equal to that risk. Messing up an instant moveblock isn't a risk, and having that instant moveblock mitigates a lot of risk (that flanking Annie can just Flash away if she screws up, or can Flash into ult range to blow her combo faster and give the enemy team less time to react). \n\nOne thing I'd suggest is having 3 wards on the map at all times. You'd tend to not have this problem nearly as much if you use more than your Trinket ward (even as a top-laner and mid-laner, this is something I haven't had much of a problem with since S3 back when I though vision was a coward's game). And even without Flash, there are many things you can do to counteract this problem--many of which require some sort of forethought, skill, or coordination, such as warding beforehand (seriously, this is the best advice I can give to any player, aside from understanding the value of cs), feinting to bait them out of whatever bush they're in, or calling on your own jungler for a countergank. All of these plays have some amount of depth to them, compared to simply *not* using Flash to all-in the enemy champion. This is a fairly good example of Flash's existence as a crutch as well, because what you are suggesting is \"Why should I have to take all these preventative measures when it's already hard enough to Flash as soon as I see that jungler poke his head out of the bush?\"\n\nAs I will say in a number of the responses to my original post, Flash is one of the greatest causes and effects of movecreep, and it puts designers in a difficult spot where mobile champions will become dominant if they remove it, and Flash will become even *more* dominant if mobility was cut down and properly accounted for in the power budgets of individual champions.\n\nThank you for replying, and please take my advice when it comes to warding! It'll save you a lot of frustration in the long run, and 75 gold is a lot less than it seems for the safety it provides.","replies":[{"poster":"Paper1","date":"2014-11-26T16:26:05.834+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think you can summarise a play in one phrase like that, because good players put more thought and decision making into that play. You need to consider what position I have to be in in the first place, where do I flash to, what precise position do i ult, whats their likely position going to be when I finish the move, will my team be vulnerable to e.g. a counter flank e.t.c. e.t.c.. There is always going to be some risk taking all of these things into account, even if the standard play risk is considered to be smaller than the flank risk.  Suppose if I was a really shit player who hit 25 percent of my skillshots, then that's something I seriously have to take into consideration when making the play. Annie may not be able to just flash away, because she has to consider which route is best to escape. Annie may not be able to just flash ult into range, because her team may not be able to follow up fast enough. Basically what I believe is, maybe flash removes a lot of the risk, but there is still enough risk there to force you to make good decisions.\n\nConcerning your warding advice, again you need to consider whats going to be happening at that precise moment AND in the future. There is such a thing as inefficient warding. One example is that if you go ward river while you see the enemy jungler on the opposite side of the map, then you have wasted time on that ward. Another one is that if you place you maximum three wards, nobody has ganked and then you have to back once they expire, you give the opportunity to your opponent to take dragon without any of your team realising it. And even if i had placed three wards in the situation i was trying to describe, you cant light up every single bush. The best you can do is know that if you need to move towards an unwarded bush for whatever reason, there is a higher chance that someone is still there if you saw them go in. In fact, you know that they are definitely going to still be there for a mere eight seconds. I am glad I have flash as a summoner spell then because it counteracts this unhealthy playstyle of camping, and furthermore there is more depth to flash because I have to weigh up what spells are going to be fired at me in what direction, how much damage and how much cc for it to be worth putting flash on cooldown. Simply flashing out of any situation that seems bad without taking into account such factors is just bad play, and this is what I find confusing about how you are describing your problem.\n\nTo me, a large chunk of you argument boils down to \"we have to change flash because too many people are just flashing to avoid any bad situation based on immediate gut reaction, and not enough people are using flash to make well thought out plays involving it\", to which I disagree with, because I think changes should be made for the purpose of balancing the game for people who actually know how to play, who actually make a living off playing this game. As much as id like to see Jayce nerfed for instance, I don't expect people to put value on my opinion because I am not necessarily a great player. I am diamond V btw. There are a lot more players who have a better idea of where Jayce is at is what I'm trying to say, just like there are players better than me and you who have a better idea of where flash stands at the moment.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Auryiel","date":"2014-11-25T17:23:13.266+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> As cool and, er, \"flashy\" as Flash-based plays *can* be, it seems that, more often or not, it exists as a crutch whose necessity is both a cause and effect of movement creep (which has long since been established as a problem).

I merely stated that immobile characters need Flash to be even remotely relevant in the current environment. If every single character with mobility is nerfed, then fine remove Flash.

However, since Flash is taken on just about anyone (*especially* immobile champs) that power discrepancy and the sheer worth of mobility/self-displacement doesn't seem quite as high, and thus Flash doesn't seem like as much of a problem as it really is, and is a necessary evil at worst to many.\n\nThe course of action that has the most in mind for the game's health would be to handle it all in one fell swoop during a preseason, but this would require more than a year's worth of work in preparation beforehand and is much, much easier said than done.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"GhostOfShrimpmas","date":"2014-11-25T04:14:25.064+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":3,"body":"Wasn't the main reason the smite changes were made in order to increase in-game options?

There, unless a Smite-laner is investing time into laning and jungling/counter then they don't get full power. This will force Smite-laners to better use their windows of opportunity.\n\nIf the stats are too efficient then **1)** nerf the enchant stats (*cut in half*) and **2)** add a second enchantment level than can only be bought if/when the champion has acquire a large number of neutral monster kills (*60/80?*). There you go, junglers still get power+good buildpath since they will easily meet the jungle mob requirements while Smite-laners won't get free, optimal stats without screwing their own jungler over or being a counter-jungling god.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Earl Eulrich","date":"2014-11-25T14:38:20.681+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Could you imagine a featured game-mode that is practically SR, but without flash? \njust to see how it plays out...I wouldn´t be surprised if I would enjoy it more than the version with flash.

Where do I Flash to? etc.\" aren't risks, they're decisions. Also, pinning this on low player skill also isn't really helping--saying that Flash is a risk if you're bad at the game, means that every other play that *doesn't* involve Flash is much, much riskier (considering the mechanical necessity of flashing within range and nicking somebody with a fairly generous AoE that also stuns them, if we're still using the Annie example). If the person in this example is as bad an Annie player as you want them to be, then attempting to flank without Flash is a much, *much* riskier play, because she loses a lot of the surprise factor (\"HEY GUYS I SUDDENLY WENT FROM THE EDGE OF YOUR SIGHT RANGE RIGHT INTO TIBBERS RANGE\") that comes from using it as initiation, and almost all of the safety that would come from using it as a get-out-of-jail free card. I understand you find Flash useful, and I have no idea what your skill level is, but please understand that having the ability to instantly and freely displace yourself removes one hundred times the risk it adds into the game. [Refer again to my quote from Zileas](http://i.imgur.com/vCTBfKt.png). \n\nIf the jungler is the only one ganking (ie. if their mid is losing horribly and is trapped in lane), then as soon as you see the enemy jungler on the opposite side of the map, start shoving and count to 30 in your head. Try to get your wave to the enemy tower to \"reset\" your push, and once that starts happening, run back and place your wards (only count to 15 if you're mid). The wave should start pushing to your tower at that point, so if you're good at freezing (keep minions slightly away from your tower range, the only damage you should be doing is last-hitting) you should have multiple layers of safety for a while. Resetting your lane is also good if you're out of wards, as you can typically recall and walk back to lane while the minions push back to your tower, and farm 'em up when you get there. Also, at least someone on your team (typically the jungler) should be warding dragon! It's pretty important. In regards to camping, it's not so much \"unhealthy\" as it is capitalizing on (generally) inexperienced players having poor map awareness or who generally make the same mistakes over and over again and don't adapt, so while it isn't necessarily fun to be on the receiving end of it, there are many ways to counteract it that actually make you better at the game from both a mechanical and strategic standpoint, rather than holding onto Flash and poofing away out of reflex once you see that Lee Sin poke his head out of the brush. Also, the things you have to weigh (\"what's coming at me from where etc.\") are things you'd have to weigh no matter what, even if you were walking towards your destination, and generally, \"Not dying and having to wait for respawn while giving the enemy gold and losing map control\" is always worth having to play a bit less recklessly for a few minutes. Just because you can Flash wrong doesn't make it some deep and complex mechanic that's good for the game (especially since it so often chokes out a wider variety of more interesting and complex plays). Again, refer to the Zileas quote.\n\nThat's not at all what I'm saying--I'm saying that the vast, *vast* majority of Flash's potential use cases (and almost the entirety of its most accessible use cases) is a response to \"oops, I fucked up\", whether that entails getting caught out, not being able to finish somebody off, staying under a tower for too long, not being able to position well for a dragon/Baron fight, and so on. Not only that, but the mere existence of Flash as a summoner spell available to anyone and everyone (past a certain summoner level, anyway) chokes out a lot of much more interesting plays (again, the Zileas quote). Also, I am not speaking to you as a player who knows nothing about the game, but as a student of game design partway through an MA. I spend a lot of time graphing this stuff out and measuring the pros and cons of every little gameplay decision that exists in the game (the whole \"majority of Flash's potential use cases\" isn't hyperbole or me pulling stuff out of a hat--I've spent weeks sitting down and charting this out), which is probably why I've been approached for a summer internship at Riot ([among other reasons](http://rfmelley.wix.com/lolredesignproject)), after which, I will finish my MA and continue working there. I am not talking to you as a Silver II player who thinks that Flash is just lame and unfair and doesn't deserve to be in the game, but as a game designer who sees the effects that Flash has on the game, that it *has* had on the game for quite some time, and its role in the existence of movecreep and the recently developing knockup creep (since most of it is AoE and position-based, and Flash is a great way to counteract that). I am not saying that Flash isn't an awesome and really, really useful spell, I am saying that it is unhealthy for the game and for the playerbase (not allowing the players to suffer through their poor positioning/forethought/etc. because a get-out-of-jail-free card exists means that they will learn from those mistakes at a much slower rate, if at all--hence how there are Diamond V players that still have the problems typically signature of a Bronze V-Silver I player), and that it is part of a much larger problem that should be acknowledged and addressed over time.\n\nThese responses are getting a bit lengthy, and while I certainly appreciate the time and effort you've put into tossing words back and forth with me, I'm a bit of a busy guy so I'll have to end this line of conversation here! For funsies though, try playing a few consecutive games without Flash every now and then, and keep track of the times where you wish you had Flash. Write 'em down somewhere, and try to think about how you would've handled it without Flash. Even when you're playing with Flash again, you'll realize that it does have a cooldown, and your gameplay when it's down will surely be improved!
