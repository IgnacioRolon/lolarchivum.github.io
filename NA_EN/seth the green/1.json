I've been playing league for around 5 years now, and not once, on any internet service or at any location, have i had a nice lag free game. All i really want to do is be able to play ranked, but due to crappy internet I do not try, i can barely play norms now because its just gotten worse (even though i'm currently on the \"best\" service I've ever played on)","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-17T01:52:32.592+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even with spectacular download speeds, you can still have some lag if something is blocking your network's connection with our servers.
