I am wondering why i got placed onto low priority queue even though I came back into the game 10 minutes before it was over. My computer died, but I got it working before it was over. But one other person afk. Is there anyway I can get out of the low priority queue? \r\nThank you.\r\n\r\nI was playing Garen btw.\r\n{{champion:86}}","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-26T20:40:05.767+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you're marked as inactive by the [Leaverbuster System,](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ) you'll receive a penalty for the match. This is because regardless if you reconnect to a match, disconnecting leaves your team without a full team of 5 and negatively impacts everyone. \n\nBecause of this, disconnections are all treated equally, and penalties cannot be removed or modified.
