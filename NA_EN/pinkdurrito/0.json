It sounds like your network might be having problems or is blocked from reaching the game server.  I suggest running through the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to troubleshoot.  The [hextech repair tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367) also has an option to auto-configure firewall settings to help.\n\nBe sure to test it in a custom game, though, to prevent anymore penalties.  Let me know if you have any questions!","replies":[]}]}
