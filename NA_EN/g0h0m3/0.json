Do you ever make it to the login screen?  Are you able to still login through the legacy client:\n\n-  On the login screen of the open beta updated client, look for the \"Launch Legacy Client\" text at the bottom.\n-  Or create a shortcut directly to the legacy client in your League Installation. Just look for \"lol.launcher\"\n\nThis will help rule out possibilities, as I'm unsure if this might be an issue with the client, network, or something else entirely.  Let me know!","replies":[{"poster":"G0H0m3","date":"2016-11-19T00:12:45.550+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately I couldn't get to the login screen, and if I launch lol.launcher it doesn't show anything when I press the launch button, but when I star client again new or old it doesn't matter, it shows me the same withe screen with that message.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-19T00:26:26.800+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the follow-up.
