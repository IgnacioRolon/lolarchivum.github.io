It also suits the Radiant wukong so well as if he been re-incarnated. \r\n\r\nI know this is just my personal opinion but I hope my voice counts \r\n\r\nThanks","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2018-03-29T19:13:22.840+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, thanks for the report! \n\nUnfortunately, this is a bug, and something that will be fixed next patch. For context, the death VFX that turn him to stone weren't set to turn off once he revived, resulting in the overlay persisting. ;-;","replies":[]}]}
