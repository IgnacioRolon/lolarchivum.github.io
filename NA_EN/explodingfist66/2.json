A fair example is outside of crit changes, many adcs like Jinx/Sivir don't have great keystone options outside of Fleet Footwork, which got gutted--so you end up using the gutted Fleet or use Lethal Tempo which is \"meh\". \n\nThe other point is that some champions utilize a particular keystone well but it alters their play patterns. As an example, back when Lulu mid was still more of a thing, the best keystone option for her was thunderlords--however, in order to proc it, you'd need to E + AA + Q the enemy champ, which took away a big part of the decision making in her E--do you use it to shield yourself, or burst more? The option became clear--you use it for damage, because you needed to in order to quickly proc tlord. \n\nI get that back in the day, old masteries were somewhat boring (%increase damage, flat damage, flat hp, flat armor), but they gave you options for adjustment based on what you needed out of that game (flat stats vs scaling, utility vs. damage, defensive stats vs. utility/damage) and didn't heavily impact the way you actually have to play your champion.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kazekiba","date":"2018-08-03T03:49:11.157+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am happy with Transcendence, although game states make it come on too late and there are notable champions who need that 10% CDR at very low levels. Maybe it can give 1% Cdr/level up to 10, or 5% CDR at level 6 and then 10% at level 10. Lower ratios to compensate if you need, since buying something like Luden's Echo while already at the CDR cap, or hitting 40% CDR and then picking up Blue buff, is a MASSIVE gain in AP to say nothing of Transendence's dominance in URF ...

(I myself was a bit of a completionist myself) and had 500,000 ip worth of runes and still had 100k ip when the runes were changed. \n\nHowever, there was a ton of value in the old system that could be transfered to the new system. At least in part. \n\nSome examples here. Part of the reason that damage feels so high right now is that the early game armor and magic resist was not properly compesated when we recieved the new system. (in addition to keystones being like an extra spell or passive in a champions kit) \n\nUtility options are not properly represented. As a riven player I am still very annoyed that we were aluded to a replacement for 10% cdr at level 1 and what we got was transcendence. (riven was very heavily balanced around her early game having that cooldown reduction) \n\nCookie cutter ad as ap and HP per level is not the same as the variety we had before from the runes. (bonuses you get from primary paths.) \n\nMultiple suggestions have been made however my favorite was along the lines of removing those AD AP AS HP bonuses from the actual rune system (which is basically masteries) \n\nAnd granting you 3 slots separate from them in which each of those slots would give 1 of the following. \n\nAD\nAP \nAS\nHP \nHP Regen\nMS\nCDR\n\n\nBecause like it or not, the new system removed far more variety then it actually added.\n\n\nAlso, for progression.  Achievements would be nice. Higher mastery levels. Free basic unique skins on high mastery levels. (or unlockable with a fair bit of BE, something like a golden recolor, super cheap to make but very exclusive so it feels good to have) special Flair's for high levels. Like 250/500/750/1000 unlocking special emotes and border banners saying you have played alot. And so on. All of these would feel very good to people who play the game a ton and want to feel as though they are progressing. \n\nAlso champion specific emotes at the 1 million mastery point mark.
