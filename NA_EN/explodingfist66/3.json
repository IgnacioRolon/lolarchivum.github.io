They aren't putting effort nor quality into skins recently.The only decent skins so far are Demon Tristana and the IG skins. This is evident towards Mordekaiser's reworked skins which we had to beg Riot to add more effects into. Anyway here were the new skins:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDaYOrF4EGE\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXQ2aSTQmnY\n\nBattle Boss Yasuo is more of a disappointment than that Basketball Ivern skin. I'm completely fine with Kai'sa and Caitlyn getting a skin. So many cool concepts could go with Battle Boss and you chose fucking Yasuo out of all of them. Literally any void monster could fit as a battle boss: {{champion:161}} {{champion:31}} {{champion:96}} {{champion:421}} or better yet we haven't seen a {{champion:56}} skin in forever. I totally understand though, Riot is a small indie game company after all.","replies":[{"poster":"TyrekGoldenspear","date":"2019-06-11T19:14:08.241+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"> They aren't putting effort nor quality into skins recently.\n\nYou have a citation for this, or do you count any skin that doens't appeal to you lacking effort and quality.","replies":[{"poster":"Elipo","date":"2019-06-11T19:47:08.502+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well arcade cait looks like an arcade mf's chroma.

It's for the theme.","replies":[{"poster":"Elipo","date":"2019-06-11T20:27:55.973+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you color blind? They dont share the colour palette, only the tackyness in the colours chosen. \n\nI wasnt talking about colours but their clothes (wich is really obvious at least for non colour blinds). For example Sona MF and riven had different clothes in their arcade skins, they shared some acsesories but that was all. Cait looks like raided arcade mf's closet and dyed her clothes then put them on and then some of those were found by kaisa and did the same.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Elipo","date":"2019-06-11T19:42:53.390+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"They are so ugly.

There needs to be a certain \"boss feeling\" or \"mini game feeling\" since most of the boss skins relates to old acade type boss battles.  I would ague for {{champion:82}}  to fit this theme better or {{champion:41}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cherry Tsundere","date":"2019-06-12T01:50:35.894+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"help me my page is randomly translated to german but I'm american","replies":[]},{"poster":"CherryBlossomTea","date":"2019-06-11T20:29:31.318+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i disagree. Although he arcade skins sure arent my favorite from the game, I dont think theyre half bad. And their other skins theyve released recently are amazing!!! As a jhin main, im super stoked to have dark cosmic jhin coming out next week and i think its aWeSoMe. Also galaxy slayer zed is beautiful. Cut them some slack, so many people want a lot of things from them. And, in the end, its a free game and ya'll chose to play so can you really complain?","replies":[]}]}
