You're right. Why *should* you pick her, when supports like Braum, Thresh, or Nami exist? I mean, she's clearly outclassed by them, so why bother?\r\n\r\nWell, maybe now you'll understand how immobile top laners have felt for an entire goddamn season. To sit back, helpless, and watch as each new release slowly pushes your favorite champion(s) farther and farther out of viability. To be promised that top laners would \"feel the love\" this season, only to watch three of them get slight buffs, and the rest get shoved under the rug.\r\n\r\nIt's almost the same thing really, except Riot gave you the luxury of trying to rework Sona into something that works, granted, she's still struggling to keep up, the fact is that Riot *tried* for you. They didn't give us anything, and instead thought that releasing overloaded garbage like Gnar would fix things, when really, all they did was cause more problems.\r\n\r\nOur problems are one and the same, our favorite champions are slowly losing their place in the game.","replies":[{"poster":"AMYS GRAVE","date":"2015-01-06T03:59:02.648+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"assassins dominating the meta, \\#betternerfsona\ntanks useless, \\#betternerfsona\nlee sin op, \\#betternerfsona\nwe expanded the supporting cast to include more mages than ever, \\#betternerfsona","replies":[{"poster":"AFK at Keyboard","date":"2015-01-06T08:01:18.332+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Nope\n\n{{champion:39}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"soliznoel","date":"2015-01-06T02:52:28.714+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"i never liked sona that much because she was annoying to lane against, but in no way is a chzmp being annoying a reason to nerf them lol.

She is my most played champion. \n\nI can tell you that she is an inferior Nami. I can confirm this with this magical thing called math. We can go into that if you want.\n\nI can also tell you that her Heal is mediocre compared to the mana cost, and her Poke, which is the only thing she has going for her, is being nerfed. Her poke is better than Nami's, at the cost of having to get within 500 range of a target to actually do any damage to them. If you get caught, you are dead. End of story. Want to beat a Sona lane? Kill her. That simple. Very easy to do. If Sona is playing Passive, you have already won.\n\nNow, dont get me wrong, A good Sona can poke very hard and will stay safe doing so. She will go in when she knows she cannot get jumped on. This is exactly what Riot is taking away from her. She is getting nothing in return.\n\nAfter this patch. Pre-6, she wont be able to do anything anymore but spam heals and go oom. \n\nHer poke and movement speed are being nerfed. Her ult, and damage reduction on empowered W, is all she is going to have. Nami's ult does more if the enemy picks up tenacity, and overall Nami just does what Sona does better. My only reason for taking Sonais going to be purely for her W's mini exhaust, , that is her only advantage. It will help against bursty adc's/supps.\n\nI will not be suprised if it gets nerfed too. Its actually kinda strong. Too bad that by the time she gets in range to use it, she will be dead.\n\nShe needs to be tuned back into an Aura Utility Supp. If they dont want her to be a poke supp, then actually give her aura's. Her aura's are garbage, and guess who, Nami has all of them, and can use them more efficiently. \n\nBut just blindly nerfing her to the point where she is literally a worse Nami is just bad.","replies":[{"poster":"AetherKingdom","date":"2015-01-06T06:05:59.460+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":7,"body":"Well, I can tell you that Sona is good in her own way. \nHer Poke is better, her auto attack enhance can be applied by 5 people, she can shield 5 people and heal 2, she can provide a large burst of movement speed (please don't compare nami ms boost to sona's, sona's is incomparably better.), and can CC.\nShe also has the choice of doing more damage, reducing an enemies damage (basically exhausting two people), or slowing an enemies movement speed).\nShe has things that give her an edge over other supports, and if you can't effectively utilize all of these things then I suggest you relearn how to play Sona.","replies":[{"poster":"Pika310","date":"2015-01-06T07:08:52.320+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"The Galileo Complex has reared its head once again.
