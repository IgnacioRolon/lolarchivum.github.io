Besides, with the little bit of lore that we have between dragons and Runeterra, there is some hunting of them, which is how Prince Jarvan IV came across Shyvanna. So theoretically speaking there could be appropriate lore for Swain capturing and training dragons as a manner of gaining power. Sounds like a pretty Noxus thing to do.","replies":[{"poster":"Nox Aeternam","date":"2014-03-04T04:14:09.379+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had another comment on my first post about Lulu, dunno if you saw it.
