Please, I'm begging, don't ignore us :(","subforum":"Story, Art, & Sound","up_votes":95,"down_votes":23,"body":"Guess what?  It's another Ahri splash thread!  Yay!  As if we didn't have enough eh? \n\nSo it looks like the updated 5.1 patch splash is here to stay.  Many people have voiced their disaproval, and ok Riot, I get it, you're not gonna change something every time you see a complaint.  People have different tastes, sure.  And if you were to react to every single little complain on the forums, you'd never be able to satisfy everyone.  \n\nBUT I do feel there are some things that you'd have to be blind or insanely stubborn not to realize.  Like wukong's coloring the first time the new splash came out.  It was orange, OBVIOUSLY way off from the red that is wukong.   And indeed it was later fixed.  You know what else is also OBVIOUSLY way off?  Ahri's chin. \n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/QuaVMQu.png\n\n It's . . .sorry, but . . . it's ugly.  No other way to put it.  I think it's a huge part of the reason people complain that they don't find the new Ahri attractive.  It's passable when you look at the splash art as a whole, but when you focus in on the face, such as when you look at the character icon, you see this HUGE shadow/tumor underneath her lips.  Look at her character model, her skin models, her skin splashes.  NONE of them have that weird tumor chin.\n\nThis is what I'm proposing, very very simple fix.  \n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/pb5Thdh.jpg\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/W5QXf7z.png\n\nvery subtle, just a simple reduce the size/prominence of that chin.  A lot of Asians have round/soft faces, and sure some have a pointed prominent chin, but it's not tumor looking.  You guys probably got fed up with all the complaints, thinking you'd never be able to please the fan base after you kept getting criticism even after already reworking her, but don't let that blind you from the fact that that chin is fugly.  Again, very simple fix - just soften the features.\n\n\ntl:dr please Riot, fix Ahri's chin, it looks bad right now {{summoner:3}}  and it's a very very simple fix that I think would make everyone happy {{summoner:31}}  without upsetting really anyone .  Please don't ignore this thread like you do so many other amazing (and often highly upvoted) suggestions.\n\n***edit*  I'm not an Ahri main/fan btw.  I'm a fan of good splash art.  And it looks like the big chin people are taking this too personally, point is the chin doesn't match her in game model-her skin models-her skin splashes-her concept art-her new dawn video model-her fanart.  Many things don't match but this actually affects the icon which you use in the boards/minimap/champion select etc.  It sticks out too much, the lighting/shading is too harsh.**","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Sweet","date":"2015-01-16T18:31:19.316+0000","up_votes":54,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey friends, I sent this over to the splash team as feedback.
