We would remake the game 10-15 minutes in by leaving and starting a new game. After a few matches three of us hopped into flex queue. One of my friends disconnected so we decided to /remake. Sat around the fountain for 3 mins and after the remake I was put in low priority queue by LeaverBuster. Before the remake I did get an afk warning in the game but this was also the first game I've left or afk'd in. I think the custom games might have had some affect. I'm also not currently using the LCU. This happened on the old client whereas my friends were all on the new one. \r\n\r\nI'm not asking to be taken out of the low priority queue or anything, I'll probably be out of it by the time anyone reads this post. I just thought I'd try letting Riot know there may be a bug with the system. That or the time I disconnected a week or two ago contributed to what the client sees as frequently afking/leaving.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-29T04:43:34.019+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's literally impossible to obtain a Leaverbuster penalty from disconnecting from a single match, so I'm inclined that you had another leave fairly recently. Checking out your account, it does confirm that another leave or disconnection occurred within the last 30 days. \n\nI'd also wanted to mention that even if someone disconnects or never connects to a match, you should continue to play the game normally. The [/Remake system](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/208754686--Remake-FAQ) will flag *anyone* who is **inactive** during the first 3 minutes of the game, so sitting in fountain waiting for a remake may end up causing you to be flagged.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions.","replies":[]}]}
