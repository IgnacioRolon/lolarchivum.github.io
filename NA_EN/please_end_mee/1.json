I think her look is pretty iconic.  I started playing her season one when her splash art was derpy.  This was before she became highly sexualized.  I really don't consider her to be one of those \"slutty\" champions like some of the other overly sexualized champs.  You know miss fortune.  I just worry they're going to take it too far and ruin her personality.  I always viewed her as being a strong, highly independent, and determined person.  \n\nI'm just thinking about what they did to gangplank.  They completely changed his personality basically.  As stupid as it sounds that would bother me.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SugeMinPikk","date":"2018-08-07T21:30:28.242+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How do champions in a video game have any kind of \"place in [anyone's] heart\" \n\nI mained Rengar for 3 seasons before I finally quit him after 7.3.
