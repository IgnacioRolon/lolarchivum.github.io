Usually my first stream of the day, I do a quick bot game to make sure that there are no problems and the lagg and ping spikes are at a minimum. But on this occasion, after this game, I leveled up and I also got an honor capsule when I logged in. So I had an honor capsule and a level up capsule to open.\r\n\r\nTo my horror and embarrassment, when I opened the honor capsule, i got two CHAMP SHARDS for 450BE champs that I both already owned. Okay, maybe that&#039;s just bad luck, no skin, just 2 of the cheapest BE champ shards possible, for 90BE... Let&#039;s open the LEVEL UP capsule that I worked for 4 days and 15 games to get... \r\n\r\nMore cheap champ shards that I already own. So my leveling up was for nothing, save ~200BE. And my honorable and sportsmanlike gameplay was for ~180BE?!?\r\n\r\nI USED TO GET THAT FROM ONE GAME IN THE OLD SYSTEM!!!\r\n\r\nRiot you suck. I think that&#039;s enough streaming for today. Chat laughed and roasted me for 10 mins after the stream was blanked... How is it possible to open the already difficult to get Honor Capsule and the time consuming Level up capsule.. and get 5 cheap 90BE shards? Not even a skin shard from the honor capsule?","replies":[{"poster":"Mokuto Bunshi","date":"2017-12-17T22:15:08.666+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow. this randomness is really getting old :P","replies":[]}]}
