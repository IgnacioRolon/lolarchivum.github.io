Anyone know the cause of this?\n\nThank you for reporting the issue. We're actively trying to get to the bottom of this bug but have not been able to reproduce it or get logs. It would be a huge help if you could send us your logs!\n\nSteps \n1. Download the Hextech Tool: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367-Automated-Troubleshooting-Hextech-Repair-Tool\n2. Install the tool.\n3. When you see the play button grey out in the client, proceed to step 4.\n4. Run the Hextech Tool and uncheck \"Add firewall Exceptions (Enables firewall).\n5. Press \"Start\".\n6. Wait for the tool to finish collecting your logs. The tool will notify you that is has finished with a pop up saying \"All Done\". \n7. Go to your desktop and locate \"LoL Logs\"\n8. Send the \"LoL Logs.zip\" file to patcherlogs@riotgames.com\n\nThanks again for your help!","replies":[{"poster":"DaBaiXiong","date":"2017-05-20T01:57:20.747+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe don't roll out a garbage client before it was ready? \n\nMaybe instead of being drunk on bells and whistles you just use a stable client. That'd be dope. \n\nNo play button here either.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Chronofire","date":"2017-04-27T02:36:18.394+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm getting this too, even after I reset the client.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Theo0","date":"2019-06-05T06:26:37.244+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yo , i had the same problem , it worked after i run the \"repair client\" thing not once but twice.{{sticker:zombie-brand-mindblown}}","replies":[]}]}
