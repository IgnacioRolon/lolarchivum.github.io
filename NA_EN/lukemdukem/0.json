Is this something you're experiencing as Kindred, on the team team as Kindred or when there is a Kindred on the enemy team? \n\nIf it's on the enemy team, I have a feeling it may be similar to what we experienced with Dark Star Thresh in terms of a FoW issue (although not exactly the same 'cause there was some weird stuff going on script side).","replies":[{"poster":"Luqza","date":"2016-06-20T21:00:58.283+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had this problem to with super galaxy kindred when the enemy appeared on screen game froze for about 3 seconds.

Challenger Nidalee was a particle pre-load with the spear coming out of FoW; this was resolved shortly after the skin was launched. Looks like this may be similar in the case of SG Kindred.
