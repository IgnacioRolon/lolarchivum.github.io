I won one and lost one, so I should still have a third chance to reach Plat IV but for some reason, immediately after losing in the 2nd game, I was told that I was unsuccessful in my promotion. Can someone fix this please, I wont play another Solo/Duo until I receive some feedback.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-07T04:53:51.056+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did you happen to dodge at *any point* during your promos?

I didn't mind waiting 5 minutes so I just scrolled on my phone thinking it was a small bug. I didn't realize it results in a loss in promotion games since it never happened to me before.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-07T22:05:34.060+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That would be the \"dodge\" that caused your promo series to end, then. \n\nIf you experience that sort of issue again, please let me know so we can work together to troubleshoot the cause.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
