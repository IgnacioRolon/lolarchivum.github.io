He doesn't use it all that much anymore, but that's not because it's bad. In his own words he just \"got bored with it\". \n\nAfraid not my friend. Tryndamere gets a lot of AD from his Q passive alone. By contrast, he doesn't have any attack speed steroids like Jax or Master Yi. This is why rushing a big AD item like Bloodthirster is stupid. You're spending 3,700 gold on a bunch of AD (without any attack speed to make good use of it, and without having enough bonus AD scaling for that to not matter), a shield (on a champion whose ult lets them not die and is already almost unbeatable 1v1), and a lot of lifesteal, which you won't proc as often because, once again, shit-tier attack speed (and is honestly made redundant by your Q heal). By contrast, for 1,100 less gold you get more crit (up to 65% if your passive is at max), a good amount of attack speed, movement speed for chasing, waveclear, and burst damage on your first auto attack.\n\nBloodthirster is an incredibly inefficient rush on Tryndamere. You aren't making good use of the stats.  Shiv is a big power spike at a much lower cost. For the price of bloodthirster, you can get shiv and a caulfield's warhammer, or shiv, ionian's, and a dagger. This will give you much higher DPS than Bloodthirster alone would. \n\nAlso, your hatred of botrk is silly. Tryndamere was one of the only good users of it, and now that it was buffed it's better on him. Tryndamere is, at his core, a duelist. He duels people. Blade of the Ruined King is the best lifesteal item for dueling people. The lifesteal is nice (especially since you have attack speed with it), it gives some AD, a good amount of attack speed (once again attack speed is important because you have no attack speed steroids in your kit), on-hit damage, and the active is extremely important for chasing people down. This build is really all about making Tryndamere very hard to escape.\n\nGoing over the crit cap isn't particularly important, especially when Tryndamere doesn't get crit chance all the time with his passive like Yasuo does. Having higher crit gives you more consistent DPS throughout the entire fight, and being able to reach 100% at all (as opposed to your shitty build which never would).\n\nDefense item? Only bad Tryndamere players need to get a dedicated defense item in every game.","replies":[{"poster":"xBaron Nashorx","date":"2016-11-28T02:31:57.089+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"That's a huge post for one silly, obvious lie.\n\n-No, someone in challenger did not 'create' it.

The word \"create\" did not appear in my post a single time. \n\nSecond of all, \"create\" and \"pioneered\" are not necessarily synonymous.\n\n2a :  a person or group that originates or helps open up a new line of thought or activity or a new method or technical development\n\nWhich BoxerPete did. Whether or not he was the first to use his CDR build doesn't matter, he was the one who gave it the most exposure and made it more popular. \n\n> -Secondly, no, bork is still bad. Especially when you already have 2 AS or crit items, the extra AS is garbage compared to a BT.\n\nThe omission of berserker's greaves makes it far more necessary, especially when being able to auto attack more often directly correlates with higher sticking potential. The active also helps with this, which you cowardly refused to address.\n\nYou have provided no argument, you're just whining and saying what I said is wrong with no substance. \n\n> -Finally, no, BoxerPete isn&#x27;t good &quot;Just because he&#x27;s Challenger&quot;.\n\nHe is considerably better than you my terrible friend. \n\n> Ranking means nothing in this game,\n\nIt means that players in a higher rank are generally better, but this is what all the nobodies who can't get to a high rank like to girlishly cry out and claim.\n\nThis is also a very ironic point of view for someone who tried to dismiss the build as \"bronze elo\". So rank matters when you use it to dismiss someone else's argument, but not when I use it to counter said dismissal? Lol what a hypocrite. You're so desperately trying to find a way to make yourself look better than you did that you're changing your point of view as you go along. How sad.\n\n> there is a metric asstonne of guys better,\n\nName them. =)\n\n> who never get to challenger because Riot shoves toxic players all in together and prevents them from getting out of bronze or silver.\n\nThat must be why Silencee, an insanely toxic player and a Master Yi one trick pony, casually gets himself out of bronze or silver on several cheaply bought accounts.\n\n> I&#x27;m not even joking here,\n\nI know you're not joking, that you're serious makes it all the more hilarious.\n\n> pro players have attempted suicide because they are sick of how obviously rigged this game is.\n\nName these girly crybabies.\n\nBut if you want to use pro players, IWDominate, Dyrus, Imaqtpie, Scarra, and quite a few others do in fact think that rank tends to correlate with player skill. Dom in particular hates playing with anyone lower than Diamond 1.\n\n> You&#x27;re a fuckwit who literally knows nothing about the game you play.\n\nYour insults are both childishly lazy and totally devoid of substance. Compared to myself, a much smarter man who has casually demolished every cute point you've tried to make while far more eloquently making it known how far beneath me you are in an intellectual sense. \n\n> S1 i was Gold, top 15% which is todays&#x27; Diamond and have only dropped in elo since.\n\nPeople got better at the game. You're not smart enough to improve, so you couldn't keep up. =)\n\n> edit; Forgot to mention, I dropped ELO since S1 yet in Natural Selection (another team orientated strategic game) i dominated the entire asia/oceana region. It wasn&#x27;t a fluke, hitting top 15% in league. Riot just got better at rigging it ala disconnections, can&#x27;t connect to game, throwing you in with trolls 20+ matches in a row etc.\n\nI'm going to be frank here my friend.\n\nYou're a nobody. You're not important. No one cares who you are. Even if you were some dime a dozen low diamond player right now you'd still be a nobody. As hilarious as your attempt at posturing by bringing up your season one rank or your rank in some indie game is, it's incredibly misplaced and sad.\n\nWe're not talking about Natural Selection.\n\nWe're talking about League of Legends.","replies":[{"poster":"xBaron Nashorx","date":"2016-11-28T03:24:43.083+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"^ Literally the dumbest retort ever, clearly made by a pseudo-intellectual poser.\n\nI love the finale \"People got better at the game.

I've got over five thousand games on Tryndamere across all seasons.\n\nI never asked for Tryndamere to be relegated to split pushing in season 2, but thats what happened. In season 1 before he was reworked to use fury he was actually really good in team fights. Ever since they removed his bonus crit damage, nerfed his ult duration, max healing, and his spin range, he's been forced to split push.\n\nAt this point there is so much CC and mobility in the game, even if RIOT were to revert Tryndamere largely to his old kit, it wouldn't make him any better in a team fight.\n\nThe problem with Tryndamere is that he tries to do too many things. He wants to be immune to death, pump out ridiculous damage and be super sticky all at the same time. Its too much.\n\n\"Guy with a person-sized sword\" doesn't scream \"mobility / stickiness\". If it were up to me I'd take away Tryndamere's stickiness (mocking shout and nerf spin cooldown), and replace it with something that would allow him to exist in team fights.\n\nTrynd doesn't need stickiness to play the game, because if he had that (and enough of everything else), he would just be broken. If he has that and doesn't have enough of everything else to team fight, he will just split push all day and thats just boring. What he needs is some ways to de-aggro. Undying rage is a fantastic de-aggro tool, but it isn't wise to force Trynd to have all his eggs in that one basket because it makes him too binary. It makes it impossible for him to fail without dying, or to win without stomping.\n\nSo he needs something like a sword block. Something that makes the enemy backline / frontline think twice about putting focus fire on Trynd, similar to how windwall functions for yasuo.\n\nI'm thinking maybe like a channeled block that makes Trynd immune to any cc and damage originating from 180 degrees in front of him, but prevents him from moving, turning, attacking, or using spells or items while it is channeling.\n\nI'm not saying thats the only way to fix his problems, but its in the right direction. He needs less stickiness and more functionality. He shouldn't be afraid of a big fight, and in order to realize that in his gameplay you have to make him EFFECTIVE in a big fight, otherwise he will never be there-- a smart Trynd player would just avoid confrontation at all costs and split push all day.\n\nHere is thread I made on the overall ideas I have for Trynd if you are interested: http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/Vr4sFriN-make-tryndamere-more-like-a-barbarian-warrior-with-a-huge-sword-and-less-of-a-saboteur-or-bandit","replies":[{"poster":"VexingRaven","date":"2016-11-27T06:18:12.387+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Critkeeper,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=EEEm99nt,comment-id=002c,timestamp=2016-11-26T17:28:34.255+0000)\n> So he needs something like a sword block.
