Learning comes from every level of experience. You can learn some potent advice from the simple, candid minds of children, just like you can learn nuanced information based on years of experience from your grandmother. Not being willing to listen to those who may not have the same level of experience as you denies you of potentially learning something new that a fresh mind has a different take on. Granted, some of the information from the inexperienced may be redundant because you've already learned it, and some information may not be the best. The key here is to communicate with those people about that information, and you'll both end up learning things and being better players. If you shut down learning completely, you will stagnate and never get any better.","replies":[{"poster":"Veridìan","date":"2016-08-02T22:12:43.773+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":2,"body":"had to log in to upvote this masterpeice","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"AwesomeChad","date":"2016-08-02T18:16:50.586+0000","up_votes":39,"down_votes":2,"body":"I'm going to be honest with you guys.

I was a baseball player, and the dude/chick  who used that example clearly wasn't. And to the extent LoL wants to truly develop a sports platform, this kind of thinking needs to actually learn from things like baseball what baseball has known for years and years: the ability to perform a skill =/= understanding of a skill. **The ability to play the game =/= the ability to break down the game, understand the game, or conceptually strategize in the game. Mechanics =/= understanding**, and performance is predominately mechanics + basic knowledge while coaching is predominately high level knowledge and understanding. \n\nFor a low ranker to try and coach a challenger player on mechanics is stupid. But to claim that a low rank player cannot understand the game at a high level, or even at a higher level than a challenger player, is just plain false. \n\nSome of the best coaches I have ever had in baseball were nowhere near as good as I was at actually playing the game. For me to have ignored what they say - much less tried to pull 'performance rank' - would have gotten me laughed off the field by literally every single baseball player worth anything. Players who don't understand this are bad players. On the other hand, I have seen some awful coaches who didn't know anything about the game but insisted they did, and players can recognize (and ignore) this when they encounter it.
