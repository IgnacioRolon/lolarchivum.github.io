From hop 11 Europe server  till internal we can see +100ms spikes. It's not us players who are actually lagging but it's peering issue.

Based on what I see here, the initial info might be really important in case your own router could be having issues.  I only suggest this because your ping is pretty high from the start.  Unless your ping is pretty low at the start, then disregard of course.\n\nI also recommend running a traceroute from [WinMTR](http://winmtr.net/winmtr-v0-92-now-available/) instead for a few minutes, it makes what's happening much easier to read.  \n\nWe can do our best to offer assistance as well, but we may be unable to do a lot if the ISP is not part of the list of [Peering Partners.](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/210665503-NA-Peering-Partners)\n\nThe information is much appreciated, will keep an eye out in case other players around your region are having similar issues.","replies":[{"poster":"Lakinther","date":"2017-09-09T09:24:30.983+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i know its kinda old thread, but just let me tell you, i have had 10 telia routers in different locations, no difference whatsoever still same shit lag","replies":[]},{"poster":"Emorphic","date":"2017-07-11T17:09:42.926+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"as I stated TeliaSonera is in fact part of Riot's Peer, I hope they fix the routing issue. We have been experiencing lag issues since last month, before that routes were going through 'Level3' but were much smooth. \nI'm working on notifying each peer that is lagging through.\nMy outgoing peer is Bharti Airtel which initially lags 156ms which should be around 50ms but overall as I said internal routing also lags which I should be reporting here. After Country's initial peer the log is available for you to diagnose as it's relevant. \n\nReason for reporting log is to direct point exact Top level peers connected in communication. As you guys can now diagnose proper intermediate Routers.** As far as Initial routers are concerned** I assure you it has nothing to do with the lag caused by TeliaSonera and RiotDirect routers. Since these route doubles the ping, game is pretty unplayable, still I'm working on reporting each peer about issues starting from ISP to each intermediate peer.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Pheonixess","date":"2017-07-13T01:30:39.590+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been having this problem for a long time were my ping has been high (first went from 60 to 90), but recently my ping jumped to around a constant 160 in game, making it unplayable.
