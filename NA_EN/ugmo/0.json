So i tried a full client repair and that said an error has occurred. Then i deleted all of my stuff for league completely and redownloaded it and now i cant apply the patch 7.12 to the client because it says unspecified error occurred. I know that it is wrong with league because after the directX thing i tried csgo and it wouldnt load so i knew it was a graphics card thing but by now csgo works and not league. HELP ME... also rito this isnt good for the new players to the game who cant even play or load the game... Its almost like riot scammed me to because this happened right after i purchased the chaos set for the knew yasuo skin for $10...","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-17T03:58:45.770+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When you fully deleted League and started to reinstall, it sounds like your pc might be blocking the installer from running properly if you're getting an unexpected error.
