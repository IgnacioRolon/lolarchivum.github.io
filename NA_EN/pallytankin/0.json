If you're getting any sort of error message, screenshots would help a lot. Also confirming whether or not it successfully logs you in, then forces a log out, or if you \"log in\" but then it just redirects to the same page without you being logged in.  \n\nFor the game issue, it sounds like a ghost game.  This can happen sometimes when the game server fails to communicate the end-of-game message (basically saying \"Hey! I'm done now!\") to the PvP.net client.  Maximum time this can last is ~2 hours, though it often ends much much earlier.\n\nSorry for the wait, but if you see this frequently, lemme know since it could mean a different problem with your connection.","replies":[{"poster":"Aerin","date":"2016-03-30T02:50:30.614+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"this bug is all over reddit and the \"report a bug\" glitch.

Most of the time the LP gains/losses are just delayed, but should show up after a bit.","replies":[{"poster":"Aerin","date":"2016-03-31T00:58:40.127+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've sent a ticket and the Rioter said my match history is definitely missing a game.

Since the end-of-game message was delayed (causing the ghost game), the stats that go along with it are also delayed.   In some rare cases, the game stats could be lost, but I'm not seeing anything unusual at the moment.
