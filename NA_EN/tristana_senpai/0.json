I found on reddit that if you have all tf skins you can ask rito support to give you special offer in shop and be able to buy pax Twisted Fate, is that true? If it is not true do you plan on making it possible for Twisted Fate mains to get it if they have a lot of mastery points on Twisted Fate and having all skins at the same time?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-12-13T21:15:44.916+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nope, Pax skins are technically Limited per the[ legacy skins guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752944-Guide-to-Legacy-and-Limited-Skins), so it is unlikely to return to the store.
