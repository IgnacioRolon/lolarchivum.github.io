I&#039;ve been playing Primetime Draven as it is one of my personal favorite skins, but recently the skin has been having the Sound Effect of Pool Party Draven&#039;s axes.\r\nShould be an easy bug fix in next patch","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-11-01T19:58:44.416+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there! ^-^ \n\nThanks for the report! I wrote up a ticket for this issue, so it's logged for sure. Unfortunately, we're wrapping up the build for the upcoming patch (6.22), so it's unlikely we'll be able to get the fix in for the next patch. We'll do our best to get the fix in ASAP, though. :)","replies":[{"poster":"Smack My Ashe","date":"2016-11-04T09:53:07.365+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not a bug tho. There was a change to his Q AA sound in 6.21, which doesn't fit the skin at all. Sound similar to Pool Party tho.","replies":[]}]}]}
