I wasn't able to find any issues here, though, and everything looks okay.  DTN also provided some good context for more information on tag requirements.  In the client, select the group icon on your chat bar (the center icon), and then the gear icon.  You will see a toggle option for Show Club Tags that you will need to enable to see your tag.
