I think the skin might look better with lighter tones for her outfit or possibly a more sheer look to the material.  I also think that the hair would look better if it was more of a whitish color with a light purple ombre or something similar.  The color scheme just seems a little dark in comparison with Karma&#039;s skin.  Just some food for thought though, wasn&#039;t sure if anybody else thought the same thing.","replies":[{"poster":"Windfallen","date":"2015-05-14T03:07:21.660+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ya, the skin looks pretty rough compared... but that's to be expected. (I didnt even notice the Irelia skin on surrender@20 before this post lol)\n\nI think you're spot on right about the hair.\n\nHer blade seems to have a very minor translucency that hopefully becomes more noticeable like the way Karma's skirt is.\n\nWhile Karma's lotus skin looks very light, what makes it shout \"Lotus\" is the fact that it's lightest at the bottom and darkest at the top. Similar to the way a lotus is. That's the defining trait.... they can be lighter or darker in the center/outward fringes. Just image search \"Lotus\" and maybe you'll see that trait too. Some are lighter on the fringes and darker in the center... and others are vice versa.\n\nSo I think it's okay if Irelia's is darker (Maybe not as dark as it is right now, personally), but there needs to be more contrast from light to dark for each color. Her blouse shouldnt be such a flat pink/blue.","replies":[]},{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-05-14T17:41:02.289+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey guys,\n\nJust wanted to pop in and say thanks for the feedback! \n\nWe're currently in the process of grabbing feedback and discussing it. :]","replies":[{"poster":"GinoSoldier","date":"2015-05-14T22:19:07.628+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have a question for you. Has it ever been considered to create 'upgrades' to skins?\n\nHere we have a neat 750 skin, but later some extra lotus-y particles could be created and could be applied to her skin. I think Riot could offer to pay the 225RP difference between the base the 'would make the skin a 975 one' extras.\n\nOf course this can't quite apply to just any skin, but there are some which would highly benefit from such upgrades.\n\nAs far as this skin is concerned, I'd rather somewhat stronger colors on the blades and loop-wings, and i agree with other posters, lighter colors overall would probably be better.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Baron von Jiggly","date":"2015-05-14T02:57:08.446+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"in general she needs a serious model rework before they make her a new skin the gravity defying hair makes it look too weird with the polished textures","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lulu Made Me Big","date":"2015-05-15T02:36:28.758+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just saw the PBE update, the changes to her blouse look soooooo much better!

I can't stand it when the skins team does a skin that lacks vibrancy, esp when it needs that vivid colors.  \n\nI like it but Frostblade is better (because of the color issues) so I don't feel any need to get it as is.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Verum Veterum","date":"2015-05-15T19:53:35.777+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm an Irelia main, and consider Irelia to be my favorite champion.  So I'm really looking forward to the new skin ^^\n\nI really like the outfit's design and, to a lesser extent, the coloring of it (I thin it could be a little lighter), but my main problem is with the hair.  I understand why  you can't have, e.g., pink hair (it doesn't go well with her pink blouse), but why not make her hair light blue, kind of like,e.g., Sona's?  Or light green?  I just don't like the purple with the pink, but maybe it's just me.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Original Exile","date":"2015-05-15T16:01:12.848+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think for an order of the lotus Irelia. I think it would look really cool if a couple things happened, I think if you made the center piece of the blades a lotus that would be cool. You could do a lot with that on this, imagine if it \"bloomed\" when she activated hiten style? Or maybe putting a \"lotus\" in the floating pieces near her back?\n\n Just to stay somewhat close to the original in the skin line. Also while I enjoy the clothes coloring, it needs to be lighter. if you compare this skin with Karma's it doesn't really look like the same style you know?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Leu07","date":"2015-05-15T00:55:57.731+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think she should have tight pants...not baggy ones...and a little more armor maybe on the arms/legs....
