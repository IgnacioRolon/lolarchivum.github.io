I&#039;ve been wanting this skin forever and I&#039;m so glad riot finally made it. My only issue with this skin is that it seems very ... Well green. I would love to see some more pink incorporated into this skin. Possibly her hair, or the helmet or the top of her blouse. I feel like it would make it feel more cohesive with Miss Fortune and Hecarims arcade skins. I wasn&#039;t sure if anybody else had the same thought.","replies":[{"poster":"Kaelnor","date":"2015-08-05T19:05:31.150+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I don't agree, in fact it should be differing in some way.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-08-05T22:01:37.568+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":2,"body":"That goal here was to make her a bit different.

The particles are fantastic but the colors are too simple and just blend in with everything. The other main problem I have with the colors is the green-ness which Riven already has in all of her skins, making this skin remind you of her OTHER skins instead of being individual...","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"KalLain","date":"2015-08-06T08:10:25.094+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"I really don't know about this skin..\n\nI really like Riven as a champion too, and have been longing after a skin like this for her for a while, but the end-product is quite underwhelming.\nFor the overall design, I wish they'd have stuck to classic arcade games for inspiration, instead of mixing in - quite out of place IMO - some random Kingdom Hearts theme as well. \nThe splash, too, is quite a letdown. There's something about her face, something I just can't put my finger on, which makes it look weird/unlike her face in other skin-splashes. Perhaps it's because her face is completely devoid of emotion - quite the contrast to her other skins filled with nice powerful expressions.\nThe colourscheme, I agree, is also quite unflattering.\nThe in-game tweaks, VFXs and other stuff looks good, I'll give you that. But overall this skin has been quite a letdown, and feels sub-par, in terms of visual design and the quality of splash-art, compared to recent, cheaper skins, like Captain Fortune - which contradicts Riot's aspirations of continuously providing higher quality content. What a shame.\nLastly, I also feel like a skin to 1350RP (!) deserves its very own splash-art, seperate from the equally expensive Battle Boss Blitzcrank skin. But perhaps we just have to get used to Riot's recent trend of being cheapskates when it comes to splash-art of same-theme skins, in-which they just slap them all together in one (Pool Party Rek'Sai and Draven's loading screen slices, for instance, looks ridiculous due to their poor positioning in the splash, and the small space they occupy in it).\n\nThis became a longer rant than intended, but whatever.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-08-06T16:30:46.943+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hiya! \n\n> For the overall design, I wish they'd have stuck to classic arcade games for inspiration, instead of mixing in - quite out of place IMO - some random Kingdom Hearts \n\nWe took inspiration from several fighting games, Final Fantasy, and yes, even a bit of Kingdom Hearts. \n\n> The colourscheme, I agree, is also quite unflattering.\n\nWould you care to elaborate a bit on this one? \n\nWe chose to go with more greens and blues, since Arcade Miss Fortune was more focused on pinks and purples. Arcade Hecarim was centered a bit more around rainbows (although that's not what the Arcade theme is all about), and Sona's colors were more focused around the colors her kit was using. \n\n>I also feel like a skin to 1350RP (!) deserves its very own splash-art, seperate from the equally expensive Battle Boss Blitzcrank skin.\n\nWe felt this was an opportunity to give the skins more personality if we placed them in some kind of fighting game scenario, as to simply posing them in their own splash art.\n\n>  But perhaps we just have to get used to Riot's recent trend of being cheapskates when it comes to splash-art of same-theme skins, in-which they just slap them all together in one (Pool Party Rek'Sai and Draven's loading screen slices, for instance, looks ridiculous due to their poor positioning in the splash, and the small space they occupy in it).\n\nThis is a similar instance to my above comment, where we could give each champion more personality, rather than just having them in a pose by themselves.\n\nThat said, there are some cases where this is warranted, and others where a champion needs their own splash. It's decided on a case by case basis.","replies":[{"poster":"Academy Kayn","date":"2015-08-06T21:05:03.756+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What puts me off is the contrast of the light blue of her helmet with the green of her hair.
