Otherwise it just looks like you're overpricing stuff.","replies":[]},{"poster":"FatedTitan","date":"2014-12-04T16:10:09.331+0000","up_votes":26,"down_votes":4,"body":"This sounds like Mellow Mushroom pricing scheme.  \"We know it looks like a regular pizza, but trust us.  This cheese is of the utmost quality from a special area of Italy that no one else has.  It's definitely worth being a bit more expensive.\"  I give in and order the pizza.  I take a bite and realize that the cheese tastes exactly the same as Pizza Hut, but I paid double the price.\n\nI know you guys want to make money.  You're a business.  But the prices are radically ridiculous.  It's like you're looking to gain a ton of capital quickly so you can expand the store into more things when it launches for real.  Let's go through everything.\n\n1. Hoodies at $80 are too much.  That's a $50 hoodie.  Remember a few months ago how Riot lowered the prices on some skins that the community felt did not meet the standards set for their price points.  Riot finally gave in and lowered them, stating that \"though we feel the skins do meet the previous price points, they do not visually show it very well.\"  In other words, even though Pink Taric may have been 975 quality, to the players comparing other 975 skins to it, it looked like a glorified recolor.  So it was lowered.  The hoodies may be made of some of the best material around, and I'm sure you put your heart into it.  But I'm not paying for your heart.  I'm paying for a hoodie.  And that hoodie looks like it's worth $50.  \"We want it to last a long time though!\"  I'm sure you do.  And I can go buy a $20 hoodie at Walmart that'll last me five years easy.  What makes it worth $80?  Saying you're using certain materials and it glows isn't something we can see visually in the picture and won't be that big of an attraction to those looking to purchase it.  You're telling me there's a special kind of cheese in it, but it tastes the same as Pizza Hut.  At the end of the day, it's still just a hoodie.\n\n2.  Mini figurines costing $25 is funny.  It's just as big as a coffee cup, it's not an in game model of the champion, and it looks cheap.  Why would I buy this for $25 when I can buy something of (what looks like) better quality in a Skylander or Amiibo figure that is only $10-$15?  \n\n3.  T-shirts are debatable I suppose.  I'd like to see them around $20 and accept it.  $20 is a bit much for me, but I don't think $25 is extremely overpriced on these or anything.\n\n4.  Plushes and hats are about $10 too much for each of their respective prices.  I can go to Build a Bear and get a $15 bear and sow a buttonon it's eye if I want it that bad.  And the hats are the worst offenders of overpriced in the store I'd say.  I wanted a Teemo hat a few years ago, so I went to the old Riot store and looked for one.  $40.  I laughed at the thought of paying $40 for a Teemo hat.  I then went to eBay and searched for Teemo hat and found one for $3 with free shipping.  It was a no brainer.  I say the same thing now.  $20-$25 for one of these hats is too much, especially when I can go to eBay and get them for 90% cheaper than here.  And before people say \"it was a fake\", it was completely legit.  Had every single thing any other Teemo hat has.  \n\n5.  The Thresh statue is laughable.  $80 for it?  Come on now Riot.  You know as well as I do that that is a $50 statue.  You pay $15 for each of those statues from your manufacturer.  I bought a Pulsefire Ezreal statue on eBay for $50 and felt it was a decent price.  $80 is just bad.  It's like you aren't even trying.  And don't use the Mellow Mushroom argument on me here.  You can claim to use the best processes and best looking materials, but to an outsider, it doesn't look worth $80 at all.\n\n6.  Posters should be $10.  Great posters, too much.  I can take the pictures of those posters, go to a print store in town, and get them to print me one off for $5.  \n\n\nThese are just my opinions obviously.  And I know that there are enough people who play League who have big enough wallets that you'll probably sell out of all your products.  But you alienate the vast portion of your fanbase with these price points.  \"When we launch, we're going to have many more price points.\"  Yea, I believe you.  But if these previews are an indication of what you feel is the price point of this quality product, I can only imagine the terrible quality I'd get for a $10 purchase.  \n\nI'm not trying to be rude or accuse you of price gouging here, but to an outsider, that's what it looks like.  You may be the official store, but the people with the pockets deep enough to consistently purchase at this price will fall drastically and you'll be making no money quickly.  When only 1-2% of your playerbase feels these are fair prices, you're in trouble.\n\nAnd yes, I'm aware that this is a Beta.  I'm just afraid that Beta will move forward quickly into Live and prices will stay super high.  As my experience with Riot has been over the years, if it hits Beta, it'll take pitchforks and death threats to stop it from going Live.  And even then, that's only if Riot has an affinity for that champion (no one at Riot liked old Trundle, but they all love Lee Sin).  I want Riot to be successful as well, but this isn't the way to do it.  We're paying $30 extra on some products here just for the name brand.  \n\nAnd this time next year, I'll be able to go to a third party seller and get these things for half of what they cost now.  \n\n\nLast thing then I'm done.  Riot better hope those Thresh hoodies are as high quality as they want us to believe.  Because the first one that isn't as high quality as they're building it up to be, Reddit is going to explode and it's going to be a PR nightmare.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"THE 10086","date":"2014-12-05T20:25:21.267+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello there ：\n\nI am a 3d printing Figures designer from Taiwan.\n\nThese are my 3d printing Figures：\n\nhttp://imgur.com/ERaS3Ae\n\nhttp://pic.pimg.tw/jyredlin/1409262516-2924308943.gif\n\nhttp://imgur.com/d2HvZrS\n\nhttp://imgur.com/pfAwTwF\n\nhttp://imgur.com/PeAsRxm\n\nYou can see more in my blog\n\nhttp://jyredlin.pixnet.net/blog\n\nThe Blizzard has interviewed me in May .\n\nhttp://tw.battle.net/wow/zh/blog/14223387/\n\nI am dreaming that one day my Figures\n\nCan be Official Goods in the new physical merchandise store.\n\nPlease contact me ：）\n\njy3dmaker@gmail.com","replies":[]},{"poster":"OH NO ITS LU BU","date":"2014-12-04T14:44:40.449+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"We crashed it already.","replies":[{"poster":"RedBeard","date":"2014-12-04T14:52:03.303+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":0,"body":"Community OP","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CBT Wizard","date":"2014-12-04T14:55:51.215+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":2,"body":"Big suggestion on the figures/statues: Please include what they are made out of in the item description.  $70.00 US for that Thresh statue is a bit much for something that appears to be the same quality as $25-$30.00 NECA/DC Direct statues.
