We know that many of you have been excited about merch for a while now, which is why we’re excited to finally share our plans to soon launch a beta version of the Riot Games Merch Store.\n\nWe spent the past year building a team specifically dedicated to creating merch and developing an experience that we hope resonates with all of you as League of Legends players and fans.\n\nToday I’m joined by Bradmore (our director of merch) and Riot Tocelot (aka JLeezy, our senior manager leading our store efforts), and we’re going to share some info around our plans for the future of merch and also talk about some of the decisions we made when we kicked off this whole journey. This’ll include why we created a new merch store, why we’re launching in beta and what to expect if your region is not part of the initial beta roll-out. We also want to talk about a few of the items we plan to launch with and how some of that merch came to life. So let’s get rolling… ask us anything!\n\n**Edit: We are heading back to work to get cranking on getting the store up and running. Will try to check periodically on the post to answer any questions that may be bubbling up. *I love you.***","replies":[{"poster":"Envoy of the End","date":"2014-12-01T18:45:19.916+0000","up_votes":115,"down_votes":1,"body":"What are the odds of eventually stocking Gnar onesies?","replies":[{"poster":"RedBeard","date":"2014-12-01T18:50:18.695+0000","up_votes":206,"down_votes":0,"body":"omg rito plz","replies":[{"poster":"iHuggs","date":"2014-12-01T19:57:11.301+0000","up_votes":58,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dino Gnar onesies would complete me.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"RyuSerabii","date":"2014-12-01T18:18:08.637+0000","up_votes":100,"down_votes":3,"body":"I think I speak for the people when I ask;\n\nWill you guys sell official Poro plushies?\n\nedit: And maybe a Baron ","replies":[{"poster":"RedBeard","date":"2014-12-01T18:20:14.644+0000","up_votes":160,"down_votes":2,"body":"Does a bear poop in the woods?","replies":[{"poster":"Jkalltheway","date":"2014-12-01T18:55:39.732+0000","up_votes":141,"down_votes":4,"body":"> Does a bear poop in the woods?\n\nWell that would depend on whether you're talking polar bear, Panda, or a brown/black/grizzly bear. In the case of the polar bear, i can be fairly certain that the polar bear must poop either in the ocean or on snow/ice while in the case of the others, they do poop in the woods with the exception of the panda bear which must watch videos of other bears pooping in order to learn how to properly poop. \n\nAnd in the case of the Chicago Bears, they must poop in their lavish mansions, and sometimes, they'll take a poop on the field.\n\nSo my counter counter question is: what's with the bears yo?","replies":[{"poster":"RedBeard","date":"2014-12-01T18:59:49.814+0000","up_votes":76,"down_votes":3,"body":"This is some serious analysis.
