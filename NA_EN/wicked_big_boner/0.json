After playing for about a year I don't have a problem last hitting but with little experience playing in a lane I often find myself losing trades and eventually dying repeatedly even while playing safe and only trying to CS. \r\n\r\nMy question is if I don't get Jungle what is the safest role/champion to learn in order to farm and avoid negatively impacting my team, at least until team fights begin. (I almost never get caught out or overextend I just die to my lane post 6 i.e. Zed LB Talon Annie)","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-27T18:05:09.095+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was never good at trading/CS and keeping track of what's going on in the river/jungle at the same time. While I liked the ADC champs, I simply never got good at it. I chose to play a lot of jungle for the very same reasons you stated here, but then I found my primary role, which is support. \n\nWith support, you're still in a lane keeping track of minions, but you're simply staying in an advantageous position to chunk down the enemy ADC while saving your wombo combos for the right moment. I strongly recommend learning some of the easier support champs such as Leona and Nami. They can dish out decent damage but if you land their ults or combos just right, you can change the outcome of any teamfight.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions, best of luck out there! ^.^","replies":[]}]}
