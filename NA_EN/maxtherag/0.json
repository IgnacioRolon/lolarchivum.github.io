I was told that &quot;It was good that my parents left me as a baby because I was already so retarded that they didn&#039;t want their stupidity to make me any worse&quot;. Now as someone who has lost their mother to cancer only a year ago, this is absolutely Intolerable. What was even worse was, the child (I can only imagine a child being so cruel) that was saying this to me had a friend in chat. After I told him &quot;You&#039;re being very disrespectful&quot; and asked the enemy team to report him, His buddy went into all chat and told them i was lying, and to report me. I know that my account is safe, but its knowing that this guy can continue to harass people.He will continue for sometime forward until enough people report him that Riot takes a look. I understand that people shouldn&#039;t get banned for the occasional slip up, but this child Assailed, Belittled, and impugned, my friend and I for a solid 25 minutes. If a Riot employee reads this I invite you to go into my match history, find the game where i played Katrina, and just read the chat please. It&#039;s even worse when I consider the fact that he is probably a smurf and doesn&#039;t  even care if he gets banned. If the attitude of the boy continues to be the stereotypical attitude of League of Legends, I&#039;m afraid that this game is simply to far gone, and I will cease to play. Thank you all for your time. Goodnight\n\nATTENTION: Thank you all for your support, but lets not let this die here.

Being called names and told hateful things by some random stranger should be totally meaningless to you. They don't know you, they don't know how good or bad a person you are, they don't know any hardships you've faced, their opinion is literally *meaningless* to your life, and you shouldn't give them the power to make their opinions matter. You are who you've grown up as, not whatever trash they say about you. It's not like you are hearing this spite from a trusted friend or a family member who's ashamed of you. Saying this game is a lost cause because of some random jerks saying hurtful things to you is like saying you'll never go to New York City ever again because a homeless guy on a street corner said you were an idiot and deserved to die in a hole. It simply doesn't stack up. I'm not saying the vitriol that these guys were saying wasn't crude, offensive, or that it was not deserving of punishment, I'm just saying it is only as hurtful as you allow it to be, and letting it just roll off your back is the easiest way to overcome it.\n\nI really sympathize with you a lot, I've had a lot of personal struggles as well (although nothing as severe as the loss of a parent, I offer my deepest condolences), and When I just started League it was easy to let the vile spew of the smurfs make me feel bad, but I am confident that you can also overcome it with relative ease, not by \"accepting it\" as an inevitability, but by knowing it is nothing more than the idle chatter of thoughtless fools.","replies":[{"poster":"frigginmurlocs","date":"2015-11-08T02:16:42.944+0000","up_votes":61,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your TL;DR is longer than the rest of your post","replies":[{"poster":"Transgressor","date":"2015-11-08T12:09:21.265+0000","up_votes":22,"down_votes":1,"body":"Your correct usage of 'than\" pleases me IMMENSLY.

My personal advice is to use the mute button *liberally.* Honestly especially at pre-30, there is absolutely nothing gameplay-wise that needs to be said; pings are 100% sufficient (hit control or alt, then click and drag, or just click). So if you even *think* someone might be about to go off the hook at you, jute mute them, no harm done. And obviously report if you see anything happen.\n\n2. Agreed that you should not need to tolerate, but unfortunately this is just how some people are right now. Riot's working to change it, but it takes time.\n\n3. Rest assured that as you get higher leveled and more skilled, toxicity decreases.

I sometimes get mad over games, too, but I try not to effect or upset others, I try to resolve it myself. When it's a bad game, I tell myself, \"Bad games happen, just try to learn and have fun and move on to the next.\" Unfortunately many people can't do that. \nI must say I've met many nice people, too, the people who say nothing even if you made a huge mistake and congratulates you on your nice plays.\nMute and report is your best friends. Just try to ignore those people and try to enjoy games.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ulanopo","date":"2015-11-08T19:03:06.785+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"When League first came out, I didn't want to play because of my experiences with DotA. My friends basically had to bully me into trying it. \n\nI will say that I had a couple of bad experiences, but I made some decisions about how to approach those early levels that really helped:\n\n* The mute button is your best friend. This is especially true with the new ping system.\n* Take a buddy. It reduces toxicity by at least 25%. Besides which, playing with your friends is usually pretty awesome.\n* Play for fun sometimes. Treating every game like an all-or-nothing deathmatch can turn you into the monster you see in others.\n* Along those same lines, sometimes it's time for a break.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TBakes","date":"2015-11-08T17:43:37.541+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is a societal problem, not a problem with LoL or gamers or children. This is a problem with society and the anonymity of the internet. Riot will never be able to eradicate this behavior because people will continue to exhibit this behavior as long as they have no consequences. It makes me sad :(\n\nHowever, this behavior is not as common as we perceive it to be. It is simply that this interaction will be branded into your brain much more vividly than any neutral or positive experience you have (up to 400x more vividly). It is human nature. Just ask Lyte!

And let's be real, in the heat of the moment, not everyone stops to consider who's on the other end of the screen. I'm not trying to justify it, since it's absolutely scummy, but that's _why_ it happens. It gets even worse in a competitive environment like League.\n\nAt the end of the game, make those reports-- they _do_ add up. Take advantage of the mute feature, too-- it can make the game go much more smoothly. I've had to go and switch off all chat for a while because it just got out of hand (which is a shame, because I have met some amazing {{champion:45}} players in mirror matches).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Draqone","date":"2015-11-08T07:57:43.654+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You know, I may be an exception but I never mute people.

But the issue is they're outnumbered several thousand to 1. Not only that, but even if the person harassing does get banned, there's nothing stopping them from just making another account (One of the many reasons I think this game should be restricted to one account only) It's sad, but that's the reality of it\n\nNice post :)  I do disagree with you on the only one account thing but this is a minor issue as I believe with the new system that Riot will start picking off smurfs that only have that account to make others players experience bad/nasty or whatever way you want to say it.  \n\nRiot is going a long way to make this game the best around, They are trying new things and using the newest systems to do so.  I'm very impressed with them.  I only hope they continue to stand up for the rights of those like me/you/ others and OP. \n\nWe should be able to play without taking abuse.
