I got challenger in season 5 by playing MID with champs like fizz, ahri, xerath etc People on season 5 called me scripter but i never got a ban because even if i got reported the systems couldn&#039;t detect any 3rd party program because i don&#039;t even play in windows..\r\n\r\nThen i got challenger again on season 6 playing only ahri..\r\nRiot implemented their &quot;new report system&quot; in where people could report people for cheating just because they want\r\n\r\nThen after getting called out a lot of times i got tired. I installed windows on my mac and immediately installed plays.tv so i could proof i don&#039;t use any &quot;scripting&quot; program by recording my plays and stuff..\r\n\r\nThen after some days of playing on windows riot sent me an email saying i&#039;m banned? like wtf\r\nI have proofs on my plays.tv in where everybody can see how am i playing with my friends, ranking to get more points in challenger\r\n\r\nalso.. if their systems detected any &quot;scripting program&quot; as they said after i talked to them why aren&#039;t my smurfs banned? smurfs in where i play the same champions as my main account. Oh, i know why they are not banned.. the reason is because in elo like diamond5, platinum and gold people don&#039;t report for cheating just because they are mad..\r\n\r\nI have even played on ESL tournaments.. You think an scripter would play stuff like that? in where you could get to finals then play in a place where everybody can see you?\r\nThat doesn&#039;t make any sense Riot.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m actually playing the Mexican E-sports League And also i&#039;m playing the Riot Open Blue Come on, there are no &quot;scripters&quot; that would play that stuff..\r\n\r\nIt&#039;s not fair that because of dumb people just reporting because they want, a normal player like me getting banned for no reason.&#039;\r\n\r\nLink to my Op.gg\r\nhttp://lan.op.gg/summoner/userName=fatalis\r\n\r\nLink to my plays.tv\r\nwww.plays.tv/fatalis","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-02-23T22:41:18.746+0000","up_votes":23,"down_votes":7,"body":"Hey!\n\n>  I** installed windows** on my mac and immediately **installed plays.tv**.  \n\nTwo questions on that - is it a legit Windows copy?
