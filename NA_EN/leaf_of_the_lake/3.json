Its optimal use case is to use it to get directly in the opponent&#039;s face with it, hitting with all 7 rockets for a whopping 165-330 (+77% AP) damage. For the slightly less optimal scenario where you hit with 5, it&#039;s still 135-270 (+63% AP). There is no other item in the game that offers that much additional burst when you buy it, and this is on a 2500 gold item (that is already close to gold efficiency without its active). The closest thing in competition to it is GLP, which does 100-250 (+35% AP) and slows, but doesn&#039;t require being directly on top of them. \r\n\r\nLike, it&#039;s good on immobile champs like annie, tf, galio, etc. But I&#039;d say it&#039;s even better on stuff like... liss, kennen, sona (hey why not), ahri, lulu, elise, grag, vlad, and probably a couple others I&#039;m forgetting. All champs that already can get in your face if they want to, and all benefit from the additional burst.","replies":[]}
