But a lot of the time I see Renektons base skin, my fps drops 10-15 frames. It took me a long time to narrow down the champs that I thought could be causing it. But I think I've finally concluded its Renekton. Unfortunately I can't recreate this in the practice tool, I've tried a few times but it seems to only happen in live games. \r\n\r\nWhen renekton comes out of the fog of war, my fps drops. If he ults, it drops by another couple frames. I'm fairly certain its not my pc, as I've never experienced this issue in the last few years. \r\n\r\nI just read a Riot post saying that theres a team tackling alot of bugs that cause FPS drop, I would like them to look into Renekton and see if theres any merit to my complaint.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-23T02:42:28.494+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First things first, try running a quick repair to make sure it's not some game files messing up. It's worth the time to rule out any other possibilities, like updating graphics drivers and DirectX files.\n\nHave you been able to bug report this through the client yet? Posts here on H&S about potential bugs likely won't get noticed, so be sure to report anything like this in the client using the bug report button in the bottom right corner.","replies":[{"poster":"Volibears Keeper","date":"2018-01-23T02:46:15.296+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ah ok. I updated all my stuff when I noticed this about a week ago. I'll give repair tool a shot. \n\nIf that doesnt work Ill go through client. Thanks!","replies":[]}]}]}
