I&#x27;m still looking forward to your reaction when we finally get the Riot version out there.\n\nFrom someone who said to me 3 months before that Ionia should be smaller and southern land should be bigger. He is not rioter but he does work related to LOL, so I believe that he knows something. \n\n\nI put mountain to separate shurima and icathia because an ancient kingdom that keep itself independent and unique for long time must have some natural advantages to accomplish it. Besides, for such a large area non-mountain seems not reasonable.\n\nThe whole southern continent is based on some simple geographic knowledge, like the distribution of tropical, desert, prairie etc. That mountain is from the lore of Bandle city, saying \"nobody knows where are yordles, someone say they are hiding in the southeast mountain\". So, there is definitely a mountain.\n\nIn the unknown regions there may be primitive lost tribes, human or non-human ,or more human-like creatures. Dangerous areas like jungles, deserts, and some other existings we can never imagine. Even some lost civilization wastes, or ruines of big old civilizations like targon.\n\nSpeaking of targon, I am always interested by them. Targon is absolutely a big group or nation or civilization or whatever in \"pre-history ages\" in runeterra.\n\nSince they have already immigrated to the universe and were able to control Aurelian sol,I think they are high civilization not only now but also in past times. Imagine Atlantis , the lost continent in real world.\n\n\nSo, that whole big land, southern continent, including the unknown parts, could all belong to Targons ,where they built empires and civilizations, controlling all the runeterra from the center which lies in southern continent. Mount targon is just a man-made construction , like a tower to connect the runeterra and the space. \n\n I hope all that southern lands should be mysterious, legendary, unknown for modern society, and far away from nowadays human civilizations in Valoran. (Since that shurima icathia and Targon mountains, those ancient civilizations are all there). We can build this continent as an ancient enormous lands, much bigger than valoran , making the LOL world more potential, where there are things similar as  ancient Egypt, Sumerian civilizations( the earliest human civilization in real world), and Maya( we can creat America-like things there too).\n\nSuch a big continent (or two continents, one of which we can't see yet in the other side of Southern Continent), belongs to the first generation of runeterra ,The Targon, or even Targon is the second generation there was one more!!\n\nThis unknown regions along with the known region could be a good place to film documentary like Discover in that world!!m\n\nBtw, what is the progress of world map making?i can't wait ! Ca we see regions map like piltover in advance?\n\n\nBtw, what about the progress of world making? I can't wait!
