Badges/Titles will last until the end of November.\n\n2. If somebody manages to win more than once, they can only have one badge/title and must pick.\n\n3. Rolls for the awards are valid anywhere on Riot's Boards, not just this thread.\n---\nThere's no guarantee this will happen once the awards are given out, since I thought it could be a fun little thing to do in light of a new feature.","replies":[]}
