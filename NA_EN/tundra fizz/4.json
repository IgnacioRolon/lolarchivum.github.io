If the only thing you used Grease/Tampermonkey for was FEK, then you can uninstall that script manager as well.\n\nFEK 5.0 will be having frequent updates to quickly bring back all of the features that existed in 4.0\n\nIf you want you can check out 5.0 you can do so in the thread below. Please note that it's not finished yet and using it with Discussion Mode can be extremely buggy! Currently it's only recommended to use Chronological Mode with 5.0 but I hope to fix that soon.\n\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/GD/VZXIG5LR-fek-version-51","replies":[{"poster":"Tundra Fizz","date":"2015-07-17T17:22:30.366+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":1,"body":"**FEK Features**\n\nYou can customize FEK to your liking and turn off some features if you don't like them by [using the Control Panel](http://i.imgur.com/OaB7AxX.jpg).\n---\n\n**Avatars and Status Icons**\n\n[As seen in the first post](http://i.imgur.com/cfLwfdB.jpg), there are status indicators. There are many different avatar size options from 100x100 to 200x200.\n\n---\n\n**Fallback Avatars**\n\nIf you would rather not see a person's summoner icon if they don't have a FEK avatar, multiple options are available to replace those. Fizz's Trident, Poro, and Happy Cloud.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/ETJQDlJ.png[/img]\nhttp://i.imgur.com/gN3PoCe.png[/img]\nhttp://i.imgur.com/t9RRqTp.png[/img]\n\n---\n\n**User Pop-up**\n\nWhen you hover your mouse over somebody's avatar, a pop-up box will appear. In it will be many useful links:\n\n* **View Profile:** Opens up their board's profile in a new window\n* **View Avatar:** Opens up their FEK avatar in a new window\n* **LoLNexus:** Opens up their LoLNexus page in a new window\n* **OP.GG:** Opens up their op.gg page in a new window\n* **Blacklist:** Adds/Removes them from your blacklist\n\nThis feature is integral to FEK and can only be disabled if you disable avatars.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/MM0jVEx.jpg[/img]\n\n---\n\n**Enhanced Voting**\n\nHover your mouse over somebody's votes and it will display either the total votes on the post/thread, or it will show individual upvotes and downvotes. By default, the latter is selected but you can toggle it in the FEK control panel.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/lNzShwO.png[/img]\nhttp://i.imgur.com/Q5JYlX9.png[/img]\nhttp://i.imgur.com/NDclSdu.png[/img]\nhttp://i.imgur.com/Skhi8WJ.png[/img]\n\nYou also have the option to completely remove votes as well.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/JepoVLn.png[/img]\nhttp://i.imgur.com/XZHsPDi.jpg[/img]\nhttp://i.imgur.com/lNH9YfK.jpg[/img]\n\n---\n\n**Blacklisting**\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/LqBQjn6.jpg[/img]\n\nTo blacklist somebody, hover your mouse over their avatar and click on the \"Blacklist\" link.\nhttp://i.imgur.com/P5AAevZ.gif[/img]\n\nYou will receive an alert.\nhttp://i.imgur.com/tIqUlIH.png[/img]\n\nClick on the \"Blacklist\" tab on the FEK control panel to view the people you have blacklisted.

Furthermore, champion/item/summoner icons are now displayed as well so you no longer have to see something like \\{{champion:105}} \n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/AneV3d3.png[/img]\nhttp://i.imgur.com/YELdMpM.jpg[/img]\nhttp://i.imgur.com/1Zsteqx.png[/img]\n\n---\n\n**Thread Highlighting**\n\nThreads you make will be highlighted in a different color so you can see them easier.

This is likely not permanent.\n\nMy reasons for doing this is as follows:\n\n* People on computers/mobile devices without FEK would show up as red/offline, even though they are actively posting\n* Badge space becomes very crowded for some people, and people will be getting season badges soon which will only make it more crowded\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/ufn5ty6.jpg[/img]\n---\n**Bug Fix: .webm issues**\n\n=== Before ===\nhttp://i.imgur.com/BncWQZC.jpg[/img]\n\n=== After ===\nhttp://i.imgur.com/njVAi1F.jpg[/img]\n---\n**Bug Fix: avatar error in Discussion View**\n\n=== Before ===\nhttp://i.imgur.com/t2s5kj0.jpg[/img]\n\n=== After ===\nhttp://i.imgur.com/jD6eH62.jpg[/img]\n---\n**New: Roll the die**\n\nTyping [roll] will generate a random number 1 to 1000 in its place. This is for fun and maybe some people can think of some use for it.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/ucy0hc5.jpg[/img]\n---\n**New: Error handling**\n\nIn the past, Riot would alter the Boards in such a way that it would break FEK. This is extremely annoying because announcements then fail to work so nobody knows what's going on. Now whenever something goes wrong, FEK will gracefully recover itself and continue on and an error message will be left in the upper-right corner of the screen.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/G9T1YsM.jpg[/img]\n---\n**New: Favorite icons**\n\nYou can now customize the Champion/Spell/Item icons! Select your favorites from the FEK control panel by pressing the ~ button. Note that not all items are available, because of the sheer amount that exist.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/DlrteUJ.jpg[/img]\n---\n**New: Hide boards from main page**\n\nDo you visit the main page often, but just don't care about some Boards? Select \"Hidden Boards\" on the FEK control panel and check all Boards that you would like to hide.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/lop2NQv.jpg[/img]\nhttp://i.imgur.com/kLB0pzz.jpg[/img]\n---\n**New: More color options for thread highlighting**\n\nYou can now choose an assorted color to highlight your threads.

This has now been fixed.\n\nBefore\nhttp://i.imgur.com/8xqxluY.png[/img]\n\nAfter\nhttp://i.imgur.com/UjU3t39.png[/img]\n---\n**Bug Fix:** Black Bar\n\nIf your browser's window is too wide, a horizontal scrollbar will appear and an annoying black bar will appear.  This has now been fixed.\n\nBefore\nhttp://i.imgur.com/eVv4xmz.jpg[/img]\n\nAfter\nhttp://i.imgur.com/QOBPB9w.jpg[/img]\n---\n**Bug Fix:** Junk Text\n\nSometimes when loading a webpage you'll see a bunch of crap that's a part of the FEK control panel. It can be pretty annoying so you will no longer see this happen.\n\nRemoved\nhttp://i.imgur.com/3NzOVv5.jpg[/img]\n---\n**Bug Fix:** User Popup Boxes\n\nSometimes when you hover your mouse over a person's name/avatar (as seen by the underlined name in both images), the popup box would fail to appear. This has now been fixed.\n\nBefore\nhttp://i.imgur.com/BIHRVvw.jpg[/img]\n\nAfter\nhttp://i.imgur.com/FxfORGW.png[/img]\n---\n**Bug Fix:** Blacklisting\n\nThere was a bug where blacklisted people would still have their threads appear on a Boards index. This has now been fixed.\n\nAnother change is that the blacklist on the FEK control panel now updates when you click on the tab, rather than you needing to refresh the page.\n---\n**Miscellaneous**\n\nTwo additional things I am currently working on:\n\n* Minimizing posts in Discussion View\n\n* Buggy .webm avatars\n\nSince .webm avatars are currently bugged, I have replaced a couple people's .webms with .gifs. I'll put their .webms back once the bug gets fixed.\n---\n**Click the link below to download the latest version of FEK.**\n\nhttps://tundrafizz.com/FEK.user.js\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mongoose","date":"2015-07-17T20:04:47.457+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":2,"body":"This needs to be a sticky","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tundra Fizz","date":"2016-12-10T01:28:52.336+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"**Changelog 4.6.0**\n---\n**Overview**\n\n* **Bug Fix:** Database Synchronization\n* **New:** Season Six Badges\n---\n**Bug Fix:** Database Synchronization\n\nThere was a problem that remained when Riot changed the style of the Boards about a month ago which caused FEK to not send new usernames to the database.
