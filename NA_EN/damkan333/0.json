THE SEEN BLADE: Shadows created by W - Living Shadow and R - Death Mark are now marked by a circular team indicator.\nand the last yet terrible nerfs, the assassin update :(\n-patch 6.22 : W - Living Shadow\nREMOVED OVER THE TOP: No longer provides 4/8/12/16/20% bonus attack damage so whats the point of building ad on zed again?\nENERGY RETURN ON MULTI-HIT: 20/25/30/35/40 ? 30/35/40/45/50 irrelevant.\nSHADOW SWAP RANGE: 1100 ? 1300 this is nice but irrelevant compared to all the damage lost in pure and percentage damage.\nE - Shadow Slash: COOLDOWN: 4 seconds at all ranks ? 5/4.5/4/3.5/3 seconds this ruined zed early game forever .\nDAMAGE: 60/90/120/150/180 ? 65/90/115/140/165 this is an overall 15 atk dmg decrease resulting in a terrible mid late game.\n- Death Mark: NEW SHADOW REAPING: Whenever Death Mark kills an enemy, Zed steals their shadow for himself, gaining a portion of their attack damage. Zed can only possess one shadow at a time, and only steals a new shadow if it would give him more damage.\nREAPING BONUS: 5 attack damage + 5/10/15% of the target’s total attack damage. this requires a full on assassination only benefit at lvl 6 up and has less damage late and mid game then building ad. this means that what zed was so good at playing vs mages is irrelevant (especially in a control mage meta) + going after adcarry's that can just build crit so you get negative agvantage and tops that are tanks!\nOne last thing how are new players and smurfs meant to benefit from zed's \"strengths\" without having him with full runes and masteries?\nit's is the worst feeling in the world to get zed in a box or buy him for 6300 ip and realize that without full stuff he is an irrelevant champion.\n\nLet's some up all the damage taken out of zed's kit : pure damage = -20 -25 -15 = -60 overall pure damage (add - 60 damage for 1 less early totaling at -120 overall damage  )\nnow percentage damage = -5% -5% -10% -20%(w passive obliterated) = - 40% percentage damage !\nplus in assassin update talon ad went from 55 to 60 which is 5 red ad runes more, and zed's stayed at 54.712\nalso must say that the developpers did not test zed when working on him only messed negatively with his numbers.\nalso all zeds spells exept ultimate that requires lot's of damage on top to be usefull is bonus ad meaning that champs like pantheon run free out there with 140 % and 300% total ad on q spell of 4 secs cooldown etc ... you get my point difference in win rates out 55% (pantheon) and 47% (zed)\nalso all shields, support items and spells make zed assassinating very poor with all these damage decreases.\n\nconclusion: season 6 murdered zed.\nPlease upvote this post zed mains rebels yourselves and make zed a relevant villain again also so we can get a glimpse of him back in the pro series have faker and bjergsen consider him and help new zed players lvl 1-30 appreciate him !","replies":[]},{"poster":"SnugglePuggle94","date":"2017-02-03T23:13:19.315+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He doesn't need buffs plus he just got some from the Lethality changes.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CrimsonReaps","date":"2017-02-03T17:59:26.871+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Does he need them?","replies":[{"poster":"singiel38","date":"2017-02-03T19:48:27.545+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"no imo","replies":[]}]}]}
