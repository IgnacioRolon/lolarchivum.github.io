I had originally posted this in a LoL FB group, but someone suggested I should post it on the boards so...why not? \r\n\r\nA few days ago, my boyfriend proposed to me. (Well, I guess he's my fiance now.) We met on League of Legends and became very close friends, and years later we ended up in a long distance relationship. I wanted to thank Riot for this, so I sent them an e-mail, but I might as well post it on here, maybe it'll be easier for someone from Riot to read this. \r\n\r\n(Here are some pictures of us together, btw: http://imgur.com/a/c1x5o)\r\n\r\n\"Hey Riot. I wasn't sure where to send this, so I hope this goes through.\r\n\r\nMy name is Vanessa, and I wanted to take some time to thank you for helping me meet the love of my life. (Wow, that sounds cheesy.) I met my fiance on LoL around four years ago, we instantly clicked and became close friends for a very long time. We eventually started dating and went into a long distance relationship. A couple days ago he proposed to me.\r\n\r\nWe were able to bond and become closer because of League, and we really can't thank you enough. The odds of us meeting were one in a million, and the fact I was able to find him through something we both love is a miracle for me. LoL was just one of the games that helped nurture and make our relationship closer throughout the long distance period. When he was stationed in Turkey and I was still in the states, playing games together made us closer and it made me feel like he wasn't so far away. There have been many fun and hilarious moments playing bot lane together, and they are probably my fondest memories with him.\r\n\r\nAgain, I just wanted to thank you. I was able to find someone that was my other half, someone who understood me for who I was, and someone who loved video games like myself.\r\n\r\nI hope I can make someone reading this happy, because we certainly are.\r\n\r\nThanks again,\r\n\r\nVanessa (Nehssa)\"","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2016-03-31T18:28:31.671+0000","up_votes":31,"down_votes":0,"body":"The League of Legends Community is making me feel so many things ;--; Congrats you two!

It's hard enough sometimes when you're together in real life and there's a misunderstanding, and you have to work it out. It's even harder when you only have phone, Skype, etc. Many long distance relationship have ended also because of trust issues, which also goes under the category of communication. \n\nKeep yourselves entertained too. Find things to do together to stay happy together. Try to keep your partner in the loop, let them know what's going on in your life so they feel included since they are so far away. It is not easy at all, but if you guys work it out and pull through, your relationship will only get stronger and you'll see it was very worth it.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"XeroKimo","date":"2016-03-31T20:00:11.528+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ehhhhh just like Keyori an Jaynee!!!!
