If not or if you're still experiencing this issue, it could also be due to corrupt game files preventing you from launching the game properly.  \n\nAs a first step, I recommend going over the steps in our [Patching Issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202969434-Patching-Issues#wq5) guide as well as [running a repair](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202969434-Patching-Issues#wq5) to resolve any problems with your files.
