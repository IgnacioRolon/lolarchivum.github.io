However, I guess the system does not understand the difference between valid reports and false reports well enough and considers reports worthy of consideration regardless of merit. \n\nOur comp. was awful and our players were not working together at all in the game or in the lobby to alleviate the issues. They basically had the attitude of &quot;I don&#039;t care... I do what I want and the team can pay for it. Everyone can be thrown under the bus if I have my fun.&quot; When I stated my opinion about the comp., I got flamed hard, called autistic, and was met with profanities. I was firmly under the impression that I cannot be punished merely for expressing another point of view and in this case, I don&#039;t think it was even really a matter of opinion. Our comp. actually was awful when judged coldly. I&#039;m not here to be a team cheerleader and to promote false delusions. I will be HONEST. As far as I&#039;m concerned, this moves past reducing harassment and bullying straight into thought control. In fact, I was the one actually being bullied here (all chat calls for reports etc.) just because I didn&#039;t say everything was sunshine and roses when it clearly was not. It was entirely within our power to never find ourselves in such a situation. The game was just automatically reviewed and I got the penalty seconds after it ended so clearly no human read the log to actually understand anything. The game I&#039;m discussing is game 1.\n\nHere are the glorious chat logs of the worst offenses Riot&#039;s bots could find due to reports:\n\n*I apologize for the awful typos but I only typed while moving or dead so I&#039;m not focusing on such things. Also, keep in mind that you have no idea about what I&#039;m actually responding to and nothing is said in a vacuum randomly. The most I see is me vehemently disagreeing with certain team decisions. I&#039;m not just going off on someone out of the blue or even criticizing them personally. It&#039;s all about the decisions. \n\nGame 1\nme: best mias NA\nme: not that it matters\nme: this game is compositionally lost after the zed pick regardless\nme: it&#039;s going to miss  a large percentage fo time at that range\nme: that&#039;s how hes balanced\nme: anyway idaf, this was lost at champ select\nme: basically unless we go 10-0\nme: no point getting mad when it&#039;s clear you guys had no desire to win anyway\nme: i&#039;m not even slightyl tilted\nme: the comp is just not viable at all\nme: the zed pick autoloses the game\nme: especially witha t ank top\nme: why? am i wrong?\nme: it&#039;s just logic\nme: can&#039;t get me banned for stating a well supported opinion\nme: i didn&#039;t insult anyone or anything\nme: i stated the comp is unviable\nme: and autoloses without a massive lead\nme: no it&#039;s not\nme: because it&#039;s not an attidude\nme: its&#039;a r ealtiy\nme: it&#039;s not random negative comment\nme: that&#039;s like saying it&#039;s raining

if you find talking annoying, don&#039;t read it or don&#039;t respond to it\nme: you&#039;re right, it doesn&#039;t take much but it does still take something which actually is valid\nme: criticizinga  comp and offering explanations is not\nme: no, because i&#039;m not complaining about others talking\nme: i&#039;m not the one who said it was annoying\nme: read\nme: trist did\nme: trist is someone\nme: you can make false reports but criticizng a comp and not agreeing with you isn&#039;t among the options\nme: and i&#039;m sure even you realize that\nme: i don&#039;t have to say

yeah i did but i didn&#039;t die to him, I died due to rotations\nme: and the bot rotationw asnt pigned\nme: yes i invaded but their lane was MIA\nme: i had no issue fighting lee sin\nme: zed, there is absolutely no merit to anyt\nme: so i think you realize it\nme: yes i do\nme: someone stating a comp isn&#039;t viable... explaining why... no AP mid, almost no cc, ,malp hard countering our 3

over 60% winrate in diamond1 +\nme: he&#039;s straight busted\nme: you can even be bad and still easily get diamond\nme: don&#039;t you feel bad about abusing such a broken freelon champion?\nme: 57% average winrate and 60%+ in diamond 1.... disgusting broken pos\nme: you&#039;re COMPLETELY WRONG and every metric proves it not just pro play\nme: he&#039;s actualyl BY FAR THE MOST BROKEN CHAMPION IN THE GAME NOT JUST JUNGLER\nme: YEAH IGNORE ALL STATS LMAO\nme: ivern is completley busted\nme: by every metric ther is  at every level\nme: just because he doesnt have huge damage doesn&#039;t mean he isn&#039;t god tier and utterly disgustingly unfairly busted\nme: look at thes tats if you odnt blieve\nme: o\nme: Im not just randomly saying this\nme: no\nme: I HATE PLAYING HIM, yes hes freelo high plat/d5 no matter how bad you are\nme: but i hate his playstayle\nme: is houdlnt be froced to play a champion just because he overshadows almost he entire roster\nme: that&#039;s NOT TRUE AT ALL there are many unpopular jgs with nowhere near tha twinrate\nme: it is NOT about playrate\nme: at all\nme: and 5% isn&#039;t that small\nme: hes just straight fn busted and even pro players say it\nme: not just stats\nme: you just dont realize it becuase his damage is low\nme: but his kit as a whole is fn absurd\nme: he&#039;s a nunu janna god tier child\nme: yeah im titled because it&#039;s unfair\nme: it&#039;s actually unfair for a champion witha  5% playrate to have a 57% average winrate even in plat+\nme: and for experienced players, 61% in diamond 1 +\nme: it&#039;s straight bs\nme: absolutely insane\nme: compeltely fn busted\nme: not even graves does that\nme: or shaco\nme: i am right\nme: go look at the fn stats\nme: go look at similar playrate jgs\nme: you wont finda  single one witht aht performance\nme: you say hes not busted but ahve zero evidence for it\nme: i am right\nme: go look at the evidence\nme: isntead of insiting on your incorrect assertiosn\nme: ok? good

didnt steal anyhting\nme: i created that kill\nme: i ulted her and did most of the damge to her\nme: it&#039;s absurd how Riot allows Ivern in his state just because people don&#039;t complain as much about him since he&#039;s not a 100-0 champ like Rengar\nme: no\nme: statsiticaly shes not\nme: after the nerfs\nme: it just ameks sense\nme: her kit has big strengthsd\nme: but also big weaknessees\nme: go look at poppys winrate\nme: its 48%\nme: even in diamond+\nme: experienced players get higher but not anyhting crazy\nme: dravens trying\nme: i never trolled... this tf can&#039;t have a discussion without getting mad\nme: i said ivern is busted, provided evidence\nme: and tf instead spouts profanities at me and isnults me\nme: hardly... can&#039;t have a good game with such huge imbalance in champions\nme: if you were playing something that wasn&#039;t graves, shaco or ivern, i&#039;d say gg\nme: but this is as good as legalized cheating\n\nGame 3\nme: red start lee,

game\nme: lol galio\nme: i am right\nme: 100%\nme: those decisions aren&#039;t exactly related to my play\nme: because it&#039;sn not something i can stop\nme: and the game is over\nme: as well\nme: it was not over at infernal\nme: and many similar places\nme: for example, i gank bot, get exhausted, you guys go through the wave while lees bot\nme: i died a lot due to focus or ambushes, but i consider these chases 10x worse\nme: yeah i never said i was going to go tnak\nme: except i wasnt\nme: and i got exhausted because i wasnt\nme: this is way stronger in ganks\nme: bette rpesron?\nme: nothign to do wth it\n\nBTW: This happened on a different account ranked Platinum 4 but I&#039;d rather keep it anonymous. My intention here isn&#039;t to remove the chat restriction or get anything from anyone. I&#039;m here to highlight a blatant flaw with the system - which is clearly way too reliant on report frequency rather than validity. I don&#039;t think any of my games here were that out of line for a heated competition. \n\nAgain, these aren&#039;t even the norm. These are the few games Riot could find which triggered reports. Two of which were mostly because I strongly maintained an opinion. The first was because I said our comp. wasn&#039;t viable and pretty much autoloses without snowballing. The second was me stating that Ivern is overpowered while someone on my team disagreed with me and basically called me an idiot to suggest Ivern was over the top. The last game was just strong disagreement with some team decisions. I'm not responsible for people's emotional problems and their inability to handle a competitive game with criticism.","replies":[{"poster":"NineTailedMystic","date":"2017-03-10T06:01:06.796+0000","up_votes":29,"down_votes":4,"body":"Sounds like overall severe negativity and some choice words in Game 2, not \"because I merely stated our comp was unviable\".","replies":[{"poster":"zecastar","date":"2017-03-10T06:34:34.432+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":6,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=NineTailedMystic,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=JEOAcgnt,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2017-03-10T06:01:06.796+0000)\n>\n> Sounds like overall severe negativity and some choice words in Game 2, not &quot;because I merely stated our comp was unviable&quot;.\n\nThere's obvious frustration but it doesn't seem that bad (especially for games supposedly selected for toxicity). I know my behavior could have been better but having room for improvement doesn't mean you actually cross the line into meriting punishments for toxicity. It's also not as if every comment has to be positive or constructive in order for it to not be considered toxic. I don't have to filter everything and I don't recall being paid to become the team cheerleader. I am only myself. My only responsibility as I see it is to not personally attack/harass/insult others and to keep it about the game. We should strive for more but it's just a bonus.\n\nHere's my Riot support message btw:\n\n> With no previous warning, I receive a chat restriction immediately after a game in which I criticized the comp. This was clearly not read by a human but was instead triggered by at least two very vocal players who were calling for reports on me. This is not justified unless I am actually not allowed to express any opinion except what people want to hear. There was no insult, no harassment, no profanity etc.\n> \n> The other linked games are similar and mostly about tactical disagreements or opinions on champions (Ivern). I understand that toxicity is a problem but this is not a fair assessment because occassionally disagreeing with someone strongly isn't the same as being toxic. Toxicity is about retaliation, personal attacks, insults etc. not discussing whether Ivern is OP or whether a comp. is viable.\n> \n> I don't want vague notions about why I was punished. It's pretty obvious that even if I was near some sort of threshold for punishment, the evidence presented is not valid. I should not get moved from near a threshold to punishment based off false evidence. Likewise, if you were close to the illegal limit of alcohol while driving but then a cop pulls you over and injects you with more alcohol in order to arrest you, that would not be OK. You might have been close to the limit but using false evidence to get you over it is not ethical or logical. The triggering game is a textbook case of false reports at work.","replies":[{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2017-03-10T11:51:43.382+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"\n\nBut you were negative (attitude of giving up)  in all the games shown.\n\nFor you to be punished with \"negativity\" (which is a mild form for toxicity), it must happen over loooooootttttttttsssss of games.

How can you possibly suggest that those things were related? This wasn't even about a teammate not respecting MIAs. It was about a lack of MIAs. Stop roleplaying when Riot refuses to give context. The rest is similarly misinformed (saying I gave up for example) and yes, that game was compositionally lost. That's REALITY. Accusing someone of \"negative attitude\" for stating reality is silly. Also, they definitely DID NOT have a real desire to win if they picked in such a way since there was massive antisynergy and even the most basic aspects of a comp. were not met. It wasn't hard for the enemy team to hard counter them either. This was discussed in champ. select but no one cared. The team's actions support that assertion. It's not out of the blue.\n\nThese are not my standard chat logs but I don't think they merit any punishment. To me, that shows more an issue with the system and overly sensitive people who cannot handle any opinions besides positive and encouraging (regardless of what is logical or true). If I complain about Ivern, rightfully so as even the statistics show, that's not \"negative attitude\". That's just questioning game balance and offering support for your opinion. It's not even a slight on the team.\n\nNegative attitude is when you are very negative for NO REASON and with DISREGARD TO REALITY. For example, if it's a sunny day and you say that today seems terrible over and over, that would be negative attitude. If on the other hand, it's a blizzard and people's property is being destroyed, that statement becomes reality for the traditional definition of \"terrible.\" It is NOT negative attitude because it's just reflecting reality. Just because the statement might make someone feel the same, doesn't mean it is the same. However, it seems many are incapable or unwilling to understand this distinction. Likewise, if it's 2-25 with no turrets and inhibitors, the person saying \"let's ff we're not winning this\" isn't being negative. This is just the ACTUAL SITUATION you're in. The same goes if you went a full early game comp. and find yourself floundering at 40 minutes. Pointing that out isn't a matter of attitude as much as just how the game works. If you were struggling but had a late game comp. at 40 minutes, similar comments would be negative attitude since the onus is on the enemy team to prove a win before they get outscaled. Your chances may be decent even if you're very behind.\n\nWith how vague and arbitrary the ToS is as well as how it seems people report purely off emotion, this whole system should probably be thrown in the garbage. It is not ethical or fair. It's only based off what people feel and everything is left to interpretation. If it makes them mad that you say a game is \"compositionally lost\" after a certain pick, it doesn't matter whether you have good reasons for the statement or not. They don't want to read that so they report you for it and not only is there no punishment issued to them, but they are encouraged based on the community group think. I don't care if others agree with me or not but it doesn't make any sense. You just can't express a negative opinion without retaliation even if it's correct or at least well justified. They pretend that your attitude is negative for not being delusional like them. It's pathetic. \n\n_______________________________________________________\nBTW: The idea that typing \"reported for afk\" is itself \"verbal abuse\" is beyond ridiculous. Do you know what verbal abuse actually means? What's next? Is a handshake assault? If someone is stealing from your fridge and you call him a thief, is that verbal abuse too? I would much rather have people verbally abuse me all than deal with this level of moderated nonsense and arbitrary censorship for opinions contrary to the group. This system is awful and unfair but Riot will just do what the majority want because it is their customer base so I don't blame them. I blame the people who complained enough to motivate Riot to implement something this stifling and draconian. I'm all for punishing people who harass others, vomit profanities, tell people to do/get awful things etc. However, the system has clearly expanded to punishing things which are VERY far from this extreme and border more on disagreement or personal dislike/annoyance than anything else. Everything is allowed unless people report you and if they do, nothing is allowed. :)","replies":[{"poster":"Sp33d Zer0","date":"2017-03-11T05:32:31.853+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just want to make sure, you are actually blaming ME for riot's stance on what is, and is not harassment in their game.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"SirPurrr","date":"2017-03-10T05:52:40.100+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":6,"body":"I guess you have to just avoid talking in the future unless it's a compliment.

Far from it and in fact, I play no very popular champions but this has no bearing on what's discussed. Even if someone was a \"meta slave\" or whatever derogatory term you want to use for someone who follows the game and tries to play strong picks, I don't think that's against any rule.

It's actually the opposite! Zed created a full AD comp. vs a Malphite and was also not in a good lane matchup. This isn't about picking the top 10 champions per role. It's about having a VIABLE comp.

Enjoy the punishment, man.\n\nI never called him stupid but it was definitely a stupid choice in that situation. It isn't about Zed as a champion. I'm not sure why this is hard for you to understand. The strength of a champion isn't linear and applicable to every comp. I have NO PROBLEM with Zed and he'd be perfectly fine with any AP top or even a tank top who does magic damage. Zed is obviously viable as a champion but that doesn't make him viable in all comps. You're arguing a point that was never claimed.\n\nI did misread your post about Zed. I lost patience after your first attempts to troll and make up random situations with huge mischaracterizations. \n\nAs far as my WW, you're not refuting anything. I know what I build. Just having Bloodrazor doesn't suddenly make you squishy when you have other items too and lifesteal as well as your E. We were also not losing because of a lack of tank. \n\nNo one was harassed. Criticizing the comp. isn't the same as harassing an individual. For example, Zed can be a stupid pick. That doesn't mean I'm calling the player stupid. Not hard. I don't know why I'm responding to an obvious troll though.","replies":[{"poster":"EvilDustMan","date":"2017-03-10T12:06:44.716+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=zecastar,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=JEOAcgnt,comment-id=0014000000000000,timestamp=2017-03-10T11:55:06.428+0000)\n>\n> I never called him stupid but it was definitely a stupid choice in that situation.

I might not like your opinions about certain things either and may find them useless but I won't try to censor you (except possibly for myself by muting). I won't even report someone for saying \"that's a retarded play/build/pick etc.\" but I will potentially report for \"you're a retard\". One is about the game and quality of decisions while the other extends to the person. neither is nice but as far as I see it, you can say anything as long as it's pertinent to the decisions made for that game rather than an individual's merit as a human being.","replies":[{"poster":"EvilDustMan","date":"2017-03-10T12:53:14.646+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=zecastar,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=JEOAcgnt,comment-id=001400000000000000000000,timestamp=2017-03-10T12:32:04.526+0000)\n>\n> I can see that but I have a right to say it if I wish.

Are you suggesting thought control is OK? If it's annoying, they can mute but believe me, I wouldn't have that much chat without others participating. As long as I don't resort to personal insults etc., it's within my right. \n\nIf someone spammed \"we got this!\" that would be equally unenlightened and without any useful constructive information. However, I doubt such a person would be raged at for \"spamming\" or providing no \"useful\" comment. Yet somehow because it's a positive statement you don't seem to submit it to the same standard. Both have just as much of a right to exist as long as they are within the abstract realm rather than personal attacks.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
