No, the ult just straight up deals magic damage, it doesn't convert anything. Hydra isn't an ability, so it doesn't apply Expose Weakness (if I recall correctly). WW doesn't attack during ult, he deals damage by applying 9 ticks of damage and 3 on-hits, with only the ult damage itself healing him and not the on-hits.","replies":[{"poster":"zecastar","date":"2017-03-24T11:17:07.571+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=IronwallJackson,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=bfah8HfF,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-03-24T11:06:38.450+0000)\n>\n> &quot;Does the Hydra **on-hit** AoE apply 3x during his ult too?&quot;  Yes, it applies just like every other on-hit effects.

Hydra's just a bit weird to me since it has an AoE on-hit but I guess that makes sense. For stuff like this, Riot sometimes has weird rules where they aren't just what's written. Hell, I'm still surprised Corki can't use Runaan's bolts for his magic damage autos.\n\nAs far as Expose Weakness, the tooltip does NOT say it has to be an ability. However, I know it did at ONE point and that's why I'm not sure how it really works now.","replies":[{"poster":"IronwallJackson","date":"2017-03-24T11:37:00.065+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, Expose Weakness specifically procs off of ability damage, far as I know.","replies":[{"poster":"zecastar","date":"2017-03-24T15:10:22.053+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=IronwallJackson,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=bfah8HfF,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2017-03-24T11:37:00.065+0000)\n>\n> Yeah, Expose Weakness specifically procs off of ability damage, far as I know.\n\nOn a related note, do you know if Q actually heals from on-hits as well? For example, would the 4% from Bloodrazor count as damage dealt in the context of its healing?","replies":[{"poster":"IronwallJackson","date":"2017-03-24T23:59:49.554+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sadly, I don't know, but then the practice tool could easily be used to test that, I reckon.","replies":[{"poster":"zecastar","date":"2017-03-25T02:16:47.210+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=IronwallJackson,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=bfah8HfF,comment-id=00000000000000000000,timestamp=2017-03-24T23:59:49.554+0000)\n>\n> Sadly, I don&#x27;t know, but then the practice tool could easily be used to test that, I reckon.\n\nNot so. I've tested everything else but I need a human to test if EW works or not. I can't assign an allied bot to attack something. I also can't easily find if other procs/on-hits apply to ult. or Q healing. I have found through the practice tool that Hydra's AoE does apply through the ult. though.","replies":[{"poster":"IronwallJackson","date":"2017-03-25T03:34:42.479+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have you tried getting your health lower by standing in an enemy fountain for a bit and comparing health regained before/after getting an on-hit item?","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Meep Man","date":"2017-03-24T15:11:09.712+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, it is applied 3 times and Warwick heals for all the damage it deals.

I've seen reports both ways about this.","replies":[]}]}]}
