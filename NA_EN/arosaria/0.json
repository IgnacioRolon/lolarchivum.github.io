As much as it doesn&#039;t stop me enjoying the game, it does get on my nerves. Does anyone know a way to fix this?","replies":[{"poster":"Jinxsterr","date":"2018-12-21T15:52:41.055+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Here is a little information that I had to learn the hard way. \n\nYour game is running at 200-250, but you are not actually viewing it in 200-250 fps. You're monitors hz limits the FPS you can see.  That being said, if you're monitor is 60hz , like most peoples, you are only viewing 60 fps because the maximum times your monitor can refresh is 60. So you need to go into options and cap your frame rate to 60-65 fps. If you have a 75hz monitor then cap it at 75-80. If you have a 144hz monitor then cap it 144-150. \n\nYour computer is processing 200-250 fps but your monitor is only capable of projecting a fraction of that, so you are effectively burning out your video card. \n\nWhen i purchased my Gaming Computer with i7 and gtx 1070 , LoL was running at 500-600 fps, I thought it was awesome, but I felt like it did not seem any different from the 50-60 fps I used to get on my old potato . And I was still having stuttering and it was very underwhelming. That is when I learned about my monitors refresh rate was only 60hz, so I was burning up my video card so fast with no actual change in visual fidelity.\n\nTHEN I learned about Screen Tearing. Screen tearing is present unless you have a gaming monitor that uses Display Port instead of HDMI, and has G-Sync or FreeSync capabilities. Display Port is a \"newer version of HDMI\" which transfers over 10 times the amount of data per second then HDMI. It is a must have for anyone who buys a computer for gaming.\n\nSo I went out and bought a 144hz G-Sync monitor which came with a Display Port and HDMI (You only use one of those though.) I used the Display Port, capped my frame rate at 150 fps, and now my game is , and I am not exaggerating , PERFECT, it runs at 145-150 fps with no screen tearing, no input lag, and because of this my Game Skill has been dramatically increased. \n\nContrary to what some believe you CAN use FreeSync with nvidia cards, you just don't have some of the capabilities G-Sync has, but still eliminates Screen Tearing and is much cheaper then a monitor with G-Sync.  For example , My son plays on a $150 FreeSync 27 inch Dell monitor with 75hz refresh rate and uses Display Port on a GTX 960 and he has ZERO Screen tearing/stuttering.  Where as My G-Sync 27 inch Asus monitor cost $750.\n\nTo sum it up, Cap your frame rate to whatever hz your monitor is and as for the screen tearing, you need a Free Sync or G-Sync monitor and use the Display Port and move away from the HDMI . After that , you will be amazed at how awesome PC gaming can really be. For example I have become so spoiled with my 145 fps with zero screen tearing  that console gaming with its 30 - 60 fps  looks like garbage to me.\n\nHappy Gaming.\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-12-21T00:09:43.075+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> my fps is usually about 200-250\n\nCap it, that is just going to cause tearing and higher temperatures.\n\nThe \"stutter\" is packet loss or ping spikes, nothing to do with your performance, and not stutter at all.\n\nAlso, i am profoundly sorry that you bought a 7500 in 2018, and hope it gives you much use before you realize how badly you got ripped off.","replies":[]}]}
