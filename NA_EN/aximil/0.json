Shortly after it forcibly shut down the instance I had up. Afterward it downgraded my game to the previous version without warning. I've been trying to log back onto the client for almost half an hour now and it just keeps saying it fails and to try again.\n\nAny help would be appreciated.\n\nEDIT: Apparently it's fixed. But I log back in and get a Leaverbuster warning.
