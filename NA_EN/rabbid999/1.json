At 40%, the patcher is in the processing of downloading files, but connection issues with your network can result in that error.  With permissions issues potentially fixed, we can work on making sure your connection is in order.  If you receive an error again, go over our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide for some troubleshoot steps.
