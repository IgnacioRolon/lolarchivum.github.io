However after thinking about it, I knew I had put too much time into the game and chose not to sell it. (At the time I had no idea that selling a LoL was against the terms of service). The people I wanted to sell my account to back then were MMOARMORY.com. They told me to change the username and password of my League of Legends account so I did. However after I did, I realized that I no longer wanted to sell the account because of how much it meant to me and created a support ticket to riot explaining this. Instead of helping me, they thought I sold the League of Legends account (which I did not) and Permanently banned it. (I didn't even notice this until a few days ago, trying to login to see all the changes that have been implemented during my time away from the game. So I didn't actually go against the terms of service because I never actually sold my account, I thought about it but changed my mind. So I have made a support ticket to riot and they haven't answered back to me. Hopefully I can receive a response faster from here and a Red riot member can help me with my situation. I've been playing League of Legends since the very beginning of season 2, have thousands of hours on record, was gold in season 3, diamond in season 5.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-07T21:27:38.836+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately, we rarely dive into account-specific information, since it's pretty sensitive information, especially around suspensions. I recommend you remain patient while an account specialist gets back to you regarding your suspension.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[{"poster":"Scrublord Nito","date":"2016-09-14T03:35:40.513+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My account has been un perma-banned :D","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Demonheim","date":"2016-09-10T12:36:00.540+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"dumb.","replies":[{"poster":"Scrublord Nito","date":"2016-09-15T19:20:21.613+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It actually worked out for me and I was able to get my account back.
