Even if they did, there would still be trolls. It's not really something you can get rid of in any game. There's always an opportunity to troll. Though, in my opinion, they could and should try a little harder. I think they've done enough on the toxicity front, and it's time to focus on trolls and griefers.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2017-09-28T01:46:55.183+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i truly do doubt you getting 4 different people running it down mid 4 games in a row.\n\nMaybe they just suck.","replies":[{"poster":"DaedalusWeaver","date":"2017-09-28T07:37:19.253+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Running it down mid isn't the only way to troll bud","replies":[{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2017-09-28T11:12:36.396+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"True. \n\nBut I'll say ahead of time, off-META picks, builds and strategies are not trolling.

League is a free game, and there's no incentive to be nice to people in this game, but there IS great incentive (and a lot of it too) to be a jerk to everyone, especially since it's competitive.
