She loses the movespeed buff on respawn, but has all of the Valor-form abilities and Valor&#039;s attack range. When her ult is off cooldown, it lists itself as the reactivation portion, but does nothing and doesn&#039;t revert. Her Harrier passive is still active in this state. Basically, the stuff you lose that Valor normally has means you&#039;re completely screwed.\r\n\r\nSteps to repeat:\r\n1) Yorick ults Quinn\r\n2) Quinn &quot;dies&quot;\r\n3) Quinn comes back because of Yorick ult\r\n4) Quinn ults\r\n5) Quinn is now perma-bird","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-10-12T18:38:52.558+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hiya Thrackerzod,\n\nThank you for the report! ^-^ We're aware of this issue and are working to resolve it!","replies":[{"poster":"TerraRising","date":"2015-10-12T20:24:14.873+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot KateyKhaos,realm=NA,application-id=LqLKtMpN,discussion-id=qaFUeaks,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-10-12T18:38:52.558+0000)\n>\n> Hiya Thrackerzod,\n> \n> Thank you for the report! ^-^ We're aware of this issue and are working to resolve it!\n\nIs there a similar issue with Nidalee, Elise or any other multiple-form champs?
