I also like the community and I've made a lot of friends through League over the years. However, there are, of course, a few toxic individuals that make some matches unpleasant. Fortunately, there is an option in-game to mute such players. \r\n\r\nHowever, that does not address the underlying issues. Misogynistic behavior for the most part goes unpunished so there is no incentive for sexist players to stop their toxicity. They are pretty much free to harass and verbally abuse female players with no repercussions. I understand that it may be harder to detect sexism than it is to detect racism or homophobia, but it's not impossible. Sexism is hate speech just as much as racism and homophobia are and it should be punished to the same extent.\r\n\r\nOf course I understand that the system will likely never be perfect, and there will always be hateful people working their way around the system, but all I'm requesting is that at least some effort is being made to address the rampant hatred towards women that is just tolerated by the community and Riot Games. And **please do not refer us to the reporting system, because in the case of sexism, it absolutely does not work.**\r\n\r\nThe issue has been ignored for years.

Literally unless the reported player flames in like 4 games in a row and gets reported they never get punished. Either way i dont believe chat should ever be report able, in my opinion the only thing that should be report able is game play. We have mute buttons for a reason if someone is being a toxic asshole in chat just mute them but we cant mute someone running down a lane and inting it or trolling.

I don't think riot needs to add anything else to there system about this issue.

You dont have to accept there friend request either, you are given plenty of options to avoid people who are like that.\n\nNot to mention currently, riot cares about its whole fanbase and players (hence the expirement they are wanting to conduct about perma'd accounts and the boards being up.) Riot doesn't reply as much on the boards because they know this seasons been a flop and are working on a fix for it. (atleast thats how i saw it).

I understand that being flamed is really shitty, because frankly we have all been there. I've seen other people with feminine usernames be harassed, whether its because they were a girl or because they were feeding I don't really know. The problem I'm seeing with this is that people will only really be flamed if another player thinks they are doing bad, that's not to excuse any type of harassment, but to give causation to it. \n\nPeople might be using specific words to flame people with feminine usernames because they know it will bother them, whereas if the person has a non-feminine username they default to the regular toxic word choices. The game is toxic in its very design, where other players can easily determine your rank as a player, where people will flame because they have a different idea of how to play the game, where 5 people with different strategies are forced together to try and win.

If someone is under performing and gets flamed, its just considered toxicity, but if they happen to be a female or minority does it instantly become hate speech? Its what happens in this grey area that bothers me when it comes to this issue. \n\nBack to word choices. A lot of general toxicity uses words that devalue other groups of people. They don't actively go out and call those groups by their slurs, and many of them have no biases against those groups, but they use the slur because its a powerful word and they want to bother someone who is ruining their game in their opinion. \n\nIDK the answer to this issue, Id rather have a system that doesn't word police at all than one that punishes people when they don't actually mean to offend certain groups of people, and they are just frustrated at the way someone is playing","replies":[]},{"poster":"Eternal Torment","date":"2018-08-06T03:04:26.056+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"While, yes, I agree with the general message you are trying to appeal here, There is one thing that needs to be debunked ASAP. The word Mysogyni. Flaming in League of Legends more often than not does not come from a conscious or subconsciously rooted belief that the male is superior to a woman, it comes from trying to find something to pin the blame against.\nWomen on LoL for the most part receive flaming on the same level males do, the thing however is you should never play the \"i'm a woman\" card in any argument. Why? Because ANY argument that deranges from the topic, or incites a desperate measure of attempted self-defence (Which btw is bullshit because texting is not actual fighting, thus there is no self defence, there is only engaging offense) is just going to backfire on you miserably because you are showing people your wound spot and expect them to not harm it out of respect, but what actually happens is you ask for it and then are highly surprised it happened to begin with.\n\nWhen people want to piss of a woman out of any reason at all, they mostly refer to sexism as the tool of use because it works. It is effective at pissing people off. It is rarely, very rarely ever a case of actual mysogyni. \nThat, however, does not stop me from agreeing that the initial message here is \"Sexism needs to be addressed tighter\" to which I am ready to agree with. However, if that is to happen then the victims must also pay respect to every motive in the spectrum of action, not just the one that sounds the worst.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Frothy White Goo","date":"2018-08-06T00:02:49.836+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":12,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Big Tiddy Fox GF","date":"2018-08-06T01:02:23.395+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Let's just not mix up feminism and feminazis here, cuz I feel like you do and that you don't know what you're talking about, especially since that it isn't really argued well.\n\nAlso, everyone in the game should be treated well without any exception, I understand that harrasment can happens, but saying, for example, \"she's a girl and should play support\" or \"girls belongs to the kitchen\" seriously isn't okay.","replies":[{"poster":"TheKingOfBiches","date":"2018-08-06T02:30:54.283+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":6,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Djüsse,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=UnRU3BwI,comment-id=00120001,timestamp=2018-08-06T01:02:23.395+0000)\n>\n\n> \n> Also, everyone in the game should be treated well without any exception\n\nNo,you play a video game to have fun,not for people ~~to suck you off~~ and treat you well.","replies":[{"poster":"Big Tiddy Fox GF","date":"2018-08-06T02:49:10.757+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tell me, where did I exactly said that people should suck you off?\nRight, nowhere.
