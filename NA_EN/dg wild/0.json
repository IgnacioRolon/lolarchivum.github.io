I can use abilities but it doesnt show until after freezing. This happened in a ranked game and I went to test it in bots after restarting my PC.\r\n\r\nI also tried other online games to see if it was my net, but it wasn't. I also had a ping at around 38-45 while the freeze happened, as well as fine FPS.\r\n\r\nThe only thing I can think of doing is capping my FPS @ 60 might fix it, but I have yet to try that.","replies":[{"poster":"FF7Cloud","date":"2018-02-15T20:35:22.228+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have now the same problem as u had .\ndid u fix it ? \nif u did pls tell how is so anoying .","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-08T03:46:33.264+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is a primary symptom of *Packet Loss* or *High packet buffering*.
