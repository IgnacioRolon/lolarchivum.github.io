{"poster":"Iniquitee","date":"2016-02-18T18:59:07.531+0000","title":"Evolution of a Dragon Champion","subforum":"Dev Corner","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey folks,\n\nLate 2013, we gave a super early preview of an eastern-inspired, serpentine storm dragon named **Ao Shin** that was in the first phases of champion creation. Then, in the two years that passed (aside from a few comments in low-key conversations) we went silent. Totally a mistake on our part, and the mystery around this dragon has only increased over time. We’ve seen the question of “Ao Shin where?” pop up all over the place, including being one of the most asked questions in our recently hosted preseason Q&amp;A in China.\n\nNow that 2016 is upon us and production schedules are being finalized for early this year, we finally have an update: the dragon that we previewed in 2013 has evolved tremendously over time. As such, we will ***not*** be releasing the champion that you know as Ao Shin, but in the first half of this year we ***will*** be releasing a dragon champion. His name is (tentatively) Aurelion Sol.\n\nWe can’t say much more about Aurelion Sol, but we did want to share some of the challenges we faced and lessons we learned. While the major news is out of the bag, you can still read on if you want hear how the dragon formerly known as Ao Shin evolved over the course of two years.\n\nFirst: Ao Shin’s kit just didn't pass muster. This is a pretty common problem we run into in the initial stage of champion creation, and while sometimes we can adjust on the fly (a useable ‘paper kit’ might have two or three core abilities that make things click), other times we need to shelve the entire concept and take a step back. Internally, we call this ‘ice boxing’ a champion until we can revisit with a fresh perspective.\n\nSecond: delivering on the unique shape of a serpentine dragon’s body - long and powerful - in a game where instantaneous turning is key presents some unique technical challenges. Given enough time, we were confident we could solve the turning problem, but because Ao Shin’s abilities weren’t coming together we were reluctant to commit to engineering work that might just end up scrapped.\n\nFinally - and this was the big one - we committed too early to Ao Shin’s premise without really developing his thematic roots. Around the time we announced Ao Shin, we were in the process of slowing down our champion pipeline to figure out how to continue delivering resonant characters that feel unique to the League universe. We learned a lot during this time (still learning!) and when we examined Ao Shin with these new lessons - Why was he in Runeterra? What were his motivations? - we unearthed a fresh thematic that really set us off running. \n\nSo in the end, while we’re sorry to have hyped up the idea of a serpentine, storm-wielding dragon for so long, we’re still very excited to deliver a dragon champion this year that we hope you’ll love. Aurelion Sol’s got some big shoes (claws?) to fill, but we still like surprises so stay tuned - any of our next few champions could be him!","replies":[{"poster":"thewire666","date":"2016-02-18T19:09:50.770+0000","up_votes":726,"down_votes":33,"body":"Please make a skin for this champion: Definetly not Ao Shin.\n","replies":[{"poster":"Makuta Teridax","date":"2016-02-18T19:26:58.906+0000","up_votes":191,"down_votes":4,"body":"Or make a Ionian themed skin at release and call the skin simply Ao Shin.

The Storm Dragon.\nAurelion Sol's passive is \"Heating Up\". Aurelion Sol gains passive stacks on an enemy upon basic attacking them, and upon 3 hits, does a set percent of their health as crystal damage.\nNow, because Aurelion Sol is an agility hero, we made his kit revolve around going pretty fast.\nHis Q is \"Breathe Fire,\" where he is rooted in place and can breath flames in a continuous line for 3 seconds, doing extra DoT to any enemy hit.\nHis W is \"Spit Flames,\" where he shoots a ball of fire in a line that deals damage and slows in the target area. This ability is literally Galio's Q, Resolute Smite.\nHis E is \"Icy Wind,\" where he shoots a cone of rocks and debris in an area in front of him that travels forwards. Think Annie W, but it moves.\nHis ultimate is \"Revenant of Dragons' Past,\" where he flies up into the air and splits in to after a brief delay. Aurelion Sol is invulnerable during the channel of this ability. After the channel, him and his other half, Ao Shin, fall to the ground creating a shockwave in a medium-sized area, doing true damage. Ao Shin is controllable by holding Alt and right clicking. Upon casting an ability, both Aurelion Sol and Ao Shin use said ability, but Ao Shin's have slightly different effects. \"Breathe Fire\" slows rather than applying DoT. \"Spit Flames\" applies DoT rather than slows. \"Icy Wind\" does physical damage, and his passive does magical damage.\n\nThank you for tuning in to the Aurelion Sol champion spotlight. Please don't forget to subscribe to the Riot Games youtube channel, and to check out my mixtape at www.soundcloud.com/riotphreakout. I was inspired by this new champion to \"spit some flames\" of my own.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Bowblax","date":"2016-02-18T19:11:03.681+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":5,"body":"you should still call him Ao Shin because of how well known the name is in the league community and Aurelion Sol is harder to say and spell.","replies":[{"poster":"Vi and Cupcait","date":"2016-02-18T19:30:27.343+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'll be honest, I'm still gonna call him Ao Shin in game, or at least ASS","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ultra boosted","date":"2016-02-18T19:10:45.266+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":1,"body":"The name gives off a huge Roman vibe.
