I can say for now that it doesn't look like we would have IP banned you for any reason. Since this will involve some of your personal information, it'd be best to handle this in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new). Take a screenshot of the exact error and attach it to your ticket as well so we know exactly what we're dealing with!","replies":[{"poster":"DontGankMeISuck","date":"2017-04-24T05:41:13.939+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay I dont have a screenshot of it now.

If it's not working, I want to try to help with that too so that we can help you get this IP thing figured out. Is the ticket page giving you any kind of error, or why won't it let you submit a ticket?","replies":[{"poster":"DontGankMeISuck","date":"2017-04-24T20:44:12.959+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I understood what you meant.
