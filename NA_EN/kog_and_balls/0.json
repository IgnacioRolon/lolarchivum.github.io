I don&#039;t even know what identity Riot wants to push on Kog because it feels like he is trying to fill 3 different niches, but isn&#039;t top of the dog pile in any of them.  Vayne shreds tanks so much better than Kog, Jinx is the better late game carry and doesn&#039;t have her range modifier gated by a long cooldown, Corki brings a stronger magic damage influence to a team and overall better synergy with trinity force, and to top it all off they don&#039;t suffer from an absolute dog shit laning phase. \n\n500 base range means you get creep blocked half the time you want last hit without your W. Kog can&#039;t follow ganks well he can&#039;t run away from ganks well. He can&#039;t poke with his ult anymore. Every other adc has decent Ad scaling on every ability and Kog is a complete slave to attack speed. How does Riot look at Kog and say &quot;Yep this is fine everything is fine.&quot; \n\nWhat does Kog do that other adcs can&#039;t besides explode when he dies? Is that the niche Riot wants him to fill shittiest passive on a Marksman? Clearly not because Kalista has him beat in that regard as well.\n\nEdit: A common thing Im hearing is \"OMG dat late game doe, but only if you are on a team with 4 supports who buff you constantly wipe your ass and hold your hand\" and that argument really just goes for all marksmen. Teams should peel for their carries and amplify their damage when able. Kog is just special in that he gets dusted by a stiff breeze if you aren't protecting him.

His ult could also use some reworking to make it fit the fantasy too.\n\nI'm in agreement there.\n\nI've got a two pronged concept for the 'dissolving' side of things.  First, Kog gets a new Passive that applies stacks of flat resistance shred to targets when Kog hits them with basic attacks.  I used to run a magic resist shredding Kog back when his Q did flat shred and the result tended to be pretty hilarious.  He could knock soft targets down into negative resist and absolutely annihilate them.\n\nThe second portion would be Kog's Q.  Kog's Q would have its cooldown decreased considerably and it would no longer shred any resist.  Instead, it could place a debuff on targets hit that converts Kog's passive stacks from flat shred to multiplicative percentile shred stacks.  Each stack would be counted separately and if the percentile value is less than the flat value, the flat value is used instead.  Basically, Kog's passive would be the minimum shred caused by each stack.\n\nNow for the BIG idea.\n\nKog's Ult?  Each level in it causes Kog to transform ala Kha'zix.  Kog grows up through the game, becoming bigger and more ferocious looking until you've got a real end-game monster.  It would fit SO PERFECTLY with Kog's fantasy of being this cute little Void caterpillar that grows up into an unstoppable horror by late game.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Kog And Balls","date":"2016-09-30T03:34:11.345+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Would certainly help to set him apart.
