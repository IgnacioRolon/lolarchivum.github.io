It stays at a screen that says reconnect. I click on it. Boom. Nothing. Nothing. And, then again. Nothing. What the hell, man? And, to make it worse, I am now having to eat 25 minute wait times for something out of my control. Sheesh.  I guess I will play some Heroes of The Storm. I can still access their client. Hint.

No testing can be done on account that the reconnect issue occurs when no game actually is available to play. I only ever get into the champ loading screen. After that, the screen goes directly to a reconnect. Therefore, if I can not play an actual game, how the hell am I supposed to test a game?","replies":[]},{"poster":"greenlightgo22","date":"2017-11-10T01:50:59.839+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Just removed/uninstalled league from my computer. And, reinstalled. A repairing status began to show. After this completed, there was a error message with a bunch of code type stuff. So, this is not an internet issue. This is a you and riot issue. And honestly, I have been reading through the many pages in help and support. Your support team is completely incompetent. This is a fun game when able to play, but my lord, you guys need to realize that if you are looking to make money turning away your players is not a good start. You catch more flies with honey than vinegar. Treat the community kindly and we'll repay you with our money and time. Treat us poorly and we will do as an other consumer does, we'll take our time and money elsewhere.","replies":[]},{"poster":"greenlightgo22","date":"2017-11-10T01:00:49.297+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Dude, sounds like you need to pay closer attention to your customer and player base and not point everything at us all the time. Sometimes, the crap really is being slung from you, your fellow employees, and the rest of RIOT. My connection is fine. I read articles about fossilized dino poop and browse through various different cooking recipes.  First off, with your skill level and aptitude of being a paid puppet, you could probably make more money slinging bags of bull diddly as a car salesman.  Second,  you obviously do not lack the ability to read or write as your grammar is impeccable. Therefore, I think you are just managing to do a good job to annoy not just myself but others swimming in this cesspool you call a support system. Make sure you take a look at this post and the obvious others that are being sprung onto the board like weeds and then tell me it is my fault and my connection!!!!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-09T23:59:38.476+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Sounds like your network is losing it's connection with our servers if the \"reconnect\" button is popping up. First off, if you know this is happening I'd suggest staying away from matchmade matches since you know you can get those leaverbusters for leaving too much for any reason. Second, my first step would be updating your port forwarding and DNS settings to make sure you can keep a solid connection (hit up our [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) if you aren't sure how to adjust those settings). \n\nMake sure you test those changes in a practice or custom game to avoid longer LPQ's!","replies":[]}]}
