I&#039;m constantly finding myself frustrated at how blind we are to how the ranked and matchmaking systems work, and I feel like it would be better if we could at least get some kind of meaningful information that explains why we are getting the LP +/- that we are, when we are about to get demoted, immunity grace periods, etc.\r\n\r\nI know that the information is out there, but it&#039;s not applied to the player&#039;s account in any way that I can tell.  For example, I think you get demoted at 1 loss at 0LP, but only after playing three games at that division, for starters.  But I don&#039;t have a way to know how many games I&#039;ve played in my current division, and additionally, this information isn&#039;t even available in the client to a player that doesn&#039;t frequent the forums or reddit.","replies":[{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2017-07-25T14:54:45.632+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is an indicator, it's called noticing that you're at 0 Lp and have been losing.\n\nI'm curious, what difference would it make if you knew?","replies":[{"poster":"SaveToTheADrive","date":"2017-07-28T23:32:45.445+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Feeding Rakan,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=eJbtebJZ,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-07-25T14:54:45.632+0000)\n>\n> There is an indicator, it&#x27;s called noticing that you&#x27;re at 0 Lp and have been losing.\n> \n> I&#x27;m curious, what difference would it make if you knew?\n\nIt's important to have an explanation in the client because the rules for demotion change from situation to situation.\n\nDemotion rules are different when considering losing a division, losing a tier, LP decay, and on top of all that these rules can be different depending on what division you are.","replies":[]}]}]}
