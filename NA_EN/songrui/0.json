I will solve it from time to time, but the solutions are rather inconsistent. For example, one time I will repatch the latest patch and it seems to fix the problem. The next time this would happen, I would be required to reconfigure my DNS address, following the steps found on the \"Login Issues\" website. (I have tried all of them, the only one that seems to work on occasion is the DNS configure). This \"Glitch\" or bug also happens through a variety of  circumstances, which all seemingly have the same type of origin/ problem, with connection issues or some sort of data transmitting problem. (I never make manual changes in my settings unless it's troubleshooting, so these connection issues happen legitimately randomly.) Examples of this are a complete black screen in the post-game screen, with a frozen client, or having no connection in champion select, de-synchronized with the server.  Happening randomly, this problem is extremely frustrating to deal with, from 10 minutes to hours at a time. I WANT TO PLAY LEAGUE D: \n\nAlso, restarting my laptop does seem to create this problem as well.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-03T22:49:00.583+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As *Zarsie* mentioned, this issue likely related to some instability in your connection to the servers.

I had no connection problems the entire week until friday night, where after my game, suddenly, the connection failed. I am, once again, unsure of what caused the problem, and until now have been working for hours trying to fix it. I've tried tarsie's suggestions, I've gone through every single suggestion on the troubleshooting page except for the netalyzer ones. Nothing seems to be working.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-09T16:09:14.781+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since the connection guide didn't immediately solve your issue, we'll need to take a closer look at your system and network to see what could be causing this issue. I recommend running a set of system logs with our [Hextech Tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367), then attaching those logs to a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).

Hit the start button and in the search bar type \"msconfig\" go ahead and click it when it shows up in the results area. Navigate to the services tab and select the \"hide all Microsoft services\" tick. After that is ticked un-tick all other programs. Next go to startup and do the same. Reboot. This fixed the issue for me.","replies":[]}]}
