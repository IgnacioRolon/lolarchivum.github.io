We play console and PC games, if you look at console communities they don&#039;t have much players that are from Europe and Asia. I would consider those regions PC focused, while in NA it&#039;s more console focus.

NA has a sizable player base both for PC and console games, it is just they are bad in any e-sport where other regions are interested in\nSmash Bros is probably the only competitive game that has had an estabilished competitve scene for long time where NA competes well (and Smash is far more popular in NA than in the other countries excewpt Japan, and JAPAn doesn't really have a developed esports scene), the other two games scenes have been kinda unstable, pumped basically by the game producers which are NA based, and the other regions have had far less interest spent on it in than NA","replies":[]},{"poster":"ReflectiveFly","date":"2016-02-25T21:57:54.586+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its more about attitude than PC or console , in Na tryharding is not a thing , people are trolling and seem to prioritize fun over hard work .
