This will continue until you reach a ranking more appropriate for your current level of skill.\n------------------------\nI'd recommend you stop playing ranked games until you have gained more experience and improved your gameplay.  \n\nYou don't even have full pages of Tier 3 runes yet, so you are starting most games with an immediate stat disadvantage.

Start building tank on Wukong if you fall behind. \n\nSupport Lee Sin is not good unless you are really good with Lee Sin. Don't do it.\n\nYou don't look to be that good with Teemo. Stop playing him top, he is very unforgiving if you fall behind.\n\nYou had no kills with Lux and 4 deaths and 0 assists but you completed meijis? \n\nMy guess is that you fall behind in lane and try to \"catch-up\" with a kill or gank. If this fails you are probably 2 deaths behind. At that point you are unlikely to catch up with your current skill.\n\nJust farm. Literally don't worry about kills, poke, what your jungler is doing, how the other lanes are going: just farm. Get items then try to team fight. You are Wukong, you can literally get 0 kills in lane and still be highly relevant in every teamfight.\n\nI would also recommend TP over ignite, because you need it to avoid missing CS. You clearly are not getting the kills to justify taking it.","replies":[{"poster":"TheDarkFighterz","date":"2016-07-21T01:39:59.585+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How'd you deduce all that?

Now that you mention it, farming is very important. I mostly took ignite to get kills, but for top lane it is bad, thank you for clarifying it. All-in-all, your analysis was great and gave me some skills I need to work on.\n\nI looked at you CS average per game, your summoners, and your deaths. Your CS per game is low, you take ignite instead of TP which means an early death puts your really behind, and your deaths per game are relatively high. \n\nI am a top lane main. I have idea when a player falls behind by looking at the stats and it is a LONG walk back to lane if you die early. Meaning you miss CS and XP. By the time you get back to lane after an early death you opposing laner may be one full level up on you and could easily kill you again.\n\nA lot of lower skill players focus on trading or attacking instead of farming. \n\nJust farm, avoid hits, and bring sustain to the lane. Learn to farm under tower (2 tower shot on melees then an auto and one auto-attack then turret shot then auto attack on casters).\n\nI really think if you just farm you will win more games. In your Elo if you focus on farming you will eventually be stronger than your opposing laner because they probably stink at farming. Just don't die and use your TP to get back to lane if you get low. \n\nAlmost never cross the river ever unless you have visual of the opposing jungler and mid-laner.\n\nI play {{champion:75}} so I learned really early to keep up in CS against my opposing laner. I also know my champion's early game sucks compared to most, so I have to be careful with early trading. Wukong is strong early so you can afford to trade if you want, just don't do it too much and make sure to last hit minions.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Calabok","date":"2016-07-21T02:19:01.687+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"also don't forget that sometime it is inevitable that you get bad team mates and lose badly. its random you know.","replies":[{"poster":"FioraWillCarry","date":"2016-07-21T02:37:46.261+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Calabok,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=nAKXFH8c,comment-id=000b,timestamp=2016-07-21T02:19:01.687+0000)\n>\n> also don&#x27;t forget that sometime it is inevitable that you get bad team mates and lose badly. its random you know.\n\nDid you see his match history ?
