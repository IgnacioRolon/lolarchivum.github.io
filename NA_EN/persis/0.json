You are annoying. You say stuff like \"mb guys I wasn't listening to the P1's advice\" as if the P1 is WAY under you. Its  a division. A single division. You aren't even a multi season diamond, this is literally your first season that  you hit it. The last 3 seasons you were Bronze - Silver - Gold... this season you just abused Ryze. That P1 ADC that you talked down to was Diamond  - High plat - mid plat. He has a lot more experience than you do as far as playing at a higher elo. Also, he was 20-5-9 while you were 1-10-5. When you are doing shitty you should listen to the team mate that is actually doing good. That guy was doing THE BEST on the team - he deserved to have his voice listened to. But you are one of those kiddos that abused something that is pretty broke to get into high elo which means you don't actually know how to play at a high level. You are playing a champ that can easily get to diamond but you are not a well rounded diamond player. Hopefully they nerf ryze a bit more so you never get up to this elo again and I don't have to risk having someone like you in my game; I hate being matched with uncarriable shitters that think they are good because they FINALLY hit Diamond.\n\nHopefully this is your wake up call.\n\n> Persis: ff lmao \n> Persis: u blind? \n> Persis: man this graves lmao \n> Persis: thresh go in base dont leabe \n> Persis: all u do is die and miss hooks \n> Persis: and u still havent landed a good hook \n> Persis: just stop getting caught \n> Persis: grp or ff \n> Persis: uve landed 1 hook all game shh \n> Persis: .ff \n> Persis: this ad and jg are useless oml \n> Persis: this has to be bronze \n> Persis: can u just ff pls \n> Persis: u guys are way to stupid to pull this off \n> Persis: i bet ull lose in 10 minutes without me \n> Persis: how can u do that when all u do is run top and die \n> Persis: cause idrc anymore \n> Persis: i gave up lol \n> Persis: u guys are way to heavy \n> Persis: ur 2/11  \n> Persis: reported \n> Persis: ur all bronze \n\n\n> Game 2 \n\n\n\n> Persis: thx for the help man \n> Persis: glad to see ur being very useful \n> Persis: is saying &amp;quot;kill urself&amp;quot; better? \n> Persis: idrc if i die im just lowering my gold value \n> Persis: thats what uve been doing? \n> Persis: omg panth bigest counter \n> Persis: omg \n> Persis: ya should probs listen to the plat 1 \n> Persis: me no care \n> Persis: mb guys i wasnt following the plat 1s advic \n> Persis: bronze 4 \n> Persis: thats why me must follow plat 1 \n> Persis: should i suicide too? \n> Persis: i did what u did masta \n> Persis: ya i just got caught","replies":[]},{"poster":"Paquay","date":"2017-02-17T06:07:13.594+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you have received a 14 day ban, then the question becomes \"is this punishment-worthy\".
