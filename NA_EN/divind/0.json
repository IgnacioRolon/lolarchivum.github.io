Our Bot laners were losing their lane really badly, within around 10 minutes enemy adc was 4 kills ahead and my bot lane was still pushing not letting me gank. Their Sejuani would gank them and cause them both to suffer hard. I very quickly gave up hope on bot and decided to help top and mid for a winning chance. The match lasted 27 minutes and our bot was 1/9/6 miss fortune and a 0/8/5 Braum. The enemy bot lane ended with 15/0/12 Caitlyn and 10/1/18 Morgana.\nThe rest of OUR team consisted of myself, 7/6/3, Jayce 5/7/7, and Darius 4/7/6, The three of us didn't approve of our bot lane and we suffered because of them, we lost the game.\n\nOfcourse, our bot lane (mainly just Braum) blamed me for not ganking them enough, even though I was never given the oppurtunity by them. For some reason Braum even blamed me for their deaths. His premade remained chilled, but our Braum was morally destructive. When clearing CS waves of mega minions, he decided to not take part and instead would Dance (Ctrl + 3). I was flamed by Braum for pretty much all game but me and the top and mid laner understand that our Braum was being irrational and causing our team to lose. \n\nRead the chat and let me know if this is a reasonable for a 10 in game chat restriction, which is quite severe when you're trying to give info as a jungler.\n\n**The Chat**\n\nPre-Game\nDiViND: dont ban rengar\nIn-Game\nDiViND: show that hippie who's boss         [Making a joke about Demacia Vice enemy Garen]\nDiViND: :o\nDiViND: or yasuo \"mains\" in our team        [Jayce telling me if I spam m7 I will get trolls next game, which I made a joke about]\nDiViND: who go 0/20\nDiViND: what was I gonna do?

I gave comments on our current situation. Things like \"bot is fucked\" was in fact a really poor situation. When they would ask why I wouldn't gank, I would tell them their score (as it was very early in the game) and I didn't want to explain to them that It's because they were giving off a lot of kills too early and I've given up on bot. I simply and briefly told them their scores, and told them I'm ganking not losing lanes.\n\nalso when I said \"1/9, 0/8\" premade botlane, they had already left the lobby, it was just me, jayce and darius left, I was telling them that we couldn't win when we have 2 premade players so far behind.","replies":[{"poster":"rujitra","date":"2019-07-23T02:37:33.875+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"So, it doesn't matter who started it - them blaming/insulting you doesn't give you the right to do it to them.

Although what I was intending was to copy what he had said and apply it to his case.\n\nSecond one, No, We had no turrets bot and there was no way we could get back from that, Why is that flaming/blaming? Who am I flaming in that case? \n\nThird one, Not insulting, They said \"Then Gank bot\" And I don't want to stop playing and message why Im not ganking them in detail, I showed them their scores, and I said \"im ganking non losing lanes\" as that was the only way I saw us in winning, even if I was wrong, I was answering them, not flaming them, don't take it out of context!\n\nFourth one, They said they were both Autofilled, I saidDiViND: bot you're premade, DiViND: I doubt BOTH of you were auto, DiViND: this guy is trolling, Braum said they were both auto, which I didn't buy, so I said he's trolling, is trolling an insult? \n\nFifth one, Again, is Trolling in an insult? is that flaming too? when he dances instead of helping the team and says they were both apparently autofilled. Not Accusations, you can download the match and watch him dance as we're trying to protect our turrets form mega minions.\n\n6th one, how is recalling events a form of insulting or flaming? I tried to outline their mistakes and explain why I didn't gank.\n\n7th one, I was talking to the enemy team and asking them to report our braum, they said \"for?\" and that I sound like im crying, I told them why, why is that a bad thing?\n\n8th one, this one is absurd, HOW is that harassment? I was reminding Darius and Jayce to report Braum, Not only was I specifically talking to Jayce and Darius, Braum had already left the lobby. It's like reporting a crime to the police and then being called out for harassing the culprit. \n\n9. Although I did blame bot lane for losing, you had taken this out of context again; DiViND: I hate when people say, \"stop blaming team, you're in that elo because you're skill\",  but it's like, how can we win a game like this? XD , 1/9 0/8 premade botlane , like.. how XD\".\n again, I was recalling events and how they were wrongly accusing me for inting the game.\n\nAlthough I will admit that I did blame bot for losing the game, I did argue, I did NOT insult them (unless recalling events and stating the current situation would somehow be insulting/flaming) and I did not flame them.\n\nTo my knowledge, Arguing is not a bannable offense, neither is putting the blame on someone. If it were the case, it would be absurd. I had encountered a game where me and a friend were put into a game with a duo who were running it down mid (literally since the the opening of the fountain gates) and then at minute 20 saying \"Guys don't surrender, we want to beat the record for most deaths) and then blaming them for losing the game is somehow a form of flaming, then the line of what's acceptable is completely blurred out, you can ban almost anyone in any game of LoL.\n\nFurthermore, Please stop taking my comments out of context to aid your counter-argument.","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-07-23T03:29:48.423+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=DiViND,realm=EUW,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=965hEBVk,comment-id=0000000000000000,timestamp=2019-07-23T02:59:38.307+0000)\n>\n> To my knowledge, Arguing is not a bannable offense, neither is putting the blame on someone.\n\nYour knowledge is incorrect. The vast majority of your chat consisted of harassing teammates for their poor performance. Did \"bot is fucked\" or \"your lane is a lost cause\" or \"this guy is trolling\" make those teammates play any better? No. This kind of thing not only makes people feel worse, it even makes them play worse.

It's technically possible for someone to literally be matched with the worst player on the planet, but there's no reason to spend the match calling them the worst player on the planet. It won't make them better at LoL, it won't make them feel better, and it won't help you win the match. All it will do is make them feel worse, annoy your team, and get you punished for breaking the rules, \"facts\" or not. It's technically true that 2+2=4, but if you announce that fact to your team every four seconds, that's spam and it will annoy them until they mute you, followed by a report and a punishment. It's a true fact, but spamming it is still punishable. Announcing a struggling teammate's score every time they die might be a recitation of fact, but all that does is harass the teammate by calling attention to their poor performance. It won't improve their performance; it might actually exacerbate the problem by tilting them. Scores are factual, but that doesn't make it okay to harass someone.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=DiViND,realm=EUW,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=965hEBVk,comment-id=000000000000000000010000,timestamp=2019-07-23T03:45:32.533+0000)\n>\n> I don't know what to say then if one our teammates isn't engaging and instead doing his own act.\n\nHow about _nothing_?\n\n> [{quoted}](name=DiViND,realm=EUW,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=965hEBVk,comment-id=000000000000000000010000,timestamp=2019-07-23T03:45:32.533+0000)\n>\n> I understand that it brings no good, but I tried to bring reasoning into this as well as re-tracing our mishaps.

You managed to wrongfully (or purposefully) interpret that as me blaming our botlane when I was talking about the lane itself.\n\nI will read the summoner's code once I get some rest, and I will get back to you.","replies":[{"poster":"rujitra","date":"2019-07-23T04:04:50.884+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I make no statement on your intent, or whether it was on purpose or not. You can have the best intent in the world and your actions in game may not have thrown the game - but your chat was against the rules. You got a 10 game chat restriction to warn you your behavior is venturing outside the realm of acceptable. I have explained to you why your chat was against the rules - you can either attempt to learn from this and improve your behavior in the future, or you will likely be coming back to this board with a 25 game chat restriction, a 14 day ban, or a permanent ban - which are the next steps if you continue to behave this way.\n\nIf you notice, I didn't actually include the line \"you're saying i'm inting...\" - because that line had constructive parts in it. And while I understand you were being nice to your teammates you perceived were doing well, that does not excuse your behavior towards the other players. Calling teammates out as \"useless\", in any way, is not acceptable. You are a team - including the \"useless\" player.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"OneMustFall","date":"2019-07-23T03:50:13.450+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You exhibited negative behavior throughout the game and technically broke the rules.

Some people are of the opinion that no chat should be punishable, and therefore any chat punishment is unfair; some people are of the opinion that insults and harassment are acceptable behavior, and therefore any punishment for insults or harassment is unfair; some people are of the opinion that inting once in a while is cool, and therefore any punishment for inting is unfair; and so on and so forth.\n\nAccording to Riot's rules of behavior which you agreed to and which serve as the basis for any punishments your account receives, however, this punishment was absolutely fair. I can guarantee you that sending in a ticket would be a waste of your time as well as Riot's. Their support agent(s) will repeat what most people here are telling you, confirm that your punishment was given correctly and therefore won't be lifted, and then close the ticket.","replies":[{"poster":"DiViND","date":"2019-07-23T03:53:36.085+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I understand that it was an opinion, and I, myself, believe it to be unfair, It wants me to be more helpful to my team and to set me in that order they punish me by making me mute, which kind of defeats the purpose, Although it achieves the goal of punishing flamers and toxic behaviours, it counter-acts the idea that we should be constructive, supportive and helpful to our teammates when we can't do that since we have a limited amount of messages which would be more wisely used to make a limited amount of callouts than being able to support, construct or aid my team.

That's why you have a chat restriction. Hopefully, the messages you choose not to send will be those negative ones.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
