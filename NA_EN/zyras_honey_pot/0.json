I must have posted in a similar thread, because someone brought up the same point in a different thread when someone had said it should have been marauder Quinn instead, and my argument was that it would be incredibly similar to Vayne, and possibly lead to confusion.

They do have some differences, which we'd have to accentuate to make it work.

I'm imagining an armored hawk similar to the Fire Nation war hawks in Avatar, the Last Airbender. It does have some really interesting themes to work off of, but it would have to be a lot more armor than cloth, which doesn't really scream Quinn to me, but regardless could look really sweet. \n\nWhile I more or less have your attention, and only if it isn't too much of a bother, I'm a high school student approaching graduation by December 2015, and I'm really aiming to get a job at Riot (preferably as a concept artist, I love coming up with new champion concepts and content), especially since I'm just a somewhat short drive from one of the studios.

This Maurader Ashe may just as well have been Quinn or Vayne with a different weapon. Quinn would at least have Valor appear frequently. Not only that, remember our vantage is somewhat behind/overhead meaning the bow will frequently get covered up to where you can't tell the difference anymore. Even with its size, you'll see the tips perhaps on either end. Quinn's arched stance alone would've made her easier to identify in this armor than Ashe:Vayne. Ashe has enough skins too... what's worse is this means Quinn won't get armor that looks similar because of the overlap. When Ashe has this many skins, she doesn't deserve to take up that look's slot IMHO. Not when it gates champions who deserve a new skin more.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Eyrgos","date":"2015-01-28T01:37:28.297+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":5,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot KateyKhaos,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=TKhEnmLu,comment-id=0006,timestamp=2015-01-27T23:38:16.747+0000)\n>\n> Hey there! \n> \n> When thinking about what makes a champion identifiable, we think about what their silhouette looks like - a shape that, even out of the corner of your eye, you'd likely be able to tell who it is.
