Every single game I go each and every single time. My top lane will feed. Now hold on it&#039;s not what you think. It's more of 60% of my top laners feed but there's my toxicity building in the first paragraph.\n\nIt will start in lobby all 6 bans are good and he wants to do garen in ranked, we ask nicely please play someone with more cc for us. An actual response &quot;F**k you.&quot; Okay so maybe he&#039;ll afk or dodge I can 4v5 or wait for a new team. We get into game and he dies to fiora for first blood, now it wasnt a troll death he tried to fight her ended up taking 2 tower shots because she baited him. TBH I think her W is retarded but he died. We told him &quot;Please play safe shyv will gank after lv 4&quot; The response he had is unknown to me since I muted him 1 milisecond in the game. But my team just sighed as he started feeding her intentionally. Long story cut short. I can&#039;t carry is top feeds and he went 2/15. Now I have to sacrifice the only role I truly love which is JG and go main top lane. I really love league, while there are characters who annoy me I love this game the community is terrible but when I have 4 friends in ranked it&#039;s the best time, only when we get that 1 trolling top laner every 6/10 games making it very difficult to climb.\n\nAfter the game we looked up the garen and he frequently does this. A huge portion of his games are him feeding and being either carried or losing, idk how he&#039;s allowed in ranked this seems very unfair.\n\ntl;dr anyone know a good top lane champ to play? leaning towards jayce","replies":[{"poster":"Miror B","date":"2016-10-12T12:35:58.946+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, you shouldn't have the mentality that you \"need\" to play a role because people keep feeding in games you're in. Even if you do swap roles, what's to say you won't get stuck with someone feeding in your original spot? Best thing you can do is just report those people/move on. Eventually they'll get suspended or banned thus thinning the herd of filth.","replies":[{"poster":"ggigotfed","date":"2017-09-30T17:08:43.267+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Mye,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Jmj0tO4H,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2016-10-12T12:35:58.946+0000)\n>\n> Yeah, you shouldn&#x27;t have the mentality that you &quot;need&quot; to play a role because people keep feeding in games you&#x27;re in.

I started just taking top, even the games where I don't get it. And guess what, I win each and every one of those games.

Just build full tank. If you need damage titanic hydra, frozen mallet, or maybe wits end. Play passive in lane and use your ult to try to help other lanes. Generally don't fight in lane unless you have the advantage from earlier kills, them tanking tower, or a gank because you're damage isn't very good. Jayce and wukong are also good choices if you want to be more aggressive.\nThat or play jungle and trust in statistics.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bruised Ego","date":"2016-10-12T12:32:03.784+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Play enough games and it should average out a bit.
