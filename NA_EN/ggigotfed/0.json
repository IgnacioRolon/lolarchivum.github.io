Hell the enemies had a strong vi and yasuo and all I had to do was W and pop my {{item:3003}} then continue mashing E and healing while they try to catch a zigzagging mute.\r\n\r\nI mean, they even had a blitz, a champion who just dumptrucks sona. What the hell is even a counter to her? She has almost no mana costs once you get a tear stacked, your healing is 1/3 of your life, and you dont have to stop to cast anything! \r\n\r\nRemember old heimer Q, he didn&#039;t even aim that bitch and could hit like 3 people at once, that got changed, but sona? Nah I&#039;m just gonna ult the frontline, press E then Q auto the assasin/adc whichever I feel deserves to die more, then walk out with E again all before my ult wore off. \r\n\r\n\r\ntl;dr just pick a support and build ap, specifically sona...it&#039;s great.","replies":[{"poster":"One Ashe On","date":"2017-08-03T03:32:13.886+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"AP Sona always remain squishy as hell and 1 good engage or silence can fuck her up real good.
