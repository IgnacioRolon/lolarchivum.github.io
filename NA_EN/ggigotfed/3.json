It has next to no cooldown. Amazing.\n\nW-  GG bitches, Every third hit vayn FUCKING KILLS YOUR ENTIRE TEAM. Oh my bad that&#039;s late game, every third hit vayn does 12% of your max life as true damage...what the fuck? Who invented true damage? **[Removed by moderation]** ...idk what that means but whoever made it is an asshole.\n\nE- GTFO! Vayn will shoot only what I can assume is her Pussydestroyer900withextravibrationandcumabsorbingpadstm at you and throw you clean across the fucking universe, if you collide with terrain, your asshole will be torn asunder.\n\nR- Outplayed, vayn activates her true anime spirit and pulls the bigboy boy off her back, during the next millenia vayn is the best player in the world, she can and will 1v5 your entire team. The ult is an enourmous buff as well as changing half her kit. Her passive is now doubled. she gets some ad and move speed, and now. When she presses Q, she FUCKING TURNS INVISIBLE! Goodluck staying out of a bad position because she&#039;ll \n roll around for 8 seconds while invis and fucking destroy you. \n\n\nNow you might be wondering &quot;She has a weakness right?! Anime always taught me you can defeat anything!!!!&quot;\n\nAnd you&#039;re kind of right you trogladite. Vayn is countered by other uncounterable bullshit. Malz  ult and vi ulz really dick her good, and so does a well placed pantheon rotation. Only, those characters DO have a form of counterplay, it&#039;s called {{item:3140}} Meaning, you can click her and she&#039;ll click you right back. Then delete you, your family, your dog, your friends, your friend&#039;s dog, and the nsa;)\n\nThe real counterplay to vayn is, FUCKING BAN HER! If someone on  your team wants her, FUCK HIM! you can&#039;t risk that 9lp, the enemy MIGHT get her and you know if the enemy has vayn she&#039;ll be a challenger smurf. While yours is still studying her passive at 18 mins in the game.\n\nWell that about summs up my hate rant for vayn,  DISCLAIMER! She&#039;s not actually fucking broken, Vayn can get nuked just as easily as every other adc, maybe more since if you&#039;ve ever fought her for more than 4 seconds, you can predict every move she does for 11 years. Plus, she&#039;s one of the hardest characters to play. Another meh tip to beat her is when you know she&#039;s ulted and you KNOW she&#039;s coming. Try to disengage and wait out her ult, this can most of the times be impossible seeing as she&#039;ll stun you and delete you, but if you have vision and you see her try to spook her ult out with a burst and then run the fuck away.\n\nThat&#039;s it. I hate you all","replies":[{"poster":"Woodakoodashooda","date":"2017-12-15T08:45:53.094+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":1,"body":"There is one thing that can best her.\n\n{{item:3814}} {{item:3142}} {{item:3147}} \n\nTri Blades of the Edgelord\n\nHide in a bush, knowing full goddamn well the enemy CANNOT see you because you're an edgelord.

The thing is, if you don't kill ADCs immediately and/or shut them down early (snowball) they end up being problematic for a lot of champs. Fighters or divers for example, won't be able to do jack. ADCs just outdamage everything else. They're weakness is supposed to be squishiness but this is mitigated in most of them through a combination of the support's peel and their own. \n\nSo you can't reliably outduel the ADC and you can't really catch them unless you are hypermobile.\nSo what are the solutions?\nQuick burst and mobility from assassins or pseudo assassins\nIt sucks for everyone else, but assassin-types of dmg (aka oneshots) are necessary to deal with the cancer of ADCs.\n\nThe one-shot nature of assassins/pseudo-assassins also happens to be extremely snowbally.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CC Mustang","date":"2017-12-15T15:49:07.363+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Vayns passive triples not doubles when she ults","replies":[]},{"poster":"Captainn Ginyu","date":"2017-12-15T09:17:53.515+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":2,"body":"this also made me crack the fuck up pretty hard have my upvote","replies":[]},{"poster":"General Esdeath ","date":"2017-12-15T21:46:36.326+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{item:3031}} {{item:3087}} {{item:3153}} {{item:3006}} \n\nR Q AA AA AA\n\nget outplayed kid {{sticker:vayne-pose}}","replies":[{"poster":"Tails9016","date":"2017-12-16T04:25:37.137+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"You'd be dead after the first auto unless you're nautilus","replies":[{"poster":"General Esdeath ","date":"2017-12-16T04:34:19.684+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:23}} I hit R.
