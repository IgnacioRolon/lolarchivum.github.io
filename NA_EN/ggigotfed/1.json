The buttrush to victory","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"So riot decided to completely dumpster the old season of...what did we do last season? Oh right mages bot lane or something stupid like that. Seems like them anyways. The new season adds armor plating for the first bit of the game, which makes 1st tier harder to kill but also rewards gold for rushing a short game. Oh the joy.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo now instead of trying to play with any form of strategy w/e the game is an absolute deathmatch. Try to stomp your enemies so hard and shove towers by the 10 minute mark that their &quot;late game comp&quot; doesn&#039;t even factor in. \r\n\r\n&quot;But I picked vayne&quot; Well I picked ezreal so I&#039;m gonna get an iceborn and have my xinzhao camp you for 5k gold. While I spend 5 minutes poking you with klepto from a safe distance. \r\n\r\nWhy bother building tank? Heck why bother even HAVING  tank. Attackspeed on hit proc shyvana ends games in literally 12 minutes. I either force people to afk or rage at eachother and start to feed. Which honestly makes me feel so bad I have to take my own life, unfortunately when I put the barrel in my mouth is was made of chocolate. I&#039;ll still finish the job it&#039;s just going to take a while to get type 2 diabetes. \r\n\r\nSupports are a thing of the past, Ever since pykes release. An assassin support..so..a mid laner in bot? Cool nothing new I&#039;ll just pick sona aaaand why am I dead. Oh he has camo and cc and better speed than me. Well no matter ap sona is a god late game...oh wait. Welp there goes my $60 of sona skins on a wasted champ. Maybe attackspeed sona jungle. \r\n\r\n\r\nI forgot what the topic was something about riot absolutely hating us or something about esports which honestly I could never care about. Yes some people who are REALLY good at the game get tons of money and provide absolutely nothing to society because &quot;entertainment&quot; whatever keep doing that money is money amirite? But instead of having the game progressively becoming more murder feast moba. Why not just do what you really want riot. Turn it into an mmo. C&#039;mon I know theres ONE intern there who is just pestering someone with the idea. And by god I support him! \r\n\r\nLook at that, not a single swear. Can you say reformed riot? No? Well $30 accounts are pretty cheap.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-12-13T03:51:49.191+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is every preseason ever.\n\nCalm down, spend a couple months raging at fortnite and bad AAA games instead, come back when stuff has stabilized.","replies":[]}]}
