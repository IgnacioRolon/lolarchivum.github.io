But this time i'm getting an error saying \"Update failed\" withh only 0.76mb remaining to download! >&lt; I've tried leaving it like that for a hour, tried patching again several times, tried repairing too but it just gets stuck at that 0.76mb mark!\r\n\r\nCan i please have one update where i can peacefully patch and play without having to wait for my friends to give me their patched files?! >","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2015-03-26T01:27:06.090+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi draykonian!\n\nIf you are consistently getting the \"Update Failed\" error when you try to patch, it sounds like there is an issue with your computer establishing a consistent connection with our patcher servers.  It appears that the connection is being terminated, or there is enough packet loss (or transient outages) that is preventing the patching process.  \n\nMake sure that you try all of the steps in our [Connection Issues Article](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues).  The steps here should help in resolving this issue, get rid of this damn error, and get you fully patched up.  If it still doesn't work, feel free to reply back to me and let me know!","replies":[{"poster":"draykonian","date":"2015-03-26T07:33:22.834+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've tried  everything, have followed all the steps riot mentioned, but nothing is working! And now all my friends are having the same problem. I tried disconnecting all other devices from the network so I'll have all  the bandwidth but it doesn't work either. If there was some packet loss or connection issue then why would it stop patching at the exact same spot every time?!","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2015-03-26T17:54:47.671+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Given that you are getting the error at 32% specifically, it seems that the issue may be related to a corruption in the patcher itself, rather than your connection.  In order to dig into it a bit deeper, can you complete the steps on our [Patcher Issues Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202969434-Patching-Issues)?  Some steps may seem very simplistic, but are crucial to ruling out some possible root causes.\n\nReply back and let me know if you're still having issues!","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"CIoud 9","date":"2015-03-25T22:34:31.432+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"same thing happening to me man last time i had this issue many more people had it as well i've tried everything riot says about this in the forums none of it works at all","replies":[]}]}
