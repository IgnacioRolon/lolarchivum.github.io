If you can clarify this for me, I can help out.","replies":[{"poster":"Phenyxs","date":"2016-08-23T12:04:24.980+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"No I didn't do either. I don't know how to create a in game ticket. I never had this issue before.  I asked around with people who have lvl 7 champ and they said it should go through.  I even bought more blue I didn't need and no. I did a repair and no. I played vel'koz every game last night and still wont lvl  him up. He is lvl 6 now.  Makes no sense.  About to move on. I have two other champs with one S to go but if it won't work then I am not wasting the time. The hex craft has issue and you see post about it all the time. Game runs well for me except that part. I have skins I bought from the project event missing but I am focused on rank and I don't want to cause issues So I say nothing.  I pretty much stay out of the hex craft now. I have 2 skins still there and I will decide in near future what to do with them. I have not had the best bang for my buck when it comes to the crafting of skin shards. Make it hard to want to spend more money like I usually do if it isn't worth the penny. I get champions and skins I already have for $50 and a week or so do it again and spend $25 to see and same again. So it is what it is.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-23T18:49:57.531+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you're experiencing a number of issues, so I'll address them in the order you brought them up. First, in order to hit level 7 mastery, you need to gain mastery tokens for that champion by earning an S or S+ grade while playing a match on Summoner's Rift. Other game modes cannot grant you these tokens. This is outlined in our [Champion Mastery Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204211284-Champion-Mastery-Guide).\n\nAre you also experiencing the client crash when you enter the Hextech Crafting Menu? If so, I recommend [completing a clean boot](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting#wq3) of Windows to see if you still experience this. \n\nHextech Crafting loot is essentially random, with the only modifier to the random chance being that it prioritizes giving you content you don't already own. Some rolls will be good, while some won't be. \n\nLet me know if I missed any of the issues you're experiencing or if I need to clarify anything further.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Ashen Rider","date":"2016-08-23T01:19:44.336+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe because there are tons of issues that they need to get around to, and they can't see everything? And even if they could, just because they didn't respond immediately doesn't mean they won't respond. Calm yourself.","replies":[]}]}
