The first person on the other team didn't ban and I was sent back to main screen and when I tried to start lobby again it said I left to many games. I don't afk a lobby or game. This happened not to long ago where I picked a champ to lock in and it wouldn't lock and got a 5 minute leaver. Now something is wrong and I would like it looked at please. I shouldn't get these 5 minutes leavers if I am not breaking the rules.","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-05-03T21:57:32.797+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Definitely understand where your frustration is coming from since you aren't doing anything wrong.  The real culprit seems to be the connection between your computer and the PvP.net Servers (the client, champ select, etc).  If your connection is unstable and disconnects during Champ Select, this would explain why you are booted out or are not able to lock in.\n\nTo get this resolved, make sure to complete all of the steps in our [Connection Issues Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues).  It should help make your connection stable and eliminate these leaver penalties.\n\nWrite me back if nothing seems to help!","replies":[{"poster":"Phenyxs","date":"2016-05-08T02:10:30.617+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi,\nThank You for getting back to me. I apologize for the lapse in returning a response but wanted to check out the link you provided as well as some things on my end. What I have done is cleared the cashe through the command prompt, also disabled the ivp6. The rest I have already done. I did double check everything. This is where I am at with the game. \n1-Logging in tends to tell me no server response. I re enter password and I get right in.\n2-If I message someone before going into a lobby ( draft ) the system tells me a error as occurred and refers me to a link on your site or contact support. I have looked at that and nothing I see tends to fix that. So for now I click ok and it goes away.\n3-when the matchmaking finds a game the map display for Summoners Rift is laggy almost like a fps issue. I have asked others in random if they notice it and getting a response back yes every time.\n4-while the first person in the draft chooses a ban the name shows up but not the champion. If they switch champions it then shows the picture and the rest of the bans are normally displayed.\n5-If I am in the client for to long I get Galio display if I want to go to the store. This causes me to log out and back in.\n\nFor the rest of what I see, I haven't had a issue with selection, I don't have lag in game. Once I did this week have the fps drop really super low in one game but that was it. I did nothing t respond to it and that hasn't happened sense. FPS and MS are stable playing the game, Not noticing lag or glitches.\n\nAs for the system I am running if this helps any.\nI have a Quad 3.2 processor\n18 gig ram\nintegrated 4k graphics chip\nRunning Microsoft 10 pro\nI have ccleaner pro\nrunning hard wire 100 mb internet speed with a cat 6 gold plated ends\nmy current ms is 8 from internet to your client\n\nI have been playing this game for about 2-2-1/2 yrs now. I needed a upgrade for a laptop when windows 10 came out. My old processor wasn't able to handle the game and the windows 10. So I had Microsoft help me in getting this one. Works great. Fast and silent background when I am on-line. Love it.  Also we looked up the requirements you have posted on the site for recommended pc requirements and we went beyond that.\n\nWhen I have a issue a report does get sent to Microsoft and they review it and if it is a concern on my end they send a patch in right away. But they are saying things on my end are normal and stable. Also double checked the internet speeds and there holding stable. So this really leaves me baffled as to what or where the issue is. This all really came to a head about 3 patches ago and has somewhat bounced up and down sense. I think a week or 2 ago you guys had some sever issues on your end which caused a shut down for a little bit and when started back up each time it tends to be goofy. I am not sure. I only see my end. I am good with computers, went to school for it. I am unable to address this. That's why I reached out to you for 2 reasons. 1- didn't want my account banned or get I trouble. 2-is I have noticed this for sometime and was trying to figure out where it was located at. My end or yours. I can only address my end. I have been gaming sense Activison was first launched on pc then went to console and I played every generation we had to the current ones now. I left playing with and for Activision due to didn't see eye to eye and I found this game and stuck with it sense. I love the game and how things sense I have been here have grown and the changes I have seen. I plan on being around playing LOL as long as possible.\n\nAnyways , a little back history and my current state. Sorry it is so big. If I am missing something please help me if you can. Otherwise I believe I gave you a good run down of my system as well as what I see in the game. \n\nThank You for your time and responding. Have a good day.","replies":[]}]}]}
