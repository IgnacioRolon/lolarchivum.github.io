Took a long time. Upon finishing that I checked all drivers to make sure they were updated also and everything is updated. Restarted the computer like usual and let everything cycle then launched league. I went to join a lobby in normal and everything was fine until the loading of the champion hit the rift and the project sound started it froze. I could not even back out of the game.  I was stuck.  I had to hold the power button to shut my system down.  What happened?  2 people in the draft lobby were talking about having issues playing and game locking up. I really didn't respond cause I typically don't have that issue until now. So I am not in a game I should be in. I am restarting the system and see what happens. Yesterday I was given a 5 minute sit because a lobby queue failed and it posted sending report to server you have been returned to your pre made. So I queued again and it tells me I left a match. Wasn't in a match. I played rest of the night no problem and today I get this issue.  Can someone help cause if I get in trouble for something I didn't do I will be upset. I don't dodge games or lobbies even if wanted to. I play the game out and move on. So why is this random glitches happening and I know I am not the only one. I well aware of the routes to take to repair certain issues and keeping my system updated so I am confused and right now extremely frustrated.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-07T17:21:09.047+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been seeing a number of reports of issues after installing some of the latest Windows Updates.

Last night after I went through everything it played good. Today I log on and first 2 games went good. Third game everything is fine until I load on the rift. Project theme song stuck on one tone and I can't do anything including backing out to quickly come back in the game. I had to hold down the power button. Everything in bug splat I did and everything is up to date on my system. I have spent hours on this. It isn't on my end. I never had this before and now I am sure another leavers for something I didn't do. People are complaining in game and dropping out of matches like files. Something is not right. Please help. I worked to hard and to much money and been the most positive player I can be overall to support this game. I now am getting concerned you will penalize me or ban me and I have followed every step and listen to your suggestions. As much as I know about computer I can not figure out what is going on. As I stated everything on my end is system required and fully up to date. Please respond and help me.
