That did help and was able to reinstall the game. I am able to play which I am happy. One thing is the ms is higher then normal and don't know why. I usually sit between 28-30 and now it is between 32-38. Also the loading for match to begin is long and people are dc. I wait it out and game begins.","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-07-29T17:21:18.328+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The slightly higher latency could be a number of things, but ~10 ms is extremely insignificant to the point that it's actually humanly impossible to notice. I wouldn't even bother investigating the cause unless it continues to rise regularly or have large spikes/packet loss.","replies":[{"poster":"Phenyxs","date":"2016-07-29T17:24:56.753+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-28T15:15:27.263+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like your network is having trouble establishing a connection to the server, which would prevent you from loading the patcher or logging in.  I agree with DTN that the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide would be a great first step to troubleshoot this.  I also recommend downloading the [Hextech Repair Tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752674-Network-System-and-League-of-Legends-Logs) which can help configure your firewall to allow League access.
