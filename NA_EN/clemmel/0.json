An enemy dodges.\n\nWe get in champ select with the same Player X, who team bans {{champion:350}} after I declare my intent to play her again.\n\nNow upset that he banned my {{champion:350}}, I feed his lane hard as {{champion:223}}, fighting toxicity with toxicity.\n\nI make friends with some enemies as we dance in baron pit, my teammates are laughing about it and the game is at very least entertaining to everyone except Player X who has been continuously flaming me in chat.\n\nShortly after an 0/23 game I receive a 14 day ban.\n\nSure, I hard int'ed. Yes I think a suspension is in order.\n\n_**Here's what I don't think is fair.**_\n\nI've been around since season 2, and have been an Honor 3 player without any prior suspensions or warnings. I know the typical response in this community and when dealing with Riot is \"We have 0 tolerance, you broke the rules, you're a negative impact on the game, go take your ban and play in the streets\". That said, I would wager it's almost certain that I've spread more positivity in this game than negativity. I'm not going to go out of my way to ruin someone's day unless they're being toxic. Obviously int'ing a lane and being toxic isn't a 'good' way to do that. But damn! I don't think anybody who ints for the first time is aware that it's a 2 week ban no questions asked. I've been playing for years and that's not something I've bothered to research. If I had known that an automated system was going to come along, look at the one game I had in a sour mood and kick me off the game for 14 days during some prime summer nights, I never would've done it. Two weeks may not seem like a long time to some players, but I'm playing with friends every single day for multiple hours... 14 days hurts.\n\n_**So my questions are:**_\n\n1. What do you think a justified ban for this scenario is?\n\n2. Should players who are 'new' to toxic behavior receive warnings before action is taken?\n\n\nEDIT:\n\nNot sure why this is attracting many downvotes, I merely presented a scenario and some questions. The best way for Riot to hear about potential improvements to their system is reading a productive discussion. Don't downvote everything I write because I inted, if there's a case to be heard by the lesser heard side, at least provide a refutation.","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-06-15T01:29:06.648+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's _supposed_ to hurt. **Don't int.**","replies":[{"poster":"Clemmel","date":"2019-06-15T01:32:30.373+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":12,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=KFCeytron,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=LqVrQV2j,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2019-06-15T01:29:06.648+0000)\n>\n> It's _supposed_ to hurt. **Don't int.**\n\nWell of course, but how is an ignorant player (such as myself, pre-ban) supposed to decide not to int for the first time, if they're not aware of the punishment?","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-06-15T01:51:09.030+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ce2727,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=LqVrQV2j,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2019-06-15T01:32:30.373+0000)\n>\n> Well of course, but how is an ignorant player (such as myself, pre-ban) supposed to decide not to int for the first time, if they're not aware of the punishment?\n\nHow about the [Terms of Use](https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/legal/termsofuse) you agreed to when you signed up, which tells you to review the [Summoner's Code](https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/featured/summoners-code), prominently featuring \"Never feed intentionally and don't give up the fight!\"?","replies":[{"poster":"Clemmel","date":"2019-06-15T02:00:03.493+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":7,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=KFCeytron,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=LqVrQV2j,comment-id=000000000001,timestamp=2019-06-15T01:51:09.030+0000)\n>\n> How about the [Terms of Use](https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/legal/termsofuse) you agreed to when you signed up, which tells you to review the [Summoner's Code](https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/featured/summoners-code), prominently featuring \"Never feed intentionally and don't give up the fight!\"?\n\nI'd bet that players who know about how the ban system works, learn it by by word of mouth, or visiting the forums like everyone reading this.
