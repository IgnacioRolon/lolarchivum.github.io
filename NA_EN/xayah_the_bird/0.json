In last season i got honor lvl 5 and i really dont ususally flame. But today i played one game with my friend in bronze and ofc we got really bronze teammates. As an adc i got mad at my support being a prick, basically not doing anythign helpful. So i tell him &quot;you know your passive can heal me when you kill a minion right?&quot; after that he started spamming in all chat, begging them to report me. He said &quot;i hope you get perma banned&quot; and stuff like that. Also midlaner comes to his aid saying &quot;stfu&quot;. So i was like okay please *kys*, when i was super mad. Then i stopped using chat so i wouldnt really say anything else. \r\nWe won the game, so i was like - yea whatever dont report him its ok.\r\nThen i get the ban notification.\r\nDon&#039;t get how i get banned for saying one word. I even stopped chatting later to avoid being more mad. \r\nAlso I really don&#039;t usually flame.\r\nSo why ban? For one time use?\r\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}}","replies":[{"poster":"Leylania","date":"2018-01-27T19:26:22.902+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"> So why ban?

If there is no further toxic behavior, then the player can keep playing after that.","replies":[{"poster":"Six Inch Heals","date":"2018-01-28T17:04:01.035+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Then that's not zero tolerance.

Minor, but words mean things. Zero tolerance, to me, states that you&#x27;re basically run the fuck out of Verona for the language.\n\nIn this context, zero tolerance means immediate punishment. Normally, one game of toxic chat isn't enough to warrant punishment. It normally takes several games of toxic chat to earn a chat ban, and then the punishments start escalating from there. \n\nSome players live sheltered lives and honestly don't realize just how offensive they're being. They have friends who say stuff like that all the time. They haven't noticed other players getting punished for that behavior. An instant permaban is a bit too excessive. A 14 day ban, on the other hand, has a strong chance of leading to a permaban, since it only takes one more game of bad behavior to cross the line.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Xayah the bird","date":"2018-01-27T19:29:23.232+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Leylania,realm=EUW,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=WBu9xAaW,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2018-01-27T19:26:22.902+0000)\n>\n> Because you told someone to end their life over a video game?
