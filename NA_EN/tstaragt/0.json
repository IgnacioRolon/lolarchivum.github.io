Again I am not saying never play these champs just that to truly improve and be able to grasp the concepts of these very difficult champs you need an insanely good grasps of the game itself before even trying to make these part of your consistent champ pool.","replies":[{"poster":"TstarAgt","date":"2015-03-08T07:41:21.821+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lmao I never said I master them like I said I was listing the champs I play I have no idea why u would think I mastered all of them it even says tips like bro -_-","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Earthpine","date":"2015-02-21T15:28:21.528+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"With {{champion:102}} you should harass the enemy laner by using the combo E W Q. This allows you to deal extra damage from the E, more ms from the W and a double hit from the Q. Keep on doing this until  the enemy is low.
