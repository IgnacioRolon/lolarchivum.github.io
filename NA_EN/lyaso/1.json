Meanwhile Lee becomes a balance problem and defines the meta at least once every season but I doubt Riot is ever going to change his kit. AD Kennen was never a problem before the tanky on-hit version was discovered. That's not a problem with Kennen in particular. That's a problem with Frozen Mallet being utterly toxic, especially on ranged champions. It's not the first time the item did that to a champion. Gnar uses mallet? Gets nerfed for it. Yasuo uses mallet? Gets nerfed for it. Kennen uses mallet? Gets nerfed for it. Mallet gives tankiness to champions that usually should not have it while making them almost unreachable and inescapable with slows. That item either collects dust or breaks a champion. The mage update fiasco was also the only time AP Kennen was a notable problem (along with almost every other mage at that time). Back then Rylais was beyond OP and Protobelt and revolver were much stronger too. The simultaneous tick changes were fine. It's just that Riot ALSO buffed the damage on it AND made the damage frontloaded in the first ticks so it would burst like crazy. That was just another typical class update fail. It's one of the many reasons why Riot no longer updates classes anymore. It simply breaks too many things at once.","replies":[{"poster":"Tormentula","date":"2018-07-07T22:04:42.442+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Impish Yordle,realm=EUW,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=Q30wxkKg,comment-id=000100000000000100010000,timestamp=2018-02-02T17:48:00.238+0000)\n>\n> He's barely ever on the patch notes to be a balance problem.\n\n**7.1\n7.3\n7.7\n7.9\n7.13**\n7.22\n8.3\n8.9\n8.10\n\nHe's pretty familiar with patch notes, especially real close together for half a season.\n\nI don't think mallet was the issue either, since BoTRK + runaan's was being played in both top and ADC and I'm pretty sure ADC kennen went for wave clear items over FM. \n\nThe questionable one is gnar because mallet just synergizes too well for him, but nobody else really builds it(the item is subpar on majority users so is it the item or the champ in combo with it?) like urgot isn't broken atm, mallet shyvana wasn't really why shy was strong at the time and she still fell out of the meta hard without touching mallet, so... nerf mallet for gnar and urgot and shy, or just nerf gnar instead of mallet? \n\nYas had issues with mallet too but yas is yas, mallet or not he has issues, tank yas in general needed shut down, and look we did, and I don't think we gutted mallet to do it.

One badly-made patch on Kennen transitioned into other bad patches that they made in an attempt to fix the mistakes of each previous patch rather than the champion himself but they ultimately were related and caused by the same thing during that period. It all started when they straight-up overbuffed AP Kennen and responded to it by overnerfing him and then they proceeded to overbuff botrk just to repeat the same mistakes with AD Kennen who got forced into that build due to the previous mage update disaster gutting his AP build and then they decided to actually buff AP Kennen back to relevancy. A lot of those patches did not need to happen if they had actually thought things true especially considering that they all were a ultimately a result of their mage update disaster. One big mistake they kept adding other mistakes on. Most of it was stuff that should've been dealt with in 1-2 patches but due to their shortsightedness it turned more and more into a matter of them being forced to fix their own patch mistakes rather than actually addressing something Kennen was responsible for on an inherent level. Everything else was mostly changes that got thrown in as quality-of-life or power shifts/experimentation among other things rather than addressing problem cases where Kennen himself was directly to blame.\n\nOn-hit Frozen Mallet Kennen was the first and only time an AD Kennen build was a problem. ADC Kennen who built like a traditional squishy was always fine. Urgot has low-range for a ranged champion and little to ways to actually kite and tends to go into melee range anyway. He even has a self-slow in his kit. Mallet is mostly there to subvert the weakness his kit imposes on him. On champions like Gnar and Kennen mallet amplifies something they were already good at whereas on Urgot it makes him suck less at something he already wasn't that good at in the first place. Shyv has little to no CC so she cannot use it to stack it up with other stuff on her kit. Yasuo on the other hand has good CC, great chase and escape potential with E as well as mid-range kiting through Q and it creates even more indirect tankiness and effective health when combined with PD movement speed and damage reduction. Mallet received nerfs when Frozen Force Tanksuo was a thing. It had its AD reduced to make it less effective on damage-dealers. Overall perma-slows are not very healthy and they are frustrating too. It ended up gutting Rylais too. Making them impactful is a recipe for disaster and while some champions may be dependent them, other champions will simply abuse them. I'd rather have champions be made less dependent on needing permaslow so that this problem can finally be put to rest and champions like Gnar can stop being defined by it and be rebalanced around other things.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"DeadUnborn","date":"2018-01-31T22:44:20.492+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":4,"body":"His kit is lackluster.

This is all because you Developers thought her Mantle of Decorum was a better design choice for her, but you couldn't be bothered to make that the best it can be for five years.
