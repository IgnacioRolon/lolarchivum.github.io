No lag, no freezing, but my pc did an update last night and i turn my computer on, and now when i go to play i get past the que, past champion select, through the loading screen, but right when everyone is about to spawn, it crashes and i have to turn the pc off. It keeps me from connecting into the game. Any advice?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-13T23:04:17.318+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you could have corrupt game files causing your game to crash, but it could be other factors too.  I suggest going through the [game crash](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes+) guide to resolve this.  I know you mentioned doing updates, but make sure your drivers are as well!  Hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
