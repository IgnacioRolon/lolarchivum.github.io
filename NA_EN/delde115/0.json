[Small rant]","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":3,"down_votes":4,"body":"[Rant starts with Ziggs, and then it goes a bit of track, but its somewhat related]\r\n\r\nIm just curious to know.\r\n\r\nI understand that its something fun. But it gets tiring. Not only is it not healthy (gameplay wise), because he can destroy a turret with **one** ability, but its also getting VERY VEEEEERY boring to play WITH and against.\r\n\r\nYeah you can just ban him, true, I&acute;ll give you that, but is it worth banning a champion only because a streamer/youtuber/pro-player/no-lifer was so bored to come up with this?\r\n\r\nI want my games to be exciting and challenging. Having this annoying trend killing the fun and mood of botlane is making me (a support main that has been playing support since May of 2013) leave that role. Then add the &quot;weak&quot; adc mains who are also leaving botlane because &quot;we can no longer 5v1&quot;is just... *****long sigh***\r\n\r\n\r\nRiot, can you we just leave botlane as it is? A lane with a Marksmen and a Support? You already tried with Mordekaiser and look how much fun we had! We had so much fun with Morde botlane that not only did you get threats from Morde mains, but you also got threats from adc mains and support mains.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nRiot, I understand you want to spice things up, but if something isnt broke, dont fix it.\r\n\r\nIf the Marksmen + Support combo works perfectly well in the botlane, dont try to change an already perfect formula. Lets be real, you guys want to change it because you want the LCS to be more entertaining and stuff. You want to see epic wombo combos but you dont know what else to do.\r\n\r\nStop putting so much focus on the LCS and put some focus on us, you know, the 90% of the player base that likes to play draft normals or the ranked players that are below Diamond 4. Keep balancing the game around Challenger players, that I dont mind, but just stop, take a deep breathe and listen to the semi casual players for a while. We brainless noobs may no nothing about balancing the game, but it doesnt take a genius to know when something has gone a bit too far.\r\n\r\nSo please Riot, dont try to explore new things for the botlane, I saw what you guys wrote in the Ask Riot webpage about Ziggs and no one wants another failed Mordekaiser experiment. Cause it ends up affecting every single elo, even pro levels of play, *****Cough cough***** _Mordekaiser Worlds 2015_  *****Cough cough*****","replies":[{"poster":"RivetAce","date":"2017-01-13T18:14:32.960+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I believe it was Shiphtur, anyone feel free to correct me if I'm mistaken.","replies":[{"poster":"RocketRelm","date":"2017-01-13T18:24:32.745+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, it was Shiptur.

He's just what rose it to prominence.\n\nI've run Veigar, Yorick, Heimerdinger, Jayce, Yasuo, TF, Gangplank, Malzahar, Cassiopeia, Karthus, Ziggs, and Azir bot lane, with fairly typical builds. I've run AP Kog'maw and AP Varus bot lane. The main reason I don't make a habit out of it is either not enjoying playing the champions enough to main it, or my team's QQ, or both. Usually, both. Not because they can't be used or are particularly awful there. \n\nThe reason you run an ADC is damage to objectives and damage to tanks. There are mages that meet that criteria, some of them, in spades. However, most perform better in mid or top lane than in bot lane. That does not mean that they do not perform decently enough there at that role when compared to a traditional marksman. The nail in the coffin is that they're also harder to fit into normal team compositions.","replies":[]}]}
