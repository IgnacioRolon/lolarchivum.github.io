But I know better. The only reason he hit gold is because he duo queued with his support friend at the time, who carried him to gold. He was always mystified as to why his other friend stopped playing with him and got to plat and eventually diamond, but I didn&rsquo;t have the heart to tell him.\n\nFlash forward to today. He&rsquo;s angry and pissed off at league all the time we play, and he&rsquo;s a toxic little snot. He won&rsquo;t play ranked because he gets crushed and it hurts his self esteem. So I play normals with him, and there are some days where I just want to tell him the truth. He&rsquo;s egotistical and naturally assumes all the CS and jungle camps belong to him so he can &ldquo;carry us&rdquo;. In fact, the only time he plays well with me is when I support for him and force feed kills down his throat.\n\nBut when I jungle or top, he&rsquo;s completely hopeless and assumes it&rsquo;s the other rando&rsquo;s fault he sucks so bad. Some days I wonder if I ever stopped playing with him, he&rsquo;ll get the self awareness to learn he&rsquo;s actually responsible for his own failures and not his team mates/Riot.\n\nMy boosted, toxic friend.","replies":[]}
