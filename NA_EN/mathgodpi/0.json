Each fountain has a laser which damages any enemy player who enters the fountain; it is there supposedly as a way of preventing one team&#039;s players from killing the other team&#039;s players in their own spawn area. In other words, the fountain is meant to be an area of _**total safety**_, where there is virtually no possibility of being killed. However, in games where the teams are horribly stacked in favor of one team, the team that dominated the match will stand outside the enemy team&#039;s spawn and refuse to end the game, instead opting to get a bunch of free kills while spamming emotes, Ctrl 1/2/3/4, etc, to rub salt in the wound. Often times it&#039;ll be crap players who think they&#039;re so great just because they know they are going to win the game and they have the enemy team in a helpless position, while ignoring the fact that this only happened because of the team they happened to be on (and the lane opponents they happened to be against). They want to rub endless salt in the wound and run up their KDAs while running up the death totals for their opponents, instead of just ending the game.\r\n\r\nThe problem with the current fountain setup is that it allows enemy players with long range abilities/attacks to pile up kills in this way with ease, while creating an extremely unpleasant experience for the players of the other team. If you&#039;ve just been through a frustrating game (and perhaps a string of frustrating games), the absolute last thing you need is a bunch of conceited jerks mocking you and making your situation even more inflammatory than it already is.\r\n\r\nIt&#039;s time to either poop or leave the can, Riot. Quit trying to pretend that you&#039;re providing a safe space for your players, as it&#039;s clear that you&#039;re really not. The laser is little more than a facade which doesn&#039;t offer much in the way of real protection. Either give 100% damage protection (including spell blocking so Blitz can&#039;t grab someone out of their fountain) when someone is inside their own fountain, or get rid of the laser altogether.","replies":[{"poster":"Modi","date":"2019-01-05T19:55:42.557+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Compared to anywhere else on the map, yes, it is reasonably safe.","replies":[{"poster":"Mathgodpi","date":"2019-01-05T21:16:03.049+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not supposed to be compared to other areas of the map.

That is the only way to make it any reasonable bit of fair.","replies":[{"poster":"Mathgodpi","date":"2019-01-09T19:16:33.145+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agreed.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Imperial Pandaa","date":"2019-01-05T12:42:46.999+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"If only there was something that the team being surrounded at their fountain could possibly do to end the game.

Some people think that LoL is Call of Duty rather than a MOBA with items and levels, and that they can totally win if they avoid all the bullets and aim really well, even when they're standing at the back of the fountain because they're unable to engage without instantly dying.","replies":[{"poster":"Xidphel","date":"2019-01-05T16:43:09.199+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"What are you talking about?","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-01-06T00:49:02.689+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Xidphel,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=r8sEUbaW,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2019-01-05T16:43:09.199+0000)\n>\n> What are you talking about?\n\nI'm talking about how some people refuse to surrender even when the enemy team is spawnkilling them, because they don't understand the concept of snowballing. \"The enemy team may have had better strategy/skills when we were evenly matched in stats, but now that they have better strategy/skills AND stats, we will surely beat them!\" It just wastes everyone's time.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Modi","date":"2019-01-05T16:54:54.644+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is not an area of \"total safety\", it is meant to be an area of **reasonable safety**. An unwanted guest in the fountain will almost certainly die. That does not preclude them from doing significant damage, though. While it may be in poor taste to spawn kill like that, there is nothing against the rules about it.\n\nHaving been on both sides of the dominating & dominated sides of  games, it would be ridiculous to have the fountain be perfect safety, unless there was also the trade off that you could not use any skills in the fountain. if I can't damage you in your fountain, then you have no right to damage me from sitting in your fountain. Riot understands this trade-off, which is why they opted to make it so both teams can do damage around the fountain, but gave the defending team a significant advantage: the fountain laser and and the massive resource regeneration. I played quite a few ARAM games where the dominating team did this sometime around minute 30, when they were all level 18, and we were only 14-16. They dove in, killed one of our teammates, but we were able to poke them down enough to engage and ace them. We then pushed the lane all the way down (we had barely touched the outer turret) and won the game.\n\nIt sucks to be on the receiving end of this, but if played well, you can turn the tide in your favor.","replies":[{"poster":"Mathgodpi","date":"2019-01-05T19:10:19.492+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's not an area of reasonable safety.
