So you use the first time as an excuse and go god if people couldnt use champs in ranked until theyre mastery x, things would be 10000x times better. I am CERTAIN that you would have the same amount of feeding in your games with a mastery restriction. Then you would go god if only i didnt get feeders it would be 1000x better. if only i didnt get trolls it would be 1000x better.

Different people improve at different rates, and you'll always find individual cases where someone has played a champion a ton of times and still sucks on that champion. But the fact remains - there is a positive correlation between practising a champion and getting better at that champion.\n\nI can tell you with all honesty, in my ranked games, there is a VERY strong, consistent correlation between feeding teammates and lack of experience on the champion they were playing.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"KVbqbFsC8e","date":"2019-08-06T03:58:48.950+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"That would just make you have to go through hours upon hours of meaningless mastery grinding.
