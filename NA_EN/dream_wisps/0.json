The reworked akali just dropped on live servers, and of course the first thing I always do is listen to the soundtrack. As soon as it started playing, I was mistified. It sounds so beautiful and really gives you the feel of being a ninja. I don&#039;t know what instrument that is, but the string gives the song a wonderful melody, and I love how different every piece of the soundtrack is. Riot&#039;s music is really underrated. Good job to whoever wrote this one! When I first hear the soundtracks, for example GGMF, and pyke, I didn&#039;t like the beat, but as soon as you listen to all of it you instantly love it. My favorites are Irelia&#039;s, Akali&#039;s, and Lunar Revel. Keep up the good work, and hopefully people will actually try and listen to the soundtrack instead of instantly jumping into a game with her!\n\nAnyways, if you read this and havn&#039;t hear the entire soundtrack, I highly recommend giving it a try!\n\n\nPs. The flute and drums also give it a mysterious flare! Again great job. I absolutely love it!","replies":[{"poster":"Talondor","date":"2018-08-02T17:42:19.379+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks very much for the kind words, we're so glad to hear you're enjoying Akali's music!

Even among people who talk about the music, I haven't heard anyone bring up his theme. Ultimately I can understand why though, its not music that most people are bound to like. They picked a genre they knew was obscure and unpopular, but as a fan of Industrial Metal I certainly liked it, I think it stands as a solid piece of its own within the genre, and I think the fact that riot chose it shows me that they are willing to put in a lot of effort to make sure they have the perfect theme for a champ.\n\nI eagerly anticipate when Mordekaiser gets reworked for a multitude of reasons, but hearing what bad ass Heavy Metal track comes with him is bound to be a highlight.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Larriet","date":"2018-08-02T19:20:26.729+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you mean a specific year for Lunar Revel, or the track that's just called \"Lunar Revel\"?
