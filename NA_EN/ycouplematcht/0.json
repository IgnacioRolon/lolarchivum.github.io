Defending yourself is done in a mature and respectful manner or with the mute button and does not involve shouting insults and name-calling, the latter of which is what people who claim to be defending themselves are actually doing. From the [Instant Feedback System FAQ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207489286): \n\n>**WHY WAS I PUNISHED WHEN THE OTHER PERSON WAS WORSE OR STARTED IT!**\nSimply speaking, retaliation is not an acceptable or justifiable behavior. An argument between two players can easily create a negative experience for the rest of the players in the game with you. Regardless of the other player’s actions, this does not justify your own behavior. You alone are responsible for your actions within the game. If you encounter a toxic player like this, the best option is to simply report their behavior and move on.\nReports are a vital piece to the puzzle. If you are not sure of what sort of behavior is reportable take a look at the [Reporting a Player FAQ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752884-Reporting-a-Player)\n\n2) Riot tried handing out infinite chat restrictions and it didn't succeed in reforming players like they'd hoped. From [Riot Tantram:](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/wsObUaFj-if-tyler1?comment=00010001000000000000) \n\n> It really breaks down into two categories.\n> \n> 1.) Helping players reform\n> 2.) Shielding others from the behavior, at a cost.\n> \n> We used to issue chat restrictions that essentially scaled indefinitely. \n> \n> We were able to determine that after a certain point the penalty no longer helped with reform. The 10-game and 25-game counts for chat restrictions are based on data that they were both light enough, and felt strict enough to encourage people to understand their behavior is unacceptable in game and change it.\n> \n> We also saw that the players in this &#x27;large restriction&#x27; category defaulted to gameplay altering means of harassing their team. It caused an increase in feeding and trolling.\n> \n> The sample size of this population and time frame is huge. Essentially the time spanning from the introduction of chat restrictions to the introduction of IFS.\n> \n> So my question for you is, would you rather have more feeders and less negative chat?\n\nIf someone isn't gonna interact with others in a mature and respectful manner despite getting multiple chances to do so then why shouldn't they be removed from the community?\n\nNow if you would like to discuss your ban then please post your entire unedited chat logs here in this thread.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tf 420","date":"2018-04-02T21:56:49.597+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=YcouplematchT,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=JjawTAwP,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2018-04-02T21:42:29.773+0000)\n>\n> All riot has to do is just give out chat restrictions and suspensions and no perm bans.
