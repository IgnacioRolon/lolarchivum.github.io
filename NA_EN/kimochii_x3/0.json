Last 2 games that I played we had vayne players with classic skins, splash arts and icons were perfect, no errors, but when we entered in-game I encountered the bug.. The complete art on vayne was full blue, like missing image or something like that ._. (i suck at this.. let just the pics show you what i mean..)\r\n2. It just happened, I didnt do anything, the game loaded vayne&#039;s in-game model without any textures or graphics, full blue model.\r\n3. As I said, this happened the last 2 games I played.. I will play one again to see will it happen again.\r\nHere are some images of the bug:\r\na) http://i.imgur.com/BRmxZgb.jpg\r\nb) http://i.imgur.com/YLAkdZz.jpg\r\nc) http://i.imgur.com/9uJpIgr.jpg\r\nd) http://i.imgur.com/p8Tu48V.jpg\r\ne) http://i.imgur.com/vAVpEPO.jpg\r\nf) http://i.imgur.com/jVO7y9H.jpg\r\ng) http://i.imgur.com/GxdtuYf.jpg\r\nh) http://i.imgur.com/07se6qm.jpg\r\ni) http://i.imgur.com/6r8McG7.jpg\r\nj) http://i.imgur.com/VzxTfPL.jpg\r\nTried to ask the others, do they have the same bug/problem, but they didnt said anything..\r\n\r\nI hope this is topic is correct, if not then please tell me.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-12-07T19:07:34.193+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Kimochii x3!\n\nThanks for the great bug report - images are always helpful! \n\nIt appears that you're missing textures (this blue is indicative of missing textures, and also shows up for missing particles!)\n\nThe client updates files on a pretty frequent basis, which means it's entirely possible some files got jumbled  around and ended up misplaced. \n\nIn this case, I'd suggest performing a client repair. You can do that by launching the client and clicking on the [?] button on the upper right corner of the client. (It's on the 'launch' page, not the login screen.) There will be an option to repair your client - select that! Doing this will correct errors in your files, and should resolve this issue! If you're still experiencing this afterwards, please feel free to let me know!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Punkkee","date":"2015-12-06T05:24:42.009+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"did you try restarting","replies":[]},{"poster":"ttt","date":"2015-12-06T05:22:09.764+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think your game files are corrupt.
