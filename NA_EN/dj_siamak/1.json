You have a champion that presses R, gaining a massive amount of AD and range. And if done correctly, she&#039;s able to pull off her entire combo in 0.9 seconds and 100-0 anything squishy, and still probably killing anything remotely durable. There&#039;s legit no counterplay to this. None. She just presses R, flash + stuns and absolutely wrecks you.\r\nPeople talk about Akali&#039;s biggest flaw as a design is there&#039;s no gameplay, which is true. You either out-tank her and kill her or you manage to burst her, if you don&#039;t accomplish either then you die. It&#039;s really no different with Riven except against Akali you can cast spells. Riven can cancel both your spells AND auto attacks so even if you&#039;re something with access to durability (Nasus/Ren ult, Jax ult, etc) you don&#039;t even get an opportunity to accesss it until you are half health because she&#039;s stunned and combo&#039;d you and you can&#039;t trade AAs because of the steroid on her ult. It even has virtually n ocooldowns.\r\nWhy is this allowed? Why am I not only unable to outdamage her but I&#039;m also unable to cast spells because I&#039;m chain cc&#039;d while dying quickly.\r\nWe removed silences for this on champions like Kassadin and LeBlanc because there was no meaningful way to fight them back. This isn&#039;t different, a kit lie Riven&#039;s with the steroids galore should, at bare minimum, have some type of delay on her CC so that she doesn&#039;t either mitigate massive amounts of damage or deal too much damage for me to handle whlie stunned and I have to be afraid of the AoE executes. Don&#039;t even suggest to &quot;just engage on her,&quot; because that doesn&#039;t work. She has just as much disengage as she does the potential to engage so even when you try to do this, you still get out-traded without being able to damage her. You basically have to wait for her to fuck up.\r\nThere are small windows of weaknesses in Riven&#039;s kit, much the same way Fizz has this problem. These weaknesses pale in comparison to how oppressive their strengths are and their vulnerabilities aren&#039;t nearly as close to exploitable compared to how much raw power thye have.\r\nBottom line is this, Riven is a champion that seems to bet nerfed every single season and we are 5 seeasons in with it still being a problem. Something needs to be done, I don&#039;t care that high elo Riven mains think she&#039;s fine or try to tell you she&#039;s balanced. There&#039;s just as many high elo players, if not more, who think she&#039;s complete bullshit. Redidt white knight heroes just constantly try to jerk her mains to death and nobody wants to do anything about it. Riven is a champion that currently abuses mechanics in the game that you&#039;ve addressed in other forms with other champions because it lacked meaningful counterplay.","replies":[{"poster":"Joe Dredd","date":"2015-08-08T13:35:26.350+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":8,"body":"no counterplay to veigar ult\nhe r i die\nboo hoo\nabsolutely no counterplay none","replies":[{"poster":"Forn ala creme","date":"2015-08-08T14:07:21.029+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do like from Karthus ult, flash!","replies":[{"poster":"Nidalee SO NYAAA","date":"2015-08-08T18:06:35.513+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{item:3157}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Knight SoIaire ","date":"2015-08-08T14:15:38.139+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":4,"body":"and what did riot do to him \n\nmade him unable to get his targets to stand still \n\nso he usualy gets hard pushed by enemy front line","replies":[{"poster":"Byakuya Kuchiki","date":"2015-08-08T20:42:56.840+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"doesnt matter if they're moving just have to have your mouse over them for a split second and press r","replies":[{"poster":"Knight SoIaire ","date":"2015-08-08T20:50:48.888+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you didnt understand me at all \n\nveigars cage was strong because it allowed him to get enemy backline into range \nj\n\nnow without the stun ... veigar needs to get through the fronltine first ... thats hard for him","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Baunjo","date":"2015-08-08T14:23:45.154+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":16,"body":"1) She does not complete her combo in 0.9 seconds, i have no idea where in hell you got this idea from.\n2) She has plenty of meaningful counter play. Riven is the worst champion on the map without kills, her lategame scaling needs plenty of items to make her this unstoppable monster everyone sees her as. Therefore you punish her early on, and maintain steady harass on her. Whenever Rivens E is on cooldown is a very good time to trade. either that or she gets zoned. Also anytime riven has to use Q and E to gap close, her damage is greatly reduced, and is only increased with each time she uses Q. Try and judge things like this for yourself. Finally Riven's Q is actually a lot easier to dodge then you think. You can sidestep it, like a skillshot. \n\nThere ya go counterplay solved.

GP's orange has a long CD, so does Yi's meditate...  Why Fizz and Raven get really low cd on defensive abilities I don't know...  riot really messed up on both of these guys.  If they are allowed to be powerful they are 100% dominant, their balance always sits on a razor edge.  It's the fault of offense + defense tied abilities which allow them to trade most effectively, assassinate and escape.\n\nWhen people say these champs take skill they also miss a very important point...  Yes it takes skill to time your shield, but you have that shield which if used right completely turns the fight around.  The reward for skill is too high.  This is the same thing Lee Sin faced through s2.  Sure he had a lot to his kit you had to manage, but the reward was off the charts (and tbh the risk wasn't exactly low either)\n\nI was playing as GP against a riven the other day and I harassed her down to about 10% health.  This isn't an exaggeration, she was very very low, meanwhile I was at 90% health.  We engage at my tower and in the time of her stun I'm reduced to 10% health along with her, and her shield blocks my parrrley giving her fb.\n\nChampions neeeeeed to have weaknesses.  This has been a MAJOR overhaul Riot has done taking away silences on Kassadin and tweaking other champions.  Riven neeeeeeds a rework to give her a weakness.  If she is going to be resource free she needs to have meaningful cd's, especially on defensive abilities.  I think 14 seconds max rank on her shield, and an additional 2 seconds to each dash ability.  Another option would be to add mana costs so she can't spam abilities in lane shielding every harass while trading with her 2 cc abilities.\n\nI prefer the idea of giving her mana.  All the talk about Riven skill will get real when a Riven ult + q's in without the mana to w and e.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SpecterVonBaren","date":"2015-08-08T19:18:59.657+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"At least Akali's escape has the counterplay of buying a pink ward, Riven just smashes her buttons and outruns anyone that isn't Rammus.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SunriseSkaterKid","date":"2015-08-09T00:41:09.219+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Once again another biased plat-bronze post about how riven is broken...

I main Riven and I'm very confident in lane if I'm not counter picked(and yes there are counter picks for her) but late game gets dangerous for her in an even match. I have never played her successfully in an ARAM. Shes just not designed to take the kind of dmg u need to be able to survive. It usually goes just jump in with ur team and try to get off as much dmg as possible with ur combo before u hit cooldowns and die. So just to clarify my point: shes not horribly broken and impossible to play against, shes just supposed to be difficult to lane with. She has weaknesses people just need to look for them, and if u find her weaknesses aren't as big as a lot of champion's, then just suck it up because there are many champions out there with few weaknesses.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mandang0","date":"2015-08-08T19:03:51.658+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Nice post, but some paragraphs wouldn't kill you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"YossarianSensei","date":"2015-08-09T04:47:33.823+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think so.\n\nThe counterplay is don't stand so close if you think she can gib you.
