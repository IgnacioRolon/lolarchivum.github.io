I'm here to tell you all why it should be brought back. Not everyone has time for a full game of SR or TT, and I'm sure we've all gotten leave warnings from playing and shoddy wifi disconnecting us multiple times, so we know punishments for AFKs are rather severe. So in that case, what can we play? ARAM. All Random (sort of) All Mid. Games take around 20 minutes to complete, so there's our answer. But not quite. I've played around 600 games of ARAM, and many times I have a lot of fun, but it has come to my attention that most of the games that I play are pretty much decided from the start. One team has all bruisers and the other has janna, sona, and 3 ADCs. It isn't even about skill at that point. When the game is \"randomly\" tilted in one team's favor, even if one team is more skilled than the other and seizes every opportunity they get, they can still easily lose because of a lottery. If not Dominion, there should be a short game mode that actually lets skilled players win with their skill.","replies":[{"poster":"Evangele","date":"2019-08-31T06:31:03.540+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:267}} Spooky when long dead threads come back from the grave!\n\nWhile the art of thread necromancy can be useful in some cases, this unfortunately, is not one of those times.

I didn't blame RNG for losing or a teammate that didn't know who play for the Rift Herald/Drake/Scuttler. It just got over it since getting items faster meant I got to have fun with a full build on a champion I picked in a match that lasted within 15 mins because the game was designed to be fast, unlike Summoner's Rift where the build pace is slower. It always bothered me that I'd pick a champ I wanted to play only to get shut down without any hope of getting my build even remotely started.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Khristophoros","date":"2018-06-16T16:09:51.810+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"its fast its fun","replies":[]},{"poster":"Danjeng","date":"2018-06-16T20:57:14.539+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":2,"body":"Dominion is the best game mode.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Asteraki","date":"2018-11-22T20:18:43.360+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"BRING BACK DOMINION","replies":[{"poster":"likeanepicbau5","date":"2018-12-02T15:53:41.551+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=iviaess,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=E8xv4Eke,comment-id=000f,timestamp=2018-11-22T20:18:43.360+0000)\n>\n> BRING BACK DOMINION\n\nIt makes me so happy to see that someone still cares enough to comment on this","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Elkington VI","date":"2018-06-18T06:21:16.612+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Either Dominion or Ascension should be permanent.
