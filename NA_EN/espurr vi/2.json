Ascended, phoenixes, nine-tailed foxes, guardians, gods, are not unique to League of Legends. They can be found in a number of other games.\nYordles, on the other hand, are exclusive to League of Legends.\nThis isn't to make the game PC. I couldn't care less about the game being PC or not. This is more to give more lore to the yordles. What intelligent species do we have in League? Humans, Voidborn monsters (which have a nice amount of lore), spirits/not-living-or-dead-things (again, a good amount of lore), and yordles. Each of the races I've mentioned, aside from yordles has a sense of species. Black and White for humans, Xer'sai and other forms of voidborn monsters, spirits of death (kindred), spirits of life (Bard), and spirits inbetween (Mordekaiser, Karthus, etC) but for Yordles, we only have furry males and purple females, and those are just the gender differences.

Asking for a new female champion isn't some attack on masculinity or whatever some of these people are trying to make it out to be.  Yordles are a tiny, unique race to LoL.  The OP is just asking for an expansion of this race in order to enrich their lore and our knowledge of them.  We already have a variety of male yordles, so it would be nice to see more of the same in female yordles.  Like, it's more of a, \"If we're going to make a new yordle, why not make it a female of a different 'yordle' race since it's never been done before and would expand and enrich our knowledge of the yordle race as a whole?\" as opposed to  \"OMG! WE NEED MORE FEMALES NOW BECAUSE THERE NEEDS TO BE JUST AS MANY FEMALES AS MALES AND WHAAAH WHAAAH WHAAH!\"  For some reason, a few of you seem to think it's the latter instead of the former.  I don't see why you guys are jumping down the OP's throat over a small, innocent suggestion.  We have many male yordles of many different appearances and, in the case of Gnar, even a different subspecies.  All the female yordles more or less look alike, as if they could be related.  It would be nice that, if a new yordle was introduced, it showed some of the variety (if any) that is present in female yordles.  It's not for the sake of feminism or inclusion or whatever; it's for the sake of learning more about the yordle race and adding something new to the game.  No one is saying there shouldn't be male phoenixes or any of the other things some of you listed; there's no reason to act as if a request for a female yordle is a demand that new male champions shouldn't be made.  So, just chill out about it.\n\nPersonally, yordles are my favorite race in LoL, and I would love to see more variety in them.  This includes different subspecies of yordles and more female yordles, since most existing yordles are male and seemingly of a similar subspecies (except Gnar).  Suggesting a female yordle is doing nothing more than asking for a variety that doesn't currently exist in the race. It's not some kind of attack against any other race or gender combination.  There's literally no reason to be offended or insulted or defensive over this suggestion.","replies":[{"poster":"Espurr VI","date":"2016-02-02T01:41:03.476+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"This","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sukishoo","date":"2016-01-30T22:43:56.335+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":4,"body":"Amumu isn't a Yordle, they changed that.","replies":[{"poster":"Senteth","date":"2016-01-31T14:08:53.290+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":6,"body":"No they did not.\n\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/ZO2PBZhl-amumu-is-still-a-yordle-and-i-can-prove-it","replies":[{"poster":"Sukishoo","date":"2016-01-31T17:31:04.955+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeah they did http://www.surrenderat20.net/2014/12/1217-pbe-update.html","replies":[{"poster":"Senteth","date":"2016-02-01T14:15:47.185+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There was nothing in that lore to suggest that Amumu is no longer a Yordle.\nYes the man telling the story refers to him a child, but unless you're trying to say that Yordles can't have children then that doesn't mean anything.
