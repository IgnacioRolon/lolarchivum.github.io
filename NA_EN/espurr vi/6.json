It feels really overloaded on him, and also quite out of place.

Tryndamere has hit ult and yi has his alpha strike to completely mitigate damage.  Fiora has her parry and spammable Q. \n\nAnother thing to note is that these champions all have escapes as well, while yasuos only mobility is tied to minions, with a long ass cooldown on champions.  \n\nIf you want to remove his windwall make his ult do triple current damage and make him invulnerable, that's literally the kind of compensation you would have to give him.  \n\nPeople are going to yell out delete yasuo, but if we deleted every champ in the game because people hated them, not even aatrox would still be a champion.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Best KhaZix Void","date":"2015-12-29T03:12:31.950+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"he's not actually overloaded.","replies":[]},{"poster":"IronwallJackson","date":"2015-12-28T23:53:09.309+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm shocked by the reasonable, correct answers.\n\nKudos to you, lads.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dreadlocks","date":"2015-12-28T23:49:46.368+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think shyvana does too much damage given shes a tank, and talon's burst lacks counter play..
