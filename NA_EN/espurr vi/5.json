I'm pretty sure that every one of them is above average.\n\nThen think of his passive. His passive gives him health every time his ADC kills a creep. He gets health sustain from literally doing nothing. I can't think of any other support that shares such a thing.\n\nHis Q, along with being a solid enhanced AA, grants him bonus AD and decreases the AD of the enemy ADC. In all-ins or trades this could be a big deal. In the early game I think this is actually huge, to be honest.\n\nHis W doesn't benefit his carry per say, it only helps him close the distance, deal more damage, and sustain himself better, but it's a good ability in general.\n\nHis E is stronk as fuck. Cuts off escapes, slows the enemy, pushes them closer so you can quickly get in their grill with frozen domain. I'd imagine you could also use it to take the enemy ADC out of the fight if they are a bit too far away from the Leona that just went in on your ADC.\n\nHis R though... imagine Leona coming in on your carry with her E. Then imagine Trundle making that Leona barely tankier than the ADC while making himself almost impossible to kill, and draining her health rapidly. Subjugate seems like it would seriously counter tanky all-in supports like Nautilus, Leona, or Alistar. \n\nWith all this said, I might actually try Trundle support in the near future. It seems neat.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lugg","date":"2015-07-29T07:13:21.694+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The boost to his ult was game changing.
