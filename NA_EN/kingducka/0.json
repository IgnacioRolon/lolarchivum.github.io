Do you work for Riot? Interesting. So you're saying everyone has a differing opinion as to where the line is between \"staunchly defending oneself\" against a troll, and \"contributing to the problem via retaliation\".\n\nI don't work for Riot, but I can already see where this is going. To answer your question yes depending on who you ask you'll get a different response as to where they feel you cross the line from defending yourself to becoming part of the problem. Overall though both Riot and the community agree that retaliation of any kind is not okay. You can defend yourself so long as it's done in a respectful manner.\n\n> And I never cherry picked any line in my conversation; I am **replying** to yours, since you used that line as an example.\n\nUm yes, you did. You said and I quote: \n\n>How is saying \"open mid\" bad, when your whole team is agreeing to it?\n\nAnd in the Reform Card you even said: \n\n>KingDucka: open mid pls\n\nSo again, you were the one that brought up the \"open mid\" line in this conversation of ours here, so trying to claim that I was the one that brought it up first when in fact I wasn't won't work.\n\n> It seems to me from all your posts and replies in this thread, you just enjoy creating conflict by insisting your opinion/way is the only, right way.\n\nMe? No. You? Maybe so. If you look through my posts in this thread you can see that I'm only trying to explain why certain things are or aren't okay as well as Riot's stance on certain things as well. I also never claimed that it was my way or the highway, and if I did give that impression then I apologize. That being said though however, unless you're trying to start a fight here I fail to see what I would have to gain by having that kind of attitude here in this thread.\n\n> Again let me ask, do you work for Riot? Do you speak for Riot? No? Then your opinion is solely that, your sole opinion, as you stated yourself \"you'll get a different response depending on who you ask\".\n\nNo I don't work for Riot, but you did get a Riot response (which is rare) explaining to you why you got your ban. It may just be my opinion, but whose opinions are you going to listen to? Those of the Riot-hating banned troll ragers or those of Riot and people who are trying to help others understand why they got punished and how they can avoid it in the future?\n\n> Leave me alone, troll.\n\nIf I'm a troll because I didn't give you the Yesman answers that you wanted then so be it. You've been given the information as to why you got banned so you can either take them to heart and listen to them to avoid being banned again or you can just ignore them, keep acting like you did in the Reform Card and get permabanned, the choice is up to you and you alone.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Prandine","date":"2016-01-30T01:12:16.457+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=KingDucka,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=GcP6Y3u5,comment-id=0003000000000001000100000000000000010000000000010000,timestamp=2016-01-30T00:04:51.614+0000)\n>\n> Now you're just getting into semantics with it.

Like you said the community is what determines what is acceptable and what is not, and as far as I am aware the consensus on opening mid is that it is fine as long as the entire team agrees to it.

Never have I ever censored myself, and yet all these years I've gotten a Honor ribbon (which I lost at some later point) and the Sportsmanlike Conduct icon.\nMy secret? During these 5 years I have lost my temper like 5? 10 times?

You can let them know politely.\n\"Dude you've died 4 times and you still try to engage and duel... I think you're smart enough to understand that doing that is very stupid. So please stay back, play safe and don't put us in a more difficult position. Just farm if you can, and let us try to carry this.\"  \n\nRiot *never* said that you can't express things like anger or disappointment in chat. Hell, a friend of mine broke up with his boyfriend and asked his team to not pick on him even if he lost the lane, because he was so upset that he was prone to raging. His team respected that and they even had a toxic player.\nYou can tell your team you're angry or sad or you just wanna surrender already cause it's a lost cause, you just have to be polite and respectful.\n\n\"**OH MY GOD YOU NOOBS FUCK YOU IM AFK THIS IS GG I REPORT U ALL YOU PIECES OF SHIT JUST SURR OR I LEAVE**\" <--- No. I'd report you.\n\"Guys, we're all playing like shit and we're _really_ behind... if we're gonna continue playing this badly we might as well give up.
