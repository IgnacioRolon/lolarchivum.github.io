We&rsquo;ve heard players&rsquo; laments about catch-up experience and taken them to heart. We don&rsquo;t like the overall potency of catch-up mechanics available.  Players that establish early game leads should not feel cheated out of their advantage by mostly invisible systems that are difficult to intuit. At the same time, these mechanics serve the important role of making it so games don&rsquo;t seem over at the outset, and often drive a lot of action.  With that said, in most even-ish games, we expect our changes to have minimal actual and perceived impact.  \n\nNot going to get too technical or specific about the changes, but wanted to touch on some highlights that indicate our direction:\n\n**Catch-up experience is only granted on Large or Epic Monsters**.  The amount per large monster kill is up, but the overall generated catch-up experience is going to be down substantially. Equally as important, there&rsquo;s a clear path for an opponent to keep their enemy down further: don&rsquo;t give them access to large monsters.\n\n**Wolf camp at level 1 will grant a full level**.  This was a casualty of there being too much experience in the jungle at the start of S2017.  We&rsquo;re hoping some routes are opened up as wolves are more relevant and razorbeaks are less so (catch-up experience changes make mini-razorbeaks no longer the only optimal XP path).\n\n**Rolling back the bonus teamwork catch-up experience we introduced in 7.4**.  In 7.4 we introduced some measures so that players that were substantially lower level than their team would get a boost in experience.  Upon reflection, this acted more as a snowball mechanic than it served its original intent to provide a safety net for experience starved roles. \n\nhttp://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/6.24.1/img/item/3252.png **Poacher&rsquo;s Dirk buffs**.  The Poacher&rsquo;s Dirk no longer has a cooldown between enemy camps stolen, allowing for quicker stacking. For most of League&rsquo;s history, counter-jungling&rsquo;s main purpose has been to set the enemy jungler way behind. This is one exploration into a world where counter-jungling gets the successful jungler ahead in a meaningful way.\n\n**Jungle camps are all worth the same creep score**. One consistent issue in judging the impact of a jungler v. jungler match-up is that creep score can mean vastly different things. This is especially true if one champion specializes in single target camps while the other is an AoE monster.  Now each camp in its entirety will grant 4 creep score, which generally matches the camps&rsquo; value and should provide for easier comparison of a jungler to their direct opponent.\n\nWith these set of changes (and a large number of supporting ones), players should feel like their leads gained are more meaningful. Particularly junglers should be able to flex their advantages into feeling they have a larger impact on winning the game. In addition to being more impactful, it should be understandable how and why a lead exists and less of a mystery when an opponent overcomes their early disadvantage to draw even.  We&rsquo;ll be watching closely over the next couple of patches and ensure a variety of roles still feel like they can contribute from the jungle, and that the jungler is engaging frequently with enemy champions.","replies":[{"poster":"LUNARY CHAP","date":"2017-10-24T22:28:34.608+0000","up_votes":981,"down_votes":45,"body":"\"Jungle camps are all worth the same creep score.

If you can't track the enemy jungler by their creep score, that means you need to be more reliant on deep vision and invades, which is considerably riskier than bringing up the score screen. Tracking the enemy jungler becomes more difficult, effectively increasing the skill required to do so effectively.\n\nThis just brings back to mind all the conversations about how buff timers were gonna ruin the jungle and then, surprise surprise, they didn't.","replies":[{"poster":"OAK Arkel","date":"2017-10-25T09:34:02.430+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":11,"body":"NA comment.","replies":[{"poster":"OAK Arkel","date":"2017-10-25T09:44:19.095+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":5,"body":"How the fuck a gold 5 who played 70% of normal games this season can be so overconfident in front of a triple challenger Jungler main ? o_O","replies":[{"poster":"Gixia","date":"2017-10-25T09:50:41.663+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":10,"body":"It's actually super easy: I have access to forbidden knowledge that indicates Mr. Challenger Jungler main is secretly human.","replies":[{"poster":"OAK Arkel","date":"2017-10-25T10:01:11.233+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"It does not explain why you would know the game better than him ?

Even Faker makes mistakes. Even SKT can lose 2 games to Misfits. A challenger player isn't Jesus, and their knowledge of the game is not flawless. Just because somebody is a better player doesn't mean that everything they say is automatically right 100% of the time.\n\nMidi Chapi made two statements and gave no explanation to back up either one. You're taking what he says as accepted fact with nothing to actually back up what his claims other than 'he's a good player'. But as I just said, even good players can fuck up and lose to someone who's worse than them.\n\nHe says that jungle tracking is a huge part of being a good jungler. I agree with this statement. He also says that removing it will reduce the skillcap of the jungle. I disagree with this statement. Unlike Midi Chapi, I actually gave an explanation to back up my opinion. I'll give it again: Just because a jungler can't be reliably tracked by their CS score doesn't mean they can't be tracked *at all*. You can still track a jungler by getting vision of their jungle, and knowing where the enemy jungler is will always be important information so that your lanes know when they can be aggressive and when to pull back, or when you can try to take an objective or make a gank of your own. The skills required to be a good jungler will change, but they will not be reduced. They'll likely be increased because going deep into the jungle to get vision is considerably more risky than simply hitting the tab button, and good junglers will know when and where to do it, and how to coordinate their invades with their team, while bad junglers will just get caught and killed. It will take *more skill* to track the enemy jungler when you can't just rely on their CS to do it.\n\nDo you disagree? That's fine, you're free to do so. I too am human afterall, and thus can fuck up and make mistakes... but if your only argument is 'lol, you're gold', then I'll kindly ask that you go watch WE, one of the top 4 teams at Worlds, try and chase a goddamned Singed, something which even a gold player like myself knows is stupid.\n\nEDIT: Got one of SKT and WE's games mixed up and had to correct myself.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"i cant move wtf","date":"2017-10-25T03:53:35.031+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Midi Chapi,realm=EUW,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=24K8ORZQ,comment-id=0012,timestamp=2017-10-24T22:28:34.608+0000)\n> Please, you really need to revert that, jungle tracking is a HUGE part of being a good jungler.

If you see them show up top side with 9 cs you could assume they did raptors + red + scuttle.  If anything I think this makes tracking more possible at all stages of the game.  In mid game if you make a mental note of their cs, if they don't show up on the map again and they appear with +16 cs that would mean they cleared 4/6 of their camps, and if you are keeping up with their timers you could very well deduce what camps those most likely were.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Salron","date":"2017-10-24T21:39:51.751+0000","up_votes":70,"down_votes":11,"body":"How are we supposed to keep track of what camps the enemy has cleared then?

As you say, you get his cs number because he showed on the map. it's, and this is a stretch example but it may prove my point, taking his botside jungle because he showed top. is that not just abusing him showing on the map? As i see it, it is a mental skill that should remain, as it helps those who have the awareness to see when the jungler appears (reason being if you count the cs when he had showed, but hasn't shown for 20, its naturally very different. it would reward you if you noticed when he showed as well as where later on). While in theory i see where you are coming from, as it makes sense, tracking by sticking your head in the enemy jungle sometimes, its not that you dont do this, but you, by paying attention, doing some mental math, and some deductive reasoning based on location, minimizes risk based on your ability to count and calculate the camps done. Some may say it is good that the risk can no longer be minimized, but i feel like jungle turns into mind games at a high level and slight advantages as a whole, and the idea behind minimizing risks and maximizing rewards is kinda the role as a whole.\n\nI've also seen how some people say this is akin to buff timer changes, which i can see their perspective as well. The major difference i see is that for one, it doesn't affect the whole route or entire jungle, which is my own personal take on it, but that could have nothing to do with it. i also believe that buff timers, since they're only given if you saw them take it. it doesnt really affect too much, and i'll admit, a lot of junglers overreacted. \n\nRight now, junglers counting cs and calculating camps isn't just to be like, oh we can counterjungle these camps, but it's also similar to following a laner's roam, but between junglers. instead of seeing which direction they went and looking at where they could be going, we look at the jungler's cs and determine where he could be going, based on his route. I see it as an skill that needs to be refined (to allow you to do the math while keeping track of everything else) and learned over time (due to game knowledge) similar to how some challenger laners can keep track of enemy exp through minions, which is a skill, but also just math and game knowledge, just like counting cs to tell which camps.","replies":[{"poster":"Basshead","date":"2017-10-25T20:09:45.054+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"I appreciate your thoughtful rational reply. I will say, I'm still convinced that cs counting is NOT an interesting skill for League of Legends. I still think that \"tracking\" a jungler should involve your team's units' vision and the usage of vision tools and abilities. Since League of Legends is an information incomplete game, information has a value, and therefore accordingly, information should have a cost (whether it be time, resources, cooldowns, unit risk, etc). \n\nFor instance, imagine a RTS game like Age of Empires.  Imagine being able to deduce enemy's location in fog of war, not because you used your units effectively, but rather  you used games scores, which are tracked by a central game counter. Is that fair? Should players be taught this in a game play tutorial? Without that game counter, you could not deduce this advantageous information. Sure, this creates a meta game among advanced players where they try to minimize showing themselves so the enemy can't see their score and gather information, but that meta game just supports a play style of avoiding interaction with the enemy. While there's nothing wrong with being sneaky, when the game grants advantages for free or encourages players to avoid each other just because of a game score, the game play becomes lame, IMO. \n\nIn ANY case, why not use your champion's field of vision, vision tools, and vision abilities to gather information and make decisions? Isn't it more rewarding and fair when players use what's provided in the game rather than on the scoreboard?\n\nIn my opinion, THIS video highlights perfectly what I think jungle tracking should be like: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYE40oohxb4  Watch Zirene breakdown SKT's coordinated team effort to shutdown the enemy jungler, using their skills, tools, and knowledge IN GAME.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Mysticman89","date":"2017-10-24T21:20:18.567+0000","up_votes":23,"down_votes":0,"body":"So how do partial camps work in terms of creep score? \n\nIf I steal a single mini-chicken from razorbeaks, do I get no cs for it?

As someone who capped at Diamond 4, I've only begun mastering it. It adds to the experience of jungling. It increases the ability one has to be truly skilled or truly indifferent about the game, which I think is great.\n\nHowever!\n\nDoes jungle tracking solely rely on knowing the CS count? Of course not! If a Lee Sin shows up top at 3:20, what route did he take? Well, unless he's been AFK for 30 seconds or got help from his support half the route, he's done Buff - Wolves - Buff - Toplane Gank. There you go. And if you're _really_ good, you can even tell exactly when those camps respawn. You don't need a CS count for that. It's now even harder to track someone in the jungle. But it's not at all impossible. So I heavily disagree with the idea that this change would _lower_ the skillcap on jungling. In my mind, if people were to complain, it ought to be because it _increases_ it.\n\nAnother problem is that even if you don't know the jungle route someone took and you didn't look at the timing, you have a fairly good idea of what the route was. You know most skirmish junglers go for a standard route with 5 CS, and you know most scaling junglers go for a full clear unless they see they are desperately needed for a (counter)gank. So even if you had no information on the jungler's CS at all and learning the time it takes to clear certain camps, you would still have a very good indication of what route someone took. This is all aided by the fact that some junglers are better at doing one camp over the other, meaning if only one camp was taken, you can guess which one it was.\n\nAs you can tell, there are boatloads of ways to infer or at least guess what camps a jungler cleared, only one of which is to do the CS arithmetic whenever the jungler shows himself on the map. The change caused by evening out the CS scores is marginal.\n\nOne last thing is that the cost of this in my mind minor change to how jungle tracking is done must also be weighed up against the benefit of allowing the millions and millions of players that are not in the highest percentile of competitive play an easy way to compare jungler CS. I think the clarity from this for 99.5% of the playerbase vastly outweighs what I think is not that bad of a change for jungle tracking.\n\nI'd say: even out the CS score.","replies":[{"poster":"Melvinizzle","date":"2017-10-29T02:45:06.251+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I've gone through plenty of points in my boards profile for this stuff if you're interested in the counter points please do take a read.\n\n\nYou're point about the weighted benefits at the end is the only thing I don't think I've already touched on elsewhere fully but to take a crack at it since I'm far far gone in the camp of this change is a horrifying nightmare due to the lowering of the skill cap (written recently on the boards profile) to the benefit of the very newest players.\n\nRemoving the ability for exact (or close) tracking is one I recently went over in a point arguing that the other methods stated should not have to be a replacement when in the current system they are supplemental to the counting CS (and even now you rarely find a situation where you perfectly play against the enemy jungler's path).

Whereas the only foreseeable \"benefits\" are that junglers who are proactive gankers can’t be punished (going against the buff to poachers along with the logic behind the catch up exp changes) and is low-key giving toxic players another way to say how great they did at 1v9ing and blaming others.\n\nIf you don’t understand the mechanic of tracking the enemy jungler so ignorance is the preferred route please watch some guides, google it or get a coach (myself included) and understand it then you’ll see regardless of role you can use this to outplay junglers in a noticeable way.\n\n\nThe catchup exp change is a different thing, I initially hated it for the Lee Sin/Elise/Graves exclusive meta that ensued for far too long however I’m now in the camp (which shouldn’t be worth 4CS) of that it’s good for the game in a toned down state since a completely farm/safe jungle is almost as toxic for the game for different reasons since it shuts out the aggressive junglers almost completely along with other stuff.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SuperPewPew","date":"2017-10-25T02:43:24.089+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot Sotere,realm=NA,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=24K8ORZQ,comment-id=,timestamp=2017-10-24T21:07:58.424+0000)\n\n> **Rolling back the bonus teamwork catch-up experience we introduced in 7.4**.

Now each camp in its entirety will grant 4 creep score, which generally matches the camps&amp;rsquo; value and should provide for easier comparison of a jungler to their direct opponent.\n\n@RiotSotere, whose conundrum is this? Consistent issue for whom? The analysts who talk about creep score tracking? The coaches who train people to do it? It's a valuable and HIGHLY informative tool and it's being considered for the reductionist role of a score board? Don't we already have that in the form of seeing enemy items?\n\nAnd, let's just cut to brass tacks. There are the players who don't need or want this change, because they are able to track the pulse of the game without some arbitrary jungle camp cs and there are the players who won't care. They lose duels to enemy champions that are 2 levels and 30cs ahead of them and you think they will appreciate jungle cs being rounded? Huh?\n\nAnd that's the other thing. The AoE monster you mentioned will have **_more gold and higher cs _** because the camps they are clearing are worth more gold...and cs...Krugs=160g, Raptors=112g, Gromp=86g. This change makes it more inaccurate for your scenario because the champions that have cleared 4 raptors camps and 3 Krug camps by 10:00 are not merely 28cs ahead of the enemy. They are 54 ahead. They are not 7camps*100g=700g ahead. They are 928g ahead. The reason for the change doesn't even hold water.\n\nAnd as to arguments by @Gixia that removing cs tracking increases the jungler skill cap by requiring more deep wards, I must simply say, \"How?\" They are not mutually exclusive activities. And, even more importantly for the sake of arguing the state of competitive macro, one informs the other. Deep wards can tell you whether they are skipping camps for more expedient gank routes and, with other information (like enemy HP), you can make calls to try to catch them at a camp you know they haven't cleared. When they pop up and have X cs in bot lane and they had X-4 before, you know they just did wolves/Gromp. You can steal raptors and...wait for it...place a deep ward. More safely. Cause...you know...you gained more information.\n\nLimiting risks is one of the pillars of competitive gaming. You think it's, what? Brave to face check enemy fog of war to place wards? Knowing none of the enemy team is where you will ward is a benefit. Even better, knowing the enemy jungler cleared a top side camp and is ganking bottom tells you were they will likely be in a minute or two. There is just SO MUCH depth available to the cs score tracking and you're missing it, friend.","replies":[]}]}
