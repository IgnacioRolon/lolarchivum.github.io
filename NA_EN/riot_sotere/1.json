Wanted to touch base here so none of the changes felt like they came out of left field and so players have a centralized place to give feedback over the next week or so.  \n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------  \n\n**Goals: **\n\n* Reduce early lane pressure from junglers\n* Increase the number of jungle v. jungle interactions in the early game\n* Encourage variation in optimal pathing\n* Reduce mana restraints as a hard blocker for champions that want to jungle\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------  \n**High level tactics:**\n\n* There is now only one Rift Scuttler on the map at any given time. The spawn location will be determined randomly, with a lot of notice given ahead of time to where it&#039;s going to spawn.  Its rewards are also substantially higher than on Live\n* Jungle experience is down early game: most notably this means that routes to level (3) are not as simple as going Buff -&gt; Camp -&gt; Buff. Instead, you hit 3 with the following routes:\n *  2 standard camps and a Rift Scuttler\n * 3 camps if you include a Krug clear\n *  4 standard camps\n* Talisman will return substantially more mana regen based on your missing mana as you clear the jungle\n* Runic Echoes will get a face lift to make it more mage friendly\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------  \n\n**Rift Scuttler Specific Changes:**\n\n* Base Health :: 800 &gt;&gt;&gt; 1200\n* Health Scaling :: 800 +200 (after first spawn) +60  per level &gt;&gt;&gt; 1200 + 25 per level \n* Experience Granted :: 10 &gt;&gt;&gt; 170\n* Respawn Time :: 180 &gt;&gt;&gt; 150\n* [NEW] Now only one exists on the map at a time\n* Initial Spawn Time :: 2:15 &gt;&gt;&gt; 1:40\n* Gold Reward :: 70 &gt;&gt;&gt; 100\n* Mana Reward On Death :: 10-40 (based off missing Mana percent) &gt;&gt;&gt; 50-200 (based off missing Mana percent)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------   \n\nWill be jumping into this thread throughout the day when I have some spare time to talk about the high level direction. There&#039;s a lot of supporting changes for our goals, so the plan is not to get into the weeds until you have the full changelist available on PBE. **As always, the changes that first hit PBE are tentative and subject to change.** If you feel like a major element is not being considered or neglected, please let me know!  We know this is going to impact a wide range of champions in the jungle (that&#039;s the intent in large part), and we&#039;ll address major outliers and be on the lookout for others negatively impacted.  I&#039;m excited for you guys to test it out next week on PBE. :)","replies":[{"poster":"Tormentula","date":"2018-04-27T20:15:43.571+0000","up_votes":407,"down_votes":21,"body":"ugh I really don't like that change at all... \n\nIts going to feel super snowbally/coinflippy with that scuttle crab, meaning you can't plan ahead on what pathing you'll take because you may or may not be getting scuttle level 2.

It's a bit expected that the change is contentious and won't fit all jungle playstyles. The aim of making junglers interact with each other has been debated at great length.  On the one hand, not all of the JvJ interactions feel particularly rich (you get to that below in more length).  On the other, encouraging more PvP and success based on how you play around other champions seems like a big win to me.  Right now that PvP primarily comes at the cost of heavily modifying the lane phase of one or a few laners.  The hope here is that the JvJ interaction has some nuance and tension that is closer to the champ v. champ interactions in lane than it is to a PvE experience. And at the same time, laners get to have more meaningful match-ups against each other because the path to success of 'camp one lane' isn't always optimal.  \n\n> Its going to feel super snowbally/coinflippy with that scuttle crab, meaning you can&#x27;t plan ahead on what pathing you&#x27;ll take because you may or may not be getting scuttle level 2.

This also makes invading like the level 2 wolves cheese all the more toxic and uncounterable as that basically gives them a camp, your flash, and their scuttle pretty much free early levels. \n\nPlanning ahead point:  We are asking you to somewhat reevaluate your plans/pathing as the game goes on.  That's an intended benefit of the system that will cause some friction.  Being able to plan out your first five minutes of pathing in the loading screen leads to a rather stale gameplay experience.  Not trivializing your point, as it's probably the main negative point of feedback I've received throughout testing this: jungle players highly value setting up a plan for the game in advance.  Then we kind of modify our formula based on our success and eventually get to a few standard game plans that work.  This skill test is going to be diminished, hopefully in favor of skill tests of reactive planning and how to interact with or avoid the enemy jungler, as you see fit.  \n\n> IMO you shouldn&#x27;t do the random 1 scuttle on the map, that just limits playstyles and makes things was more complicated. Keep both scuttles with the change, IMO that&#x27;s fine, but contesting one RNG scuttle (or even non-rng) just seems unhealthy and unfun and less skill expressive and more &quot;what champ gets this fastest&quot; into the slipperly slope of &quot;nerf early junglers but wait tanks are faster clearers, w.e we&#x27;ll leave them alone!&quot;\n\nWe're probably just going to have to agree to disagree on this point.  I don't find the contesting over early Scuttle less fun and skill expressive than the current jungle meta. It certainly creates some swings because there's a battle over resources. Think that's more interesting than eking out a small creep lead due to slightly more optimal pathing.\n \n> If you wanted to fix the jungle, you should&#x27;ve just mass nerfed a lot of junglers to be strong/weak depending on what their clear strengths are.

I think its fine if a champ for early ganking is early gankiing.. but right now it feels like a lot of champs that play for late game are monsters early game with how healthy and fast they clear, which was previously a weakness of theirs. \n\nMy original iterations looked kind of like this: I slowed down and made a lot of junglers less healthy early on. There were some benefits: laners felt less pressure.  The downside was a lot of junglers returned to PvE as much as possible.  So my aim shifted from dramatically slowing them down to instead reducing some of their early spike strength compared to laners and giving them outlets to interact with the other jungler.  Then let them grow a lead or deficit more relevant and related to their counterpart.  \n\nOn the Warwick point: he's pretty solidly an early game jungler.  He's arguably been overtuned for awhile so he maintains that strength later into the game than he probably should.  The constant pressure from junglers isn't really specific to just a handful of junglers, though: it's a pretty standard strategy from most. \n\n> I liked when early game junglers camped and their weakness was falling behind later but if they got ahead they could carry the early game for a team advantage... now tanks do that but better, more reliably, and faster without falling off.

More downtime early game for a jungler sounds pretty painful. Well, rather, can say it is since we tested versions like that.  As per the tank pressure I don't have anything too meaningful to contribute.  I disagree on how skewed in their favor this current system/balance is.  \n\n> Oh and how will this work: {{champion:203}}\n\nRiot Wrekz is working on some small QoL work for her.

However, because of the exp nerfs in the jungle we won't be able to even contest the scuttler without strong laners. If we die early game and the enemy jungler decides(which they will 100% of the time if they are above gold) counterjungle, we will effecively have lost our \"lane\". \n\nThe only period in the game that junglers are stronger than laners is at lvl 3 in which they can apply pressure on the map, after that we already fall behind on exp and come mid game we have to start surrendering our camps to our laners. I'm really upset about these changes because all junglers are already reliant on their laners*cough adc, support, mid cough* but will be even more reliant on them now. I don't like the way you all are saying that there will be \"decently impactful jungle changes\" instead of just saying that you're nerfing the whole role and all late game junglers especially. Also, what's to say that the meta doesn't shift to said laners just taking the scuttler for themselves? If its so strong and you already will make it to such a contested early game objective then it makes perfect sense for laners to also fight for it (push lane and then take scuttler). And if you are all just hoping that they care about the jungler then you're probably not playing the same game as me tbh.\n\nI thought S7 was the worst season for jungle but this might actually take the cake... If you want to make jungle healthy define the role as a whole and see how the different champions function within the role. Are they doing more than they should(Warwick, Khazix, Xin Zhao, Evelynn, Jax)? What should they be doing and how can one put them in line with their intended purpose? Doing this will just change the current imbalances to another problem and it will undoubtedly be the biggest jungle problem yet. You seriously can't have the most impactful role(taking objectives and applying map pressure) into being the weakest role, it should be a favored role like Mid and Adc.","replies":[]},{"poster":" Subb in Alpha","date":"2018-04-27T21:08:18.808+0000","up_votes":26,"down_votes":1,"body":"*Increase the number of jungle v. jungle interactions in the early game* This point is already fixed, because of the insane respawntimers, you don´t have anything to do as a jungler if you can´t gank any lane.

As a support player, removing Sightstone means I can't guarantee I get sufficient wards until after 15 minutes, in the case that I'm playing a Relic support, and my ADC doesn't let me last-hit, and the laners on my teams already didn't ward. Now junglers don't have an item that gives wards, and now have lost 1/2 of the monsters that grant vision. It's madness. This kind of awful design guarantees binary play, where lack of vision means either 100% passive play, or 100% active play, especially in the first 15 minutes of the game, when supports often won't have ward active.) \n\nNever mind how this will eliminate non-early game junglers from the competitive pool AGAIN. If you can't get level 3 fast or win a duel at level 2, you're basically useless with this change. And you keep having to restructure the jungle because you made the buff camps be the center of jungle pathing by making them so strong, but you don't want them to be the center of pathing, and you can't figure out the really simple cause-and-effect that sets up. It's like when you made baron give extra stats, or dragon give a bunch of gold; players and teams will (generally) beeline to the most obvious, immediate bonus, and center their gameplay around that. You don't remove focus on buffs by removing another valuable monster: you weaken the buffs or bring them more in line with other camps in terms of XP, or make the XP less to make up for how valuable the buff is, so that junglers who are better against one monster at a time get buffs to help them clear easier, while junglers with better 1vX monster clear get more XP as a bonus, instead. \n\nIt feels like the people responsible for jungle changes over the 5 years I've been playing LoL are people who don't understand economics, specifically opportunity cost. Because, ultimately, that's what early game jungle pathing is. You weigh the possible actions you can take, and, ideally, act in the way that grants you the most possible power in that time, whether that's XP, gold, objectives, etc. The reason buff-camp-buff is prevalent is because 1. the efficiency of the route means the least time spent doing nothing on first clear, 2. lack of viable alternatives (specifically, lack of efficient secondary camps and lack of vision security around objectives making early dragons a coin flip(unless you pull bot lane, and lose them pressure/tower/gold and XP), especially after this change), and 3. Most junglers who are relevant in later stages of the game require buffs to clear early on, due to the way they scale, or they otherwise fall levels behind and instantly lose.  \n\nChanges like this one show that there is a clear lack of understanding as to the role of the jungle by the very people designing it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Solari Fortune","date":"2018-04-27T20:43:00.687+0000","up_votes":24,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel this will just force upon us early game junglers who will just kill the enemy jungle level 2 over scuttle and basically have jungle lead for most of the game","replies":[]},{"poster":"ProvidenceNox","date":"2018-04-27T21:07:42.057+0000","up_votes":25,"down_votes":2,"body":"Maybe if camps respawned quicker junglers would have more to manage instead of being almost forced to gank  lanes.

If two camps and rift scuttler give lvl 3 and 4 camps give lvl 3 then its worth roughly 2 camps of exp early game.  I understand the intention of trying to make junglers have to duel each other more often, but this change will just make it so you are more reliant on your laners to fight over rift scuttler.  If it spawns top side and your top/mid get shoved in early  there is zero early interaction you are 100% forced to give away rift scuttler and fall behind greatly, vice versa for bot spawn.  This just makes jungle more relient on laners for them to have early pressure.  With this change instead of junglers ganking laners, laners can gank the jungler when they are taking rift scuttler lol.\n\nThis change also doesn't  \"Encourage variation in optimal pathing\".  \n\nFor the second point, if rift scuttler spawns topside and your laners have early shove, you will just start bot side buff into chickens into buff then go and take rift scuttler with your laners that have early shove.  If the enemy jungler contests he dies because his laners don't have lane priority and can't roam.  The enemy jungler can't take your jungle and counter jungle you since you took your camp on the opposite side of the map already.  The enemy jungler gets fucked not because he pathed incorrectly, but because his LANERS don't have early lane priority.  \n\nReally bad change imo.  If you want to stop junglers from ganking early make camps worth more so they have an incentive to farm instead of ganking lanes.  Right now there is little incentive to farm your jungle if there is a gank opportunity because if the enemy jungle takes a camp from you, you don't fall behind.\n\nSo Riot nerfs how fast jungle camps spawn, makes them do more damage, and nerfs the gold and exp they give to stop junglers from farming and force them to gank.  Now instead of lowering spawn time or buffing the exp and gold they give.  Riot now wants to stop junglers from ganking, what are we suppose to do now?  It's like you didn't think about laners at all and their impact on roaming to the rift scuttler when you made this change.

Nunu needs to be on the radar for this change. Kindred will become SIGNIFICANTLY more predictable in her pathing early game.

Conversely the junglers that are on the weaker side early will be hit pretty hard by this. A personal sour point on this will be irelia who is already pathetic early even still with the changes on the PBE (i tested). \n\nWhat is going to have to happen is that all the early game junglers will have to have their power trimmed (I'm guessing we will be seeing a bunch of base AD decreases most likely. Another thing that could be done to better equalize would be to have the sustain from the jungle items improve as the champs have more % missing health. The ones who were already strong early will see little to no change while the weaker ones will gain a slight boost without actually making direct kit changes to the too strong or too weak ones, and their clear speeds remain generally unchanged since the damage isn't going up or down.\n\nFor runic echoes I wish you gave more info on what is planned. My thought would be to make it more similar to ludens and offer cdr, even 10% would be nice since jungle mages all rely on spells. More spell uptime means better overall jungle performance for mages. The other though is to give it an effect of simply increased magic damage to monsters and make it a mini Death cap (less AP and less % AP increase) but with aether wisp move speed. It removes the possible future of having AP scaling tanks taking it and building into tank items while enjoying the extra burst from the proc.
