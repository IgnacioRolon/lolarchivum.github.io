They refuse to listen to the community and only listen to pro teams on what they believe is annoying to go against so that champ/champs get nerfed to the ground so pros can go back to playing games against the same champs every game so nothing changes. where I&#039;m going with this is that the patch system is entirely based around competitive play and that is the wrong way to go about it as only a very small amount of the player base will play it to that degree","replies":[{"poster":"TempName74814","date":"2018-03-17T03:50:05.050+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"this game is officially ruined\" ~at least one person every single patch for the past 8 years ","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-03-17T02:33:48.468+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"At the end of the day, e-sports is where the money and exposure is, and very low-rank players just have to deal with it.\n\nRiot could focus on the majority of the playerbase (silver/gold) and break e-sports, but it would not fix anything - lower ELO is always going to be an unbalance mess due to how important coordination, teamwork and strategy are and how that changes the strength of some champs.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kythers","date":"2018-03-17T17:55:29.079+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:121}} \ndon't mind me, just stealthing past your patch notes","replies":[]},{"poster":"gabetheguy","date":"2018-03-17T17:54:02.190+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"a champ destroying you a few games in a row doesn't make them \"blatantly overpowered\". it makes you bad.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LegitBusinessman","date":"2018-03-17T03:47:14.927+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I AGREE.

You are stopped and shoved into a group of others captured just like you, terrible burning smell throughout the facility. One of the leaders then commands all of you at gunpoint to take your clothes off and you are about to take a shower.\n\nNaked, along with 50 others you are then shoved into a giant concrete room with a bunch of shower heads. The doors lock behind you. The showers then turn on, but instead of water, you hear a hissing noise. Next thing you know, you are choking, coughing, wheezing. Your lungs are literally on fire, you eyes are watery and burning hotter and hotter. You instinctively gasp for more air only to have your lungs filled with more burning, if feels like your skin is being scraped off by invisible razors as you helplessly fall to the floor, your muscles convulse, you start having a seizure , vomiting, then.....with one last twitch it's over. Your body lifeless on the floor.\n\nThe soldiers then move in again with gas masks, they drag your body with the others down a long very warm and humid hallway full of cremation ovens, where they shove body after body into their giant hell like fires where they are burned to ash, and become smoke that then floats up through a large pipe out of the facility and into the sky.\n\nThis was Nazi Germany WW2, where over 6 million (12k  per day) Jewish men, women and children died in a similar manner such as this.\n------\nNow, I want you to revise your post about your little first world problem, only this time try and be just a little more dramatic, will ya?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wild Geese","date":"2018-03-17T02:43:24.053+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"The obsession with pro play is a problem, I agree.\nWhile I agree the focus of buffs and nerfs should be for the professional scene, it does not have to be *everything*.\nYou can buff and nerf champions that the professionals don't really pick anyway, it does no damage and even (in the case of buffs), possibly bring a champion into the meta.\nEvery skill level should be considered and weighted.\nI don't want to see this turn into Dota where, all the most OP pub heroes would be untouched for years upon years until the pros finally did well with them.","replies":[]}]}
