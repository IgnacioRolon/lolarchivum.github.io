After they feed for like 3 times, you get this stupid message\n\n**\"Its just normal's it doesn't matter anyway\"**\n\nThis is by far the most stupidest type of mentality, who cares if its normal's or ranked. The behavior that you display in normal's is the exact same shit you'll do in ranked if you cant effectively \"practice and polish\" your skills in a normal, you think your just gonna show out in ranked?\n\nYou think people play sports without practices? You think faker was just born making everyone else looking like shit without playing a shit ton of normal's? \n\nSorry had to rant, after being held hostage by a troll duo..","replies":[{"poster":"DingleNutsMcGee","date":"2015-11-07T21:58:58.822+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im with the OP on this one.
