That's what \"name calling\" refers to - if you look it up in any dictionary you'll see phrases such as \"you are worthless\" and \"you're an ass hat\" given as common examples of name calling. It's understandable that you misunderstood because the definition of name calling isn't completely intuitive.\n\nWhat he really committed was a logically fallacious \"[argumentum ad hominem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hominem)\" but I didn't want to get into that since the terminology really isn't that important. If you're interested, my \"Goldilocks\" retort was actually a logically sound ad hominem as I was responding to his \"bad\" insult by showing that he is in fact a worse player than me based on rank - i.e. it was a more appropriate response than his. Perhaps I *could* have been more polite, but I didn't care to since he'd been rude to me.","replies":[{"poster":"LICENSED HOOKER","date":"2015-09-23T10:42:06.519+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well by golly, an OCE player thats two tiers above my elo.
