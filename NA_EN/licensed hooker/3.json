Anyway i don&#039;t know where to start to get better at him and believe me IVE TRIED, i used to spam {{champion:157}} games for full 1-2 days at the end I&#039;d  just get frustrated and quit hes just so fun to play in bots or 3v3, then you go on SR and get rekted top by virtually a feather or mid by every AP laner out there on top of being camped.\r\n\r\nAnd i know this because I&#039;ve feed many of games as {{champion:157}} top (** I don&#039;t say this to be proud, just honestly** ) and I&#039;ve also camped a lot of mid lane {{champion:157}} and i see how hard it is. \r\n\r\nTo me even though everyone hated {{champion:157}} and some 100% still do, coming from a silver player that plays with golds/plats i rarely see a good {{champion:157}} that can manage to not die to everything well except a friend &quot;BestYasuoOnEarth&quot; but i don&#039;t think that counts since he literally has {{champion:157}} in his name.\r\n\r\nAny mains got some tips and pointers for me?

He's on the stack of other \"basically ok\" champs that won't be seeing much, if any competitive play, but that's because the metagame doesn't especially favor him at the moment, and the loss of crit on Trinity Force hurt his bruiser build a lot, which was what allowed him to be a viable top laner.\n\nAs for tips, those are harder to give because I'm bad. Not that I'm unfamiliar with Yasuo, it's just that I can recognize I could be much better. Anyway, the best advice I can give is that managing your E is often the key to winning matchups, so you should max that over Q. That is, unless you're up against someone you **do not** want to engage on, in which case level your Q and focus on farming instead of fighting.","replies":[{"poster":"Spicy Rice","date":"2016-06-14T17:55:11.989+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually, regardless of the matchup, you need to max e. The mobility you gain from leveling it makes it the single most important ability to level as yasuo, as without your mobility, you have 0 outplay potential","replies":[{"poster":"IronwallJackson","date":"2016-06-14T18:07:02.391+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Let's put it this way. If you end up in a lane against, say, Xin, you don't want to use your E at all, because that makes you move towards him. Level your Q when it's unsafe to approach your opponent. It's also useful if your outplay potential is limited in some other way, such as an opponent whose kit doesn't give you much of a chance to outplay them, such as a Darius, Kayle, or Annie with her ult up.","replies":[{"poster":"Spicy Rice","date":"2016-06-14T18:51:36.056+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The reason you don't level up q is because all it does is give you an extra 10 (or is it 20) damage on your q. It doesn't decrease the cool down, or give you a better scaling or anything.\n\nMaxing e on the other hand gives you \n\n1. Lower cool down on the dash\n2. More damage on the dash\n3. Lower time between dashing on the same target.\n\n\nBy leveling your dash, you give yourself a better chance at survival as you will have greater opportunity to use your dash defensively.","replies":[{"poster":"IronwallJackson","date":"2016-06-14T19:43:26.872+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know the benefits of leveling your E over Q; I didn't start playing Yasuo yesterday. The issue at hand is that's primarily a harass/engagement tool and only a **situational** escape. It doesn't increase your chances of survival against the opponents I mentioned because more often than not, your dash won't bring you closer to the safety of your turret.","replies":[{"poster":"Spicy Rice","date":"2016-06-14T20:01:02.119+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You don't need to get closer to your turret to be safe.\n\n\nExample: you are against Darius in lane, and he's frozen the wave in the middle of the lane. You come up to cs, and he grabs you and slows you and is trying to all in you. So, what do you do?\n\nPersonally, I would dash through the Darius, into the minion wave, and use that to kite him and make him chase me. Now, if you haven't been leveling up e, you are gonna have a bad time as you will quickly run out of things to dash to.\n\n But assuming that we have been maxing e, you can kit till the bleed wears off, and then dash through the Darius again, this time towards your turret, and to safety.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"LICENSED HOOKER","date":"2016-06-14T15:20:13.552+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I usually do just enough damage to almost kill them but that little hp bar to get 1% tilted everytime, then the classic \n\n\"not even close yasuo\"","replies":[{"poster":"Spicy Rice","date":"2016-06-14T17:52:39.095+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't worry, just keep at it, and eventually you will be able to spam mastery icon after killing people","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Spicy Rice","date":"2016-06-14T17:51:49.405+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Personally I feel he is ok, but could use a (very) tiny amount of love after losing triforce.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ByakuyaTwerkami","date":"2016-06-14T17:24:03.871+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I used to be utter trash with Yasuo.
