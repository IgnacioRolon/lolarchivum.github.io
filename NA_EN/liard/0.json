I recommend completing a reset of these settings with the steps below.\n\nFirst, you'll want to **log into the game** then hop into **a custom game**. *Alt+Tab* out of the match, then navigate to your install folder, which should be in the following directory:\n\n>**C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends**\n\nDelete the folder named **CONFIG**\n\nOnce you've deleted the folder, leave the match, then hop into another custom match to confirm the changes have saved and that everything is now default. Let me know if this helped!","replies":[{"poster":"Liard","date":"2016-08-09T20:52:28.300+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That did it! Thank ya! :3","replies":[]}]}]}
