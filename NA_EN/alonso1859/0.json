As we all know, AFKs unbalance the game and are frustrating for everybody (personally I dislike as much a game I win with 50-10 kills as one I lose with 10-50 kills). Looks like the general advice is &quot;deal with it&quot;, or at best &quot;take the chance to improve different skills&quot;.\n\nI have a couple of ideas aimed at &quot;rebalancing&quot; the game and improving the experience:\n\n1. What if the team which still has 5 players decides to make an effort to balance the game? Essentially, one of the players volunteers to AFK himself so that the game becomes a 4v4. He does it in some way that prevents him from getting a penalty, of course. 4v4 is not perfect, but it&#039;s much better than 5v4. I&#039;m sure many people would be willing to volunteer (for different reasons, probably), and it would help to create a nice atmosphere.\n\n2. What about an automatic feature that allows a new player to replace the AFK player? You&#039;re queuing for a game and you get a message saying something like: \"You still have to wait ten minutes for your match, but if you&#039;re willing to replace an AFK in a match which has already started, you can start playing straight away&quot;. I think a lot of people would click &quot;Accept&quot;.\n\nSo what do you think about these ideas? Are they feasible? Sensible? Ludicrous? Let me know.","replies":[{"poster":"YerroFever","date":"2017-01-04T17:27:12.669+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"For the second suggestion, in addition to doing the player replacement, you should get the ability to Undo all items in your inventory rather than having to sell back at a penalty.\n\nHowever, you'd still be locked in with the same champ, summoners, masteries, and runes.","replies":[{"poster":"Paquay","date":"2017-01-04T23:05:30.621+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like this idea. I think the other challenge is determining how long someone needs to be afk/dc before they can be replaced. \n\nI think a reward system for people queuing for \"in-game fill\" spots would help to attract more people. Something like being given a guaranteed role and queue priority on your next 2 or 3 matches. Like bumped near the top of the list for queue times so you can get in within like a minute of queueing and with a guaranteed role.","replies":[{"poster":"YerroFever","date":"2017-01-05T00:13:54.268+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Paquay,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=15AKldpq,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2017-01-04T23:05:30.621+0000)\n>\n> I like this idea.

People still want to win the game, especially in ranked.\n\n2) Replace with whom? Once again, I'm sceptical that many players would opt to join a game already in progress. Especially since AFKs tend to come from teams that are already doing poorly. I know I wouldn't want to enter a game where my team was already losing. Having such a feature would also add to the toxic environment if someone on the team was doing poorly.\n\n\"You suck <champion name>, AFK so that we might get someone useful\".","replies":[{"poster":"Alonso1859","date":"2017-01-04T08:48:58.360+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"1) The honor system would help a lot here. An advantage of this idea is that it can be done with the game as it is, it doesn't necessarily require Riot to create a new feature. With the game as it is, the player who volunteers would probably get a lot of \"honorable opponent\" mentions, which seem to be the harder ones to get. Even his own teammates might honor him. Apart from that, Riot could implement a feature that gives additional rewards for doing this. With the right rewards, this could easily become standard behaviour.\n\n2) Again, I'm sure the honor system coupled with appropriate rewards would make this happen. Regarding the toxic environment, what you say would certainly happen, but only in games which already had a toxic environment anyway. Instead of saying \"<champion name>, you're such a noob, stop feeding\", they would say \"You suck <champion name>, AFK so that we might get someone useful\". It wouldn't make a big difference.\n\n3) The feature mentioned by Limmie sounds great and has the huge advantage that it's already been tested.\n\nRight now I can't tell which one is best. Would love to get more feedback about this.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2017-01-03T22:55:59.770+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the feature that other MOBAs have of redistributing the AFK's resources to the rest of the team is better than any of these suggestions.

As for why LoL doesn't implement something like this, I remember Lyte saying in a podcast something like \"by keeping the AFK player's resources intact and with the rubberband feature, we're keeping the door open for the AFK players to come back and redeem themselves\".

However, that doesn't make much sense to me. Of course it's fair to give the AFKer a bit of time in case he just had a temporary problem. But after a couple of minutes or so, that's it, he's gone and it's completely fair to put him out of the game and do something to rebalance it.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Alonso1859","date":"2017-02-09T03:41:06.346+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For the record, I've tried the first idea about five or six times, but no luck so far.
