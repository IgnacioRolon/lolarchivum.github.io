The game worked completely fine before the patch, no lag, no issues. After the patch, insane packet loss in every game, champions blinking around, can't see projectiles, \"Attempting to reconnect\" appearing after ms suddenly jumping to 500.\r\n\r\nInstead respond to these threads with a \"we are aware of the issue and working on solving it\", please.\r\nThe game is unplayable as of now for me and a bunch of other people and we need to know when we can launch and enjoy the game again.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-26T15:38:12.073+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"These cases need more information and investigation through troubleshooting, and I need this help to rule out possibilities.  For your specific case, the kind of input delays you are reporting are usually due to network or packet loss issues.  As a first step, I'd like you to run a [log reader](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743-Connection-Troubleshooting-Log-Reader) of the games with these spikes so we can analyze the situation.

That happened one or two seasons ago and at that point I took a break from playing and once I came back again it was fixed.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-26T17:39:07.925+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the information on this!  There certainly appears to be a network issue causing some major packet loss, and honestly a big part of that might be the long distance reaching the NA server in combination with how your ISP is getting there.  The results of the log reader should have provided some steps to fix this, but I also recommend checking out our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues).  Make sure to go through each step, and specifically configuring your dns.  Hopefully this will help improve your connection to what it was before, but keep in mind that it can't exceed the expectation of your connection travelling such a far distance.","replies":[{"poster":"MojaVath","date":"2016-08-26T17:46:33.676+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is nothing that I can do to fix this issue, not now and not when it happened before and this is not caused because I am EU, it happens to NA playing on NA servers aswell.
