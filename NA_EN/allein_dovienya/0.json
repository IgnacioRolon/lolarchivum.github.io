I like this. Does it need to be advertised, though? I don't see how that is crucial to its point.\n\nThe honour flair bugs me more because I personally feel that however I played LAST game, it has exactly zero relevance THIS game. And yeah, you've hit the nail on the head with no way to really avoid it.\n\nAs for the other violations of privacy, Ranked rewards can be removed already by submitting a ticket so nobody can see them. Summoner Level is unfortunate, and I'd like an option to hide it too, but it made less of a difference until recently when it capped at thirty. You choose your own summoner icon and name, so I don't consider them violations. The important thing is what you do and don't have the ability to CHOOSE.\n\nBut the honour flair and mastery badge are both something that is _actively advertised_, and that's the core of my problem.","replies":[{"poster":"Umbral Regent","date":"2018-01-12T05:18:37.714+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think Mastery would be quite as impactful or worthwhile if it wasn't shown. It's easy to play a Champion well and confirm to yourself - on a game-to-game basis - that you excel with that Champion, but Mastery is meant to announce that skill to others. I could tell people that I'm a badass with Leona every game, but nobody would really have any proof until I've already dominated.\n\nWith Mastery banners, on the other hand, I have my teammates aware from the gate that I've accrued some wealth of experience with Leona, that they can trust in my intuition and ability. I may have already known that I can rock the Solari goddess, but Mastery lets me boast it to others without having to say a word.\n\nAnd, while one may disagree, I think that that boasting of prowess with a Champion is core to the idea behind Mastery, especially with MR6+, where the prerequisites for those levels are scoring S-'s and S's. I couldn't really imagine the Champion Mastery system would be worth much outside of the Hextech Chests if the banners were to be hidden.\n\nBut, at the same time, I'm also aware that higher Mastery Ranks do produce some sort of expectation for some players. God knows I'm liable to catch some flak if I go about getting beaten as Azir - I'm MR7 with him, I'm supposed to be good with him. But, regardless of player expectation, I still feel the whole point of Mastery is to pronounce yourself as having some degree of skill and dedication to a Champion.\n\n---\n\nWhile I can agree with the bit about one's play in a prior match has no bearing in a new one, I kinda have to say that the point is a little moot. Honor really has no bearing on any match - any flairs just tell people \"well, this person is whatever level above 3, and someone liked them, so I guess they're patient and p/ okay players\".\n\nI'm still not wholly sure how I feel about Honor being visible to enemies (despite Ranked accolades and Mastery not being so), but I suppose it's there just to stand in until they can do proper work on the Honorable Opponent option again. Though I admit, it would be nice for players to hide their Honors from enemies, due to the (rare) possibilities of abuse based on Honor.\n\n---\n\nHuh. I'd forgotten you could have your Ranked accolades hidden. Nevertheless, there's a fair amount of information one could gather about a player through Summoner mouseovers and Profile searches. Your profile (and the mouseover) display the Champion you've played the most recently, and the mouseover shows your most frequent role.\n\nAlthough the mouseovers I think are only available in the post-game lobby (or they could be exclusive to Friends list, I dunno), and I doubt anyone would really care to do Profile searches, so I suppose my major point is moot.\n\nAll said, though, and I apologize for this, but I don't think I can really see from your perspective on the issue. It could just be my own proud personality, but I just can't really wrap my head around wanting to keep that kind of stuff under wraps.\n\nI do hope that this discussion gives others something to weigh between our two viewpoints, though. I apologize once more for my inability to gain perspective, and I thank you for your patience and respect.

Personally, Mastery functions much like the old profile badges for takedowns, matches won, and so on. They're neat stats to look at, but mostly meaningless otherwise.\n\nFor one thing, there's no way to lose Mastery levels. Following your example, there's no way to tell whether you're a badass with Leona now or if you were a badass Leona player before and haven't touched her in a year. It's especially concerning when champs have been reworked, yet players have retained their Mastery levels. Furthermore, even with MR6+, there's no guarantee of consistent good play. It only requires 5 S-ranks, regardless of how long it takes. Someone with 5 S-ranks in 5 games gets MR7, just like someone with 5 S-ranks in 5000 games.\n\nSecondly, Mastery level is independent of MMR. Who's a better Leona:  a Silver MR7 or a Diamond MR5? There's also multiple queues with separate MMRs, which adds to the confusion. Someone with a high Solo rank could fairly easily farm Mastery tokens in their low-rank Normal or Flex games. (Or high-rank Normal farming in low-rank Solo or some other combination). They'd be earning their Mastery tokens more with individual ability than with champion skill.\n\nFinally, Mastery levels 6 and 7 are only available on classic SR. Someone could be a jaw-dropping, godly Draven on Treeline, but their hard work and skill wouldn't matter solely because they're not playing on SR. Naturally, it could be argued that they're not learning the expected Draven skillset by not playing on SR. However, as I mentioned, Mastery doesn't imply mastery or skill. Someone could typically be terrible at a champion, yet grind enough games to luck out with tokens.\n\nUnless Riot addresses these issues, Champion Mastery is neither impactful nor worthwhile beyond the occasional \"oh, that's kinda neat\" reaction.\n\nSorry about the tangent.","replies":[{"poster":"Allein Dovienya","date":"2018-01-13T09:43:32.636+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is all precisely what I have been saying for as long as the system has been out, and yet I have never been able to articulate it as clearly as this.

Have a nice day/night.\n\nI'm not saying that those who want the auto-boast option of their Mastery should have it taken away - I'm merely saying that for those people for whom it is merely a record log of their progress on the champion, an option to _remove_ the boastful option should be implemented.\n\nI really don't care about the expectations it forms or whether or not everybody else wants to have the automatic boast about their skill on Leona, Azir, Rakan, etc. That's really their business. But it's _my_ business whether or not I want to advertise like that myself.\n\nI'm afraid that on the honour point, I don't understand one of your statements. You say that you think Honour should be hidden from the enemy because of the admitted chance for abuse based on it. Do you think that because you wind up on the same team as somebody, they _won't_ abuse you based on it, if they are the type of person who is inclined to do so?\n\nYour apology for not feeling as I do is noted, but my ultimate question to you is this:\n\nI personally feel that your perspective of wanting to show off your skill as Leona, to use the stated example, is completely bewildering. However, I respect your right to have that **option** available to you. While I do not agree, cannot comprehend it, and think that it is alien, confusing, and strange, I also think that if that is what you want to do with the information you have about your Leona skill as marked by Mastery, I think you _should_ be able to wave that flag on your loading screen slice.\n\nCan you respect that I _don't_ want to wave that flag, and wish it wasn't automatically planted on my slice?\n\nI return your gratefulness at the respect and manners you have shown.","replies":[{"poster":"Umbral Regent","date":"2018-01-12T06:15:11.089+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"For the Honor point, I do realize now that it is pretty confusing, though it also comes from my biased perspective. I'm not sure exactly why, but I feel that, with Honor being visible to enemies, it provides that one little bit towards the information game that some people actively participate in - but, somehow, I don't really expect that kind of intent from allies.\n\nIt's only after re-reading it that I find I have no honest expectations about my enemies, but I always seem to have the expectation that my teammates will have a certain composure to them, even despite some cases I've had where teammates flat-out didn't.\n\nIn other words - I feel like (even though it shouldn't and doesn't) Honor flairs contribute to the Information Game that some people do for an advantage - scouting opponents, trying to find their weaknesses through their profiles and stats - but I only hold that opinion towards enemy players.\n\nWhereas with teammates, I somehow expect that the information present in loading screens should give them confidence - Mastery 7 Support? Bottom lane's gonna be that much easier. Platinum Jungler? He is gonna wreck. Honor 5 flair ADC? I can expect to worry less about my missteps.\n\nIt's very, very weird now that you helped me realize it, but I have probably a bit too much faith in the composure of my allies.
