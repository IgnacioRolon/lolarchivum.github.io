Just about anyone could use them, to be honest, but it would come down to the strengths and weaknesses of your team comp, as well as their general synergy with your build.\n\nFor instance, AP Xin uses them better than AD Xin because he must keep attacking at all costs, or he doesn't heal fast enough, and he doesn't cast fast enough. AD Xin, on the other hand, depends more on a devastating single combo, and his standard kit gives him the strength to work that sufficiently as long as it stings. Bringing AD or Armor Pen Quints would be more beneficial to AD Xin, probably.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AMYS GRAVE","date":"2014-11-17T19:32:15.081+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"i use MS quints for jungling... faster clear times and i can more easily get in for ganking.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jungle Lux God","date":"2014-11-17T18:00:28.098+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I personally like MS quints on just about all of my tanks.
