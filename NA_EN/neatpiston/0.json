Please Help ~","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello. A few months ago I was playing league fine without any problems. Then one day out of no where, I couldn't log in due to connection issues. I went online and look at every single post to help myself and I did everything, but for 3 days nothing worked. Then an answer on a Yahoo question helped me. Someone said to try using a VPN to connect to league. So I got Hotspot Shield to connect to League and since then I could. Whenever the VPN is off, I can't connect to it at all. \r\n\r\nSo my question is, why can I only access league through a VPN and what can I do to fix it?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-03-12T04:40:13.044+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since you were able to get logged in after using a VPN, my best assumption is that  your connection was getting blocked somewhere between your network and our game servers.
