I have literally tried everything on the internet. Checking my firewall, disabling my IPv6, using the Hextech Repair Tool, reinstalling, repatching, running as admin, changing my internet setting on Internet Explorer, etc. I was one minute in-game as Fiddle support, and my game stopped and \"Attempting to Reconnect...\" came up. I closed out the game and tried to reconnect from the client but the game wouldn't come back up. I closed and reopened the client and I haven't been able to login since then. I've given up. I have no idea what to do to fix this anymore. Please help! \n{{item:3070}} {{champion:32}}\n\n{{item:3630}} UPDATE {{item:3630}} \nI made it work finally. Anyone who has had this problem and can't get it to work just read this. Download \"Hotspot Shield VPN\" and install it. Open it and connect the VPN. It's free and you don't have to buy premium or anything. After you do that, just open League and login and it will WORK !
