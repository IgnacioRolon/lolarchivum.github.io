It has to be destiny!!! They are from the same theme and I can't believe how lucky I am to have opened both of these goodies. \r\n\r\nHowever, I need 55 RP to buy a key and get some Orange Essence to make this ward my own. I know this isn't a guaranteed process and it is out of the goodness of Poros. \r\n\r\nIf it is possible, may I get 55 RP for this humble drawing of the Divine Ward Skin that **missed **the bush when it was warded... \r\n{{sticker:sg-soraka}}","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2018-01-09T16:33:07.623+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Destiny indeed, your drawing depicts the master's consecration of the war torn lands.
