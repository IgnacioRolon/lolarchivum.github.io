I changed my DNS to Google's DNS and the certificate went away. If anyone is wondering how to do this I will post the steps below. \n\n1st: Right click your LAN connection or WiFi connection down at the bottom right and select Network and Sharing Center. (You can also search for \"Network and Sharing Center\" if you can't find it on the bottom right of your screen.)\n\n2nd: Click \"Change adapter settings\"\n\n3rd: Right click on the current connection that you are using and select \"Properties\"\n\n4th: Highlight \"Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)\" and select \"Properties\".\n\n5th: Click the bubble that says \"Use the following DNS server addresses\"\n\n6th: Type in \"8.8.8.8\" for the preferred DNS and \"8.8.4.4\" for the Alternate DNS. \n\n7th: Click \"OK\" and you're done. \n\nLet me know if this worked for anyone.","replies":[{"poster":"TrampledByWeed","date":"2016-10-22T13:15:54.851+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"BUMP, simple and explained very well for all of us idiots out there. i tried it out singed out and back in, no message. thank you very much for the help. i was worried that i fucked something up lol","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Buttered Butter","date":"2016-10-22T00:08:28.655+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"This works because you're NOT using your ISP's DNS server.

To turn this OFF I went to the very bottom of the page where it says \"Powered By: SuddenLink etc\" and to the right of that IN FINE PRINT is a \"settings\" button. Inside was an opt out of the stupid Yahoo option.\n\nNot sure if this is ONLY for SuddenLink customers or maybe not only them but other ISPs are doing it too.. either way, that's how I fixed this issue. There may be other methods of accessing your ISP's provided user settings area, but this was how I accessed mine.\n\n_Bing_\nThe reason the cert says bing is because Yahoo's search is powered by bing. Yahoo is partnering with all sorts of people (like ISPs and MS) because they're dying.","replies":[{"poster":"Laienli","date":"2016-10-22T00:53:41.494+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is interesting.
