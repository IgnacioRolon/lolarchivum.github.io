You should try relogging as a first step to see if that solves it.  If it continues, try the legacy client and let me know what happens:\n\n-  On the login screen of the open beta updated client, look for the \"Launch Legacy Client\" text at the bottom.\n-  Or create a shortcut directly to the legacy client in your League Installation. Just look for \"lol.launcher\"\n\nLemme know!","replies":[{"poster":"DEFEAT 666","date":"2016-12-30T22:57:01.741+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I try to logout and login again,but every time it's the same,I login on acc,select blind pick,find match,and every single time is the same.That notification is there every time,and when i try to quit,I cant...This is happend to me only on this account.And I dont want to launch Legacy client because i must wait 2 hours to patch it !","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-30T23:01:30.709+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The legacy client uses the same files as the updated, so nothing should be patching.
