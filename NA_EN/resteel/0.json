League decides to DC me I first thought it was my internet so I went straight to google to load a webpage even checked to see if I was still connect on discord maybe my internet went out for just a second I check my steam seeing I was still in offline mode that doesnt make sense if my internet disconnected in any way shape or form I would been put in online mode it always does it... Then I connect back in just in time to see my nexus blow up. I was gonna push for gold even if I lost back to bronze but hell I cant even play the game at this point it just doesnt want me too so I guess I quit... Like if this isnt a sign what is? Call me a quitter a sad complainer whatever. But holy hell I just couldnt get a break towards the end of this season... Thats fine I cant say I wasnt tired out of this game already. I guess the worse part is I helped out a friend get from bronze 4 to silver 3 only for him to win nearly 20 games in a row as a support main and get gold passing me without even trying his best playing poorly for his own standards... Really makes you think how much luck can affect a game and cause issues. This friend of mine stuck in low bronze through nearly 300 games just so happens to win 20-30 games getting from silver to gold in an instant as I sit on a pretty 56% ish at the time winrate unable to win a single game despite trying my best and performing my best. I&#039;d call him out for boosting but I have no proof he played poorer and didnt have any duos. It was just pure luck.\r\n\r\nMain reason for this post is to ask this. \r\nHow many have made it through a season working hard towards a rank only to have it snatched away at the end.","replies":[]}
