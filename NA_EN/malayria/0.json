This use to only happen when alt-tabbing out of the game on high resolution but is now permanent. How can we as players fix this in game, I do not wish to download a third party mouse icon?","replies":[{"poster":"Malayria","date":"2016-10-14T16:39:19.512+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"how is it not supported, i select the screen resolution in game? not to mention high res screens are not that new, this needs dev attention. this started happening today, barring i did not alt+tab, now it is permanent. explain to me how the dev team goes backwards.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-14T16:29:44.346+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you're using 4K or overly large resolution then you may experience mouse and screen issues, and is not currently supported.  The issue kind of exasperates if you alt+tab.  Your best bet would be to reduce both you monitor and in-game resolutions, and try a windowed fullscreen setting to see if that helps.  Hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
