Report everyone who argues?","subforum":"General Discussion","up_votes":2,"down_votes":5,"body":"So  i was recently banned for arguing with a troll player who stated outright he was going to afk (and that he did so regularly without getting banned). The problem here is the extent of my arguing was that i merely said \"enjoy your ban\" when he stated multiple times that he was going to afk within the first couple minutes of the game. \r\nI was respectful and polite in the discussion during my posting and was still struck with inconsiderate comments at the \"irony\" of my situation on the post. \r\n\r\nBackround aside  (since this post isnt meant to be about me crying) the thing that strikes me is that the justification for my ban was that i was arguing back with a negative player, thus detracting from the experience of the game for others. Now given that Riot doesn't analyze content on a per game basis (in terms of penalizing players) i asked  outright if i was meant to report every player for arguing at all? (which was tactfully dodged) which begs the question now...\r\n\r\nGiven that it's ban-able are we supposed to really report every instance of argument we see in our games? And if not; are we guilty of creating a discrepancy between  the game's community standards and the actual penalty system implored in the game we enjoy?","replies":[]}
