Fervor&#039;s been changed so that the only melee that can abuse it is yasuo (just build some crit man - riot games) so the only choices are grasp and the new keystone.  Why would you ever use grasp, which barely does anything post laning, when the new keystone gives you a 7% - 35% shield on the same cooldown as old thunderlords (30 seconds) as long as you have a stun/knock up (you don&#039;t even need to hit 5 ppl, you just need to have enemies nearby)?  You wouldn&#039;t.  \n\nOn a side note weeb boy can also use this keystone which really just lends to the theory that the keystone system was designed with yasuo as the base champion and everybody else can either keep up or fuck off and die who cares lmao.  Hope you people enjoy popping shields.
