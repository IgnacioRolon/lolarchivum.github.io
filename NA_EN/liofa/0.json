If Redemption's too strong, we'll nerf it. Suspect it is, though not to the degree it stands out relative to other things that are further out of line (e.g. Courage of the Colossus or Twitch). \n\nSecondary answer: Come on, if you're going to try for a personal argument at least get your fact's right. Janna's my tenth most played champ this year, with a whopping 4 games. Conspiracy theories tend to work better with a more relevant starting point, been quite a while since I've been on a Janna kick.","replies":[{"poster":"DarkRitual","date":"2016-11-29T02:27:51.342+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, get it right.

The champs maybe more creative but one you're basically talking about a KOH game verus a moba. Why i say this is that game is more about constant map objectives where as in lol you need objectives but can win without them.Hots it's all about the objectives and you will not win without it. Honestly to me creative does not always mean good.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"patmax17","date":"2016-11-29T08:39:21.548+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot Zwill,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=4OmiErpZ,comment-id=0056,timestamp=2016-11-28T19:52:39.740+0000)\n>\n> [...]\n> \n> https://media.giphy.com/media/PcTzEWBzqiL5u/giphy.gif","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Yetii Rider","date":"2016-11-29T14:58:43.723+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Haha, nice Smite Meddler.\n\nOn topic I haven't used Redemption yet (been playing wardens over enchanters this preseason) but I love the idea of a skill shot delayed heal with an AOE and damage to compensate.
