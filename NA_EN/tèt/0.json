It's no biggie, but that hasn't been used in a long time!  It sounds like your network might be having an issue holding a strong connection.  I'd recommend going every step of the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to help tune up your connection and get things downloading.
