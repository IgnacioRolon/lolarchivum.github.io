But even though I go to the settings, disable it and press \"Done\", it is still enabled when I open settings again.\n\nAnd about those \"normal words\". For example: \"mie\" (finnish dialect word for \"I\"), \"muista\" (finnish word for \"remember\") and even something so mundane as \"59k\" gets sensored. \"60k\" etc. is fine by the system, though.\n\nUPDATE: it seems like the system is not blocking ／人◕ ‿‿ ◕人＼ anymore.\n\nUPDATE#2: Welp! Only \"Chat & Friends\"-settings cannot be changed at all.

But if I message someone or if I receive messages in client, it appears to be on.

Although it doesn't seem to disable it in the first Place. It still puts asterisks over all \"offensive words\" even if I don't re-open the settings window. ONLY the \"Chat & Friends\"  tab reverts itself. I  sent a bug report about this via in-client button.\n\nAlso a little off-topic: since the filter blocks really many things, I would like to know why is \"59k\" changed into \"\\***\" but for example \"60k\" stays as it is. Who's responsibility is it to put stuff into the filter's blacklist anyways?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-23T21:49:41.482+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, a bug report was probably the best way to address this. It is a Beta after all. :P\n\nI honestly don't know who specifically decides what words are added to the language blacklist, but I'm confident it's someone on the New Client Team. Because I'm not on that team, I can't provide you reasons why specific words are blocked while others aren't. :/\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2016-11-22T00:52:56.978+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"there are actually some ridiculous filter in the new client for words like \"cos\", \"demonstrate\", and a few other basic ones that slip my mind right now. \n\nNever really understood why those words are filtered.","replies":[{"poster":"PaladinNO","date":"2016-11-22T03:13:41.145+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">\"demonstrate\"\n\nSeriously?
