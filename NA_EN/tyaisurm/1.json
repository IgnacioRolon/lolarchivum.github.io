Once those two combine into light-dark-orb-thingy for a brief moment before exploding, that combined orb appears over morgana&#039;s head rather than in between her hands. The &quot;exploded&quot; orb that she then absorbs is in the right place, though.\r\n\r\nNot gamebreaking, but really weird looking. Some patch glitched it, I think?","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-03-22T21:39:53.862+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"D'oh! Nice catch!
