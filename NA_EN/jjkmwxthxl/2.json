Btw I didn't mean that the game would be trash.  I just meant that it's probably trash in comparison to what everyone expects it to be.\n\nSuch a shame.\n\nGood thing my friend preordered it and we have each other's Xbox Live accounts so we can play each other's games for free and I didn't have to buy this.  I'll prob get bored after a few hours.\n\nThis is honestly pathetic:  https://streamable.com/rveo","replies":[]}
