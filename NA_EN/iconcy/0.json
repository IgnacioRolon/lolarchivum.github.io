Riot decided to make a Dota-like game, but based on micro and plays instead of macro level strategy. Fine so far. *And then they went and added 124 champions.* The end result is like guns in CoD or Counter-Strike: there is no strategic reason to pick one over the other, so you just pick whatever is best and it is almost impossible to balance this.\n\nWhat the new direction of the game needs is not 124 champions with 4 skills each, but 30 champions with 10 skills each. There's a reason Blizzard is intentionally limiting the hero pool in HotS.\n\nThere is little Riot can do at this point. They have two options:\n\n* Make LoL2 with a greatly reduced champion pool but more abilities per champion.\n* Make LoL2 with more emphasis on actual strategy (counterpicking, multiple metas, being okay with people getting owned with no counterplay due to decisions they made earlier).\n\nThey *cannot* solve the balance problem in LoL1 and it will haunt them, making them look worse and worse, until someone else does either of the above and steals their lunch.","replies":[{"poster":"Knight SoIaire ","date":"2015-02-19T00:12:20.307+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"or leaving loads of champions but taking stuff away from them \nthis way each of them competes some specific set of tools that is harder to replicate \nwe have tonns of skills and the main problem is that most of out top champions does everything their role can do \n\nif we make champion's more unique by making them less owerloaded with diverse stuff we can return the strategic diversity of champion picks","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"GnomeDigest","date":"2015-02-18T16:21:39.780+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":1,"body":"Riots balance focus is what has me the most bewildered. There are a subset of highly picked champs that Riot for the most part doesnt touch. Then you get moves like the removal of DFG (which I dont feel strongly about one way or the other) followed by nerfs to to a champ like veiger who used to rely on it. Wut? Its so backwards.\n\nThe jungle progress has been similar. Oh look 3-4 junglers are dominating the jungle while most others struggle. So Riot makes the base jungle items themselves worse? Wut? While that might have a minor effect on those 3-4 power jungle picks it will hurt much more on junglers already struggling. Again, utterly backwards.\n\nMy biggest issue with Riot this season is the mess the jungle is in 3 months after the new jungle was released. That is far too long for the jungle to be in such a shitty state. Riot seems to finally have accepted that the drop in interest in jungling is not just that people are getting used to something new but rather that a majority of players dont want to be stuck jungling in the new jungle. Considering in solo que someone will get stuck with the jungle role, whether they like it or not, thats a huge problem. Add to that that the new jungle requires a much higher time/practice investment to get decent at, and its no wonder most people are like \"forget this I just wont jungle\".\n\nDear Riot, you cant make one role in your game 10 times more complicated than any other role. If matchmaking was always teambuilder style fine, you could get away with it. The reality however is the set up of your matchmaking/champ select means people who are not jungle mains need to be able to at least do ok in the new jungle without a 100 jungle games.","replies":[{"poster":"Retillin","date":"2015-02-18T16:39:24.722+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":1,"body":"All valid points.

Elder Lizard and Ancient Golem bounced back and forth as being the stronger every time they had their numbers tweaked. That's fine. The problem was that it was the same jungle champions that would just switch items. So Lee/Vi/Rengar/ect... would pick what ever one was stronger at the moment. \n\nThis CLEARLY showed that the issue was not the items or the jungle its self. It showed that jungle kits with assassin damage, sustain, and high mobility were the problem. \n\nFast forward to season 5 jungle. It's the same champions that are dominating (not counting NEW junglers or characters that are given a jungle boost like Nid). \n\nLet's be honest, we on the boards are not as well trained in game balance. But if WE can see the issues then either:\n\n1. Riot is dumber than those on the boards/reddit/ect...\n2. Riot doesn't care about balance, they want flashy for the viewers.\n3.
