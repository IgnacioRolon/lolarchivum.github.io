This hasn&#039;t happened a single time in any of the other games I&#039;ve played recently (CS:GO, SC2, H1Z1). During these disconnects, I can still fully use Google Chrome, and I don&#039;t disconnect from Skype, TeamSpeak, or Discord. People can still hear me without any signs of lag and they can see everything I post in chat instantly.\n I&#039;ve tried multiple things to fix this, none of which have worked. I have tried:\n**-** Repairing my client\n**-** Completely reinstalling League\n**-** Contacting my ISP\n**-** Running League as Admin\n**-** Running League through Razer Cortex\n**-** Running League without anything else running in the background\n**-** Disabling IP Helper in services.msc (I read that a few months ago when people were having similar issues that this helped)\n**-** Doing the same three things after &quot;Contacting my ISP&quot; after Disabling IP Helper\n\nI&#039;m nearly to the point of just quitting League until this is fixed, although I&#039;m really reluctant to do so because I want to get to Gold before the season ends. {{item:3070}} \nI just feel that it&#039;s wrong to make other players&#039; games ~~shitty~~ less fun _knowing_ that I&#039;ll disconnect many times during that game.\nIf _anyone_ has any ideas on how to fix this, please feel free to comment. This is getting extremely annoying, and I&#039;d hate to stop playing my favorite video game because of it.\n\n- _Orlynow_, The Rift Inquisitor","replies":[{"poster":"FeArThIsBaStArD","date":"2015-10-22T05:17:57.273+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"im having the same issue and i emailed riot support, i keep getting the damn \"attempting to reconnect\" and its getting worse and worse, riot got back to me and gave me a link to go to and i know its not my net. the link took me to the same trouble shooting steps i have taken already and they are just giving me the run around and there is no fix or shit for it. its not even being addressed, in the email they just basically said \"its ur net here is a trouble fix link\" when clearly its not","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dark Morgana","date":"2015-10-22T00:27:25.381+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"YOU CAN'T QUIT!
