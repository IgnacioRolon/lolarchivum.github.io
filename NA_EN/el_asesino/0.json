He used to have personality and a real story, albeit sorta cliche'd and cheesy story, but one none-the-less. Now he's just a random killing machine monster that kills anything within his radius in the Shurima Desert, that's it. \nLet's face it, they've already thrown all the old lore out the window and admitted they're going to basically change everything. How do you think Lee Sin's personality as a failed summoner is going to last when they REMOVED summoners and the League?\n\nSo if you actually expect them to keep true to the old champions personalities then maybe you should come out of the optimist bubble sooner than later, as it's just going to be worse later. xD\n\nI agree on the not aging part, it just wouldn't really work.
