I know during the game it is easy to see which dragons will spawn and which have been killed by each team. I love that, however there is nothing to show that in post game stats. I figure if vision score is there for supports, then dragon score should be there for junglers. Relative easy fix for an self analytical jungler.\r\n\r\nPlease and thank you!\r\nAmericanAfrican","replies":[{"poster":"Sinayion","date":"2018-02-06T02:34:51.986+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"EDITED, BECAUSE I FAILED TO FULLY UNDERSTAND!\n\nI see what you mean now, in the Stats page. I'll ping the relevant team as a suggestion, but I imagine that attributing the \"dragon kill\" to one champion alone, seems a bit unfair. Especially if the jungler whittles it down to almost nothing, and then your evil teammates take the final shot.\n\nOriginal comment:\nI hope I'm understanding this right (because I am also a jg main). I can see the dragons that each team killed in the match history (below).\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/8CFMZtu.png\n\nAlso, in the Overview tab in Match History, you can see which drakes spawn, when, and who killed them.","replies":[{"poster":"Crett","date":"2018-02-06T04:18:39.402+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would prefer to implement it as dragon \"takedowns\". kills and assists should count towards dragon kills.","replies":[{"poster":"CptPICHU","date":"2018-02-06T06:38:27.121+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree to that!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"AmericanAfrican","date":"2018-02-07T00:53:43.894+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for pointing out that the information is available after I open up again in match history.
