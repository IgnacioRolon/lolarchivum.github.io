DO NOT UP/DOWN vote without leaving a comment please.","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":4,"down_votes":9,"body":"So for the longest time I have loved League of Legends for its potential, and since developers have been saying they want this game to be more objective based let me throw a few ideas by you all. One of the biggest issues in League is getting stuck with people that afk, feed the enemy team, play differently then you, or are simply just there to troll. Now that being said, it does not have to be like that.\r\n\r\nIdeas:\r\n\r\n1) Instead of giving gold when killing enemy champions just give exp and a temporary buff to stats (ex. 2-3 minute increase in primary stat) with a cool down of say 2-3 minutes upon expiration so as to not cause a snowball effect allowing the enemy to take a dominating lead by buying upgraded items with their new found champion rewarded gold and instead making the focus of them game stay objectively based on fighting for control over an area and farming efficiently.\r\n\r\n2) No one likes a burden when playing a competitive game, so If a player goes afk for say 3 minutes, is trolling and sitting in base, or feeding; the team should be allowed the option to permanently boot them via vote and receive a defensive buff for towers and or team making it more difficult for the enemy team to rush into the base and overwhelm via 5v4, also maybe allow stacking of this buff if the problem happens with more than one player. However if more than 2 players are afk allow for a draw vote where both teams vote to get a low amount of IP, exp, and receive honor for accepting that the game is clearly an unfair battle.\r\n\r\nPlayers are everyday people, everyone has different views and opinions of how to play this game as rightfully they should, and each person should play the game how they wish, however, this should not hurt the team. So if support player is moving at the enemy aggressively but the adc is playing defensively and objectively trying to farm or poke the enemy how do we stop the clash of opinions on play style and focus them as a team?\r\n\r\nSimple, you remove the benefit of that person taking drastic risks due to drastic rewards like early game gold domination and at the same time lower the benefit of them getting killed by running out alone and getting caught if that is truly how they wish to play and this way the game goes on and each player is able to play how they want.\r\n\r\nI have many ideas and I would be happy to discuss any of them to see the full potential of League of Legends unveiled, I don't believe anything i say or do is perfect, I am human and as such I'm asking for your help, comments, ideas to make this a better game for all players; so feel free to message me anytime either on here or at [nick20000002kcin@sbcglobal.net] and if you don't mind please title with [League of Legends Moving on up] as I tend to get lots of e-mail and I can sort out and review your input more efficiently. I look forward to hearing from you all and I look forward to the future of this game, Lets make it happen!\r\n\r\n-DvD-","replies":[{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2015-01-27T03:17:42.349+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The only one that seems like a decent idea is the Draw vote. Getting a buff for killing a champion would make things far worse than getting gold. Champion kills are worth 300g, the equivalent of 15-20 minions. There's also the fact that in a duo lane, you kill their squishy as hell support and now the other two just got buffed and can now kill the ADC even easier for another buff to destroy the turret, the enemy jungler, or the roaming mid, or hell, even kill dragon. When you give people boosts that aren't gold, that makes snowballing that much WORSE. Sure, you don't get 300g, or less if you've killed them multiple times, but now when you kill some one, you get a buff to help you dominate that much harder, stay in lane that much longer (Which means more minions, making up for the gold loss of not getting gold off the champs), and kill anyone who dares try to stop your rampage.","replies":[{"poster":"xX Niko Xx","date":"2015-01-27T20:01:13.673+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just trying to inspire ideas to stop trolls and snowballing by feeding the enemy team early on forcing the game into one sided battles, what do you think might improve that type of situation?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Adrian Blackbear","date":"2015-01-27T20:07:35.155+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Votes to kick would be a bad idea because people would abuse the system.\nI think that League should adopt a draw or use the \"loss prevented\" system in serious cases where a player disconnects and doesn't come back. It's kind of frustrating (especially in my experiences with ranked games) where the 4v5 is too much for a team to handle, and therefore your status in ranked is hurt.\n\nThe report system, though not entirely all there, is what you use to report trolls, feeders, etc.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Droperata","date":"2015-01-27T01:18:51.096+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Great concepts, might need a little tweaking though.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AloneInTheCrowd","date":"2015-01-27T04:01:35.285+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Too blind couldn't read but I knew where the downvote button was so i accidently clicked it .","replies":[]}]}
