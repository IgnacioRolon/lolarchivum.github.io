You should see a notification in the client when you receive the mystery gift since you already own Riot Kayle. \n\nLet me know if you don't have it by the 23rd.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zombiemaster","date":"2016-09-18T02:23:12.886+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The gifts are being sent to each player separately, so it's normal to receive one before receiving the other. Just hang tight as the gifts are still being distributed, with the 23rd being the final day.
