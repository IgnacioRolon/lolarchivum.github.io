So far as I can tell from myself and others on discord servers I'm a part of many of us can't log on because of this \"error\" and it's not going away.  It would be more accurate to say we might get after the maintenance has finished.  Especially coming from some of us who have seldomly ever had technical issues with League before. ever.  And then suddenly this happens.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"lucifetio","date":"2017-06-07T19:21:46.131+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am having the same problem","replies":[]},{"poster":"ABSOLUTE FORCE","date":"2017-06-07T19:21:28.577+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello I've had the same problem when my very own neighbor has logged in so im stuck but after waiting 30 minutes now I am able tto log in just check in every other 30 minutes like me and ill see you out there\nGLHF!","replies":[]},{"poster":"FouIu","date":"2017-06-07T17:26:12.164+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"II'm getting the same problem also.
