All of these could be offensive.   \n\nHell saying \"Quit acting like Hillary\"   could be offensive.......\n\nBTW the hate crimes are very few and far between.   MSM is blowing it way out of proportion and more then half have been made up/Debunked.\n\n\nWhile there are absolutely hate crimes being committed.   Most are isolated cases.   Unlike the the assaults on Trump supports in EVERY MAJOR CITY.\n\nIf you drive through Portland Oregon with a Trump sticker on your car.   The protesters are Damaging the care and even pulling people from their automobiles and assaulting them.   Just because they voted for trump.     Last I knew Assaulting someone for a OPINION was a Hate crime as it infringes on a persons rights.   Not all hate crimes are Racial.","replies":[{"poster":"FluffyWaffleFox","date":"2016-11-20T19:20:44.752+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"While i agree with you on some of these things, this post was geared towards the negativity around it and and riot's stance on it.\n\nIf you go down to Harlem and yell **derogatory term for black person**, you will likely be assaulted because it offends people\n\nif you go to Portland and yell Trump, you will likely be assaulted because it offends people\n\nthe question was geared towards riot's stance on something that is offensive to **some** people and the discussion that tends to follow has a habit of leading to a negative experience for a lot of  players involved. This was not trying to take a political stance, it was something i noticed was causing a great deal of negativity/anger, hence why the title is in the form of a question.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Espy Psyche","date":"2016-11-20T16:59:43.176+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Until Trump kills six million Jews, his name won't be reportable.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Weathered","date":"2016-11-20T16:22:55.746+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"Would you be offended if someone just randomly said\n\n\"Mussolini\"\nor \"Christopher Columbus\"\nor \"Hillary\"?\n\nIt's not reportable, it's just a person's name.","replies":[{"poster":"FluffyWaffleFox","date":"2016-11-20T16:42:07.825+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"well, the issue is that names like \"Hitler\" are censored in chat because they are offensive. and it is just a persons name.\n\nas stated above, it wasn't trump himself, it was the people committing hate crimes in his name that tends to trigger a lot of people.\n\njust as the confederate flag wasn't always a symbol of racism, but it is now to a lot of people because, mainly neo-nazis,  have used it as a racist symbol, just like with trump.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Great Muta","date":"2016-11-20T19:43:05.127+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":5,"body":"I would be offended if anyone said the name of Hillary.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"I Q","date":"2016-11-20T16:27:25.598+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Dude this is like saying all history teachers are Nazis because they have said the word \"Hitler\" while teaching you.","replies":[{"poster":"Divine Winds","date":"2016-11-20T18:10:10.589+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"But saying hitler in an educational way is different from saying it offensively.
