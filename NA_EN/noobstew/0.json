Either make his recommended starting item an Ancient Coin again, or, _preferably_, change him so he's considered a full-fledged melee champion again.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Boltrix","date":"2015-11-15T22:54:34.003+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This, just this.\n\nWe need more inexplicable silliness in the game.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"NoobStew","date":"2015-11-16T06:51:34.227+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Playing solo not a lot of adc's always let you last hit as Thresh","replies":[]},{"poster":"Beoridas","date":"2015-11-16T03:23:14.936+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"wait. did you legit tried to by a runnan's on thresh? haha.\n\non a serious note tho: i know you can just check it at shop and see it unavailable","replies":[]},{"poster":"Azure Hamster","date":"2015-11-15T22:49:57.444+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is a good question.
