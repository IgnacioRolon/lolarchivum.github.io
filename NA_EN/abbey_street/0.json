Come and get him!\"* is a possible reference to Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring.\n* Teemo's taunt toward Gnar, *\"Little guy's gone native.\"* uses an idiom that refers to when one has become less civilized, cultured, or otherwise adoptive of local customs.\n* Teemo's taunt toward Heimerdinger, *\"Wars are won with men, not machines!\"* is a reference to a quote by General George S. Patton, *\"Wars may be fought with weapons, but they are won by men.\" *\n* Teemo's joke, where he pulls out a mushroom with a face painted on it, references the film *Cast Away*, specifically Wilson the volleyball.
