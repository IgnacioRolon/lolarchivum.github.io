Photoshop, Painter, Sketchbook, Maya, 3DStudioMax, zBrush, 3D-Coat, Sketchup and others I don't personally use and am not sure about. I think I've seen people using Modo. The thing is the tools are just a means to an end so it's largely what works best for you. Some artists still do pencil+paper and scan things in during early concepting.","replies":[{"poster":"Zalonio","date":"2016-01-01T02:37:11.044+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can you show us some failed/scraped models you guys made?

I've always thought that would be a cool idea.\n\nI know the skins team brainstorms all sorts of skins they might want to make for a champion, and I'm sure most wouldn't be feasible for a release skin (although if you're deciding the thematics earlier, hopefully this might allow larger scope release skins). Since the cost of recording a few extra lines in the initial recording should pretty low, compared to the massive costs of recording new lines after the champ goes into the wild, it shouldnt be too burdensome to record those extra lines, even if they did end up never getting used. It would be great if skins occasionally had a few extra lines. Pool Party Zac would have been made with a call of \"CANNONBALL\" on his E!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lowkey Thicc","date":"2015-12-30T01:00:06.438+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow that's actually a good question... i hope they answer! :)","replies":[]}]}
