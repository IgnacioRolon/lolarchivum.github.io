First , I  got chat restriction, and its ok, I know I flame sometimes, like everybody does, don&#039;t come to me and say you NEVER EVER FLAME, sometimes you get mad because you are trying to tell your team mates something and it doesn&#039;t work. \r\n\r\nSo here&#039;s the thing, recently, I was getting flamed for -winning-   I was told that I was a retard, that I was bronze 6, that I should stop playing this game and all this was said by my support, and I didn&#039;t want to tolerate that and I reacted back BUT I WAS STILL winning the game,  the flame kept coming *still managed to win* and then I asked for a report, and even players on the other team decided I was correct and we should report the guy who was flaming me. but surprise, after that game I got perma banned, and its ok, ill accept my perma ban, but I feel with such impotence of getting reported because my support decided to flame me for winning.\r\n\r\nI got suspended for 14 days, and managed to relax and said to myself, time to change, and when I come back to game and play my FIRST RANKED game, WIN, and then got perma banned for my support and jungle both decided to report me, even though,the other team agreed that my support was the flamer.\r\n\r\nI tried my best on behaving, I reported other players, typed riot my personal opinion, asked politely other people to stop trolling, tolerated trolls, tolerated, flamers, tolerated everything, still got myself banned for trying to contribute to this community.\r\n\r\n-How can you not get mad when you trying to make COMPETITIVE GAMEPLAY and get trolled??\r\n-If people don&#039;t get the idea of competitive, its that my fault?\r\n-Why should I tolerate someone flaming me and stay quiet?\r\n  that&#039;s not ok in ANY community, and not talking about league only, talking in general.\r\n\r\nMy point of view:\r\n-GETTING REPORTED FOR WINING-\r\n-GETTING PERMA BANNED FOR NOT LETTING MYSELF GET FLAMED-\r\n\r\nThanks for the game riot, you have a great game, not a great system for player behavior IMO, I had a great time learning the game and met great people on this community.\r\n\r\nGGWP {{item:3151}}","replies":[{"poster":"Zombie Gerbil","date":"2018-02-22T04:15:15.764+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"This is a video game. Not a chatroom. \nYou're not supposed to react to chat's negativity. If someone is flaming you, mute them and then play the video game. It's really not all that complex to do. If someone is trolling you, then report them after. The thing is, if you get upset in a competitive game, maybe this competitive game isn't for you. Because this game relies on teamwork. You have to play along with them to win. Because that's all we're trying to do here is win, experience, and enjoy the video game. \n\nBut you choosing to type instead of playing the game, and reacting to negativity and banned for responding to it negatively, well then, now you know, the only thing you're supposed to do here is.. well play the video game. \n\nMute. Play. Report. Move on.\nRemember, you're either part of the problem or part of the game.\nPlay the game to be part of the game.

Please Haha. If anything, you're just making the same comment everyone says when they're banned or don't like justice taking place. It's because you're threatened.

Nothing has changed.\nAs for Casual Ranked, it does exist, we play it every day. You cannot justify negative attitudes.

Get that checked out. Soon. Everything you're saying is just pure cringed conspiracy theories about how the game is dying with lack of understanding of mutual respect. You're not going to convince anyone, especially as a person who thinks it's okay to ruin someone's day who is trying to use this game as an entertainment. \n\nNo, I won't ever comprehend troubled people with no understanding of respect in a world of an entertainment that is meant to be fun. Games are not supposed to be anything. Games are a medium, like movies, books, and drawing. We don't do these things for the negativity of it. Nobody should ever, ever play a game for entertainment that is not fun, for whatever your definition of fun is. Nothing about fun is supposed to be negative. Your fun isn't more important than everyone else, so you being negative just because it's common to you doesn't mean it's okay.\n\n**Fun is paramount to games when played for entertainment. That leaves no room for negativity, and Riot is working to keep that fun without negativity. **So don't bother replying, because I have nothing else to say to someone who has a problem with respect and enjoy this game as an entertainment. You'll just come with some uncreative insult without understanding the fact that you'll always be in the wrong when you're negative. **Period.** I won't even be reading your next reply because everything you say is absolutely and utterly irrelevant to what this game truly is.
