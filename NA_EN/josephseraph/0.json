It simply doesn&#039;t. It says it can&#039;t connect to the match.\nIt&#039;s fucking not my fault. It pisses me off. It always happens. I&#039;ve done every single fucking thing to try to prevent it and it doesn&#039;t work.\nBut ok I&#039;m living with that. Sometimes I get into matches after 4 or 5 minutes of trying to reconnect to the retarded server which keeps rejecting me.\nExcept that NOW I CAN&#039;T BECAUSE THE MATCH IS OVER AND I HAVE TO PLAY 5 GAMES WITH A FUCKING 20 MINUTE QUEUE\nYou have zero idea how fucking infuriating that is.\nIf you can&#039;t make your game behave properly and connect to matches DON&#039;T PUNISH PLAYERS BECAUSE OF IT!!!!!!!!!!\nReally. \nUgh.\n\nEDIT: sorry for the childishly exxagerate use of F-bombs. I was just really pissed because this has been happening constantly since january 2015 and instead of Riot fixing it, they managed to make it exponentially worse.","replies":[{"poster":"Mike Hunts Toxic","date":"2016-06-28T23:06:57.667+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"sometimes there is a load screen bugsplat, or the random \"you have been disconnected\" bullshit while you're on skype talking, clearly connected to the internet","replies":[{"poster":"JosephSeraph","date":"2016-06-28T23:51:21.213+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Exactly.

The point of this is: If it's not my fault but they don't want to take responsibility for it, at least don't punish rework \"AFK\"s. I mean the point of Rework matches is that they will be erased from all records, and it was just 3 minutes. What's the point then?\nOr at least idk only punish Rework AFKs on Ranked games. (I only play normal because normal players are already toxic enough, I really don't want to ranked.)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"dadimplayingrn","date":"2016-06-28T23:26:28.303+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"no, it's their fault, and i've called my isp and talked to anything and everything and it's not my fualt either. i've decided when i go to one of these esports events i'm gonna make so much attention that rito would have wished that listened to players.","replies":[{"poster":"Suntv","date":"2016-06-29T05:15:54.111+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=dadimplayingrn,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=mQbTogGd,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2016-06-28T23:26:28.303+0000)\n>\n> no, it&#x27;s their fault, and i&#x27;ve called my isp and talked to anything and everything and it&#x27;s not my fualt either. i&#x27;ve decided when i go to one of these esports events i&#x27;m gonna make so much attention that rito would have wished that listened to players.\n\nOmg I'm in tears.
