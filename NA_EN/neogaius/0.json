Security alert when I access the store. It states that there is not a secure connection, and asks if I would like to proceed. I am using the Legacy Client. When I attempted the alpha/beta client the store would not pop up whatsoever. However, in the legacy client I would continuously press the store button and it would force the store menus to appear. Riot is aware of it seeing as how they removed their featured sale items from the home page. I am using Windows 10. \n\n{{item:3070}} {{champion:421}} {{item:3070}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"jasonrohrer2","date":"2017-03-31T02:38:16.212+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same thing for us... except ONLY on our WindowsXP computers (we have 3 of them).
