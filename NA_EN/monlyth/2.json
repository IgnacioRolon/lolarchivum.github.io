But I'd enjoy it more if I wasn't consistently 1-3 levels behind the solo laners (thanks Riot), and if I wasn't frequently used as a scapegoat when people lose their lane. So let me try to explain some things from a jungler's perspective:\r\n\r\n1. The jungler is there to help you do your job; the jungler is _not_ there to do your job for you. When you mess up, **it's not the jungler's fault.**\r\n\r\n2. If you want a gank, **do not push your lane.** The chances of a successful gank are near-zero when the enemy laner can sit and farm from under their tower. The further away they are from their tower, the more likely a gank is to succeed.\r\n\r\n3. When the jungler ganks, **they need your help** to secure the kill. If you space out and didn't notice the jungler coming in for a gank, don't blame the jungler when the enemy laner lives.\r\n\r\n4. The jungler needs to farm, just like everyone else. Do you think a jungler is going to do well when they spend the first 7 minutes stuck at level 4 with no items because their teammates ask them to babysit their lanes constantly? A little patience goes a long way towards a successful gank.\r\n\r\n5. If you're losing your lane, your jungler can only do so much to help. Ganking a losing lane is risky at best when the opposing laner has a level/gold advantage, and you're not going to make it any easier by continuing to feed. Stay alive, don't take risks, and don't expect your jungler to babysit your lane 24/7. The jungler has other things to do, like taking objectives and helping the other lanes snowball so your team can actually gain the upper hand.\r\n\r\nAnd in conclusion, let me say this one more time: The jungler is there to help you do your job, **not** do it for you. Instead of blaming the jungler when you overextend and give up first blood, why not acknowledge your own misplays and focus on winning instead of pointing fingers to try and cover your ass? Starting an argument with your jungler will only serve to put everyone on tilt, and it severely hurts your team's chances of winning. Teamwork wins games, not arguments or egos.","replies":[{"poster":"LTK KoRo","date":"2019-03-25T13:01:21.313+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"could you guys stop with these posts? i see them here on daily basis and they won't do anything outside of setting up a trainwreck in comments\n\njunglers are complaining about laners, laners are complaining about junglers, and after that none of these learned anything.","replies":[{"poster":"Sir Saltarin","date":"2019-03-25T13:53:19.424+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/es/c/memes/A1jKVmbE-literally-no-one","replies":[{"poster":"LTK KoRo","date":"2019-03-25T14:15:33.063+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"also\n\n> no one:\nboards mage mains: fucking assassins are pushing us out of mid, zhonya is a weak shit item, ludens is balanced and dirk/hexdrinker are too good\n\n-------\n> no one:\nboards adc mains: adcs are still weak deploy buffs pls, personally as a immobile adc main i believe that adcs should have 500 base hp more because they get bursted and that's unfair thanks\n\n----\n> no one:\nboards support mains: mage supports are too strong they're better in lane while dealing damage in late it shouldn't be allowed and enchanters should reign supreme, peel 2 win","replies":[{"poster":"Sir Saltarin","date":"2019-03-25T14:41:13.866+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Everyone circlejerks but this thread was made when there was a thread on the front page for some days crying, here it is https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/es/c/general-discussion/cx0HrkvH-jungle-support-summed-up-in-one-quote?show=flat&amp;comment=0003\n\nAnd also this one right now https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/es/c/general-discussion/cmI103ve-as-a-jungle-the-biggest-meme-for-me-is-force-feeding-someone-kills-and-having-them-then-say-i-was\n\nAnd it's that constant believing for what seems it to be the majority of the jng mains on the Boards that they are gods of the macro game while the rest of their teams are apes, and they are right on the last part but the thing is that low elo junglers have as terrible macro as low elo laners.","replies":[{"poster":"LTK KoRo","date":"2019-03-25T17:24:49.969+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Jungle mains are spoiled for sure and they certainly overvalue their decisionmaking (congrats, after 3 ganks you have killed enemy poppy and took one plate, meanwhile enemy bot is 6/0 and took 4 plates+infernal), but i feel them when it comes to being blamed, jungle cant help every lane (unless enemies are unaware shitters) so usually at least one role gets salty and starts shittalking","replies":[]},{"poster":"Monlyth","date":"2019-03-25T19:03:30.049+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> And it's that constant believing for what seems it to be the majority of the jng mains on the Boards that they are gods of the macro game while the rest of their teams are apes, and they are right on the last part but the thing is that low elo junglers have as terrible macro as low elo laners.\n\nDid I say I was a macro god? I just hate the frequency with which I get blamed for other people's failures. I've had several teammates that lose their lane fair and square and feed all game (without any ganks from the enemy jungler, mind you; they just got outplayed by the enemy laner), but instantly point fingers at me every time they die.\n\nIf you're losing your lane, don't play aggressive. If you mess up, it's your fault, not the jungler's.
