As of right now, you will run out camps to clear and you have to either gank or leech XP from the lanes to avoid falling behind on levels (more than you already are, that is). If there are no good opportunities for you to gank, you're kinda screwed. This is why the likes of Lee Sin and Jarvan are on top of the Jungle meta right now, and why Jungle is such an unpopular role in NA now. Aggressive jungle strats are the only viable strats now, and falling behind on ganks or getting counter-jungled often spells doom for you.\n\nIf Yi would become overpowered in a meta where passive, safer strats are a viable option to fall back on when your team is behind, then that's a Yi problem. Or rather, a Conqueror problem, since that seems to be what pushes Yi over the edge.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-04-02T01:15:23.384+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I swear, the jungle undergoes more frequent and dramatic changes than any other role, from Smite buffs to Scuttle duels to spawn timers.","replies":[{"poster":"Monlyth","date":"2019-04-02T01:20:18.773+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like the playstyle of Jungle, but I'd enjoy it more if I didn't feel forced to gank early on after clearing all my camps (even if there are no good opportunities to do so), the Scuttle Crab wasn't such a crucial fixture of your early game, I wasn't behind on XP for most of the game, and my teammates didn't point fingers at me when they feed their lane.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"mrmeddyman","date":"2019-04-04T22:58:28.597+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"CAreful balance has to be struck so that farming isn't the ideal thing for junglers to do at any time because it makes games static and boring when they do.\n\nGanking should always be the most valuable thing which is facilitated by farming camps","replies":[]}]}
