I've seen a few cases where some players unlocked chests too soon, especially immediately after a new release.  I'd personally recommend waiting at-least 2 days for those items to become available through chests and unlocking.  Keep in mind that hextech is still random, so you won't be guaranteed any specific shards or content.  Be sure to also check out our [hextech crafting](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207884233-Hextech-Crafting-Guide) guide for more details.
