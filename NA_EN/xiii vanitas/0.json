Most of the people high of the military hierachy are loyal more to Darius than him and the people on the bottom just follow whatever authority figure they have. People are largely ignorant of politic.\n\nAlso which post you are refering to about Noxus military? I'm confuse as what you are talking about there. I'm sure Noxus probably recruits people locally and give them little training before sending them of the battlefields which is the reason why Noxus military sometimes seem rather chaotic. \n\nAlso Noxus isn't about victory, but more about strength which is different.

Where it was pointed out how seemingly random the Noxus equipment is. The explanation for this given by Jaredan was because Noxus just let their soldiers use what equipment they want.\n\nBut that's stupid. That is the exact opposite of what an effective army should do. Tricks win battles. Throwing wave after wave of your own men at the enemy without thought of tactical implication or making the formations effective is literally Zap Brannigan's method of warfare. There is no way doing that would create an empire like Noxus has. They should lose basically every engagement against an army with even a little discipline and coordination. \n\nThey essentially have what Hollywood thinks barbarians fought like (they didn't though, after the Alamanians barbarians did use formations. Very effectively even) and declared that by doing that they've carved out the Roman Empire for themselves. But that's dumb. Formations and organization helps win battles. Figuring out tricks and ways to outmaneuver your opponent wins battles. Riot is basically saying that Noxus read Sun Tzu decided to do the opposite of all his advise, but they're also now super successful. Just go with it. \n\nBut that's idiotic and doesn't make sense. \n\nTo do a history example (because I love them) Riot is basically saying that all Noxian generals before Swain fought like Xerxes ordering his men to fight head on (worse than Xerxes actually, since Xerxes used formations. Effective ones if they were fighting in open terrain). Somehow this won an empire. But Xerxes didn't win an empire, Cyrus did.

You bring up how they're supposedly against tricks and schemes and tactics even though Swain's existence contradicts that. Never mind the fact that he's a cripple. He's the smartest, most competent guy around and he gets results, so he's the boss.\n\nAlso: \"Noxus isn't about victory\"? What?\nNoxus is all about victory.  In their culture, victory equates to strength. Their philosophy isn't \"you're stronger, so you should win\", it's more like \"you won, therefore you're stronger\". \nTo better illustrate this, picture this: A big, buff guy gets into a fight with some short, scrawny guy with a knife, and the scrawny kills the big guy with said knife. If it happens anywhere else, scrawny guy's considered a cheater. This doesn't matter to Noxus. He came out of it alive, so he's strong. Doesn't matter how much more physically capable or smart the other guy was. He's dead, so he's weak.\n\nMany of the big things done from Noxus' side was done with this philosophy in mind. \nResurrecting Sion? Darius thinks it's dishonourable, but puts up with it 'cause he'll help them win. \nFucking over Riven and her squad? They were on the losing side, so they weren't considered strong enough to be worth keeping around, and therefore didn't matter.

You can see this in their weapon desighn. It meant not only to cut but to crush their opponents as well. Their ideology is to beat any defense, scheme and opponent through pure brute force. Darius line of never retreat shows this. \n\nThere is a reason why its strength above all not victory above all. This way of brute forcing it's what most population idealize. Strength to a Noxian is to endurance, bloodshed, and pride. Of course this the ideal that drive the masses, but the higher up are a bit more pragamatic about the whole things. Cheap tricks and schemes are tolerable but not favoured or liked. \n\nAlso your example are quite terrible to prove your point. Sion was ressurected because boram thought he could revive the literal symbol of strength. Someone who brute force his way through the demacian army and choked the king to death. That endurance and bravery was what the Noxian idealized not the hulking rage monster that sion became. Also the whole Riven incident is much more complexed and has far more factor to dive into for now. All have to say is to remember that the Noxus send singed to deal with the problem, probably not expecting the consequences. The Zaunite mercenary shock alot of Noxian in their cruelty, this shows that the Noxian isn't just about victory.

Only when the League got formed did they bring him back in.\n\nEven if that's not canon anymore, Kled's comments ring hollow, because the rank he claims for himself depends on him submitting to a rank system in the first place i.e. the same way as Darius.\n\nDarius also supports Swain because even though Darius is physically strong, he knew he wasn't made to rule or administrate. Swain was the one with the actual experience and cunning to do it, so Darius decided to support him against Darkwill's son for the claim.\n\nNoxus was never about 'might makes right' in purely the physical sense. They have been shown to be pragmatic and appreciate intelligence when its needed. Heck, Swain arguably combines both brains and brawn, because his ability to transform helps him to stand on the frontlines. And considering how old he is and that he can't keep up the form, its' commendable he even still does that.\n\nHe even fought Jarvan IV in melee range and auto-attacked him in bird form for most of the time.
