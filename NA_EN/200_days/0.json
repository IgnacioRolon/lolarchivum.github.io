Here is a pic of 1 of them above. \r\nI thought this was only for Ultimate skins with icons yet I&#039;ve seen this so I&#039;m a bit confused and I also want to show off my favorite skin on my profile page. Any ideas on how to do that?","replies":[{"poster":"Bazerka","date":"2018-06-16T03:17:46.238+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"You can! To the right of the search bar on your profile page, there is a gear icon. Click on that and you can choose which background you want to display. I believe you have to own the skin before you can display it, but you can choose from your entire collection :)","replies":[{"poster":"200 days","date":"2018-06-16T03:20:14.887+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks :).
