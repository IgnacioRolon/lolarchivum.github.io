That and I personally think the old animation was just better in general it flows much better when he walks especially with alien invader and snowmerdinger. \n\nAlso the switching between the two when next to towers is also very confusing and doesn't​ look well either. \n\nI just feel he should have the choice.\n\nIf anyone else agrees reply and say how you feel.\n\n#SaveTheDong","replies":[{"poster":"Riot MapleNectar","date":"2017-05-18T18:09:25.655+0000","up_votes":58,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey guys!
