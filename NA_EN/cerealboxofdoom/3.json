I have to consider what mobility you have off cooldown before I burn my resources and put stuff on cooldown\r\n\r\n2. I might miss if I just yolo the shot out hence why I will probably have to lead the target some using strategic placement and smart decisions regarding lane pushing or how close im going to stay to my team in fights. Staying too close or being too far out can both cause huge problems\r\n\r\n3. flash is really useful against a lot of skillshots. Flash is a little bit popular since its release\r\n\r\n4. If the opponent is moving on a perpendicular path to my skillshot the window of oppourtunity to attack will likely be much shorter even if I can land it\r\n\r\nskillshots are not a liability because they are hard to land, they are a liability because non-trash players will find ways to counter the resulting playpattern","replies":[]}
