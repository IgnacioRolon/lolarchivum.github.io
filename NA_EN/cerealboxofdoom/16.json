But some of us seem to be interested in some sort of skill display and counterplaying these champ\r\n\r\nI'd like for you to discuss some of the ideas, patterns, and counterstrats available to the meta these bad guys of the meta (the ones who tyrannize the meta) as well as the heroes of the meta that can counterplay a lot of the nonsense these champs pull\r\n\r\nI'll start with some nominations, feel free to ask about them. These champs are partly chosen because not only do they perform well against most of these champs but they are also generally good and feel generally balanced in the mode in general. \r\n\r\n{{champion:103}} {{champion:60}} {{champion:131}} {{champion:51}} {{champion:39}} {{champion:10}} {{champion:126}} {{champion:21}} {{champion:99}} {{champion:89}} {{champion:133}} {{champion:102}} {{champion:98}} {{champion:44}} {{champion:15}} {{champion:67}} {{champion:267}} {{champion:22}} {{champion:34}}","replies":[]}
