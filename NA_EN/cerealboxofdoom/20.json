So why is he in bronze? He keeps failing his promos due to simple misfortune (not the champ) \r\n\r\nBut OHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH LUCK ISNT A FACTOR ITS ALL SKILL CUZ 4 PLAYERS ON YOUR TEAM AND 5 ON THEIRS ARE RANDOM\r\n\r\nThis is impossible to prove and probably false for 2 reasons\r\n\r\n1. Your teammates are not selected for your team completely at random. It changes based on how often you win and technically when you actually play but that isn't hardcoded into the game that's on you for the most part.. You WILL be set up to play far above your current level or LOSE. If you are merely somewhat above your current level then you are more susceptible to the luck factor.\r\n\r\n2. The less samples you have the more likely that the outcome will not match the expected result. If a gold level player plays 4 games in bronze there is a decent chance that he will lose 75% of those games even if after playing 16 he will have won 62.5% of his games. If that same player plays 1000 times in bronze tier and is actually as good as he supposedly is then that may end up being 84-86% no matter how many game samples you add to the collection or what REALISTICALLY SIZED strokes of luck he encounters.\r\n\r\nSo what does this all have to do with \"never surrender\"?\r\n\r\nJim and John both play their placement matches.\r\n\r\nand some extra matches after that.\r\n\r\nJim never surrenders and neither do his opponents\r\nJohn surrenders as soon as the gap in kills seems high as long as the team doesn't appear to have any lategame strat in mind. His opponents do the same\r\n\r\nJim plays his first 10, each takes 30-40 minutes, each takes a toll on him mentally and maybe physically. \r\nAfter his first 3 games a different set of people are now out of school and playing the game. \r\nAfter his first 6 everyone is out and playing the game and people are DDosing as they do in the afternoons. \r\nJim takes a break and something new is discovered, metas change, and patches and hotfixes come out \r\nAfter 2 days jim finally finishes his first 10 games. \r\n3 were flat out wins 3 were flat out loses 2 were very close and 2 were decided by some mistake the opponent made. So Jim went 8:2 and got placed pretty well. \r\nAfter getting into gold Jim had the misfortune of getting onto a toxic team and lost the game\r\nHe then met with 2 more strokes of bad luck and then ended up gold V or something and keeps trying to carry himself higher but he usually ends up with some bad luck ingame or whatever. He spent the next month playing only 3 games a day minus 10 days cuz games so long, aint nobody got time fo dat, so 20-3 is 60 then  * .66 = he gets stuck in gold V after 60 games which equals 39.6 hours of gameplay. \r\n\r\nJohn plays plays his first 10, each takes 20-30 minutes occasionally 40, each takes a toll on him mentally and maybe physically. \r\nAfter his first 5-6 games a different set of people are now out of school and playing the game. \r\nAfter his first 5 maybe everyone is out of school, he aughtta just call it quits for that day. Its gonna lag soon anyways\r\nJohn takes a break and something new is discovered, metas change, and patches and hotfixes come out but john will be sampling more of the changes from different players in a shorter amount of time and has no problem parting ways with the toxicity that ensues\r\nJohn finishes his first 10 after 2 days. \r\n\r\n3 were flat out wins or surrenders 3 were flat out loses 2 were very close and 2 were decided by a surrender from his team. So Jim went 6:4 and got placed. \r\n\r\nAfter getting into silver Jim had the misfortune of getting onto a toxic team and lost the game but did so in a much shorter amount of time because he knows better than to try so hard to win when you can't get along with your team he simply accepts his bad luck and moves on to the next one. Its not like its pay to play. If there is anything wrong with the way he plays then he is better able to discern if it is him or his team since he changes teammates more rapidly as well. \r\nHe then met with 2 more strokes of bad luck and then ended up silver V or something and this is completely irrelevant because a stroke of bad luck had lowered his winrate temporarily and he played 3 games for every 2 Jim played, sometimes more. By both winning and losing more games than jim, john found himself no longer so much affected by bad luck and over the next month he steamrolled his way to gold slowly but surely. But there was an important difference when he got there. He also had a greater variety of experiences and a bigger buffer on his MMR seeing as he had played so many more games. so he just surrendered and plowed through the trolls and even taxed himself less than Jim mentally and physically over a GAME. Both Jim and john eventually realized there was a certain something they needed to get to plat as well as not getting done in by bad luck. Jim would get to his promotionals eventually and when he finally failed he cried knowing how long it would take to try again... if he got lucky again... John on the otherhand gave no shits about luck and proceeded to learn whatever he needed to did the constant repetition thing instead of failing and waiting around to watch and see if the opponent will slip up cuz lucky him.\r\n\r\nJim never surrenders and by doing so he essentially never even bothers to play in many of the matches he could be playing\r\nJohn loses some games he shouldn't have but he will never have to say he was bothered by trolls or particularly prone to bad luck which doesn't matter much with a significantly larger sample size.","replies":[]}
