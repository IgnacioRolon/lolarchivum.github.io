I cant remember when exactly but somehow we got on the subject on who was actually carrying the match either because leblanc was bitching or the enemy was whining about how broken leblanc was. I believe both happened but I forget in which order. At some point I declared that I was the one carrying as the support and ventured to prove it with predictions and outplay. I've always kept such taunting very simple without too many extreme personal attacks. I assume I didn't do anything different this time.","replies":[{"poster":"IcyPepper","date":"2016-09-12T20:32:11.950+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe the first time as a joke, but doing it more than once is overkill.

Is this because they were able to communicate with you during game? or was it all in the end-of-game queue.\n\nthanks","replies":[{"poster":"CerealBoxOfDoom","date":"2016-09-11T06:49:37.734+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Based off the wording I used and my vague memory of it I'd say it was ingame.

There are reports of people using thirdparty programs allowing them to see the in-game enemy chat .","replies":[{"poster":"CerealBoxOfDoom","date":"2016-09-12T20:14:58.429+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"weird reason to revive a 2 month old thread lol","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2016-07-07T04:28:23.622+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, I felt a little queasy when I noticed that.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2016-07-07T04:18:18.455+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It was a support Lissandra, and she got more cs than the mid Leblanc...","replies":[]}]}
