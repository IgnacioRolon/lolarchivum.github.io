That's the language of business whether the businesses employees are aware of this or not. This is how it goes unless you just put out an unrealistic level of pressure against them. Why spread the hate when you can be easy and get what you want faster?\n\nLets do some translations\n\nhttp://2e130c55e0c2763c8a20-c7a4d0feffd26319b59c92c4aecae366.r18.cf1.rackcdn.com/88a057671808fec87bc5f885228b7f1c73f801ea.jpg\n\n**What is said**: OMG IM A FEMALE AND IM OFFENDED OMGOMGOMG SO DIRTY I DONT LIKE THIS THIS IS BAD WHY DONT YOU LISTEN TO ME WAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH\n\n**What gaming companies hear**: I'm part of a demographic you may or may not be interested in. Everyone knows its a huge new frontier but most aren't prepared to take a risk and be a pioneer here when they can just tap into the normal money cows. TearsTearsTears QQ haters gon-hate. Please stop feeding your families to make me happy.\n\nThis is what happens when you run around screaming what you don't like. You think a bunch of jews run into walmart screaming at everyone in the shop because they have a lot of pork products there? No, that's not how it works. Even when it does happen they just keep truck'n and feeding their families cuz haters gon'hate. \n\nBut lets take another approach to this.\n\nhttp://2e130c55e0c2763c8a20-c7a4d0feffd26319b59c92c4aecae366.r18.cf1.rackcdn.com/88a057671808fec87bc5f885228b7f1c73f801ea.jpg\n\n**What is said**: ^^ lol wtf is this, I PREFER THIS http://i.guim.co.uk/static/w-620/h--/q-95/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/19/1392811131429/d86e0777-b9b0-4a47-8abc-8ea802891ec4-620x372.jpeg\n\n**What gaming companies hear**: I have a demand, do you have supply? Here it is, heres exactly what I want. My wallet is ready. \n\nWell hot damn you just literally invited several upstarts as well as big names into your demographic instead of just running a well established one away from it. Good job! People actually do send tons of requests for new products at walmart because THATS EXACTLY HOW IT WORKS. \n\nNobody is in the business of tiptoeing around your sensitivities. Many are in the business of providing a product you can enjoy, possibly in exchange for something that feeds their family. \n\nNEW RULE\n\nFor every one thing you say you don't like about women in videogames please say at least one thing you DO like. Not only does this translate better to money-nese but can also help to get the rest of us on board. I personally don't really have a problem with hypersexualization in my games especially of women. I enjoy it! But I will also stand behind a cool female character that isn't sexualized or even butch as crap as long as someone bothers to bring the idea up.\n\n**Just to expand upon this.. who the hell DO women like in videogames? I've seen a million threads on what women don't like in videogames. What the hell do they like though?**","replies":[]}
