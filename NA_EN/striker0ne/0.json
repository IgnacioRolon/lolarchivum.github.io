My normal ping rate. (Doesn't get much better then that due to the fact my ISP in this area are \"Trash.\") About 5 minutes into the game my ping took a turn for the worse, 1150ms. I apologized to my teammates and played it out. We lost. Here was a link from a ping test during the time of the first game:\n\n http://imgur.com/Ua7Ub1t \n\nThankfully they understood and I had no reports against me. I reset my router, my computer, and after a ping test from http://www.pingtest.net/ (42ms ping after test.) I started another game.  \n\n3/24/2015 2nd game. This game started out much like the first one, 60 ping for about 20 minutes. I thought I fixed the issue with just some simple \"resets,\" but once that 20 minutes were up. 1.5k ping +. Worse then before.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a4L5CCY \n\nNow during this game I had built up mo-mention as a {{champion:83}} top, but to much to my surprise, 1.5k ping doesn't allow you click much at all in team fights. (insert sarcastic statement)  Lucky, again, my teammates understood and we took it into a defeat. There was much disappointment with that loss. It was too late to call my ISP so I took some definitive action of my own. \n\nAfter a 'tracert http://www.google.com' I had pings stretching into the 3k. I did the so-called \"resets\" again but still insanely high ping. So I changed my IP thinking, \"maybe this was a DDoS against my computer.\" It's weird to think so, but strangely it worked. My ping was back down into the normal levels. (ipconfig /release into ipconfig /renew into Computer reset) I also let my Anti-virus; KasperSky take a scan for the night. \n\n3/25/2015 3rd game. After thinking that all I did took effect and worked, I started a new game. I was wrong to do so. The loading screen gave me a 999 and while in game I had a whopping 1.5k ping. This was taken in game. \n\nhttp://imgur.com/UefJKx6 \n\nI reset my router and reconnected. But nothing. I did as much as I could to help my teammates but it was easily a 4v5. I felt so bad for even attempting to play a game. Thirds time a charm, but they also understood, I got a response somewhat like this, \"You got a case of the Crashes, It happens man, don't worry about it.\" This really restored faith I had for the league community. \n\nI decided to take a crack at the boards. Hopefully someone will have an answer for what to do, because.... I don't. Apologies in advance my friends, i'm horrible with grammar.","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2015-03-25T23:04:05.198+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Striker0ne !\n\nFrom reading through your entire post, it's pretty awesome how detailed you went through the steps you took, as well as the detailed explanations of your issue. When you get really high ping like this, it is hard to pinpoint exactly why it's happening.  It could be due to:\n\n1) Packet Loss\n2) Playing on a wireless connection, vs wired.\n3) Routing issues from the [Riot Direct changes](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204246204-NA-Server-Roadmap)\n4) Problems with specific settings on your local computer\n\nWithout any kind of hard data or logs, it is pretty hard to determine which of these could be the culprit.  Because of this, I want to make sure that you took a look and completed all of the steps in our [Connection Issues guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues).  The steps there actually commonly resolve these ping issues, unless it is something very odd.\n\nIf those steps are still not preventing your giant spike in ping, make sure to [submit a ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new)!  One of our tech guru's can take a look at the issue in-depth, and provide some further specific solutions.

Definitely not our computers this time. The lag spikes have been happening to multiple people in my game. Ive done the resets as well. Even contacted my ISP. They said its not on my end.
