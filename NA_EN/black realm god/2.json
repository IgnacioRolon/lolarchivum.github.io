Even at full zoom out I can barely fit some of the champs on my 1920x1080 screen. the lanes are also ridiculously clustered since minions cant be navigated through without phantom dancer or ghost. it&#039;s a good thing that more often than not we dont see all of leagues super heavyweight division champs in a game. if 10 of those were in a single lane or baron/dragon pit it&#039;d be impossible to move. i like the detailed models, but there needs to be a bit more space to move around and possibly a further away camera.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------\r\n\r\nI don&#039;t get how this is meant for story, art, and sound since I&#039;m not talking about the art at all, but instead the gameplay elements.\r\n\r\nDO talk or speculate about existing stories or art in the League of Legends universe\r\n\r\nDO ask questions about how something was made\r\n\r\nDO vote on discussions based on their relevancy to the community (use your heart)\r\n\r\nDO provide feedback and tell us what you want more of\r\n\r\nvs\r\n\r\nHere you&rsquo;ll find all sorts of discussions related to playing League of Legends.
