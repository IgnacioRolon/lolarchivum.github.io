I can poke him.\n\nThat would be great! \n\nWhile the rework is really close to being good (especially thematically), it did nothing to fix his usability issues that he's always had. Since he was made less reliable, he's going to be at a point where he has to be OP in order to be worth using.\n\nChanging how his MS buff on Q works, or even adding a slow to his ult cast, or anything similar would help him enable his own kit so his numbers aren't effectively required to be too high or too low for him to be healthy, like even the current rework iteration. :)\n\nI just don't want him to be rolled as is because he'll either be buffed to the point where he's usable (OP), or nerfed to the point where he's not over-bearing (way too unreliable to warrant picking). \n\nIts nerve wracking to watch him sit in his current state without any response from Stashu!","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
