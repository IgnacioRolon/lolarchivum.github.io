Diana is one of those champions that you have to becareful. One mistake on riots end and then BOOM she becomes the strongest mid laner/jungler in the game. That being said... Diana has been neglected. Riot loves buffing champions that are already good and let champions who start to be decent fall off. Diana for example, a few patches ago she was actually a pretty decent champion, but with the recent changes to how gold works with minions, she can't just give up some cs and then come back late game. I mentioned in another post that she is feast or famine and that she feels more famine most of the time.\n\nWith that being said, here was some of my ideas...\n\nCrescent Strike (Q)- changing the cooldown from 8/7.5./7/6.5/6 to 7 at all ranks.\n-This gives her a little bit more power in the early but not taking away from her late to much.\n-Diana's numbers are fine, considering the is a scaling champions and not a early game, high base damage champion.\n\nMoonfall (E)- remove- slow 35/40/45/50/55% \nNew- damage 10/15/20/25/30 (+10% AP)\nCooldown reduced from 26/24/22/20/18 to 22/20/18/16/14\n-We want to make sure we don't over buff this. As I said before, one mistake on her numbers and BOOM back to good old famine Diana.\n-Adding a little bit of damage to her E makes it so it cant be used as a waveclear early but still helps with diving that one poor soul.\n-Reducing the cooldown by 4 at all ranks will help use this ability more often and to compensate for that we took the slow off.  This change gives you the option\nto decide to max E second, Or last still.\n\nLunar Rush (R)- New effect: hitting an enemy champion with lunar rush will grant diana 15/25/35 armour and 10/15/20 magic resistance for 3 seconds.\n-This change helps her stay into fights longer and rewards you if you hit your q before ulting. hint: use her second ult after your 3 second buff is about to end. Trying to keep her from being a duelist is the reason why we are not giving her some kind of healing and thus champions like jax and fiora will still be able to out duel you if fights go on to long. We also don't want the incident where diana deviates from building AP scaling items by giving Hybrid or Ad scaling on any of her abilities. The point of playing diana is to have a damage dealing diver in the mid lane who can contribute more in teamfights instead of trying to contest with better splitpushers. \n\nThere is one thing to note out of all of these.\n-No high boost in damage so she wont become this one-shot, don't fight Diana, champion.\n-Tankiness from ult to reduce hard punishments from diving. This does not mean she can't be killed. This just means that she has more time to use zhonya's properly or escape to fight another day. You still need flash to escape.\n-No extra mobility spells. Last thing we need is another katarina jumping all over the map.\n-No damage or crowd control reduction to make it impossible to kill her.\n-Flat cooldown to help with early game.\n-Not making her broken for other people to play her. THIS IS A MAIN CHAMPION NOT A SIDE CHICK FOR OTHERS TO ABUSE.\n-Rewarding when hitting your Q before ulting\n-Making a definitive identity for Diana. She is a diver. Not an assassin. Not a battlemage. Not a Duelist.\n-Making her better at punishing squishies for positioning poorly.\n-Not making her a difficult champion, but can tell an experienced Diana (who knows when to use q/ult or ult/q, e-flash, and shield. And who knows how to use moonsilver blade (Passive) Properly) and a new Diana (who knows what she does but doesn't know her full potential).\n\nIF these were ever seen on her I think the best way to build Diana would be Arcsecond's ROA/Nashor's Tooth Build.{{item:3027}} {{item:3115}} \nfollowed by {{item:3020}} {{item:3111}} , then {{item:3165}} {{item:3157}} {{item:3135}}  with {{summoner:4}} {{summoner:12}} \nWith all this being said... I think this would make her a strong post-6 champion.","replies":[{"poster":"Olívía","date":"2018-04-29T01:53:11.917+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I kinda don't agree with removing the cc on her e, it's the only form of cc she has and it's actually even a pretty weak cc comparing to all the cc's in the game.","replies":[{"poster":"True Diana","date":"2018-05-08T17:48:18.094+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"So the cc is one is a good thing to have but the problem with her kit is that she has to many 'this ability is eh' and if I would like an eh ability I would rather it be with damage (to scale) than some lame weak cc that only hinders me to taking abilities to the face. I highly doubt that A) right will give diana a stronger cc and B) give diana damage and cc. If they were to keep her cc and gave her damage people, who dont play diana, would complain that she is to strong. Then we would be right back where we are now. I just played some games with diana and got demoted. At this point in time im ready to give up the fact of trying to climb and just stop playing until they fix her. Which would probably be never considering they are just going to say \"she would be way to strong and we have balancing problems with her\" and try to throw in our faces that they gave her a buff in 7.14 (which is wasnt).\n\nYou know its bad when rank 1 Arcsecond, the person who got there with diana, doesnt even play her anymore. and i agree that removing her cc would be a mistake but this is league of legends we talking about. We dont get things for free.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"TF Moonfall","date":"2018-12-21T22:27:50.669+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"agree with the q change,diana is sad atm and she is legit unplayable","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chalze","date":"2018-04-19T19:28:01.053+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Diana's literally as strong as you can be without stepping into Riot's nerf radar.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kelg","date":"2018-04-19T18:56:02.036+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"no thx","replies":[]}]}
