NO FIX. I&#039;ve been getting this error multiple times a day when going from champion select to loading screen and I submitted a ticket with no response. I have already lost tons of LP because of this, not to mention I&#039;ve been leave-bustered multiple times and added to the low-priority queue list MULTIPLE TIMES. I get reported after the end of every game because for some reason I CANNOT connect to the game. So now I&#039;m stuck waiting for my account to get permanently banned OR if that doesn&#039;t happen, I&#039;ll have to wait 30+Minutes to get into a 5 Minute queue to wait 30 Minutes for a game I can&#039;t even connect to to end. So I would like to extend my eternal gratitude to RIOT. Your game is fun WHEN YOU CAN PLAY, but when you&#039;re in my situation which I know many other players are in, it sucks more ass than the sodomites stating that the &#039;Connection Issues are fixed&#039;. So if a RIOTER could either give me an ACTUAL fix to this issue or I don&#039;t know, maybe remove the leave-buster BS on my account, that would be GREAT! But it wont happen, this thread will get buried because no one cares and I will have just wasted my time playing this game.","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2015-07-21T20:13:08.953+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":2,"body":"Hey ƒíght!\n\nGetting this error consistently is frustrating as hell, so I definitely understand your angst.

I was in the same boat as you and dArtagnan and the only thing that fixed it for me was when I switched ISP. I tried everything from changing modems, Ethernet cords, computers and even tried to reset my IP address nothing worked for me. For some reason when it happens it there is nothing that can be done some of the time. I chalk it up to gremlins doing it. I've spent numerous night staring at my screen with a bottle of Jack Daniels and a log of Grizzly Wintergreen Long Cut not doing anything but sipping, staring and repeating trying to figure out some of the connection problems that I've had. That being said... If you are getting this repeatedly and for some reason nothing fixes it don't try getting Riot Technicians to fix anything. They won't do it. I was in my first game of my promotion series, got another penta kill on Kat and got 3 bug splats in a row. Finally got back into game and won (thankfully), after that I restarted my computer made sure that I had no problems with connection on my end checked with my ISP for outages and even replaces my Ethernet Cable to make sure that I wouldn't get any interruptions just to get back into Champion Select and be disconnected from the server. Had to wait 5 minutes to rejoin queue and was back out of promos at 100 LP when I decided to try for it again after repeating the same steps. Got back into Champ Select and BOOM 90 LP and a 30 minute ban for not picking a champ. I sent in numerous tickets and did not get a single solution. All I was told was that they cannot do anything because \"the server did not seem to have any issues after running a check.\" So lost RP and got kicked out of my promos for nothing and was pretty much told sucks to be you.
