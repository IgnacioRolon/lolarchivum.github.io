Only solution I thought of is VPN's but they don't work. I'm not exactly sure what HTTP is (other that that it's called hyper text tranfer protocol), but perhaps HTTP can be converted into P2P data (is this possible???). So then I could find some software which does this conversion to get me \"undercover\" P2P data through HTTP network. Guys catch my drift?\r\n\r\nWhat I think hapens:\r\nGame server> P2P data> HTTP network >XXX(not compatible data type) my computer \r\n    .: doesn't work\r\n\r\nWhat I think wil fix it:\r\nGame server> P2P data> P2P into HTTP conversion server> HTTP network> my computer> software which turns HTTP back into P2P> game \r\n.: works\r\n\r\nAny IT's know if this is possible?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-03T15:58:37.292+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you on a home network with specific configurations for this, or are you on another network type (such as University) that is being managed by a network administrator?","replies":[{"poster":"Osama bin layden","date":"2016-10-03T16:16:10.970+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"High school network managed by admin in London but looked after by school IT. If you think you shouldn't share anything with me because I will be braking school rules, don't worry about that because I'm trying to do this in a 100% 'legal' way and I always double check that I'm not breaking any rules. I figured out two other ways to use P2P at school, but I need a USB to LAN adapter, and for the other method i'm to lazy to try it, but i'll get around to it sometime.\n","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-04T16:47:17.950+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since you're looking to configure changes on your school network, I recommend reaching out to school IT for assistance.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
