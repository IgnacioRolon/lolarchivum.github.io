Nothing is working and I can't find out why. It runs smoothly on every other game, just not on league of legends. I've lowered my graphics. I've turned off v sync and i turned off anti aliasing. Went to the control panel and changed some things.

If you know alienware has some kind of specific graphics syncing, use either our v-sync or theirs but not both. Other than that, double check Dell's driver website to make sure you've got everything updated to the most recent drivers as well. Be sure to check out the other steps in the [**FPS guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting) as well for help with those drivers.","replies":[]}]}
