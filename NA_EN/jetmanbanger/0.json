Dodging in champ select is usually an accident or because you don&#039;t want to play with that troll that wants to play Aatrox mid in ranked. Why have a penalty? its not like its wasting to much time. its not even costing people there ranking. It wouldn&#039;t be so bad if it didn&#039;t stack the time like your some bad guy for actually wanting to have a fun ranked game experience.","replies":[]}
