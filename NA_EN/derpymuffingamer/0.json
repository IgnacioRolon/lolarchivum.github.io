I'm going to copy/paste a few different steps our billing agents typically use to fix this, but if they don't help be sure to reach out to them in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new)!\n\n> 1) If your credit card was never fully verified, or needs to be re-verified. From time to time, PayPal resets the verification status of the credit/debit card that is connected to your PayPal-account for security reasons, and asks you to verify it again. This doesn't show up on the screen that will appear in our store when you try to purchase an item.\n> \n> The best way to find out if your payment method for PayPal is still verified is to go to http://www.paypal.com and log in. You should be able to find a \"To Do\" section on your Account Overview page.\n> \n> 2) There might be an error with your billing information listed on your credit card on PayPal, such as an incorrect billing address, wrong expiration date, incorrect card number, etc. This is especially likely if you have made any recent changes to your information, such as entering a new card. You may wish to contact your financial provider to resolve these issues.","replies":[]}]}
