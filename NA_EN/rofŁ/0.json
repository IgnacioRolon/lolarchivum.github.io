Was this changed so it does this or a bug? {{champion:119}}   main wondering. The link shows the skin when it was released and as you can see he had both axes spinning and both glowed and both still glowed after he used w.

I'd also suggest doing a client repair, as there may be a file that got jumbled in one of the more recent updates.","replies":[{"poster":"ROFŁ","date":"2017-06-15T16:33:52.790+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did you have a point in q and both axes spinning and then pressed w?

This is what he'd said in relation to your screenshots/video (he knows a bit more about Draven than I do): \n\nIn his first screenshot, he doesn't have the Blood Rush buff active, so there isn't supposed to be a red glow on his weapons anyway. The second screenshot, he has the Blood Rush buffs active and has the red glows on both weapons. I'm getting the red glows on the weapons from W while Q is active, for as long as W is active. Then it goes away when W isn't active. From his screenshots, it looks like that's what he's getting too. The W duration is a lot shorter than the Q duration.\n\nW applies two buffs: A movement speed for 1.5 seconds, an attack speed for 3 seconds. The red glows last for three seconds, with or without Q. Starting W before or after Q doesn't change the red glow duration I'm getting. Having Q active just seems to change the red glow particle so it's not perfectly round and soft-edged. It blends in with Q's VFX style. It behaves the same for me on Classic.\n\nDoes that sound about right to you?","replies":[{"poster":"ROFŁ","date":"2017-06-19T21:55:33.415+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think im explaining this correctly with comments. Can i add you and show you in game? The axes are suppose to be orange-ish when draven is spinning them which is shown in the first image and should be still orange-ish even if using w. In the second image i have one axe spinning  and used w and you can see that the orange-ish color from the axe is gone. This shouldnt happen.
