One of my favorite methods to getting easy stacks on Q is to use W, and once it lands, instantly follow up with Q. The enemy does not have time to trade (you are 950 units away) and you get an easy 2 AP. The third minion of the bunch can be killed with auto attacks or another Q, depending on lane conditions. Rinse and repeat.\n\nQ also has a missile speed of 2000 (same as  {{champion:81}} 's Mystic Shot). This makes dodging an unexpected Q challenging for most mid laners. Q changes now allow Veigar to be rewarded for positioning well and choosing to make intelligent decisions, and that for me is what makes LoL a fun and exciting game to play.","replies":[{"poster":"Sigma117","date":"2015-04-08T16:36:16.962+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are 6/7 minions to a wave. Before this you could get them all with his Q, currently you can get them all with the Q. \n\nThe limit on his AP stacking was never the Q (You'd miss a few minions before level 3/4), the limit was always the minions which hasn't changed at all. You get 6/7 before, you still get that now only you pay for it by pushing the lane (because you either hit 2 minions or position really badly to hit one) while having a less reliable safety net.\n\nAs for dodging skillshots, with missiles of that speed it's not so much reaction as it is pre-empting the skill/juking. When you're not stunned all Veigars damage comes from the Q and R. You can juke the Q and by the time it's off CD the E has gone down. You could use E+W to zone them so you land your Q...but then you're blowing 210 mana at least to land a Q which is absurd.","replies":[{"poster":"MaizeCraze","date":"2015-04-09T00:03:30.822+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Sorry, I should have clarified. one bunch of minions as I described above would be either 3 melee or 3 caster minions. \n\n>Before this you could get them all with his Q, currently you can get them all with the Q.\n\nDid you forget to put some form of \"not get\" in this sentence or are you saying that both pre and post change Q could get all minions? \n\nI believe that stacking Q was not as easy before the changes for two reasons. With a range of 650, Veigar using his old Q allowed for his lane opponents to effectively harass Veigar. This was exasturbated when Veigar was low on HP and the opponent froze the lane. Also, if the opponent decided to push to tower, Q's cooldown at max rank is still 5 seconds. This ensured that Veigar would miss at least two of his  potential Q farm to turret aggro or auto attacks to ensure last hitting.\n\nAs for lane pushing, this issue can *usually* be avoided by positioning and aiming strategically to hit one minion. With 950 range, this isn't particularly challenging to do. The only unavoidable situation for Q farm where this comes up is when the middle caster or melee minion is at low health. Also, most mid laners push the lane when using spells to farm. This helps to counteract the potential lane pushing that can arise from Veigar using Q.\n\nLike I said above, it is hard for the enemy laner to dodge an *unexpected* Q. The most frequent case that I have encountered is when the enemy laner goes for a last hit and is standing behind one of their minions. Another prominent case is when when I telegraph for my stun. The enemy will walk in a line in one direction to ensure not being caught. Instead of using my stun, I use Q. Since the enemy was not expecting my Q so soon, they usually cannot react fast enough to dodge it. \n\nMana issues on Veigar are trivial with {{item:3070}}  or {{item:3028}} , especially with his passive granting 1.5% mana regen per 1% missing mana. I get tear over chalice because it provides me with roughly 130-140 AP plus a very useful shield.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Kitsuki05","date":"2015-04-07T02:49:42.855+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":5,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Sigma117,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=JPZG5x0U,comment-id=,timestamp=2015-04-06T21:30:56.916+0000)\n\n> Right now you can&#039;t use the E to stun which makes landing your W next to impossible and since the Q is also a skillshot you can miss that too. \n\nAs someone who's played Veigar thoroughly before and after the remake, I assure you landing E takes just as much skill as it did before, you just path it further ahead than you would previously.

It is entirely more possible to believe that you just haven't mastered the skill rather than I have for some reason had significantly poorly matched opponents every time I've played. As to stunning them ahead, yes it is entirely possible to predict an opponents movements or to simply know where someone will end their movement on a dash or other timed movement. It's the exact same skill used when the stun was instant and you didn't just want to stun the location they were before they moved.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=DarkPacifista,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=JPZG5x0U,comment-id=00050003,timestamp=2015-04-09T12:58:44.504+0000)\n>\n> The enemy wont be stunned from that, because the will not keep running in the circle.

Are they melee and about to get that creep kill? Hope it was worth a dark matter bomb. This is even possible with ranged champions, though admittedly there would be much more room to avoid that.

Your Q is also a larger threat in teamfights as you can chunk the health of two of the enemies per cast instead of just one. You can harass someone outside of your fov without having to drop W and reveal their location first, and it's a lot less risky to do so, per the whole range increase.\n\nWhat I think posting this? Mad people like you should be told how they're wrong so that there isn't constant hostility towards people who understand changes and like that they occur.","replies":[{"poster":"Sigma117","date":"2015-04-11T02:50:03.260+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"The stun is only reliable against a bad player, that's the point. A .75 second delay on cast means you can't react to an opponent dashing, you can predict it sure but they won't stun themselves they just won't dash. This then means they have their mobility and you don't have your safety net. \n\nAs for using W to deny farm, it's really rare for a mid laner to be fully melee and even then it takes 1.5 seconds from cast to land. Again that is far more than enough time for an enemy to react, which lets them move and still get a minion. This will also likely shove the lane and cost you stacks on your Q for your efforts.\n\nThe Q change is nice but nowhere near enough to offset the E nerf. Hanging back and farming isn't fun for either party and using Q to 'chunk' in a teamfight only works when you have kills...which you won't get by hanging back and farming. Even if your jungler ganks a shift from hanging so far back farming to walking at your opponent to get _past_ E range will tip them off to a potential gank (because it's not enough to put it on them anymore, they have to be in the middle to still be inside the E).\n\nYes, I am mad at the changes to Veigar. Maybe I am wrong about him being weaker now than he was but it's my opinion that he's weaker and far less fun to play.
