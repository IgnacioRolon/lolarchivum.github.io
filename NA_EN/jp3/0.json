Hitting the button does nothing.\r\n\r\nCurrently the only work around I have is using the old client, will this issue be addressed before I'm forced to use the new client? Otherwise myself and many more won't be able to play.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-22T02:02:48.055+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if that reconnect button simply refuses to let you back into the game it sounds like something is blocking your network from reaching our servers very easily. The legacy client and the new client work a little differently when it comes to firewalls and such, so you might need to reconfigure some settings. Check out the steps in our [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to make sure everything is set up correctly. Hit me back if that doesn't seem to help.","replies":[]}]}
