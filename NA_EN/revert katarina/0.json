Most of the time these issues can be fixed by adjusting your DNS server settings to go to Google first (8.8.8.8 & 8.8.4.4) and updating your port forwarding to make sure our connections can get through easily. If you aren't sure how to update those two settings check out those steps in the [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues).","replies":[]}]}
