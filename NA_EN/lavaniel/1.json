We've actually ideated on a bunch of them already because they are a theme we all got excited over - imagining League champions at college >:D\n\nThere are several problems with these skins as they currently stand.\n\n1.  **It's way too soon for Ekko to get a new skin** - This honestly feels like a purely cynical move on the company's part to quickly cash in on a popular champion's release.  I'm all for getting more skins released faster, but not less than 10 weeks after the champion was released.\n2.  **The other champs in the set aren't starving for skin love** - This set will have Ahri's 7th skin (I count default as a skin), and her second one released this year (Challenger Ahri).  Darius and Vladimir also had skins released for them in late 2014.  \n3.  **There are many champs already on your backlog** - While the company recently discussed \"tech debt\" in a dev blog, the skins team have their own \"skin debt\" for [champs forever waiting for new skins](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/3bochNfU-top-14-league-champs-with-the-longest-wait-since-their-last-skin).  Surely, at least one of those champs could have been considered a worthy candidate for inclusion in this set?  (Headmaster Yi,_ for heaven's sake!_)\n   * Even if the company believes that the old skins of recently reworked champs like Kassadin and Sion count as \"new,\" there are long neglected champions like Zed, Lissandra, Lucian and Diana that could use some love from the skins team.\n\nMy words are probably going to fall on deaf ears and mean nothing in the grand scheme of things to you and the company, but these are the problems I see going forward with this plan.  I mean, will patch 5.17 have \"Angler Tamn Kench,\" a Fisherman/Anglerfish themed skin for the River King?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Imperial Red","date":"2015-08-06T07:19:34.878+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Academy Jinx.
