Her Q is also extremely binary: either it works too well against enemies with no gap-closers (i.e. Udyr, Skarner, Darius), or it frequently fails to do anything substantial. Either the enemy gap-closes her, or shoots her back from range.\n\nAdd on that it only takes 1 shot for her to slow you, and counterplay for the ability becomes very limited, so it's forcibly weak. Same problem as Frozen Mallet: it's capable of being a counterplay-killer, which tends to be toxic if it's at all strong.","replies":[{"poster":"Nucleophilic atk","date":"2015-03-31T23:49:25.947+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean, sure, she is situational.

She's a champ that requires a lot of skill in order for you to utilize her. Do you actually main Ashe? Do you play her on a daily basis? I honestly think she's fine the way she is. Just wait until someone plays her in LCS, then everyone will be playing her nonstop. Ashe is one of the few champs in game that still requires a lot of skill and understanding to play, and that's what Riot needs; unique, difficult champions that they have started off with, rather than always making everything easier for everyone by dumbing down a champion and giving them more powerful skills.","replies":[{"poster":"Ace Access ","date":"2015-04-01T14:00:57.472+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I want to main Ashe and thats what I'm working towards \nI want her to be more rewarding for being played skillfully \n\nher ult is difficult to hit consistently from long range but when you do get a hit in a team fight, your teammates can either escape from death or bring death to the enemy team \nher Q the low  amount of slows at the beginning stops her from chasing down and killing her targets early game \nW is fine as it is but the no dmg at max range hits bug is annoying \n\nher only problem is her passive, it just feels more like a handicap since she has to stop dealing dmg to gain stacks which  means you'll have wait forever early game due to cs'ing","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Venowolf","date":"2015-04-27T19:00:14.217+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I ask again, after 1 month of \"work\" when will see Ashe testing begin?
