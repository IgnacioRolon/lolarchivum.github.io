I bugsplatted right after champ select and had to repair my client before reconnecting and as soon as i did i had an issue with a new program i installed and was trying to close it down and upon my return to the game no more than 10 seconds after reconnecting my team had forfeited causing me to lose 19lp because the system thought i had left or disconnected...if anyone can tell me how to add the video file that would be much appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-02-03T17:37:56.963+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sucks to hear that your game crashed and resulted in losing those points.  Since a remake vote passed, the leaver would lose points, even if it wasn't intentional because leaving still causes others negative experiences.  It's really important to resolve the bugsplatting to prevent cases like this again in the future.  Let me know if that's something I can help with!","replies":[{"poster":"GreasyTurtle","date":"2017-02-04T01:16:43.664+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i was in game before the remake vote started, with 5 available votes, shouldnt that give me loss prevention?","replies":[]}]}]}
