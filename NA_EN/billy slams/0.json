This for me finally helps me understand why my ping was 115 since September and is now 135+ every game.\r\nHow many players out there also have poor ping due to them having Suddenlink?\r\nHow many players, such as myself and my friends, have the inability to switch networks because Suddenlink has a monopoly?\r\nIs there a way to get Suddenlink to become Peering Partners with Riot, or vice versa?\r\nSorry if this is in the wrong thread.\r\nThanks","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-09T20:00:18.383+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't have a lot of visibility on ISPs, but we have an open[ Peering Policy ](http://www.riotgames.com/peering-policy)willing to work things out with them.

There could be other local issues that may be straining your network.  I suggest using our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide just to be sure!

Do you have any info on how I can reach out to my ISP to get them to consider becoming Peering Partners?\nIt could be an increase in users on the network, but my upload and download speed still seem fine. Ping to elsewhere is excellent.  But Ping in league is 135+ and makes the game un-fun and in my mind unplayable.","replies":[]}]}]}
