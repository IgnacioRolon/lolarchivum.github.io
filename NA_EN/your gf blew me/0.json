So I start a game and Im given a 20 minute wait. I browse Facebook for a while and look to see how much time is left on the timer and there is 5 minutes left...then I check back a few minutes later and its back up to 18 minutes. It keeps getting low and then going back up...whats going on? Ive been waiting an hour overall to play one game.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-10T21:55:08.786+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did you happen to have a screenshot or are able to grab one if that happens again?
