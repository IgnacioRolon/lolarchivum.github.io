And every time I would click on it, it would click me out of the screen. So then I decided to restart my computer in hopes that it would fix the problem, and it did. Although, when I tried to login to reconnect to the game, it said \"We're unable to log you in because you may be offline\". Therefore coming to the conclusion of me losing a ranked game and my teammates to report me for something I could not help.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-15T21:20:42.193+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It seems like a decent number of players were running into this problem where a disconnect mid-game would make them unable to get logged back in. I'd like to see how we can help, but it'd be a lot better to do so individually in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new). Reach out to us there, and we can take a look at what happened!","replies":[]}]}
