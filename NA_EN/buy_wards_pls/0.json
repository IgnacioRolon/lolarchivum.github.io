It's not like they can just take the MS Paint \"fill bucket\" and recolor what they want to in the splash art.","replies":[{"poster":"disregardable","date":"2015-07-04T23:33:21.452+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's actually pretty similar to what it takes to make a chroma. People make their own models all the time, it doesn't take more than half an hour on complex champions (or 5 minutes on Zac).
