Kinda.  I can see the cursor on the blackscreen (only thing visible), but cannot move it.  Clicking produces a beep, and that is the only sound that is made.  The only other thing I can do is quitting out by shift-option-command-escape, but no other commands worth either (I can shut off computer).\n\nAny fixes?  Just started happening out of the blue and have now afk'd 2 games b/c of this.\n\nedit: Tried on a different account, get the same error except I can move the mouse (everything else is the same)\n\nedit2: Tried in 3 different accounts, 2 different internets (both with and without vpn), and followed every step in the connection issue to no avail (Including updating my computer, took an hour).  Still nothing.  I get a black screen except for my mouse, nothing moves.  If I click, I get a sound (normal sound, not sure how to describe it) and can only interact by shutting my comp off or forcequit shift-option-command-escape.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-03T22:03:21.287+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Black screens like this are usually caused by a connection problem.  Your network is unable to establish a connection to the server so ends up drawing a blank.  I recommend going through each set of instructions in our[ connections issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to fix this up.
