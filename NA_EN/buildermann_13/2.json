One of the first things I noticed was the fact that neither of the side buttons, reading as Mouse4 and Mouse5, worked for my summoner spells except when I was dead, or very soon after respawning. Before, I was using an old Microsoft mouse with one button on the side, reading as Mouse5. It worked just fine, and I never had any problems with summoner spells not working. I have used my new mouse in a variety of other games, such as Minecraft, Bioshock Infinite, Garry's Mod, Portal 2, and others, and I have not noticed any problems with the side mouse buttons. Does anyone know what is causing this, and possibly how to fix it? Any feedback would be appreciated. Thanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Smoky SwaG","date":"2017-05-26T00:12:22.169+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Try going into device manager and check mouse driver.

I also had issues after updating Windows 10.  If you are having issues, try this fix.  Device Manager showed that I had 2 mice installed on my desktop (when I only have one).  I disabled one and it disabled my mouse, which I re-enabled using the keyboard.  Disabling the other mouse still allowed my mouse to work and my side buttons to work properly in League of Legends.
