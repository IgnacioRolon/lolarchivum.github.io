I wasn't too good, I got a C-. However, we won, the Nasus on our team got an S, and I didn't get a hextech chest from that. I haven't gotten a chest with Ashe yet this season, and I actually don't think I have played Ashe at all this season (I do own her). Am I being dumb, or is this a glitch? Please let me know. (Also, if this matters, I was using the new client, and I got a key fragment that round.)","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-03T17:02:16.231+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If another player receives an S, they have to be in your premade group to be eligible for a chest.  It look like you were both solo in this game.  More info can also be found in our [hextech crafting](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207884233-Hextech-Crafting-Guide) guide.
