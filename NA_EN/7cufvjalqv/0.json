I haven't been banned ever, Chatblocked or anything else. I have apprx 2 skins for every champ ( in which I own every champ and sometimes all of the skins for a champ since I spend what it would cost to have a WOW account per month, for five years, on Riot instead because I play quite a bit) and I cant even get a response from Riot. This is very frustrating.\r\n\r\nI have RP receipts entitled to 'PrinceNothing' and transaction numbers as well. NOT to 'cnaiur'","replies":[{"poster":"Dark Morgana","date":"2017-06-06T19:24:33.593+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We're unable to recover the account from here and it sounds like you've already submitted a ticket for recovery.
