{"poster":"The Yetii Rider","date":"2015-05-08T20:56:07.425+0000","title":"The Trinity of Botlane and What it Means for Supports","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":129,"down_votes":14,"body":"Ever since the ADC support lane came into existence, there was an understanding about how supporting worked, both from a design and from a player standpoint. \n\nThe idea was that there were three main roles supports played in-lane. Sustain, All-In, and Poke.\n\nSustain supports were the classic supports who had the ability to heal others based on the iconic white mage style supporting from various RPGs. Examples include Janna, Sona, and Nami. However, it is of note that this playstyle, once established, became extremely unpopular with Riot, who refused to release another champion that could heal others beyond 2011 until Nami, and even then they tied her damage to her heal and gave it an insane mana cost. Bard is the only other champion from 2012 on to have a heal in his kit.\n\nPoke supports were the other type of \"classic\" supports who had the ability to deal spikes of magic damage from a distance in order to push the lane and punish out of position carries, disrupt farm, and prevent ganks with the cc often tied to their poke. Examples include Lulu, Nunu, and Kayle.\n\nAll-in supports originally weren&#039;t that well supported, but have since become popular with the creation of Thresh, Leona, and Braum. They are usually melee supports that play aggressively and chain cc in order to take out squishy targets and help their junglers successfully gank. Unlike sustain supports, who are generally masters of disengage, and poke supports, who are masters of poking and sieging, all-in supports were designed to be powerful engagers, a role that once was the duty of the jungler or the top laner.\n\nSo, this was the standard. Sustain countered Poke, Poke countered All-In, and All-In countered Sustain. It was a system that worked pretty well, and then Riot started messing with it.\n\nAs part of their ongoing project (The Team Builder system) Riot made some changes to support itemization in Season 3. They introduced items that gave supports much more gold than before, as well as scalings to help fit this gold. This did two things for the supports in the game:\n\n1) It gave AP scalings to poke and sustain supports, as well as reducing their bases. This resulted in poke and sustain supports heading mid lane in order to farm as much as possible and use their new scalings to oppress the enemy, as their peel designed for carries worked just as well for themselves, and their lower base utility and damage meant they had a weaker early game in a duo lane to help.\n\n2) It gave All-In supports both more gold to buy tank items (already cheaper than offensive items for balance reasons) as well as new-found utility for building this survivability.\n\nBecause these sustain and poke supports went mid lane, Riot had to go in and nerf the champions themselves. Lulu and Zyra both received hard nerfs to their utility (including a questionable nerf to Lulu&#039;s shield and Pix duration which hurt support Lulu more than mid Lulu, who leveled Glitterlance first). Soraka and Sona were both reworked, having their base power lowered immensely and losing a lot of their old identity while also reducing their survivability (and thus their ability to function in a solo lane) substantially.\n\nThe imbalance between the buff to All-In supports and the nerf to Poke supports led to a hole in bot lane that ended up being filled by mages. Annie and Morgana became the new poke supports, hard counters to All-In supports whom Riot could not easily nerf without affecting their power in the mid lane. Eventually, Riot did nerf Annie (mostly) out of bot lane while buffing her mid lane power, and gave Morgana some love taps that did not really affect her play rate in any sizable way, because she was still so necessary to deal with Thresh, Blitzcrank, and Leona.\n\nTo Riot&#039;s credit, Thresh, Blitzcrank, Leona and Braum have all received nerfs in order to make them easier to deal with, with Riot specifically hitting Leona&#039;s base health regen and stating plainly that the proper counter to her was poking her out of lane. However, with poke supports practically removed from bot lane this has become a non-issue. Leona is easier to kill in team fights now, sure, but in lane she remains a problem. A problem that the jungler now has to deal with because supports lack the power to do so themselves.\n\nThen came the ADC itemization overhaul. The nerfing of Bloodthirster and the power boost of Infinity Edge, as well as the changes to how mana regeneration works (which nerfed Tear of the Goddess, pretty much the only item ADCs could use to keep their mana pools somewhat afloat) kicked ratio ADCs out of lane and made auto-attack ADCs the new gods. \n\nRatio ADCs like Lucian, Varus, Ezreal and Caitlyn dealt with all-in supports quite well, due to their longer range, poke and self-peel. However, the nerfs to itemizations saw all their win rates drop and caused them to leave bot lane in favor of stronger auto attack champions like Jinx, Tristana and Vayne (and then Tristana got reworked).  Admittedly, since then Graves has seen a resurgence as the premier ratio ADC, but this did not happen quickly enough to prevent the change that this itemization shift brought about in supports.\n\nPoke supports depend on ratio carries to help them with their game, which is \"stop the enemy carry from CSing and win a war of attrition\". Meanwhile, All-In supports **love** Auto Attack carries, because their extended CC chains allow for long, one-sided trades, which Auto Attack carries deal much more sustained damage with. Thus, the itemization changes for ADCs in 4.10 were the nail in the coffin for poke supports, and we&#039;ve seen nothing but All-In supports (and Nami and Morgana) ever since.\n\n\n**TLDR** Sustain counters Poke, Poke counters All-In, All-In counters Sustain, but a lot of changes Riot has made has left Poke and Sustain supports unplayable, leading to the current state of bot lane where All-In supports reign supreme.","replies":[{"poster":"Thorns Rising","date":"2015-05-08T22:07:27.766+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":14,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"swordpas","date":"2015-05-08T22:31:50.493+0000","up_votes":28,"down_votes":1,"body":"You seen the mana cost + CD VS it's healing effectiveness ?","replies":[{"poster":"Wumachine","date":"2015-05-09T11:19:16.483+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"when you spawn in quickly rush down bot, drop 3 shrines and back to base to get back mana, 3 max shrines can heal an adc from 10% to 100%","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"The Yetii Rider","date":"2015-05-08T22:14:00.465+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":2,"body":"Ah you're correct.

I couldn't agree more with the points. Trying to play these squishy poke/sustain champs is a nightmare if the opponent knows what they're doing. I pretty much can't pick either of my go to supports these days because if I play Sona into Thresh or Leo it's an auto lose. \n\nIt shouldn't exactly happen, given poke should counter all in, but Sona's so unbelievably squishy that if I get hit by a hook or Leo E I can get gibbed  before I even recover from the stun. Nerfing Sona's effective range to be inside of their danger zones is pretty much one of the reasons why Sona isn't seen that often. And before anyone says Sona's Q is still the same range, if you try playing Sona and never getting an empowered auto off after Q you'd know how little poke damage she actually does by just Qing. That plus the nerfed power chord damage means it's honestly not even worth the risk which makes me wonder what's the point of playing her.\n\nUltimately it comes down to Riot wanting to build a flashy game. Soraka isn't flashy, neither is Janna, or Sona. The only mage supports that are flashy are people like Zyra, Annie, and the like which can bring big plays to the table. The thing is, these champs are being ripped from mid laners and stuffed into bot lane because the champs that were designed for that role are being pushed aside.\n\nI'm aware this is Riot's game and they should be able to make whatever game they want, but their philosophy in what champs get to be good and what shouldn't be good is very skewed. When people say, \"Aw man I can't kill this Soraka/Vayne this is boring.\" it's mostly because they got countered and wanted to play Ez/Sona to run a poke comp. At the end of the day it doesn't matter if they don't like Soraka or think Sona is oppressively strong at poking or Janna is way too good at protecting people, these champs exist for a reason. Sona and Soraka are epitomes of their role and their class archetype in terms of botlane. Leona is the queen of all-in as well, which means we can use them as a rock/paper/scissor analogy. \n\nSona beats Leo, Leo beats Soraka, Soraka beats Sona. This is balance. This is good game design. This is fun because it makes people have to think about their picks/bans and not just saying \"Well I'll play Thresh cause he doesn't lose to anyone.\" because that isn't fun. Players should be rewarded for making good picks and playing well instead of having Riot tell them they're wrong for enjoying a style of champion.\n\nRecently I've felt like Riot has been telling me my favorite champs are wrong to enjoy and that's just very sad. I've played League less and less and it's no surprise that Sona has gotten worse and worse as time has gone on. My pool of champs is ones like Lux, Morg, Sona, and Soraka. With nerfs to sustain, reworks, mana regen, and mages in general it makes me feel like the kind of game I am playing and the game I think I'm playing are different.","replies":[{"poster":"Hatless Casual","date":"2015-05-09T09:06:13.130+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Couldn't agree more, I've actually been wondering why the current meta is only tanks or mid lane casters as supports.

One important factor though that I think you should have mentioned is MANA.\n\nYou only need one full rotation of abilities worth of mana on an all-in support to do your thing (when you do it right and it works). Poke and sustain require a lot more spells being cast to be effective. Ever since 5.0 mana has been in far shorter supply (in the early game) for many champions, especially many poke oriented champions. There are no flat mana regen items (like d-ring) that are worthwhile for supports early on, furthering the issue.

Because this leaves less time for sustain champions to undo your hard work, and for their jungler to come in and mess up your plans.\n\nIn other words, an all in.\n\nChampions with strong poke tend to push their lane, making them susceptible to ganks, and champions tailored around sustain often have long cooldowns and other factors (like max% health costs or long charge timers) which makes them reliant on getting to do their sustain over time (this is one of the strengths of the new Soraka btw, burst healing makes her somewhat of an exception to this general rule).\n\nIn the end, an effective all-in support alongside a carry which also deals well with an all-in has a stronger chance of getting a kill or two without outside assistance.\n\nAnd especially post-6 some of the strong all-in champions has some really decent disengage as well with various parts of their kit.\n\nIt's a multifaceted problem which can only really be solved by making the other kins of supports better at their niches (sustain, disengage, poke).\n\n---\n\nIn part, the gold items can contribute a lot to the situation here I think.\n\nOne of the things which helps make all-in supports like Leona and Thresh so strong, is the fact that the relic shield line gives you on-demand sustain (out of the box you have two on-demand two champion 40hp heals in relic shield, if you have both stacks up, 80 extra hp on both you and your carry can be a powerful thing if used right), that you can trigger in a fight if you really need to, and which provides some decent sustain over time (Targon's Brace is roughly equivalent to 8hp/5 for both you and your carry if you proc a charge every time you can. 8hp/5 is quite a lot).\n\nSo the gold item tanky-all-in champions use is already giving them more tank, more self-sustain, and covers up their weakness to poke lanes very nicely.\n\n\nFor poke supports: Spellthief's edge\n\nSpellthief's edge emphasises a poke support's strengths, periodic damage onto an enemy, and covers up one of their weaknesses, mana regen.\n\nSpellthief's itself gives 25% base mana regen while Frostfang gives 50%.\n\nMost champions who take spellthief's and plan on sticking with it hit ~10 base mana regen at lvl 7-8. Meaning that at around that point Frostfang is worth about 5 mana per 5.\n\nThe damage on spellthief's is also something to consider however, and it is the only support gold item to give an offensive stats, with it's Unique Passive Tribute dealing 10/15 extra damage on more or less any damage procc whether it be an autoattack or a spell. And it actually offering low amounts of AP.\n\nSpellthief's is alos considered the best of the three at generating gold.\n\n\nFor sustain/disengage supports: Ancient coin\n\noffers... base mana regen, and a unique passive which offers low amounts of health upon adjacent enemy minion death.\n\nUpon upgrading to Nomad's Medallion, you also get some health regen added into the mix along with 10 flat movespeed, one of the only sources of flat movement speed outside boots (the only?)\n\nIn lane this is generally the weakest of the bunch, unless you really need the extra health regen and are ranged so proccing Relic shield is harder.\n\nMore than that, the real strength of this item line is in it's further build path, which is the strongest of the bunch including a Forbidden Idol, the cheapest source of CDR in the game as well as an easy 50% base mana regen, something utility supports will quickly find themselves in strong need of.\n\nSome of the champions who traditionally might want to build this also have higher base mana regen values ({{champion:16}} {{champion:37}} {{champion:40}} {{champion:267}} all have a base of 9 at lvl 1) and so benefit more from the high mana regen offered from the full item.\n\nThe other strength of this item is the incredibly versatile active AoE movespeed buff which Talisman of Ascension offers.\n\n\nWhat was my point again <.< ...........\n\nOh yeah..\n\nAnyway, the relic shield line offers proportionately way more to the champions who can use it well than the other items offer their users. In particular, the coin line sits as a peculiar middle ground between sustain and casting, with relic shield (and especially Targon's brace) offering way better sustain for your lane, while spellthief's edge/Frostfang helps out your poke and gives you AP while offering just as good mana regen (but no health sustain).\n\nI don't think the issue I have after this observation is with relic shield being too good in offering the tanky all-inners both the tanky stats they need to survive and the extra duo sustain to cover up their weaknesses. It's that the other items (in particular the coin line) doesn't offer enough similar coverage of their playstyle weaknesses.\n\nSpellthief's edge/Frostfang doesn't help you capitalize on your poke to eventually make a kill, it just makes each individual chunk of damage stronger. And builds gold easily on the right champions.\n\nAncient Coin/Nomad's Talisman doesn't offer you any extra disengage or aid to your survivability utilities (heals/shields/cc/etc.) when being jumped upon.\n\nWhile Relic Shield/Targon's Brace offers you an excelent cover for your weakness in dealing with heavy poke.\n\nCurrently, the disparity is subtle, but there's no wonder that when tanky all-in champions are good they're *very* on top.\n\nBecause their playstyle offers a higher reward potential, and the items supporting their playstyle does it better than the other playstyles' items.\n\nI think that's it?'\n\n---\n\nNo wait, there's more!\n\nIIRC, the ranking on the gold generation of items puts spellthiefs at the top and relic shield/targons at the bottom.\n\nWhich ends up meaning little in the long run, since the main kind of items relic shield user may want are defensive items, which are by nature cheaper than the offensive items a poke/damage support with spellthief's might want...\n\nThat should be it...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mandang0","date":"2015-05-08T22:15:19.487+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Have all of my upvotes!

I wasn't suggesting using her Q as poke.  And using monsoon as sustain is a bit far fetched to me, its too important just to use it to heal up your adc.\n\nYou're saying that all-in counters sustain and sustain counters poke, so Janna should be bad vs all-in and good vs poke you're saying?\n\nBut if someone tries to all-in Janna she knocks them up with Q , shields the adc and uses her W to slow.  If she's able she can even flash monsoon them under her own tower or something really nasty.  I see that working out for Janna's team but i might be wrong.\n\nVersus poke is Janna strong?  I'm not sure, i mean she can shield the poke if she has her timing down, but she has no reliable way to heal the adc or herself back up if the poke lands.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Remlap1223","date":"2015-05-08T23:16:05.548+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"It is a sad state of affairs when off-meta picks are the keys to unhinging the support trifecta that is going on right now (Leona, Morgana, and Thresh.)  We're now seeing stuff like Nautilus support, and the all-in support role is continued to be the one that is favored the most by both Riot, and the metagame.  \n\nA long time ago, while messing around in TeamBuilder, I decided to play support GP for shits and giggles.  I main GP, so I already had a general idea how I would build him as a support (tanky poke support with Targon's brace), and what I discovered basically hard countered EVERYTHING META.\n\n****\n\nMorgana, who was known for her obnoxious snare more than anything, all of a sudden had a man with a magnificent mustache who's name wasn't Braum, walking in front of her snares and tanking them, and proceeding to cleanse them, completely relegating Morgana as an anti-magic damage shield support, which was kind of a moot point against an ADC, and Gangplank, who leveled his Q and E first for supportin' purposes, and basically said \"use your shield, IDGAF\" and bullying Morgana and her carry out of the lane.\n\nLeona has been a terror bot lane since the balance favoring All-In supports for quite some time, and then all of a sudden Leona's #1 factor for playing her, her burst and diving potential, just came under threat.  Pretty much any champion that didn't have poke or an escape plan was Leona's bitch, and with the advent of Morgana meta, her #1 solution to that was to simply ban Morgana.  And then I took GP bot instead.  And it did virtually the same thing.  Leona isn't very discriminate about her targets, she'll pretty much nuke anyone that comes in her tether range.  And I used that to my advantage.  Launching to me, Leona proceeds to stun me, and have her carry try to take me down.  And I proceed to ignore that stun and start wailing on her.  Not \"poke\", full on chasing her down with auto attacks and Q's.  All of a sudden, Leona lost all of her sticking power, and was left to her W, but the combined assault of two attack damage champions caused the flash, exahust, and heal to go off.  Leona's only form of \"supporting\" her carry was invalidated by one ability.  If she tried to go after the carry instead, I'd just keep chasing her, and my carry would kite her to death.  If the enemy carry went in, I'd turn my attention to them, who now would have a support with all of their abilities on cooldown, and no means to peel or tank for them.\n\nAnd finally, Thresh.  Oh man, I feel like a horrible person for this, but GP bot lane makes Thresh players cry.  I remember the first time the enemy Thresh typed in all chat wondering how I completely invalidated his Q.  And that's pretty much how support GP works against Thresh.  Once level 2 comes, you sit in front of your carry, you tank all of his hooks and cure them away, and you relegate Thresh as a poke support with awful range.  Thresh's pitiful starting armor made it HILARIOUSLY easy to poke him out of lane, and if he actually was able to go in on the carry somehow, I'd just start wailing on him.  If he pulled the carry closer, I'd turn my attention to them instead.  If he tossed out the lantern for the jungler, I'd brunt the impact or absorb their CC.\n\nAnd then I hit level 6, and start supporting other lanes with my ultimate, instantly turning what would have been lost trades into winning ones, and racking up assists like I was UberDanger playing full AD Soraka with SOTO (actually got fed in lane once and rushed SOTO, got twenty stacks by endgame, and my carry STILL had more kills than me).\n\n****\n\nTeal Deer, sometimes solving balance problems that Riot isn't addressing requires you to get creative.  If that means taking an Olaf'd top laner bot lane as an AD support to hard counter the trifecta that has a stranglehold down there, than so be it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Troy242621","date":"2015-05-11T10:56:58.656+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Reminds me of something.
