It's no secret. People want a duck in Summoner's Rift. Not a duck champion, just a duck that can swim around in the river. I think this is a cool idea, but I know that a simple graphic change might not be enough to sway Riot's design team, so I have a proposal. We have all these jungling objectives, but I think we should have an objective that you interact with by NOT Smiting and killing it. So, here's my suggestion.\n\nThere are two ducks. One of them on the top river and one of them on the bottom river. They swim around and if you click on them, you begin to charge in order to \"capture\" it, similar to altars in Dominion. If you capture it, the duck begins to swim a bit faster, and it grants you vision with the same range as a trinket on its location. A mobile, uncontrollable ward. How cool would that be? The duck would have a light above its head to indicate that it was being used by the other team, so the counterplay here is \"pay attention to the duck and don't gank when it can see you\". Additionally, you'd be revealed while capturing, and that would make it an objective that could be easily contested. This would help junglers establish control over their preferred spot of the map and help prevent counter-ganking. Strong duck control would be a useful tool, but a dangerous risk as it instantly reveals your location to the laners and also to any roaming mids. Top duck and bottom duck would also become very strong at late/early game respectively, due to its undeniable vision granted of Baron and Dragon.\n\nIf the duck is captured by the other team, it is locked under their control for the first 45 seconds, similar to Twisted Treeline altars. Capturing a duck grants you control over it for up to 120 seconds, after which point it will stop granting vision until it is captured again (unless the enemy team captures it themselves after the first 45 seconds).\n\nWhat do you guys think? Interesting idea? Terrible? Any suggestions for how to make it better?","replies":[{"poster":"RiotForScience","date":"2014-10-03T16:40:23.903+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":1,"body":"interesting idea","replies":[{"poster":"Stüdmuffin","date":"2014-10-08T07:58:43.791+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is a brilliant idea.\nBumping for further Riot consideration, please!

That way, a team would need to control the enemy's jungle on both sides in order to have full duck control; there would be opportunities for counterplay if, say, the enemy controlled your red buff side jungle, but you could sneak in while duck was on blue buff side and steal it away, giving you a chance to get enough vision to go and counter-ward (many teams snowball off of forced facechecks as it is, and this could provide an opportunity to counter that)\n\nI also agree that true vision would be a bad idea, since it would shut down Eve/Twitch/Shaco/etc., but, like, what if the duck quacked/flapped (audiovisual cues) when a ward was within its vision range? (Maybe not anything invisible, that might be too much for champs which rely on invisibility, so maybe just wards)  \nNot a pinpoint, but a general heads-up for teams attempting to reclaim vision control, so they'd have a better chance at sniffing out enemy wards?  Both teams would be able to see/hear the duck's audiovisual cues, which would give opportunities for counter-counterplay, with teams setting up duck ganks in anticipation of potential approaching champions looking to secure vision.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Hyrum Graff","date":"2014-10-03T13:48:44.647+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"I love the idea of a vision-based objective. I think it would really help highlight the importance of vision control.\n\nThat being said, in its current implementation, you're essentially granting the winning team two extra wards in important locations. It turns warding the river back into a gold war, like in s3, which I don't think is very good gameplay.\n\nWhat if the ducks worked like altars in TT? Capture a duck, and it's locked to your team for 45 seconds.After that, the other team can capture it in the same way. You're revealed during capture.","replies":[{"poster":"The Yetii Rider","date":"2014-10-03T15:21:08.599+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"There we go, I edited to show your idea.

If there's something like this on the map, it should only be one.\n\nFrom my understanding, PBE is currently showing two crabs/ducks, one for top and one for bot. This seems slightly excessive since it leaves very small openings to gank with if your enemy has the duck-- and they can claim it fairly easily after a single fight. Adding ANOTHER \"duck\" in the jungle would make any sort of roaming almost impossible. Roam champs would be totally shut down.\n\nI could see the dual-ducks currently in use being valid if they implemented an item equivalent to a Smoke of Deceit or a Shadow Blade, but those might be a bit TOO strong, as they'd largely invalidate existing wards unless you had pinks up. The biggest issue with the ducks is how amazingly strong they are-- especially given the 45-second lock, which means that you can't be dewarded for that time.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"dialMARK4acti0n","date":"2014-10-03T16:12:10.332+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think this would change up the metagame WAY TOO MUCH.\n\nThat being said...
