That&#039;s exactly right. Rengar has already delivered on all the aspects you could want out of a feral hunter type champion. He feels like a skilled, predatory beast and his leap and roar are very animalistic. If you don&#039;t find something to really differentiate Warwick from Rengar, this rework is going to fall flat both gameplay-wise and thematically.\n\nSo yes, thinking about Warwick, I definitely want to see more of a violent character. The Hyena skin really encompasses what I like most about Warwick. His auto attacks are wild and all over the place, and his running on all fours is perfect to the idea of a werewolf lost in the hunt.\n\nViolence is key, but you should also emphasize that Warwick **has no control.**\n\nPerhaps this wasn&#039;t part of Warwick&#039;s original design, but Rengar didn&#039;t exist when Warwick came out. Rengar is cold, calculated, and vicious. He has the strength of an animal but the intelligence of a man. Warwick needs to differentiate that by being unable to cling to what&#039;s left of his humanity. Playing Wawrick should feel wild and dangerous. The player him/herself should be afraid of the monster they are controlling. \n\nThe game is 13+, I think, so you should be able to show some blood, right? Even though you cleaned it off a lot of splash arts, I think this is the champion that needs it the most. You have Darius bleeding his enemies out after all. Warwick needs something similar. Maybe when he has three stacks on an enemy that enemy becomes bloody and scarred for the duration of the passive.\n\nI remember the last time Warwick was up for a rework you were planning to keep the AP ratio on his Q because there was concern that making him AD focused would create similar drain-tank problems to Aatrox. That&#039;s understandable, but maybe a better solution is to simply restrict his healing to jungle monsters altogether? You could make Warwick have a higher damage potential if he simply didn&#039;t have the extra longevity in his kit against champions, which would make him a much better ganker since he wouldn&#039;t be so reliant on his teammates for damage.\n\nAnd then we get to his W. The skill that is lauded by pro players as providing the most free gold worth of stats to a team in the game. This skill definitely should be scrapped entirely and replaced with something more interesting and impactful. In the previous Warwick rework, we saw that it was a point blank AOE fear similar to Volibear&#039;s Majestic Roar except that it could affect champions.\n\nI think this idea could work. To make it better differentiated from Volibear and Rengar, you would need an ear-piercing, haunting howl to accompany it, rather than a roar or a scream. Something that shows a man pining for his true form, something wistful and lonely but also bloodthirsty.\n\nWarwick&#039;s proposed rework E was a dash from one location to another and then back again that could go over walls. It was tuned so that when he was at the other point, for a split second, he could W and Smite, so that he could basically contest objectives over walls. This was made significantly easier by his E passive also being changed to show monsters below 50% health as well, so even red and blue buffs could be contested by the Feral Hunter. \n\nThis change would make Warwick into an insane control jungler that takes more skill than Nunu or Skarner. I approve of it whole-heartedly. \n\nAnd finally, his ultimate. This is the skill that really has the most potential for violence. I urge Riot to cast aside the instinct that this is a kid&#039;s game and really embrace what video games have become from a graphics perspective. Every claw slash, every rip and tear, should have a serious pain-inducing sound effect, and his claws should swing in broad, unpredictable arcs that show him not slashing, but pulling the skin off his target. Like a beast desperate to get at the enemy&#039;s heart.","replies":[{"poster":"Dububby","date":"2016-09-01T02:39:45.238+0000","up_votes":73,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=The Yetii Rider,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=9e9wwANE,comment-id=,timestamp=2016-09-01T01:51:18.060+0000)\n\n> Violence is key, but you should also emphasize that Warwick **has no control.**\n\n>make Warwick into an insane control jungler\n\n???","replies":[{"poster":"underscores222","date":"2016-09-01T06:46:03.207+0000","up_votes":25,"down_votes":1,"body":"Different types of control\nThe first use is in reference to his personality and physical/mental state.

I learned on nocturne, and when I made the switch to udyr (who was pretty god tier at the time) I couldn't gank for shit. That's because noc has absolutely free ganks with his ult and a targeted fear (this was back when fear caused random movement, so it was a hell of a lot better). The same thing will happen if you make some learn the jungle on warwick.

It would enhance is theme and flavor, allow for some neat gameplay, give him a powerful tool to control of the jungle, while also being decent utility in general and a counter to stealth!

When Shen has an already rapidly dropping win rate and he gets nerfed, pretty soon we're going to see no play from him. For goodness' sake, people expected to see buffs because of how weak his laning phase is and how underpowered his ultimate shield is for a 2 minute cooldown.

And saying that Shen &quot;happens to work well in the meta&quot; is a huge understatement, he was 100% P/B in EU LCS and still had a great winrate in those games in which teams thought they could counter him.\n> He is very much dominant.\n\nYasuo's win rate spiked to 61% and other ridiculous numbers in Platinum in your region before the bug fix, back when people were using his bruiser build. Now he also gets extra damage due to a bug, and he has even less counterplay to his already unhealthy kit and people still deny how strong he is. \"SoloQ Stompers\" are defined as champions who are good at punishing mistakes and take high levels of knowledge about the game to beat. Yasuo is an all-around stomper, as he practically outscales every top laner in the game with his bruiser build and game-breaking bug. The only reason Yasuo isn't played in LCS is because the damage carry meta dictates that teams take engage, disengage, burst, and utility to support a scaling ADC. Yasuo provides minimal engage/disengage power besides his wind wall, and teams at the pro level are afraid to bring in such a volatile pick because they would rather pick a stale meta pick they know works rather than something as wild-card as Yasuo in this meta. On the other hand, Shen is a champion who has always been good at snowballing bot lane because of his global presence, but that's almost all he has. His laning phase is extremely punishable and easily counterable, and his jungle clear isn't good enough to compete with professional pick junglers like Gragas or Rek'sai.\n\n> You somehow had the idea that you could teach the pros how to play against Shen..\n\nPlease quote where I said any such thing, and if it was my comment about null-magic mantle, let me clear that up for you before you go straw-manning this discussion:\n\n>I don't know why pro players don't do this, but a null-magic mantle would completely win them trades against Shen if he's even giving them trouble.\n\nNote how I say that null-magic mantle would win them TRADES IF Shen is giving them trouble. Post level 6, Shen becomes a roamer, which gives his lane opponent the options of following him with TP or pushing his tower and creating map pressure in his absence. This means they won't be trading much with Shen anyway, and I realize that they have their item priorities higher than that.

The art of melee kiting has been lost but warwick is one of the last to possess it with his sustain/constant movespeed mechanics.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"It Hertz When IP","date":"2016-09-01T15:31:47.417+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm just waiting for a champion rework/new release that uses neither a 3/4 hit passive NOR a %max/%curr/%missing HP ability.","replies":[{"poster":"PB4UAME","date":"2016-09-01T23:33:47.777+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, current WW has both a %max hp ability (one of the very first in the game) and the first %missing health ability (iirc) in his Blood Scent.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"rtbf225618241","date":"2016-09-01T14:53:13.621+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think you're pushing uncontrollable ridiculously difficult to grasp theme with his kit too far. The skill floor has to stay the same and someone who has many variables in their kit isn't usable in low elo at all.\n\nAlso, your last suggestion is completely useless in my opinion. Sion's reworked lines are questionably bad enough, and ripping people to shreds visually isn't approvable in this game by many policies because it would get too disturbing for many reasons such as seeing female/childlike champions literally torn apart or your favorite champion like that,\n\nit's far too disturbing simply because of the level of detail itself already. At best, a bleeding effect would suffice or some kind of a finishing move similar to Darius' ultimate with the blood splash thing. I think by \"violence\" they meant constant basic attack range-melee interaction rather than some visual gore overhaul comprised with an all over the place kit that you're thinking.\n\nIf you want gore or whatever, there are plenty other games for that. This is still PG 12 unfortunately.\n\nEDIT:\n> really embrace what video games have become from a graphics perspective.\n\nWhat does that even mean?
