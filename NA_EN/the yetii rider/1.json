The other day I was playing Cho&#039;gath mid for the first time in months and I pressed /t. Then I did it again, and again, and again.\r\n\r\n&quot;Death is not the end for you. I have seen to it. For eternity, you are MINE!&quot;\r\n\r\nNow, obviously one of the best parts about this line is the voice acting. I can&#039;t use italics or bolds to describe it, but the speed of the transition from the first second to the second, the emphasis placed on &#039;you&#039; and &#039;mine&#039;, and the way the word &#039;death&#039; stretches on for half a second are all fantastic. \r\n\r\nEven so, Riot&#039;s story team wrote this line. And they have lots of other good ones!\r\n\r\nAnnie: &quot;What&#039;s your favorite aminal, a bear?&quot; - Adorable, childlike, and all of her lines have a giggle that reflects her age and is also unsettling without being creepy.\r\n\r\nIrelia: &quot;You rely on your weapons too much. Try letting GO!&quot; - Her voice gets angrier as she builds it up, and the animation that goes along with it is perfect.\r\n\r\nVi: &quot;Why can&#039;t I ever get a straight answer? It&#039;s always &#039;Oh no, stop hitting me! Ow, my face!&#039;&quot; - I admit, the voice acting is FLAWLESS on this one, but the line itself is also hilarious and on point.\r\n\r\n\r\nThen you&#039;ve got the kind of meh lines.\r\n\r\nEzreal: &quot;Noxians...I hate those guys&quot; - I am honestly not sure how this is supposed to be a joke. It&#039;s not a pun, it&#039;s not intentionally awkward like Diana, it&#039;s just there.\r\n\r\nTeemo: &quot;Size doesn&#039;t mean everything.&quot; Sure, it&#039;s kind of amusing with what it&#039;s referencing, but the character is a PTSD war vet with poison and the potential for drug references. Lots of good options here, but a generic short joke isn&#039;t using them.\r\n\r\nSoraka: &quot;No, I&#039;m not happy to see you. Yes, that IS a horn growing out of my head.&quot; - Okay, Soraka&#039;s other joke is hilarious but this one is low brow, it doesn&#039;t make a lot of sense (how would you even suggest that her exposed horn could be confused for an erection?) and more importantly, it drags on too long for not a lot of payoff. \r\n\r\nSo, what taunts and jokes do you guys appreciate the most? Riot definitely nails it more often than they phone it in, so this is an appreciation thread of Riot&#039;s best lines.","replies":[{"poster":"Leadpaintchips","date":"2015-12-12T19:47:15.778+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:36}} \"Mundo says his own name a lot, because Mundo forgets.

What I perhaps like the most is the contrast that appears when playing against them, after you have played as them. \n\nWhen you play as them they seem playful, if in a creepy way, Lamb reciting poetry and dancing around even as Wolf constantly wants to chase people as his way of having fun. It is wonderfully depicted and sometimes almost makes me forget they are the personifications of death. \n\nBut then you play against them and occasionally when you take a mark, they might talk to you and even the usually calm Lamb sounds quite angry about you taking away their target. It reminds me constantly of what they really are. \n\nAnother of my favorite moments is how, once the death timers get long enough, they might use the time when dead to recite the basics of their origin. My absolute favorite line from that is the end: \n\nWolf: \"So he would always have a friend?\"\nLamb: \"So he would always have a friend.\" \n\nI don't know if it is just me, but Wolf sounds almost uncertain or questioning in that line, at least it sounds like that to me and Lamb sounds more reassuring than normal, in a way that just seems very heartwarming. It really makes me feel that despite Wolf's desire to chase, he seems quite scared to be separated from Lamb, this along with his \"How long will we be together?\" answered by Lamb's \"Forever more.\"\n\nThere just seems to be so much character for both of them in the voice acting and lines, so many things you might glean about both of them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Yetii Rider","date":"2015-12-12T20:42:13.819+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh, it's another Jones reference.
