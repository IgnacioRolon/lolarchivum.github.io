Is it just there to make us feel better?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-24T18:35:30.094+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"These reports actually help a lot!  While an account can be marked by leaverbuster, these reports also help us prioritize who we look at.  As an example, they can help us tackle players who are intentionally leaving games or trying to game the system for the purpose of griefing and causing negative experiences to others.  That is something that a lower priority queue won't resolve.  Thanks for keeping the community fair!","replies":[{"poster":"The Yetii Rider","date":"2016-08-24T18:39:36.316+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for the swift answer.
