On top of that his ult is 100% non-combat meaning he doesn't get a level 6 spike like many other champions (and is honestly extremely weak to use until you get a second rank in it, frankly I almost wonder if it is better to simply skip leveling it until you hit level 10, that way the moment you hit 11 you get 2 ranks in it and it actually becomes useful), also in order to even take advantage of his ult your team requires some extremely good coordination and timing to pull off properly.\n\nIf anything I think his new ult was a mistake and that it is the root cause of his terrible winrate.

When facing a lane against Ryze and you happen to be an immobile champion (something that he is good against), then you need to itemize for sustain earlygame.  Ryze burns through mana like it was water while poking, and it takes him a long time to get it back so if you can sustain through it you can farm and take him out.  Don't bother trying to trade with Ryze unless he really screws up his positioning, and abuse bushes as much as you can to prevent poke and get farm.  Stay in the bush until a minion is low enough for you to take out and if you have to use abilities to farm then do so (ESPECIALLY if you are manaless or your spells cost insignificant amounts of mana).\n\nLet him push up, because Ryze is EXTREMELY vulnerable to ganks, and top lane is the easiest lane to gank for.  If your lucky and you actually got a good jungler that knows how to gank you can generally obliterate him with a couple good ganks.

The next reworks are Galio and Warwick, and I hope some of the ones shortly after that will be Urgot and Mordekaiser. But after those get looked at, I think that Kalista should be close to the top of the list of champions that desperately need reworks. Azir, as well. \n\nMany of the champs from that time period were just crazy overloaded. They are high skill-cap champs that have too many moving parts to ever be balance-able. I think Riot just underestimated player's ability to master a kit, mainly. It's tough, but a lot of people can put a lot of time into this game, and overloaded kits will just continually lead to broken champs. \"Trimming\" the power from them only leaves them unplayable. They need to be reworked from the ground up into something that can actually be balanced.\n\nI don't put Aatrox into that camp, though, which I think is part of the reason I don't consider him to be as bad. He's got issues, but I don't feel the \"overloaded\" nature of kits like Azir and Kalista really share an underlying problem with champs like Aatrox. \n\nAatrox seems more like Mordekaiser to me; they are both in the \"drain tank\" type of category, where they just can't be killed if they get ahead.

I joined league after her nerfs stopped coming so I cant speak with fear about the broken state she used to be in. Now onto my thoughts. Kalista as a champion has a serious problem - her lore identity is very different than her gameplay identity. In the **lore** her identity is basically her W and her R. Her **Gameplay** identity is her passive and her E. I play her for her game play identity because I enjoy jumping around and ripping spears out of people. I do not believe this two sides can coexists and be balanced at most levels of play. However the side of kalista that should be removed if any is the lore identity. I know that many see her as an unhealthy champion and someone who \"can never be balanced\". This is kind of true with her current kit. I would hope that instead of working with interaction with the oath sworn we could work with her real identity. What i would do is nerf her autos even further and buff the damage of her rend while removing the reset on its cooldown when something is killed. I would like her passive to be buffed although after reading your comments I see that it may not be possible. What I'm getting at is kalista needs to be a high skill-cap adc which **relies on kitting and the damage of rend** With the lack of rend's reset I would hope that the cooldown would be kept the same or perhaps, Depending on the damage of the revisited rend maybe increased. This would mean that she could be punished for a bad rend and she couldn't just load a minion up with spears to get easy trades. Honestly for this next part remember that I am a kalista main and I acknowledge that this will be biased. For he Q I would like two things (both of which are a little unreasonable) I would like straight 100% AD scaleings with no bonus damage. Now to counter this I would like the spear to carry out all current functions but also have a chance to crit based on the skill's level and reset the cool down of rend on a champion kill. This seems overpowered because it negates the opportunity to take advantage of the missed damage on rend - However killing a champion with this skill is not easy and would add another element of skill into her kit. Honestly I have no idea what her other abilities would be, maybe a steroid for her jump or something... \n\nIf you actually read all of this I thank you, Please feel free to tell me where my ideas are stupid. {{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[{"poster":"The Yetii Rider","date":"2016-11-03T18:51:23.826+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean, all of that is fine but this thread is discussing Kalista's passive and how buggy it is.
