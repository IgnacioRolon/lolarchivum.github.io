It patched earlier, I assumed it was some sort of hotfix, but ever since then it's been freezing after a minute or two of being on, usually in champ select. When it does, I can still click buttons in the window (I can tell by the sound effects), but the window doesn't update, and out of four times I've tried it in bot games, only once have I successfully entered a game. During that game, my screen would routinely flash black.\r\n\r\nI'm on Windows 10 and have never had this kind of trouble with the client before. It's persisted through two client repairs, three hard resets, and adjusting my compatibility settings. Has anyone else had this problem, or have any suggestions for how I could fix it?","replies":[{"poster":"backseater77","date":"2016-11-11T15:07:16.977+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is there any solution for this?

What I did was reboot in safe mode, delete my video driver software, and reinstall it. It's a bit time-consuming, but not terribly difficult if you can find a tutorial on some non-afflicted internet device. Good luck!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Barachiel","date":"2016-10-01T22:26:22.567+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Update: I've now tried running League in Windows 7 compatibility mode, turned off the xbox DVR, deleted the xbox app, repatched league, repaired league, reinstalled league, and restarted my computer several times, and not a damned thing has changed. I'm seeing this problem pop up for other people on the boards, and I've tried all the fixes they've suggested, but to no avail. I can't revert to an earlier Windows build because my last update was more than ten  days ago, but that also means that my last Windows update couldn't have been the problem that caused this to happen.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-28T23:34:48.156+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm happy to be the first to respond to your first post!  :D  Freezing or crashing in champion select can be happening for several reasons, like third party programs or connection issues.  If you have any apps running like play.tv or overlays then remove them.  If your issue persists then you may need to double check your network for any issues and troubleshoot all through our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide.  This should get your issue fixed, but if you are totally freezing in-game please let me know as that's another issue.  I'll be around!","replies":[{"poster":"Barachiel","date":"2016-10-01T02:14:58.331+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have, as of thirty seconds ago, tried literally every option on the Hextech Repair Tool, and the problem persists. It's not just in champ select, it's in menus and even on the login screen. As long as the client itself is up, the client visually freezes after two or three minutes. To my knowledge, I have no third-party programs interacting with the LOL client in any way. I am officially out of ideas besides \"wait for the 6.20 patch and try again.\" I appreciate your quick response, though. If you have any other suggestions, I'm willing to try them.","replies":[]}]}]}
