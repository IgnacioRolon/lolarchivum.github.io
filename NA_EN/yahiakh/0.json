I have a brother who has the same exact Laptop and is playing smoothly with no freezing. I also get a big lag spike whenever I press O to view kills and stuff or whenever I try to see other tabs on my laptop by pressing Alt + Tab the screen is frozen on the LOL loading screen that isn't progressing and if I attempt to close it to reopen it I can't close it and have had to shutdown my laptop through the power button many times just to get rid of it.\r\nYour help will be kindly appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-20T00:22:59.667+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Some of your game files may not be working properly anymore for some strange reason.
