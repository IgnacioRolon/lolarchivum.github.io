But when I went to start another game, I found that I had leaver buster :\\ its only 5 minutes but its annoying that it was a server crash and I got penalized for it. What exactly could have happened AND can we get a way so that people aren't penalized when the game crashes?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-15T03:14:06.437+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like your connection to the game platform dropped entirely, causing the client to crash out.
