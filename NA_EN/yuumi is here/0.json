It look like first 30 seconds are good, but after 30 seconds it goes rapidly down to 30-40 fps, do you have the same problem guys? or some fix? (I tried everything, but nothing helped me). ty for feedback.","replies":[{"poster":"ScarfaceTony","date":"2018-02-08T14:44:26.189+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot, stop lying to us, now its a lot more clear. Ever sience the patch for Pre Season 8, fps drops for absolutely no reason have been happening and its totaly random weather it will happen to you or not. I have a decent laptop that was able to run league at full 140-200 fps depending on situations and the lowest I ever had was 60, until the preason patch, after that including now ive been dropping frames to 30 and even single digits and acording to third party apps it has nothing to do with league displaying things that require more power as the same effect happens exatly the same no matter the graphical settings or what is displayed on screen at the moment, the game works fine, and then it does not, for no reason. It has no corelation to the client and reinstalling has not helped. Also if your doubting the power of my laptop I can run Warframe at most settings maxed out except shadows and some anti-aliasing. Riot and mods has been gving us to solutions for this problems that are just outright lies that they came up to ignore the issue: Either outdated drivers, or client related bugs that can be resolved with reinstalling the games. Both of those have not worked and sience there have now 3-4 months sience this issue with no fixed I think honest that riot is just not caring about it. Altrough the issue seems to be absent from certain types of pcs, especially ones with more modern gpus and cpus the problem is not coming from specs. Most peopl that have this usse are either users with PCs that are medium in terms of specs and laptop users such as myself. Please optimize your game better riot","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-02T17:09:47.381+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A driver might be outdated or a bad game file could be causing a frame in drops.

Respectfully you can make up your own opinion, but look and go through all the threads posted just this month on this fps issue. Riots pr skills need a lot of work. They should atleast say something along the lines of \" we are aware of this issue that many are having , and we are currently working to resolve this issue\" would suffice. Not a redirect link to a fps help guide. Maybe if only a few had an issue regarding fps in the past month then fine, redirect them with that link. But come on, do I have to count all the threads pertaining to this in the past 2 weeks.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"theman1616161","date":"2017-05-02T16:24:00.773+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi there! This issue is popping up a lot with a lot of people. It seems to be a problem with Riot and the new client update. I assume this will be patched in the next patch for mid season ^^ don't worry it's not a problem with ur pc. If u play another game and test it you should see that your fps is still stable, this happened to me too.\n(sorry for bad English)\n{{champion:32}}","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-02T17:11:06.963+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The updated client is separate from the game, so it shouldn't have any impact on your experience while playing.
