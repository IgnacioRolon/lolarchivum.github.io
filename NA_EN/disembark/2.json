I know, autofill is annoying but honestly I get autofilled like less than 5% of my games. I also enjoy support so theres that. Loving SoloQ. \n\n\n**2) Hextech Crafting**\nOk, I for one LOVE hextech crafting. Legit I had 0 skins before and didn&#039;t care for them. But through hextech crafting I got skins I would NEVER get in my life (like blood moon thresh, spirit guard udyr) and it makes the game SO much more enjoyable and lets broke people have some skins too :). I look forward to playing champs i have skins for, and sometimes I only play a champ cuz i got a badass skin for it.\n\n**3) Rotating Game Modes**\n\nNot ALWAYS the best, but they&#039;re actually enjoyable a lot of the time. Its the perfect way to keep URF and All-For-One keep coming without them getting stale. There are improvements to be made but the idea is spectacular\n\n**4) PRETTY GOOD BALANCE**\nPeople say Lucian is OP, Graves is OP... ok maybe they&#039;re _strong_ but nothing is as OP as the shit you saw last season (for LONG periods of time)\n\n**Tank Ekko:** Build sunfire then just go dive every lane you please. Late game just split push and chase any squishy down to their nexus if they dare to even look at you from a mile away. Oh, you wanna gank him or 5 man him? Nvm hes gonna slow you all and get a movespeed buff. Oh yeah and hes super tanky too haha. Oh and teamfights you just stun people for 2.25 secs and half life everyone while taking 0 damage. Bad engage? Press R man! 59-60% w/r\n\n**Lucian:** You built ghostblade? Ok, you can now 1v2 bot lane. Not even kidding. I used to build ghostblade, hide in a bush and just 1 shot the adc, and then kill support too. JG shows up? Lul kill his ass too. 56-57% w/r\n\n**Jungle s6:** Oh guys we&#039;re 27-0 this should be an easy game. **Yi whos been power farming for 35 mins shows up**. Oh shit guys he has 3.5K hp with devourer and rageblade run before he 1shots our whole team. (Enemy Pentakill). \n\n**Jungle s7:** Oh shit guys lee sin is level 7 while bot lane is level 4. (Dove). Well guess i got outplayed there :) (fixed XP in jg)\n\nHonorable mentions: Zed (after QSS), Kog&#039;Maw (reverted), Malz (after mage rework, now gutted), Yasuo (triforce build).\n\nI know a lot of these fk ups are riot-created, but these shit plagued all of Season 6. Like there wasn&#039;t a week where something wasn&#039;t busted a shit.\n\n_Right now some champions are in the gutter, sure, BUT I&#039;d rather have 10 champs in the gutter than 10 champs broken as shit while other champs are balanced_\n\n**Honorable Mentions:**\nReplays\nSandbox mode (could be improved, ofc)\nNew skins are super cool and make me excited (project ashe, dark star thresh, god fist lee sin)","replies":[{"poster":"Penns","date":"2017-04-27T17:13:18.684+0000","up_votes":26,"down_votes":0,"body":">Lucian: You built ghostblade?

There's an effectively infinite possible combinations of champions and builds for any one player. A given game has _10_ players, but even that's not all of it. Every build is affected by what else is popular and what's expected, which all in turn effect each other, meaning something that has fairly reasonable numbers overall can be extremely broken simply because none of its counters work well with/against everything else that's popular atm. That's all a meta is: expectations and the play around those expectations.\n\nBy way of example, in a heavy tank/armor meta, the lethality meta would never've happened. When the other side has three 300 armor tanks, your 20 armor pen isn't nearly as effective as it is vs. a team of squishies with 40 armor.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Disembark","date":"2017-04-28T01:12:42.012+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Ok thats memey but its not true at all.

Ghostblade in season 7 was 20 LETHALITY, 60 AD, and JUST move speed. And it was STILL busted. \n\nLike you LEGIT 1v2'd the lane not by being smart or landing poke - just walk into lane, press active, run them both down. It was the most braindead shit ever (and I loved it xd)\n\nProblem with Bork RN is that it doesn't sacrifice late game like GB did.

Lee Sin has some solid counterplay and his numbers aren't insane. There's a reason you don't see him in literally every game. He's popular, yes, but he's in a solid place.\n\nUrgot is getting his much needed rework, and he even saw pro play last season to some success. One of the reasons they didn't act sooner is that his play rates were so low there were higher priorities.\n\n Aurelion Sol is fuckin strong right now, I don't know what you're seeing, he just has one of the highest learning curves in the game. \n\nKalista was straight up broken until they made her more reliant on her linked champion, and she still sees some solid play. Azir has little counterplay when he's strong, and yeah, he's pretty weak right now. As I said, balancing a roster of 150 champions is near-impossible.\n\nI think that for a game of this size, and the scope of the work they do, people do not appreciate the programming, art, and testing manpower required to do some of the things people expect. IT TAKES A TON OF TIME.\n I see a ton of \"Boohoo, my main isn't good right now\", get fucking over it. Diversify, play other champs. These are the same people who only play one dude, q up for ranked and then feed or rage because it gets picked/banned or they got autofilled into something else. Jeebus. Learn the whole game.

Lee sin has a 45-49% winrate from bronze to gold. \nDiamond to masters 51-55% not taking challenger into account since many winrates are flawed due to the lack of games like rammus with 70% winrate in challenger. (still 54 in 600 games)\nSo no low elo does certainly not abuse lee sin. \nWell literally every single game is a race for  graves or lee sin and since both have a pretty decent banrate, 15 and 20%, you don't see them every game. \nHe is not in a solid place he is straight up broken especially higher on the ladder his numbers show it, the fact that he is oh so mechanical intensive and falls off and what not. I just loosely quote riot on this about leblanc and zed with 10% playrate and barely 50-51% winrate: blabla mechanical champs with these numbers are way too strong. Zed and leblanc (old btw) at 45-47% winrate are balanced. \nBut lee sin is okay with 35% pickrate and 51-55% winrate in higher-high elo? \n\nPeople have all the right to complain when meta champs are just SO MUCH stronger than non meta champs. Jungle is a race for graves/lee all the time.

Hello olaf, sejuani, s6 zed, shen, malz. \nBut they have a problem with actually nerfing lee, graves, riven, ahri and the likes. \nIf azir wouldn't have been such an obvious problem he would still rampage from soloQ to lcs because he is entertaining and bla. \nLook at leblanc. How long do we have to wait till this shit get fixed. Half a year now she remains absolutely bullshit. \nKata? Still 31% banrate across all elos in the last 7 days and 40% in the last month.

Riot not only shouldn't, but **CAN'T** take anything meaningful away from that post.\n\n(also as a side note, personally attacking the person you're trying to talk to is really disrespectful and is also a concession of the argument itself, as you're effectively saying \"I can't think of a way to counter your point so I'll just call you names instead\", along those lines, it's also somewhat childish to show such hostility towards a person you don't even know just because they disagree with you)","replies":[{"poster":"Dextix LT","date":"2017-04-28T11:49:01.245+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"There is a difference between both, the problem is that fanboys of products lump those in together, in LOL included. I have seen far too much fully detailed critisism called bashing. \n\nAlso, like i said in the threads when ppl asked for SQ when DQ was the only available que.\n\nYou know what happened then? After a time people stopped making arguments and just started asking more and more vehemently. That was also called bashing and called \"having no arguments\". By that point people were tired of restating the same arguments over and over and over again. There is a breaking point when people are simply too tired of silence and ignoring everyone. \n\nTHAT is the problem. RIOT ignoring everything. And people are now at the breaking point where thy simply want Riot to listen no matter what.\n\nAlso its hard to be polite when i am basically told to fuck off if i dont like something, i have seen this bullshit in Runescape when they fucked it up, it does not end well, and such people ARE fanboys. When you are this invested in the game that you say that everyone who does not like it should leave, you ARE a fanboy, simple as that.","replies":[{"poster":"Skins Project","date":"2017-04-28T12:13:42.692+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Apologies if that came out wrong.\n\nAs I mentioned I was referring to the OG comment which stated.\n\n\"People who bash riot\" I don't refer bashing as spamming about XXX champion or writing long heart thought essays as to what you think should happen (I'm personally a fan of Mira) \n\nWhen I refer to bashing I mean the people who say things like \"I don't play the game anymore I just stay on boards to point out every mistake\"\n\nOr those who complain about an upcoming change just to realize that it wasn't as bad as they assumed.\n\nThink about the Mao bug even.

I mean after all I'm only wanting what I purchased, and after they destroy the champion I bought the skin for, that item is no longer what I purchased.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
