They point out their KDA, their cs/min, damage or whatever else.\n\nThe problem is, that having good stats does not inherently win you games. Your enemy&#039;s nexus does not explode if you have 0 deaths every game, or if you get 10 cs/min, or if you get a bunch of kills.\n\nIf you&#039;re an ADC, and get 10 cs/min - does it matter if you don&#039;t know how to properly teamfight and can&#039;t get your auto attacks in? Does it matter that you have so much CS, when the enemy ADC with 5 cs/min can still out-dps you in the teamfight or pose more of a threat? Or if you don&#039;t take the opportunities for finishing their main carries by playing up/aggressive? I don&#039;t think it does.\n\nIf you&#039;re a jungler, get a bunch of ganks off and a bunch of kills, does it matter if you create no pressure and continue to farm your jungle? Let the enemy jungler scale up or gank your winning lanes? Aren&#039;t there for the important moments when your team needs you? I don&#039;t think it does.\n\nI feel like having good CS and getting kills are a good step in increasing your ability to carry - but that&#039;s just it - if you don&#039;t know how to carry a game or use those advantages to get objectives, then it doesn&#039;t matter.\n\nThere are far too many elements to this game which allow you to carry a game. Reading your enemies and reading your team mates is very important.\n\n**TL;DR:** Being a good* player means you will have good stats. However, having good stats doesn't necessarily make you a good player.\n\n*good player: better than your elo.
