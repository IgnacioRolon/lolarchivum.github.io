Which ever one i choose it is always above 60, which seems to make my laptop to bottleneck the internet connection; the more in-game models there are on my screen the bigger ping i have (when i use my phone for tethering - no problem ).\n\nI have a Lenovo Z51 with a AMD Radeon R9 M375.\n\nThe second part about third party programs.\nThe \"Radeon Settings\" utility seems to have options that auto-detects games and allows me to change game settings, like FPS cap, V-sync anti-alias etc. \nThat also doesn't seem to work, And then i noticed that the utility picked up the game client not the game itself. So if i go and manually add the game *.exe in the utility - will that trigger a banable offence as a use of third party programs?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-13T17:11:26.819+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Our tech team may be able to provide some options for your specific issue.
