A few days ago, I started lagging intensely. Up to 90k+ ping!. I stopped playing games after that game. The next day, my first couple of games were fine. However, the two games after that, I got 250-500+ ping throughout the whole game. This has been going on for a few days. I do have a few people in the house that can be causing it, but that might not be the case since the issue just started a few days ago. I have checked on the boards but the solutions I tried would not work. BTW, I use wireless internet with a Netgear USB adapter that connects me to the internet if that might be causing the problem. I have been thinking about programs such as WTFast or Killping, but was not sure if they would be useful or not.\r\n\r\nAll help is appreciated! Thanks!\r\n\r\n-steveminer999","replies":[{"poster":"steveminer999","date":"2016-09-13T01:17:23.553+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have also been considering getting Kill Ping, which works for a lot of people and not for some. I have tried WTFast before but decided to stop using it since it made me crash in one of my games and wouldn't allow me to reconnect. However, Kill Ping has been seeming to get good reviews if you are having issues with latency. Would you recommend something like that if I am unable to connect to ethernet?","replies":[]},{"poster":"steveminer999","date":"2016-09-13T00:41:15.200+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am young, and I am in a room that does not have a router. My parents do not have any plans to move the router or my stuff so i can connect an ethernet cable to the router. I have discussed it with them and they said it is possible to get a really long ethernet cable, but we currently do not have any plans to go anywhere to buy it. It also seems I am lagging specifically on League of Legends and on other online games such as CS:GO, I do not seem to lag. Could it be because of me connecting to the Rito servers?\n\nThanks!\n\n-steveminer999","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-12T21:52:22.302+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"High latency to the servers is usually the result of local network settings and given your context, the first step I would try is using an Ethernet cable to wire directly into your modem/router and bypass your WiFi connection. WiFi is super convenient, but it often causes issues for games or applications that require great latency and minimal packet loss like League. \n\nIf you continue to have issues after getting off WiFi, please let me know.","replies":[]}]}
