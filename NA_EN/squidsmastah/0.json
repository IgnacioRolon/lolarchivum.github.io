(NOT A \"NERF THUNDERLORD'S\" RANT)","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":29,"down_votes":18,"body":"So it&#039;s obviously the damage meta, so armor and magic resist is worthless since even the supports build damage. At first it started to get crazy, then it began to calm down........ until this happened. \n\nhttp://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/5/58/Thunderlord%27s_Decree_mastery_2016.png/revision/latest?cb=20151103094742\n\nThis just made the damage meta fly way out of control. I mean, it&#039;s FREE DAMAGE! Who doesn&#039;t want that? I&#039;m guilty myself for picking this mastery. I have 20 mastery pages and 16 of them have Thunderlord&#039;s on them. Also the past champion releases:\n\n{{champion:203}} {{champion:420}} {{champion:223}} {{champion:78}} (Poppy can be considered a new champ since her rework was so damn big)\n\nThese 4 champions are good at a certain thing: dealing damage. Illoai with that popular video where the player ults and without stress solos the entire enemy team all at once. Tahm Kench who can deal just about as much damage as he can take. Kindred who deals massive amounts of %health damage. Poppy who with one combo can take out half your health. \n\nAnd lets not forget the new DAMAGE item coming out that makes every melee assassin another Zed. There are a lot champs that CANNOT stay in their current state for the release of the &quot;New Assassin Dagger&quot;:\n\n{{champion:238}} Just because you get 2 ults at the same time\n{{champion:91}} Already does enough damage, and won&#039;t have to try as hard with the new item\n{{champion:35}} We all know this will end badly\n{{champion:107}} (See the above)\n{{champion:157}} Already unhealthy and this item will officially break him\n{{champion:11}} The true damage is enough, we don&#039;t need %health damage involved\n{{champion:64}} Don&#039;t even get me started on the chaos that would happen\n\nNot only will this item be enforcing the damage meta EVEN FURTHER, it will make an even more unhealthy environment for the game. \n\nAlso the reason why people are also so toxic, is because it does get just a _little_ annoying when you constantly get 100-0d by everything that moves in this game.\n\nAlso I remember, Riot, you guys saying that you wouldn&#039;t forcefully create a meta? What happened to that hmm? \n\nSo releasing more things that deal more damage is just bad for the players, it&#039;s bad for the game, and it&#039;s just bad all around. Please Riot, can we start putting more variety into the releases of new things? Like, I don&#039;t know, a new support item, a new support champion, a new tank item, something that isn&#039;t solely meant to have a lot of damage in their/its kit?\n\nAnyway thank you for taking the time to read this thread.

Maw... not enough AD in my opinion, and the shield never procs );\nRav is amazing - I am pretty sure you have no idea what ur talking about. Rav is an animation cancel that does about the same dmg as an auto attack - this greatly adds to your burst combo, about another 300 dmg. In a recent uh, Redmercy vidya, I think, he shows that apparently you can Rav in mid air, adding even more dmg. \n\n{{item:3812}} Is amazing though. But bleeding out from it... almost makes it not worth it :P\n\nWith this build ur much more of a teamfighter with Armor shred, AoE, etc. 1v1'ing is still easy because of the Iso Q, but being a hard to kill assassin has it's benefits.","replies":[{"poster":"Puppet33r","date":"2015-12-30T21:59:35.866+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's the thing.

Or, better yet, catch enemies transitioning from one lane to another in their jungle so you can burst them while they are isolated.

What matters is the numerical tuning of each option and whether they consistently follow the same paradigm of balance. \n\nIntroducing new champions that deal significant damage as a part of their role is not any kind of issue. They need to be balanced, obviously, so that the general damage curve they will achieve in a game is suitable towards their role and they are always trading off one strength for damage. Maybe Illaoi passes some threshold of absurdity in her damage scaling. Maybe Tahm Kench doesn't have significant enough trade-offs in his kit. I have little perspective to judge the balance of these things at the moment while I'm stuck shitting around in ARAMs due to reasons, but in an ideal state of balance all they are doing is replacing another champion in the game who would either deal similar kinds of damage or offer significant advantages elsewhere.\n\nSimilarly, more damage items do not automatically equal more damage overall in the game. Maybe for a couple of patches if they are overtuned, but otherwise you're picking them instead of a different damage item.\n\nOf course AD assassin's can't stay the same if a new item for them comes to play. They also can't stay the same when any existing item which works with them  receives any kind of balance adjustment. When you introduce a new option you cobble the hell out of it until it fits the intended purpose.
