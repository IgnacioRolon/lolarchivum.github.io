A Nasus that sacrifices his stacks to \"help\" will end up being useless anyway by either being a mediocre tank that doesn't do enough damage to be a threat or a mediocre bruiser that does decent damage but dies too quickly. \n\nIn my opinion, \"helping\" your team doesn't need to mean getting involved in the teamfights (which vs certain comps, Nasus sucks at anyway). Helping can also involve staying top and farming, while sending a message to your enemies that \"If you don't come and stop me you're gonna lose turrets, inhibs, and eventually your nexus\". The catch 22 of this is, they either send their strongest team member to stop you (good for your team) or send 2 people to stop you (good for your team).","replies":[{"poster":"MoonToonEx","date":"2016-04-11T13:51:07.232+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Or they do the smart thing and stump your team 5v4 before sending people to deal with you.\nI've found that the best way to deal with Susan is to take his afk farming as a chance to run over his team in team fights so that you can push obj and lanes. It's useless to have your top just stay up there all game cause riot felt that even if you crap on him early game it would be a good idea if the game last long enough he'll just outscale you no matter what.","replies":[{"poster":"Need Gold 4 Tent","date":"2016-04-11T14:46:03.825+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Taking a turret from a turtling 4 is not as easy as you think, unless of course they make a positioning mistake which you capitalize on (which I;ll concede, happens 90% of the time). We had a 5v4 before (enemy jungle DC'd), and ended up standing uselessly near their inhibitor turret for a good 5 minutes because nobody could do anything. \n\nThe Sivir cleared the waves almost instantly and the Janna shielded the turret, all while a fed Nid was poking our team apart from behind. You can only dodge so many spears before one of them hits you and you have no choice but to back because you're now at 1/4 hp. We won that because well... 4v5.\n\nYou will then only have so big a window to siege before you will have to go after him, because if you only go after him when he starts whacking on a turret, you ain't gonna make it. And not forgetting that if you bluepill at different times, the remaining members are open to the now fair 4v4 or even 4v3. They're not gonna let you all back in peace, that's when the chasing will start. \n\nI find, the way that is more effective (much to my annoyance sometimes because it is occasionally MY OWN TEAM'S fault), is to bring the party to whatever lane he's at. Leave the enemy 4 and aggressively push HIS lane. It's easier to dive 1 person than 4 people, even if he's a tank. When my team suddenly decides \"Oh, let's follow Susan for absolutely no reason at all\", and my peaceful farm gets disturbed by another 9 people, allies taking my cs and enemies zoning me from them. \n\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}}","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Gentleman Gems","date":"2016-04-11T21:44:48.839+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:44}}: \"Look you need to help us, plus (Fun Fact) you get more stacks from killing Champions and these guys look squishy.\"\n{{champion:75}}: \"MORE STACKS!!!\"\n{{champion:67}}: Yah like Taric said, but-\n**Penta{{champion:75}}Kill** \"I like stacks, lets get stacks from Dragon and Baron.\"\n{{champion:67}}: \"WTF YOU STOLE MY PENTA YOU LITTLE-\"\n{{champion:75}}: _Angry_ \"You mean my stacks...\" _Prepares Super Q_\n{{champion:67}}: _Quivering_ \"Yah, your stacks, sorry, hey leys get Drag and Baron.\"\n{{champion:75}}: _Panting_ \"Yes, Dragon and Barons stacks sound fun\"\nEnemy {{champion:81}}: \"Guys, we need to stop them\"\n{{champion:75}}: _Uses Q_ \"Stacks.\" \n{{champion:75}} has slain {{champion:36}} \nEnemy {{champion:81}}: _Turning around_ \"Guys we need to run back and Defend\"\n\n_And that game, Nasus learned that enemy champion gave even more Stacks, and he loved it_\n_Ps.
