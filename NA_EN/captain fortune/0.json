Yesterday the game worked fine. Today, when I try to start the launcher Windows 8 does the typical procedure of asking if I want to allow the program to make changes to the computer, so I click yes, then after a brief delay my computer promptly powers down. I have narrowed the power down issue to the launcher, because it occurs every time I try to start the launcher.\n\nAlso note that no shut down procedures of programs closing, etc, occurs. Screen just goes black and the tower's fans turn off. And this happened within a few minutes of turning my computer on for the first time of the day, and I've got a great cooling system, so overheating is not even a semblance of a possibility.\n\nI'm thinking some client files got corrupted, so i want to try to reinstall the program, but the application isn't listed in my control panel so I can't uninstall it.\n\nSome desktop PC Specs:\nNvidia 980TI GPU\nIntel Core i7 4790K\n16GB ram\nASUS Maximus VII Ranger motherboard\n\nIs there an uninstall utility or other technique I can use to try reinstalling the game? Does anyone have any suggestions on how to fix this problem?\n\nThank you.\n\nEDIT: I do not use LOLrecorder and have never installed it or any other LOL recording programs on this computer.","replies":[{"poster":"Digital Ram","date":"2016-01-22T23:44:40.615+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Fortune 500,\n\nThat does sounds pretty strange. Running the Uninstall Utility through Windows Control Panel should be sufficient for removing the game, but it sounds like you may be experiencing a problem with hardware.

I appreciate it. Turns out the fix was as strange as the solution. I just downloaded the installer and ran it. The installer acted like the program wasn't on the machine (didn't ask to uninstall, repair, etc.). After running the installer like it was a fresh install the launcher started running fine.","replies":[]}]}]}
