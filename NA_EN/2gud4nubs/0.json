Zix also doesn't have a free 15% damage reduc that can't be ignored.\n\nWell, it takes about 3 items for Kassadin to achive the amount of damage put out by other more useful assassins with 1 item; yes a 6 item Kassadin can put out enough damage to burst an adc with no defensive items, but he has low across the board base damage on all his abilities which is compounded by his need to build mana items [i.e. not damage] early.\n\nOther assassins have better bases and more sources of damage in general, on shorter cooldowns, with much fewer constraints on the use of their abilities (no stack requirements for casts, no quadratically scaling mana costs). Plus they can actually reach their targets in one jump.","replies":[{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2015-04-18T06:58:32.170+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Considering none of them have insta-damage abilities, all of them having at least travel time if they're not skill shots... Yeeaah. Kassadin has a lot going for him. You can also choose to get the mana items. An Archangels and Lichbane is enough for a Kassadin in all honestly and it allows him to burst incredibly well considering his W already has a 60% ratio. With a Lichbane, that's a 1.1x ratio. By itself. His Q is a .7 and his E is a .7. Comparatively, he does a lot of damage, has nice ratios... Honestly, Kassadin is in a perfectly fine place where he can do well against many AP mids. With the return of the tanks who have poor early games and Kass being immobile pre-6, he's capable of getting to his prime a lot easier. \n\nZix on the other hand requires his Q to be evolved, his opponent to be 500 units away from another unit, AND he needs at least 2 completed items to burst a carry 100-0. When you compare that to Kassadin or really any assassin, it's silly. Zix's isolation range needs to be reduced and a little more damage placed back into his W. He's easily mana gated without blue since the jungle items don't provide mana and his clear speeds are fine, so it doesn't warrant a purple smite. I mean, he's got issues in the new jungle that should be accounted for without making his laning self, which can be top or mid, be too strong.","replies":[{"poster":"JedenVojak","date":"2015-04-20T23:53:43.932+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Many assassins have point and click damage or very reliable damage abilities, and even the ones that don't have much higher bursts than Kassadin does much earlier in the game. Kassadin's base damages across all of his abilities are all extremely low (I'm talking sub support level), his offensive range is very short and he's inhibited by relatively long cooldowns on his offensive abilities. He has respectable scalings, sure, but any other ap mage assassin can also build lich bane, while having better damage. He also doesn't counter mages since he has no way to burst them down early to mid game, and can't really stop them from doing anything or escaping. The nerf to his riftwalk range basically ruined his only real strength, which was a high range of selective positioning.\n\nAs it stands right now Leblanc basically does everything Kassadin does, but with more damage and she can farm at range.\n\n>You can also choose to get the mana items.\n\nThis is not a point in Kassadin's favor at all; he doesn't choose to buy into mana, he is forced to do so to fuel his exorbitant mana costs, where other assassins can get away with buying damage right off the bat.\n\nHowever, in terms of Kha'zix, it's possible I'm not aware enough of his problems to say he's not underpowered. I know the jungle changes were really rough on jungle assassins, so he may just not have enough burst to get through the camps early game.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Selk3t","date":"2015-04-18T00:45:59.542+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=2gud4nubs,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=XQYXvRat,comment-id=,timestamp=2015-04-17T03:21:58.076+0000)\n>\n> Kha&#039;Zix is by far the worst and most useless assassin champ\n\n\nAkali........","replies":[{"poster":"GloriousKaiser","date":"2015-04-18T02:03:14.596+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:121}} Thresh can you move like two steps away from Jinx?\n{{champion:412}} No, Kha.\nhttp://img3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20130929123337/leagueoflegends/images/d/d5/Death_Sentence.png\n{{item:3070}} {{champion:121}} {{item:3070}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"2gud4nubs","date":"2015-04-19T21:27:16.381+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kha'Zix is NOT in a good position.
