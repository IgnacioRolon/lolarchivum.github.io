My in-game client will not load/connect to the internet.","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi,\r\n\r\nEvery game I currently am trying to play will not load in past the picks and bans. The template where the champions load pops up and then it says that it is not responding, so will not load. Then when I try to reconnect, it says I am not connected to the internet! This does not make sense, as I am still able to use the internet at the same time as it saying I apparently have no internet connection. This has led to me gaining a 5x20 minute queue increase. Not that this makes any difference, as I can't connect to any games anyway!\r\n\r\nAny help on this situation at all would be greatly appreciated, because I can no longer play my favourite game!{{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-20T18:47:50.992+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"It sounds like your network is having a hard time staying connected specifically to our servers.  I suggest using the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to troubleshoot this towards a resolution.  In addition, if you have any apps running like play.tv I recommend removing them as they've been known to cause issues during champ select.  Let me know if you have any questions.","replies":[{"poster":"Jackh123i","date":"2016-10-24T16:46:27.042+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi,\n\nI'm still struggling over here and I am also in contact with riot support. Tried playing again today and the same problem arose. However, about 10 minutes into the game I was able to join and PLAY in the game. This is confusing because if it was a connection issue surely it would consistent throughout the whole period of the game?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Abuse Duo","date":"2016-10-21T03:03:15.873+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This happens to me whenever the champions in game suddenly disappears all of a sudden and I have to reconnect and it won't let me reconnect and relates to the internet issue, this has happened to me ever since the update to the latest patch.","replies":[]}]}
