lane against a zac and a vlad(it was me vs vlad) and every time im about to kill Vlad this poppy ult her away, tells me i wont get ganks if i push so i don&#039;t which results in me being 4 man dove and she refuses to help me and flames me which kinda makes me pop.\r\nthe second game i dont really remember it was a few days ago? \r\nthird game pyke started trolling, like i promise he was actually trolling he came mid and sad hes not gonna let me farm and stuff so i got annoyed which i mean makes sense since hes literally trolling my lane, i get that flaming is horrible adn honestly i dont even flame often its been months since my chat restrictions ect\r\ni was on my last checkpoint before lvl 1 honor because i was behaving so well\r\ni go no warning about my flaming whatsoever and suddenly today i got perma banned  out of the blue with no build up to it. ive had this account for ages and is the account i started league with and while ive had chat restrictions have never been banned. im not saying the banning system is bad i think they do a good job on people but i mean do i really deserve a permanent ban for losing it 3 games. i can understand chat restrictions and temporary bans but i dont think that this permaban is merited im normally very good as shown by me nearly being lvl 1 honor. is there a way i can ask for a reduced sentence or something of the sort. i worked so hard to build up my honor level and be good","replies":[{"poster":"breakordoom444","date":"2018-08-05T19:15:56.000+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"ah..... where do i start\n\nlets go:\n\nGame

Even if they intended to be fully reformed, some people just can't keep themselves from becoming a keyboard warrior, even when given a second chance.\n\n---\n\nBut there is a slim hope. Currently there is an experiment ongoing to see if people can reform. Riot is monitoring a group of previously permabanned players to see if they're behaviour has changed significantly enough for it to be safe to leave them unattended.\n\nIf the experiment has a good successrate chances are that it'll be fully implemented, and it might also come to EUW (Currently, it's NA only). It'll take a while, but it's really the only way to get unbanned.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Aneirin","date":"2018-08-05T21:53:15.984+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> prove its not a reoccurring thing\n\nYou've told people to kill themselves in multiple games.

You said that you got \"perma banned with no warning\", in the next sentence you say that you HAVE been chat restricted... {{sticker:sg-lux-2}} \n\n\n\nSecond, no, riot employees arent here to babysit you and tell you to stop flaming every game, you are not a toddler you should know right from wrong. If you flame its your problem for making a poor decision, thus you ended up with a ban.\n\nAlso, have you ever heard of \"learning from your mistakes\"??? If you overextend and get ganked by the enemy jungler, it is YOUR fault, not your junglers. YOU overextended, YOU didnt ward, and YOU died, not your teammates. It is not your junglers job to babysit you every 3 seconds to make sure you havent gotten ganked. If warding is a weakspot, practice placing more wards instead of flaming your team for not \"helping you\". \n\nIt helps NOBODY when you're screaming in all caps and mispelling things. if you need help with toxicity /mute all and dont type. Its your fault for sticking your nose out, not any one elses. If you got banned, man up to it and improve being a better non toxic player, dont go screaming into the boards with your 7 year old temper tantrum.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2018-08-05T21:37:45.724+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's an escalated punishment cos you told someone to

worst and provable offense which is afk, dc, leaving as a simple timeout.\n\nYou can't mute them and they leave your team at a disadvantage but to keep those (to spend money) who can't be responsible and stay in the games they committed to for w/e reason they coddle you by putting you in the corner for up to 20 minutes instead of banning your useless self.","replies":[]}]}
