It matters because I worked to get Gold 5 in Ranked Flex Twisted Treeline and I'm wondering if I get season end rewards for it. I've searched multiple websites and found nothing. If anyone could help me out that'd be greatly appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-04-01T18:43:39.818+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not sure!  We haven't announced any rewards for the current season.  I'm not sure when, but traditionally we've done it towards the end of a season.  Bookmark our [News](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/) page and hang tight until then!","replies":[]},{"poster":"IAmLuckyI","date":"2017-04-01T14:36:22.712+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There were Rewards the last Season too, so yes there is i guess.","replies":[]}]}
