Not completely random, just replace q&#039;s with other q&#039;s and ults with ults etc. Basically pick a champion and the only thing for sure you know you are getting is their base values. I know this can make completely unbalanced teams, but I think it could be fun and challenging to have your teammates trying to coordinate strategies with what abilities everyone has. Also I&#039;m pretty sure that this is not an original idea, but I haven&#039;t seen it here and I would like to post it anyways.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-10-30T03:49:55.527+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This would never work for a large number of reasons, primarily animations and how abilities are programmed.","replies":[]}]}
