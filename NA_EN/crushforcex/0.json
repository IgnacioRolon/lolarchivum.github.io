The thing is, besides 2 comments, one of which was a \"Hardpush u idiot\" which is hardly reportable, and another of which was said while everyone had already left the lobby, I literally said nothing negative to my teammates, just defended myself. None of the swear words were directed at them either. Should I have said those 2 comments? Probably not, but considering that people have been defended for saying a lot worse than \"hardpush u idiot\" and nobody else got flamed by me, this is practically a ban for picking off meta.\r\n\r\n(Any words I add will be in [square brackets] between the text for context.
