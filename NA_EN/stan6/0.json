Today I wanted to log in my account in Oceania to see if I can transfer to the American server, but I found that my account was banned by using third-party software. I never use any third-party software for the game, and I don't have any those kind of software in my laptop. \r\n\r\nI also checked my match history, there was a four games history on 8/16/2019. However, I never log in this account since June. It seems someone hacked my account and play games with the third party software. I also checked the history that the guy played four games with another player called \"Behind You\", that definitely wasn't me. \r\n\r\nI don't know what to do but I really want my this account back. I got friends and spent money on it, all memories. \r\n\r\nCan someone help me to deal with this issue? Thanks a lot! {{sticker:cass-cry}}","replies":[{"poster":"Drag0nHatcher","date":"2019-11-18T02:41:22.442+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Something similar happened to me today, just a an hour or two ago, tho i actively play and have not been inactive(was actually playing earlier today!!). This is my OP.gg: https://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=Drag0nHatcher  . As you can see my latest two matches are out of the ordinary for my KDA and for the champs i have played recently(I have only played Irelia 4 times this season and that is not including the game that it says i played and got insanely high kills in), hope we both get our issues resolved and i would recommend making a ticket just like i did.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pyrosan","date":"2019-11-18T02:36:29.905+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"message the support team and you can recover your account and get unbanned if you can prove you're the original owner","replies":[{"poster":"stan6","date":"2019-11-18T17:07:46.521+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks, bro!
