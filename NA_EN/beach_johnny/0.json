Which sucks. But the thing is that I'm only in low priority queue because of my PC. A year ago my PC was running windows vista, and it sucked, so when windows 10 came out, I was pretty happy. Until I got it. It ran fine at first, and so I downloaded League and logged into my account. I played a few matches and then right in the middle of one... Boom. PC crashed. This happened so many times now, that I'm genuinely afraid to play a match, because my PC might crash and then I'll be in low priority queue for 20 minutes before each game for five games. I've tried fixing the problem, but it didn't work. I don't know what to do anymore. My PC is dumb, low prior is dumb. Please help.","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-05-23T23:09:55.511+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Depending on what the issue is, we may be able to help out.  However, it is possible that the computer hardware itself is the root cause to this issue.\n\nTo dig a bit deeper though, when you say that your PC crashes, what happens exactly?  Does the entire computer shut-down?  Do you get a Blue Screen?  Does a particular error message appear?  \n\nReply back and let me know!","replies":[{"poster":"Beach Johnny","date":"2016-05-23T23:41:39.375+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I get a bsod, the error message is \"kernal auto boost with raised irql\"","replies":[{"poster":"Voidac","date":"2016-05-24T01:00:16.774+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's Riot's nice way of telling you \"you're PC has lived out its lifetime, get a new one\".","replies":[]},{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-05-25T00:18:36.401+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A BSOD definitely means something is wrong from the hardware end of things regarding your computer.  Given that your computer isn't that old, you may want to take your computer to a local computer repair store to get a better idea what the BSOD is being caused by since this is prompted by the OS/computer itself, and not by League.\n\nI hope this helps!","replies":[]}]}]}]}
