I think you need to elaborate before you can even begin to call me &quot;extremely ignorant&quot; or a &quot;borderline racist&quot;.\n\nI can't believe I actually have to write this. Alright.\n\nFirst, we need to establish a scale. The best way is to imagine League of Legends as a video game club building with lights and a table where you can view all the stuff you have access to(BUT DON'T OWN). You get in a room with four other people. You start yelling at one of the other teammates. It could be because they are yelling at you, it could be because they are intentionally feeding, it could be because they are playing poorly, it could be because you are having a bad day. \n\nEither way, the yelling does nothing  to help the situation, so Riot gives a warning to  everyone doing wrong and if you get enough warnings, you are banned from the club. That should  give you a sense of scale. It's like being kicked out of a restaurant or from a miniature golf course. The rules might be harsh, but it's to keep things from escalating.\n\nNow, it is tough to see an intentional feeder on your team and feel helpless. But flaming doesn't DO anything, and it is most likely to make the situation worse. Is it hard to hunch your shoulders and try and  go on? Yes. But it is the better option. Because flaming does nothing.\n\n\nSo what you are doing is comparing the plight of someone who broke the rules and got thrown out of the theater to a jewish person in Germany during WW2.\n\nWhen on Nov. 9 1938, thousands of businesses and synagogues were burned across all of Germany just because they were Jewish. 8000+ buildings in a single night. \nhttps://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/00/81/cf/0081cffdbc12bbba256c398676a8b913.jpg\n\nOr how they were all forced into ghettos and wore brands just because they were jewish, and threatened with armed guards.\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2c/Lwow_Ghetto_%28spring_1942%29.jpg\n\nOr how they were eventually forced into concentration camps and starved to the point that many actually died immediately upon rescue because they drank and ate so much their bodies couldn't handle it.\nhttps://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/64/b5/9c/64b59c7e7a363b25da5f8edaf421afe6.jpg\n\nOr how they were executed systematically like animals.\n\nhttps://furtherglory.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/dachaumorgue1945.jp-g (Warning, disturbing and graphic photo of the room next to a gas chamber)\n\n\nThe difference of scale is so off the charts, you are actually being offensive, because by comparing the two, you are lessening the plight of the people in these photos. That's what Godwin's Law actually is about.","replies":[{"poster":"Blood Lyrics","date":"2017-06-19T02:40:59.636+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=EvilDustMan,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=EXG0oVcE,comment-id=00010000000000000000000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2017-06-18T20:27:39.714+0000)\n>\n> The difference of scale is so off the charts, you are actually being offensive, because by comparing the two, you are lessening the plight of the people in these photos. That&#x27;s what Godwin&#x27;s Law actually is about.\n\nSee, the thing is, where do you get off on being the definer of this scale? No man, men, nor group of men (note: I use man here as mankind, not male human beings) has the right (nevermind capability) of properly ranking events on a scale of morality. Morality is affected per individual and it is never able to reach a culminating consensus for all human beings.\n\nMoreover, I compared the similar situation of blindly following rules in both scenarios - where people of similar origin oppressed one another because they were told that it was the right thing to do - _not_ the end results of the events. There are few instances in history that mimic such a scenario and Hitler's oppression of the Jews is definitely the most prominent (thereby the most capable of facilitating discussion since people need to understand the reference in order to discuss it).\n\nYes, comparing a genocide to wrongful banning is probably offensive. But again, that is not the comparison I have been making. Comparing the treatment of two peoples by their peers under the encouragement of those in positions of power is not offensive.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Reket DeAlk","date":"2017-06-18T17:08:46.743+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"The one giant flaw with your comparison: There's no consequences for **following** the rules.","replies":[{"poster":"Blood Lyrics","date":"2017-06-18T17:57:06.787+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Reket DeAlk,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=EXG0oVcE,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2017-06-18T17:08:46.743+0000)\n>\n> The one giant flaw with your comparison: There&#x27;s no consequences for **following** the rules.\n\nThe consequence of following some rules, such as how we punish players for retaliating to toxicity with toxicity, is that we are also harming a victim.
