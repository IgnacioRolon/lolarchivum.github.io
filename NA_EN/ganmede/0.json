However, when I placed that name into the name checker, it said that name is not appropriate. I am taking a wild guess and thought that it detected gay in the name; _**Ga**_n_**y**_mede. I was wondering If I could change my name. Riot, please fix.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-11-25T17:52:43.591+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Heya, hit us up in a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) so we can check the availability and set it up for you manually.
