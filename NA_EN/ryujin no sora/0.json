Boom fixed.\n\npoint blank it wouldnt make a difference for melee champions. its still hard to miss a skillshot at close range if it isnt incredibly delayed.\n\nid rather change her e to a hard, short duration slow, unless the ability connects the enemy champion with a wall in which case it would become a knockback and stun him into the wall like it currently does, similar to how {{champion:432}} q works. in return they can buff the damage upon connecting the shot with a wall.\n\nheck, id even make it possible to knock champions into each other, as long as it has very little effect when you dont connect the shot.\n\nthis way it would change from a free \"oh shit i fucked up\" button to a more skill and position based ability that the opponent can actually play around.\n\nher w should deal physical damage which is turned into true damage on a long cooldown upon activation (means the cooldown timer starts upon pressing the button). something like between 15 to 20 seconds and last 3 seconds, while procs extend the duration for another 3 seconds.\n\nmake her lose the bonus entirely while the ability is on cooldown, similar to how {{champion:11}} e works.\n\nthat way you could outplay her at least by baiting it out as an ability and creating a cooldown window to fight her. if she plays correctly, choses the right time to activate it and stays in the fight, the duration for the true damage procs just keeps getting extended. if she wastes it, shes open to get engaged on even by a single opponent. the more procs she can get off, the shorter would the window be to reactivate the w.\n\nthey could up some of her base stats and/or q damage to compensate.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"D357R0Y3R","date":"2019-07-06T20:09:07.293+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":4,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Ryujin No

Instead of trying to disengage or otherwise avoid Vayne's autos intermittently to negate her steroid, every hit now has that effect. Wow.\n\nSome abilities, like Xerath's Q, work okay as spells that have to be charged up. Increasing the charge time simply enhances the spell, and the opponent gets a bit of warning that it's incoming, which is fair because these are generally long-range, high-impact spells that don't really behave any differently whether they hit immediately or after a short delay. If Vayne's E had an obvious charge time, though, the spell would be utterly useless, as targets would get an extensive warning that they should move away from any walls, or even reposition so that they get knocked in a beneficial direction. At that point, they might even _want_ to be hit. Abilities that charge up are meant to allow and encourage opponents to avoid them, not to negate the ability entirely.\n\nThis R change would make it utterly useless. Why are you comparing Vayne's R invisibility to Twitch's Q camo? The former lasts one second, and is really only useful if Vayne is within range of her opponent. Twitch's camo lasts 10-14 seconds, allowing him to sneak up on opponents (it's an \"Ambush,\" after all), avoid being spotted by wards, etc. It ends when he attacks, because there'd be no purpose to being camouflaged intermittently in the middle of combat. If Vayne's invisibility became a camo effect, it would basically be cosmetic.\n\nTerrible, terrible changes that reveal a fundamental misunderstanding of game design and mechanics.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Ryujin No Sora,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=pOe6ZHnh,comment-id=,timestamp=2019-07-06T19:26:55.860+0000)\n>\n> Just get rid of these 2 item powerspike late game gods from existance.
