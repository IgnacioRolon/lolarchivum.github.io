I pulled up an internet browser and it's connection was fine, so I exited League to try to reconnect back in. Immediately as I closed the league game to took me back to the home client like I had never been playing. I closed and reopened the client and still no reconnect screen. \r\n\r\nHas anyone else had this problem? Am I going to get counted for a loss?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-25T03:01:10.319+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahhhh it sounds like you encountered a rare issue where the game actually crashes on the server itself. It's pretty rare, but when it happens you won't ever be able to reconnect and it'll look like the match just never happened at all. No worries, you won't get any penalties for that match either.","replies":[]}]}
