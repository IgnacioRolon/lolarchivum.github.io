No, not really.\nThat means it's up to themselves to learn how to become a \"proper\" player (a term that is up for individual judgement - but we all like seeing ourselves as better than we might really be. Which is unfortunate, but it is human nature), and likewise their own responsibility if they fail to do so.\n\nThat said, it is the responsibility of all of us to ensure everyone got a good time. And while I don't think ranked is a place to \"have a good time\", that's still no excuse to treat someone poorly.\n\"Harrassment\" is also something up for individual judgement, as we all take and give statements in any sort of meaning in different ways, and we all also take these statements in different ways, whether it be with a shrug, understand the seriousness in it, start to cry or take a lesson in it on what not to do in the future.\n\nThere is so much subjectiveness in all this, that it is IMPOSSIBLE to find one solution that suits all.\nEven the proverb \"treat other like you yourself would like to be treated\" is a no-go due to all the different societies around the world.\nI see the phrase \"kurwa\", I report that person for the sake of it (though depending on my perception of the context), despite it might it a perfectly acceptable swear-word in that person's local community.\n_That said, if that person are unable to understand that word is not encessarily acceptable everywhere else, he/she does not have a place here._\n\nSo, to summarize: we're stuck with this issue. Always has been, and likely always will be.\n\nYour turn; I'd like your views on this before we stop this line of discussion in this thread.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"AmazoX","date":"2017-02-06T04:48:22.050+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I don't see a reason it shouldn't.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"PaladinNO","date":"2017-02-06T06:06:55.463+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":">956,000 IP\n\n...Come again?
