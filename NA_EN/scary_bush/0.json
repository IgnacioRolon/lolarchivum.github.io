I came back a month later to get a few games feeling refreshed and positive. I remember purposefully being overwhelmingly positive! (why doesn't Riot Games look into my chat from previous games?).\r\n\r\nSome context. Game starts off well, I have good chemistry with my support, our Wukong is being cocky because he is fed and yelling at my other teammates. I tell him \"Shhhh,\" and remind him to be a team player, not to shit talk others. He's triggered ofc because he's fed. Darius is feeding and quits, which really get's Wukong mad. Then Wukong and Darius are fighting and I try to intervene). Wukong get's mad at me and convinces other players I'm toxic (HUH??). And yeah, a bunch of debauchery that I can't recall.\r\n\r\nAnyway I'm assuming i got restricted because members on my team after Game 1 reported me for calling them out for being toxic players. If Riot member is reading this, I implore you to read the rest of the chat to get the full context!\r\n\r\nThere is a game 2 chat, where I was bit frustrated and acted toxic, but i left it out because it was after a series of long losses about a month before (I own up to that, but honestly they weren't even bad.

You weren't restricted for being a positive player, you were restricted for the one negative game you had.\n\nYou could play 1000 games and only be toxic in one of them, and you're still going to get punished. Riot doesn't take in account your previous games before your toxic games, or the games after your toxic game. The IFS system doesn't take that in account either. The point is you were toxic for one game and you even admitted it, so you got punished for it.\n\nI have over 1,500 hours in this game and got chat restricted for ONE SINGLE GAME I was toxic in due to me having a bad streak and continuing to play rather than stopping for the night, therefore I got my first punishment. Even though all my games before I was the one getting all the \"tilt proof\" honors, the one who would keep the peace, etc. It doesn't matter. I was toxic, I got punished.\n\nIt's good that you are being positive now, but that doesn't erase or outweigh the negative game(s) you've had in the past.\n\nYou can still get back to honor level 2 if that's what you're worried about so long as you continue to be positive. Try not to say anything negative, really. At all. Only use the chat for neutral/positive behavior, or to make game calls. That way you know you can't be punished for chat-related behavior.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Scary Bush","date":"2019-06-19T05:26:46.102+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i don't remember using any slurs!

This game, despite my early efforts to encourage a feeding Darius, Wukong managed to get the best of him and tilt him to the point where he started doing some questionable things (like sell all his items, and build AP). \n\nThat's where this comment comes in \"put half as much energy shit talking into playing.\" Could it have been phrased better? Sure, sure, but really i feel like I was expressing a stern disappointment to Wukong's flaming of another teammate, which honestly was reductive. \n\nSo i really want to ask why nobody really has addressed this portion of the chat log:\n\nScary Bush: nice job annie!\n\nScary Bush: shhh\n\nScary Bush: just play stop fighting\n\nScary Bush: good job nami\n\nScary Bush: shhhhh\n\nScary Bush: put half as much energy shit talking into playing\n\nScary Bush: darius pls don't troll\n\nScary Bush: ur not that far behind\n\nScary Bush: u can do this\n\nScary Bush: don't let them tilt u\n\nScary Bush: darius we can do this dw\n\nScary Bush: ur only 1/4 it's not that bad\n\nScary Bush: i know man i see them\n\nScary Bush: dont' troll it doesnt' do anything for u or us\n\nScary Bush: u can be a better man\n\nScary Bush: im trying to be nice to him :/ Scary Bush: my jg is toxic lol\n\nHonestly I was really trying my best to encourage Darius, but Wukong kept flaming him.

I really think that was hypocritical of Wukong though, because in my eyes he served as a catalyst to Darius' eventual loss of effort. Wukong constantly flamed Darius and lost sight of playing properly imo.\n\nSo when the enemy team asked what was going on, i responded in an honest fashion: \"darius is having a tantrum because he lost and wukong is flaming\"\nI told them that I don't think they should report, I believe asking an enemy team to report his in and of itself toxic and reductive to the game. \n\nSo yeah, I want to have an open discussion if you guys want to, but If you really can't see why I believe this was overall a more positive game than a negative one, that says more about you (to me) than it does about me.\n\nMuch Love,\nScary Bush","replies":[]},{"poster":"Soul Dealer","date":"2019-06-18T23:59:56.179+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":10,"body":"Haven’t really seen anything worth punishment so imma say this was undeserved","replies":[{"poster":"AeroWaffle","date":"2019-06-19T00:02:32.804+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Amazing that you were somehow able to know what was on the game 2 chat log without the OP ever giving them.","replies":[{"poster":"Scary Bush","date":"2019-06-19T06:28:38.083+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey man, thanks for the input.

I get that the ban accounts for previous events of toxicity, but I really do believe this was a bit uncalled for given my situation. I know it's hard to judge on such a micro scale, but i'd just like to share my point of view.\n\nI wish Riot would post these games! Because i won both and it felt so refreshing to see how a positive attitude could reflect on a win.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Scary Bush","date":"2019-06-19T06:27:08.269+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for understanding man. I feel like a lot of people are out to try their hardest to prove me wrong. \n\nHey i get it, it's empowering to show that someone is actually negative when they claim they were positive. But honestly their are so many threads out there that are ridiculous. I feel there is an honest argument to be had here!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"PlsTouchMeGently","date":"2019-06-19T01:09:19.312+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You were on thin ice from your other game. Your propensity to get punished does not diminish when you take a break, it carries over. It does’t matter if that 2nd game was yesterday or a year ago, it’s still one of the most recent games you played. And you were toxic in it. Apparently so toxic that you wont even post the chat logs here. Chat restriction deserved.","replies":[{"poster":"Scary Bush","date":"2019-06-19T06:25:11.585+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually it wasn't the most recent game I played!
