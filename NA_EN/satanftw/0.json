For example, in Smite you can pay a set amount and you receive all god and all gods to ever come out. Does LoL have something similar?","replies":[{"poster":"Decrit","date":"2016-09-02T16:45:55.597+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, so far, but it would be intresting to have.\n\nOnly one thing: don' t buy packs containing champions that value 450 IP. The price in RP does not grow equally to the price on IP, and while 450 IP champions cost a lot less than 6300 they cost only like less than half RP.\n\nUnless you really are in a hurry of course.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-02T16:22:37.313+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There currently isn't a buy all champions bundle, but there are some select bundles that will provide essentials.  I would recommend the Champions Bundle, Digitial Collector's, or Starter Bundle.  These can be found in the Store Tab under the bundles section.  In addition to those, sometimes there will be special short term bundles too and usually posted on the [Sales ](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/store/sales)page.  I hope that helps!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ta1eck","date":"2016-09-02T12:21:37.161+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"no, they have small bundles containing 4-8 champions sometimes with skins","replies":[]}]}
