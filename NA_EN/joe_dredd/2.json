Jarvan is extremely easy to kill compared to Lee Sin. Jarvan doesn't have sustain freely like Lee Sin. Now let's put in Damage Ratio's.\n\nLee Sin!\nQ: Level 1: 100 + 180% bonus AD + 8% of missing Health.

Not even the random 80% AP ratio Jarvan has can help him against a Lee Sin of equal skill level.\n\n**However. Despite the obvious superiority in SOLO FIGHTING that Lee Sin has, Jarvan is better at team fighting because of his kit. Lee Sin's kit can help his team, but not to the level Jarvan can do.

This isn't accounting for the second spell he can use to gapclose or juke with his shield.\n\nThey both have a shield. Difference is, Lee Sin's also gives him bonus lifesteal and spellvamp while allowing him to wardhop. J4's shield might be a bit stronger, and have a slow attached, but it also can't be applied to allies. \n\nJ4's E gives him a little burst of damage and some extra attack speed for himself an allies. It's also pretty much necessary to set up for his main utility. Lee Sin's E is practically a magic damage nuke if he's building flat AD, and is a much more powerful slow than Jarvan's shield provides.\n\nThe ults don't really compare.

The reason Jarvan has a higher winrate is because he can better lock someone down, if only for a few extra moments, and can function as a tank much more efficiently in the late game than Lee Sin, who loses purpose once he can no longer single out targets as his kit isn't too hot when it comes to diving into full teams unless he's significantly fed, and then he's not playing as a tank he's just blowing people up from pure damage.\n\nJ4 = team tactics\n\nLee Sin = solo queue KDA","replies":[]},{"poster":"warpenguin555","date":"2015-01-12T17:59:02.872+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Neither one is, Lee Sin has a trash late game, and J4 is just annoying\n\ni will agree his ults damage is kinda overkill though","replies":[{"poster":"junglerboy16","date":"2015-01-12T18:26:52.017+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:59}} \"Are you calling me fat?\"\n—Riot Pwyff, the best Patch note writer ever.","replies":[{"poster":"warpenguin555","date":"2015-01-12T18:37:53.915+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=junglerboy16,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=cM30yfYL,comment-id=00030000,timestamp=2015-01-12T18:26:52.017+0000)\n>\n> {{champion:59}} \"Are you calling me fat?\"\n> —Riot Pwyff, the best Patch note writer ever.\n\nlol","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"ValyrianBlade","date":"2015-01-12T18:07:58.540+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Win rates mean nothing really.\n\nIt's not that only J4 mains play J4 or that Lee Sin non-mains play Lee Sin - the stats there are probably similar.

Having a tanky jungler allows the top laner to choose a ranged champion or a damage champion as the team already has a tank, and clearly a tanky top laner is going to lose lane more often than not to a ranged champion.

His knock up is easy to dodge since he needs you between him and his standard,  any movement (dash/leap/flash/what-have-you) can escape his ultimate,  his slow is in melee range and thus he's kite-able by anyone with a kiting mechanism (as long as they can dash back whenever j4 dashes forward). He's strong in league because his gap closer + flash + ultimate leap can combine to close a large distance and lock down many fleeing enemies rather than just one (many of which blow their escapes trying to create that gap,  J4 is a lot easier to play against when you save an escape for his ultimate or at least keep your team separated enough).","replies":[{"poster":"Gorsz","date":"2015-01-12T23:15:00.479+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Once again, j4 has always been good in every single \"meta\" you can define in this game.\n\nThe ONLY time, and I repeat the ONLY time he wasnt played was when people were psychologically tricked by Riots slap-on-wrist nerfs.\n\nJ4 is OP because he invalidates all champions who do not have mobility, and his kit has no weakness, nor flaws.

When I first played against him he killed me every time as I tried to use my net to get out of his range,  but as soon as I saved my net to escape his ultimate I wrecked him repeatedly. \n\nSecondly,  all champs can take flash (and most do). If against J4 there is a summoner there to explicitly address that problem,  so I find it hard to say anyone is invalidated.  Instead,  I'd argue that champs with movement abilities take away from J4s strengths and are probably why he's able to be as strong as he is.","replies":[{"poster":"Gorsz","date":"2015-01-13T13:45:23.430+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Flash has a 5 minute cooldown.

How many of those ever see play (even when the enemy top and jungler have already been picked and are not J4, the immobile apcs are never picked because of the state of mid Lane right now,  and for adcs the only one I can think of is jinx,  who can set her chompers in the arena for an easy stun, sivir and MF are gaining popularity though I suppose...).","replies":[{"poster":"Gorsz","date":"2015-01-13T14:52:44.338+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The reason immobile mids are not being picked is because of champions like j4.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
