Whenever someone got near her, morg would ult and kalista would ult morg and not throw her. \r\nMorg tether would keep going so that even if you could keep up with her you'd be stunned. Including black shield made it absolute cancer.","replies":[{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2015-02-22T02:24:05.987+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Abilities that aren't channeled will continue to go because they're not actually being casted anymore. Her ulti would be the same as Morg pressing a Zhonya's where the ability keeps going. lol. And Morg's tether only stuns if you STAY IN RANGE, not if you EXIT range. You don't have to 'keep up' with her. If Kalista pulls her Morgana and you walk away from Kalista, you exit Morg's tether range.","replies":[{"poster":"Joe Dredd","date":"2015-02-22T03:06:01.260+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Then why wouldn't her ult say her friendly champion becomes invulnerable then?\nWhy does it specifically say pacify?","replies":[{"poster":"Ariaflux","date":"2015-02-22T09:32:19.092+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not sure where you read \"pacify\" but it's slightly different from just invulnerability.\n\nhttp://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Untargetable","replies":[{"poster":"Joe Dredd","date":"2015-02-22T19:42:26.985+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"In game it says\n: Draw Kalista's Oathsworn to her.

The Tether acts on it's own and is no longer being controlled by Morgana. Abilities that aren't stoppable by displacements or other forms of CC's aren't controlled by the player after the button is pressed. Would be the same as a Lux tossing her Q and as it's flying, Lux gets pulled in. The spell doesn't just stop flying because she's pacified since it's already been casted. It'll keep going on it's own because it's no longer controlled by the player.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
