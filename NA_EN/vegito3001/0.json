It doesn't make any sense at all.  You have to wait 20 minutes to play one game for five games.  There is no sense in it.  What is it supposed to do?  Is it supposed to make you realize the mistakes that you have done?  \r\n \r\nI believe Riot should make Low priority queue the way it is implemented in Dota 2.  That is, only one game mode is available.  Dota 2 has implemented a very good system to punish people who may have connection problems or DC if they need to do something.  Dota 2 is more developed community wise and Valve has done a great job to account for such a thing like this.  Riot should follow the way Valve has understood their players of Dota and change low priority queue.  \r\n\r\nThank you all for reading and comment below.","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-05-26T23:18:09.105+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Keep in mind that Lower Priority Queue (as opposed to a 'prisoner island' type feature) is meant to not only let players know that leaving games is not ok, but give them time to resolve any technical issues if they are not leaving games on purpose.  If you have an inherently unstable connection, rather than hopping into game immediately once again, you have 20 minutes in an attempt to fix these issues, or wait for them to be resolved by the ISP.  At the end of the day, we want to help players, rather than just have them face punishment for the sake of punishment.\n\nI hope this makes sense!  Let me know if you have any other questions!","replies":[]}]}
