I created a support ticket about 2.5 weeks ago regarding the issue and how to recover my account, but I never received a confirmation email nor a reply. I just put another ticket in this morning thinking that maybe something went wrong when I submitted the first ticket, but again I did not receive a confirmation email.\r\n\r\nI've never had to put in a support ticket before, so I was wondering if it's normal to not receive a confirmation email? I would think that I would receive a support # at the very least. Any help or suggested next steps would is greatly appreciated!\r\n\r\nThanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Chermorg","date":"2017-11-02T14:56:08.022+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The confirmation email would probably go to the email on file - if your email was changed when you were hacked, it would go to that email.\n\nThe best thing to do is to submit the ticket while logged out. If that **still** doesn’t send you a confirmation email, then try just sending an email to support(at)riotgames.com - it’ll auto-create a ticket and you can handle it all through email.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-11-02T16:23:25.525+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Chermorg ilu!\n{{sticker:katarina-love}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-11-02T16:22:27.873+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Chermorg is correct that it's likely going to another address.  Our [account recovery form](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=72416) should allow you to input your own email address that we can reach out to directly.  You should receive a confirmation email that your ticket was submitted.  We got your back, and will be able to assist you directly with recovery, information update, and reparations!  :D  Let me know if you have any questions!","replies":[{"poster":"MichyTheUnicorn","date":"2017-11-03T13:03:50.222+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Porocles! I actually used that account recovery form both times that I sent the tickets and I also sent them both while logged off any \n LoL account, but still have no confirmation of my support tickets going through. Would it make the most sense for me to contact the support email that Chermorg next? I don't want to harass that email if there is a better place to reach out. :)","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-11-03T15:21:54.850+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's strange if you haven't received an email notification.  In that form, did you input your own address?  Double check your spam filter incase it got filtered out.  Otherwise, reaching out via support@riotgames.com works took!","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"MichyTheUnicorn","date":"2017-11-02T16:44:10.547+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you Chermorg and Porocles, appreciate both of your help and the quick replies! :)","replies":[]}]}
