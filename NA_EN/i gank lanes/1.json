His kit was originally designed around a melee-DPS mentality, and it shows. As long as they continue to center him around his current front-loaded burst play style he won't ever be healthy.

With a shield that absolutely fails in comparison with Morgana and lack of tools to actually deal with mages, he is currently considered as one of the weakest champions to play.  Why call him an antimage when he doesnt have a antimage tool? \n\nAll they need to do is slightly buff his shield ratio and duration and add his silence back. Not to his Q though, but to his W.

What people dont understand tho is that the eco system of league has drastrically changed and is very very sensitive compared to lets say s1-s2.\n\nFor instance: Kassadin has usually bad match ups across the board, but he was a good pick versus Kat and lb. Kassadin silence was removed; so kat and lb's win rate spiked. (LB having actually the same dmg pattern and almost identical mobility than him, just a LOT more dmg all game long) Now, funny enough, kassadin was so bad but still won some games cause of these match ups that--when they nerfed leblanc his win rate actually dropped because the play rate of leblanc dropped hence people would go to better mid champs! The irony. \n\nMobility isnt something that you cant balance. Usually mobility means less abilities to do dmg with: a trade off, a counterplay etc...\n\nKassadin paid in all of the above. (he was the guy who paid the most for his ult than any other champ)\n\nThe issue is that perception and actual strength (speculation) is very different and Riot refused at first to change him: but the perception was so intense on him to get gutted that they finally did it.\n\nBack in season 2/3: He was all right. You know what Riot did?\n\n-Nerfed all the picks that challenged him AND that he countered himself. \n-Changed the meta around bruisers, poke and adcs. (means assassins are no longer relevant, leaving him the only alternative)\n-Removed Force of Nature.\nTHEN\n\n-athenes nerfs\n-MR items change\n\nThere you go, uve got OP champ!\n\nWanna know something that would make him alright even tho you would give him back the stuff he had before? (base dmg, scaling and silence, dmg on ult) YES I STILL THINK HE SHOULD GET SILENCE.\n\n-Raise warmog back to 1k. (tho before it could go up to 1.2k if im not mistaken (scaling item))\n-buff Athenes MR.\n-add tenacity items\n-add D.O.T Item other than liandries.\n\nBOOM bingo. \n\n\n\nKassadin was living in a world in which he had his place, and many could fight him, catch him even.

Veigar is a Mage, Galio is a Tank, Kassadin is an Assassin. Out of all of them, Kassadin is the only one who DOESN'T do additional damage for being an anti-mage.

Kassadin is just the 'I don't take damage from you because screw you.' \n\nWe need something to make Kassadin fit the Mage Killer theme again.

That's insane! A champion who got a 70% banrate won't have a bad Kit 1 season later without any changes to his kit and only few champ releases (which he funnily enough even counters!). You however said that he wasn't permabanned 'at all'. That is IMHO so absurd, that I had to make a joke about Kassamains who don't even care about any banrate below 90%. That ofcourse is a generalization and yaddda yadda blabla, but it was never meant to be an argument of itself. Why would it? IMO the way the facts are looking its pretty obvious that I managed to prove that he was more than just viable in season 4.\nAnd this would be a huge problem for your thesis which implies that his kit is outdated now - why would it be so bad just after being permabanned just one season before AFTER a huge amount of nerfs to it?\nSimple: it wouldn't. It is still as awesome as it was in S2 (except for the silence, but S4 was post silence removal so that's not the problem).\nTo sum it up: my main thesis that a viable Kassadin would be permabanned stands.\nGo ahead and rofl and lol as much as you want, but unless you manage to explain why 70% banrate is either not a sign for a champion being still problematic or explaining why Kassadin got shrekt by the item changes within ONE SEASON it doesn't look like your argumentation is worth too much.\nKind regards.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gregor Gysi","date":"2015-07-14T19:09:00.054+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"As someone who likes to play kassadin: leave him the faq alone.
