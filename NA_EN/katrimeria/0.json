I ended up getting a ward skin shard for Lantern of the Serpent which I bought back in 2013. Since I owned it I disenchanted the ward skin and now it's gone from my ward skin collection. I was unable to select it when playing a game since it wasn't there.\r\n\r\nI also don't know how to report this directly since I have lost an item I had purchased, there isn't really an option for submitting a ticket for this sort of thing.\r\n\r\nWhat do I do?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-08T22:55:42.680+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is a known visual bug going on with a few specific wards. You still own the ward, it just doesn't show up on your profile or in champ select.
