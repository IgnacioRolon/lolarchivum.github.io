Riot has been indirectly nerfing him over the past two years and I think \r\nsomeone needs to stand up for this. I will show you a list of (in)direct nerfs to Tryndamere in which Riot in most cases didnt even give\r\nan explanation for the following balance changes. \r\n\r\n-Spinning Slash mobility nerf on critical strikes. (Only nerf with explanation).\r\n-Turret Damage buffed and added a new slowing inhibitor turret, which both made it much harder to turret dive with Trynd.(Or impossible).\r\nBefore the turret changes, Tryndamere could take approx 7 turretshots without using ult at lvl 6. After the turret changes he can only take 4. \r\n-League of Tanks. Tanks in the toplane are dominant and form a way bigger threat in teamfights these days than a Tryndamere. \r\n-Lot of counters and was nerfed into oblivion in past times because people didnt know how to counter him, now they do. \r\n-Impactful Itemization changes. First of all, BotRK was nerfed: active ranged reduced, active cooldown increased from 60 to 90 seconds, active passive reduced and lifesteal reduced from 15% to 10%. Infinity Edge nerfed (which was an intended nerf for Marksmen only in which Tryndamere wasnt taken into consideration), tank items buffed like Thornmail and Randuins Omen. In the end you also have the new popular movement speed item designed for mages which makes it harder for Tryndamere to chase casters in the enemy backline. \r\n\r\nWhat do you guys think about this? Let me know what you think.","replies":[{"poster":"theragingnerd","date":"2015-05-03T18:08:43.600+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"what if u don't have a counter on ur team PENTA KILL","replies":[{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2015-05-03T19:48:46.580+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your entire team doesn't have a tank or any form of CC..? o.o","replies":[{"poster":"theragingnerd","date":"2015-05-03T21:25:33.084+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Zair Umbras,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Au02qRKW,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2015-05-03T19:48:46.580+0000)\n>\n> Your entire team doesn't have a tank or any form of CC..? o.o\n\ntryndamere can literally ignore the tank and not everyone has point and click u can miss","replies":[{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2015-05-03T23:02:52.246+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tryn can't ignore the tanks now.
