It will give a moderate XP advantage and might result in a better CS lead (but if you're taking CS from the lane, this will be more difficult to achieve). \n\nBest case scenario your laner is already ahead and nothing bad happens. Worst case scenario your laner is in an unfavorable matchup and you're keeping them behind in lane. \n\nWhy is this an issue? Lee Sin, Pantheon, and chamions like them have godly early games but tend to be less relevant in the late game because they don't have the same impact as other champions. If you're hoarding kills from your laners you're holding your team back and stalling out a game. \n\nHow many times have you seen a Lee Sin go 11/0 by 15 min and then 12/11? How many times have you seen a Lee Sin Q into a teamfight only to get CCed to death and collapsed on? Too many times to count. \n\nYou're hurting your team if you play selfishly and take everything. Sure, your KDA might look good for the first 15-20 min of the game, but once teamfighting phase rolls around and you fall off...your allies won't be able to back you up.\n\nEDIT: There is a difference between intentionally stealing a kill and securing a kill. \n\nEDIT 2: I love how everyone is assuming that Lee Sin is going to play perfectly and set up every objective and do everything right. \n\nYou know who else can set up objectives and snowball advantages? People in lanes. Grow the fuck up and stop stealing kills to inflate your KDA.

A support doesn tax the mid laner if they roam for a gank mid... It is the junglers JOB to gank and make the laners lives easier. After a kill and my laner wants to back, or they want plates, or we want to take rift/dragon. THEN I'll help myself by helping them clear the wave. \n\nHowever, laners also need to understand the jungler isn't their bitch. They can't whistle for a gank and expect them to stop blue buff and run bot lane. Also if they have prioity in lane and the junglers meet up at scuttle, its a good idea usually to rotate and help your jungler, js.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Marshbouy","date":"2019-02-09T19:32:01.151+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Who tf is clearing krugs at 20 min when dragon is up?

They are champions like yi, kha, graves, and kindred. They only take kills because they scale like monsters, but otherwise kills should always be given to the laner. Junglers don't need that gold lead. For most of them, the skill to set up a good gank is much more important than being able to 1v1 the enemy laner. \n\nThe same applies to roaming. Sure, a LeBlanc can take the kill because you know she will be busted once 4/0, but champions like liss or anivia don't need the kill. \n\nJunglers are the one scaling with level instead of item (pre-6), and to be honest some junglers don't even need any gold to be effective. For example, a {{champion:33}} with 200 armor is just as strong as him with 150 armor.","replies":[]},{"poster":"FixHealsRemoveGW","date":"2019-02-13T14:11:59.698+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The best Lees are those that come for the free kill then smite your cannon, take all cs and then leave you to be ganked 2 times by enemy jungler.
