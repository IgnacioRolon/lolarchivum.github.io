They can technically be infinitely valuable in a game but more realistically they can be around 200-300% gold efficient if you place enough wards and use the passives effectively. The gold generation passives can pay for over half of the item just by themselves. I greatly stress this next point. \n\n**Sight stones are not built in other roles in the game because the majority of their use comes from the gold gen passive along with the wards. The different passives are useless if you are the one last hitting CS.**(With the exception of ruby sight stone being kinda worthless in comparison to other SS items.)\nTechnically you can build a support item to get the warding done yourself. The barriers to this are that you waste an item slot on the incredibly low stat {{item:2049}} or waste a gold gen passive on nothing. Most people just cross their fingers and hope the support is competent enough to cover vision by them self.","replies":[{"poster":"Oglaf","date":"2016-11-26T15:10:17.215+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":7,"body":"No you.\n\nIt wasting an inventory slot is a very valid complaint.","replies":[{"poster":"Marshbouy","date":"2016-11-26T15:13:14.826+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qEqFhnj7zDU/maxresdefault.jpg","replies":[]},{"poster":"Marshbouy","date":"2016-11-26T15:24:19.437+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you could explain how they completely waste an item slot even when they provide invaluable support to a team, i'd greatly appreciate it.","replies":[{"poster":"Oglaf","date":"2016-11-26T15:34:30.392+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Marshbouy,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=EoReM8Ly,comment-id=00000001,timestamp=2016-11-26T15:24:19.437+0000)\n>\n> If you could explain how they completely waste an item slot even when they provide invaluable support to a team, i&#x27;d greatly appreciate it.\n\nBecause aside from the active, it is a really reaaaaaally terrible item?

Especially considering the _mandatory nature_ of it.\n\nWhy should Warding be the only active in the game where you have to sacrifice good stats for the active? You have things like {{item:3512}} {{item:3107}} which also offers unique utility through an active, yet it is allowed to have stats that make it worth picking up. These items are desirable _both for it's active and it's stats_.\n\nWhy is vision supposed to be so uniquely punishing? The thing is, I don't think it is. meant to be that way Riot have shown a desire to improve upon it with the Eye-line of Support/Ward hybrid items. They just seemingly forgot about the baseline Sightstones in the process. \n\nIf you wanna go fully upgrade your Support item rather than Hybridize, you're screwed.","replies":[{"poster":"Penns","date":"2016-11-26T15:50:49.835+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Probably to stop it from being built on other champs because, like I said, it is a support item.

So basically {{item:3401}} {{item:3069}} {{item:3092}}  would all be able to carry ward charges.  \n\nThe only issue is that these items already have active abilities and I am not sure if Riot would want to have  an item with 2 actives which would require 2 key bindings to a single item.  You would also need to do something similar to how jungle items are only purchasable by people bringing smite, making it more or less a jungle exclusive item with support items. Something along the lines of only people who are in the support position in champ select can purchase to prevent it being used in mid lane like the old frost queens.\n\njust a thought","replies":[]}]}
