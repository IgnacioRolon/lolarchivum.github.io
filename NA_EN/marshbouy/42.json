And they also shouldn't be outsustaining a melee carry. \n\nThe point is, they shouldn't be able to eat their cake and have it too. Too bad with crit, attack speed, range, and tons of ad, plus AD items with copious amounts of lifesteal, we have to deal with sustain gods with each auto attack being stronger than a mage spell. Ahem, show me just how many mages have 1000 damage spells. \n\nAs for mages chunking towers, it's because Rito thought it was a good idea, but also because the midlaner shouldn't be absolutely useless if he scored an ace but he's the last one alive on the team. \n\nThink about it, while ADCs are the turret killers, if they were the only ones who were capable of doing it both teams wouldn't even have to do anything other than focus fhe adc.
