Braum with sight stone gets more damage on his q and durability in general while  providding vision to secure your lane. second remember that you wouldnt have gotten the kill by your self any way the only thing in the lane supports give you automatically as farm as there is no reason for you to get all the kills and snowball but the enemy can then jump on your support and kill them and get fed that way but at least you as an adc didnt die and can now start rageing at the trash support that fed you 4 kills earlier  rather than makeing sure you both are in a solid place","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"redfeenix","date":"2016-11-29T00:31:07.235+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Oh god I disagree with your viewpoint on so many levels....","replies":[]},{"poster":"IcyPepper","date":"2016-11-29T07:56:52.744+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And that's fine.\n\nJust like not apologizing.\n\nIt's not that huge of a deal either way.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Skinny Latte","date":"2016-11-29T07:55:22.193+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if the carry couldnt get the kill themselves they arent deserving of the gold anyways","replies":[]},{"poster":"IziMytTJd7","date":"2016-11-29T01:46:06.570+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But then you get killed by ganks that you don't see coming and that you can't run away from because you have no boots and soon that bf sword doesn't seem so valuable.","replies":[{"poster":"Marshbouy","date":"2016-11-29T01:52:19.216+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Or you could buy 2 wards off the 150 assist gold that you got in the lane, have your competent ADC ward the lane, and not play like a buffoon?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Mecha MaIphite","date":"2016-11-29T00:28:56.652+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I've never really gotten why some people are against the idea of the support apologising.
