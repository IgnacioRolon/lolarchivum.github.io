He also doesnt get stacks by just attacking enemy champions\n\nI'm not saying nasus is op or veigar is weak,  just that both have pros and cons:\nVeigar is squishy, needs to build damage,  immobile,  has long cooldowns on all but q, has mainly skillshots that can be easily avoided (except r). He also has immense damage potential,  and aoe cc.\n\nNasus can build pure tank,  is immobile,  has short cooldowns,  has aoe armour/mr shred,  is kite-able, has largely point and click abilities,  and has immense damage potential. \n\nRealistically,  the only thing veigar has on nasus is range. Which is obviously really valuable.  I'm just saying complaining that veigar can stack oodles of damage while building damage when nasus does the same while building tank,  seems hypocritical to me. \n\nThere's plenty of counterplay to both of them. Dodge his q and he won't stack up.  Dodge his e and he can't land his w. Gank him early and often to snowball your ally since he's immobile.\n\nDeny nasus stacks in Lane.  Gank early and often to shut him down and snowball ally. Make plays around the map while he farms for 5v4 advantages. QSS his wither in the late game. Peel him off your carries.","replies":[]},{"poster":"junglerboy16","date":"2016-05-12T02:30:30.607+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Veigar also has to build a lot of actual damage items to do real damage late game. Nasus builds almost straight tank and stacks faster to boot.\n\nThey stack in different ways and have different pros and cons, it's not really fair to point out one's power without admitting to the other's.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"I am Pacman","date":"2016-05-12T00:41:44.607+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Looked you up quickly.  You had roughly 180 mr - 15 pen from boots and -9 from runes gives us 156 mr.  Thats about 60% dmg reduction. Veigars w does 300 base dmg with an ap ratio of 100%.  That means he would need 2250 total dmg on his w to do 900 dmg to you.  \n\n2250-300=1950\n\nVeigar must have had 1950 ap.  We'll assume max stacks on mejas.\n\nMejas - 145\nMorrelonomicon - 100\nLudens - 100\nRod - 100\nRabadons - 120\n= 565 ap\nVeigars passive - ?\n* 1.35 for rabadons passive\n*1.15 for blue buff?\n=*1.5\n\n= 1950\n/1.5= 1300\n\n1300-565=735\n\nThus veigars passive must have given him at least 735 ap.  While this is a stretch considering that game was 42 min long its not too impossible, especially in bronze.\n\nOr you could be lying about how much damage it did.  In which case it would have been even easier for him to achieve that result.\n\nEdit: completly forgot about the 7% magic pen mastery but that's irrelevant because veigar had thunderlords.  However I did forget about the 5% boost to dmg to targets below 40% hp and the boost of either 5% for killing enemies or 2.5% for being stunned based on what he took so whoops.","replies":[{"poster":"Marshbouy","date":"2016-05-12T00:44:04.943+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can assure you it did 900 damage","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Trashlord Kayden","date":"2016-05-12T00:36:52.821+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"his W does as much damage as his ult does. and building mr for him is kinda pointless bc he will melt you anyway.","replies":[]}]}
