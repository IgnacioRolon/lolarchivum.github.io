There should not be a Spirit out in the first place, because both parties should have been able to dodge it.\nThe W range is quite short, and the tentacle(s) will not swing until she actually hits the target, which is to say, the leaping animation is just excess time for the Illaoi player.\n\nAlso, she won't escape if you flanked her in the first place between your tower while she was pushed up (which she'd naturally do through nature of her Q waveclear/Ws/occasional slams from Vessel-targeting).

Silence really messes with Illaoi's fighting, because ALL OF HER DAMAGE COMES FROM ABILITIES WITH LOW CDS. If she's silenced for 2 seconds she dies because all she does is auto and her tentacles stare at you as you die horribly.","replies":[{"poster":"Astôlfo","date":"2016-10-02T22:51:21.861+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Or alternatively, any movement-locking CC, as her W is treated as a dash + empowered auto.\nIf she can't get into range to auto, then nothing will happen.","replies":[{"poster":"LordBahamutXVI","date":"2016-10-03T11:02:51.212+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"that does not stop q or e or ult, all of which she can hurt you badly with.

NO GO. leave your top laner to his fate. do not interfere. only fight this if you have a malzahar top or garen. or a soraka is coming to help.

Killable.\n\nShe is kind of like darius. If you can dodge her Q, you have a good chance at killing her.\n\nYou just have to avoid her skillshots and get out of her mosh pit. If she ults you leave. I dont understand junglers who wont gnk certain champions or lanes.
