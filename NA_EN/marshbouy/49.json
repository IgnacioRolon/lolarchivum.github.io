Your Nasus is winning your games, spam it.\nB) Complaining in game and now onto boards WON'T make you win... Simply stop telling people how to play when millions others are either or in Silver V... Play with what you GOT and I'm sure enemies have had the same thing you've experienced so you'd get a free win, great. TEAMWORK beats flaming/raging at someone who then under performs.\n3) Winning ISN'T about one lane dominating, hence teamwork. If you're doing well either help the team snowball OR go split push hard and hope your team sees IF not then just GROUP.\nZ) Nuff said.\n\nAlso 4v5s are winnable as long as you and your team work together.","replies":[]},{"poster":"redniwediS","date":"2016-06-20T03:09:20.824+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can win any game, except for the ones you can't.\n\nYou're describing the games that cannot be won.

It's optimistic and requires a little bit of extrapolation.  They are quite obviously assuming a real game situation, not some AFK or troll situation.

That's soooo terrible.\n\nStatistically, if you are one of the \"good\" people, there is higher probability of the enemy having useless players than your team (4 open spots on yours vs 5 on theirs).  With this, you may lose some games due to useless players, but the other team will have that happen more often.\n\nEven if it seems like it happens to you way more often than the other team, that is likely simply because people retain memory negative experiences more than they do positives ones.","replies":[]}]}
