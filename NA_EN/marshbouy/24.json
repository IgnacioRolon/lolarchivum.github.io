Calm your tits.\n\nEDIT: Lemme expand a bit on my argument. \nSo there are two versions of every champion, one that costs their normal amount of IP and one that costs 100x their normal IP. The one that costs 100x the normal IP is objectively better in every way. Damage, cooldowns, CC length, and base stats. Both are available to anyone playing the game, but the amount of effort needed to buy them differs. If you buy a champion version that is more powerful then it's cheaper counterpart, you will win more often because you put in X amount of hours to buy it. \nIs this fair? Is this balanced? Does this fit a competitive game? \nShould someone have a higher chance of beating someone else just because they put in more time, regardless of player skill? \nNo. this is not an MMO. This is not a game about grinding out in game currency to get an edge on your opponent. If you want to climb, you should have to have more skill than your opponent, not more in game currency or time played.

If a gamer can't make an effort then gaming is not for them. I never said league had shitty mechanics. I don't think league has shitty mechanics, just shitty players who can't make an effort and expect to be able to compete without that knowledge. The journey to level 30 provides one who actually gives a shit that knowledge. It is very possible to have two rune pages full of basic AP and AD runes and a few champions to boot. I know because I did it, 3 times, just like a lot of people who have played this game. These people are whining and bitching because that is what they do. They don't want to make an effort and anyone that does, they crucify because it makes them feel good about their pathetic failed lives.","replies":[{"poster":"Magmaprincess","date":"2017-06-01T20:11:30.594+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":">They don't want to make an effort and anyone that does, they crucify because it makes them feel good about their pathetic failed lives.\n\nYeah people with failed lives are kinda the last ones to complain about wasting time with pointless chores.

Things like being on a lan, everybody using the same computers, headsets, mics, and you know - teams that practice together and play together over and over again (plus little things like having weeks to prepare for a patch, more bans, remakes whenever a bug occurs in the game, etc). \n\nFor the normal player, its more \"fun-competitive\" than \"must-win-competitive\". Is it competitive? I did say (somewhere - not sure who i responded to) that its more competitive than P2W games or Minecraft or Fallout. Since you need to play against other people to win and that makes other people lose, it is obviously a competitive game. Is it equal-playing-field competitive? No. \n\nIf we are talking about competition, I think a bigger problem to competitive integrity is smurfs and the difficulty it is to demote. But we are supposed to believe that despite all the shortcomings of League to truly make a balanced, fair, competitive game, Runes are the biggest competitive advantage? \n\nAnd plus - I never said competition is bad.

Smurfs and the Tier system have a greater effect on competition than runes. Duos in solo queue are worse for the rank system.

Sure, you might not have an AP page with CDR and you might only have an AP page with MR, but how much of a difference does it ACTUALLY make? Not much - for every time you would have gotten a kill with the CDR page, you would have been saved with your MR page. \n\nEven some skins have a larger impact - its harder to see the animations or the particles for certain skins over the base skin. If we are talking about competition, shouldnt everyone be forced to use the base skin in Ranked?\n\nJust watch. People like to shift blame whenever they lose. \"If only I had different runes.\" \"If only I had more champions.\" This change will do nothing for competitive fairness.
