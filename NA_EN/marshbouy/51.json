Put them in Silver V.\n\nCompare the rates of climb when they get reset to ~ Gold II on new Season placements vs the Silver Climb.\n\nIt's likely going to take them 200-300 more games to climb 5 Brackets on the Silver than their Gold II.\n\nWhy? \n\nSilver V is like a Lottery. it's not about skill, or discipline, split pushing OR team play. It all goes out the window.\n\nEven if you have an illusion of skill in that elo, where your team dominates 25 to 5, that's usually all it is. An Illusion. Some or a couple on your team managed to get a very early First Blood/snowball, and create the illusion of a skill match, supported by gear and the charisma given to a team by a lead.\n\nAnd no matter how skilled you are in that elo..... a lottery team results in situations where unless you're playing a perma reset champ like {{champion:157}} {{champion:67}} {{champion:11}} {{champion:84}} {{champion:121}} {{champion:55}} {{champion:39}} ..... you still at best barely pull 50% win rates, even if you historically have 65% Kill participation and a 8 KDA.\n\nThe problem arrives from the fact that literally 55% of the population is in Silver, and about 20% are Bronze. About 75% of the community isn't actually learning game proficiencies. They are playing by impulse/for \"fun.\" and many just play retaliatory toward teammates who offend them.\n\nSo..... technically..... in some cases.... Yes. Shitty teammates do prevent climbs. However, in some of those cases, it's also the complainer. \n\nI've been Plat II or better since Season 4.\nBut..... I have 3 perma bans. I've had accounts start at Silver/Bronze to insufferable placements. Whereas I can go Gold V to Plat IV in about 100 games, Silver accounts I sometimes don't even get up to Gold in 300-400 games, because gameplay in silver is entirely different than in Gold or Plat. \n\nPlat: Quick to take advantage of team mistakes, but generally cautious lane phases, and laners help ward for junglers. Routinely buys Control Wards, and tries to keep early game deaths to a minimum. The game usually doesn't break out until after about 12 minutes.\n\nGold: Usually quick to take advantage of team mistakes, but often gets caught in Yolo lane skirmishes which starts a lane snowball. However, Junglers usually help compensate and minimize that poor decision making, softening it out. Covers junglers about 70% of the time. Buys some Control wards, and tries to keep game deaths to a minimum..... until the snowball starts. Game USUALLY doesn't break out until 10 minutes, but often drives hard to end the game once it does. Hard to stop the snowball.\n\nSilver: No one's really taking advantage of team mistakes. Instead they make a contest of who can make the least mistakes. Often gets tunneled on farming or pvp, or on base defense, but not all at the same time (Not multitaskers). They ward for themselves, or don't ward at all. They don't usually care about protecting a jungler at all, but still expect the jungler to be in their lane at all times. Junglers do not know how to use Drakes/objectives for the most part. Bot laners don't know that Drakes are team objectives, and almost ALWAYS recall when a Drake window arises. Buys about 3 total control wards a game. They view deaths as inconveniences but don't ever try to avoid them. Almost all chase kills, and the supports/tanks often die in the process of trying to save the chasers. \n\nGame often breaks out within 6 minutes, which sabotages cs rates, stable lane phases, and unless you are a hyper reset champ on a smurf, generally creates an entirely different game dynamic that's hard even for smurfs to adjust to. This means one team's adc is almost always useless because it takes twice as long to buy their first full item, which means csing is far less reliable. It means support's Levels are crippled by their adc's performances. It means Jungler's CS gets taken over by laners who care more about padding their gold than the fact they are bullying their own jungler's gold supply. It means almost all drakes are 1 team endeavors, because the losing team doesn't have enough pressure to even create a skirmish there, and the team's are usually not interested in congregating anyways.\n\nThe only real difference between Silver and Bronze? Silver players have moderate reaction times. Bronze doesn't react at all, and often freezes in place not knowing what to do.","replies":[{"poster":"Eedat","date":"2018-05-13T20:26:00.145+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"Errrr I'm just a mid gold player and on my other account I roflstomped my way through low Silver\n\n> I've been Plat II or better since Season 4.\n\nNo, you're a liar.

I used to run AD Eve, so the rework needed a new account to practice on the rework. \n\nIt didn't help that 1) the new Evelynn wasn't designed for the old runes (she couldn't even survive in a Baron pit because she had no defenses, no way to heal, etc) and 2) October was the Season of the Elo boosting Challengers playing alts to pass time and make money. (Gold was filled with Challenger level players playing {{champion:238}} {{champion:121}} {{champion:59}} who all own Eve's jungle pre 6 if they invade).\n\nAfter encountering a ton of Elo boosters, My Eve plummeted clear down to 13%. Most of those games even had positive Eve Scores... but I couldn't carry vs these mobile smurfs.\n\nI lost like 11 ranks in a row, because Evelynn was just so ill suited and unexplored.

They also all push to the opposing turret, so there are no good ganks, which means you either have to wait on spawn or risk invading the other jungle, assuming the other jungler isn't fed. She's just an inconvenience. \n\nI could easily climb with {{champion:245}} {{champion:11}} {{champion:45}} {{champion:103}} , but I don't get to play mid, and I hate Yi with a passion (too damn easy).

And I enjoyed playing her. And I was familiar with all her mechanics as well as power spikes and her trading pattern (yes, akali has power spikes she isn't always god tier, akali has mechanics, etc).\n\nIf you got to plat on your own. And you are playing your main role/champion. You will climb up to plat with ease.\nThere's no such thing as \"elo hell\" or \"team mates hold me back\".\n\nLook, teammates as skilled as yours will usually be in the enemy team as well (with some random times smurfs come along).\nIf you feel like your team mates are dragging you down every game, this means you cannot exploit the enemy teammates. So, you are not better than the enemy.\nThat's all there is to it.\n\nThe stronger the enemy is, the more we rely on our team to deal with it. Therefore, once the enemy are around a similar level to ours, we start seeing more flaws in our teammates because we rely on them more.\nHence, is not as much as your team mates holding you back.

You start with solid LP gains, good players (Gold players generally don't slack off in core competencies and are able to carry one bad actor), and yeah. I can believe that can result in a good climb.\n\nBut.... after this account got Banned in December, I made ANOTHER alt account. Had about a 68% win rate in Norms. I waited 2 1/2 weeks to rank its first season in Season 8.\n\nI didn't wait long enough.

That's not even enough games to get to Gold V winning 100%. You might reach Silver III, at which case you are still carrying 4 minute Turret loss Bronzies.\n\nAlso, Season 8 is a VERY different ranking beast than previous seasons. I've been around since Season 4. Go build another account and compare Season 8 with the new runes and nerfed/buff item rotations and compare it to previous seasons. Other players are generally right that Riot removed the carry potential this season from the averages. You need at least 1 good person on your team on average to pull off a carry now, whereas you used to be able to carry on singular performance.\n\nI'm pulling 68-70% Kill participations on {{champion:25}} support and can still lose with scores like 8/4/30, because I'm often stuck defending lanes while the team is feeding. If someone would rotate out of the team fights and protect their friggin base, I could leave, and go carry the team fight instead, and perhaps less people would die. but in 80% of the games I play, no one does that. They fight 4v5's while 2 of our lanes are full of siege minions, and no one's killing waves on ANY lanes. \n\nThey also weakened how fast mages can split push turrets.","replies":[{"poster":"Serika Zero","date":"2018-05-14T13:53:29.600+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I personally despite ranked games (one of the reasons I play so little ranked games).\n\nAlso, I've played in season 8, albeit only normal games (and pre season 8).

Since her rework (when she was the most uter trash jungle of them all), I decided to play jungle once more and pick her up (because i liked her and she wasn't op at that time).\nI could still influence my games a lot. \nBut she suffered the same problem as Akali, defensive supports like lulu, janna, etc prevent the assassination of enemy targets.\nSo yeh, i know how the new runes work and all that.\n\nYou can solo carry in the lower leagues.\nSimply exploit the enemy's mistakes. This works very well for mages or assassins or adcs and ofc fighters.\nWhile as support, you generally need to figure out who is the best player in your team and support that person.\n(I don't know how to play tanks, so, i won't comment or argue on tanks or other tanky units).\n\nAlso, is very frustrating for assassins when we keep seeing adcs hugged by their supports.

I might after they move Ultimate Hat.  Teams don't always let you get to a point where Phase Rush hits off (but they are buffing that too) Not running Electrocute is probably why I don't hypercarry her in low elos, as much as the bad lane ethics.\n\nAtm I can hyper carry Gold more than Silver though, because they actually know what freezing a lane is. Silver will just argue with you that freezing a lane is impossible.\n\nI can deal with pink wards. I can't deal with players who don't set up the right formulas for their jungle to perform.\n\nPersonally I hate Akali as a Nami player. She's one of the only champs Nami can't shut down. The .78 second Q delay = Akali smoke screens or R's out of the bubble. If you Ult, she can W forward and the wave misses her. Even if the Wave hits, by the time the Bubble hits, Akali STILL R's.
