High amounts of damage on the bullets/abilities but fairly long cooldowns, much like a snpier in real life has to reload before shooting again. \r\nHis abilities are all fairly unique. His passive is essentially trigonometry, his Q is a point and click that still takes skill to land if you want max damage, his W is a great utility and sniping tool, his E is a unique trap (unlike other ones {{champion:17}} {{champion:51}} it allows you to walk out of it), and his ult is simply amazing. \r\nHis ult allows for a lot more counterplay than people give it, you can dodge, block, and walk out of the range of the bullets. It leaves him vulnerable while he his ulting so good positioning is rewarded.\r\n\r\nDon&#039;t even get me started on his VO and visual effects. Killing someone with him just looks beautiful(as it should).\r\n\r\nGood on you rito, you made a well designed champion.\r\nNow im just waiting for duskblade to be meelee only ;-;","replies":[{"poster":"TheLazySunbro","date":"2016-08-03T14:48:07.063+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":3,"body":"I hate ADC Role\nBut so far Jhin {{champion:202}} is the only one I had fun with \n\nGood Champ for me","replies":[{"poster":"Marshbouy","date":"2016-08-03T14:49:08.341+0000","up_votes":33,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'd play him more but i suck ass at\ncsing\nkiting\norbwalking\nlanding abilities\nplaying league\n\ndamn, im not good at a lot of stuff. \noh well time to play more {{champion:17}} and {{champion:16}}","replies":[{"poster":"Verdade","date":"2016-08-03T15:45:47.274+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":15,"body":"you won't improve at all by playing these tho...","replies":[{"poster":"Marshbouy","date":"2016-08-03T16:31:46.753+0000","up_votes":27,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's the point.

You will weaken your champion's effectiveness against groups of enemies by buying Duskblade, so I personally think it's fair. Sure, if he hits minions 3 times and then a champion a 4th then the Duskblade really packs a wallop, but as players have mentioned in other comments, that will leave him vulnerable while he's reloading.\n\nI actually haven't managed to finish buying a Runaan's Hurricane as Jhin yet. Everytime I try we have won the game or lost it before I could get to that point, but I'm curious as to how good it is on him.
