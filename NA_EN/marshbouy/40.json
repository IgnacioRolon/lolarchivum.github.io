The Movement Speed and heal Fiora gets from her passive doesn't exactly help with that, either; and even if she misses, her Q will automatically target a minion instead and refund a lot of its cooldown. \n\nIn terms of frustration this is basically nothing compared to other champions in lane. But I think it could be fixed much easier than other champions' frustration, too -- by reducing her Q range by a *little bit*. \nThis change might not actually work, though.

That word can easily be abused.  \n \nBut what I mean when I say frustrating is that I don't feel like I can fight back in any way, or that I could have done that better. This might be due to lack of knowledge on how to play against certain champions or how to play in certain situations.   \nAgainst Miss Fortune you just don't stand behind low Health minion.   \nAgainst Shaco you try to predict where he'll show up and get your teammates help to shut him down. Vision control is also essential.  \nAnd against Gangplank you can kill his barrels and/or stand far enough away so he doesn't land them on you. \n\nAgainst Fiora I only know that I can press myself against a wall if her passive is on my side and that I can play more aggressive if it's behind me. But if I have to walk a bit further out to get a creep she will proc it and there is nothing I can do against that. I can damage her, but she'll heal back up. In the worst case she'll fight back now that she's procced her passive once. It respawns immediately. She'll get another, and then another. I can CC her, but if I only have one source of CC she will be anticipating it. So I need to stay far away and poke her if I can but then I'll lose cs. \n\nWhat I would like to see is for Fiora to have to make a decision when proccing her passive. A decision to possibly put herself out of position to get it. I don't feel like she has to right now.\n \nThat being said, it isn't the worst thing in the game. Fiora isn't hard to deal with anymore in the mid to late game.

A lot of champions out damage her and she has a huge amount of outplay potential and there are several hard counter's for her that just make her useless. \n\nYes the fiora does have to make a decision, because all of her match ups are skill match ups or counter's to her she has the complete and total possibility of loosing a trade for 1 vital proc. It happens to me all the time, i'll go in for one and get instantly half healthed because it's easy to predict were i'm going to stop dashing and were i'm going, in addition she cannot use her W until the end of her dash, meaning AOE stuns will work on her if timed correctly like say from a lissandra. Finally if you need to walk out of the range of her passive then back in to reset the vital, forcing the fiora to have to deal with it being in a different spot. It's pretty frustrating when someone does that to me especially if it's someone i know i can't fight.\n\nI honestly think you just have an aversion to her, i have an aversion to Renekton, i just can't stop myself from feeding and i feel like there is nothing i can do even if i play safe he's just gonna dive me. \n\n\nCounter's to fiora that i'v seen: Renekton, Gangplank, Malphite, Tryndamere, Kayle, Ekko, Illaoi, Pantheon, Swain(lots of sustain, slows, roots), Quinn and Lissandra. \n\nIf the fiora is really good she can still win against those but those are all pretty hard matchups for her, the higher your ELO the more frustrating fighting fiora will get but if you want to have a chance those are the champs that i'v had trouble with while playing fiora.\n\nThe illaoi one i'll explain though, its a mind game with this one, you need to be able to bait out the Fiora's W and because she has no CC you don't have to worry about being stunned back or something. Fiora has to get really close to fight you and that's what Illaoi loves more than anything, the only thing the illaoi has to do is keep up with her while she's moving from vital to vital, you out sustain her as illaoi even if she does percent health damage, it won't bother illaoi as much due to her massive sustain. \n\nI'v lost horribly to an illaoi 3 times as fiora but only beaten one once with her.
