Not exactly. \n\nhttps://i.gyazo.com/bffd3c33b98aa81c88c9c8ccf24e8da8.png\n\n3 out of the top 4 are exclusively AP. 4 out of ten total (or just 3/10 if you don't count gragas which I personally don't because champions like him, Zac, Sejuani and Amumu are picked mainly for their CC and tank above anything else). There are only about 6 or so AP champs picked jungle in total. \n\nThose numbers are very comparable to the top tier AD mid champions. Why aren't people asking for AP junglers to be taken down to a lower level?

They could simply design champions for the bot lane position which are not marksmen instead.\nLike they did with other positions, for example Ivern who was designed to be an enchanter played in the jungle. Yet no one demands that Ivern should be able to be an effective top laner.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"TehNACHO","date":"2018-10-03T17:51:25.090+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">They are marskmen with the possibility to build ap for mixed damage\n\nThat's the point.","replies":[{"poster":"Ahri Inari","date":"2018-10-03T22:17:16.404+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And that's not what we want.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"RyzeTheSmurfMage","date":"2018-10-03T07:07:46.203+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Most of the AP ones are AP assasins...","replies":[]},{"poster":"LeftyRaydy","date":"2018-10-03T19:03:35.229+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First off there is way less AD mid lane champ vs AP in fact I only count 4 statically relevant AD mind laners (Yasuo, Zed, Irelia, and Talon). So mid lane should have mostly AP champs in the line up. Also champs that were issues had some nerfs. Talon, Wukong, item nerfs because of how powerful they were. Now looking into top 10 most played champions in the game all regions all Elos currently is this. \n\nhttps://www.leagueofgraphs.com/champions/stats/all\n1. Lee Sin Jungler\n2. Thresh Support\n3. Kai'Sa AD Carry\n4. Yasuo Mid, Top\n5. Miss Fortune AD Carry\n6. Jhin  AD Carry\n7. Lucian AD Carry\n8. Jax Jungler, Top\n9. Ezreal AD Carry\n10. Vayne  AD Carry\n\n7 out of 10 are AD for most played champs (I excluded Kai sa, Thresh, and Jax as yo are not going to see heave AD itemization on them) but 0 AP champs are in the top 10 played.\n\nHighest Win rates all regions all ranks is https://www.leagueofgraphs.com/champions/stats/all/by-winrate\n1. Sion top 53.1%\n2. Miss Fortune 53.1%\n3. Ahri Mid 53%\n4. Nami 53%\n5. Yorick Top 52.7%\n6.  Brand Support/Mid 52.6\n7. Garen Top 52.6\n8. Malzahar Mid 52.5%\n9. Nocturne Jungle 52.5%\n10.  Sona Support 52.4%\n\nNothing particularly special here. \nOVERLOOKING the fact that there is like 3 relevant mid laners, Overall I believe that Ahri mid is the problem here.  https://www.leagueofgraphs.com/champions/stats/middle/all\n\nAhri Mid 11.8% Pick Rate 52.9% Win Rate\nYasuo Mid 12.5% Pick Rate 50.1% Win Rate\nZed Mid 11.8% Pick Rate 49.2% Win Rate\nTalon Mid 5.0% Pick Rate 48.7% Win Rate\nIrelia Mid 5.6% Pick Rate 50.1% Win Rate\n11.8 + 12.5 + 11.8  + 5 + 5.6 this is 46-47% of the games have these 5 champs. Excluding Talon and Irelia 35% of games will have Ahri, Zed, or Yasuo. meaning that if Ahri is winning more games they are obviously losing more. So until Ahri is put into a good spot these champs will continue to Ahri making their win rates worse. Anyway this post is mis leading as there are not enough AD mids.","replies":[]}]}
