I always get entire teams full of 100% AP supports who can&#039;t and won&#039;t do the literal one and only thing they will ever focus on, and the few that do attempt to can&#039;t even do that.\n\nNo one pushes.\n\nNo one defends.\n\nNo one goes for objectives.\n\nNo one plays the tank so we get no peel.\n\nNo one has range.\n\nNo one has magic damage so I have to stack armor pen and build {{item:3087}} .\n\nNo one has crowd control.\n\nNo one has armor piercing.\n\nNo one has Grevious Wounds so I need to get Executioner&#039;s Calling.\n\nNo one has Magic Penetration.\n\nNo one is the support, since we keep getting ones with no sightstone and a Deathcap.\n\nNo one wards cause my support has no sightstone, and my jungler was a Nidalee.\n\nNo one ward sweeps cause my support forgot to trade in the trinket for a sweeper and decided to get {{item:3092}}  instead of {{item:2301}} , even though the latter means they get both damage and vision.\n\nNo one watches the minimap.\n\nNo one scouts, so I need to constantly build {{item:3363}} \n\nAnd as it turns out, no one wants to actually deal damage, either. They just want the kills. Every fucking game I&#039;ve been in since the pre-season, all the support mains do the least amount of damage out of everyone on the team, and since the entire team is composed of nothing but full AP supports with no gold income but taking kills, NO ONE DEALS DAMAGE. They expect the yasuo to do it all; every last goddamn thing I listed, AND MORE. And then they have the balls to come on the forums and complain about how imbalanced the game is. YOU ALL ARE THE IMBALANCED ONES.\n\nTo make matters worse, people have abandoned reading anything in the changelogs, and are forgetting what any and all champions do. It&#039;s like Alzheimer&#039;s has affected the entire community.\n\nJUST A COUPLE TWEAKS TO THAT POST, AND LOOK AT WHAT I GOT!
