When you realize as a marksmen you don't need to focus the player that's mitigating your damage, why would you? Obviously your range allows you to hit higher priority targets that aren't building armor. \n\nBesides cost efficiency is not even part of it, it's slot efficiency. If Last Whisper items allow you to get rid of the tank in front of you then buy it. But if you can handle having a tank stick to you then keep investing into high damage items to get rid of the enemy carries. So what if you get armor pen, it doesn't mean that armor is ignored outright, even if you are attack the tank as a marksmen you're sinking damage into someone who is built to take damage. If anything you're doing the tank the favor for having them properly play their role. Whereas the damage done to a tank could have been enough to kill the support or the other marksmen. You only buy armor pen as a marksmen if you HAVE to fight front to back, tanks first then back line. Other then that, don't waster basic attacks on a champ whose role IS to soak damage ie make your damage suck into them completely worthless for you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Thefrostyviking","date":"2019-07-09T14:22:04.260+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Do tell me though, do you think a guy with 150 armor and ...say 2300 health can survive more than 2-3 seconds while under focused fire from more than 2 damage carries?\n\n\nEven if those do not have penetration?.......To be the answer as i see it is never yes. \n\n\nThe goal is to wipe the enemy team and survive, kill that enemy tank 2-3 seconds faster is not worth it if it means you either die in the process or miss the chance to kill his team.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Abibyama II","date":"2019-07-09T07:58:34.384+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Like OP said, It's about agency\n\nNobody wants to play tank or build tank because that would mean they would have to rely on teammates which is something nobody wants to do and would  rather be the main character of a battle shounen.","replies":[]},{"poster":"chipndip1","date":"2019-07-09T18:22:48.576+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"People will **never** admit it: No one wants to play around tanks in solo queue for tank effective to matter to begin with.\n\nAre top lane tanks in a bad spot?

I'm sorry, but if the game's not a stomp and you're not 1v5'ing, you're not dying THAT fast as a tank.\n\nSo now that people are complaining about people not \"needing\" pen to deal with tanks. Who the hell plays tanks to care about pen stats not being built? People complain about all AD comps being \"more viable than ever\", but who's playing tanks when one shows up?
