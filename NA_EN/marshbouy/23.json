Someone deleted the post in about 1 minute which means someone read the post.  And since it was ready so quickly, we can assume everyone else's posts on the topic have also been read.  Ergo we can assume one of two things.\n\n1. Riot is leaving Xerath up, to purge a bunch of cheaters from the game.  OR\n2. They don't give a fuck.\n\nI'm hoping for option 1.","replies":[{"poster":"Fairyfleur","date":"2017-04-14T01:31:05.354+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"They publicly said they're going with option 1.

It would not even have to be complicated, just a simple button press of maybe a math problem of \"1+1=?\" with a simple randomized plate of 3 to 6 numbers where if its not answered within X seconds after 'connecting' to the match and being 'in' the game, then it forces a remake right there and immediately kicks that character out alongside putting that account's name on a list to be queued up for banning after its been confirmed its a bot.\n\nIt may sound annoying but what's more annoying? Having to drag & click your mouse once at the start of a match OR having to deal with a feeding bot player because all 'bot made scripts' are extremely pathetic at playing, especially against actual players? The only time they actually work being if the scripted bot is using a overpowered character and the 'actual opposing player' doesn't know how to properly play against Champion A.\n\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}} \n\nSolves an annoying problem, likely even stomp down on 'account sellers' too if that is still a thing on LoL(because why else would players be throwing in fully scripted bots into matches besides to be: \"Annoying, testing out scripts or just plain want to troll actual players?\"), then maybe LoL could divert some more focus towards things like fixing up the game and having less reports to have to sift thru(which i'm sure a good deal are rants about annoying scripted bots ruining matches and the same with script hacks).","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Nhifu","date":"2017-04-14T01:38:56.153+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If Yasuo gets disabled they'll lose profit, so never :P","replies":[]}]}
