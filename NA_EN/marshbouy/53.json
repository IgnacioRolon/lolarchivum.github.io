Look at the recent MSI game CLG vs RNG. NA was going against the #1 undefeated Chinese team. They battled on while down 20k gold. twenty-thousand gold. They won. They won because they knew they had a better teamfight comp, and that if they can survive until everyone has items and gold leads becomes obsolete, they can win teamfights and the game.\n\nSo no, I don't care if the enemy team's ADC is fed and 5 shotting our tanks 25 minutes into the game, because if I see that my team can get their shit together and turn it around in the next 15 minutes and stomp - I'm not going to surrender.\n\nAnd also keep in mind that some people are better at different stages of the game. Some are bad at laning phase. Some are bad at mid-game objectives, Some are bad at lane pushing. Some are bad in teamfights. If you're team doesn't know how to take objectives, they might be godly in late game teamfights.

Incompetent teammates have a far larger impact than decent teammates. Depending on who you and your opponents get paired with, some games are guaranteed wins or loses.\n\nThat said, I've also noticed a trend that all my friends above Gold rarely surrenders.\nEven if your team is 10k behind in Gold, there is still a chance you can win. Forfeiting the game means that you give up that chance. In every game, no matter the circumstance, you need to play as if you can win. If you are unwilling to do this, get out of ranked. You won't ever get a decent rank with a poor attitude.\n\nOn the current patch, all it takes is one good team fight in the late game to win. If your ADC is alive, you can break through all 5 towers down mid during the death timers.

By that, I don't mean TF players who go 0/3 against Zed or junglers who accidentally gave a double kill due to an outplay. I'm referring to those who are trolling, those who have no idea how to play their champions, and those who are boosted.\nFrom my recent ranked games, I can only think of 2 instances in which I encountered these kind of players in my game.

My team still managed to drag the game out to 40+ minutes, but atlas she got caught and we lost. It was probably inevitable, but my team and I still played the game out.\nIn the other game, I had a Leona one trick who got hard countered. She flamed the entire team after feeding despite everyone else telling her that she can't just engage as Leona against Morgana in lane. I was playing with friends during that game, and we surrendered that one because we didn't want to deal with her.\n\nUnless your teammates are bad, don't surrender.
