I've never seen a better item on {{champion:497}} than {{item:3193}}, it's perfect for when you W into a large group of enemies (as well as during ult). Not just him either, I'm sure it's beautiful on other champs too! (I also build it on Janna but that's just my anti-last hit button late game, probably not for everyone though it is fun juking Veiger ult's as Janna.)","replies":[{"poster":"captainkaiger","date":"2017-05-12T05:13:39.306+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Honestly, I'd prefer if Stoneplate had a different active.

It's saved my ass in almost every game I've built it in since being added to the game. \n\nAt the very least it's a good starting point for appropriate tuning.","replies":[{"poster":"captainkaiger","date":"2017-05-12T21:43:10.748+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Might be just me and my experience with it.
