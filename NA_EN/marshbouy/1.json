The quick answer is, most of the vocal community is made up of people who really don&#039;t understand the game, are very entitled about what they want, and/or refuse to consider other viewpoints than their own. \n\nThe long answer is, the community is extremely varied in what they want and it is impossible to satisfy all. \nFor instance, for every person who wants AD melee bruisers to become the top lane meta, there is also a person who wants the good old days of aura whore Jarvan+1. For every person who loves the diversity of top lane, there is a person who wants mages and ranged characters to be kicked out of it. For every person who loves the current meta of toplane, there is someone who wants the &quot;good ole days&quot; of renekton meta+2. For every person who hates ADCs and wants juggernauts like Garen to be great again, there is someone who despises juggernauts and wants them to continue to be gutted. \n\nDoes this mean riot should never listen to the community? No. If every ELO is having issues with a champion, they should be changed somehow. If high ELO is having issues with a champion, they should be changed somehow. There are plenty of instances where riot should listen to the community, but there are many more occasions where Riot shouldn&#039;t because listening to group 1 would completely shaft group 2. \n\n+1 this build was basically _build every aura item in the game and support your team by giving them shitloads of stats_\n+2 this was basically &quot;can X champion face renekton? If yes, they can play top lane, if no, they can&#039;t play top lane&quot;\n\nEDIT: guys. Read the fucking post. \nEDIT: wow. two rioter responses. \n\nEDIT: To clarify what I mean. I'm not stating this as \"I am smarter than riot and they should listen to me\" but as \"I am going to point out why the community is difficult to listen to.\" The misunderstanding comes into play in a few ways\n-clickbaity title\n-i'm not great at writing\n-i'm super used to talking about riot in a bubble, assuming that they are not going to read/respond to the post and using them as a springboard to make a point\n\nand seriously\n#READ THE POST BEFORE COMMENTING","replies":[{"poster":"Ghostcrawler","date":"2017-06-22T22:24:47.298+0000","up_votes":64,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey Marshbouy,\n\nThe way I see it, we are most effective as developers when we listen to the community as a source of feedback to help us make informed decisions. So in a way I agree that it's risky to just do whatever players suggest and hope for some kind of wisdom of crowds magic. It's not that we should pick and choose which players to listen to - it's more that you listen to all the feedback and begin to develop a picture of what is really going on.\n\nTaking a step back even farther, what is the point of having game developers if all they're doing is taking in community feedback and acting on it? We hire people because they have good judgment and intuition (and sometimes also a lot of experience). Part of that skill is knowing which parts of the feedback to listen to, or to figure out when players are talking about X, that the actual problem is really Y.\n\nI used to be a scientist (not necessarily a great scientist, mind you), so let me try this analogy. It's really dangerous to throw out data just because you don't like what it says, or even because you aren't sure how to interpret it. But it is the interpretation that's really important. That's where you really learn something. If I am reading the work of another scientist, I generally skip over their data. I just want to see the conclusion, and I'll only go back to the data if I think something smells fishy and I want to see it myself.\n\nApplying that to players, you don't want to dismiss community feedback just because it seems contradictory or because you don't understand it. But the magic comes from interpreting that feedback and using it to make changes that do improve the game over the long run.","replies":[{"poster":"KnightsKemplar","date":"2017-06-22T22:31:33.573+0000","up_votes":38,"down_votes":4,"body":"I am a simple man.

Everyone has the **right to an opinion**, absolutely, yes. The _**validity**_ of an opinion however, is based on the merit of _**reasoning and evidence**_; there's a difference.\n\nYour post is contradicting the two between it's statement and reasoning. An opinion with false information or flawed reasoning is the main concept behind an 'opinion that doesn't matter'; It doesn't contribute any real validation.\n\n\nThis is why a lot of people get confused in the subject, people have not been properly taught critical thinking, so what you get is a platform in which anyone can just spout off statements and declare them as fact. There's a lack of emphasis on credible opinions (posts that support statements with reasoning and evidence). Everyone has become so relaxed with making posts that just declare a statement with the passive assumption that \"I am right\", bearing no logic or factual evidence behind it.\n\n\n**An opinion is merely a _subjective_  viewpoint, judgement, or idea, not necessarily based on fact.

There are plenty of instances where riot should listen to the community, but there are many more occasions where Riot shouldn't because listening to group 1 would completely shaft group 2.\n\nThis is really all you needed to say. Riots problem is that they are just plain bad at listening and implementing good ideas(or listening to complaints to stop bad changes ie {{champion:134}} rework, {{champion:5}} buffs etc). Good devs should listen to their community and then(since they have access to the tools to really test good ideas) filter through what's good and what's not. then communicate communicate, and communicate! Riot just plain stonewalls the community(like they do after EVERY class update(which fortunately they listened enough to stop doing them now)) sometimes and refuses to address legit concerns people have. That's my problem with them anyway. Obviously, they don't need to listen to some guy who just got crapped on by (insert champion here*) and is just venting, but they DO need to start listening much more to people who make legitimate arguments and concerns.","replies":[{"poster":"Sqkerg","date":"2017-06-22T22:54:17.129+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"The thing is they are listening.

How bout letting people make their argument and not assigning one to them?\nMy argument is that they aren't COMMUNICATING enough. Obviously this is not an objective matter and this is my opinion, but i think that they don't communicate enough and when they do, they are overly worried about keeping surprises. My little joke about not having enough faith, is that i judge based on what i can actually see.

Sure, a person acting like they're qualified on a topic they're really not might not formulate the best opinion on said topic, but that can be found out on its own, and those kinds of people only form a relatively small portion of the players on Boards, contrary to what many people think. Most of the complaints here tend to be more general and are honest expressions of the player's own subjective opinion (e.g. \"I don't like playing against Riven\"), and sometimes are substantiated by external information to support their point, so even if a player might not be Challenger or as informed as Riot, they are still capable of contributing.\n\nWhat I think the real issue is on Gameplay, though, is that opinions tend to be expressed only in extremes, with little to no room for nuance, and often lose sincerity when they're used mainly to play to the crowd here, rather than to communicate honestly with Riot and work towards a solution. All too often, the community here likes to draw arbitrary lines in the sand where those on one side are X mains, and those on the other are X fanboys, and that only leads to antagonism and pointless arguments. That kind of mentality pretends that balance and design are always a zero-sum game, where making one side happy will make the other equally unhappy, but in reality that's not how it works, and if we dropped this useless name-calling we'd be able to work much better towards common ground.","replies":[{"poster":"OP Garen Support","date":"2017-06-23T15:10:52.771+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are times when the angry mob who upvotes themselves are the loudest on the boards like the {{champion:107}}  mains.\nIn reality us older players dont want back the old Rengar because he was very antifun with his ability to 1 shot any carry with no counter play.\n\nSimple solution would be to have every players fill out a QUIZ of feedback when logging in to the game.

I personally don't believe reverting Rengar back to his previous state will leave him in a good place, because he really lacked interactivity back then, but I also don't think his rework really helped him, and believe he will need another gameplay update farther down the line.\n\nAgain, this isn't a war between Rengar mains and everyone else, it's a lot of people with opinions about Rengar who are all pooling their opinions together, perhaps not always with a common interest at heart, but certainly with an interest in seeing Rengar improve.
