I didn&#039;t really stand a chance(i can't fight against renekton for shit. im bad, i know) until i got a few items, so i took my pure tank masteries (as opposed to my AD/AS ones). \nI took TP instead of ignite or ghost, started {{item:2033}} , and built {{item:3742}}  first. I played it safe and didn&#039;t tilt, froze lane, urged my jungler not to gank because it would be a waste of time, and waited.\n\nWe still lose that game (Entirely because of our botlane going 0/6 and having a full AP janna mid that finished a 24 minute game with only 40 cs), but i ended up with a better score then renekton in the end. \n\nToo often i see people lock in riven after the enemy picked pantheon, start {{item:1036}} and their normal AD/CDR runes, and proceed to die 6 times, blame their jungler for not helping, and afk.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-10-09T23:10:47.817+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You run down lane and blame team, right?","replies":[{"poster":"oSEXYPLATYPUSo","date":"2016-10-09T23:15:57.007+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MagicFlyingLlama,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=eAA1mpOI,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2016-10-09T23:10:47.817+0000)\n>\n> You run down lane and blame team, right?\n\nwrong...\n\nits ritos fault for matching me with unskilled trolls who feed and afk and making it unfair match making giving the other team the only good players and im stuck trying to carry a team of players who should uninstall","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-10-10T01:51:52.852+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Exactly, that is why you run down lane and blame team.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Marshbouy","date":"2016-10-09T23:15:15.818+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"sounds accurate","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Zoeeee","date":"2016-10-09T23:31:12.939+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:2}}  vs {{champion:122}}  is almost impossible to win.
