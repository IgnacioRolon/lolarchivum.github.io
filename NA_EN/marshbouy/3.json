I'm just stating a fact of what has happened in past seasons regarding this topic. You cannot deny, as an frequent boards poster yourself, that this is a topic that gets mentioned every season and rarely generates any positive or constructive discussion. \n\nHigh ranked games, all games, are win or lose. Every opportunity you can find to get an edge on your opponent is crucial to winning. Caps saw a window and played the situation he and Leblanc put themselves in and he came our the winner in that scenario. Whether you agree with it or not, in high ranked matches, in these outcomes, there is no time to pout over X being what it is. The best anyone can do is pick yourself up and do better. Honestly, what's to say about the Leblanc players character if their jerk reaction to Caps play was to just rage. \n\nI also don't follow what you mean by TTK. Google can't provide me with the context you're using it in.\n\nFinally I don't see 'damage being high' as a problem but more as an excuse anyone will put onto the boards to garner attention. That's just my opinion. And like anyone who strong stands by their opinion of damage being too much of a problem because its broadly describe as 'high. Then I take the same stance on my opinion that it isn't. \n\nBut you know. Contrarian. I dig it. But don't waste all your wit on me dude. I'm just as much as nuisance to you as you are to me. \n\nGL HF on your next game that has **Too high damage ™**","replies":[{"poster":"Marshbouy","date":"2019-07-23T14:06:17.192+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":">High ranked games, all games, are win or lose.
