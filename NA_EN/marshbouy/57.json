However, they DO stack with each other for a multiplicative effect.\n\nIt's not that Armor or Health becomes less efficient as you purchase more and more on top of what you already have. As you get more Health, any additional Armor you buy afterward does more to increase your survivability than it would have if you had bought the Armor without buying Health first.\nBuying more and more Health is not getting any less efficient. It's making potential Armor purchases *more* efficient, which means that while 1000 health is still exactly as good as the previous 1000 health, it would have been a better idea to get some Armor instead. *This goes the other direction too!*\n\nYou do seem to understand how armor works, but you're looking at it from the wrong angle. 100 armor is 50% damage reduction, 200 armor is 67% damage reduction, 300 is 75% damage reduction, and so on, exactly as you said. It *appears* as though those numbers are increasing by less and less each time. But look at it this way; 100 armor (50% reduction) turns 1000 health into 2000 health, 200 (67%) turns it into 3000 health, 300 (75%) turns it into 4000. Every 100 armor increases your Effective HP by 100% of your Max Health.\n\nSo despite each stat being additive by itself, Health multiplies Armor, and Armor multiplies Health. If you have 100 armor and buy 500 health, you're actually increasing your EHP by 1000. If you then buy another 100 armor, that 500 health is now effectively 1500 health; exactly the same increase that you got from the first 100 armor.\n\n**TL;DR** There's no diminishing returns. It's actually *increased* returns on every other defensive stat, which by comparison makes additional stacking of one stat, while *not less efficient*, not *as* efficient as the alternative stats, which creates the illusion of diminishing returns. You don't get any less out of buying tons and tons of health, but you would get more by buying some armor instead.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/1HvNiEO.png?noredirect","replies":[{"poster":"MunchCrunchLunch","date":"2016-08-19T21:07:13.714+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":7,"body":"lmao. are you joking.  the mathematical formular is designed to have diminishing returns so you can't get 100% damage reduction. its FACTUALLY designed that way. the damage reduction increase. falls off. and that is a fact. if i get 100 armor. i have 50% damage reduction. if i get an another 100. that isn't giving me an additional 50% damage reduction. thats how you look at it. there are diminishing returns.  that is a fucking fact\n\nhow the fuck does armor not have diminishing returns. just like MR. health. does not have diminishing returns. it gives you. a line of stats. its not multiplicative by itself. armor however.

The numbers given when you mouse over the stat tell you how much damage reduction you're getting, but it's more accurate to say that armor is increasing the amount of damage you can take before you die. Starting from 0 armor, every 1 unit of armor you get increases the amount of damage you can take (and the amount of time you can survive consistent dps) by 1%. It's perfectly linear forever, though obviously in practice it's capped by how many item slots are available.\n\nBut just because armor does NOT have diminishing returns, that doesn't mean that 6 Thornmails is a good build. Aside from the obvious waste of the unique passive on 5 of those and the lack of other useful passives from other items, it's inefficient because the health value being multiplied by all that armor is nothing more than your champion's base health.\n\nDespite having it wrong, thinking of armor as having diminishing returns doesn't hurt you; the end result is that you still build a mix of health and resists, even if your reasoning for it is incorrect.\n\nThe main takeaway from this is a better way to think about armor and health while in-game. With the correct thought process you can know in seconds whether you'd be better served by buying more health, more armor, or just a Randuin's.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/1HvNiEO.png?noredirect","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shadowatom","date":"2016-08-19T22:34:45.583+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MunchCrunchLunch,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=0xVaAIhV,comment-id=00050000,timestamp=2016-08-19T21:07:13.714+0000)\n>\n> lmao. are you joking.  the mathematical formular is designed to have diminishing returns so you can&#x27;t get 100% damage reduction. its FACTUALLY designed that way. the damage reduction increase. falls off. and that is a fact. if i get 100 armor. i have 50% damage reduction. if i get an another 100. that isn&#x27;t giving me an additional 50% damage reduction. thats how you look at it. there are diminishing returns.  that is a fucking fact\n\nHe acknowledges this, saying that the extra 100 armor (for 200 armor total) would equate to 67% damage reduction to AD, so... you agree there.\n\n> how the fuck does armor not have diminishing returns. just like MR. health. does not have diminishing returns. it gives you. a line of stats. its not multiplicative by itself. armor however.

If you buy 1000 HP when you already had 1000 HP, then you have 2000 HP (common sense of course), but this effectively reduces any damage taken by 50% _compared_ to when you only had 1000 HP. Buying another 1000 HP on top of that then reduces it by 67% _compared_ to when you had the original 1000 HP.\n\n1000 HP - 500 AD = 500 HP (50% HP lost)\n2000 HP - 500 AD = 1500 HP (25% HP lost, cut by 50% compared to 1k HP) \n3000 HP - 500 AD = 2500 HP (16.7% HP lost, cut by 33.4% compared to 1k HP)\n4000 HP - 500 AD = 3500 HP (12.5% HP lost, cut by 25% compared to 1k HP)\n\nNow with Armor instead of HP:\n\n1000 HP + 0 Armor (+0.0 x Max HP) - 500 AD = 500 HP (50% HP lost)\n1000 HP + 100 Armor (+1.0 x Max HP) - 500 AD = 750 HP (25% HP lost, cut by 50% compared to 0 Armor)\n1000 HP + 200 Armor (+2.0 x Max HP) - 500 AD =  833 HP (16.7% HP lost, cut by 33.4% compared to 0 Armor)\n1000 HP + 300 Armor (+3.0 x Max HP) - 500 AD = 875 HP (12.5% HP lost, cut by 25% compared to 0 Armor)\n\nWhat if we alternated?\n\n1000 HP + 0 Armor (+0.0 x Max HP) - 500 AD = 500 HP (50% HP lost)\n2000 HP + 0 Armor (+0.0 x Max HP) - 500 AD = 1500 HP (25% HP lost)\n2000 HP + 100 Armor ( +1.0 x Max HP) - 500 AD = 1750 HP (12.5% HP lost)\n3000 HP + 100 Armor ( +1.0 x Max HP) - 500 AD = 2751 HP (8.3% HP lost)\n\nYou may look at this and say, diminishing returns, duh; however, like you said, HP _doesn't have diminishing returns_ and if HP doesn't have diminishing returns, then this proves that Armor and MR don't have diminishing returns either.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"BloodyTompon","date":"2016-08-19T15:26:19.090+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":">From my knowledge if you have 500 armor and 2k health you have 10k EHP against AD, but that doesn't seem right.

Those numbers don't seem to add up.\n\nIt's not contradictory. A lot of it comes down the the language used. There is a diminishing returns in terms of damage reduction (which is what you see on the display). There is no diminishing returns in terms of armours increase to EHP (it's static/linear at 1%). Think of it like acceleration and speed. When acceleration is linear, speed is not. EHP has no diminishing returns ( linear), damage reduction does (not linear). The reasons I disagree with the statement 'armour has diminishing returns' is because the concept of interest is not the damage reduction that is displayed. It's the amount of damage required to die - that is EHP and that has no diminishing returns. \n\nNow, that doesn't mean that armour is always gold efficient nor optimal. EHP relies on both resistances and HP. Shadow has a nice reply for this part. So does GaleWinUnleashed.
