I just looked through your violation history, and the closest thing I can see is a amusing video post you made in **Memes & Games** that was redirected to **General Discussion**, followed by a non-humorous video you posted that was redirected to **Streams & Videos** as it was definitely a discussion/analysis of a mage-based meta. I could see an argument for leaving the latter or moving it into Gameplay, but I don't see any post on this account that was moved from Gameplay to Player Behavior or back.\n\nI'd love to look into this for you if you have the name of the account in question, as there is no action like this on this account's violation history.","replies":[{"poster":"OP Garen Support","date":"2018-03-23T14:09:23.399+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This did not happen to me recently.
