I used to be super toxic, I think I afked after raging at my team at least 3 times in a week. After I would cool down and go do something else, I always feared the impending punishments. \r\nBut they never came, ever. \r\nThis really hurt my trust in the report system. Anyone who looked at my chat logs would realize I was being incredibly toxic. The only things I didn&#039;t call my teammates were the big no no words, the ones that get censored with % on the boards. \r\nEventually I cleaned up my act, now I rarely say anything toxic except for maybe a sarcastic &quot;GJ Yasuo&quot; when they dive 1v3 and die. \r\n\r\nI seriously question if reporting people does anything anymore.","replies":[{"poster":"Rito Wuks","date":"2017-08-28T07:02:18.558+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"_This thread has been archived.

Most of what Ulanopo has said is good, great, and grand when taken at face value.  However there are several areas where they (Riot) fail to understand that their system simply does not EFFECTIVELY eliminate the gross, inherently racist, overly-negative people who really don't care from their community.\n\nFor instance, there is no feedback from the report system save a message saying someone was punished based on your report.  Ok great, but what about the guy that called someone a ni**er in my last game?  I received no message about him.  What about the kid who called me gay, a retard, and a fuckwit the next game?  No feedback either.\n\nSecond, the punishments themselves have no foundation with which to fall back on.  Seems like the primary focus is business, not the community.  I say this because if you look at Riot's progressive punishment plan, it starts with a 10 game chat ban.  You can still play the game, you're just very limited in chat.  From there it moves to a 25 game chat ban, and then onto the actual suspensions.\n\nHere we see the flaw by simply viewing it in the objective sense rather than subjectively.  You get a chat ban, whoopdie-doo, you'll be back after 10 quick ARAMs to call someone else a douchewaffle or a dungbiscuit because they didn't gank when you wanted them to gank.  Same with the 25 game chat ban.  However, the real slap in the face to the generally polite comes with the permanent suspensions.  Ok so you permanently banned my account, well I'll just create another email address and make another account.  Guess what, I'm back to being a 12 year old kid daddy didn't love enough, using my superior vocabulary to torment relatively nice people while they attempt to play a game to relieve some stress.  Riot has no outlet for permanently discarding or rehabilitating the people who do not feel the need to \"clean up their act\".\n\nFurthermore, the justice is skewed.  I have experienced this personally.  I was in a game where I started 0/6, had a horrible start.  I got dogpiled on by 4 other people.  I was called retarded, gay, %%%got, worthless, piece of shit, you name it, it was there, verbatim.  FYI that's not a bad day Ulanopo, that's being a natural asshole.  So I started to defend myself.  I had begun to turn things around in game, and I can admit, I became super toxic in retaliation, and my reason is because even as I took the lead in CS and kills, they still didn't stop calling me names and flaming me.  Yes I could have muted them all, but the double standard should work in my favor as well in that THEY could have muted me.  Turns out most of my toxic teammates reported me.  I reported each one of them.  The result?  No feedback on any of them being punished, but I got a 10 game chat ban and a convenient reminder every time I logged on to clean up my behavior, to which I had to click \"I understand\".  So, objectively these 4 people were basically told it was ok to dogpile someone having a bad game and then be vindicated through this ridiculous report system when that person has had enough.  This shouldn't be the standard anywhere.\n\nThe problem is right there in Ulanopo's reply.  Triggering a review is difficult if you don't report someone.  So when 4 people pile on and report you, it triggers a review against you.  If you are the only one reporting them, it appears to do nothing.  Designed to give players some slack?  Where was my slack when you only sent me a copy of what I said in that game?  Why weren't the other 4 people who were negatively affecting gameplay in the chat text?  Was I talking to myself?  Did I click the report button for no reason?  You're not showing decent players any justice like that.  NO ONE should ever be expected to accept that type of behavior and language directed at them just because you have installed a mute function in your game and sprinkled a few conduct rules on your EULA.  I will probably get a 25 game chat ban if I ever experience that type of flaming or bullying again. \n\nIt's not perfect, and it never will be.  I suppose it must be deemed as an acceptable side effect of having a worldwide, millions+ community.  As of right now, this report system is a joke.  There is no justice, and there is no TANGIBLE consequence.  That's why most people are saying things like \"go ahead and report me\" in game.  It's like a wrist slap.  They know they can go be assholes on their smurfs.\n\nBeing in the military, I am not one to bring a complaint to the boss without having a solution or an idea to toss on the table.  As a suggestion, change one of the chat bans to a store ban, i.e. you can't buy anything (IP or RP) for 10 days if you've been a dick.  Deny RP/IP accrual.  Deny party queuing.  Put in a negative experience initiative, where you lose levels for being a toolbag.  If they are always going to be able to play through smurfs or regulated chat (aside from permanent bans), dump on their ACTUAL gameplay like they have ours.  Things like that would totally show the community you're trying to make it better.   \n\nThanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Ulanopo","date":"2016-12-19T01:26:48.664+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":">The problem is right there in Ulanopo's reply. Triggering a review is difficult if you don't report someone. So when 4 people pile on and report you, it triggers a review against you\n\nThat simply isn't true. It takes a lot more than game to trigger a review unless you do the things you mentioned your teammates doing. I would be willing to bet that they all got punished after that match. \n\nDo I think Riot could be a whole lot more transparent about behavior systems? Abso-fucking-lutely. Check out my posting history, especially on the old TBI. Half my \"job\" is poking Riot to do better, always has been.\n\nAs far as your complaints about chat bans go, you illustrate the problem perfectly with your story.\n\n> I was in a game where I started 0/6, had a horrible start.\n\n\"FeederBuster\" (the system doesn't seem to have a formal name) is the youngest and least sophisticated of the behavior systems precisely because it's difficult to differentiate a \"horrible start\" from someone who loses their lane and decides to throw to get it over more quickly. If you played old-school Arathi Basin in WoW, at least in the vanilla days on Zul'Jin, this was a huge problem (not for me, I was Horde and we won all the time).\n\nThe point is, the feeding detection system is effectively still in early beta. That's why people need to be reporting _all the feeding they see_. Chat systems got better over time. This will too.\n\n> So I started to defend myself.\n\nWhich you understand is not okay, so I'm not going to argue the point.\n\n>Why weren't the other 4 people who were negatively affecting gameplay in the chat text?\n\nBecause nothing they said justified your behavior. If you and I get into an argument in a movie theater, we're both getting kicked out.\n\n>Yes I could have muted them all, but the double standard should work in my favor as well in that THEY could have muted me.\n\nThe presence of the mute button never changes your responsibilities. To say otherwise is like me saying your ability to take a punch justifies me taking a swing at you. \n\n>Here we see the flaw by simply viewing it in the objective sense rather than subjectively. You get a chat ban, whoopdie-doo, you'll be back after 10 quick ARAMs to call someone else a douchewaffle or a dungbiscuit because they didn't gank when you wanted them to gank. Same with the 25 game chat ban.\n\nEloquently and succinctly put. It's rare to see such a clean expression of this argument and I understand your frustration. Unfortunately, you're not seeing the underlying intent and structure of the punishment system.\n\nYou see, Riot did some experimentation with punishment and found something interesting: _any_ punishment is ~50% effective the first time and loses about 50% effectiveness with each repetition, regardless of where you start, how you escalate, how many steps there are, etc. \n\nIn the days of the Tribunal, it was possible for someone to be punished 9 to 14 times before they lost their account. When they realized the nature of punishment didn't really matter, they changed two things: they reduced the number of steps to four and they engineered the first two steps so as to directly address the most common problem (This was the end result, the dreadful \"500 chat bans\" era preceded it. Lord what a cock-up.).\n\nIntentional feeding bans already skip to step 3 (14-day suspension), so I don't know how much more strict you expect them to be. It's very possible to get a feeding ban and come out of it, only to get wrecked by a behavioral ban.\n\n>Being in the military, I am not one to bring a complaint to the boss without having a solution or an idea to toss on the table.\n\nI would love to debate your suggestions in a different thread.

Sometimes, tempers are going to flare. Riot understands that. People who are aware they're being toxic and care about it almost always overestimate their toxicity. Introspection leads to observation bias.\n\nYou also cleaned up your act. Something like two-thirds of the toxicity in League comes from ordinary people simply having a bad day. The behavior systems look for persistent or highly toxic behavior. Again, someone who is thinking about what they do and how it affects other people isn't likely to be toxic enough to trigger a review. \n\nReports work.
