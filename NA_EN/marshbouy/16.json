I put my mind towards improvement at the game instead of just mindlessly playing normal games in between getting into slugfests on the boards. \r\n\r\nI got placed silver 3 (I think, it might have been 4) two or so weeks ago after finishing my placments. Within a day I was up another rank, then, another, and soon enough I was in my promos to gold. \r\n\r\nHow have I done it? \r\n\r\nLearning from my mistakes and fully applying myself to games. I have been spamming the hell out of support, lulu specifically ([73% winrate boiiiiis](http://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=Marshbouy)) and having a lot of fun doing it. \r\n\r\nMy hope is that I can get plat by the end of the season.","replies":[]}
