Take note that it doesn't in any part of it say that how it is said plays into whether it is sarcasm or not, so there is literally no reason one cannot detect it in a 6 word TYPED phrase (a 6 word phrase as you chose to say it can easily be detected because from your limitations placed on it it can be spoken, you know since we're taking things literally right?). I will refer you back to my statement above though, and remind you that plenty of people understood what it is. Maybe you should check your context clues before you go talking shit to people. I've seen you in other threads too before I ever saw you on this one so I already know that you take things way way way too seriously.
