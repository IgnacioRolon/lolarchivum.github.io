I've played him a good couple games now and the hard counter to him is strong 1v1 junglers who just invade. He does very low damage alone. I predict that once people start just walking over to either kill him or take his marked camps it's going to make him feel very weak. \n\nI lost a 1v1 to a warwick, both of us full hp, he was lv6 and I was lv8. We both used ult, and I hit the root and shield on myself every cooldown. It wasn't even close. My only option was to slow or root him and run away, which is easy to do, but then they might be taking your camps\n\nThe only truly broken thing he seems to be able to do is steal red and then gank mid at full hp, red buff, lv2, opponent is lv1. \n\nPeople won't even need to change up the usual junglers either {{champion:64}} {{champion:79}} {{champion:76}} {{champion:60}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Blue Moon Wolf","date":"2016-10-07T04:55:17.751+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He does do quite a bit of damage on his own with the help of his his bush empowered AAs and Daisy.

Honestly it does make sense to have extra health anyway since he is sacrificing health when he frees a camp.

He has a pet stronger than Tibbers. He has a damage+root on 12sec cooldown that has high scalings (+70% AP) and allows allies to dash to aa range of the rooted enemy (which is safer than if it actually dashed them to the enemy). He has a huge shield with 8 sec cooldown (!) that also explodes for AOE damage, with high scalings (80%/70% AP). And that's without even looking at all the bushes nonsense. \n\nHis shield is stronger than Janna's (higher scaling, lower cooldown), for example, and deals high aoe damage. \n\nThe Iverns I have played were pure crap and they were still a problem, it is scary to think what a player who is actually good with him can do.","replies":[]}]}
