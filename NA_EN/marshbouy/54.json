You also got very little damage done to champions, suggesting you probably just got blinded by Teemo every time you went in (as his only other real target would be Jhin, who outranges him).  You were also facing a very early damage team with a team that had built almost no damage at all - Compare Jhin's BFS/Pick and your Warrior enchant as your team's only damage items to the fact every single enemy had at least one major damage item.\n\n2)  Looks like your bot lane had a real bad day.  I'm guessing that's because Kassadin got to roam like crazy (as that's what Kassadin does) and ganked them continuously once he hit 6, getting himself and Ezreal fed.  He moves a lot faster than Yasuo.  I can't give you advice on how to play Rengar in that situation, but it looks to me that nobody suppressed Kassadin and stopped him from roaming, which let him do what Kassadin does.","replies":[{"poster":"Marshbouy","date":"2016-04-27T19:48:24.908+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You make sense.

We just got fucking destroyed and there wasn't any reason for it. I'm not sure if it was skill, champion picks, or what, this has been happening a lot.\n\nThis strongly suggests you're not 'playing to improve'. The concept of playing to improve involves analyzing your situation, what you did correctly and incorrectly at given moments in the game. For example, if you fed first blood as a mid laner you can ask yourself \"okay, what happened here?\". \"Gragas walked into our Raptors at lvl 4 and flash-slammed me, ensuring the enemy has a kill.\"\n\nThen you can think about ways to prevent this, such as keeping tabs on the enemy jungler, not pushing all the way to your opponents turret when a gank is plausible, having your side lanes warded (and not just the side bush, there are 6 entrances to mid lane). This is simply an example, since I don't even know if you're a mid-laner. The point remains that most situations can be analyzed for optimal play (such as who is fed on the enemy team? Maybe I should itemize against that person?).\n\ntl:dr: If you don't know why you lost, the first step to improving is getting a bead on why you lost.","replies":[{"poster":"Marshbouy","date":"2016-04-27T01:17:51.139+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i spent 5 minutes staring at the graphs and wondering why we lost.
