Is it just hate from \"Forum only\" player? (personnaly I go on both :p)\r\n\r\nI don't know if I'll get and anserw (even if I hope so^^) but it's stil better to ask than do nothing and keep thinking about it^^","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Stashu","date":"2014-09-10T18:44:23.111+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"Hey Flemman! I think you're 100% correct here, and my Cassiopeia post really should have been on boards. I'm still super new to forums/boards posting, but I should have checked to see which would have been the better platform for this sort of discussion. I'm really sorry about that =[, and I'll keep this in mind in the future.","replies":[{"poster":"Canastus","date":"2014-09-14T14:55:54.783+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"**I hope you still follow the discussion in the thread despite your departure**, I don't think anyone could muster the strength to read over 100 pages of feedback once they've returned. I realize it'd be even harder to reply to all of those posts but please read them. \n\n[There's one post from the user 'Aviladel' which I'd like to highlight.](http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?p=49917239#post49917239) I think you'll find it to be very insightful. Cassiopeia relied so much on her ability to harass and poke that it became her main source of damage, this rework pretty much shifted the focus to an ability which is **incredibly risky and rather impractical** to use since it renders you entirely immobile.\n\nThe risk/reward-ratio is absolutely skewed to her disadvantage now. **In the end she deals less total damage to champions than before**, just because her gameplay has become entirely onesided and situational.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Daen","date":"2014-09-10T21:36:27.813+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Appreciate you addressing this, Stashu!\n\nI don't necessarily think there is a \"correct\" forum on which to post official things, but the Boards tends to be where many of those types of threads have been recently.  That being said, extra traffic on the Boards is always interesting since we're a reasonably small community.  Plus, it can be a bit easier to quickly see what is most relevant in the conversation on the Boards rather than GD.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Flemman","date":"2014-09-16T16:27:43.383+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, thanks for the reply (even if you still express yourself only on NA forum >-< )\n\nGuess I'll be stuck in the \"reading the discussion only\" for this rework :p","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"genexp","date":"2014-09-11T16:08:06.340+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Helpful!","replies":[]}]}
