I had around 100-200 FPS two days ago, but today and yesterday I get 30, and 10 in teamfights. Has anyone else experienced these drops? I'm thinking it has to do with the project minions, but im not sure. Thanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-05T16:48:25.935+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A drop in FPS can happen for a few reasons like corrupt game files, hardware problems, or even outdated drivers.
