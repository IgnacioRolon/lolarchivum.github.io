Im thinking of picking up Elise to try her out top, plus i figure shes a good jungler if mastered and the meta favors her. I tried elise when i was a bit inexperienced and lower level, but never really liked her. Now i have some more experience, i think i could probably play her a bit better. Im just wondering some of your thoughts on Elise top, and if you could suggest me some other off meta top laners to play, itd be greatly appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"Kapppaccino","date":"2016-04-26T21:39:29.693+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Elise top is good if you can abuse level 2, or can wait til you have 2 or 3 items. I used to play elise top but shes too reliant on snowballing. Id recommend jayce top. Hes extremely fun and has sooooo many build options. He runs oom if you spam spells, but i like rushing IE and playing him like an adc. I also like yasuo, swain, annie, and zyra top. They can deny bruisers super easily and snowball if they can get a kill.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pandemic Punch","date":"2016-04-26T21:13:24.644+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:74}}  Works in MANY matchups and is excellent vs ganks.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AttackOnTeemos","date":"2016-04-26T20:59:40.179+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Soraka.","replies":[]}]}
