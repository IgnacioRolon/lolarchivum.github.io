It's still an issue. Two times all rune pages deleted on my main. One time today on a smurf. One time every single skin on my main was deselected I have over 100 skins on that account. I know back in team builder you couldn't use team builder because it ruined your skin selection so I stopped using it. Now however you can't even play arams or ranked without it randomly happening. I am not 100% sure but it seems like your summoner spells are also reset to default sometimes when this happens. It didn't look like it happened today though but I am fairly sure it happened last time.\n\nPlease fix this! It's more than a minor inconvenience when you have 20 rune pages and spent hours researching optimal runes for a variety of champions.\n\nI am not posting from the account it happened on in case you actually care about fixing this.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot BlueMonday","date":"2019-12-07T21:24:42.940+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not sure if this is related but we were having issues with the service that stores settings.
