I have my quick cast with indicator set to shift q-w-e-r and quick cast set to q-w-e-r. When i used indicator about a week ago and before then, i used to be able to right click and stop the ability, but now it won't stop the indicator and i am forced to use the spell before i can use anything, even move. Keep in mind i have not changed any of my hotkeys within a month besides space and s for auto attack click so i can kite. \r\nI've reset my hotkeys twice and before changing them back to my normal setting's I've tried to ping my abilities and stop an ability while indicator but it still won't work, did i accidentally click on a setting?\r\n\r\nSummary:     Ever since the ping cool downs update came out I've been able to ping it but just a few days ago i haven't been able to. I also can't stop an ability while in the indicator by right clicking. \r\nMaybe make a hotkey so i can set alt+mb1 on an ability to ping it in chat? Also i would appreciate knowing how to make it so i can cancel an ability while it's indicator is active.

We may need to reset those keybindings again if nothing seems to work at all.","replies":[{"poster":"GiltTrace","date":"2017-10-20T10:57:57.618+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"doesn't work :/","replies":[]}]}]}
