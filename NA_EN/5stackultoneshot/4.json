She rushes CDR on top of the 5% she gets from Inspiration. Her kit is too net positive in damage for early game that a good Riven player doesn't even worry about her cooldowns. All it means is she's gonna be passive till 6, by then she would have at least two cdr components. \n\nWith the 5% alone, the E will be at a 13.3 second cooldown, much lower than Sylas' two part dash which sits at a whopping 18 seconds. And since she has animation canceling as a part of her kit, its only fair the passive gets hit since that allows her to get her passive hits off much easier and in quicker succession. \n\nRight now its 25% of her AD, and she can easily hit 90-100 AD like I said, so that gives her 80-90 damage from the auto itself, and a extra 22.5 (round down since armor exists to 22) bonus physical damage on that auto. Thats nuts early game, and thats just one auto out of 3 autos animation canceling can give her. All im saying is, her scalings right now outweigh her negatives for those respective spells, which makes her weaknesses less stronger.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"SuperTopLFBottom","date":"2019-05-02T00:27:24.949+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Abibyama II,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=liJNOws8,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2019-05-01T11:33:48.905+0000)\n>\n> Making her rank 5 E CD the same as current rank 1 E is a big nerf \n> \n> But it doesn't matter since this place hates compensation buff for champions with a dash and would rather them being deleted from the game :)\n\nOr maybe people are just sick and tired of riots favorites getting compensation buffs non stop because riot doesnt actually want to nerf them, but have to because of community complaints, because as i said they are their favorites while they have no problem to just give jax straight nerfs and be done with it. Or giving heca a 40 fuckin base dmg nerf on E and halfing his Q stack dmg in just one patch. There is no well -5 base dmg on E and compensation buff his Q to like 50% stack dmg hehehehehe. \n\n\nRiven is a broken champion who is now also very overpowered so the correct solution is to nerf her and be done with it. You can still buff her if the very unlikely event of her being too weak happens.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GodlyBane","date":"2019-05-02T14:23:53.384+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Abibyama II,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=liJNOws8,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2019-05-01T11:33:48.905+0000)\n>\n> Making her rank 5 E CD the same as current rank 1 E is a big nerf \n> \n> But it doesn't matter since this place hates compensation buff for champions with a dash and would rather them being deleted from the game :)\n\nHer rank 5 vs rank 5 on E is this: 3.5s cd current patch, 5.5 second cd next patch.
