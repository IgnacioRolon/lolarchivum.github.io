Sorry, not buying it.\n\nAnd this is the first I've even heard about 'Deus Vult' being used in game.  I've seen 'Allahu Akbar' a few times and heard about more.\n\nAlso, in recognizing Latin is rare outside science, medicine, and *most* Churches, it's actually not uncommon to hear translated versions such as 'God willing'. In modern usage, I don't think I've ever heard as a battlecry or call for violence.\n\nArabic, on the other hand, is an active language, so more people are aware of how it is being used now. And enough people *have* heard 'Allahu Akbar' used by terrorists to be wary.\n\nFinally, I have heard nothing about the 'alt right' using Deus Vult.  And considering a left of center Youtuber I watch has been accused of being 'alt right'... I'm more than a little skeptical of that claim.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kelg","date":"2019-01-30T16:09:25.590+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"probably not\nit means something like \"God wills it\" ","replies":[]},{"poster":"Xidphel","date":"2019-01-30T12:38:19.448+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Doubt it.","replies":[]}]}
