I'm saying that while Yasuo probably shouldn't be rewarded as much for building Lifesteal (especially the AoE Q interaction), Yasuo is by no means the only offender of having too much healing, if that is in fact a problem. Furthermore, there are simple ways to counter builds like this, and if you aren't utilizing them properly, then that's your fault, not the game designers'. The game designers, if anything, are probably going to nerf the Q interaction first, as you suggested. Then, they'll look into Bramble Vest to see if it's a hard enough counter to builds like this. If it isn't, then they'll either buff grievous Wounds or nerf Lifesteal in general. If Yasuo is still too effective with Lifesteal after that, then he'll get a larger dose of the nerf bat in terms of interaction with Lifesteal.\n\nEDIT: clarified my statement on healing on other champions","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Doopliss7","date":"2019-04-05T09:45:01.400+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"build a bramble vest or executioners calling you big baby {{item:3076}} {{item:3123}}","replies":[{"poster":"5StackUltOneShot","date":"2019-04-05T10:33:16.544+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Doopliss7,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Wxx19A2O,comment-id=000b,timestamp=2019-04-05T09:45:01.400+0000)\n>\n> build a bramble vest or executioners calling you big baby {{item:3076}} {{item:3123}}\n\nImagine insulting someone online cause your social anxiety doesnt come out over the internet","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Janakin","date":"2019-03-30T12:34:19.987+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":7,"body":"All these please crying about {{champion:157}} being OP should try to play a few dozen games with him on a non-monkey elo.
