Reason being was this game is honeslty infuriating. Not because of anyone is particular but the champions are aids\r\n\r\nBeing a toplane main and going vs Fiora, Riven, Tryndamere, Darius, Irelia, Jax, Akali, Aatrox, Urgot, Kled, Pantheon and Renekton. All there bullshit ways of killing and surviving honeslty take a toll. It feels like skill doesnt even matter. Nothing feels worse than beating a Trynda into 2/5 only to have him beat you down behind a tower by clicking R. Maining immobile champions and going vs the likes of Irelia and Riven who just dance around you while out damaging and sustaining you. It feels so bad to play this game, Im happy im banned because I really was addicted.\r\n\r\n Every patch I just hoped for some damage nerfs, for a chance to express skill. For a chance of longer and more chilled games. A game where if I die once it does not mean Irelia can start one shotting me with sheen or Tynrda starts 3 hitting me with Zeal or Renekton who just kills you once he reaches lvl 3.\r\n\r\nPeople are so toxic aswell that it begins to rub off on you. Its just a self destructive game. I had my fun with {{champion:122}}, I met some nice people and did some nice plays but beyond that, this is goodbye.\r\n\r\nQuick Summary, Game 1 was vs Tryndamere, 2 lucky crits I got tilted flamed game design\r\n\r\nGame 2, Diana went 0/9 (made a post about this) and I light flamed her for not ganking and for flaming us not herself,\r\n\r\nGame 3, Irelia and Lee sin premades mindlessly tower diving me while maintaining higher farm and drake control meanwhile my Khazix flames me for feeding.\r\n\r\nBye.\r\n\r\n(Time to try Apex Legends)","replies":[{"poster":"Bagzy21","date":"2019-03-04T01:48:18.178+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just have to say thet i think thet League of Legends is not doing a single thing od baneing players for the verbal abuse, i came a cross multible players thet have cursed my mother and after the match i report the right and they are not getting bans at all this is not ok, and the latest player thet used this kind of langueg was DoKu1923 and i have reported him corretlly they evan use other langueges but in some of them you can under stand the word MOTHER, League of Legends, BAN this player DoKu1923 take away his account, because i know thet im not the only one thet hade a verbal abuse problem with him and he ruend the game for me","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tele II","date":"2019-03-01T01:19:07.057+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Good for you.

Just not enough players? Just wondering... not trying to \"catch\" you or anything lol. I started with dota 2, and I cant even remember why we moved to league. I think it was the fact league didnt let you deny creeps so we were like hmm that sounds a bit more basic and we suck so maybe try league?

In four years I think there were two new champion releases. The armadillo and the Wisp thing. But there was never anything new.\n\nIf you wanted new stuff you had to buy the compendium which I didnt have 100's of dollars to continuously buy loot boxes.\n\nI think thats the only reason really, if Dota2 brought in new hero's or reworks every once in a while I would have stayed, I tried to get back into it but after playing league for so long the difficulty difference is actually insane.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"kingDeDeDarius","date":"2019-03-01T04:59:38.491+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel ya man","replies":[]},{"poster":"Starmfangy","date":"2019-03-01T01:07:28.055+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Hey what percentage of people are currently permabanned right now?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Galaxyburstz","date":"2019-03-01T02:17:00.088+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"I'll help with the move\n\nhttps://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends?utm_campaign=APXL_HD_CA_GAM_SRCH_GGL_Generic-E&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_term=apex+legends&amp;&amp;\n\nI hate to do this but...but....but...bye....\n\n{{sticker:sg-janna}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Guivanni","date":"2019-03-01T06:18:19.557+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"The way league of legends handles their chat restrictions or bans is complete bullshit...
