It puts a vast majority of champions at such a massive disadvantage that it's almost and unfair skill in of itself.\n\nAlso he needs to either do burst damage or sustain damage not fucking both, this is the issue we currently have with Vayne.

Some of them fall off, others have issues during teamfights.\n5. and Varus' W was nerfed and given an active for being too strong as an on-hit, let's not forget that apart from Udyr and maybe Vi, all those champions you mentioned have skillshots, no dashes either.

Except, aatrox didn't have an AA-reset &amp; he didnt get free stats on his R. Old Aatrox &amp; Jax have similar play paterns, with the difference old aatrox had 2 skillshots, while jax has none. And jax has autoattack immunity that gives 25% aoe damage reduction. And an ultimate that gives him armor &amp; MR. And a free attack speed steroid (OH, LOOK JUST LIKE OLD AATROX, WHAT?!?!).\n\nJax is a stat check. \nHe is literaly same as old Aatrox, except Aatrox had insane healing, while jax has the ability to dodge attacks &amp; free armor/mr on his R.

The dodge/stun is a windowed defense that you can bait and play around, while passive lifesteal/healing is simply always on, and either you have enough to survive or you don't.\n\nCan Jax fight you from behind, while you have a lead, and outplay you? Could old Aatrox do the same? If yes, that means this champ is not stat-check because they don't rely on simply having more stats to beat you.

Wow, so interactive.\n> \n> Jax is the epitome of a stat check, if he isn't one, who is?\n\nAatrox shouldn’t have gotten a complete rework before Jax either. Let’s compare old Aatrox to Jax:\n\n     1. His only hard CC was an easily avoidable knockup, you could even prevent the knock up from casting if you cc him before he started his descent on his Q.\n     2. None of Aatrox’s abilities make any enemy unable to fight him except for his Q. Maybe they can’t stay in battle for long, but they had a chance to escape. They even had items that could help them massivley; Bramble Vest/Thornmail, Morellonomicon, Executioner’s Culling, etc.\n     3. W, admittedly, needed to be replaced somehow. \n     4. Aatrox’s jump is his main engage tool as well as his only escape tool, with ~15 second cooldown. If he uses it, he gets put at a disadvantage either escaping or going in.\n     5. As was his R. Both his W and R were highly uninteractive to the enemy and unavoidable without being far from Aatrox, and essentially just boosted Aatrox via stats (AD, Attack Speed, Lifesteal, AA Range)\n     6. Aatrox’s passive, at least the original, took much longer to charge up than Jax’s. It also allowed him to revive himself once every 5 minutes, the only problem is that usually he is stuck in a very vulnerable place.\n\nSo why did they rework Aatrox before Jax? He was placed #4 or 5 in community want to rework, but why exactly?\n\n     1. His passive gave him attack speed and the ability to revive based on how full his Bloodwell was. Problems: His revive left him in very vulnerable spots, AA-based champs fallen out of favor. Blooodwell was hard to fill/manage. (Debatable) Solution: Rework Bloodwell to be a set of 5 stacks. Remove the passive and place a part of it on his R. Slow movement allowed while reviving. Reception: Wide in both directions. Poor-confused, revive only on R seems out of place.\n     2. His Q made him dash into the air and land in an area, the center of which would knock people up. Problems: Able to be knocked out of Q at any time. Solutions: Make him Unstoppable during the landing phase. Replaced with 3 slashes of a sword which may knock up targets in a small area. Reception: Resentful, too similar to Riven’s play style for many, dulls the essence of the character’s origins for some.\n      3. His W allowed him to either heal or deal more damage every 3 auto-attacks, able to change at any time. Problems: Auto-Attack champs have fallen out of favor. Damage/Heal ratios too low or too high. (Debatable) Solution: Replaced with a skillshot that drags a target back and damaged them if they do not escape a small area within a small time. Reception: Irritated, some dislike the area’s design, others believe it dulls the essence of the character’s origins, but not wholly disliked.\n     4. His E shot two skillshots that combined at the end, dealing damaged to enemies and slowing them for a moderate amount. Problems: Strange hitbox shape. (Debatable) Solution: Replaced with a double dash that doesn’t interrupt some abilities and a passive healing. Double dash reduced to one. Reception: Irritated at more mobility in game. Irritated that the second dash is removed.\n     5. His R dealt damage to all enemy champs in a small area and gave him increased attack speed, range, and damage. Also filled up Bloodwell based on enemy champs damaged. (?) Problem: Overloaded him with stats and instant-cast, AA-based champs fallen out of favor. (Debatable). Solution: Replaced with an ability that allows Aatrox to access his old passive, and boosts some of his stats. Correction: Allows him to access a non-replenishing, non-boosting Bloodwell with a better revive, boosts his damage instead of his attack speed, and gets shiny visuals. Reception: No notable push in positive or negative opinions have been found.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Marshbouy","date":"2019-03-05T15:59:00.692+0000","up_votes":28,"down_votes":5,"body":"jax is literally one of the most statchecky champions in the game.
