It's really important that for not you stick to custom games to troubleshoot, and not queue up for matchmade games until you know the issue's been resolved.  \n\nThat said, I'd love to help but need more info.  When you say client crashes, what does that mean exactly?  Are there any error messages?  What are you seeing?","replies":[{"poster":"WatchTheShadows","date":"2017-06-13T17:55:52.092+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi, ive never done this b4 so didnt actually think anyone would answer but when im in champ select the game will freeze or crash and kick me from the lobby. i would not be upset with this if thats all it did but it will also give me a timer so i cant play another game until its gone. I would like it fixed because im not the one thats leaving. The game is kicking from the lobby when it freezes/crashes. Some errors i got were like... \"unable to select champion\" \"unable to select spells\" or it wouldnt say anything and just exit the lobby","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-06-13T18:02:17.412+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the info here, and I'm happy to help!  In this case, start off by disabling [low spec mode](https://i.gyazo.com/a39e12ca76e54359342203c476a0e9c1.png) mode, in case your PC might be going through too much stress during champion select by disabling the fancy aesthetics.\n\nShould the issue continue, then your connection in champion select could be unstable, causing you to lose sync and get left behind.  You'll want to go through every step of the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to troubleshoot that.\n\nKeep in mind, it's really important that you test this out in custom games for now, until you're absolutely sure you can return to a matchmade queue.
