But that&#039;s not what i&#039;m here to write about. I want to know what exactly happens when somebody reports another player for verbal abuse, unsportsmanlike, or offensive language. Because some of the games that I got chat restricted for, I had 100% a right to flame back at the person. They were extremely rude to me first, and I defend myself, and they keep triggering me, and we get into an argument, but does Rito actually even check the chat logs of the other player? Because it seems to me that they literally look at your chat log and all they see is:\r\n\r\nMaster of Sirens: shut up idiot\r\nMaster of Sirens: you&#039;ve done literally nothing for the team, you&#039;re 0-4\r\nMaster of Sirens: you&#039;re worthless\r\nMaster of Sirens: gg report anivia verbal abuse\r\n\r\nWheras what really happens is more along the lines of:\r\n\r\nxxSpamBoixx: you&#039;re f**** trash go kys\r\nMaster of Sirens: shut up idiot\r\nxxSpamBoixx: you pathetic degenerate you are throwing the game, you piece of trash\r\nMaster of Sirens: you&#039;ve done literally nothing for the team, you&#039;re 0-4\r\nxxSpamBoixx: dude you are honestly trash just afk pls\r\nMaster of Sirens: you&#039;re worthless\r\nxxSpamBoixx: go kys f*ggot\r\nMaster of Sirens: gg report anivia verbal abuse pls\r\n\r\nWhen you read the first chat log, it seems like i&#039;m the jerk, and it also seems to me that that is all the Rito employees read when you get reported. I think that they should actually go and read THE WHOLE GAME&#039;S CHAT LOG rather than just your own.\r\nAfter one game, during which I had an extremely racist team mate, I got chat restricted. Now this racist team mate was not just sort of racist with a couple rude comments every once in a while, this guy is by far the most racist player I have ever played with. If you did a single thing wrong, then you were a Jew, a Mexican, a Hispanic person, a Chinese person, a Canadian, it did&#039;t matter. Now, I was mad at this guy and raging him, I reported him after the game, and......... literally nothing happened. I got chat restricted. He was 100% fine. How does that work? I&#039;m less offensive than him, and I get a chat restriction, yet he gets nothing. Please read all the chat logs when somebody gets reported, not just the one players.\r\n\r\n\r\nP.s. I&#039;m ticked right now because as I said in the beginning I just got perma banned for chat, rather than chat banned. Logic, right? But anyways, I&#039;m not going to proof read this or anything and idc if it has bad grammar and is out of order. Also idc about the people down in the comments going &quot;you deserve to be banned you nasty pig,&quot; &quot;dude you&#039;re pathetic, if you would just not be toxic, then u wouldn&#039;t get chat restricted and have to deal with this&quot;\r\n\r\n\r\nI&#039;m done typing now.","replies":[{"poster":"Lsayu","date":"2016-10-21T07:24:48.832+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":">I had 100% a right to flame back at the person\n\nNo, no, no and no. What someone says does not open an opportunity for you to be toxic as well without punishment, otherwise it will be a web of oh but he said, no she said, but then he said and she said, and then he said, but she then said. No. Just report the person, there are people out there .... challenged with the concept of humane behavior but you still shouldn't take it out on the rest of your team mates.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Its LiuKang","date":"2016-10-21T07:14:39.379+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot has stating multiple times that responding to negative comments with more negative comments is unacceptable and can lead to punishments.

In your example both players would be punished. Instead of flaming back mute, report, and move on with your life.\n\nRiot doesn't do permenant chat bans because after testing a similar feature they found that most people with it on their accounts resorted to other means of toxicity, such as intentional feeding.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CrazyBear1987","date":"2016-10-21T06:10:16.941+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Master of Sirens,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=EBUiP2U4,comment-id=,timestamp=2016-10-21T05:52:20.527+0000)\n>\n> Master of Sirens: shut up idiot\n> Master of Sirens: you&amp;#039;ve done literally nothing for the team, you&amp;#039;re 0-4\n> Master of Sirens: you&amp;#039;re worthless\n> Master of Sirens: gg report anivia verbal abuse\n\nNegative behavior and threatening to report are enough to give you what you got. especially with your history of ban already","replies":[]}]}
