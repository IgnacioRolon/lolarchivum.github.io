Restarted Client to 'older version'","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"I log in to League of Legends(Admin just incase) And it tells me \n\"We have restored this installation to an older version of League of Legends. Now we'll try to patch it up to the latest version\" \nI then click \"OKAY\" then...\n\"There was a problem patching league of legends, we'll restore a backup version and try updating again after you restart the patcher\" \nThen I click \"RESTART\" then it STARTS OVER and keeps going back more and more patch login screens!!\n\nAlso I did check my internet connection, everything is in order. I've updated Java and anything else I could possibly think of...\nAlso YES i did disable my antispam and malware and firewall temporarily but that didnt do anything either. \n\nI assume it must deal with the new arcade boss thing, i was playing for hours yesterday just fine with the same exact patch already updated. \n\nOFF TOPIC Side note: Riot needs to slow down on making skins and new champs. I invited a friend to play and he refused because 'there is to much to know'. Which i can see where he is coming from. I've had years of knowledge and followed every patch update so I'm all set but its hard to learn hundreds of champs and skins and skillsets and items. Please just slow down a little bit... Let people enjoy the new stuff you have made for a few months before moving on.
