These sometimes even get me Queue penalties!\n\nThoughts?\n\n-Onwodori\n\nUPDATE - I have received a 5 game penalty because of this.\n\nhttps://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p526x296/14906883_1787027994918673_6753445440334090359_n.jpg?oh=ac9f93eed7afe65e206ea31ffe435fcc&amp;oe=58CF51BB\n\nCould I please have this reverted? This really, really isn't my fault and I hate that I get punished for it so frequently.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-01T23:38:42.358+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"[Leaverbuster](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ) penalties are not something that can be manually removed.
