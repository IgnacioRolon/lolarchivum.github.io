On my apparently perpetual quest for a champion to main and a main to champion (Yes, that makes sense both directions -- English Major) I have boiled down a few things to certainties:\r\n\r\n1 - I main the Jungle and Support\r\n2 - I like tanks or champions with MAD escape skills\r\n3 - ~~I am a hipster~~ I like champions that are rarely picked so I can main them uninterrupted\r\n\r\nFrom all this, names like Galio, Yorick and Zac all come to mind, though that middle one is getting a hefty rebuild, apparently.\r\n\r\nNot exactly sure what I am in need of help with, but perhaps I would like some info on how these champions operate and if they would be feasible in the positions of support and jungle.\r\n\r\nMany thanks and may your cup spillith over,\r\n\r\n-MF","replies":[{"poster":"BruisingEmu","date":"2014-11-12T12:14:07.789+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Try Skarner jungle.\nI used to play Maokai support once in a while. Keep the saplings at level one. Just use them as ward relief if you're out of wards and have to stay.\nUse Runes and Masteries for a ton of armor and build relic shield. You can get away with leaping on their adc quite often and just healing it back with shield and passive. The initiate is pretty strong and zones them well.
