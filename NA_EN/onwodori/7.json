So my old computer crashed and I'm trying to play League on this little machine now, only when I get to queue into a game, the client pulls out back to the main menu, citing that there is a problem with the listed (function?

You did something to your DirectX 9 (DX9) installation, and now a .dll file, which is mandatory, is missing. I suggest first trying to reinstall that specific missing file, however last time I had a DX9 error I had to format and reset my entire hard drive, reinstall windows, etc... it's a pain, but you can hardly play ANY games without DX9, so I'd recommend doing the easier and less likely options first. Look for a DX9 installer first, and if that doesn't work then try installing the specific files from specific downloads..","replies":[{"poster":"Onwodori","date":"2016-11-28T18:27:24.624+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Duckeroo,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=AWHlfKrY,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-11-28T04:57:59.117+0000)\n>\n> Well, it kinda means you&#x27;re fucked.

I really hope this works, because, at some point down the troubleshooting track, an OS reinstall is necessary, as *Duckeroo* mentioned.\n\nLet me know if this worked!","replies":[]}]}]}]}
