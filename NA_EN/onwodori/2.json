Once again, due to the frequent hit or miss quality of internet here, I've been leavebustered after two or so 'AFK'ed games when I didn't load in in time and an early game restart was used. It really isn't fair - I'm not toxic what so ever and there needs to be an additional layer of complexity to leave buster OR they should be appeal-able.\r\n\r\n-Onwodori","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-30T01:47:57.169+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It really doesn't seem fair for some players to end up getting stuck with an LPQ due to a faulty internet connection, but it'd be even more unfair for games to be ruined due to those connection issues and no one ever have penalties associated with them. Essentially, one player's iffy connection can ruin the entire match for 9 other people which doesn't feel too good either.\n\nIt's always good to make sure your connection is in tip top shape, and if you know yours is prone to these issues you can use the [**Lag Report Tool**](https://lagreport.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/) to see about how your connection fares before hopping into games. I'd also suggest hitting up the [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) for some basic troubleshooting, but do pay extra attention to the steps on Port Forwarding and DNS settings.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AZ Frost","date":"2017-10-30T01:25:23.683+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I've been screwed a few times from this issue.
