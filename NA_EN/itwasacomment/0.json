I live in AZ, and I have a consistent 90 ping. I have run some speed tests, used the hextech repair tool and checked with others in this area. And it seems that is not what I should have. I was wondering if I could get some assistance here. If anybody is able to help out and tell me what info they need from me (Logs and such) it would be much appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-02T02:08:07.492+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Let's try some quick and easy basic steps first! I'd like to have you check out the [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues), specifically for the steps on **Port Forwarding and DNS**. Those two options together can make it a lot easier for your network to reach our servers, so try those changes out in a custom or practice game really quickly.\n\nIf that doesn't help much, feel free to hit me back up and we can dig a little deeper into this ^_^.","replies":[{"poster":"ItWasAComment","date":"2017-11-03T01:02:53.897+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did not work my friend...

Go ahead and grab some of your logs, specifically network logs, and shoot those over to our tech guys in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new). They should be able to sift through those to see what else might be causing issues.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
