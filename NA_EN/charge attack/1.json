If we're talking about immobile champions being worse than mobile champions then yes. Speed ups are mobility. Just because it's not a straight up dash or blink doesn't mean it isn't mobility.\n\nAs long as we're talking mobile vs immobile we count champions with no mobility spell (like a speed up, dash or blink) against champions with mobility (aka champions that have a speed up, dash or blink).\n\nNow here's the deal. If we're talking about the NORM then yes, speed ups could be considered weak enough compared to a dash or blink to be put into the immobile section. We're not talking about the norm though. We're talking mobile vs immobile and that means champions with no mobility spell at all vs the rest.\n\nEdited for clarification: Another thing we have to concider is what kind of dash/blink does a champion have? If it's only on an ult I'd concider that champion immobile because that one mobility spell is gated by a long ass cooldown most of the time.

Slight if anything.\n\nAltho we really need a definition because at absurd levels it definitely qualifies. (Cough jhin cough)  IMHO a champion is mobile if they have low CD target agnostic dashes. (target refuring to enemy champions, soas to include yasuo) and typically for them to be classified as mobile they should be adept at moving around the battlefield to evade death, as well as escape or engage. (riven, yasuo {only because of how fucking many he has in a fight rather then effective escapes} Camille, Fiora, tryndemere and so on) whereas Leona and alistar, while having mobility to engage, it's very limited in what it can do.

Because everyone has a different definition. I base mine on how the champion feels to play and to play against.

Let's be brutally blunt for a moment.  The VAST majority of league players are \"low elo\", as such, I'd say at LEAST 80% of players are not using ANY champ to its maximum potential.  But let's say in 100 games, 20 of them have a Yasuo and 5 of them have a Lux.  If we assume that 20% of players playing a champ (made up percentage, but not important to the point) will play at a high skill level, then I'm going to see 4 badass Yasuos vs. 1 Lux.  Ie. I get killed more often by high mobility champions if taken purely as a flat \"number of games/plays\", even though statistically it may be essentially the same BY PERCENTAGE.\n\nAlso, as others have already noted, popularity definitely skews the skill situation.  Aurelion Soll is LITERALLY only played by ONE person in the entire NA LCS (in actual pro matches) but is banned against that guy (and ONLY that guy, literally NO ONE else) because he's the ONLY guy that does it.  When a champion is \"weak\", the only people that really play them competitively truly love the champion and thus will (more often than not) have a MUCH higher level of familiarity with the champ.  In extreme cases, I can totally believe there are players that are \"gold\" on their one trick that would be bronze on ANY other champion (regardless of lane).","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"BlinkZZ182","date":"2018-10-10T21:55:27.012+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Some mobile champions suck.

That's 8 / 21. LOL? Even in that \"list of immobiles at the bottom\" it's circa 8 / 21 for immobiles If we are being generous.\n\nRegardless of whether mobile champs sacrifice something or not, I am not sure If you are willing to ignore large MS boost as mobility tool just to prove your point. I suppose Jhin is also extremly immobile like Xerath lmao.\n\nThe problem is that If you have slow, delayed, counterable skillshot that you depend on, it's easy for mobile champion to dodge it and fuck up your entire combo while they have free real estate. How do we solve it? By making mobility balanced? Nope we also break Mages to oneshot you in one rotation so you are rewarded by hitting one thing coz that's fun. They buffed Vel'Koz Q AP ratio just so that he would be over-rewarded from one skillshot he chains combo from. And so a balanced champ can go into broken boys club.\n\nThis arms race is what gave us both Zoe and Irelia. I am not going to find that acceptable, sorry.\n\nAlso you provided no context to your staistic. So yes I am going to ignore it.

You have to remember ahri just received a Nerf, but before this she was running mid lane with a high win rate so if you look at the most popular champions who were mid lane then you have this. Obviously 50% of games before had these champions mid late and since Ahri was winning the other lanes were losing thus making some win rates iare still adjusting and it will take some time see below.\n\nAhri Mid 11.8% Pick Rate 52.9% Win Rate\nYasuo Mid 12.5% Pick Rate 50.1% Win Rate\nZed Mid 11.8% Pick Rate 49.2% Win Rate\nTalon Mid 5.0% Pick Rate 48.7% Win Rate\nIrelia Mid 5.6% Pick Rate 50.1% Win Rate\n11.8 + 12.5 + 11.8 + 5 + 5.6 this is 46-47% of the games have these 5 champs. Excluding Talon and Irelia 35% of games will have Ahri, Zed, or Yasuo. meaning that if Ahri is winning more games they are obviously losing more. So until Ahri is put into a good spot these champs will continue to Ahri making their win rates worse. Anyway this post is mis leading as there are not enough AD mids.\n\nNow if you do a search on League Of Graphs for plat+ mid lane this is the top 20 win rates\nhttps://www.leagueofgraphs.com/champions/stats/middle/platinum/by-winrate\n\n1.Aurelion Sol - Mobility\n2. Zilean - Mobility\n3. Talon - Mobility\n4. Heimerdinger - immobile\n5. Katarina - Mobility\n6. Kayle - immobileish\n7. Ahri - Mobility\n8. Annie - Immobile\n9. Swain - Immobile\n10. Malzahar - Immobile\n11. Twisted Fate - Immobile\n12. Anivia - Immobile\n13. Ekko - Mobility\n14. Vel'Koz - Immobile\n15. Fizz - Mobility\n16. Brand - Immobile\n17. Cassiopeia - Immobileish\n18. LeBlanc - Mobility\n19. Lissandra - Mobility\n20. Lux - Immobile\n\nLooking at this 4 of the top 5 are mobile, and Heimer is immobile but since he is just a really strong laner and pusher I am gonna say its not a big deal for him.
