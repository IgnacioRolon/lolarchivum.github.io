Why? Because every time crit items become viable for ADCs, they become broken on Yasuo. Once again the second crit items get buffed yasuo spikes in win rate and will probably become busted again soon. \r\n\r\nThe problem with crit items is that until you get IE + zeal item, your items are pretty much worthless. Also you probably need another crit item if you wanna start dealing damage. However as we all know Yasuo spikes hard with just PD because of his passive, and spikes EVEN harder with IE. Crit items have to be garbage early/mid because otherwise Yasuo becomes a monster way too quick. \r\n\r\nADCs have pretty much been forced to build lethality/BoRK because those are items that aren&#039;t balanced around a fking DOUBLE CRIT PASSIVE. Like yeah you can be relevant early/mid game with crit items IF YOU GET DOUBLE CRIT, but ADCs don&#039;t and HAVE TO find a way to be relevant in another way. \r\n\r\nAll I&#039;m saying is this: Don&#039;t balance crit items around yasuo and instead balance yasuo around his crit passive (because they&#039;re obviously not gonna change that).

Too good. But they SHOULDN&#x27;T be buying them gameplay-wise because of balancing issues, and gameplay health. Because it&#x27;s a pain to play against, and that&#x27;s why Riot does their best to discourage it. People still buy tank on skirmishers, because it&#x27;s just THAT good on them. \n\nThe only sure way to prevent that, would be disabling tank items from being built altogether on those champions.\n\nThere were countless cases where a champion disregarded Riot's \"intended\" builds and roles.\nThe community decides that.\n\n> I&#x27;m not saying tank skirmishers are bad builds, but that they are bad for the game.\n\nThey are a necessity for many of those champions to function.\n\n> They&#x27;re supposed to get blown up instantly in teamfights. They&#x27;re supposed to skirmish, not teamfight. \n>\n> It&#x27;s pretty heavily implied.\n\nWith the name only and not the definition of it.\n \n> Situational defensive tools, meaning the only way to survive is to build tanky, which Riot and the playerbase generally doesn&#x27;t like. Every other champ has a unconditional defensive tool; range for marksmen, the &quot;Get-out-of-jail&quot; for assassins, and the natural bulk for tanks/bruisers.\n\nPlayerbase doesn't like when a champion with 3-4 tank items has a damage output similar to an ADC, not that they dislike tanky builds altogether.\n\n> Kinda means a splitpushing type of thing, doesn&#x27;t it?\n\n\"Skirmishers aim to shred through any nearby enemy that approaches. \" That also literally how ADCs function.\n\n> Means they have a generally lackluster teamfight, so they shouldn&#x27;t be doing it. They can&#x27;t kill priority targets or burst them. So... they maul on tanks and juggernauts? Basically, when skirmishers are being created, a lot of their kit power isn&#x27;t really relegated for teamfights.\n\nExcept a lot of their power is in teamfights. Fiora's ult can change the tide of a fight, Yasuo greatly synergizes with teamfighting champion, Ekko provides a good flank and a decent initiation, etc.\n\nOf all skirmishers only Tryndamere in all of his cancerousness doesn't bring anything to a teamfight.\n\n> They shouldn&#x27;t be getting tanky items at all. Fiora, Yi, and Jax shouldn&#x27;t get Titanics, Yas shouldn&#x27;t get Mallet (he used to get Deadman&#x27;s too), Ekko shouldn&#x27;t get SUnfire. Jax shouldn&#x27;t be getting Randuin&#x27;s/visage/ etc.\n\nThey get Titanic's because it provides more damage than it's pure damage counterpart, Yasuo gets Mallet, because he's getting resistance items like Maw or PD _(I used to build Randuin's and Banshee's Spirit Visage back when I played him)_.\n \n> Once again, it&#x27;s not that those items are bad on the champs; it&#x27;s that they&#x27;re too good.\n\nA lot of those items are over-tuned by themselves.

If they are hard to kill, or are good in teamfights, then they aren&#x27;t skirmishing, and are toxic to deal with.\n\nIf they shouldn't then why Riot keeps on reworking pure damage items into pure damage items with defensive capabilities or adding new hybrid (defence/offence) items that benefit skirmishers a great deal?\n\nYes, they should build tanky, because they will blow up the moment they are anyhow focused.\n\nList of skirmishers:\n\n* Fiora - absolutely must build tanky\n* Riven - must build tanky to be of any used mid-late game\n* Yasuo - his defence tools are only good against ranged and skillshots, and gets shit on by melees in teamfights and outside them\n* Tryndamere - possibly the only of the bunch that doesn't need much if any defensive items, thanks to his ult\n* Master Yi - bruiser-like builds are favoured over pure damage options because his defence tools aren't good.\n* Jax - goes tanky to not get blown up the moment he gets in range.\n* Ekko - um... what was he building lately?\n \n> Skirmishers are 1v1ers that aren&#x27;t even as tanky as juggernauts\n\nBut they are tanky due to the nature of interactions required from them. If they don't go at least somewhat tanky they blow up nigh-instantly.\n\n> He shouldn&#x27;t be getting hp in the first place. GA and Triforce were meant for ADCs.\n\n\n> No... ADCs and skirmishers are compeletely different. You need to understand that. One of them isn&#x27;t meant to be roaming and excel at 1v1s usually. They&#x27;re supposed to be grouping. Skirmisher are not meant to teamfight, and are meant to splitpush and 1v1. \n\nDefinition of Skirmishers by Riot Games.\n\n\"**Skirmishers**\nUnlike Assassins, Skirmishers aim to shred through any nearby enemy that approaches. Because Skirmishers lack high-end burst damage or reliable ways of closing in on high-priority targets, they are instead armed with situationally powerful defensive tools to survive in the fray, along with extreme sustained damage to cut down even the most durable targets.\"\n\nI can't see anything saying they aren't meant to teamfight.\n \n> Look at the other Skirmishers:\n> \n> Jax, Yi, Trynd, Riven, Fiora, Ekko. None of those are supposed to be building tanky. If you want to know how poorly the community responded to tank yi, tank fiora, and tank ekko. Ekko had to get a rework to specifically get rid of the tank build. Fiora recieved heavy nerfs, as did Yi.\n\nI don't think you understand what you are talking about.\n\nThe thing about \"tank\" builds you are talking about is that they went with 3-4 tank items and or 2-3 hybrid items.\nBut getting 2 tank items and 4 pure damage items is also a \"tanky\" build.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sraeg2013","date":"2017-05-09T23:57:50.878+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=VulDread,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=mdeEjnOW,comment-id=00040000000000010001000000000000000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2017-05-09T23:24:40.600+0000)\n>\n> Riot balance the game for soloQ according to play+ statistics.

Otherwise he has to leech on team picking, say, Malphite and hoping for a 5-man ult to not die durning his own ult.\n\n> Hp from Mallet or Triforce, for instance.\n\nMallet by itself is shit, that's why it was never a problem before. Rito tried to force_(heh)_ Trinity Force into an ADC item, which they failed at.\nI also always provided health and it's not like it was unheard of for Yasuo players to buy it occasionally.\n\n> He also uses the GA.\n\nWhich, again, was almost always the case.\n\n> Ik why ADCs need all the survivability, but not skirmishers. ADCs aren&#x27;t meant to be able to live off by themselves and need peel, but skirmishers are meant to be able to 1v1 anyone.\n\nWait... really?\nSo a melee class doesn't require survivability, but a ranged class that has basically the whole game designed around them does?\n\nAre you sure you are comprehending what you are writing at this point?","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"EvilUnicornLord","date":"2017-05-05T14:30:09.231+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know, but even if Yasuo counts for 50% of melee crit, Yi, Tryndamere, _maybe_ Xin Zhao make up the other half.
