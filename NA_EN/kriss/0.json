Basically, if I were to alt-tab in Ranked champ select (draft mode), the champ select would bug out. The timer (regardless of whose picking), proceeds to 0 and during the time, I can't see any continuation of the draft on my end. After it hits 0, the chat would say that my other four teammates have left and I get disconnected from PvP. Finally, I get booted into the main menu where I suffer lp loss and a queue time penalty. Help? (Besides the obvious: Don't alt-tab; since I look up match-ups and masteries). Thanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-12T18:52:25.570+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When you are in champion select, the server groups everyone together and moves them over.
