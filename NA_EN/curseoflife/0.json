But if someone only plays a couple times a week, and plays enough champs/premade enough to where he can get a chest every week, they will not have enough fragments to open the chests that they get.\n\nI imagine there will be a small percentage of the player base that has a rising number of chests that they will never conceivably be able to open all of unless they purchase additional keys. Working as intended? Maybe. But i can't complain about free stuff too much.","replies":[]}]}
