What's so bad you may ask? Well After constant crashes trying to load into a game, I have been greeted with Leaver Buster after Leaver Buster. I have had to sit through 25 leaver busters this whole week. I reported this as a bug but honestly i don't really know what the problem is (I play on a low spec computer using Low Spec Mode, doesn't do much by the way). One Instance I got disconnected due to a crash error, so I tried to log in and got the crash again. Confused I tried to get back in one more time and guess what? IT CRASHED YET AGAIN! Please fix this and fix low spec mode because honestly not a single player should have to go through what I experienced this week. I'm not asking for any kind of apology gift or anything (I wouldn't mind though). I just want to get awareness out for us low spec users and to avoid any problems like this in the future. Thank you for reading this.\n\n  {{sticker:zombie-brand-clap}}","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-14T22:10:58.778+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh man.....I honestly don't know which sounds worse to me xD.\n\nJokes aside, low spec mode was a good first step but it sounds like this issue might possibly be stemming from some kind of damaged or corrupted game files. Let's take some time to go through this [**crash guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974) as a first step. Test those changes in a custom or practice game, but hit me back up if you still can't get back on the Rift.","replies":[]}]}
