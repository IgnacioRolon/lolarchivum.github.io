I posted there too but i couldn't get proper support.\r\n\r\n I've had this internet provider for like 7 years now, a 100mbps fiber-link plan, but in this last year i've been encountering higher ping than ever, both on EUW and EUNE. I used to have like 30-40 ms while lately it never went lower than 60.\r\n\r\nI tried pinging the euw and eune's ip addresses in cmd just out of curiosity and i had a surprise. On eune, the ping reported in cmd is **35ms**, and goes as high as 38. On euw, the ping reported is about 47ms. It's fine cause EUNE is my region anyway but i've been playing on euw as well for a while.\r\n\r\nHere is a speed test. http://www.speedtest.net/my-result/5497615756\r\n\r\nWorth to mention that i'm [usually] using a router from which that bandwidth is redirected to 2 computers and some wi-fi devices. I tried connecting directly to my own computer @ PPPOE so i could get all the bandwidth and see how the ping modifies. Surprisingly, the ping is exactly the same. **It usually stands at 63ms and does not fluctuate the whole match long**  ( STRANGE ! I remember how it used to fluctuate from second to second in the past )\r\n\r\nTell me what you think. My neighbors and friends with the same internet provider ( and plan ) are experiencing 30-40ms.","replies":[{"poster":"Bronze Fiend","date":"2016-07-23T17:52:07.414+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Issued a request there too, pretty used to it. Thanks for your fast respose, i'm really grateful.\n\nWhy does the EUNE (specially) and EUW does not get the attention NA gets ? Did riot gave up already on these servers ? I mean, the boards gets no support at all, i'm continuously experiencing 20 mins queue even for blind picks. Also EUNE encounters problem with the client on a regular base. I got pretty used to that exclamation mark embed in a triangle and the ranked queues being disabled. EUW on the other side didn't ever encounter such problems but the forums are dead both on EUNE and EUW. No important subject to gather some attention ( my guess : too many immature people don't even know it even exist such thing as a board and when they remember, it's all about complaining. ), no support from rioters ( or any at all ). May i even mention that NA is well-known to reward its players more often ? I remember NA players got rewarded once cause some issues with client or ranked queues or drop-hack attemtps while this happened on eune too many times and we didn't even get a sorry !","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-23T16:52:56.042+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for going through all of those steps to troubleshoot this.
