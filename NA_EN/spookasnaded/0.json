Comparing one champion's results at the end of a game to another champion's results is thus not a legitimate comparison in terms of what rank you placed for that game. It's a lot easier to get an S rank with a champion playing an abnormal role or abnormal build and done so successfully than it is to build exactly the same as everyone else who plays that champion in that role, and pull it off successfully, as the first case, you're compared to a lot fewer people, whereas the second case, you're compared to a lot more people.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-07T05:51:59.898+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Basically what Kokua said here. Mastery scores are independent to the champion you chose and which lane you played them in, so saying a Garen in your game getting an S wouldn't have anything to do with your score. You may not have had the best vision or creep score, but also keep in mind *you're being compared to others who played the same champion in the role that you played*.","replies":[]}]}]}
