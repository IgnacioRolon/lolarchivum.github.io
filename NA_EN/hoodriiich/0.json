Now that I did not get accepted to medical school in the first cycle, I've thought to myself: \"Hell, why not go for it?\"\r\nSo, my question(s) is(are):\r\n\r\nwhat is the right direction to take to get into the video game industry?\r\n\r\nComputer science vs. Computer Engineering vs. ?\r\n\r\nWhat are courses I def need to take?\r\n\r\nGo for Master's?\r\n\r\nInternships?\r\n\r\n\r\nMaybe a little more detail about my situation would help:\r\n\r\nI have a Bachelor's of Science in BME with minors in Chem and Bio. I have taken a few courses dealing with computers and beginner coding (MatLab and a very small amount of C++), and a couple of courses dealing with CAD programs and models. In Senior Design, I was in charge of the computer models of our product and did stress and fracture testing etc. (not in great detail, but enough to get an A).\r\n\r\nAssume money and time are not that restrictive. I'd like to think that courses I've already taken would help and/or count towards the computer field in some sense.\r\n\r\nPlease be as honest and open as possible, as any single response could greatly influence my future :)","replies":[{"poster":"Griftrix","date":"2014-11-18T06:07:20.799+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"OMG a thread where I actually have some expertise.

I also just realized that the full title did not fit for this post. The last part was supposed to be Computer Science/Computer Engineering, to invoke a possible comparison between the two (I myself do not know).\n\nAlso, to clarify, my best bet would be to reapply as an undergrad for a whole new CS degree? Would anything from my BME bachelors count towards this?    \n\nWould probably go for financial aid a second time around, as the full 4 year freshman scholarship wont apply this time, as far as I know.

It wouldn't hurt to have a portfolio of impressive software projects that you worked on.\n\nIf you want to do game **design**, you will have a hard time getting hired without a portfolio of (good) games that you have worked on.  Design positions are very competitive in general -- everyone has ideas and opinions, so you'd better have OMGWTF amazing ideas and/or a track record of making things that don't suck.  I don't know how much a game design degree will help.\n\nOther ways to try to get your foot in the door:\n\nQA/Testing/Tech Support positions don't usually require specialty degrees.  Some companies will promote from within if you prove yourself.  Or you could try to go to school part time while working and then apply to programming or design jobs elsewhere once you have a relevant degree and some industry experience.\n\nInternships can be a way to get experience -- if they're available, and you can get accepted, and you can afford to work for little or no pay for a while.\n\nIT is another whole career path you could consider, although it tends to require its own training/certification/specializations.  Maybe a little less sexy, but somebody's got to run all those servers and datacenters.\n\n>Computer science vs. Computer Engineering vs. ?\n\nAgain, if you want to do **programming** specifically you probably want a degree in CS.  CE tends to focus more on hardware, although this varies depending on the school.  If you're interested in things like working on game console hardware then a CE degree could be the way to go, but that quickly becomes a very specialized field.\n\n> What are courses I def need to take?\n\nGame programming really involves everything these days.  You at least want the basics: Object-Oriented Programming, Algorithms and Data Structures, Networking, AI, Graphics, Systems/Operating Systems.  Math, especially Discrete Mathematics (which usually includes some Probability) and Linear Algebra.  Any Bachelor's program in CS should cover all of those even if it's not specific to game programming.\n\nGames with a significant online component can also need stuff like Databases, Data Mining, and can run into the kinds of scalability issues that generally fall under the \"High Performance Computing\" umbrella.  Some CS programs may have specific advanced courses in topics like game engines.\n\n>Go for Master's?\n\nIf you don't have an undergrad degree in CS, you probably couldn't get into a Master's program in CS without taking a bunch of undergrad prereqs first.  Depending on the program (and exactly what you took getting your undergrad degree) you may just need a few additional courses to catch up, or you might be able to work towards both a Bachelor's and Master's degree simultaneously if you go back to school full time.\n\nEntry level programming positions shouldn't require a Master's degree.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Phaite","date":"2014-11-18T17:50:54.490+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Some colleges offer degrees in game development.  Factually, at the end of this semester, I will have my certificate, and at the end of this upcoming Spring semester, I will be graduating with my Associate's Degree in the Applied Science of Simulation and Game Development.  It's a very generalized program, giving you a look into all of the processes involved in game development and design: software engineering, programming, art, 3D modeling, level design, etc., etc., etc.  This allows you to find the parts of the process you enjoy doing the most and then choose what you'd like to specialize in.  It's still an emerging degree program, so there are some things that need to be expanded on, and a wider assortment of classes would be great, but overall, I've found it to be a good program, both informative and enjoyable.  If I knew of a University that offered a Bachelor's program in SGD, I'd already be signed up for it.

While I can't offer much advice in going down the video gaming path, I can say that you should pursue what you have a passion for so you have no regrets later in life.  \n\nAlmost every video gamer I know has hated med school, despite enjoying the medical profession. Many of them, while have no regrets, have wondered what life would be like if they had pursued an alternate career path.  That said, not getting accepted to med school allowing you to think about your passions might've been the best thing to happen to you.  While I have no experience down that route myself, I definitely think taking a year or two off before med school to \"grow\" is good.  If you happen to decide a career path in video gaming is something you could do with the rest of your life, then all the better.\n\nDo you have any friends/acquaintances that went down this path/ had this path open to them that you could talk to?  Idk how your school is, but I felt like during undergrad I made plenty of friends who went into those fields just by enjoying video games.","replies":[]}]}
