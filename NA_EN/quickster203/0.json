Any time I play in a game with a jinx running the skin my ping goes up and my fps drops. I&#039;m tired of having it happen and almost impossible to play with. Others I&#039;ve run into have had the same issue and I thought I&#039;d be fixed prior to Jinx going on free rotation which now it seems like everyone is running it. This needs fixed and Pantheon&#039;s probably needs fixed too but haven&#039;t had the chance to run into one using it as of late.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-12-07T21:36:48.553+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Quickster203, \n\nWould  you mind attaching a Dx Diag in a comment?

Last few games while she was in free rotation someone used the skin and everything was seemingly fine. However you might want to edit how you instruct for grabbing files since not all users are running a Windows OS that allows for the Windows key to be used for that function (i.e. Windows 8/8.1 like I am). I know how to run the commands but just in case someone you run across doesn't it'd be a good idea.\n\nThanks for the help though and if I do run into the bug again I'll surely grab the file and attach it to a reply.","replies":[]}]}]}
