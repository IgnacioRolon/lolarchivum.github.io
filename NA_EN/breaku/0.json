Any advice would be great!","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-07T03:16:50.977+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since our test servers are designed to reject packets, any packet loss that occurs after hitting our servers should not be considered when troubleshooting packet loss. I suggest running a full-on traceroute using [WinMTR](http://winmtr.net/) and the IP **104.160.131.1**. I recommend running the trace for **5 minutes** before exporting the results as text and pasting them in a reply to me.\n\nLet me know if you have any issues with this.","replies":[]}]}
