I like to compare this creep to that of slowly heating up the water in a shower, bath, etc. It changes so slowly that you don&#039;t notice it at all until you look back (or change it back) to what it was a good while ago. Players looking back see that over time the game has added so much power creep that we have the mess we see today.\n\nThe blame cast on the developers isn&#039;t just the blind rage you see in soloq, there has been a lot of constructive criticism for awhile now. \n\nThe first big upset to the community was the midseason patch for S7, including big updates to some tanks. Riot had their heart in the right place and noticeably put effort into the redesigns, however in many peoples&#039; view, it was a flop. This can be blamed on the toxic jungle meta that spawned from it. When this occurred, it was a hot topic for discussion. People spouted the ugly term &quot;Tank Meta&quot; about for a good while (which I will probably cover in a whole separate post) and actively suggested solutions to the problem. Some good, some bad. Some wanted reverts, others wanted numbers tweaks, and few even suggested another update. At this point NOT many people were very upset at the developers at all, especially since the start of season 7, after the fixes to adc (and killing our meme), was quite smooth. The real screwup was when Riot actively IGNORED or REFUSED all of the criticism it took from the players.\n\nThe next big thing in season 7 would have to be the ardent meta. I myself blame this meta (as a mid lane mage main) for screwing with my ranked matches, seeing as my climb from Silver V to Gold IV, which took place in a matter of weeks, abruptly stopped and I simply couldn&#039;t win anymore without a good bot lane. The winrate on my main, Veigar, dropped from a whopping 74% to 66% by the end of the season (and that is over around 70 games of veigar in S7), and winrate overall dropped from around 65% to 56%. This thing made A LOT of people angry. Not because of the actual ardent meta existing in the first place, but because it wasn&#039;t fixed at all until about 2 patches before preseason. Riot abused the &quot;muh worlds&quot; excuse way too much and we had pretty much the latter half of the summer and early fall in absolute misery. Standalone this isn&#039;t a real killer to the community, but factoring in the tank jungle meta before, and what happened after, it really is.\n\nYou see, the reason people kept playing during the ardent meta was because of one promise from the developers: &quot;Preseason will fix most of the problems with the game.&quot; When preseason came around, the players were excited to change from the trash meta they had before. Players saw a transition  from a teamfight where the adc can literally tank your whole team from all the heals/shields/peel they get, to now absolute kill lanes and players being wiped in seconds. Theoretically, this would be nice, but it wasn&#039;t. **This is because the added damage was not properly set up by any other balance changes.** Think about it. Did mages and assassins become super viable again like previous seasons, or instead did ADCs start picking up full damage + crit and start outputting Burst Per Second that could wipe everyone 1v5? Did the high amount kills around other ever-present gold income from previous metas, like first turret gold, make games way more snowbally? It sure did.\n\nAt this point the players&#039; tempers were stretched thin. This was a problem and we looked upon one last promise from Riot: &quot;Preseason may be unbalanced so we will try to fix it.&quot; Patch 7.24b was an INCREDIBLE let down. Riot promised changes to top lane, which they did test extensively in the PBE, but ended up just rolling them back. While this in itself isn&#039;t a bad move, Riot neglected to replace those changes before the patch dropped. Players now had to endure for the holidays (one of the best times for gaming) with a terribly unbalanced game while Rioters were not even working.\n\nThat was the last straw. The entire time players had been offering good ideas and constructive criticism. There are still a plethora of threads, articles, and videos about how the game could be improved, but Riot never listened. On top of that, they actively failed to follow through with their promises of actual game balance, all the while CertainlyT would develop a second Yasuo.\n\nThis is the point where players start calling for the balance team to be fired. I agree, this is absolutely unacceptable, and is the first time since midseason 6 that I am actively trying to avoid playing league, even in the holiday season. We, the players have gone through a hell of a terrible ride over the past **5 months or so,** and honestly have all rights to start calling out the team for their blatant neglect.\n\nTLDR: Riot hasn't listened to the playerbase over a multitude of patches spanning about 5 months. While their fuckups in balance weren't that bad, the fact that they didn't fix them at all, or until much later, made people upset enough to call on the firing of the balance team.","replies":[{"poster":"Laura ß","date":"2018-01-02T19:04:11.447+0000","up_votes":42,"down_votes":5,"body":"Season 7 worlds {{item:3504}} meta\n\nI wonder what face the balance team did everytime the saw {{champion:40}} fully shield and heal{{champion:96}} to near invinsivility\n\nAnd they want us not to rage lol this people in riot have their egos too high","replies":[{"poster":"GayFluffyUnicorn","date":"2018-01-02T23:35:19.940+0000","up_votes":31,"down_votes":1,"body":"The ego really is a problem sometimes. \nThink about playtest team telling us galio Q oneshotting people was thorougly tested in a \"highly\" competitive environment and is fine.","replies":[{"poster":"Theorex","date":"2018-01-03T02:26:47.325+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":8,"body":"I forgot that they were a team.\n\nWhat are THEY doing.\n\nHoly shit.

You focus on the META champions and ignore long forgotten champions which might counter those picks in the first place. Some of the underplayed champions might be a safety valve against the META champions becoming overbearing if they were given some love. Also playing champions who are countered by the META champion might give the insight necessary to distinguish when and why the META champion is overbearing in their matchups while giving greater insights into the game as a whole instead of just on the individual champion. \n\nMaybe the playtesters should try for a variety of experiences to get insights from different angles instead of spamming a small handful of the strong champions limiting their ability to comment on the game as a whole.

Just a dissenting opinion though.\n\nWe generally have pretty good coverage on champions in terms of understanding them. Most players on my team have played the game in high elo for a loooong time (I've played since January of 2010). That said, there is a certain amount of game knowledge filtering that good players will do to avoid wasting time. I don't think playing 10 Volibear/nunu games is necessary to determine that they're not  hidden counters to Malzahar.

If balance and playtesting was focused not on rotating the meta of what is currently strong, but on a vision of what a balanced game would look like i think we would all be in a better spot. \n\nIf Malz is over-performing (to piggyback off your example) questions need to be asked about why his counters aren't able to do their jobs against him. Maybe Malz is just plain too strong, maybe his kit is covering his own weaknesses too well, maybe his counters are just too weak overall, or maybe his counters strengths are being mitigated in unintended ways that have nothing to do with Malz. Like, maybe his counters ([Swain](http://www.op.gg/champion/malzahar/statistics/mid),  [Karthus](http://www.op.gg/champion/malzahar/statistics/mid), [Anivia](http://www.op.gg/champion/malzahar/statistics/mid)), [Gangplank](http://lolcounter.com/champions/malzahar), [Syndra](http://lolcounter.com/champions/malzahar), [Galio](http://lolcounter.com/champions/malzahar), to list counters that i can source for credibility...\\) are mostly late game scaling champions in a fast meta, and game pacing issues are the underlying reason for Malz's strength. That's the kind of insight that you probably won't get by spamming Malz.\n\nEDIT: -----\n\nAlso on the flip side Malz counters [early game snowballing champions](http://lolcounter.com/champions/malzahar) that are popular in the fast meta and so they can not snowball against him because they are countered, while also not being able to transition into the mid/late game because they were unable to get the lead that their champion needs to function. Some of that is just how his counter matchups work, but shorter games mean there is less time for those early game champions to find ways to eek out an advantage somewhere other than early lane. \n\nMalz just happens to serve as a microcosm of why game pacing is a problem right now, and similar strengths and weaknesses continue to pop up through the game in other lanes as well. We are seemingly left with a choice between homogenizing power curves of champions somewhat to compensate for shortening game lengths, increasing game lengths back to what they were a few years ago, or [leaving these problems to continue cropping up.](http://izquotes.com/quotes-pictures/quote-failure-is-always-an-option-adam-savage-163193.jpg) In any case, [Happy New Year, and Cheers Mate!](http://m.memegen.com/kw2m1r.jpg)","replies":[{"poster":"playtestpenguin","date":"2018-01-04T03:54:11.949+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"i didn't mean to assume you meant spam every character, was just using that as an example of why stressing off-meta characters isn't always the go-to strategy as it is both time consuming and often not worth it. \n\nAgreed with a few of your points on Malzahar benefitting from current game pacing; most of his opponents are not champions that feel confidently powerful rushing QSS and most champions that do (Ryze/Cassio) are weak for the majority of the playerbase. \n\nDisagree that those champions are counters to a properly played malzahar though, but it was a worthy observation to say that looking into counters and meta-state are key to proper analysis -- but Malzahar was also one of the highest WR mid champions prior to preseason and ever since we made his most recent changes.

Morello still shaking his head, Meddler explains that Rivens overall winrate dropped from 51% to 50%. \nAsking for a solution Morello suggests to nerf Irelia and Merril, who was not pleased by the answer, executed Morello in front of Meddler with a headshot from his personal .357 Magnum. \nIn fear of sharing Morellos fate Meddler suggests buffing up her dmg numbers like crazy, that always helps. \nMerill nods, giving his approval and thus Meddler buffed up her numbers. Half an hour later the alarm went silent and the monitor showed rivens global winrate back at 51% and then even rising to  52% winrate. \nVisibly satisfied Merril left the room with a simple \"Good job\" towards Meddler. \n\nThe end.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Divewing","date":"2018-01-03T01:14:46.335+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I personally think this is the main issue.\n\nPeople make posts all the time calling others out with stuff like; \"we've been saying this since season 2\", and yet it's never addressed","replies":[]},{"poster":"ReZisT Lust","date":"2018-01-04T06:52:56.569+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"teemos move quick is w & e is toxic shot, e is always active","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Z3Sleeper","date":"2018-01-03T00:57:42.418+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Literally nothing has changed since the beginning of this game in terms of how they go about fixing things that are broken.\n\nRemember AP Yi? That abomination (my favorite champ) was allowed to live for TWO SEASONS. Remember Soraka mid cuz of click target Q and E? Several patches after being FotM as well. AP Tryndamere? Same deal. Irelia? Yep. Mordekaiser? Uhuh. Blade of the Ruined King? (original) Assassin Meta? Shyvanna Top being a thing for several seasons via relying on extremely overtuned damage? Feral Flare? Devourer? Literally Ezreal about 8 times throughout the years? Zilean mid with click target ranged metric burst? Nunu top the most oppressive and meta thing at some point? Azir forever? Hecarim top? Jug Update Garen (took a few patches til they finally gutted him again)? Tank Kat x4-ish? Tank Fizz? Tank Ekko? Lulu top? Yasuo forever? Syndra's obnoxiously large stun hitbox that lasted over a season? Mordekaiser again?\n\nThe list is much, much larger than that where broken things that were complained about took several patches or even seasons until they were addressed. Nothing has changed. They've been through this before. There's always gonna be a subset of players complaining, a majority of players who don't care and just play the game anyway or adapt, and a subset of twisted fucks who actually like things like Ardent Meta and Tank Fizz.","replies":[{"poster":"Jamenawerl","date":"2018-01-03T13:21:50.489+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"So much this.\n\nNever forgetti 99% banrate Kassawin for 3 years.
