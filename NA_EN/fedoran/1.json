Also has much better bonus AD ratio and slightly better AP ratio. Has higher base damages at level 18 (which is mostly irrelevant if you stack Dark Harvest)\r\n\r\n**Dark Harvest advantages**: Has no cooldown at all as long as you collect a soul (can be procced twice in a single cannon wave), whereas Electrocute has a **50-25 second cooldown** based on level. Dark Harvest scales much harder into late game because it has infinite stacking, and it completely eclipses Electrocute's base damage at 140 stacks assuming level 18 (you should expect to get 200 stacks by between 20 and 35 minutes depending on kill participation), meaning you will probably get more damage before then because the starting base damage for both keystones is much closer than the end. Dark Harvest is also procced on a **SINGLE** autoattack, whereas Electrocute requires 3 part combos. Most importantly, Dark Harvest will reset on a kill or get a pseudoreset on just any **Ally or Enemy** dying nearby (because you can pick up the soul). This means that if you successfully assassinate someone you can go straight to the next target. This synergizes very well with champions like {{champion:121}} .\r\n\r\nSo when shoud I choose either Dark Harvest or Electrocute? My personal rule is if I'm not sure, just take Dark Harvest, but here are some example champions:\r\n\r\n**Electrocute Champs: **{{champion:34}} {{champion:9}} {{champion:43}} {{champion:7}} {{champion:127}} {{champion:76}} {{champion:134}} {{champion:45}} {{champion:101}} {{champion:1}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:30}} {{champion:143}} \r\n\r\n**Dark Harvest Champs: **{{champion:103}} {{champion:84}} {{champion:136}} {{champion:268}} (?){{champion:432}} {{champion:53}} {{champion:164}} {{champion:42}} {{champion:131}} {{champion:245}} {{champion:60}} {{champion:28}} {{champion:81}} {{champion:3}} {{champion:79}} {{champion:74}} {{champion:420}} {{champion:126}} {{champion:202}} {{champion:38}} {{champion:55}} {{champion:141}}  {{champion:99}} {{champion:90}} {{champion:75}} {{champion:56}} {{champion:61}} {{champion:516}} {{champion:80}} {{champion:133}} {{champion:421}} {{champion:107}} {{champion:35}} {{champion:37}} {{champion:412}} {{champion:4}} {{champion:77}} {{champion:161}} {{champion:112}} {{champion:254}} {{champion:8}} {{champion:19}} {{champion:62}} {{champion:5}} {{champion:238}} {{champion:115}} \r\n\r\n**Either: ** {{champion:105}} {{champion:91}} {{champion:85}} {{champion:64}} \r\n\r\nPlease note that either Dark Harvest or Electrocute are not always the best keystones on these champs, but are viable for burst damage (such as Anivia taking comet instead or Ornn taking Aftershock)","replies":[]}
