I took the unfair treatment at first, then again, this happened, my game crashed, just when I was starting to play my last 20mins waited low prior game. Well guess what happened next? I got another 5 games of 20mins waiting. I'm not taking it this time like how I did last time, please remove that 20mins waiting for me, I did send the error report already. I'm a leader of a high school lol club in NZ, and my team was about to go on for some practise matches tomorrow in ranked flex, or if that doesn't happen I will play some normal to have fun on Friday. So please, dear riot, solve , this, unfair, stuff, happened to me!!! please!!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-02-16T19:04:45.910+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A [leaverbuster](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ) penalty will only apply after a history of leaving and not just one game.  Even if your intent is not to leaving, they still cause others a negative experience so it's important to get this fixed up.  It sounds like you've having bugsplats which happens when something like drivers are failing to render the game.  Use the [game crash](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes+) guide to get that fixed up.  Let me know if that clears things up!","replies":[]}]}
