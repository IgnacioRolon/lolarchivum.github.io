I am concerned about the size of my... pointer. Its a little on the small size. I mean it gets the job done but lets be honest, when you have a \"smaller\" pointer, it can get lost. Just recently I was playing and lost my pointer. I was thinking, how the heck can I lose it, I just had it in my hand!? Its been challenging to say the least. I could use some advice. I've been searching all over the internet to increase my pointer size in League and nothing seemed to work. I mean really, when you set your resolution to 4k, why doesn't my pointer change size too? I mean that's what we're talking about here, resolution and UI issues.","replies":[{"poster":"ThesonofShiva","date":"2017-03-26T19:20:04.149+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This game is so bad, HOW HAVE THEY NOT FUCKING FIXED THIS YET??? and I try to do a test game with bots, and its going to give me a penalty for leaving a game with no rewards and bots. man fuck this game so hard.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talidus","date":"2016-08-27T18:01:18.342+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea at this point not having UI support for 4K is somewhat ridiculous. Also, I am not going to say anything about game balance and the field of view that I see is much larger than at 2k ;)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shuten √êoji","date":"2016-08-21T03:30:09.599+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had this problem too when I switched over to Windows 10... it threw me way off when I started playing with the tiny cursor. I still lose track of it occasionally but I've gotten sort of used to it. x_X\n\nWould be nice if we were able to directly change the size in game someday.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-20T22:31:24.312+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I was going to ask if you are using 4K, and it looks like that's indeed the case.  This isn't currently supported, so your best bet would be to reduce your resolution in-game and possibly your monitor too.  This should in turn increase the size of your pointer!","replies":[]}]}
