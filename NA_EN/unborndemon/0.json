He&#039;s described in lore as this legendary God of War kind of character, who could also be seen as some kind of demon who empowers his allies in battle and sways the course of battle. I personally really enjoy Aatrox lore and concept, but it really saddens me to see that he is in such an abysmal state. His kit is really clunky and very underwhelming,  Most of his &quot;core&quot; items are really expensive and  he doesn&#039;t synergize well with any item outside of BORK. Aatrox can be strong late game , it&#039;s hard to get there unless you&#039;re fed or snowballing.\r\n\r\nI would love to hear what you guys think Rito should do for Aatrox and your ideas to make him a more effective champion in game. Hopefully someone from Riot sees this and takes it into consideration for which champion/ champion class needs a rework{{champion:266}}","replies":[{"poster":"ReshiKillim","date":"2016-08-03T03:56:51.419+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd like for his ult AS buff to be a team buff that scales with how many enemies his ult hits.","replies":[{"poster":"macromite","date":"2016-08-03T03:58:01.564+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Part of the reason why he is so weak is because of the double attack speed buff.","replies":[{"poster":"ReshiKillim","date":"2016-08-03T04:01:30.488+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, but it would give him some nice utility in a teamfight, and I'd also like to see his blood price damage get a change so it gets a 50% or more increase when below 50% HP.","replies":[{"poster":"macromite","date":"2016-08-03T12:30:07.551+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"that removes part of the interaction, blood price is for when he has a lot of health, blood thirst is for when he's low.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Marshbouy","date":"2016-08-03T03:59:11.421+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"poppys weaker :(","replies":[{"poster":"UnbornDemon","date":"2016-08-03T11:57:07.708+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm just focusing on Aatrox cause with some minor buffs Poppy can rise back up, while Aatrox needs more than just that","replies":[{"poster":"Marshbouy","date":"2016-08-03T12:41:57.054+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"needs a full rework too, or at least a big rework.\n\nI liked aatrox until i got sick of losing","replies":[]}]}]}]}
