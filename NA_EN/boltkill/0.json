It last for like 2-10 sec where it starts with a freeze, followed by my character still moving on my last input before the lag. If my hp goes to 0 my hp bar disappears and i still run with the last input. Any suggestions on a fix?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-09T01:14:26.063+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When your character seems to freeze and then start moving on their own with delayed commands, there's a pretty good chance that your network is having some problems with packet loss.
