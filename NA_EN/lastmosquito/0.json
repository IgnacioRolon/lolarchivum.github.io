They are peaceful and quiet people that live in the depths of the forest, hiding themselves with magic. Unlike the rest of his kind, Kai is loud, prideful and impatient. He left his people at a very young age. With his power and good heart, he saved many Vastayan people and soon gained the title \"Flaming Guardian of Vastayan.\" With every battle he fought, his power slowly turned turned into something unfamiliar and violent. This change in power began to eat away at Kai's body and he lives through restless torment daily. After a time, Kai was swallowed by unbearable pain and collapsed. Upon waking, he found the pain was gone and half of his body was replaced by strange mechanical parts. Now, Kai walks between the cities of Piltover and Zaun, with fists of flame and lighting.\n\nPassive: Flow of power\nKai slowly regenerate Arcane charge and divine energy through out the game. the regeneration speed is doubled when out of combat.\n\nQ: Sky-bound Grab/Seismic Slam\n(learned from his best friend blizcrank and Vi)\nSky-bound Grab: Grabbing the target from a distance and send it to sky.
