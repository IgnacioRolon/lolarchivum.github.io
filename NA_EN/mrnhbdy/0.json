There's not much that I can say about this as we write bios and stories to contain further story hooks. In some cases, we have hinted towards things that are in development for a future release, but in the case of the Void being Aurelion Sol senses, it isn't something we've been actively working on. It was more there to put Aurelion Sol in perspective -- that there are things that could give a star-forging ageless dragon pause and make it shudder. In other words: there are entities that would give him a fight, that he might not be able to understand, or that he believes could pose a threat. \n\nSo far, our celestial pantheon is still growing. It's one of my favorite areas of Runeterra to write for. Hope I get to do some more stuff there soon.","replies":[{"poster":"Chromatic Eagle","date":"2016-12-19T21:48:22.546+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How big do you plan on making space lore?

I don't know that we will explore all of the massive cosmos unless there's a really good story reason to do so, or unless it's seen through the eyes of those bound to Runeterra. \n\nI won't say never, but right now, it's not the focus.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MrNhbdy","date":"2016-12-19T22:00:51.118+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you very much, though its not something in progress , its still exciting to know there are forces we have yet to see and are possible to contend with our cosmic dragon.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"PraetorAmalthus","date":"2016-12-15T23:03:56.943+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"CanÂ´t they just rework Cho into a being that would fit that description?

As much as I'd rather it not be Cho'gath, he does seem like a very strong pick based on personality and what is said about him. \n\nMy issue with it being Cho'gath is that the creature created a rift between dimensions, one unlike Sol has seen before. Cho is not known to have this ability and though Cho is powerful, do we really want him to be the \"top dog\" of the void? Cho has said that daylight hurts him, this would be a very short battle for Sol.\n\nI may be looking to much into this and my idea of what the void could be may be a little much. I'd just like to see something more complex then a monster that grows bigger after it had a snack. This creature doesn't have to be a supreme ruler, just make it \"one of the greats\" , ya know?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sharjo","date":"2016-12-15T18:09:20.779+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not currently.
