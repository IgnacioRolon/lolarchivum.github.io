It happens for about 10-20 seconds and then goes away, but it happens at multiple points in the game randomly. Sometime it even happens in the client and freezes up my whole pc. When it freezes in game everything else in the background works such as Discord. I am positive that I have updated drivers. Please any help would be appreciated\r\n\r\nHere are my specs\r\n\r\nWindows 7 64 bit\r\nAMD fx-4300 - 3.8 ghz\r\nAMD radeon r7 200 processor\r\n8 gb ram","replies":[{"poster":"ΛLΣSIΛ","date":"2017-12-18T12:18:46.337+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thats kind of a bullsht, i have updated everything,checked my connection it is fine and im getting freezes all the time and not only for 20 sec .When i play an aram it can keep like that the whole game the champs are flashing around on my screem like i have 2 k lag ( but i dont have)....so what is the issue here?

They ruin a lot of my games too. {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}}\n\nMight be able to figure out what's causing the freezes though! Instead of a driver issue, freezes tend to be a connection issue. Even if other programs like Discord are running, something could be interfering with LoL's connection specifically.\nI suggest troubleshooting the game's connection with [**these steps here**](http://riot.com/12B7oac); there are a lot, but following through with each step will help solidify your connection or eliminate it as a potential cause. Get back to me on the results and whether it helped out, and we can work from there!\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"utopian99","date":"2017-05-28T02:06:22.748+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Will do, thank you","replies":[]}]}]}
