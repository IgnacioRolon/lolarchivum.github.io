Death Timers are still a major problem in LCS, but that's about it. \n\nAlso, always remember that C9 does not care about winning in NA. They only care about winning internationally. They are clearly trolling right now, but at least it's fun. TSM fosters a pretty nasty working environment with a pretty nasty leader in Bjergson who DEMANDS greatness in NA play because he suffers from an inferiority complex in international play. TSM is an embarrassment to the NA region and nothing will change that.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BigBellBrute","date":"2019-06-17T21:52:03.638+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Considering Liquid has won the last three splits, Riot is certainly doing a terrible job cheating for TSM and fixing the games.
