It's why riot has punished professional players for behind toxic during games. They even fined Hai for throwing a middle finger when it was not shown on any stream\n\nNo reason why TSM should be spamming emotes and BMing teams. You don't ever see Koreas doing that to NA/EU despite having a monopoly in terms of dominance. I get That other reason get happy when they win so they believe they are welcomed to do it.\n\nStixxays interview should be a hallmark for how NA and EU need to behave. Top team in NA, dude legit says TSM is perfect to represent NA. That's called professional. If you can't act like one, probably shouldn't call yourself professional on a stream\n\nThat's just my opinion","replies":[{"poster":"BigBellBrute","date":"2017-07-07T23:09:35.177+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"I found it extremely classless.
