I was very please with what discounts I had received. I then logged out to do something and when I logged back into my account, I viewed my Lunar Revel store and saw that 3 of the discounts had changed. I am extremely annoyed because I was looking forward to those exact three skins. Has anyone else had this issue? Or am I the only unlucky person here? \r\n\r\nIs there anyway to fix this and get those three discounts back?","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-01-29T05:53:35.808+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey Elsavon665 - \n\nThe skins that are being replaced in your Lunar Revel Shop are scheduled to go on sale either in January or February.

I was going to buy the skin. Now I won't. :(","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"PSG Pig","date":"2016-01-29T01:49:22.809+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The same thing happened to me. I was planning on buying Hired Gun Lucian at 50% off but the change happened the next time I logged on. I got Arclight Vayne instead... However I already have multiple Vayne skins so I am extremely disappointed. This first picture is my initial Lunar Revel draw, but the next picture is my Lucian discount replaced with Vayne. Rito pls help so you can take more of my money. \nInitial\n[IMG]http://i68.tinypic.com/2ewfvhz.png[/IMG]\nNow\n[IMG]http://i66.tinypic.com/fnybfs.png[/IMG]","replies":[]},{"poster":"LegendaryWolfeh","date":"2016-01-29T01:02:36.370+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same thing, this morning had Poolparty Graves at 60% off and Royal Guard Fiora at 70% off. Get home this evening, Now it's Hired Gun Graves at 60% and Nightraven Fiora at 70% off. Feelsbadman since I wanted to get Royal Guard Fiora since I had enough RP, haha, I only have 175 left and with the discount it'd have been enough. Nightraven is too much so now I can't get either :c\n\nI just so happen to have pictures since I was excited and showed a friend, haha. http://imgur.com/a/HApuB","replies":[]}]}
