Your resolution settings may be too high, so it may be necessary to reduce your monitor and in-game resolution, as well as trying to run in fullscreen mode.  Also, make sure that your graphics drivers are up to date so it's rendering the game properly.  Steps for that can be found in our [FPS issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting) guide.  Hope that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"Free Pillows","date":"2016-08-17T20:40:17.423+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thanks for the reply although i have had this monitor  for about 2 years now and played league ... i just recently fixed a problem where i would bugs splat at the post game screen.. my game runs above adv. except for this small problem now","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-17T20:47:33.561+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the extra info, that's helped a lot!
