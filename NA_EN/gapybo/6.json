The female figure on the branch is almost certainly Quiyana considering the haircut and visible crown silhouette, she looks very short. This would explain why her proportions seem a bit off in her teaser, especially the thighs.\nOr maybe she is just a kid in the teaser, but why would a kid wear a crown?","replies":[{"poster":"Reav3","date":"2019-06-07T17:09:19.751+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"No, she is just very short","replies":[{"poster":"Gapybo","date":"2019-06-07T17:25:07.473+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cool, so she is still a human like Lux?
