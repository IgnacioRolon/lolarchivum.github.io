There has been so much feedback that could easily make this one of the best skin lines out there. For example, I know there has been an overwhelming consensus (excluding the few blind fanboys here and there) that PROJECT Leona is extremely underwhelming in both look and effects on her abilities. Look to the link below just to see a sample of this reaction from your community.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/3hv5gn/project_leona_is_an_incredibly_disappointing_skin/\n\nI have to agree with most everything those people said in the comments. PROJECT Leona would have been an instabuy for me, but I will have to pass if things stand as you say. Not even the \"First Strike\" loading screen cards is enough to change that. If Riot listens to the community and improve this skin, then yes, I will gladly buy.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shénzhì","date":"2015-08-25T20:41:30.846+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"r.i.p **:(**\nhttp://41.media.tumblr.com/7aee83702a5cbb490aeb51cb1c21ae0b/tumblr_naoo86fY311tamct5o4_400.jpg\n\n\n* No special loading screen.\n* No special summoner icon.\n\nAm I wrong?\n\n___\n\nAnd why are Mecha skins excluded from the 'minion augment / augminion' activation?\nPlease.

However, the icon I'm curious as to why not make it (PROJECT Yasuo) a purchasable one if the others aren't? Keeps the line nice and clean (minus border), and everybody can represent their favourite PROJECT skin.
