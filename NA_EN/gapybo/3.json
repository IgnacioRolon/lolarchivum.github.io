The skin always seemed like it never got the full texture pass. It&#039;s blurry and gold pieces look off (not talking about translucent clothes). Even the new Irelia skin who has an older model than Karma looks more polished. I wish they were brought more in line.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-06-01T17:28:43.789+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"Hey Gapybo,\n\nAt this time, we don't have plans to update Order of the Lotus Karma.","replies":[{"poster":"Eyrgos","date":"2015-06-01T18:41:32.291+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot KateyKhaos,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=9i2Ta34O,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-06-01T17:28:43.789+0000)\n>\n> Hey Gapybo,\n> \n> At this time, we don't have plans to update Order of the Lotus Karma.\n\nMake them please.

He's right about the poor texturing.\n\nNot only that, I'm mostly referring to all the no's with regards to skins on PBE.\n\nLook at your post history... you guys reject so freaking much, it just feels like your team doesn't give a flying hoot about player wants.\n\nAnd about these other skins that are 'more' in need of a visual update... are any actually being visually updated?\n\nMagnificent Twisted Fate for instance, a nearly $20 skin under the Legendary Tier.\n\nYes, I've heard it before... we have no plans, he is as he was when shipped under that price point & we have no plans to update his pricing or bring the skin in-line with others of its kind.\n\nSo just tell us, what skins are being visually updated then? Any? When? Soon(tm) is getting really old when we have virtually nothing to show for all the soon(tm)'s years later.\n\nWhat of the promised Quinn MTU/TU that was supposed to be expedited over two years ago now due to her being rushed in the Art Dept.?\n\nWhere is that? I'm salty over this subject because I spent those two years rigorously seeking follow through on this to turn up nothing.\n\nStill waiting on IronStylus to respond.","replies":[{"poster":"Malzahard Mode","date":"2015-06-02T00:45:38.964+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Skins that are being updated a mainly going to be those in line with Champion Visual Updates and texture Updates,  for example, all of the Tristana skins got polished up when the changed her model.
