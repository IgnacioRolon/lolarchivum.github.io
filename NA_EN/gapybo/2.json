Her gameplay rework was canceled if I&#039;m not mistaken. Does that mean she is now also open for new skins? \r\nI don&#039;t need any details but please tell me if she is considered as a champion who can get new skins? She is my favorite champion and it&#039;s sad she has no skins with some new effects and only has her release ones available after such a long time.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-06-24T22:37:29.300+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hiya! \n\n(I know I'm bringing this thread back from the grave.)\n\nAs Meddler mentioned yesterday, there is an [update](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/BzNct5tV-can-we-get-a-legit-update-on-fioras-rework?comment=0002) coming for Fiora - which includes some art adjustments.  In a similar vein with the Taric rework, you likely won't see a skin for Fiora until the update is complete.","replies":[{"poster":"DwarvenGiant","date":"2015-06-24T22:47:02.362+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know that you're not on team ChampUp, but do you know what scale of art changes is she getting? I mean, only VFX changes for new spells and perhaps animations that include using the dagger for Parry (like you guys wanted to do before she was released but 'didn't have time'), or will it be bigger, in the sense of model changes and more?","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-06-24T23:33:28.367+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm actually not sure what it fully entails.
