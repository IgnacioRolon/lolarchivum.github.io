Chromatic Eagle - you're using my weakness against me!\n\nOn a more serious note, as many of your know, I'm not on the Narrative team, but I do care a lot about the lore and the players.  I just don't have any way to help on this side of things right now.\n\nFor what it's worth, I did write the Tahm Kench 'notes' on the [recipe cards](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/fancreations/u78pishu-the-tahm-kench-cookbook) and I got those approved by Tahm Kench's writer as appropriate for his speaking style.  I know it's not really much at all - but scraps are all I can contribute right now.  Sorry.  :(\n\nI can try to hit up Jaredan and see where he and the gang are at right now, but it'll be up to him (and maybe above his head) whether or not he can surface it right now.","replies":[{"poster":"SpecterVonBaren","date":"2015-08-26T03:55:34.175+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you, you are our **shining beacon** of **light **on the forums in the dark times when we question whether lore trully exists.\n\nhttp://dobrochan.ru/src/png/1102/Phreak_happy-(riot).png","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2015-08-26T03:57:00.665+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SpecterVonBaren,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=miEz1Ng3,comment-id=000300000000,timestamp=2015-08-26T03:55:34.175+0000)\n>\n> Thank you, you are our **shining beacon** of **light **on the forums in the dark times when we question whether lore trully exists.\n> \n> http://dobrochan.ru/src/png/1102/Phreak_happy-(riot).png\n\nPuns of Damage.

I've surmised from your posting style that you mostly browse the Red Tracker and reply to red comments without necessarily examining some of the rest of the thread first - so I imagine you're reading this :)  First, if I may,  a reminder, because I've spotted the pronouns you use for me; I am female.  Further to your other thread, no I haven't been turned into some spokesperson for the lore team - the reason I post is because I'm interested, and I lurk on the Story & Art boards in a lot of my _spare time_.  I'm kept pretty busy in the office otherwise :)  I don't post as much as I lurk, because I usually can't contribute much - not officially anyway.

What have been some of the good, the bad, and the weird surprises that you've learned about us, or the lore?\n\nThank you!  I'm actually an old (oooold) hand at this game-development shenanigans - been a level designer for comfortably over a decade now, and I've been at Riot for around a year and a half.  Happy I've been able to be some use in that time, even if I'm not the best person for the task.\n\nThe Good:\nYou are all SUPER passionate over here, and think through not only factual elements, but the underlying themes and meanings much deeper than I think many other places might give you lot credit for.  I lurk like crazy, and so I do read some of the longer, more in depth, analysis posts that pop up.  As for the lore, it goes deeeeep here.  A game with this much history means I'm learning new stuff about it all the time - which is both great because learning new stuff is brilliant, and terrifying, because if I put my foot in it through ignorance, I know you guys will set me straight ;D\n\nThe Bad:\nThe players have been burnt by some bad experiences with how the story has been handled in many ways - and their reactions are for the most part totally human and understandable.  Not being able to fix that is super frustrating to me.  On the lore specifically, it's a big bag of mad in many ways - which is great and terrifying!  Some parts I can hardly believe is a real part of the game - but there are always some players who LOVE every element, so I need to remember to respect the parts that I think are too weird to exist :)\n\nThe Weird:\nAh, wait.  I think I just talked about that in the bad bit.  Huh.  Well, there's enough weird to go round!  It's weird that Riot talks to players as much as it does (I came from a studio where you'd go internet dark for 5 years, on pain of being fired).  It's weird that they don't talk more!  It's weird that lore goes through so many rounds of approval and stakeholder review.  It's weird that there aren't more ways to make the boundary between official lore and player-lore more porous (I think about that a lot).  I'm kind of weird too.  It's weird that I like being weird.","replies":[{"poster":"Ramuhdo","date":"2015-08-26T23:51:04.281+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> It's weird that there aren't more ways to make the boundary between official lore and player-lore more porous (I think about that a lot).\n\nIs it weird that I read that as \"more Poros\"?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Linna Excel","date":"2015-08-26T23:51:36.093+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">The players have been burnt by some bad experiences with how the story has been handled in many ways\n\nStill waiting for expert swordsman Lissandra instead of ice mage Lissandra...\n\nI don't want to be too hard on y'all as I liked the bilgewater event for the most part, but then again I'm not happy you guys axed the League in the lore, but then again what y'all are doing for the new champs is a lot more than you did for the old champs, but then again...","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"patmax17","date":"2015-08-26T19:19:59.458+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Galadriel <3 <3 <3","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Dreamspitter","date":"2015-08-27T17:04:29.593+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SpecterVonBaren,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=miEz1Ng3,comment-id=000300000000,timestamp=2015-08-26T03:55:34.175+0000)\n>\n> Thank you, you are our **shining beacon** of **light **on the forums in the dark times when we question whether lore trully exists.\n> \n> http://dobrochan.ru/src/png/1102/Phreak_happy-(riot).png\n\nAlmost confused him with\n\nhttp://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/435263/incest-deliverance.jpg?w=720\n\nBilly Redden, the banjo playing kid from Deliverance.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Chromatic Eagle","date":"2015-08-26T04:20:29.297+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"You see?!
