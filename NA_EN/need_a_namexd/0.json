He can play mid if he wants. He wasn't assigned a role. Calling roles is something people do as a courtesy to ensure that every meta role is chosen. It's not a rule that needs to be followed. I recommend ditching the blind pick, or at least not going into it expecting to get the role you want.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2018-04-17T18:48:40.990+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You do realize that call order isn't enforceable in blind pick? \n\nHe really isnt trolling if it's not a rule.","replies":[{"poster":"need a namexD","date":"2018-04-17T19:03:09.547+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"3/12","replies":[{"poster":"Telephone Booth","date":"2018-04-18T01:40:00.872+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=need a namexD,realm=EUNE,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=7r6HPMXl,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2018-04-17T19:03:09.547+0000)\n>\n> 3/12\n\nHe had ABOUT a 0.6 kda. You had a 1.0, Jhin had the worst kda at about a 0.4 or so. Pointing out the score means nothing really. If he trolled, I hope you reported it and it gets detected. But all we can see is a guy play mid and get outplayed, along with pretty much the rest of your team except top lane.","replies":[{"poster":"need a namexD","date":"2018-04-18T06:44:59.750+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well i mean he just went straight bot gave 2 kills then started sharing exp and creeps with me mid again","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"4 Step Cadence","date":"2018-04-17T20:38:58.202+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm more concerned about that Jhin.","replies":[]},{"poster":"archerno1","date":"2018-04-17T20:34:28.499+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How could he know that u are going mid if its blind pick?
