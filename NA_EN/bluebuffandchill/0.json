In other words, you're not even playing the game, you're just running at the enemy and right clicking, and then you're complaining because you can't buy an item that will win the game for you.\n\n> how do we counter a knockup? WE CAN'T!\n\nDodge the tornado/spikes/slingshot/burrow/don't get auto attacked 3 times in a row by an easily peelable melee/etc. As you may notice, they're almost all skillshots, meaning you can move the mouse and click somewhere else and you won't get knocked up. Imagine that.\n\n> HOW DO WE COUNTER HOURGLASS?(SITTING THERE FOR 2.5 SECS ISNT A COUNTER)  WE CAN'T!\n\nHit someone else, then toss a stun his way at 2.51 seconds.\n\n> HOW DO WE COUNTER TRUE DMG? WE CAN'T (HP ISNT A COUNTER)\n\nDodge the skillshots. Counter true damage auto attacks the same way you counter all auto attacks: kite, cc, nuke, disengage (even more so for silver bolts, which even requires 3 uninterrupted auto attacks. If you can't figure out a way to **not get auto attacked 3 times in a row** you don't belong in a competitive game).\n\n> HOW DO WE COUNTER CRITS? WE CAN'T!\n\nSame way you counter all auto attacks: kite, cc, nuke, disengage.\n\n> HOW DO WE COUNTER SUPRESSIONS? lmao\n{{champion:90}} Channelled ability, have your team stun him.\n{{champion:19}} Channelled ability, have your team stun him.\n{{champion:72}} Don't let the slow scorpion with no gap closer get into melee range.","replies":[{"poster":"BlueBuffandChill","date":"2015-01-18T13:10:55.366+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Raptamei","date":"2015-01-18T13:24:01.658+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Zeus42922,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=zcXKflW0,comment-id=00060000,timestamp=2015-01-18T13:10:55.366+0000)\n>\n> * U r a dipshit Vayne has a flash every 3 secs\n\nTotally.\n\n> malzahar insta kills\n\nTotally.\n\n> skarner can flash on you\n\nAnd you can flash/dash/jump/blink away and now he's stuck in your team and dies.\n\n> Darius ults you 383836262 true dmg and has a free ignite\n\nLOL he's complaining about Darius LOL.\n\n> and kiting and disengaging doesn't mean you are magically immune to crits\n\nAuto attacks that don't happen have 0% chance to crit.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"TrentBatNA","date":"2015-01-18T13:35:46.341+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How in the world is Darius, Lissandra, Fiddlesticks, Udyr, Morgana, Xin Zhao, Kalista, and Nasus OP?

He has no skillshots, he's way too easy to play for the amount of damage and cc he has. With red buff you can get a guaranteed 150% gank.","replies":[{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2015-01-18T12:50:01.425+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, Liss is gankable and is definitely a lot easier to gank compared to Ezreal, LB, Fizz, Ahri, Heimerdinger, Syndra, Tryn, Shen, Swain, Kat, Lee Sin... The list goes on really. Many champions are incredible at escaping ganks due to the fact that they have incredible escapes with the exception to a few like Syndra, Heimer, and Swain who simply have perfectly disengage-then-reengage abilities. If Swain lands the W and follows up with a E+Q, the gank is not only over, but now he's getting a free kill off that jungler. Heimer is hilarious because he WANTS you to come near him and with your jungler being melee, they gotta get near his turrets to get near him and thus are taking free damage the entire time. Then there's of course Syndra who can very quickly drop a Q, then E+W+R for an incredibly fast combo that'll kill any non-pure tank jungler early on. If she doesn't have her R yet, well, she can still Q and E them away from her as well as stunning them in the process.\n\nJ4 has incredible mobility, damage, and CC. Pretty harsh kit. Could use some damage reductions.\n\nXin is a ganking jungler and provides nearly nothing to the game if he can't get fed off ganks. Unlike his counterpart J4, he doesn't have a bubble, his CC is a knock up and a knock back. The knock up requires 3 AA's and his knock back only applies to the targets he's NOT hitting with his AA's/E. He's pretty squishy without the bubble or bonus armor J4 has and his damage is heavily reliant on AA's and his gap closer isn't really that big of a range. His E does slow at least and with red, he can keep a target perma-slowed, but he suffers from Squishy Jungler Syndrome and is not a wise choice if the enemy is a Squishy Murderer like Fizz, Renekton, or Syndra. He also hates Heimer turrets. The Donger's turrets after landing that E will make the poor guy cry.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DoraTheBrown","date":"2015-01-18T06:08:39.363+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"dun change my xin zhao plz just make him do most damage","replies":[]},{"poster":"BlueBuffandChill","date":"2015-01-18T06:00:29.013+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Lmao what do you consider  op if you don't think they are. riven can kill you before her stun wears off same goes with liss and her ult","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"UberAffe","date":"2015-01-18T07:21:54.363+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"HOW DO WE COUNTER HOURGLASS?(SITTING THERE FOR 2.5 SECS ISNT A COUNTER) WE CAN'T!\"\nHourglass is a counter to burst champs and burst champs/cc are a counter to it\n\n\"HOW DO WE COUNTER TRUE DMG?
