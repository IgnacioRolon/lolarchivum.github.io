I was wondering if anyone had any solutions. My computer doesn't seem to be overheating, and it used to run league absolutely fine when I last regularly played which was a few months ago.\r\nHowever, it's been getting to every game where I'll get into a game for not even a minute in game before I am forced to force restart my computer.\r\nMy computer is only about a year old; it shouldn't have any problems running the game. I've just redownloaded the entire game to no avail.","replies":[{"poster":"Horse Grenades","date":"2016-09-07T13:41:41.890+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had the same problem with the new Windows 10 update!\n\nif you right click the League application and select \"Test Compatibility\" it will run a diagnostic and fix the problem for you!\n\n:)","replies":[{"poster":"Mimic94","date":"2016-09-08T05:20:54.750+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This seems to have worked so far.
