Mostly Warwick and almost exclusively with Smite. I can't say for sure that you were not just taking Smite into lane, but probably not. \n\nI would say it is far more likely that you were disappointed that you didn't get the jungle role, but chose Warwick top, hoping to force your team to trade position with you. When they wouldn't, you were probably feeding, or at least playing very aggressively. \n\nI of course can't confirm this, but Riot can. \n\nLearn other champions and roles.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Timethief49","date":"2016-09-13T11:07:39.251+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Deserved.
