You may need to share this with your ISP to see why some of those nodes are jumping so high, specifically with hops 11 to 17.  In the meantime, you may be able to try some steps in the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to help, especially focusing on the configuring your DNS section.  That may adjust the route you're taking and find another path.  Hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
