I was using the Heartseeker Oriana skin. The first appeared after I died after just managing to get an E onto an ally. The second seemed to occur when an ally died when I had just gotten an E off on them, though it was a chaotic fight so I could be wrong (I lived, unlike the first one, so definitely a different trigger).\n\nI have screenshots if you need.\n\nEDIT: Thanks to Kristian818 (EUW) for the videos showing this:\n\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report/2jAAEUzg-gameplay-orianna-ball-indicator-multiple-ball-indicators","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-03-14T16:42:15.226+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Ayame Isaki! \n\nThanks for the report!
