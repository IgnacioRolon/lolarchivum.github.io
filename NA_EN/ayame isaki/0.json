This number is reflected by the red circle near the chat icon that you click to go to this pain that contains X as well. Finally, the app icon displays that same number if you have badges enabled (which I do).\n\nFor me, X is currently 5. At the time of the bug report, that number was 2. The thing is, I have no chats at all (I cleared them all as part of my debugging after opening every chat and making sure I read every message failed to clear it).\n\nIt is kind of funny to see &quot;MESSAGES (5)&quot; followed by a sad poro with &quot;You don&#039;t have any messages!&quot;.\n\n**Possible Steps to Reproduce**\n\nFor awhile, I was stuck at 2, and it would increase from there when new messages would come in and then return to 2 when I read them. Last night when I hit 5 as the new &#039;zero&#039;, I took note of exactly what happened.\n\n1. In client (i.e. in game,  not mobile), an individual I had not spoken to in some time messaged me. I responded and had a very brief chat with them (they sent me a total of 3 messages). All were read in client.\n2. About a 1/2 hour after shutting down my client (maybe an hour after the convo ended), my notifications fired on my iPhone that the LoL Chat application had new messages (3 notifications).\n3. Unlocking the phone showed the app icon badge with a value of 5.\n4. Opening the app revealed my conversation I had in client had arrived to my phone (even though they were already read in client).\n5. Opening the conversation did not return the unread count to 2 (which for me has been &quot;zero&quot;).\n6. Clearing the conversation did not return the unread count to 2.\n7. My new zero is now 5.\n\nOther possibly relevant data: My PC and iPhone share the same network.","replies":[{"poster":"ChocChipCookie","date":"2016-03-07T20:36:41.725+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the awesome report along with the detailed steps to repro!
