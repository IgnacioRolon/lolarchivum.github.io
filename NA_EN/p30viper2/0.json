Need help on this issue] Does RiotGames blackmail their customers??","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi all,\r\n\r\nRecently, my account banned without any clear explanation or notifying beforehand. I even couldn't log in to the website. So I created another account to send a ticket and follow up the issue. Just wanted to know that whether someone had this issue and could clear it for me. Here is the communication with the support team:\r\n==========================================\r\nME:\r\n==========================================\r\nDear support team,\r\nServer : EU West\r\nI see a permanent account ban when I try to log in my account. I didn't receive an email explaining the reason. Also, I can't login to website account due to combination error despite the fact that I can retrieve my username and change my password. I tried several times but It doesn't work. I would immensely appreciate if you could follow up this issue or let me know the reason of it.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n==========================================\r\nSupport:\r\n==========================================\r\nHello p30viper,\r\n\r\nThe League of Legends account p30viper has been suspended due to a purchase dispute (a \"chargeback\")made by the associated financial institution. Due to this, Riot Games has refunded payment in the value of 50 EUR (a “chargeback”). This account is unavailable for use until the outstanding balance has been repaid in full to Riot Games.\r\n\r\nYou can find more information on chargebacks here:\r\n\r\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201753334#h3\r\n\r\nPlease note that this chargeback is a violation of our Terms of Use, and any future payment disputes may result in a permanent termination of your account. You can find the relevant details in Section IV of the Terms of Use:\r\n\r\nhttp://leagueoflegends.com/legal/termsofuse\r\n\r\nDepending on bank processing, multiple chargebacks may result in multiple account suspensions.\r\n\r\nPlayer Support Specialist\r\n\r\n\"This stage is beneath my talent, but I shall elevate it.\"\r\n==========================================\r\nME:\r\n==========================================\r\nHello,\r\n\r\nI'm afraid that a mistake might happen. I've never purchased anything from Riot games and didn't use any credit card for this game. As a result, I didn't dispute any charges.\r\nCould you please let me what is the financial institute or the name on the card? Was that my name, ? I don't know how I can prove that I didn't purchase or dispute. I would appreciate if you give me more information and follow up this issue or give a communication way to Riot Games Billing and financial department.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nVahid\r\n==========================================\r\nSupport:\r\n==========================================\r\nHello again,\r\n\r\nI am sorry but I am not able to disclosure any kind of information regarding the chargeback.\r\n\r\nI can only tell you the amount you will have to pay in order to lift the suspension on your account (50 EUR) also I can help you with the payment methods.\r\n\r\nRecently, we developed a new system for handling these repayments automatically and nearly instantly, without waiting 1-2 business days. The tool can be found at: https://repay.leagueoflegends.com\r\n\r\nWe currently only accept Paypal (through which you can use debit and credit cards) and OpenBucks gift cards, including Subway, CVS, and other gift cards. Unfortunately, we don't currently accept prepaid RP cards through this system. If you'd like to use RP cards, you'll still have to undergo the 1-2 day processing period.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you have any other questions or concerns.\r\n==========================================\r\nME:\r\n==========================================\r\nDear Andie,\r\n\r\nI'm saying that I didn't purchase anything and you still require me to pay money to reopen my account instead of helping to understand where this charge has occurred and the source of the mistake.\r\nPlease look up the payment history again, I'm sure there should be a mistake.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nVahid\r\n==========================================\r\nSupport:\r\n==========================================\r\nHello Again,\r\n\r\nWe investigated your case again.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned before, I am sorry but there's nothing we can do at this time. I have explained you everything.\r\n\r\nI explained the reasons, in my previous emails to you.\r\n\r\nPlease consider this case closed, our decision remains final and we will not remove the ban, unless you pay the chargeback.\r\n==========================================\r\nME:\r\n==========================================\r\nHello,\r\n\r\nSorry to hear that. I can't consider this case closed and I think it's not legal to ask money from your customers without any proof. You did not give me any statement and I can't even access my online account to see what happened. You let the players level up and then ban their account and ask them to pay you without providing any more information. That's exactly BLACKMAILING!\r\n==========================================\r\nSupport:\r\n==========================================\r\nHey again,\r\n\r\nIt's not that there isn't any proof, it's that we cannot disclose information about the investigation. I can only stress that in doing so we provide information that could potentially lead to individuals attempting to circumvent our methods of investigation. I've double-checked all of the information and we stand by the results of the investigation.\r\n\r\nBest of luck!","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-08-05T07:26:18.275+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Judging from what you've said it sounds like your account was compromised, they changed your password, and used your account in an RP scam.
