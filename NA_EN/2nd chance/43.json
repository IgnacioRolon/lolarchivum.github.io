Look no further than MagikarpUsedFly's 'Champion Spotlight' videos).\n\nWhat makes this all the more frustrating, and frankly just insulting at this point, are these two points -\n\n* Fortnite (just go with this for example sake ignoring it's infamous nature here) taking **less than a year** to implement their own replay system, that works perfectly fine and having much more options/tools (like a very good camera system with tools such as Field of View, angles and much more) than Riot's VERY frustrating to use replay system.\n* Riot has their own sandbox and camera tools to make their own official high quality trailers for champions and skins, yet won't release these tools to the public. Showing they have these much well designed means with many more tools than the live client replay system has, that content creators desperately could use and would solve the issue at hand, yet deny access of these much more functioning usable tools to everyone. \n\n___\n\nAll in all due to these reasons, one of League's more viewed and enjoyed ways of bringing in more new players and keeping old players around, not to mention being free very well made advertisement for Riot, is declining and slowly fading into obscurity. \n\nPretty big eye opener on a thing not many people know the struggles about if you ask me. So that's why I made this thread in hopes to spread the word about it and help League's video creative content creators.","replies":[]}
