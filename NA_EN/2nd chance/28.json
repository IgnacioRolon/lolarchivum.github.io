'beta' of the Specialist role\n\nA role where I assisted the mod team with certain threads on GD they weren't certain about how to moderate and needed a second opinion from someone who knows the rules of it better. Since GD has more flexible rules and as more moderators were added to the moderation team, less knew about that, causing frustrations for the posters of GD and the moderation team as well\n\nThen after Keyru and Wardens had a talk (kinda assuming here), they decided to change the Ambassador role to the now Specialist role and opened it up to every other board section\n\nSo for me, it was a simple upgrade in a way, getting this shiny new blue name on GD and the Specialist role tag\n\nAt the same time, certain roles like the Archivists and the Advisors also have been removed, and those moderators also have been given Specialists roles for the board sections they know from tons of experience and post in a lot (ex. CaptainMÃ¥rvelous is now a mod all around and a specialist for the 'Story, Art, & Sound' and the 'Concepts & Creations' board sections)\n\n___\n\nHope this helps explain things a bit more!","replies":[]}
