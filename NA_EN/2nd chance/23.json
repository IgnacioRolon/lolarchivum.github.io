Activating it increases the physical and magic damage increase by x1.5 and gives Haunt temporary 10% lifesteal and  10 / 15 / 20 / 25 / 30% attack speed for 3 / 3.5 / 4 / 4.5 / 5 seconds.\n\nhttp://puu.sh/kN2ez/09e82809e2.jpg\n\nE -- Ahri Main Wannabe\nHaunt attempts to copy Ahri&#039;s ultimate badly, dashing a 225 / 260 / 300 distance (able to use twice within a 5 second activation before going on cooldown), fearing any targets hit by it for 1 second because of how anime it looks and dealing  70 / 90 / 110 / 130 / 150 physical damage (+ 50% AD).\n\nhttp://puu.sh/mBQ6R/62b12cdb99.jpg\n\nR -- Summon Norscout\nHaunt places down a wrestling world champion gate upon the map within a 4500 / 5000 / 5500 radius, which summons the indestructible Norscout. Once placed, Norscout taunts all jabroni enemy champions and minions within a 700 radius for 3 seconds. Then Haunt blinks to Norscout&#039;s placed location, where all taunted targets then get knocked up and slammed back down immediately for 300 / 400 / 500 True damage (+4% Enemy Max HP% True Damage, + 20% AD, + 10% AP)  as he finally dismisses his partner in style for another ultimate combo in the future.\n\n----\n\nThis is the part where we usually explain how to play the champion and make you really want to buy the release skin as well, but as you see he&#039;s clearly the best champion in the game, and you&#039;ll most likely find a better way to play him better than I can explain and be instantly hooked to whatever skin we release for him.\n\nSo have fun playing him summone- wait that term got olaf&#039;d... uh... players?... my train of thought got riposted... whatever it works, and remember to do tons of damage!\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/tTa6ZTi.png\n\n######Gratz on master again you glorious bugger you.","replies":[]}
