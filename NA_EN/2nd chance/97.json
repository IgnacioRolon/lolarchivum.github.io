With that in mind, we wanted to make a new playmaking Vanguard that charged headfirst into tough situations and made the enemy team fight on their terms. We also really wanted to make a very self-reliant champion; expect to see a unique new passive that helps them build more than just character.\n\n> Look out for the newest Vanguard, whoâ€™ll be heating up one of the coldest regions in Runeterra.\n\nSo my guess is they're gonna be this tanky/bulky stat-wise Frelijordian champ that uses their horn like a support of sorts to bolster their allies with a blow of that horn before going full squad to fight, and probably will play really nice around team-fighting comps.","replies":[]}
