I can&#039;t remember exactly my age, but it was most likely around 2002~2005, the time frame around when pokemon ruby, sapphire and emerald were released in NA.\n\nI was playing pokemon Ruby and I was in Victory Road. I was just grinding my pokemon at the end of it preparing myself for the Elite 4, I&#039;ve played the other two generations before it so I had some pretty decent experience of what I was doing. Some of my pokemon were fainted, but I didn&#039;t mind, because I could simply go ahead and heal when I needed to and come back.\n\n... but then it happened.\n\nhttp://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/emerald/shiny/golbat.png\n\nThis shiny flashy motha truckin&#039; golbat popped outta nowhere with it&#039;s fancy AF colors and sparkles appeared.\n\nI freaked out! I didn&#039;t know what a shiny pokemon was, I knew it was definitely rare and cool as heck!...\n\n_and I had to catch it or I&#039;d regret it!_\n\nSo I played it carefully and weakened it to halfway or so, because I didn&#039;t want it to faint from a random crit or anything.\n\nThen I looked at what pokeballs I had left...\n\n_... I only had 1 poke ball, 5 great balls, 1 ultra ball and a net ball._\n\nI was in trouble... but I risked it and threw all the pokeballs I had except for that net ball and poke ball.\n\nIt didn&#039;t work.\n\n... So I gambled it and weaken it a lil more down to the just red HP zone, it was defeating the few pokemon I had left and I had to do something.\n\nThen I threw the pokeball.\n\n... It still didn&#039;t work.\n\nI had no choice I thought... I couldn&#039;t rely on a net ball unless it was at it&#039;s lowest low, I didn&#039;t have anything to give it a status effect, and I was almost down to one pokemon.\n\nSo... I attacked it.\n\n...\n\n.....\n\n#... and it fainted.\n\nThen I just sat there for a while... devastated and bitter. I knew I&#039;d never see one again in years.\n\nFinally... I went back... healed... and bought more ultra balls.\n\nThat, was my 1st shiny pokemon experience...\n\n_**AND I&#039;M STILL FRIGGIN&#039; SALTY ABOUT IT!**_\n\n___\n\n**edit: Do not include the shiny Gyarados you get for free in G/S/S or HG/SS**\n\n**edit edit: or the guaranteed shinies in B2/W2 with some of N's pokemon**","replies":[]}
