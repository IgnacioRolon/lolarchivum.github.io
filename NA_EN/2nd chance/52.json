It's kind of what they do.  Especially with how squishy and immobile many ranged poke champions are as a trade off for their range and damage.  If you have to run around as a Lux while battling someone waiting for your E to charge it doesn't make a lot of sense.  Hitting a charged E is supposed to be a risk vs reward, not something you do in every fight.\n\nAll poke champions have a main ability that is a reliable form of poke to be their main damage source.  Ziggs Q, Velkoz W (some people max Q, but W gives two charges and is your wave clear), Taliyah Q, Xerath Q, Lissandra Q, etc etc.  Also, the majority of poke on all the champs is on Q just to make it easy lol.","replies":[{"poster":"C9 Squeeky ","date":"2018-04-06T16:15:52.976+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"What if her passive made enemies blind (blinding light) instead of a mark that deals damage when consumed?
