I had accidentally selected a screen size that was not compatible with my screen and now I have a black screen with sounds. Is there any way of changing this from outside the game?{{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-11T21:55:36.223+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This black screen with sound issue is usually caused by a driver failure, which could indeed have been caused by changing settings.  You should be able to restore your settings and resolution to default by resetting your config.  Keep in mind you'll also lose saved settings like bindings and will have to redo it:\n\n **Log into the game** then hop into **a custom game**. *Alt+Tab* out of the match, then navigate to your League installation folder, which should be in C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\n\nDelete the folder named **Config**\n\nOnce you've deleted the folder, leave the custom match. You'll then want to hop into another custom match to confirm the changes were saved.\n\nHopefully that will fix the black screen issue.  I also recommend [updating your drivers ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting)too just in case!  Hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
