(POLL)","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Miscellaneous","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"So I guess my friend and I just did this out of boredom but we made a bet over which pool party skin was the best, me picking reksai and him picking renekton. (the winner between us gets a $10 Riot card so high stakes guys)  Now we know you guys may not agree with either but were going to put all the skins released out there for you to vote, because were honestly curious to find out which is the publics favorite.  Whichever one is ahead of the other will determine our winner but either way thankyou for taking the time to vote!","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-07-09T16:56:14.038+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"While I helped work on Rek'Sai (which was probably one of my favorite skins to work on ever), I also really, really, really love Lulu's sounds and her giant squid hat. :D","replies":[{"poster":"Annie Mid Pref","date":"2015-07-10T10:03:10.841+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thats awesome you commented on this post and thankyou for your reply!

I think these are some of the coolest skins we've made (buuut I'm also really partial to event skins like Pool Party & Snowdown, haha). \n\nSince you said you really like Rek'Sai in your original post - what do you think of the Tremor Sense sounds/jet ski when you ult? :D","replies":[{"poster":"Annie Mid Pref","date":"2015-07-11T22:58:31.554+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was on the edge of buying him until i saw the ult, its too perfect!

If you could read my most recent post, I slipped up pretty badly with a permanent ban but I remember you replying to my post on here and thought you may be able to look into it.

Your best bet here would be to contact Player Support via a ticket and see if they have additional information they can provide. \n\nThat said, it's rare that permanent bans are reversed, unless there is a mistake on our end with our system.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"FlashnFuse","date":"2015-07-13T16:39:24.892+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pool party lulu has been my favorite since I saw this gif: http://33.media.tumblr.com/da066a4a91b462a94573ed7e04f8caaf/tumblr_nppprn4kkN1r2ymt5o1_1280.gif","replies":[{"poster":"Annie Mid Pref","date":"2015-07-15T05:14:12.125+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Haha thats too perfect","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Vistha Kai","date":"2015-07-10T20:07:13.632+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nuff said\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tG7R338JgqU","replies":[]},{"poster":"lightdragoon88","date":"2015-07-10T20:03:55.263+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Renekton is still my favorite.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Linna Excel","date":"2015-07-10T20:02:42.632+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The only 2 champs on that list I have are Leona and Lulu.
