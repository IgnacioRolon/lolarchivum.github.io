I still found some really cool tactics post but they were buried in all of the posts about gameplay balance, because aforementioned posts get upvoted much more.\r\n\r\nI feel like creating a forum specifically directed towards people who want to share builds and tactics or ask the community gameplay-related questions and another one specifically created for people saying &quot;XY is bad, please fix it&quot; would make the forums overall much more streamlined. It would also give tactics posts a much higher chance to get upvoted and to the front page, so we all can discover new builds and ways of playing the game.\r\n\r\nI would love to make a post about AP Malphite mid/support for example, not only to show off but also to see what people think about it and how I could improve it, but in the end I&#039;m pretty sure that would be of no use because I think no one would actually comment on it.","replies":[{"poster":"Furor Nexis","date":"2017-06-23T20:54:34.667+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think this is a pretty great idea. Most users here use build sites to generate what to use on champions all the time, and something like builds + tactics would be pretty cool.
