Client froze up as a ranked game was about to start, wouldn&#039;t relaunch. After trying everything from legacy client to a restart I accepted my placement dodge and downloaded the repair tool hoping it would be fast. This didn&#039;t pan out so I reinstalled using the tool. Clean install will delete all the league files and download a fresh copy? Sweet. Except league was in the root folder for whatever reason and RIP my entire drive. The only thing that didn&#039;t get erased was steam as it was launched and in use, but my entire steam library and myriad of other programs are gone. \n\nI could recover everything as recuva sees it all BUT the new fresh league install overwrote way way too many files for that to be a viable option.\n\nLesson learned, never install a program to your root folder.","replies":[{"poster":"Prynce","date":"2017-03-20T03:46:54.083+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"I guess you got to the \"root\" of the problem.","replies":[{"poster":"elduris","date":"2017-03-20T03:51:30.118+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}}","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2017-03-20T04:12:20.987+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://i.gyazo.com/70f6fe4ab8d0d5f370517d3a105c7780.png","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"hi im jakk","date":"2017-03-20T04:34:23.664+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"PaladinNO","date":"2017-03-20T19:58:38.193+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is why one keep a dedicated SSD to install games on.
