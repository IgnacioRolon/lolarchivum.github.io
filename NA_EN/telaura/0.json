When the servers were moved to Chicago my ping doubled but I made the best I could of it.  Slowly over the months since it has now tripled from what it was and in some cases is 4x higher :(  \r\n\r\nWhen I play from work my ping is pretty stable and about 50-60ms which is perfect but home I am sitting at anywhere from 80-120 and it seemingly changes from day to day :( \r\n\r\nMy work is probably routing me through the east coast as all our traffic seems to go that way ( even our work computers think were in Toronto ) even though were in BC.  \r\n\r\nOptions to test this? I assume that Shaw is just using a crap route from my house to the Chicago DC's.","replies":[{"poster":"Telaura","date":"2016-08-03T19:29:28.428+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Haro ?
