You can spam click it as much as you like but it does not go towards the 3rd stage of selecting a skin. All the other options work (the snowball icon option worked as well as the &quot;send a mystery gift&quot;)\nI would be nice to have this resolved before Snowday Syndra {{champion:134}} goes off special (as that&#039;s what my brother and  I got the RP for!)\n\nSteps on how to reproduce the bug:\n1) Click on the store\n2) Select Gifting Center \n3) Select the friend you wish to send a gift to\n4) Press on the option that says \"Unlock a skin for a friend\" \n\nExpected result: You go to stage 3 where you choose what skin to send\nActual result: Nothing happens at all, no matter how long you wait\nFrequency: 100% \n\nThanks","replies":[{"poster":"Onii Chan","date":"2015-12-10T12:05:40.773+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bugs are always pests, can't even gift anyone.
