I would imagine cc heavy top and support and probably ap mid (Fizz maybe) and a multi-purposed ADC(Ezreal or Corki). Besides that, I would like to know your thoughts and opinions about this because breaking meta yet discovering and improving new method would keep this format of games interesting.","replies":[{"poster":"InsaneSamurai","date":"2015-01-06T00:26:26.852+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I find it works really well with a semi mobile adc, and like you said, cc.  The best part about having extra cc is it makes setting up lockdowns with the condemn becomes much, much easier.  For the adc, Corki or Trist will be able to take maximum advantage of your ganks with dashes, and Jinx creates hell for them once the cc train starts(which she often begins with her own slow).\n\nMid is a hard lane for her to gank if they ward properly(her ult only closes so much distance and there are not many condemn areas, and she's squishy), so someone who can do well without much assistance would be best there.  If they have reliable cc, however, it becomes doable without too much risk.\n\nTop seems like a toss up.  I haven't had the same top laner twice so far with her, but basically anyone with decent cc and some tankiness should work well enough with her. \n\nI think the biggest thing that gets overlooked when playing an odd squishy jungler is that the team needs some initiation/tankiness elsewhere.","replies":[{"poster":"Majidesuka","date":"2015-01-06T00:34:14.195+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I guess an alternative for Mid laners would be Anivia with it's wall/condemn combo, but there needs to be a good level of synergy.","replies":[{"poster":"InsaneSamurai","date":"2015-01-06T00:36:37.860+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good idea :)\n\nAlways like a good Anivia too.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Astrid","date":"2015-01-06T00:32:12.755+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Top/support/mid (one of them) must be a tanky initiator. Having 3 incredibly squishy people on your team leads to a deficiency of people to make up the front line that protects the back line, or there's just top lane/tank support and everyone else behind him -- really not a good idea.\n\nAfter you find your top/support/galio, you need to make sure that your team has enough CC to go around to make up for Vayne's relative lack of it and squishiness. Think of vayne as a really squishy Fiora in teamfights. She doesn't have CC, so bring some of your own to the table.\n\nTL;DR bring a tank and some CC","replies":[]}]}
