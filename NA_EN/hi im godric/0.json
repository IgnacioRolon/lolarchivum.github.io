This falls under \"Show Humility in Victory, and Grace in Defeat\" in the [Summoner's Code](http://gameinfo.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/game-info/get-started/summoners-code/).\n\nIf you don't have anything nice to say, it's best to not say anything at all. On the flip side, if someone is doing well, it's always nice to encourage your team, or even say things like 'well played' to an opponent. \n\n**TL;DR** - It's not cool to say things like \"GG EZ\".","replies":[{"poster":"7ha7guy777","date":"2015-07-27T20:29:33.480+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is negative attitude the correct report option?
