Most the times I can even speak to my team mates. It'll just stay at whoever's turn it was and the count down remains at 0 until I get booted for dodging.

In order to get this fixed, make sure to complete all of the steps found in our [Connection Issues Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664).  There are quite a bit of steps there, but they are all crucial in hopefully resolving this issue.\n\nGive me a heads up if you are still experiencing this issue!","replies":[{"poster":"Sypishocs","date":"2017-07-11T10:50:06.611+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So, I'm just gonna come right out and call bullshit here. I do know that yes, it is a connection issue. Thats why I don't look at facebook or watch youtube while in que, or waiting for the picks to finally get to me. But this 'solution' doesn't stop it from happening. I have had games where I see the timer count down to 0, and I still have to wait almost 5 min to even get the you have been disconnected message. As far as I can tell, when you DO lose connection, the client does not know, it does not try to reestablish a connection. And if it does randomly get the connection back, well there go 6-8 lock in sounds all at once. All we need, because the problem comes from the smallest of momentary lapses in connection (like your connection reroutes) is for it to check to see if this disconnect happened, and if it did, catch the client up. If someone gets fully dc'd it wont be able to catch you up. But right now, the chat system will still work, but champ select doesn't.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kobold","date":"2016-05-26T21:36:57.435+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"since I have a semi related problem that has occurred recently I would like your imput.\n\nDuring champ select I have had 2 things occur after locking, \n1. the client Freezes (Unable to change runes/masteries/sums) and I close the client immediately and get a dodge\n2. the client Freezes (Unable to change runes/masteries/sums) and I close the client immediately and still am put into the game after i relaunch the client thus impeding my team if I was unable to change summoner spells and I am jung (Fill role not auto poping to force smite)","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-05-27T23:02:53.883+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Even though your issue does sound different, it does have the same root cause.
