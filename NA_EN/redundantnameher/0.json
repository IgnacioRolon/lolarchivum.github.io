Ive been considering creating a sculpture of my Main: Fizz for a few months now. I have started my sculpture, and when I complete it I want to try to sell it. However, I don't want to cause any like... copyright issues or whatever. Am I able to make a sculpture of a champion and sell it using the names Fizz and League of Legends? Or do I somehow have to make it an \"off brand\" of Fizz and LoL? Id like to give credit to League in my selling process through claim of the characters design and the actual game, however I just don't want to get sued because I wanted to bring my favorite champion to life through my art.\r\n\r\nThank you guys so much!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-06-17T18:13:57.761+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The only recommendation I could offer here is to check out our[ legal jibber jabber ](https://www.riotgames.com/legal-jibber-jabber)page.
