Just looked you up. You play adc and plenty of them are mobile. Illaoi sucks against vayne, she sucks balls against lucain, and jhin should never be in her range of without someone else there to either help him dodge the e or body block it.  \n\nDODGE E AND WIN. IF SHE ULTS THEN USE YOUR MOBILITY OR FLASH TO IMMEDIATLY GET OUT OF HER RANGE.  She can't chase so once ulti wears off just re-engae and kill her.\n\nEdit: lol you lost to illaoi as a teemo, thats pretty funny","replies":[]},{"poster":"MaeDoSan","date":"2017-02-13T14:52:01.550+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"When she came out I would just run away when she ulted ,and then saw her in play for sometime,  maybe now she is resurfacing","replies":[]}]}
