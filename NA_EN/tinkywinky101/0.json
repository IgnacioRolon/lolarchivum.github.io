While it probably won't get you *Banned*, it could definitely land you in a *low-priority queue*, causing you to have to wait a bit before being able to queue for matches. You may want to check in with your Dad before playing League to ensure you have enough time to play a match so you won't have to disconnect again.\n\nIf you have any other questions, please let me know.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AJRA2k16","date":"2017-01-22T03:30:46.580+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If I were you...I would play League whenever you can.If your dad lets you,play.Just find time to play and I think you'll be fine.","replies":[]}]}
