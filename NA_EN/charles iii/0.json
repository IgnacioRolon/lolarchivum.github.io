The only way I've found to actually open the game is to use a black screen fix i found on youtube. Even then though I close the game and same thing. OVER AND OVER AND OVER.

Also, how often do you restart or shut down your computer? I'd definitely recommend giving the ole gal a reboot before diving too deep into troubleshooting.","replies":[{"poster":"Charles III","date":"2016-11-22T22:05:00.875+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes I make sure everything is closed before I try to run it again, and it consistently happens. I restart my computer fairly often. However, even when I tried to uninstall the client and reinstall it I am having the same issue. My PBE client works fine which is strange that that one works and my regular does not.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-22T23:42:03.945+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for providing more context. Since the PBE works fine but the live client does not, I suspect this is caused by a network routing issue, specifically because the servers reside in different geolocations. Our [connection guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) touches on common solutions for this, so I recommend giving the steps within it a go.\n\nLet me know if this caused any change.","replies":[{"poster":"Charles III","date":"2016-11-23T04:05:46.975+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay, I'm not sure it was those that worked. However, I followed a video I found and went into the folder and got rid of the \"last version\" in the RADs and the game config then moved game config back and ran as admin. This fixed the issue (or is right now). \nThank you for your responses, much appreciated","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
