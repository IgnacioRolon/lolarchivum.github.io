Now, I've uninstalled, reinstalled, looked up on YouTube, Google, etc on how to fix crashes, but it seems to pop up every now and then. I have a decent gaming PC, which is good enough to play high resolution settings with no lag for a lot of games.\n\nAt this point it is effecting my account as I get a crash, send the report, try to rejoin, and if it doesn't work successfully on the first try I will need to restart my whole computer;  hoping my team didn't offer a remake because I was disconnected for the time being. Now, I am sitting in a Low Priority Que (10 minutes) for this, and I have no way of fixing the issue, or at least I have not found one.\n\nIf anyone could point me in the right direction, or simply give me a confirmation that I am not the only one struggling with this issue, and it has been addressed will make me feel better.\n\nAlso if there is anyway I can report these issues, so I don't get these penalized on my account for it. It would awesome.\n\nThank you. Have a great day.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-22T21:15:01.326+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Based on this info, it sounds like you're getting bugsplat errors which can be caused by a lot of different factors.  Reinstalling is a good step, but you could have bad drivers or hardware as well.  You should start out with each step of our [game crash](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes+) guide.  This will help rule out possibilities as well as tune up your PC.

If in theory I walk through all of this steps, updating, repairing as needed one by one will this guarantee no more bug splats?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-23T20:15:58.743+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not a guarantee, but incredibly likely.  These steps rule out the most common possibility that are known to cause this.  There is a chance for weird and one of cases, but starting with the basics goes a long way!","replies":[]}]}]}]}
