It was a good choise that darius get those buffs. \nHis Q is now much harder to hit and if u do not hit exatly with the axe than u do not get a heal (so you do not get  a heal all the time -> u must hit the enemie champion with the axe). \nIf he uses his Q he can not do something else. And u see the Q if he wanted to use it. So if u see that darius wanted to use Q why do u not only dodge it? \nU only need to get close to him or out of his range. His axe is the important factor. \nAnd darius now need to get his passive to defeat an enemie. (so he do fokus on hitting the enemie with normal attacks (for the 5 stacks))\n\nSo do try darius out if u think he is so op. Most people say things without knowing something about the champ. and that is a bit sad.\nAnd darius can be counter now much easier atm.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Fckjaxsuo43v3r","date":"2015-09-03T14:30:21.621+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"LOL! Darius lv 9 had 300 base damage with his Q, which few AD champions can tell the same. His AD ratios were insane, and his ult was insane too (true damage) and his passive too. Now he has less BASE damage on Q but it seems he has more than a 100% AD ratio on Q, his passive still deals good damage (physical, which deal true damage cumulated with his armor penetration) AND boosts INSANELY his AD that is basically high for a tanky toplaner, his Q regenerates him for 15% to 30% of his own missing health, that increases fast because he's naturally tanky and his builds are too. He has 2 slows where he had only 1 before, so u can never escape him. if his W kills u, it refunds the entire mana cost, AND it has 50% of the cooldown reducted. His grab didn't really change. is ult has no mana cost at all lv 3 and he can use it again and again and again and again and again and again etc. just by finishing his targets with it (sure he won't engage a full hp guy with his ult...) so he was strong but now he is unbeatable on the top lane, except by some genius who can bait him all the time, avoid the grab all the time, control him all the time, and probably kill him before he gets into the range for his Q and E. Good luck, I think that except Diamond, few people can do it.","replies":[{"poster":"AyRe CoNteMpT","date":"2015-09-04T08:04:53.928+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"yeah, need to actually have brain now to beat him, but since thats not a given for league players, hes considered \"op\" now.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"ÂºOG 22","date":"2015-09-02T10:51:06.892+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"What buffs? hes Q still on a shitty delay, the dmgs now dont nearly reflect the q on patch 5.15. Hes E still doesnt hook at the distance is supposed too and i dont mean the bug where he catches you anyway even if you escape the area. Darius is a lot weaker he is now then 5.15. The ony thing stronger is his passive which means you have to KS a kill with your dunk to activate it because stacking is well LMAO harder then before.\n\nPS- his heal on Q doesnt mean shit cause you can EASILY deny it by well...... simply walk up to him. Simply put if your range walk out of it or if your melee you can just walk into it. Not hard mechanics if you ask me. (there are a shit load of melee champs that can easily escape it like RIVEN, tyrn, jax, jarv, aatrox, ire pretty much all top lane melee) Great buffs","replies":[{"poster":"Fckjaxsuo43v3r","date":"2015-09-02T15:18:53.873+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"i've just played a custom with cho vs my friend ith darius and lv 4 he won 40 dmg with the passive, 200 AD lv 18, so he doesn't even need to buy any AD to have the highest amount of AD of all champions. His Q heals nearly 100 lv 4, without item, and he deals nearly 100 by hit without item with only his passive AND UNDER EXHAUST so he destroys anybody in 1v1 since lv 1 untill lv 18, moreover the ult no cost and can refresh each time u kill with it so u can penta just pressing R at the right moment, and his Q regen is low? 15% missing health means a non idiot player will build 4000 hp fast and with 20% hp (800) will regen about 600-650 hp...very low, yes, thank you OG, go to bed after u finish ur math exercises. Don' forget i told it was a 1v1 (or now i tell it) and with each champ in the Q he regens 15% if I've understood, so each champ gives him 600 hp when he uses Q at 800 hp when he has a total 4000 hp (don't tell me it's hard when u do a 10/2/6 approximately in an average game with average teams with about 150 farm at 30-35 minutes).\n\nDarius can now EASILY be the TANKIEST AND STRONGEST CHAMP OF EVERY SINGLE GAME YOU WILL PLAY FOR THE NEXT 3 MONTHS UNTILL RIOT DECIDES TO NEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEERF THAT STUPID CHAMPION PLAYABLE BY A LV 15 AGAINST A LV30 GOLD. Come back in 1 week and tell me how you love the axe you took in your butt the whole week...\n\nGood bye, I think people won't see me in lol for a long time. Because of Riot's dumb priorities that make no sense.\n\nOh, I've forgotten Elise. 2 years I've wanted to play her. July, she gets upped, I play her once dominion and get 19/7/12, then I go for 1 month where I have no connection, then I come back, she has been nerfed again, now she doesn't anymore put 8% actual hp but only 4 ridiculous %. Thank you Riot, put it deeper in our poor asses. More cheated unskilled champions, less good skilled champions.
