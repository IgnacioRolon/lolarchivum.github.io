He is also a very good early/mid game poke champ.\n\nJinx is a late game hypercarry, not really comperable to ez. Ez is also very safe compared to most adc's with his e.\n\nHis ult does a ton of damage too, you just have to make sure not to hit any minions with it first, each thing hit lowers its damage by 8% I think it was? Down to 30%.","replies":[{"poster":"GastonBarnacles","date":"2016-10-16T10:33:36.193+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Minions block his poke.","replies":[{"poster":"Comrade Guylas","date":"2016-10-16T10:51:52.981+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You sir, are a potato","replies":[]},{"poster":"ZephyrDrake","date":"2016-10-16T11:40:40.870+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=GastonBarnacles,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=wQPWUXFG,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2016-10-16T10:33:36.193+0000)\n>\n> Minions block his poke.\n\nso? you don't need to land his Q on a champion to get the CD reduction, all you need is to have your Q land onto something.
