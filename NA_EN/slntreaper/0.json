Ok, why did that happen?  Apparently she was &quot;playing with a lower level friend.&quot;  Mind you, she&#039;s gold, and I&#039;m not even ranked yet.  So I ask her, why are you smurfing by playing with a lower level person?  Then someone on the enemy team calls me &quot;mentally retarded.&quot; ??? The game got pretty ugly, and it ended up in the entire game reporting me.  I don&#039;t know why, I just was asking over and over, why u smurf?  They were the ones that said I &quot;needed help.&quot;  Why does this happen?  And why is the community so frickin&#039; toxic?","replies":[{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2016-09-05T19:58:17.394+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Delivery is important. You can try asking it like \"curiosity question: why do you smurf?\", instead of saying \"why you smurfing?\"\n\nPeople are defensive in their nature and don't like to be attacked, if Janna already said that they are playing with their friend, then that's what they are doing. Your further questioning puts them on a defense. \n\nWhile i don't have full details of your chat, it doesn't sound like Janna was smurfing, and i might need you to define smurfing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AraMoOse","date":"2016-09-05T19:49:44.399+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SlntReaper,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=rvYs0mF3,comment-id=,timestamp=2016-09-05T19:47:02.527+0000)\n> I just was asking over and over, why u smurf?  \n\nI think the problem has to do with the \"over and over\".\n\nPeople are allowed to queue with their friends.","replies":[{"poster":"SlntReaper","date":"2016-09-05T19:51:25.207+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"But not when it becomes a gold pubstomping a bunch of noobs.
