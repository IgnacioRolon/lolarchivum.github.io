LoL at 95 FPS med graphics).  Recently I began to notice my 4gb laptop sitting at very high ram usage all of the time (and hitting max ram usage caused horrible frame drops (avg frame rate was much lower too 56ish)).  I started to wonder what was going on, so as anyone with a problem would do I started to search for answers.  I pulled up control panel to see my computer sitting over 60% memory usage with no apps or any programs open (aside from the ones that are open at startup).  This seemed oddly high so I gathered as much information I could before I began to start looking into all my programs to see if there was an issue.  I also scanned the memory for any issues.  After coming up empty I decided to just look around.  \n\nAfter a day of use and closing everything.\n\nhttp://i67.tinypic.com/316ubmb.png\n\nSo now I was sure something was up so I tried a few things and eventually ended up re-booting to get these results.\n\nhttp://i66.tinypic.com/i405co.png\n\nSo I recalled reading that LoL is coded using C++ (could be wrong) so this led me to think it might be a memory leak caused by league.  So with the lowered usage, I went into a custom game to try and monitor performance.  I was getting better frames and never once hit max usage! \n\n(I do not have a screenshot of this so I guess take my word for it :) never hit above 86%)\n\nNow for the interesting part... I closed out of my client to see if maybe League of Legends was not freeing up unneeded ram (Once again could very well be wrong).  And... it started dropping down on the usage before stopping at 60ish%.  \n\nhttp://i66.tinypic.com/wi4umr.png\n\nNow I am by no means an expert on anything.  So here I am asking a few things...\n\n1. Is this a memory leak\n2. If it is a memory leak is League of Legends the cause\n3. If LoL is the cause then how should I go about fixing it?\n\nThanks for any help or thoughts ;)\n\n**[NAME REDACTED]**","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-14T02:43:51.689+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Typically a memory leak is where your memory usage continues to rise as the program continues to run normally or sit idly. So in this instance, it *doesn't* look like a memory leak, especially because most of your memory usage was by the Windows system itself.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions.","replies":[{"poster":"Krispy Juniors","date":"2016-10-14T12:06:56.025+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alright.  I would like to start by saying thank you for help.  So I guess if I do have a memory leak, then it is likely caused by a Windows program.  Or maybe just something else entirely.  Once again I appreciate the help.","replies":[]}]}]}
