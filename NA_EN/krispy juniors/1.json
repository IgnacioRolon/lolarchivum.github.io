This issue has been regularly occurring for the last few days. Due to this issue, I have been forced into unwillingly dodging two times today. This has resulted in me having to wait 30 minutes to re-queue and the loss of about 15 LP. If it were not nearing the end of the season I would not mind this issue nearly as much. I am trying my hardest to reach Gold V this season, but due to this issue I feel as though I will be unable to make it.\r\n\r\nWhen I disconnect, my internet connection remains good and it only seems to happen when I get out of a game or after I try to enter champion select.\r\n\r\nI am unsure of why this issue is occurring so any help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"Meldrey","date":"2016-10-23T02:35:01.501+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"You mean you too have fallen victim to the Revolving Door of Technical Problem Punishment?\n\nSo have I!\n\nI don't know what grand update happened, but in one game my alt key seemed locked.
