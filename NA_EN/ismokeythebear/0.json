I recently purchased a new gaming laptop but League keeps freezing every other game. My only option is to hard reboot or use task manager. \r\n\r\nMy drivers are up to date. \r\nI monitored my temp 70Â° C for both my GPU and CPU\r\nI tried unistalling League to have it run on my SSD and HDD\r\nDisabling Xbox DVR \r\n\r\nMy specs:\r\ni7-6700 HQ\r\nGtx 1060 6gb\r\n16gb Ram \r\n\r\nEveryother game runs smoothly (Overwatch/Fallout) so I dont believe its a hardware issue. \r\nAny tips/advice will ne greatly appreciated since Ive had this problem for weeks :(\r\nAlso I get 100-140 fps on medium high.
