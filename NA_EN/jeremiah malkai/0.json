Being on a team with someone that gets an S rank hasn&#039;t worked. She&#039;s just permanently stuck at &quot;4 Chests Available&quot;.

I don't have a main champ or role, so I have no idea what champs I have chests on and which I don't.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot MoreChrono","date":"2016-04-26T18:20:17.848+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yep, just like Randomonium described, there is a border around the champions on the Champions page.

One of them was even a gemstone I converted into a chest and key (because I don't really enjoy playing Annie) I can't tell though, because I don't know the essence values by heart and maybe there are more than just a champion and 2 skins in there, but I'm not sure.

You or the people in your pre-made queue need to earn an S, S- or an S+ rank with their champion. You can only earn one chest per unique champion you get a chest with. There will be a unique boarder around the champion you already got a chest with in the champions tab in the client. Once you earned a chest with one champion, you can no longer earn another with that champ until it resets every year. To be clear, There isn't a chance to get the chest like with keys.
