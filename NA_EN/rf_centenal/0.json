From this, I went ahead and performed an investigation, and I can assure you that you were not \"accidentally\" banned, but were suspended due to recent transactions with League of Legends.  The best step at this moment is to create a new Support Ticket as linked above.  We should be able to explain the full situation to you!  ^.^","replies":[{"poster":"RF Centenal","date":"2014-02-04T03:15:46.324+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thank you, and i sent one","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
