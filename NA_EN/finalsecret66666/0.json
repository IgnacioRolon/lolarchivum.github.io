It happens almost every game. After the game has started everything goes smoothly until about 30s-90s of the game - no matter if its start of the match or Im reconnecting again. Then, suddenly I've got a sound glitch like in Matrix and the game just goes frozen. Cant move cursor, keys doesnt work, simply I'm losing control and pc goes dead like that. No black screen, just frozen. \n\nNo ANY other problems with ANY other games. I've got Windows10, GeforceGTX960, 8GM ram, plenty of space on disc. My pc config should (and did before) run this game on max details on max resolution with 100+ fps (and did before the problem, like 2 months ago).\n\nThings I tried:\n- Reinstall whole windows, fresh DirectX, .net framework, game client\n- Update clean fresh Nvidia drivers (using nvidia experience)\n- Change resolution, details, etc.\n- Turned off xbox recording tool\n\nHave no idea. Any clues, possibilities, anyone?","replies":[{"poster":"finalsecret66666","date":"2017-04-11T22:16:44.649+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did full check in patcher, did try to look for hard disc issues (disc analisys for errors + defragmentation).
