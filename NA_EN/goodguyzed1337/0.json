A new skin for him!","subforum":"Concepts & Creations","up_votes":3,"down_votes":11,"body":"So what about the Zed rework/retexure? I mean, he&#039;s older than Zac and Zac get&#039;s four skins. Come on.. WE Have waited LONG enough for a Zed retexure and a new skin for him. I just watched Big Hero 6 and &quot;Wasabi&quot; Had kinda like Zed&#039;s daggers/Swords And &quot;Gogo&quot; Had her Circle Flat rings that looks like Zed&#039;s Q, MAYBE you can Take THAT Q Model and do SOMETHING about it, because i was thinking of that when i was done watching the movie. BUT WAIT! Theres more! I saw &quot;The guy in the MASK&quot; Had a Zed like mask and i thought you guy&#039;s could fix that. For me, and MANY Other players THAT wouldve been awesome. Oh yeah, if that Zed chroma pack comes out, Make sure to give his animations some VFX Change, like his E &quot;Shadow Slash&quot; &gt; Shows a red/crimson VFX On the lightning when he spins. And his W VFX Could be a Darkish/Crimson Shadow. Just my thoughts about it. Sorry for the English. Im from EUW And i live in Sweden, this is just my NA Account so i could play with my friends ^^ PLEASE Riot. THINK About this IDEA for ONCE. And im done here, names Robin. c: Oh yeah, im also a  {{champion:238}} main.","replies":[{"poster":"TheRealZedShady","date":"2015-07-09T17:34:26.736+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Please not  a bat...or anything ghost/Harrowing related matter...seriously please.

If so it would be REALLY awesome. But there are quite some custom skins for Zed that look like theyre made by you guys, For example \"Mecha Zed\" The animation of it was like made from your animations. Anyways, about Zed. I've mained him since early 2014, I've used Shockblade quite a long time and the SKT one aswell, BUT you could atleast retexure him a bit, He's old, but when i heard the chromas were coming for him i got excited. ^^ But im thankful for that you show him some love for once ;_;","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-07-08T23:33:20.418+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's been discussion around the shadows, but nothing has been decided upon.\n\nThere are some really cool concepts for Zed out there - we actually keep a collection of fan concepts! \n\nAt the moment, we don't have plans to re-texture Zed or any of his skins.","replies":[{"poster":"GoodGuyZed1337","date":"2015-07-09T03:26:44.013+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well can there be any VFX Change in Zeds chroma pack? :o","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-07-09T16:58:09.230+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Speaking for chromas as a whole, generally, no, but we’re looking into this with some champions and skins where it makes the most sense.
