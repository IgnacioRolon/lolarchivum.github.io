And, through Kayn&#039;s lines, we know the Dark Stars are linked with the Odyssey verse through Rhaast. Then I remembered [Jarvan had a Dark Star skin](https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/page/new-epic-skin-dark-star-jarvan-iv) with the following lore snippet:\n\n> A mortal emperor unbound by the destruction of his world, Jarvan&#039;s essence has since been reforged by the ageless energies of deep space. His humanity and his people now lost forever, he stands ready to welcome the Dark Star incursion, in the final subjugation of all existence.\n\nThis snippet mentions Dark Star Jarvan was once a mortal emperor now reborn as a Dark Star corruptant AND that he stands to welcome the Dark Star into his reality, as if they are not all already there. Now we know Rhaast is the only Dark Star there at current and he wants to cause havoc before he opens the gate to let the others through (or something along those lines). That, and by pure observation and assumptions, it looks like Dark Star Jarvan has a &#039;burst out&#039; wound in his chest almost like Kayn/Rhaast had used their ultimate on him.\n\nSo my question is, would it be reasonable to assuming the Emperor Jarvan mentioned in Odyssey Kayn&#039;s lore later becomes a Dark Star due to Kayn&#039;s actions? And, if so, can we expect to see any Dark Star Jarvan and Odyssey Kayn stuff in the future?","replies":[{"poster":"Carnival Knights","date":"2018-09-24T20:07:17.248+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"that, detective\n\nis the right question","replies":[{"poster":"BaWsMaNn","date":"2018-09-24T21:26:35.466+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Carnival Knights,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=bl6eEUc9,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2018-09-24T20:07:17.248+0000)\n>\n> that, detective\n> \n> is the right question\n\nSo my assumptions of:\n\n> [{quoted}](name=BaWsMaNn,realm=OCE,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=bl6eEUc9,comment-id=,timestamp=2018-09-24T08:37:38.245+0000)\n\n> So my question is, would it be reasonable to assuming the Emperor Jarvan mentioned in Odyssey Kayn's lore later becomes a Dark Star due to Kayn's actions?

Or is this universe set before the \"humanity and his people lost forever\" debacle that led to him becoming Dark Star J4?\n\nI could only find this as a response:\n\n> Jarvan is just a mortal emperor doing Mortal Emperor Stuff, and Kayn starts actively disobeying him the minute he picks up the scythe. Dude has no idea what a Dark Star is... we do because, obviously, we have Player Knowledge. They do not.\n\nWhich unfortunately only actually gives us an answer on the first question. I do hope a rioter sees this and clears it up, I'd love to know!\n\n(ps. i love the name)","replies":[{"poster":"ChunLii","date":"2018-09-24T12:15:58.217+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks and you’re right but the fact that Carnival Knights didn’t give a clear cut answer as to if the two were linked makes me think they’re not or that it’s a spoiler for a future skin storyline.
