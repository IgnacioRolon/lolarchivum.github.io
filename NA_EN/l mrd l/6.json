GA reads exactly this \"Upon taking lethal damage enter stasis for 4 seconds(twice the time Zhonya's allows.) after that time restore 50% of base HP and 30% of base Mana.\" No matter how low you were before GA popped, you'll end up at 50% so you get to heal, and avoid all damage for 4 seconds.\n\nMeanwhile Zhonya's costs 100 more, only allows for 2.5 seconds of stasis, and requires you to make the decision to use it(this one is a HUGE deal.). Having to make the decision to use something is GIGANTIC because with GA if an assassin tries to kill you, you dont have to react at all, even if the assassin played it perfectly, you revive for free.
