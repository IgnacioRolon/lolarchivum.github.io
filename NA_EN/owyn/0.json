The removal of his old w basically murders the reason i used to play Galio.  Now, I grant you that I simply chose him as a Brand counter...

With his new playstyle you actually DEFEND people. You're actually doing what he was intended to do. I don't see how that's destroying the character, they actually made him what he was intended to be in his bio.","replies":[]},{"poster":"53436278DEL1","date":"2017-03-08T17:48:00.988+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ill miss that old w heal .... the trollyness I used to do with it","replies":[]},{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2017-03-08T16:40:27.177+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're right, because galio had a huge fanbase outside urf/aram.","replies":[{"poster":"vladerag","date":"2017-03-08T16:42:04.036+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"there was me...
