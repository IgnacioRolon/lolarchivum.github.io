Poro King is already the worst of the \"alternating\" game modes. But having it be random completely defeats the purpose. More so than ARAM there are champions that are just incredibly weak and some that are over powered. This game mode should have bans and we should be able to pick who we want to play. Otherwise why not just stick with ARAM? \r\n\r\nPlayed my first game of it this season, realized it was random and that was my last game this season. Rotating game modes used to be a fun break to play different champs than you normally play or just have some low stress fun but you guys put zero effort into them these days.","replies":[]}
