Initially the Blood Moon skins according to what is non-existing lore, was based on a festival. Issue here is people are treating the skin as if it's a war type skin which from the splash arts and models do represent that war like presence and is why people prefer a dominant red for presence of power. However, the pose Elise has doesn't feel very war like imo. Seems more patient, peaceful and calm till she becomes an angry spider. This is why I liked the pink in her human form because it trails back to the idea of the Blood Moon Festival. The spider form i could care less what hue of red it looked like, but the red does make the skin seem really dominant and fierce.\n\nMaybe try a mix? Pink human form and red spider form? Or if it comes to her staying red do you think you can try editing Blood Moon Elise with pink hair? I currently don't have the tools, but I'm currently wondering how it would look like.

The best argument for her being a bloodmoon skin would be mask (and human form recall, I guess), but her mask at first glance looks more like a fancy hair-thingy, and when you realize it's a mask, it still doesn't really look like a bloodmoon mask.

With that stated, I was in absolute love with the skin when it was first announced, it reinforced my love for Elise and I started playing her frequently again even though she was hard to use and got WAY better than before. \n\nNow, speaking more on the actual design: I prefer the pink.\n\nThough she looks absolutely stunning in both colors, the pink fits her more and it reinforces that Blood Moon isn't actually just about red. People seem to forget that Blood Moon doesn't actually just correlate with blood (red), but I suppose all the previous designs going for the more masculine Kabuki color of red is to blame. However, with that said — despite the other skins being red, Kalista's has shades of maroon, magenta and purple such as along her waist and armor which could give room for Elise to serve as the \"Blood Moon Queen\" as if she is in some kind of higher rank in lore so she garbs a more elegant color. \n\nTo complete a nice aesthetic, they don't actually all have to be the same color which people seem to not realize with Kalista's design and just seem to complain because Elise is full out pink in her own right. Again, the red is stunning, but these skins are not always going to be played among one another, so that is why I vote to keep the original color that matched so perfectly with Elise, Blood Moon and her particles. I'd rather have this unique colored skin instead of having two red skins and two blue skins for Elise.  Not to mention, the pink spider form is FAR superior to the read. The skin was made to be pink. It matched the tone of the line of skins so well and made Elise stand out like she should.\n\nDespite my reasoning, I respect the designers choices but I do hope you guys in the end, stick with the design you originally had planned out that fit her a lot better than the current coloring. I will without a doubt, buy the skin regardless of the choice in a heartbeat, but I will use it a lot more frequently with the pink color. \n\n{{champion:60}}  Long live The Spider Queen!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Essilyn","date":"2014-11-26T04:02:31.635+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"While I wouldn't mind a color toggling akin to other games like Heroes of the Storm with the option to tint skins to other hues, I am in the camp that thinks Blood Moon skins should be red.\n\nI really do enjoy pink skins, and think that shade of pink definitely looks great on Elise; but I believe it would be better if a new skin was designed for Elise that makes use of that color palette.","replies":[{"poster":"Tamur","date":"2014-11-26T04:20:48.013+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll drink to that (grabs a Graggy ice) cheers (chugs the can) burp pardon me","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sukishoo","date":"2014-11-26T19:06:01.800+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Ooo!

I would prefer pink Elise obviously but i have to be realistic and you guys are probably not going to do that.\n\nTalking about her spider form fyi.\n\nWould there be anyway to have a more pinkish red but still red in a sense but not so overpowering like it is now? She is Elise and she is very seductive so the red she has now doesn't really fit like it does with kalista or thresh lol. Shes suppose to be seductively deadly not just flat out \"I want your blood on my sushi\". I know weird way of putting it but. I think the red should be softened up instead of being such a bold bold red. Like with a Little bit of pink.\n\nAlso have the old spider legs back, the new color legs blue and gold just don't go so well together like the purple and blue with a touch of gold was. There is just way to much gold on the legs in the red version and not enough interesting color. \n\nAlso am i the only one that feels like the thigh high boot or whatever should be on her left leg then the right one? It bother me a little LOL but doesn't make to much of a difference.","replies":[{"poster":"Coochie Cutie","date":"2014-11-27T05:29:59.710+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If we have to stay with the bold red could we at least compromise and make her human form more like the pink version, since that is her seductive side. Also bring back the old spider legs with the purple and blue since i have already made it fairly clear my distaste for the new ones. Its so so bland with the little bit of blue tips and to much gold. Its just blah.\n\nI think i'm just literally repeating what i have already said but i'm just trying to do something i guess lol.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Uberphish","date":"2014-11-27T04:16:21.000+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm curious; would you folks consider having Elise be on /both/ sides of the Blood Moon spectrum?\n\nBy that, I mean that Akali is actually more white than red, with red and other dark colors being most of what covers the other Blood Moon skins. Elise being a transformation champ, it seems like it's a really interesting opportunity to be able to switch her color scheme between Beautiful/Monstrous the way she and her mask do.","replies":[]}]}
