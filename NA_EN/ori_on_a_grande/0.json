I've only built into it on bot games where I just try to see how much money I could get, obviously unchecked through the game. As I rounded the opposite side of the jungle with it, I thought about the upgrade (Calling it that is kind of generous), and just how totally lack-luster it is. A very brief moment speed buff and a small handful of gold that's not anywhere close to worth it if your enemy jungler has......cleared the damn camp. \r\n\r\nI'm not sure how much debate this topic will generate, but Riot could patch away Poachers, and I just wouldn't care.","replies":[]}
