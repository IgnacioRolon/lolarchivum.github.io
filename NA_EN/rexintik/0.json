Why? Because, since the missions finish tomorrow, some, like me, might have to move quickly to complete them.\r\n\r\nTo go into more detail, I've found the proposition of three new mission lines enticing, so I've purchased the Dungeon Pass. As you might know, the Pass also gives you Daily Quests, which just give you 10 Tickets for completing a game each day. It doesn't sound like much, but I've done my math and if I get the quest tonight AND tomorrow, I'll be able to purchase one more Good Orb. Almost...\r\n\r\nOne other thing I'm missing is the 40 Tickets from the final mission of the Brand quest line. The one where you have to win a game with a Brand present. To my misfortune, I soon found out that practically nobody whom I've asked on my server (EUNE) _owns_ Brand, let alone would play him with me. I don't have him, either. So you can imagine how happy I was to see that the latest Blind pick game I've took part in turned out to have a Brand on the enemy team, and then, even moreso, we managed to win that game.\r\n\r\n[Here](http://matchhistory.eune.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/EUN1/1784314895/37256966?tab=overview) is the link to the match record, although I am unaware if it's accessible to people signed in with different accounts. I've attached a link to the screenshot of the game from in-game Match History.\r\n\r\nSo, of course, it was an unpleasant surprise to find missions, well... _not there_. No reward. No post-game notification. No satisfaction. Naturally it irks me to think that I could lose what I've tried to fight for over the past week, and due to a Riot server issue, to boot.\r\n\r\nSo I'd like to know if the missions could be retroactively completed after they come back online, as there is only one hour left of today's Daily Quest, I have no certainty that it will even come back up before midnight, and even if it does, I just might not win my next game. It happens to everyone.\r\n\r\nI'd also like to see if there would be any compensation for this minor inconvenience in case the quests don't become completed.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for a reply.\r\n-RexinTik","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-23T21:33:59.442+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It looks like missions were never actually completely taken down, but I was misinformed and the server status page was updated with incorrect information.
