I know the ult for Ekko says to be put back 4 seconds ago and all that, but isnt the point of nerfing QSS to not remove Zed ult be weird to keep this interaction around?","replies":[{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2016-06-08T22:06:22.076+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ekko's ult makes him untargetable during it, so if he does it when the mark would be applied, it isn't.  If he does it when the damage would be applied, it isn't.  If he does it at some point during the ult but not when it would be applied or do its damage, it should remain applied and do full damage at the end.  Though he will not take damage during his own ult.\n\nEdit: all \"he\"s refer to Ekko","replies":[{"poster":"awdaf","date":"2016-06-08T22:07:21.593+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But it doesn't, thats the thing, Ive played the matchup numerous times, and in the middle of the ult, where you do the damage, ekko can remove the ult by ulting","replies":[{"poster":"Serevas","date":"2016-06-08T22:24:06.139+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think it's removing the ult so much as undoing all the damage you did to him making it ineffective and seeming like it was removed. If you had a video of it or something we could see what's happening, but yeah, that's my theory.","replies":[{"poster":"awdaf","date":"2016-06-08T23:02:12.339+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, it literally just takes the mark off","replies":[{"poster":"Serevas","date":"2016-06-09T22:06:34.568+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's really strange, because it doesn't revert ignite or anything like that, it'll still tick on you if you ult.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
