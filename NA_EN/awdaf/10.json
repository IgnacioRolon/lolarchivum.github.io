You can win games by not winning your lane, but then an ally needs to win their lane. Someone on the map is going to win lane, so if it's never going to be you, you're putting your team at a disadvantage. There are exceptions (late game champions like Ryze may be okay going even in lane and carrying late despite an ally losing lane) but overall you need to do something to win your games. The other big thing is that in low elo people make a LOT of mistakes. If your lane opponent is still going for CS when he's in kill-able range at bronze/silver elo he probably just doesn't realize you're capable of killing him from there. If he does it at diamond-challenger elo he's got his jungler nearby and is ready to turn your attempted solo kill in to a successful gank. Basically, going for an out-of-position player at bronze-silver may be a 67% play (only 1/3 chance jungler is near their lane), whereas going for it at diamond+ may be a 5% play (there's no way he got to that elo and doesn't know he should have recalled there). \n\nAt medium elo you get to a really weird balance here. Player still make the same mistakes, and they also don't necessarily stop making them once you've killed them once or twice. It won't be quite as successful a play as in low elo because the jungler also is a little smarter and can see you're getting an edge in your lane and he needs to help out. That 67% play may be a 50% play in medium elo, maybe slightly higher with decent wards. Depending on who you're playing (e.g.  lane bully that wants to get ahead early) it may still be the right play. Big thing to watch for here is a change in behavior in laning phase. If you're bullying lane and they suddenly go for CS with a lot more confidence, the jungler is probably there. If they're still trying to get cs using abilities from range and not getting in a danger zone, going for that tower dive may be more likely to work out. People will still overstay (e.g. needs 120g for a BF Sword, or TP is back up in 25 seconds) but they won't make gross errors like in low elo.\n\nAs alluded to earlier, high elo these mistakes simply aren't made. The player is baiting you. Hence the game focuses on CS and waiting for jungle pressure.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jerry SeinfeId","date":"2017-01-01T18:43:03.405+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"honestly this depends on your champion and depending on your champ it might even change according to your mastery.\n\nWhen i play {{champion:17}} with Deathfire i might be able to win if i go even in kills, still gonna need to \"win my lane\" by having more cs. \nIf i play using Thunderlords, i better kill my enemy at lvl 2 because it would have been a waste taking it if i didn't.\nAnd even then it's probably because of the build i use for him, if you play full ap it might be different too.\n\n{{champion:17}} is such a good example for these things.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AtheosisX","date":"2017-01-01T17:23:58.593+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately the \"I must carry\" mentality that nearly everyone plays with prevents people from sitting back and accepting that they are behind, being outplayed, or simply in a bad matchup.","replies":[{"poster":"GiantEnemyShaco","date":"2017-01-01T23:18:30.362+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's just the natural product of the soloqueue environment.

Playing safe in farming might be a solid strategy in high elo but you need to snowball in low elo.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Weasel Kensei","date":"2017-01-01T21:34:56.723+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You are correct OP.\n\nId like to add a note to some top lane fighter/tank players.\n\nIf you are losing hard to the enemy laner... why are you still trying to rush your damage item? STOP! Get a mid tier defensive item:\n\n{{item:1057}} {{item:3211}} {{item:1031}} {{item:1011}} \n\nat minimum before going back to your damage item, though finishing one of these into a resistance item will keep you in lane longer and get you the CS the OP was talking about. If youre determined to go back to damage after one of those mid tier items, go {{item:3053}} or {{item:3156}} because they will save you from burst, but still give you some hitting power.\n\nIf youre REALLY losing lane stop all items and immediately start {{item:3512}}. Hopefully you will finish it just before the top tower falls and it will help to keep your inner tower standing even if you die.\n\nThe name of the game is getting CS, and sometimes you have to change up your style to play that game.\n\nGood advice OP, upvote!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Big Lincoln","date":"2017-01-01T17:09:15.450+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"but i want to fight {{champion:122}} \n\nIt's all I play top lane for, endless 1v1","replies":[]},{"poster":"JerulEon","date":"2017-01-02T02:01:05.946+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh.
