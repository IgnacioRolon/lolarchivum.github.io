I play off meta all the time. I always talk to my team about it before hand so they know that I'm not trolling. It's not difficult to do, and it works fine that way.\n\nNot communicating about it should be considered punishable, albeit more lightly than taunting in chat would warrant.\n\nLastly, trolls who decide to act out after the game starts aren't going to be detected during champion select most of the time anyway. If they are going to troll they most certainly won't want their temmates to know in time to escape by dodging, they would rather wait until those teammates are trapped with them for the next 20 minutes.
