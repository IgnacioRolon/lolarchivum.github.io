It might be a little bit longer, but i'd think 4 more bans is worth it.  I know the concern now, what about people worried about bans of the champs they want to play? A work-around is when you queue up for your roles, you could have the champion screen pop up and you would select the champion you want to play for the selected roles. That way, you're loaded in with who you have in mind, and everyone can see it.\n\n>If you just keep increasing bans, at some point it gets silly (30 bans?)\n\nI wish Riot would stop using this argument. It's not going to be a slippery slope - all we're asking for is that the last two members of each team  have an option to ban someone they don't want to see in their game.  The argument made on one of the podcasts was paraphrased as \"Well, if we give them 4 more, pretty soon, there's gonna be 100\" or something along those lines. It's purposefully over dramatic for the sake of the idea, I get it, but it remains to be a poor argument with the current roster and their kits.  The counter-argument of \"we wouldn't demand more bans if the champions were both balanced and healthy for the game\" works here was well...just something to keep in mind.  Ten is a good even number, and everyone gets to ban one champ - that's about as fair as you can make pick / ban. \n\n>Could shut down some very specialized comps (e.g. protect the Kog)\n\nI thought diversity by means of strategy and strategic banning was something Riot wanted?  \n\n>Could shut down signature picks (e.g. Froggen Anivia, or just the one champ that you really like to main)\n\nShutting down one trick ponies...oh how awful.  It's their fault for not knowing how to play more than two champions. I'll use the game health point again; maybe if the perma banned  were healthy and balanced, those champions wouldn't be banned so much.  As for the pro scene, once again, if it's that important that people in the pro scene don't get banned out (because let's be honest, Riot doesn't want someone in the LCS to be forced onto something they're uncomfortable on because it makes for a cringy viewing for their precious show) then let them have 6 bans and introduce 10 to everyone else. Everybody wins. \n\n\nThe one over-used argument I'm surprised I didn't see was \"If 10 overpowered champions get banned, people will move to the next 10 overpowered champions.\"  It's not going to happen, I can almost guarantee that.  If Riot prides itself in diversity after artificially changing the meta by constantly buffing champs sometimes over the edge and nerfing others out of existence, this will bring _natural_ diversity back into the game. \n\nLet's say junglers are being targetted in a champ select, and your jungler realizes that their current mains are banned, and is forced to reach for pocket picks or to remember champions they used to play like...Olaf? After hesitantly locking him in, the Ashe on the other team is now panicking at the thought of Olaf running her down like an animal, so she needs protection.  The Bard that was about to be picked isn't going to be very useful against an Olaf, but _Tahm_ can save her. Even though he's not meta anymore, he can protect Ashe, and although that's just one example, that game's bot lane is now that much more diverse.\n\nEdit: For the one-trick segment, I should have specified I was talking about FotM abusers claiming that Fiora is their main when tank Fiora was meta or how they mained Ezreal when blue build first started with Elder Lizard.

That being said though Riot can do a better job at diversifying certain roles. For 1 1/2 year now we had the utterly obnoxious reign of Alistar/Braum in pro play and as a support main myself i hated watching pro play. What am i supposed to learn from the best if they dont play the champions i like? Right now we have a much better botlane meta. Karma, Thresh, Janna, Zyra (for the first time since S3 worlds), Braum, Nami (for the first time since S4 worlds, if i might add) are all more viable and picked and i think that the Forbidden Idol changes in 6.13 further allow diversity.\n\nAnother thing i want to add: Yes, some champions are stronger by the numbers but what we call \"meta\" is only 50% made up by champions being flat out stronger than others. The other 50% is player perception. I played Zyra before the MYMU came around and only now i hear her laning phase being called \"obnoxious\".

The new champion team, the champion rework teams, and balance team need to really step up their game when it comes to creating content that's fair and only reasonably frustrating to play against.

Banning someone is a simplest form of not dealing with the problem champion.\nNot all champions are viable as well. So banning this much may not even be necessary.\n\nSure, 10 bans seems intuitive (1 ban per player) and i most certainly don't ban for my own lane.
