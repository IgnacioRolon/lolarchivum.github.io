I can&#039;t say that I am perfect, nor can I say that I should be placed in challenger or masters, but do i think I should be in Diamond 2-3 right now? Yeah, I do. Most of my losses are because of other peoples mistakes, I do make a lot of mistakes myself, but are they game losers? 90% of the time they aren&#039;t. Riot purposely does this.\r\n\r\nThis 50% W/L thing is getting out of hand, if I have an 8 game win streak, you better believe for some reason I&#039;ll have an 8 game loss streak. I won my way up to P1 50 LP, had Diamond 4 MMR and was carrying in this games, where am I now? Plat 4, and hit Plat 5 for a short period of time, yes, part of it is tilt, but did my knowledge and skill level go down? No, what happened was that Riot algorithms saw that I was deviating from the needed 50% win rate for each player, so what does matchmaking do? They don&#039;t pair you with people that are lower in rank, they pair you with people that are more likely to lose, OR are on a losing streak.\r\n\r\nIt isn&#039;t even that my opponents get harder, my teammates are the ones that get harder to carry. It shouldn&#039;t be like that. If I played 1100 games of Overwatch, or Hearthstone, I&#039;d probably be Diamond level comparison in there rankings, and 1100 games this season, isn&#039;t counting the amount of games played in my earlier seasons. If I combine those games, and play that many games of Overwatch, or Hearthstone, I&#039;d probably naturally rank up to Challenger level from game knowledge and mechanic knowledge.\r\n\r\nWhy can&#039;t we go back to strictly an MMR system? Why do you intentionally make climbing the ladder harder? Why do you push us toward a 50% W/L? Why must I play so many more games than I need to, to get to the rank/MMR I should be playing at?\r\n\r\nDon&#039;t give me this BS about, &quot;If you&#039;ve played that many games, that&#039;s where you belong.&quot; I don&#039;t belong here, the proof is in that I had Diamond 4 MMR a month ago, and I was carrying games at that level, but somehow it&#039;s 100% my fault that I&#039;m sitting in P4 with terrible MMR, now. Granted, part of it is tilt, but under no circumstance should a person be able to do that in this system.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m just so irritated with the way matchmaking is now, it needs to be redone and be an honest system.","replies":[{"poster":"broccoflauer","date":"2017-05-13T14:46:18.087+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ditto.

Especially when in the end of the day the game uses the hidden MMR to build teams and not your actual division.\n\nAnd there's always the buggy client giving people free loses on their series for good measure.\n\nThe ladder system of Season 1 didn't have anything wrong, but Riot will always defend their decisions and try to make them work (read: make things worse, hi flex queue) instead of going back.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheSingularity","date":"2017-04-30T00:43:28.370+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah match making feels like ass right now.\n\nJust over 2 weeks ago me and my bud hit a losing streak. But unlike most cases, this was following a constant W/L/W/L/W/L\nIn a few I played well and could've solo carried had I not been the only player with ample gold. I played horridly in some as I tilted off the face of the earth and the rest were average. I did what I could with what I had to work with which, to be frank wasn't much.\n\nPeople were flaming in champ select, dying less than 30 seconds into lane, demanding ganks before I'd finished my second camp then having the audacity to go \"FFS GANK\" when they fail to 1v1 again as I start my red. \n\nIn the one game I crushed in, I was directly responsible for 8 towers, 5 solo and 3 that wouldn't have fallen without me. I pushed to the dam nexus and the only way I could die was 5V1, as my deaths composed 2 of the 33 team wide deaths. We still lossed as I was the only guy with any gold. That's a game I consider a DECENT performance.\n\n\nJust like you, I'm not perfect. And while the meta may not favour me, both of those things are irrelevant if the game is over before I have an opportunity to do anything.","replies":[]}]}
