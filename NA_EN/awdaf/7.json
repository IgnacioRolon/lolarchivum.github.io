Doom amplifies all magic damage that champion takes by 20% for 4 seconds. 90 second cooldown (750 range).\n\nI wouldn't even call it close tbh. The isssue with DFG was that active did a massive chunk of damage by itself (15% max HP) on top of a 20% damage amp. The flat magic pen that currently is on abyssal actually amps damage by more than 10% against squishies, but isn't very effective vs tanks. Changing it to a flat 10% is a way of balancing it so its not as oppressive against squishies, while offering more damage against tanky enemies.","replies":[{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2016-10-20T04:07:29.420+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"...\nWhy was this ever allowed in the game?","replies":[{"poster":"DemoGuide","date":"2016-10-20T11:46:20.157+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"For DFGaren fun.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RikoZerame","date":"2016-10-20T04:51:58.322+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because it worked with Garen's ult.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Malicious Metal","date":"2016-10-20T11:20:50.647+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because killing anything indiscriminately with DFG->R->Ignite on Morde was fun","replies":[]},{"poster":"oSEXYPLATYPUSo","date":"2016-10-20T05:12:19.836+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it was removed cuz you could have 3000 hp as a tank and get one shot by ahri or who ever had it ... it was so OP one of the most broken items \n\nbut then again there was league of black cleavers where you could get 5 of them and the armor pen stacked and you could do true damage to 150 % armor reduction or whatever it was \n\nand the last broken item was devour \n\nbut ap garen was fun you build DFG with ignite and take magic pen shoes and run magic pen runes you could one shot with dfg ignite ult didnt need to do anything else it was funny","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Brutalitops01","date":"2016-10-20T03:55:03.000+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"The problem with DFG active was that it dealt its own damage (about equal to that of giving a champion a fifth spell) AND buffed future damage that target took by 50%.
