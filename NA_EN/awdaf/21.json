For that, he got a gimmicky ultimate and a stretching strike update (which can be strong once it gets some tweaks).  If you played old Zac enough, you would know that the new Zac is a shell of his former self.","replies":[{"poster":"FloofySheep","date":"2017-05-05T22:04:41.152+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Exactly.  The changes do him actually made him quite a bit worse. His R range doesn't let him do nearly as much. He lost even more damage if you count the w damage he could do with the blobs dropped.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Scary Door","date":"2017-05-05T03:28:36.651+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"I don't think Zac is as bad as many of the posts make him out to be, but with that having been said, there is no way in Hell I would call it a \"buff\".  \n\nHe definitely doesn't feel as rewarding or satisfying to play as he did before. \n\nHonest question:  Was anyone really asking for a Zac rework?  What was reallywrong with him before?  \n\nOf all the tanks for which Riot chose to rework, why was Zac one of them and not Malphite?  Don't get me wrong, I love Malphite as he is personally, but if you're going to update something why not a champ that has been largely untouched for 6 years?","replies":[]},{"poster":"fuffychan","date":"2017-05-05T03:27:36.547+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Theyre bad and havent learned to play him yet.

This is problematic in ganks because enemies with brain cells will not get near you. His new ult is absolute garbage for ganking now, and is solely for teamfights where enemies might not pay attention to you specifically, giving you the opportunity to ult them.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"broccoflauer","date":"2017-05-08T01:09:08.829+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Zac rework is a JOKE.
