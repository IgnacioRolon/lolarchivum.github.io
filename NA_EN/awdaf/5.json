Galio is much stronger than Fiora early game, and will only lose a duel if Fiora ults. But he can easily bully out Fiora with Q's.\n\nAlso, you haven't mentioned her weaknesses.

The reason a Fiora uses a W is to try to predict your CC or try to slow you. You cant complain about her W much because its a prediction on her part as well. if she misses it or wastes it, that's a good 16+s of downtime for you to punish her. She's a very antinoob champion in the sense that you cant just spam your abilities or fight her however/whenever you want, shes an engaging champion to play against.\n\nIts not about not letting her Qs hit you, its about playing around that. You know she's gonna do it if you have a frontal vital, play the game and F her up. The damage is meh early game, shes not nearly as bad as she used to be. \n\nAnother point about the W, is if its blocking an exhaust/ignite then that's borderline your own damn vault, aside from the initial start of the W its very telegraphed. If you used it right as she cast it, then its her making a prediction.\nWhen you play Fiora, you get a \"feel\" for when things are gonna happen. And obviously you'll be wrong sometimes but if you're on top of someone, they're not focusing on outplaying you, but not dying/stopping you. They panic rather than calm down and because of that they get outplayed.\n\nFor example there was a game where I denied malz his ult on me 3 times in a row, because each time I jumped on him was under his tower.  1 Q, used one E, used my hydra and Parried. Which was precisely the time he used ult. the third time I used parry immediately after I used Q because I figured he wouldn't try to hold his ult that time, and I was right again. Its a mechanic that rewards for prediction and punishes poor players.","replies":[{"poster":"General Esdeath ","date":"2017-06-07T01:17:20.584+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"If I stand against a wall I'm immobile, it's hard to miss her W on a melee champ.
