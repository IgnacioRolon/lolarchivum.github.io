Seriously.  The reason is really very simple:\nFor bandwidth usage to have a measurable impact on latency, you have to be using close to your full bandwidth at some point between the two systems.  Unless you have better than a gigabit link to your ISP or there's a satellite link somewhere between you and Riot, the link from you to your ISP is the slowest link between you and the servers.  So, if you're not close to fully saturating your link to your ISP, you should see near zero difference between in game and out of game ping.

If you have a shitty ping in the launcher, then it's because of your own internet connection. And that's pretty easy to detect, just go to Speedtest.net or any other site that check your connection.\n\nOnce the game starts, you're connected to a server that spins up the game for you. You don't know beforehand which server on Riot's network will host your game, and I'm 99.9999% sure Riot does neither. It's determined by an optimization algorithm that factors in a multitude of parameters.\n\nSo having a ping in the Launcher will do absolutely nothing for you.","replies":[{"poster":"Junkο","date":"2017-01-30T20:43:33.076+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"That's completely false, otherwise pinging in cmd would be completely useless, as the packet it sends and receives back would be too small to have any delay, but that is not the case.","replies":[{"poster":"Fegone","date":"2017-01-31T05:55:57.844+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"That has absolutely nothing to do with pinging in CMD. \nNot sure where you get your info from.

This server runs a magnitude of services. Those services communicate with each player connected to that game. They listen for the player input and send back the result and what other players do.\nAs long as you are in the lobby, this server is not yet identified, as to where the game will take place. Then as soon as the loading screen starts, a new Game ID is created. This game ID uniquely identifies the current game you are in. This is how yo u can look up certain games online, or determine if a player is currently in a game (e.g. on LolSumo) - using that game ID. \nYou pinging while in champion select means you are testing your connection to the server where champion select takes place. However, no game has started yet. And also no Game ID has been created yet. Hence, as long as you are in champ select, you cannot use the RiotAPI or an app like LoLSumo to check your opponents, because the game hasn't been created yet.\n\nThis has absolutely nothing to do with whether exploits work or not.\nIf you're using exploits, all you need to do is use Wireshark or Cain&Abel, follow where you send your game packets to or where you get them from, and you can find out the IP of the server you're connected to.\nThen if you're witty and malicious, you modify the packets you are sending or you send fake packets to that server which every single player in your game is connected to, and let the server process your input.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"4th3t0s","date":"2017-01-31T01:44:10.046+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"while you are correct that pinging the launcher doesn't represent your connection to the in-game client, you CAN ping the server directly to get an idea of your in-game latency.
