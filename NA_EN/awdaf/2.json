It said my client disconnected and I was hit with this same pop up about having to repatch my client. Now I lost that game be cause of a remake and I also have a 20 min low priority queue for the 4th time this month because of the leaverbuster.

I'm curious if the updated client is trying to connect to the patching servers but failing to.  What happens if you try launching the legacy client instead:\n\n-  On the login screen of the open beta updated client, look for the \"Launch Legacy Client\" text at the bottom.\n-  Or create a shortcut directly to the legacy client in your League Installation. Just look for \"lol.launcher\"\n\nLet me know!","replies":[]}]}
