The only way my videos are a bit smooth is if I put 30 FPS on, but now you guys implements that 30 or 60 FPS encoding thing, and either one of those make the recording choppy. Help please.","replies":[{"poster":"bezzerkus","date":"2017-05-08T10:55:15.245+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm having the same issue as the OP with nothing running in the background. In game I'm getting around 120-80 fps but when I view the replays after the game they stay at 30 fps. Slowing it down from 1.0x to .5x smooths it a bit but slow motion is not what I'd like. Tried changing the settings from 15fps to uncapped and everything in between and everytime I view the replay it stays at 30fps. Won't go higher or lower. I see there has been no follow up to this issue so I'm posting in hopes that I get a reply.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-27T05:53:07.054+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So you're experiencing a bad framerate while **viewing** a replay, or are you just seeing a bad framerate in a *Highlights* that you recorded? Replays are viewed in the client, while Highlights are viewed in most video players or web browsers.","replies":[{"poster":"awdaf","date":"2017-01-27T16:07:10.159+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am getting the 30 FPS when I view the replay, and when I record, it won't be above 30 FPS either.
