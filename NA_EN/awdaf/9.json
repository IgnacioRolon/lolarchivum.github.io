One of her biggest weaknesses is that she has short range. There are plenty of mid lane mages that (when played correctly) can poke her to death without Annie laying a finger on them. Play {{champion:134}} {{champion:101}} {{champion:99}} {{champion:161}} {{champion:25}}{{champion:7}}  and make her life hell. Others have means of living through her burst and dealing good damage in return. {{champion:43}} {{champion:8}} {{champion:50}} {{champion:26}}. \n\n> but honestly, that's an advantage for her since she needs to be in range to deal damage.\n\nHow is immobility an advantage? It makes her prone to ganks and easier to land skillshots on. Can you imagine how much worse it would be if she had some sort of built-in mobility?\n\n> she will out damage you and out CC you no matter what.\n\nPure hyperbole. Syndra, Leblanc, Morgana, and Zilean are her biggest counters.\n\nYes, she is a strong mid-laner. She has reliable cc and damage and is powerful in team fights. Tibbers can do a lot of work even on his own. But please stop acting as if she has no weaknesses and automatically beats any other midlane champ.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Yetii Rider","date":"2016-10-17T16:45:29.950+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":3,"body":"Annie is one of the few true burst mages we have left.

One well placed tibbers, which any annine with a couple of games on her will know when to drop, and that could be the turn that your team needed.

Her farming is disgustingly easy as well since 99% of the time in lane you are using your Q to last hit. The trading she has pre-6 is usually always a loss since she can just stun you into her other abilities and proc thunderlords decree.\n\nAnd now the fun part; level 6. When she hits 6 she literally creates an unparalleled amount of lane pressure. No gank needed, if you're a little bit chunked from her basic abilities you are going to die. R base damage is insane all is needed is RQW ignite (if she has it) and you're dead, so dumb.","replies":[]}]}
