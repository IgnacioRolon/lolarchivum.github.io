I can understand abuse if someone creates multiple accounts in attempts to keep reaching the same person and throwing foul language in them, but when you have the ability to mute that person for letting out steam because he wants to criticize you in a foul way, and that person gets banned, doesn&#039;t make sense in my mind.\n\nEdit: YAYYYYYY, DOWNVOTES AS EXPECTED","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-06-08T21:53:49.669+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":1,"body":"If a player is forced to mute you, you've likely already done damage. Muting is to prevent *further* problems from you only in the *current* match. Reporting is to prevent you from being a problem in the future to more people.\n\nAccount bans take a while to get to. Chat restrictions are the first tiers of penalties, and most people that get them reform and never reach the \"unfair\" ban for verbal abuse. It's when a player refuses to change and continues to be a problem that they get moved up to a ban, though extremely toxic behavior may result in skipping chat restrictions altogether.\n\nAlso, \"foul language\" typically isn't the issue. It's directing it at other players in a negative manner that is.\n\n> shouldn't the logical and mature thing\n\nVerbally abusing people is the opposite of mature, so I wouldn't accuse others of not wanting to deal with it of being immature.

If the person isn't gonna do it if you tell them in a friendly manner, why would you expect them to do it after you've raged at them?
