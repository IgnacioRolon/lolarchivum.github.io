I don&#039;t have a good tree name, so here&#039;s a [puppy](http://www.westsuburbandog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Bulldog-Puppies.jpg). Also, numbers aren&#039;t final and are there to give you a general idea. \r\n\r\nKeystones:\r\n\r\n_Fist of War_:\r\nCD: _None_\r\nWhile your champion is in combat, it gains 1 stack a second. Stacks grant _2 - 16_ AD or _4 - 32_ AP, adaptive. After reaching _5_ stacks, your champions next basic attack will deal _10 - 130 + (30% Bonus AD) / (15% AP)_  adaptive damage, and consume the stacks. Stacks last for _3_ seconds out of combat, then decay at a rate of 2 stacks a second. Bonus basic attack damage is halved for ranged champions. Your current stacks would be displayed in the buff bar. When you reach _5_ stacks, your champions hand/appendage thing, will glow until you basic attack, or have your stacks fall off. \r\n\r\n_Titan Strength_: \r\nCD: _20 - 6_\r\nPassively, your champion has the duration of knockups reduced by _15 - 30%_. Actively, immobilizing effects, on your champion, grant your champion a _20 - 60 + (4% Bonus Health)_ shield for _2_ seconds. While this Keystone is off CD, it appears on your buff bar. \r\n\r\n_Warlord&#039;s Rage_:\r\nCD: _35 - 18_\r\nTaking more than _20%_ of your max health as within _4_ seconds enrages your champion for _5_ seconds. While enraged, your champion takes _10 - 32%_ less damage, and deals _5 - 16%_ more damage. CD activates once your champion is no longer enraged. This Keystone is _75%_ effective on ranged champions. This would be shown as a red glow at the base of your champion when this Keystone is off CD, with your champion having the red effect overlayed on them, similar to Gargoyle&#039;s Stoneplate when this Keystone is active. \r\n\r\n\r\nFirst row of Runelings:\r\n\r\n_Crush the Weak_:\r\nCD: _4_\r\nAfter immobilizing an enemy champion, your next basic attack deals _5 + (5% bonus AD) / (10% AP)_ bonus adaptive damage. \r\n\r\n_Battle Trance_:\r\nCD: _8_\r\nDealing _15%_ of a champions max health grants you _10% - 20%_ Tenacity for the next _4_ seconds. \r\n\r\n_Fearless_:\r\nCD: _12_\r\nAfter being immobilized, your champions gains _8 - 16%_ of their armor and magic resist as bonus armor and magic resist, respectively, for the next _2_ seconds. \r\n\r\n\r\nSecond row of Runelings: \r\n\r\n_Steel Bones_:\r\nPassively, your champion takes _5 - 10_ less damage from basic attacks and single target abilities, and _2 - 4_ less damage from AOE and DOT abilities. \r\n\r\n_Spiney Skin_: \r\nPassively, enemy units that basic attack your champion take _6 - 18_ magic damage. \r\n\r\n_Veteran&#039;s Scars_:\r\nPassively, your champion gains _50_ max health at _5_ minutes. Every _5_ minutes after that, your champion will gain _10_ max health. \r\n\r\n\r\nThird row of Runelings:\r\n\r\n_Demimortal Bastion_:\r\nCD: _300_\r\nAfter channeling for _3_ seconds, your champion will link with the targeted turret, granting it _10%_ of your current resists as bonus resists, and _16%_ of your AD, or _8%_ of your AP as bonus magical damage on its shots. This damage only applies to summoned units and champions, not minions. This link lasts until your champion dies, the turret is destroyed, or you link to another turret. Turrets can only be linked to one champion at a time. This rune starts the game on CD. \r\n\r\n_Monster Hunter_:\r\nPassively, your champion deals _8%_ increased damage to monsters, and _4%_ increased damage to minions. Every _15_kills, _1_ for minions, _2_ for cannon and super minions, _2_ for jungle monsters, and _5_ for epic monsters, your champion gains _1_ AD or _2_ AP, and _4_ health. \r\n\r\n_Arcane Lord_:\r\nPassively, your champion gains _5%_ of their AP as bonus magical damage on their basic attacks, and _10%_ of their AD as bonus physical damage on their spells. This bonus is halved for AOE and DOT spells. \r\n\r\n\r\nThoughts?","replies":[{"poster":"ConcreteLamp","date":"2017-12-07T09:24:34.907+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The problem with this, and porbably any other bruiser specific bruiser rune tree, would be other roles like tanks being able to abuse them","replies":[{"poster":"TheHappyReaperz","date":"2017-12-07T15:44:55.133+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I thought about that while making it. I realize that quite a few of these Runes would be good on tanks, but I don't think the Keystones would be good enough for them to justify taking this over the Resolve tree. While tanks could use this tree as their secondary, they would be losing out on some damage, as this tree offers less in the way of direct damage, unlike Sorcery or Domination. It also offers way less in the way of sustain. For example, if you go this tree secondary over Sorcery, you lose out on Manaflow Band, which really hurts your laning phase sustain.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ampheon","date":"2017-12-06T23:26:51.316+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think this should be in the gameplay thread","replies":[{"poster":"TheHappyReaperz","date":"2017-12-07T02:00:26.810+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While it does relate to gameplay, it is a concept, which I created.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Tenth Leper","date":"2017-12-06T23:38:36.621+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Up vote for puppy!","replies":[]}]}
