I then tried to que up a custom bot game, to fix my settings, only to disconnect immediately, and then be unable to reconnect, as each time I tried to reconnect, it disconnected me again. I was currently on the legacy client, so I tried updating to the BETA client, to see if it would help. Unfortunetly, the problem persisted, and I can't get into any games period. I then deleted and reinstalled League, thinking I may have damaged the files in some way, and signed on to my main account, this one. I entered through the legacy client, started up a bot game, locked in Karthus, and ten seconds later disconnected. When I tried to reconnect, it disconnected me again, and gave me the bugsplat thing to fill out. What should I do?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-05T23:11:12.285+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The bugsplat error strongly indicates that this is not a connection problem, but something going wrong with your pc like drivers or game files.
