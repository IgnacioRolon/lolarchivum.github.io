Lose 2 in a row no matter what.\nI can understand the chat restrict for flaming the afks and inting people but, I dont see them punished. In fact, I call bullshit for chat restricting when I get elo punished for trying my best.\nI dont understand what's the incentive here for being good player if I get punished for no reason.\n\nNow I lose close to 19LP when I used to lose 13LP after losing 4 series straight.\n\nSo RIOT, what the FUCK do you want me to do?\nPlay nice or pat people on the back?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-31T02:00:02.018+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Even though you aren't seeing the people you report getting punished, that doesn't necessarily mean it's alright to start flaming or inting like you mentioned.

LOOK at all record where I lose 2 games straight whenever I get into series.\n\nAnd I get taxed and punished heavier every time i play series. And in my last series, the whole team trolled me since they knew I was in series. So just take it in my ass and say gg for shit games? \n\nFucking please. Where is the sportsmanship in that?","replies":[]}]}]}
