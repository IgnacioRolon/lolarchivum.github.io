That's not all, I have observed that they hide behind minions and just spam spells and attacks towers even though they are getting hit and even after all the minions died.\n\nI realized it was those farm bots that level up accounts. As usual I have reported every single one of them.\nHowever, what frightens me is that they are farming these \"sale\" account while ruining newbies game and i've seen them in 3 out of 5 game-ish.\n\nSo shouldn't Riot do something about these? Or nah?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-06-20T20:47:11.255+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Technically, players are not forced to use chat at all.
