So can he ever earn loot(His ban ended on MAY 28)?\n\nThanks for the help!\n-Bansheenoir- (0ㅡ0)/ Hail ~~Hydra~~ Demacia(-ㅡ-)","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-20T02:23:04.262+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the feedback about the new mission system! I'm personally looking forward to seeing how it evolves over time and through future events. \n\nThere weren't any major changes to how the usual loot systems work, just additions to it like tokens. Your club members might have already earned a chest for the champions they've been playing, keep in mind you can only get one chest for each champion each season.\n\nAs far as loot restrictions go, they will be lifted after showing consistent behavior improvement. This time period can be different for everyone, so just encourage them to stay positive and they'll be able to get loot again before too long!","replies":[{"poster":"Bansheenoir","date":"2017-06-20T02:43:16.232+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey BROPORO,\n\nThanks for the reply!\nHere are the images that might help you understand about the current situation.\n\nhttps://ibb.co/gyZP8Q\nhttps://ibb.co/d83vF5\nhttps://ibb.co/bUH0hk\nhttps://ibb.co/fV648Q\nhttps://ibb.co/cXn0hk","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-20T04:17:18.179+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So, most likely the reason you haven't received chests for those champions due to the fact that you're still currently ineligible for hextech loot. Anytime you receive a punishment you will be unable to get loot for a period of time until you've shown consistent reform.
