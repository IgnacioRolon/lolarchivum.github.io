This can have MAJOR disruptions in the company when shit doesn't work (sound familiar?).\n\nNow, what they SHOULD have done is a parallel conversion. With a parallel conversion, you KEEP the old system and the NEW system running together for a few months. This allows users and creators to dabble in the new system and report any bugs. This, of course, takes more time to implement the new system AND costs more (we are running two systems that achieve the same goal AND having to maintain both until the new replaces the old. Not very efficient business wise), BUT you catch a lot more bugs. The upside as well with a parallel conversion is that if you find the new system not fit for release, you can easily pull it to keep working on it and then bring it back up later for more user testing along side the old system.\n\nNow I know what people are going to say \"We tested it on the PBE\". Yes, because PBE testing 100% matches the amount of people on the live servers. Get outta here.\n\nIt could have been really easy to make this work too. They could have given users incentives to play on the NEW system to test it so they could collect data. \"Play X amount of hours in the new system this month and you get Y% discount in the store/merch store.\" \"You get X% bonus IP for playing in the new system for this month as a thank you for helping us collect data.\"\n\nBut they didn't. They took the fast and cheap way out, and now they are suffering the consequences.","replies":[{"poster":"Hatsuma","date":"2016-06-04T11:36:49.492+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not to mention rolling it and new role select out at the exact same time.
