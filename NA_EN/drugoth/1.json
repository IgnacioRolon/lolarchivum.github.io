The damage could even scale with how high you&#039;re knocked up and how large/heavy your champion is (Think a stacked Cho vs a Teemo). Certain champions could be immune to fall damage altogether (Kayle, Anivia for instance).\r\n\r\nThis could add a small bit of complexity to the game as well as adding some little bit of realism. Of course all existing knockups would have to have their numbers tuned for this.\r\n\r\nWhat do you guys think?","replies":[{"poster":"BLACK REALM GOD","date":"2017-09-12T17:26:33.818+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"i think no and i'll explain why :\n\nfall damage would be added bonus damage that would have to be tweaked for every individual ability and champion adding to the stress on the game and reducing balance. the benefits are negligible because the values would be identical in your proposal due to the tweaking and the assumption is that knock up timers would need to be adjusted which would in a way be a form of tenacity that is not directly addressed. combine this with the fact that not all of the terrain in league is on the same elevation point (as in there are inclines in the terrain) and you'll have a mess of formulas that is problematic and adds little value to gameplay dynamics and user experience.","replies":[{"poster":"Drugoth","date":"2017-09-12T17:30:14.522+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fair enough.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"FooDang","date":"2017-09-12T17:51:09.582+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Inb4 {{champion:80}} kills himself...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Aatrox Mid 1v5","date":"2017-09-12T17:26:56.622+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"this doesnt make any sense...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shad√≤w","date":"2017-09-12T17:37:09.914+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"so of all the things wrong with realism in this game, that is the first thing you want to be changed?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tenth Leper","date":"2017-09-12T17:29:22.712+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think it would be difficult to implement but it is certainly interesting.

Knockback/Knockup duration increases with animation speed. Knockbacks that last longer are animated slower, but that's it. height always stays the same, therefore it would not really make a difference.\n\nBesides, adding more damage to CC that already has damage doesn't Sound like much of a good idea.\n\nwhile i like the concept, it is not possible in a game where everything that isn't a dash is already a set distance.
