(And other, non-binary kin)","subforum":"General Discussion","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSnUmaXQS30\n\nI think I can fairly say that we men of the community would be quite welcoming of an influx of female/other fans! Why? Friends, sisters, girlfriends, mothers, daughters, think of all the loved ones we could enjoy one of our favourite pastimes with! I already play with my sister and her husband regularly and we have a blast when we do too! (We play mostly ARAM because we suck at rift and ARAM is our jam because we all like a wide variety of the champions in this game)\n\nThere is a few problems with this dream. Video games as a media, especially high-skill ceiling, high skill curve computer games, are already generally not of interest to women at large. There are many contributing factors, be it from the community itself, or even the game&#039;s content or difficulty of entry. Maybe it&#039;s a factor of the design of the champions themselves? No, that can&#039;t be it, my sister tells me there are many champions that appeal to her, even champions ones wouldn&#039;t traditionally think a girl would like, like {{champion:57}} or {{champion:36}} !\n\nWell then, is it the type of game it is then? Let&#039;s deconstruct it.\n\nLeague of legends is a 5v5 Arena MOBA with Opposing facing bases on a large square map, there are 3 lanes connecting both bases, a jungle and river in between with numerous neutral objectives and winding entrances and exits to existing lanes. All you gotta do is destroy the enemies nexus, right? Oh wait, it&#039;s not that simple, there are nearly 150 UNIQUE champions in this game, all with an existing base passive ability and 4 actives, one of those being an ultimate you don&#039;t unlock until level 6. There are rune pages, item builds, stat-checking and metas to learn.\n\n**League is a HARD game to get into**\n\nBut, we already know all this.\n\nHow do we overcome it?\n\nSome ideas I have been thinking about for awhile:\n\n1. ~~A Women&#039;s Esports League? There are many women&#039;s versions of professional leagues for all sorts of different sports that all have adoring fanbases and followings. Tennis, Basketball, Soccer (or Football if you will), Golf, geez I could just go on. Maybe introducing a women&#039;s professional scene will stir support for it and increase viewership and popularity?~~ A major stretch, not very likely to accomplish an idea like this with the current pool of female players?\n\n2. The community could host private tournaments in Highschool Gyms maybe to get an even younger audience?\n\n3...\n\n--------------\n\n**Okay, I&#039;ll admit it, I&#039;m not nearly as creative as I seem to think I am, that&#039;s where I need your guys help! How do we reach out and appeal to more demographics? I&#039;m sure I would love to try to get my girlfriend to play one day, right now, as it is, she gets pretty frustrated because there are too many systems to learn and she&#039;s not really a core gamer.**","replies":[]}
