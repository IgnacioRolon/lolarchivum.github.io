With hextech being prevalent in Piltover, would Piltover even have an army, or just legions of automatons similar to what we saw in Jinx&#039;s music video? Would Zaun also have the same thing?\r\n\r\nAre there any alloys specific to Runeterra with special properties? Kind of like Adamantite, or Orichalcum, etc?\r\n\r\nFinally, would human modification (hextech limb replacements) or augmentation be used in Piltover at all? I know Zaun uses it with reckless abandon.","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2015-12-03T17:01:11.088+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello there!  I know I'm not the red name you'd like here (sorry) but maybe I can help a little bit (even if it's just getting more eyeballs on this).\n\nI do know that in [Shadow and Fortune, chapter 2](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/site/shadow-and-fortune/chapter-2.html), part IV, Rafen _claims_ to have a blade of **Demacian Sunsteel**.  Later, Miss Fortune finds that her own blade of Demacian make (maybe true Sunsteel?) does real damage to the undead spirits of the Harrowing - while most weapons are unable to do so.\n\nThere's also the stone of Lucian (and Senna)'s pistols which shoots rays of undead-destroying light, though I'm not sure if that stone is named anywhere.","replies":[{"poster":"Piltover Customs","date":"2015-12-03T21:34:04.708+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"When I read the title I thought of: worldbuilders.org ... apparently I was mistaken :/","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"La Bello","date":"2015-12-03T17:07:09.486+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"the probably do use robots as an army in a effort to keep war casualties at a minimum. keep in mind most \"Pilties\" seem to be spoiled and rich(Graves doesnt like thier wine because its too fancy and Ekko probably suffers from serious envy issues).\n\nAs for augmentation Viktor has shown that replacing limbs is well within their science capabilities so they probably could.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zyorhist","date":"2015-12-02T20:14:58.395+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also I'd like to note, in my perspective, Zaun takes their advances from wherever else they see them.  If piltover invented the limb replacement Zaun took it to the extreme, though I can't see Zaun coming up with it themselves.  That's just me.
