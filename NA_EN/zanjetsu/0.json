I always felt dorans blade was slightly weaker than other starting items, but it looks fine because ranged characters have good laning phases. A melee champ starting this item can easily lose his single potion. And no one stacks DBlades anymore. So what if DBlade was slightly better, either costing 420g with other dorans items with 40g potions or a marginal stat tweak and all typical ranged auto attackers lost like 1 or 2 AD for lane. This would also reduce ranged characters poaching relic shield or dorans shield or even corrupting potion. Also I feel refill potion is clearly way more valuable and that red potions are thought to be too wasteful now. Hence why 40g potions as long as getting kills in lane stays doable. Now tho I'm not sure about all these changes however. I feel like starting items + potions across the board could use a medium scope rework to make them unsolved again as they are very important items interacted with early in the game. I would actually wonder if a future better design for new dorans items would be to make them less stat dependent and say \"this is a health dorans item\" or \"this is a mana dorans item.\" With like a 3rd or 4th being... gold? Potions (well we has corrupting already)? And Assassin-y (stacking?)? If I wanted to super power them then they would be limited to 1 dorans.\n\nAlso I would raise IE cost back up even though zeal upgrades might be OP. The zeals are useful bridges from other builds. Pushing off IE complete time like it used to be would maybe open up early game centric adc item diversity again which gets adc to sorta self regulate.\n\nAlso as for playing as AD I feel like they don't get enough choices for their build. I miss when adc were somehow satisfied around 50-55% crit and had one more slot. And getting near 100% crit was weird. I dunno what caused it to change exactly.

All the specific complaints are symptoms of that.  Why are tanks outdamaging fighters? They didnt buff tank damage, you just lost 12 mr from glyphs.\n\nOf course it got downvoted to oblivion.  This community is horrible.  They want to relentlessly complain and when someone says 'Hey I'm pretty sure this is the reason why' you get downvoted into oblivion.\n\nI made a thread about rework Caitlyn waaaay back.  I said her base damage is too high, it's oppressive, no one will want to play against it.  Downvoted to oblivion.  2 months later community raging about how oppressive she is.\n\nI made a thread a few months ago about how Tristana's kit was too versatile.  The kit itself has no inherent weakness.  Downvoted to oblivion.  Look at what the boards do now.\n\nThey don't want solutions.  They just want to bitch about something.","replies":[{"poster":"SirLapse","date":"2018-02-18T11:44:26.241+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"The MR loss was huge yeah. Main reason Teemo got so oppressive was that he essentially got the same damage as the buggy Thunderlord via Aery in just one Q>AA trade, and with gutted MR he would take like 1/4 of someone's health.\n\nA lot of these changes are kind of ignored because people don't look under the surface though. I will say that tanks even if they were lackluster in lane right now still have more CC and therefore more impact in a game even if they lose lane simply because damage, an expensive stat, is not their priority outside of a few champs. People tend to forget this over and over.\n\nSustain has taken HUGE hits as Riot seemingly wants games to be more punishing to the individual for misplaying. Top lane literally lives and breathes off of lane sustain and making comebacks, and it's essentially been killed off in the item department without anyone noticing outside of what? ADC using Doran's sustain way back? It was never addressed ever again, so you need Fleet Footwork or in-kit sustain to do anything, or be the one *always* winning the trades/committing to harass.\n\nFor Tristana, she's only good when crit is the main build. Otherwise she gets knocked off and has trouble recovering at all outside of some extreme snowbally cases. Something else overlooked.\n\nAll you can keep doing really is keep trying and try to word your posts in a way people can be more open to it, while also leaving yourself open to discussion.

What I mean is that the game is losing that made it a masterpiece in the first place: the unique passion and drive that made League the Beast it is.\n\nI wouldn't lie and say that I haven't say said some nasty things about Riot on the boards because I've been angry over how things in terms of gameplay experience has become so bad and that people thing It's like, just like that dog with a hat in the burning house. I get pissed over the fact that the dev's can do a better job and I ain't because I want to demand a perfect meta, that can never happen but I always have faith in the dev's at least can make the game as balance as possible. The reason I get mad is because I believe that League can get back on track and regain the essence that lead people to play and love the game from the early seasons. Doing so would make League far better than ever as it combines the the heart with the features that have been added to the game to create a more rich and stable game in spite of gamebreaking champions, items etc. \n\nThere are problems with League and this time it ain't just people complaining because of lousy reasons, but because as players, we are dealing with a crippling balance problem and it has to be dealt with now.
