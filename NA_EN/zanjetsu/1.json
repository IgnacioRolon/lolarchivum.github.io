Even something as simple as \"Draven ignores unit collision while an Axe is in the air\" would suffice.\n\n[ Some passives, such as Zilean's and Draven's, will stop contributing if a game goes long enough.

The snowballing was secondary to that problem. He was snowballing because he was just stronger than everyone else early game, and that was the core issue. The new passive doesn't make him stronger than everyone else early game just by default. It gives him a reward if he's doing well, and that can start a snowball, but he actually has to do something in order to be stronger than other champions. That's way better than snowballing because you're just stronger right out of the gate.\n\n>except at 6 Item lategame you literally DONT HAVE A PASSIVE.\n\nHonestly, I don't care. Very few games make it to 6 items, a small percentage of those spend a significant amount of time at 6 items, and even then he's still stronger at 6 items than plenty of other champions are. I don't really care if a passive stops functioning in the very end of a very small portion of my games.\n\n>What about game modes where gold wont matter?\n\nWhat about them? Even in  ARAM he does perfectly fine, and that's about as much of a gold-guaranteed mode as the game has ever had. Again, I'm not seeing a real problem.
