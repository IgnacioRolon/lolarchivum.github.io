Whenever I&#039;m playing League my computer makes a weird sound and it just stops working, it won&#039;t answer anything, I can only turn it off.. I just got the computer, I don&#039;t know what&#039;s happening.. Also, I can play 3v3 just fine on twisted treeline but whenever its 5v5 either Summoner&#039;s Rift or Howling Abyss it makes that sound! And I don&#039;t have skype on or anything, and I tried lowering the graphics.. Does this happen to anyone else?! Is it normal?! How can I fix it?! ...

Most of them can be found under \"system information\" on windows.\n**OS: **Operating System, like windows 7, windows 10, Ubuntu, OS X Yosemite, ect.\n**Drivers:** Software that runs important hardware in the computer, in this case the graphics processor (GPU). Outdated or incorrect driver versions cause all sorts of issues.\n\n\nA computer crashing when it is trying to load a program suggests one of a few things: corrupt or damaged hard drive areas, a virus that is interfering in come way, or corrupt/modified graphics drivers, although i have never heard of bad drivers causing a full system freeze.\nMy bet is on hard drive problems, especially if the computer is more then 5 years old.\n\n**Here is what you should do:**\nGet the free version of malwarebytes antimalware. It is possibly the best free virus-removal program. Install it, run a full scan of your computer. It cant hurt, and it may help.

All I use my computer for is netflix, league and skype. I'm extra careful so my mom won't use any movie sites besides netflix so she doesn't even use the computer cause she knows i dont want viruses. I have my firewall activated at all times, I only turn it off to play league and I turn it on right after I stop playing. So I doubt it's the computer. At least it can't be about virus. Maybe my computer is too weak to support 5v5? But I play 3v3 with high quality and everything and it wont even lag, but when its 5v5 I put everything on low and it just bugs.

If that is required for it to run properly, something is definitely wrong. It definitely gives no performance improvement, the time it takes the firewall to process packets would be measured in nanoseconds.\n\nDoes it only happen on summoner's rift, or does it also happen on crystal scar or howling abyss? \nHave you tried running CHKDSK? It really sounds like some of the data for SR is in a corrupt or damaged hard drive sector, nothing else should cause a full system crash under such specific conditions.\n\nAlso, Mcafee kind of sucks <_<","replies":[{"poster":"FoodInc","date":"2016-11-05T20:12:17.434+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I got my system info so you can see if it's something with the computer..\nEdition: Windows 10 Home\nVersion: 1607\nOS Build: 14393.222\nProduct ID: 00325-80517-07988-AAOEM\nProcessor: Intel(R) Core(TM) i3-5005U CPU @ 2.00GHz 2.00 GHz\nInstalled RAM: 4.00 GB\nSystem Type: 64-bit operating system, x64-based processor \n\nWhat else should I know?

I am a bit perplexed by that CPU, it is very new, very expensive, and very, very bad. It looks like an entry-level laptop cpu, but ones a third of the price from the same generation are several times faster.  (it is a bit weaker than my 5-year-old my i3-2100, and that can barely run graphics for a browser by itself).\n\nCheck if you have a dedicated graphics card, it should be under system information > hardware > display, or something similar, it would be a NVIDIA or AMD processor. If you do, it could be malfunctioning or accidentally turned off (windows 10 laptops love doing this for some reason).\n\nIf so, follow these instructions to turn it on for LoL http://www.pcadvisor.co.uk/how-to/pc-components/how-set-default-graphics-card-3612668/","replies":[{"poster":"FoodInc","date":"2016-12-09T20:40:47.075+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it's now working perfectly!
