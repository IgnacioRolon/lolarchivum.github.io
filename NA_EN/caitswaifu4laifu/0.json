This happened before, but I looked on the boards and fixed it, just deleting the \"LeagueClient\" from my League of Legends folder. It has now happened again a week later. Any suggestions on how to fix it will be greatly appreciated. Thanks!\r\nNote: I'm extremely worried too >.&lt;\r\n{{sticker:sg-lux-2}}","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-20T00:22:17.388+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So the steps in this image weren't helping with this error?\n\nhttps://i.gyazo.com/fbe5976243158ecce7efef172951e219.png\n\nIf not, we may need to hit this a little harder by using the [**Hextech Repair Tool**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367-Automated-Troubleshooting-Hextech-Repair-Tool) to run a reinstall and clean uninstall.","replies":[{"poster":"CaitsWaifu4Laifu","date":"2017-09-20T00:31:04.734+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Broporo,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=iPYndurc,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-09-20T00:22:17.388+0000)\n>\n> So the steps in this image weren&#x27;t helping with this error?\n> \n> https://i.gyazo.com/fbe5976243158ecce7efef172951e219.png\n> \n> If not, we may need to hit this a little harder by using the [**Hextech Repair Tool**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367-Automated-Troubleshooting-Hextech-Repair-Tool) to run a reinstall and clean uninstall.\n\nNo, I tried that and it worked for a bit, but then the message came up again.\nI'm installing and using the Hextech Repair Tool now, thank you for the recommendation.","replies":[]}]}]}
