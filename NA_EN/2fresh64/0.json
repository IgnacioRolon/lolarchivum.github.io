PS i went 6 and 4 this game... akali went 3 and 4 ... was the only one on team with positive kdr xD","replies":[{"poster":"Jo0o","date":"2018-08-06T21:16:40.021+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"If I'm reading your match history correctly, you lasted exactly one game after coming back from your two-week ban.

Someone else's toxicity doesn't excuse you of toxicity, and it makes it worse for the 8 other players.\n2.

The logic runs that anyone who already got multiple punishments is incapable of correcting their behavior and needs to be removed.

Said that you weren't going to gank (\"you are on your own\", etc.) and then saying that the reason why another person was losing was you not ganking. (Constructive inting.)\n2. Repeatedly asked in chat for others to report another player. (Conspiring with others to report.)\n3. Rubbed in the \"report\" to the player who was penalized. (Negative behaviour)\n4. Put down another player's abilities in chat - e.g., \"You are not good\". (Negative behaviour.)\n\nBan?
