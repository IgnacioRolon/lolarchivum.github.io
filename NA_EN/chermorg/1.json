While you have the potential to be screwed if you end up in any of those AOEs, If their skills shots miss you, they miss you, and they don't have this huge backup plan built into them if the player isn't skilled enough to land a skill shot on you. The trap is simply unnecessary on Zoe; it sugar coats the lack of skill involved in missing a skill shot.","replies":[{"poster":"Chermorg","date":"2018-01-22T23:23:11.110+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Well, I think what we have to remember is that most champions that have these abilities (Anivia R, iceborn gauntlet, etc) have some other form of either hard CC or have a backup plan. Zoe only has 2 real abilities out of 4 - her third is a rotating one time use active item, and her fourth is just a quick reposition and blink back, this in comparison to champions that have 4 damaging/ccing abilities that are constant cooldowns and not random.\n\nI don't think it sugarcoats missing a skillshot, as it's *extremely fucking easy* to dodge this zone. That's like saying a Soraka silence zone is bad because it's a zone that both silences and can apply a root to someone - no, it's easy as all get out to dodge. Likewise, if you dodge the skillshot and initial expansion of the area (which isn't the problem with it as other abilities have this expanding at the end), you shouldn't have trouble dodging the zone that's immobile and unchanging for 4 seconds after.\n\nI think considering the fact that her E is basically two abilities in one makes it more palatable. If thinking of it this way doesn't help (the fact that this is one of 2 real abilities she has, she has no real ultimate power boost, etc), then I have another idea below:\n\nWhat if her W was moved into either passive or ultimate spots, and the \"sleep zone\" was made into a wholly separate ability - i.e. the sleep skillshot would *not* leave a zone, but the sleep bubble would *instantly* create a zone? Would it then be acceptable? I think the answer is yes to most people (maybe not, please correct me if I'm wrong), but if that's acceptable to have it as two different abilities, considering the fact her passive and ultimate are extremely weak (and imo can't be considered abilities at all) does it not make sense to have it combined?\n\nI understand that this is new to a lot of people - but everything's new. Airborne was a new thing when Yasuo came out (well, not really, but *using* it as part of a kit was). When Soraka was reworked, AOE silence was a new thing. Tahm Kench and Ryze brought in group/dual teleports that are virtually global (unpredictable unless you know its range and exactly where opponent is when using it). There are new mechanics/abilities all the time - and something being new does not necessarily mean it's bad.\n\nI doubt Riot is going to remove the trap - how would you feel about a quick expansion and then slow decrease over 4 seconds in size until gone? The biggest part of this trap is the ability for Zoe to zone a champion into it - and this allows her to still do it but allows for easier dodging if she misses. Alternatively (not in combination with decreasing size), what if the CD for the ability were to start after the trap expires - not when cast?","replies":[{"poster":"GodlyBane","date":"2018-01-22T23:28:32.185+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"just delete zoe, she causes too many balance issues, delete her so u can focus on other champs that need fixing or buffing.

I don't see her abilities as massively inflated. Her burst is similar to that of other champions designed to burst people down, just combined into two abilities instead of three. This is a net neutral (as it provides less cooldown to keep track of and less opportunities to F up a combo, but provides an easier chance to dodge as there's less to dodge and less to keep track of for the enemy also). Furthermore, both of her damage abilities are skillshots, whereas someone like VelKoz, with a similar angled Q mechanic, has two virtually point and damage abilities to round out his kit.\n\n2. To be honest her W is virtually always underpowered in lane. Her W does virtually no damage, and the most it'll do is give her a slow or a heal one time use. She has very limited time to pick up the item and use it. Her W is more powerful for chases, as well as for mobility in teamfights.\n\n3. The bells and whistles make her have a much higher skillcap to both play and play against. I don't think that it's easy to hit an E. It's not like Leona or anivia where you go through minions. It's not like brand where it requires recent damage, and it's not like any point and click CC. It has limitations such as a relatively large hit box, but she is able to play around that by angling herself to be able to hit the champion. If her enemy fails at playing against this, it's no different than playing against a thresh/blitz botlane, or against an Illaoi toplane, for example. The difference is Zoe ult lets her angle - that's where dodging comes in.\n\nI don't think she needs dumpstered. There is counterplay to her that people are still getting used to. Let's wait at least 6 months or so before we talk about removing key kit items when the problem in all of your points is the damage.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TotalJerk","date":"2018-01-23T21:56:22.668+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Terrible idea.

I get that the Boards, and probably many more players, are likely aware that Zoe is unhealthy and perhaps still a little too strong, but even so, that nonetheless doesn't really give all the context needed to understand what exactly your solution aims to resolve. While I personally like your idea, ideas in any creative medium are a dime a dozen, and have no intrinsic value of their own until proven: what is more important here is the process of reasoning that got you to the idea, and more specifically here the statement of the problem you're coming up with ideas to fix in the first place.\n\nNow that that's been said, I do think it could help to remove some extraneous effects from Zoe's kit, including the impact damage on her E, as she currently has a lot going on and gets to deal a lot of burst even when she's not landing her Q, which is supposed to be her prime source of damage. It could also be interesting to make the ability more of a damage bonus for teammates, rather than herself, though that could also push her towards bot lane and require balancing there too (which wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing if Zoe could remain viable mid). Overall, limiting her non-Q damage sounds like a good idea, as she already has several cheap and relatively safe means of dealing damage, and is frustrating as a result of it.\n\nHowever, I'm personally not sure if this would really fix Zoe's largest problems: in my opinion, the fundamental issue with her playstyle is that she's designed to one-shot, but also can personally lay down hard CC that completely prevents her opponent from reacting to her one-shot ability. Effectively, all else held equal, landing a single spell on a squishy can guarantee her a kill, whereas her range and utility give her plenty more options to escape punishment. Her kit takes the core combo of burst mages to an extreme, along with the associated frustration of getting killed during hard CC, while also adding in the low cooldowns and high ranges (and therefore the safety) of artillery mages. Because of this, I don't think her Q and E can ever truly be healthy together: even if her E stun were changed to stasis, it would still leave a fraction of time where her target would be a sitting duck, and that is enough to take a lot of much-needed counterplay out of her kit. Because of this, I think Zoe could perhaps be healthy as either a one-shot champion or a champion with long-ranged hard CC, but not both at the same time.","replies":[]}]}
