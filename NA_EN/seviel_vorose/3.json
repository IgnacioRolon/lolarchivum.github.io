(I agree with this point)\n2) Late game damage carries are doing too much damage in the early/mid game due to easier snowballing.\n\nSo, if this is the case, Vayne should have a high win-rate early-mid game, right? And since games that go until the early-mid game are becoming more popular, she should have an above-average win rate overall, right? \n\nHere's a problem. She doesn't, unless you consider a 48.93% win rate above average. \n\nAccording to op.gg, Vayne has the 15th highest win-rate of ADCs in games that last under 25 minutes. That's pretty good... if it wasn't out of 16 marksman. That's right, Vayne has the SECOND-LOWEST win rate out of any ADC in games that end in less than 25 minutes.\n\nWow.\n\nBetween 25-30 minutes isn't much of a help either; she's 11th. Once we get past 30 minutes, a.k.a once she's reaching her 3 items, she tops the win-rate charts. Which isn't surprising, since she's a hyper carry and all. The point here is that the statistics prove she does MUCH worse when games last for 29 minutes or shorter. Oh, which is exactly against what the majority of the boards is saying!\n\nHere's the kicker; any talk about late-game carries doing too much damage early will be hyperbolism, because it does NOT happen often. If they ARE doing too much damage in your game, then your bot lane probably played really poorly and gifted those kills and gold over. Remember, lane kills should almost NEVER happen if the laners are of equal skill value, unless there's a gank. In most games nowadays, Vayne doesn't have the time to reach her three items, and the game ends before Vayne can get online.\n\nSo let's stop talking about this like it happens all the time. It doesn't.","replies":[]},{"poster":"WolfChases","date":"2017-11-26T13:49:30.364+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":4,"body":"He can't.

If Vayne attacks 3 times, she deals 12% of max HP as true damage. So to be 3-shotting a tank, she also needs to deal 88% if their HP in physical damage, or almost 30% per AA. This means that, post armor, she has to do more than 1000 damage each attack. You&#x27;ll agree that this is pretty much impossible unless Vayne is insanely fed and tank was AFK with disadvantage in both levels and gold.\n\nI agree that vayne is annoying, but her damage isn't the problem.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"OP Garen Support","date":"2017-11-26T13:04:49.462+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"My 5000K HP tank Sion got deleted in less then 2 seconds against Vayne.","replies":[{"poster":"ZephyrDrake","date":"2017-11-26T14:31:33.990+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=OP Garen Support,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Fzp9hoWE,comment-id=0004000000000001,timestamp=2017-11-26T13:04:49.462+0000)\n>\n> My 5000K HP tank Sion got deleted in less then 2 seconds against Vayne.\n\ngive me a replay or it didn't happen","replies":[{"poster":"DarkRooster","date":"2017-11-26T21:59:47.361+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"It does happen and almost every game","replies":[]},{"poster":"OP Garen Support","date":"2017-11-26T20:38:00.359+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Here you go \n\nhttps://streamable.com/ox6rj\n\nI was wrong it took 4-5 seconds she killed 2 other people first.","replies":[{"poster":"PB4UAME","date":"2017-11-27T02:49:49.777+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Jesus, the physical damage per auto alone was over 500 each hit, against a lategame looked like full build tank.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Asudurga","date":"2017-11-26T16:21:19.576+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"I am sick of {{champion:29}}  having such a short detection radius compared to his range and Burst Per Second.
