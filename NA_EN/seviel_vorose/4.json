The simple fact this post presents, a fact that has been true for a very long time, is that against an AP champion hexdrinker is a stupidly gold efficient item that can GUARANTEE absolute safety in a 1v1 scenario with no mechanical counterplay or skill required. Just simplistic brain dead stats. Mages aren't supposed to counter assassins? Fine, what about something like Fizz VS talon/zed? \n\nOnce an AD mid laner grabs hex it becomes impossible to kill them. Zed and Talon will come out even in a trade and have the power to turn a trade into an all in. in an all in you definitely won't kill them so the only choice is to play the lane passively at that point. This is also a pointless way to go about it because both of them have power ranged abilities to attempt to poke at you until they can set you up for a kill. The disadvantage only grows as the game goes on when they start stacking lethality items and start to massively out damage you because once again AD champions have access to a powerful line of items that there is no comparison for in AP itemization.

That was true before and Riot specifically went out of their way to make it even more true with the assassin update. They want assassins to be difficult to play. If the kit is inherently already hard to use, they can have a break on the item being brain dead.\n\nAP assassins getting the short end of the stick doesn't stop the argument. It just means that AP assassins need to stop existing. If Riot wants to appropriately balance their game they should normalize the assassin class and make them all AD. \n\n\"Once an AD mid laner grabs hex it becomes impossible to kill them\". This isn't an issue. You don't need to kill your lane opponent. You can keep them at bay by softening them up with damage from range and then just out CS them and move on with your life. There is no reason to fight a battle you know you can't win. Thankfully, you have the range and the CC to avoid the fight altogether.\n\n\"Once again AD champions have access to a powerful line of items that there is no comparison for in AP itemization\"\n\nThat's the fucking point of my original post. Do not compare items for two classes. They are separate. They are not equal. There should be no comparison. They have different roles, different goals, different reasons for being picked. Assassins have higher damage on their items. Yes. That is because mages have more damage in their kits. If I drop Tibbers on three enemy champions he will do over 600 damage instantly. The only assassin who has that much raw AOE damage in their kit is Katarina and Evelynn, and both of them are a lot easier to counter or avoid than Annie. \n\nDo not compare mages to assassins. This is the point I am making. This is the point Riot understands. That is why no one does anything about Hexdrinker no matter how many times you cry, no matter how many threads you make. They already know that mages are better than assassins in terms of utility and AOE, they don't need to worry that assassins have raw single target damage and sustain.","replies":[{"poster":"NineTailedMystic","date":"2017-11-27T23:03:47.943+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":1,"body":">\"Once an AD mid laner grabs hex it becomes impossible to kill them\".

First one is allright. Zed should have an advantage against Syndra, but he should also be able to die if outplayed. What OP posted is the second one - Zed simply picked a ~~mastery~~ rune and bought a cheap item, and now Syndra literally can't do anything no matter how good she is. If Zed decides to rush on her when he comes back, she's dead no matter how well she plays - you can't outplay a shitload of free defensive boosts. There is absolutely zero skill and effort involved from Zed in order to become all but unkillable by any mage. You can't possibly claim that is fair.\n\nStopwatch is also an absolutely terrible early buy. First of all, it's a highly snowbally meta - meaning that spending 600 gold on an item that gives zero stats is putting a giant neon sign over your head saying \"team please carry me, I just put myself insanely behind by throwing 600 gold down the drain when I need them the most\". That's 3 kills worth of gold. If Zed gets 3 kills, he snowballs the game. If Syndra gets them, she might survive a single all-in. Second, it's a ONE use item - aside from paradox of spending 600 gold to deny a single kill worth 200, it leaves you with a literal dud in your inventory. Meanwhile your opponent spent his 600 gold on actual stats, crushing any hope you might have had of fighting him.\n\nImagine if instead of Hexdrinker there was an item that built into Maw and gave a one-time shield with zero stats. Who in their right mind would ever buy it? Oh, and free stopwatch is only a 300g discount on Zhonyas instead of 600.\n\nRiot is all high on words like \"counterplay\" or \"interactivity\". So where are those in Hexdrinker+Orb combo? Where is counterplay to negating a massive part of my burst without even having to press a button? And why should I even try to interact with an opponent who gets to be unkillable with zero skill or effort involved? He can kill me easily, I can't kill him at all - so why even bother with anything other than passively farming (you know, the thing Riot also hates and has repeatedly nerfed champions able to do that very effectively).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Have a Nice Game","date":"2017-11-28T05:01:06.648+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Outplay should not be zero effort.
