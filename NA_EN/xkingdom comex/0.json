I had the CLG icon equipped but it didn't work. I pressed CTRL + 6 to see if it would work but it didn't. I played on Lee Sin which i have mastery 6 and Ivern (no mastery). Lee Sin showed the mastery 6 but nothing else.\n\nI've tried changing the spellbind to C to no avail.\n\nIf this isn't possible and i can't spam the emote, i'd like a refund of RP as i feel i've been heavily ripped off because i saw this the last few seasons.\n\nCan anyone help?\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"pachiporomari","date":"2017-09-01T16:15:17.480+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe I'm missing something here, but after checking the bundle on the store I'm a bit confused as to where you saw there was going to be an emote included when you buy the NA LCS Summer Icons bundle. If you have a link to where we mention it for **this** season, that would be awesome to see so we can double-check and make sure that's working properly. There's a chance that an emote could still pop up as we get closer to Worlds, but I don't want to make any promises.\n\nIf it turns out there isn't an emote provided as you desired, you can always [send us a ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and we'll look into seeing what we can do for that refund. Let me know if you have any other questions :)","replies":[{"poster":"XKingdom ComeX","date":"2017-09-02T14:20:25.695+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hiya Pachi,\n\nErrr, you're correct. I didn't read anywhere that the bundle came with emote's in game. I merely assumed so because at one point, i saw someone use the emote and was really happy with it. Therefore, i bought them out of impulse and now am feeling a bit sad that the emote's aren't there. I looked up online and people said that all you needed to do was equip the icon and press CTRL + 6. Now i feel a bit sad :(\n\nWould it be best to submit a ticket?","replies":[]}]}]}
