I've asked him whether he has computer issues , the right information , caps lock , number lock , etc. He replied that he had everything in place and even sent for a password reset , which hasn't arrived yet.  I just would like this to be publicly known because he is a paying customer in a free to play game. Thank you for your time.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-23T20:59:28.836+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Suck to hear about your friend having issues logging in, but I'd like to help!
