Here it is my Ziggs splashart. Originally it had Annie and Tibbers too in the background, but i was not able to make them at their best, so i decided to erase them until a drawing skill level up. I've started drawing with photoshop some months ago, so ALL of my skills are not the best XD After the Dino Gnar skin i thought to add to mine a zip too, gloves that doesen't fit the outfit but nice \"kitten shoes\" just to make Jinx fantasies come true and make her face explode of happiness. \n\nAs you can see i don't know what to write but stupid things so if you have suggestions for the background, the skin or my grammar i will appreciate that. Enjoy!
