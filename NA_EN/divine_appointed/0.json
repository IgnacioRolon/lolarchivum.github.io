For me personally I&#039;ve from an all time 80% win rate out of 40-50 games strait down to 70%. I couldn&#039;t understand why. Then when I saw that his overall win rate had dropped since patch 6.19 it made more sense but I don&#039;t see where he specifically got nerffed? Is there something I&#039;m building that got nerfed or what. Cuz right now he&#039;s seeming very weak.","replies":[{"poster":"dunder kill","date":"2016-11-05T01:55:06.029+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because Xin doesnt work outside bronze","replies":[{"poster":"xxxDogmanxxx","date":"2016-11-05T09:33:48.084+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I got to Diamond in my main account one-tricking Xin Zhao, though I have since moved to Graves to climb to Master Tier.
