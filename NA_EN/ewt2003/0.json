Right now Fiddlesticks is on sale (ends tomorrow) and I have 755 IP, half of his IP is 675. I closed and re-opened League, went to his information page and tried there, nothing ever works, for any champion i want to buy on sale. But if i have enough IP to buy them with their full price when they are on sale, i still have half of their price back, so i need their entire price just so i use half to buy them. Any way to fix this?","replies":[{"poster":"EWT2003","date":"2016-08-29T01:12:28.019+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i need help by tonight, sale ends tomorrow","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-29T21:01:44.632+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"*Lew* is correct. The sales only affect the RP purchase price, **not** the IP purchase price. This means that anything that's **on sale** that you can purchase with both RP and IP will be the same price in IP all the time, but will have the RP purchase price reduced.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lew","date":"2016-08-29T01:34:33.324+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Champions only go on RP sales not IP and [Fiddlesticks ](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/store/sales/champion-and-skin-sale-0826-0829-0)is currently 292 RP.","replies":[]}]}
