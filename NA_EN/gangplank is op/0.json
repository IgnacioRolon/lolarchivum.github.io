He can stack everything on the map but those two things.\n\nIt gets down voted immediately by the community and off the front page within hours. \n\nMaybe a Riot staff members has seen these threads and has already issued a past response, but I was wondering if this is intentional or a bug?\n\nI have never received an official response in any of my past threads and as a {{champion:75}} player I feel like this is a thematic game-play consistency issue or it is a bug.\n\nCan this be fixed or is it intentional? Is it a coding issue?\n\nThank you for your time!","replies":[]}]}]}
