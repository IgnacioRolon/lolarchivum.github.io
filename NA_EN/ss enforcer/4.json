I was gonna try her out.\n\nShe's a good example of why CertainlyT is one of the most reviled champion designers in the entirety of Riot's staff.\n\nShe has free mobility with her passive that procs off of her Q and her auto attacks (BUT SHE LOSES THE ABILITY TO CANCEL AUTOS HOW HORRIFYING) that makes her one of the most, if not most mobile champion in the game given that it requires absolutely nothing from her outside of a half-thought of where to hop to.\n\nKalista is also the only AD champion in the game with infinite damage potential on an activated nuke that stacks. Unlike Twitch (which is stacked at 7 iirc) or Vayne (Which procs at 3), Kalista can just continue to barrage you with spears while hopping around like a \"deranged kangaroo on crack\" as a previous poster said. Vayne's Silver Bolts doesn't proc off a Runaan's Hurricane, and Twitch's Expunge only has seven stacks and doesn't slow the victim of the proc anymore to my knowledge. Hell, even THIS GUY --> {{champion:110}}  only gets three stacks to proc his nuke as well.\n\nThen we have the ultimate and virtually free wards + the % of Health nuke that's offered to her and her Oathsworn, which are problematic but not nearly as unhealthy as her jumps or the damage on her E being nigh infinite so long as she doesn't die within the first second of a team fight starting.\n\nI can say without a doubt in my mind that as far as game designers go, CertainlyT is one of my least favorite.

Ugh.\n\nclearly the soul stacking mechanics is what make thresh such a good top tier pick :^), they are some additional stats yes, but not the same as vlad, that you used for your example, who just get stats because he is buildign other stats. Thresh has to get into the creep wave to collect his souls, it put him often in a position where the opponent adc can poke him almost for free.\n\nwhere you see toxic design, i see interesting new design that enhance the fun of the game, each their own i guess, but its certainly(T) less boring then farming simulator Nasus for instance (even vlad that you named, is basically push wave, sustain, push wave pool if ganked and deals aoe in teamfight. that's not really the most exciting gameplay around)\n\ni dont get the asymmetric argument as well ?  Do you mean you expect 123 champion to have similar kits/play style ? Yes there is different champion that do different things ???\n\nLike most people that are just upset at a champion, you are mistaking her jump for a blink, in fact its closer to a dash then a flash. not the same, as in you can intercept her in movement. Recently, in LCS out of all place, we saw an ahri place a charm on a kalista and destroy her, because the ahri was able to guess where Kalista was jumping to! Remeber these are also pro that have their live income on the line, and they wouldnt pick kalista if the likes of Vi and Kalista are open to grab. This is because, for Kalista to do her Rend (E) damage, she needs to be able to freely auto champions. If you don't think about the champion you pick into Kalista, then guess what you misplay the draft phase of the game ^^ gotta learn to improve that!\n\nKalista doesnt build CDR, so 90 to 60 sec is about right for her ultimate, between rank 1 and 3, Now lets look at the other 3 utility focus adc@16\n\n{{champion:22}}  Enchanted Crystal Arrow (R) : 80 cd MAGIC DAMAGE:  600 (+ 100% AP) SPLASH DAMAGE: 300 (+ 50% AP) up to 3.5sec stun, 50% slow aoe\n{{champion:110}}  Chain of Corruption (R) 70  cd MAGIC DAMAGE: 350 (+ 100% AP) Root for 2sec spread to champion that stay for 2 sec in range (600)\n{{champion:15}} On the Hunt (R) 80 cd  80% AS while ricochet is on, 60% move speed for her and her team for 6 sec and then decay to 20% for 2 sec after that\n(No i'm not saying these champion are as good as Kalista, they have other parameters to consider, that make them not really as wanted/top tier pick)\n\nSo not too far off in term of CD compared to the others, but theirs directly increase damage (by either doing damage, giving passive as, or procing other damage source (for Varus)) while Kalista doesnt have damage attached to her ult. What it does is launching the oathsworn to the a direction knockbacking opponent there for up to 2sec but also putting the support in a relativly bad spot if it wasnt executed properly. It actually require teamwork.
