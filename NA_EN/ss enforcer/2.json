The player has given up.\n2. They have tremendous lag.\n3. They have never played this champion before and cannot decide which items to buy.\n\nIn this case, it sounds like #2 seemed to be the case. A better internet speed would increase Nami's reaction time and allow her to leave base early. Bad computers can spit players up to a full minute late (and even more) into the game (which was probably the case in this game).","replies":[{"poster":"Leadpaintchips","date":"2015-12-23T18:56:31.813+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the full minute was divided up into smaller bits, 5-10 seconds in the fountain at a time, before minute 20.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"PROJECT MaXym","date":"2015-12-23T14:13:39.536+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"That's why solo q is shit, cuz most players are like this Nami.","replies":[{"poster":"GetMariahCarried","date":"2015-12-23T22:16:55.892+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The PROBLEM with THAT statement, is that it can be interpreted almost the same as Nami's logic. \"Most players are like Nami\".

Thankfully, I ignored their raging and just entertained them with positivity. You'd be surprised how much coaching a bad player can change the outlook of the game, but I don't do it where it seems like I'm angry so that I don't tilt said player further. I've won a lot of ranked games because of that one thing. I once had a team filled of like 3 toxic players and we ended up winning after my friend and I coached the team into making better plays. They were still salty and toxic in the end, but at least we won right? lol","replies":[]},{"poster":"Snake Town","date":"2015-12-23T16:00:31.661+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There were like 0 wards from anyone on that team XD","replies":[]}]}
