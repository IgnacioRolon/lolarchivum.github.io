Now, I have been trying all day different troubleshoots to get my client to allow me to login. I enter my username and password correctly, then it brings me the \"Logging on...\" Pop up, then after about 30 seconds, it says \"**Connection Error** Connection Failure: Unable to connect to the PVP.net server. Information regarding what may have cause this error can be found here. Service availability can be viewed on the League of Legends Server Status web page.\" I have tried it on my other account too, and still no luck. I have switched to a different region and I am successful on logging in to an account. So I know it is not my client. Knowing this, I still continued to repair corrupted files just to make sure. I have restarted my computer, modem,  everything. I am running wired straight from modem with nothing else connected to the modem. Please, If anyone knows anything about what the problem may be, Please contact me.

Our network technicians have reached out to Centurylink's and we have an open ticket with them so we can collaborate and track down the core cause and a permanent fix. I definitely recommend referring to the thread Rineyy linked to stay up to date on the issue. \n\nFor now, you should be able to bypass the issue by using a Virtual Private Network (VPN) such as [Hotspot Shield](https://www.hotspotshield.com/) or [Cyberghost](http://www.cyberghostvpn.com/en_us) to reroute your connection to the server. Let me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kürama","date":"2016-08-03T23:53:44.807+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is your ISP Century Link?","replies":[{"poster":"Turtle2funky","date":"2016-08-04T00:08:00.170+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If it helps at all, I live in Texas.
