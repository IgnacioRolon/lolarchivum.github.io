That I understand I should get the 5 minute wait. Instead, it was a 15 minute wait. Haven't dodged at all for a long time before that. But then today, I am loading into Champion Select on ranked and my client crashes. Makes me wait 30 minutes, and makes me lose -10 LP. How can this be fixed?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-21T16:51:56.241+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Disconnecting during champ select, regardless of reason, will show as a 'dodge' to the server. Continuous dodges will result in both longer wait times each dodge, and a loss of LP in ranked.
