Just like Lol it should be free to play. You should be able to go throughout all of runeterra. Make different areas starting zones for different kinda classes and possibly races. \r\n\r\nRaces: Human. Yordle. Vastaya. \r\n\r\nClasses: Vanguard, Fighter, Slayer, Mage, Controller, and Marksmen. \r\n\r\nHuman: Vanguard, Fighter, Slayer, Mage, Marksmen.\r\n\r\nYorlde: Mage, Marksmen, Fighter, Vanguard, Controller.\r\n\r\nVastaya: Mage, Fighter, Controller, Marksmen, Slayer.\r\n\r\nStarting areas should be place by class or race. \r\nStarting areas: Demacia, Ionia, Noxus, Piltover, Zaun, and Freljord.\r\n\r\nThis is all i have so far, not really good at creativity. Although it seems basic, it should be an idea Riot should look at initially. I think it would be amazing to see a open world game of Runterra. Especially with all the lore we have coming from different champions and characters we seen through released comics. Riot and other people may look at this with negative feedback, but i think it would be a worth of a shot. \r\nThanks for reading, and keep climbing the ladder of legends.\r\n\r\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"Kurt Hyzan","date":"2018-06-15T19:39:46.950+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"WoW is really trash atm, in a state where only casu or oldies play it.
