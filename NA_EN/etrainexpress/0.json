Void Staff will boost your damage against tanks significantly by penetrating their MR (though it doesn't help much against health stackers) and it will increase your damage to squishy targets by a decent amount too. \n----------------------\nThough, much of the time you just don't adapt your build against them specifically.  The primary role of many mages is to bust squishy targets; if you itemize too heavily against the tank, then you may not have the damage to do that during teamfights or skirmishes.","replies":[]}]}
