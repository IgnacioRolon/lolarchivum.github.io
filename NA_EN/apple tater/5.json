I'm not sure if Riot has seen any recent pro play games, but 1 q which has AoE one shots, I'm sorry but that's crappy of riot to think a champ with good mobility, can use ANY summoner spell and item in the game is 'not broken'.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Souksim","date":"2016-08-23T09:00:45.524+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well i have a question about MMR.I have 2 accounts the one im posting right now and my old one.On the old one when i got to lvl 30 i started playing ranked and in my surprise i got paired with plat 5+ sometimes golds in my placement matches.Can you tell me how did that happened?
