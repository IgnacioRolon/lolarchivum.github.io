These issues often occur when there are problematic local network configurations or issues with your ISP routing. I strongly recommend working through our [connection guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) as a first step to ensure your local settings are good and aren't conflicting with League. \n\nLet me know if those steps caused any change.","replies":[{"poster":"Pshock13","date":"2016-08-09T21:55:55.445+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So I went ahead and ran Netalyzr with the results telling me that there are burst of packet loss.

You can do this by pulling the power plugs on your modem and router, then plugging them back in after 60 seconds. You'll also want to restart your PC so it can establish a fresh connection to the network. Run another network analysis and see if anything has changed. If it hasn't let me know.","replies":[{"poster":"Pshock13","date":"2016-08-10T16:05:08.936+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, I've done that before.

Any commands I put in are ignored and after about 20-30 seconds of this lag everything catches up (usually resulting in my death). I've seen similar posts from years before with no solution...not even an idea to a solution. We're no on patch 6.15, you'd think this would be addressed at least, if not fixed.\n\nMy friends are tired of me dropping out after one or two games cause I get so frustrated with this lag. Everything else runs just fine on my computer, ping stays around 40-60 while these spikes happen (INB4 stop downloading porn) If it were so easy, I wouldn't be on the forums.","replies":[]}]}
