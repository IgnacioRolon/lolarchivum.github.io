Do you think they don't already know that when they see the gray screen all the time?  Did you get annoyed by their constant death?  That's an emotion.  Don't get emotional and tell people to stop feeding (99.9% they already know it) and you won't run into those problem (at least not caused by you).  It's not helpful, provides zero useful advice, and just cause problems all because you got emotionally annoyed at them.  Play your own game and if you want them to stop, actually provide useful advice and don't be a dick about it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Yin Yang Taoist","date":"2020-01-14T21:37:46.048+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Grand Starfallin,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=1EVwlbHV,comment-id=,timestamp=2020-01-13T23:39:32.002+0000)\n>\n>reports over simple words not even toxicity then don't play ranked at the very least, half these kids more emotional than my girlfriend any week of the month!\n\n{{sticker:sg-miss-fortune}} \n\nThat's how it is.
