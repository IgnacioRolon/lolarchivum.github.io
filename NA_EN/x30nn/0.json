Everything works great browsers and all steam games work great but when I open LoL and I login it takes about 2-3 minutes to log me in. And then when I'm in client and want to play some games It takes also 2-3 minutes to create a lobby. Then when I finnally come in game lobby I mean draft pick I can't ban or choose any champions because I can't see them. There is only black window where champions should be.\r\nGuys please help me I put a lot of time in LoL and now this happens. \r\nThank you for all help! :D","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-01T20:17:39.880+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We've been noticing a lot of EU players having packet loss issues, and it seems to possibly be isolated to a specific ISP node that your connection is being routed through.
