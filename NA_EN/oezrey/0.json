I uploaded my logs but all their suggestions for fixing the issue were unhelpful- I always keep other programs closed, I already tried restarting my router and computer, and my wireless connection is perfectly fine and there haven't been any issues until today","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Pandemic Punch","date":"2016-05-17T02:34:04.316+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am having ping issues as well. It is normally around 41 but it is currently around 180-200 with fluctuations. There is something wrong on Riot's end as my net is in the best state it has ever been in, and my ping is fine everywhere else.","replies":[]}]}
