It is most bothersome in Champ select. When I'm setting up runes and masteries it will freeze about 60% of the time. I was punished for dodging like 3 times yesterday because my client froze before or while I was pick/banning. Its been doing this for the past couple days. I tried reinstalling the client today, but I still say my chat disconnect so I assume that if I jump into a champ select it will continue to have problems.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-07T22:19:40.368+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You need to have a consistent connection to stay on the client and stay in-sync during champion select, otherwise you'll get left behind.  You'll want to run through the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to tune up your connection.
