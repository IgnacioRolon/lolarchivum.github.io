They definitely nerfed riftwalk because Kassa was too safe like you said, but not because he was able to jump in and then out before being in danger (which obviously it's not true since the CD was at least 3 secs, and full AP kass in 3secs explodes).\nThe reason was that all the pros were either 1) hitting Q/E from max range and then R away if someone wanted to retaliate 2) jumping from nowhere at Q/E max range and then walking away impossible to catch due to silence + slow.\n\nWhat they wanted to do with the change was exactly to force him to jump in the middle of the enemy team to do the dmg and then go out. Something they failed miserably at doing so since 1) the ulti does almost no DMG 2) they removed the AS from the passive (man, did I loved it. In lane it always granted a kill when the enemy tried to all-in you. Almost no one knew of it).\n\nKass now is kind of a fine state, the problem is that they nerfed the ulti (which now has basically a 20sec CD, since you'll burn all your mana if you use it more often) AND the MS.
