Why does everyone think zed is so bad? There are many other useful bans I'd rather choose than a ban full of mid champs. Think of the other lanes that will face trouble if they have let's say blitz and you don't have a morg. I'd say 75 percent of the games I play have people constantly picking champs that they think are op against their main champ or just op overall. Plus anyone ever see a Ryze against a zed? Ryze is better than him late game with his tankiness and his stun.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Leblancs Boob","date":"2015-01-08T23:31:00.111+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well theres no ban phase in teambuilder..
