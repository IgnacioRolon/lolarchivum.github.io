This is why Thunderlord's is used most.","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"The current mastery system is in a crisis.  The most obvious symptom is the reign of Thunderlord&#039;s decree, but I think the problem is a much deeper then one over powered keystone.\r\n\r\nThe issue is the universality of the cunning tree and thunderlord&#039;s decree.  In this tree you get sustain, utility, and damage.  Arguably as much damage as you get in Ferocity.  18 point in Cunning in universally useful, while some of the other keystones have some niche users (Grasp of the Undying is silly good top) the fact remains that every champ in the game is comfortable with thunderlords and 18 cunning.  You still have 12 points to hit the high notes of the other trees, so if you&#039;re a tank you still can double down on sustain and beef with 12 points in Cunning, and if you&#039;re anyone else you can get more damage and sustain in Ferocity.\r\n\r\nRight now the best thing Riot could do is take a good look at the offensive options that are split between Ferocity and Cunning.  Resolve is in a good place right now with a clear strength and cost.  But the identity of the other trees is mixed to the point that one is clearly better then the other for the majority of users.  To be honest I&#039;d take the sustain masteries out of ferocity and the damage masteries out of cunning and swap the two.  They&#039;d have to be renamed but it would at least resolve their game-play identities.","replies":[{"poster":"Best KhaZix Void","date":"2015-12-29T03:11:22.237+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, thunderlords is used most because ferocity tree is garbage and over half the keystones are garbage, has nothing to do with the cunning tree by itself, they need to work around it, not just change the cunning tree and defeat the purpose of the mastery tree changes in the first place.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LordGeovanni","date":"2015-12-29T06:51:12.528+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The cunning tree is used because of the burst form thunderlords which would be okay if it only worked once in a while but since 4-5 people taking it its ridiculous burst from everyone the only way they can really get that under control is to have the cd both on the champion useing it and the champion hit. and if it becomes useless they and lower the keep the cd on the champion that activates tunderlords 10s and the champion that got hit by thunderlords cd can be 5-7 seconds","replies":[{"poster":"DustyElLion","date":"2015-12-29T07:36:19.138+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's used because Thunderlord's is generically good and easy to use.

In either case you're comparing two offensive option - just one is more raw damage output whereas the other is better dueling potential. \n\nEach of the trees should have a clear identity. It's easy to make a tree's identity as offense or defense. It's hard to come up with a third unique identity that players will value in the game. I feel like Utility did a better job as a weaker alternative that could have been buffed than cunning does as a competing option that will frequently make all players choose whichever is stronger at the time.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DustyElLion","date":"2015-12-29T00:05:01.217+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well now no one goes deep ferocity.   League of legends, at its very essence, is making your opponent hit 0 hp before you do.  You do that with more damage, or more sustain/tank.    We have a Tanky tree, but now we have two offensive trees, one of which is currently better then the other in the majority of cases.  You have to differentiate these trees in some way.  Or at the very least nerf cunning's last 6 points so that its very clear that if you want DAMAGE you go ferocity.   But then you might be back in the same situation where no ones goes deep into the cunning tree.\n\nLet's face it, Stormrider's Surge isn't popular even among its target audience and wind speaker's is extremely pigeon-holed.   So if you do nerf precision and Thunderlord's then you have a tree that isn't worth maxing.  Again.  Perhaps take Thunderlord's to ferocity to replace Warlord's bloodlust (its only used by 2 champs and its synergy with them is silly strong) then add a new more utility focused keystone to cunning in its place.  If they insist on it being an assassin tree then some kind of CDR reset mechanic would be interesting, tough to balance, but useful to many champs.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
