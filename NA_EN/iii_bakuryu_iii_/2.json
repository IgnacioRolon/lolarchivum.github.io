I&#039;m a cs player who doesn&#039;t fight in lane unless its a Free trade but I get poked down so easily now.  \r\n \r\n Thank you and Have a Good One","replies":[{"poster":"Choo6","date":"2016-07-23T07:20:57.474+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I assure you the anal beads have the +50% base heath regen now and not the +3hp per 5 secs.\n\nI recommend u use them on Heimerdinger (buy 2-3 of them) because he has the highest base HP regen ever from level 1 - 18. Your health regen will almost be the equivalent of a weak health potion passively in lane.","replies":[{"poster":"Evewynn","date":"2016-07-23T10:02:04.659+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"HP regen heim is secret cancer, please do not make it spread","replies":[{"poster":"The Last Ballad","date":"2016-07-23T19:19:25.567+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I love it when I have to go top.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
