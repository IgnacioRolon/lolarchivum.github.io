Maybe it’s a problem with my school’s WiFi, but it’s been completely fine up until this week which leads me to believe it’s a problem with the patch. Does anyone else have similar \nissues or is it just me?\n\nLeague is the only game where my ping is a problem, other multiplayer games like overwatch and pubg sit at 19 consistently.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-11-02T20:37:08.810+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you might be getting packet loss here, which your ping might not pick up.  Run a [log reader](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743-Connection-Troubleshooting-Log-Reader) for the impacted games to really know for sure, and let me know what you find out.  Your wifi on a heavy school traffic could definitely be a culprit too, and trying a wired connection if possible could really help rule out that possibility.","replies":[{"poster":"Cozmix","date":"2017-11-08T21:42:24.222+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"this has been happening to me aswell my ping used to be solid 30ms now its spikes non-stop all game between 30 and 120 very hard to play and this just happened suddenly.
