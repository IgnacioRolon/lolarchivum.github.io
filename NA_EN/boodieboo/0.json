Its all normal if I dont scroll up/down or sideways but when I, for example, Move my mouse down to move the screen down, it doesnt do it in a a fluent way like I see it happening with other players on twitch or how I remember it used to be before I had stopped playing for some time. If I change the sensitivity in options to be a little more or less, it still doesnt move smoothly like it should be, it kind of seems like its edgy when it moves. Its really hard to explain without showing a visual lol.  I am just wondering if anyone else having such issues. \r\nMy settings is almost defualt other than a few button mapping, and video settings is set to 1920-1080p and borderless.

Welcome!  There could be some config mess up not responding to your input properly, let me know if a reset helps:\n\nLog into the game client.\nNavigate to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config\nDelete the file  named **game.cfg** and **persistedsettings.json**\nGo into a custom game and verify that settings have saved properly.
