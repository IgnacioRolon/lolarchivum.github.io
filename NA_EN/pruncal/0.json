Riot does not offer the ability for people to call and get help on an issue, the least they can do is be quick with responses to tickets. My personal opinion is that every ticket should get a response within the first 24 hours. Amazing customer service would get back to you within 12 hours. This is not a small game that is not very profitable, there is no excuse to not have enough people helping with customer service. People put a lot of money into their accounts the least you could do is be responsive to our problems. The players deserve the quick response. Does anyone else see this as being a common problem?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-25T01:48:11.167+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ticket response time greatly depends on the current size of their queues. For example, currently we're taking care of the last bit of your shop issues that popped up, so the response time might be a little longer than what's common. Typically, tickets have answers within 14 hours (average NA region response time).","replies":[]}]}
