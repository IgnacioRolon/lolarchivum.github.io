What I did was i gave my gift card to my brother and it would not let him gift it to me instead it tells him he must buy it for me. Is there any way you can get it back from him?  His Summoner name is OverHeatKing. And i have his complete permission to do so.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-22T17:22:14.081+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not sure if we can assist with this once the card has been used, but you can reach out to us in a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) to see.
