The issue I&#039;m having is that with the new Xerath skin, players can no longer spam the dance animation and get Xerath&#039;s overhead animation thing. Also, on stock Xerath I can retarget my Q very quickly. It feels sluggish on the new skin when I try changing direction too quickly","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Whist","date":"2015-04-28T18:33:55.268+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"The dance spam is fixed internally as of this morning and will probably be shipped out this next patch.\nDance spam is one of the most important things when playing Xerath as it separates the good from the great. Thank you for discovering this, a huge weight I didn't know existed has been lifted from my shoulders and I can rest easy knowing very soon GotS Xerath players will have their dance back.","replies":[{"poster":"lightdragoon88","date":"2015-04-28T19:28:16.451+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good.

D: We'll see why he's not doing it anymore 'cause that's one of the best parts about playing Xerath! \n\nWe'll also take a look at why the skin may be feeling a bit sluggish.\n\nThanks for the report!","replies":[{"poster":"FreeTacoz","date":"2015-04-28T19:24:04.489+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My main concern with the Q is that on stock Xerath I can aim it one direction and then instantly re-target it to surprise people. Maybe it's because I'm a bit rusty, but yesterday the GotS skin didn't appear to have the same response. Thank you for the help :)","replies":[]}]}]}
