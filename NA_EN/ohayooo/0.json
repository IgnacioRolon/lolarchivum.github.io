And of course you guys told me that I shouldn't give out my personal details to someone else but I still did it, so the problem is now that I'm back from a transfer school and wanted to play some games with my friends again, but now since I'm banned and have spend a lot of money in this game I'm not able to play with them or play this game again...\r\n\r\nIs there any way to give me an unban? Cause I can pay for it or won't the same thing in the future.\r\nI hope you guys understand my situation and help me out soon.\r\n\r\nOhayooo EUW","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-27T01:22:45.504+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Typically once an account has been banned for the use of third-party programs it cannot be lifted for security reasons.
