Obviously, I favor my computer but although I can play a custom with no ping problems on it, the moment I hit a PVP game or someone joins my custom, my ping hits 2000+ ping. And I have no clue why since my laptop runs the game just fine and has no problems with ping. Any solutions?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-29T03:49:23.437+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This could be caused by a bad network driver on your desktop (computer).
