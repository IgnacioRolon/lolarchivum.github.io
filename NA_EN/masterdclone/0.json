And this is me saying that as a OTP that gets banned every single clash. The scouting phase is exciting the champ select has so much yelling and the game itself is so tense because we are trying so hard, harder than I ever would in ranked because this matters so much more to most of us. This competitiveness makes noobs like us feel like pros and has once again made me fall in love with the game.\r\n~~~~\r\nI can't wait for tomorrow to try and get that first place","replies":[{"poster":"Bazerka","date":"2019-08-25T04:24:02.047+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"^ this. Im pretty sure the \"beta\" here (unlike betas for modes) isn't to determine _if_ we should make it permanent, but to make sure the game works when Clash is running :)","replies":[{"poster":"Kai Guy","date":"2019-08-25T04:44:09.072+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Nice. Competitive 5v5 completely removes the issue most players have with solo, the RNG teammates.  \n\nClash might be a good way to fix that issue. Y'all might want to run a poll at some point to find what % of your player base are folks like me who work non standard hours.  I would be a bit bummed out if the fact I don't do a 9-5 work week means I cant play the mode.\n\nFrom the strain y'all have every time you do it thou I think you guys got a good deal of work ahead of yourself getting it out of beta.

If Clash becomes only a bi-weekly thing on weekends, there's a 50-50 chance that I may never be able to play it\n{{sticker:sg-janna}} ","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Sukishoo","date":"2019-08-25T04:22:23.724+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is meant to be permanent eventually it it is still in testing.","replies":[{"poster":"INEEDmoreCOWbell","date":"2019-08-25T04:44:33.730+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"ya we are getting it but how many years you have to wait is still up for debate,","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Skaarl H Marx","date":"2019-08-26T03:05:34.257+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Dafuq this is getting down voted for, I know that it's in beta and is likely to stay but because of all the problems it had it might get pulled for a long time before it gets released fully","replies":[{"poster":"MasterDClone","date":"2019-08-26T03:21:59.368+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"it was getting up voted couple hours ago, probably some salty people whole went 0-2 in clash came by tbh","replies":[]}]}]}
