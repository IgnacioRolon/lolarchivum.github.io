[TRIED EVERYTING]","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"So uh... about 2 days ago I was playing some League of the Legends and took a bit of a break for about 3-4 hours, when I wanted to play again I just typed in my password and It wouldn't log me in it was just stuck on 'Authenticating...' then I tried restarting the client a couple of times that didn't work, tried restarting my PC, running League as an administrator and none of that worked, it was still getting stuck on 'Authenticating...'.\nThen I tried going to the forums/support site for some info on this whole thing and I couldn't open ANY of the League sites (even op.gg which was weird) then I went on YouTube and watched this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcK408L5oNg&amp;t=20s\nOf course that didn't do anything for me, then I tried looking for some other videos and they're all either the same thing or just people asking what's going on and then in the comments everyone would link the video I linked above. But when I did those things apparently I fixed the problem partially and I could now open the forums, today I can open the Support site too.\nFrom the forums I read this https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/Y4AbLx62-solution-rads-error-dns-problem-cant-access-riot-games-website-windows-xp78-macos and this http://forums.euw.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=2053745 which are basically the same thing with the video I sent just phrased differently and with some other small details that didn't matter anyway because they didn't help.\nToday I tried that Hextech Repair Tool since I finally got access to the support site and what do you know... It didn't help at all.\nI heard that reinstalling doesn't help either so I'm not about to try that unless someone with an actual understanding tells me to.\nOverall It's been 2 days and the DNS issue hasn't been solved by Riot, if that even is the problem that I'm having... So can anyone shed me some light here? Do I need to wait for the issue to get resolved on it's own (aka by Riot) or do I need to do something in specific, because so far I believe I did everything but reinstalling (which seems like a waste of time like the rest of the things I did).\nMy friends can access the game just fine, how come I don't get to play? It's a real big bummer I can't have fun with my friends for 2 days now... maybe even more.\nMaybe me doing all those things didn't even fix anything, maybe it was just Riot fixing it one by one and tomorrow or overmorrow would be when I can access League.\nhttps://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/275334351825272832/392691016060108800/unknown.png","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-12-19T21:34:18.074+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oof, those threads are super old!  Pretty sure well before we even had Riot Direct.  I have a feeling that either your routing or ports might be blocking you to the authentication server.  Try [Port Forwarding](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to see if that can fix this up.  \n\nIf that doesn't work, a traceroute can help us pinpoint where the block is occurring.  Download [WinMTR](http://winmtr.net/winmtr-v0-92-now-available/) and run a route to the game server: q.na1.lol.riotgames.com.  Run it for about 5 minutes, replace the IP address with dashes on the first two rows only, and let me know what you find.","replies":[{"poster":"Hankypoo","date":"2017-12-20T15:22:31.031+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I tried the whole WinMTR thing, didn't work.\nAnd unfortunately the stupid way internet providers and the companies of the routers work here in my country/town are kinda making it difficult to obtain my router's username and password so that Port Forwarding thing is either going to take some time to do or it's not gonna happen at all.\nIs there any other way of doing this? Is waiting for the issue to be resolved by Riot an option?\n\nBTW, I'm on Windows 10 and on the EUNE server (which can be seen on my name anyways but yeah)\n","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-12-20T16:16:26.854+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Gotcha!
