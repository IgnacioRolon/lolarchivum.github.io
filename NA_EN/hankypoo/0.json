It even causes in-game delay/lag which is very annoying when I'm trying to do... anything like play the game for f's sake.\r\nClient lag and unresponsiveness has been happening for about 2-3 days now and it's just unplayable, some people even tried the repair tool and it didn't help at all.\r\nDoes anyone know what's going on?","replies":[{"poster":"SunnyHeals","date":"2017-06-28T16:19:18.378+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I cant play LoL couse the client lags like hell and this continues for like 2 weeks the only way to play for me is via VPN.

This can cause you to lose sync or even left behind during champion select, as well as in-game.  \n\nMy suggestion would be to go over each step of the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to troubleshoot this towards a fix.  The HRT can fix game file problems, but not necessarily connection.
