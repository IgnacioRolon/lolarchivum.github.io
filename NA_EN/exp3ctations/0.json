Sport organizations have rules, many of them are about individuals and their actions.  This is not uncommon, they both can and will give out fines and suspensions to players for many things, including arguing, insulting, or mocking others.  An example is when a football player made a suggestive gesture lasting maybe a half of a second and was given a $10,000 fine for it.  Compare that half second to yours which includes all of the above.\n\nYou have received multiple, written warnings **directly from the official organization of this sport** about your history of actions in the game, telling you to cease your behavior but you chose to ignore those and continued.    Because of that, you got a suspension, again directly from the sports organizer.

But think of it as going to a community center or gym to play basketball.  It might be just a pickup game with a bunch of random people who also happen to be playing at that time, but you are still expected to follow the facility rules.\n\nMy advice, as someone who played varsity sports in high school, is to focus on the game, and focus on yourself.  If someone is harrassing you, mute them. It's not worth risking your account because someone else is in a pissy mood.  If someone is trolling, find something to practice:  warding, farming under pressure, etc.\n\nAnother bit of advice is to look for reasons to compliment your teammates.  Tell them thank you for that level one jungle leash.  Give a thumbs up if they set up a good gank for you.  Shifting focus like that will help you stay calmer, and it'll give your teammates more incentive to help you out and less reason to flame you.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Zombie Gerbil","date":"2019-04-10T05:59:18.238+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This was a justified ban.\nSorry, you're going to have to move on. \n\nThis game is probably isn't for you if you can't handle your emotions.","replies":[{"poster":"Exp3ctations","date":"2019-04-10T06:00:31.560+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":6,"body":"So me being mad is worth me losing 100$ worth of riot points and a chance to help my school? hwo is this fair","replies":[{"poster":"Zombie Gerbil","date":"2019-04-10T06:10:05.979+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, it's fair because you agreed to these terms before you even downloaded this game.\nAlways read the [Terms of Use](https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/legal/termsofuse) for every game before you agree to sign them. \nOtherwise, you would never be in this situation.
