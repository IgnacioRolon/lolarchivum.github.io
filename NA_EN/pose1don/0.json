You've done a lot of steps already that I thought of, but I also suggest the [permissions](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) guide.  This will make sure that nothing is blocking the game from accessing files.  Let me know if that helps!","replies":[]}]}
