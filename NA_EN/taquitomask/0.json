Or, when dragon or baron has been slain it freezes. Last but not least when i get ganked by anyone that comes in lane my game freezes. When i say freeze, i don't mean lag or a short freeze. I mean a freeze that normally last over 5 seconds. Sometimes even up to 20 seconds or so if a lot of chaos is going on. I'll add quickly that the client in champ select does it often as well and got me in low priority a few times as well as lost me so much LP. \r\nIs this a computer issue? If so, would a better graphics card do the most good, or a new cpu? It's an Intel i3 cpu and i believe it's running on the graphics built in to the cpu. Or is this a game issue? Please help me conquer the solution :)","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-30T03:56:07.926+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This sounds like you may have a very serious hardware or system driver issue going on.
