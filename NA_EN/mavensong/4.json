It's a game with dinosaurs. I got us our own server to screw around on.\n\n{{champion:86}} What in Laughing Fish is a dinosaur anyways? I thought that was just a skin for Gnar.\n\n{{champion:72}} You wouldn't know, but dinosaurs were a thing on Runeterra, long before humans or even yordles were a thing, for the most part they went extinct, very few dinosaurs still existed when ancient humans and yordles like Gnar first emerged, and for good reason: you fleshbags would have likely not gotten to where you are now if they were still around.\n\n{{champion:420}} (huffs) Nagakabouros tells me that dinosaurs were constantly in motion: it was always eat or be eaten.

(huffs defensively)\n\n{{champion:82}} Shyvana, these things supposedly covered the entirety of Runeterra. Hundreds of thousands of Cho'gath-sized lizards running around, and who knows how many of them were magical?\n\n{{champion:36}} (starts to play the game) Ah, Mundo's character has no items or clothes! Mundo only has boxers!\n\n{{champion:82}} It's called Ark: **Survival** Evolved. The whole point is you start with nothing and...\n\n{{champion:48}} Hahahahaha!
