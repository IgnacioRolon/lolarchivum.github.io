(One for each position)","subforum":"Memes & Games","up_votes":16,"down_votes":0,"body":"[](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/sites/default/files/upload/art/teambuilder-wallpaper.jpg)\n\n(As a simple guideline, try to stick to more traditional roles **Ex. Teemo Jg**.  Not 100% required, not that i can even stop you.)\n\nMy list is more for just champions I like in general rather than anything tactical.\n\nTop:  {{champion:92}} \n\nI dont really play her or anything but i just really like her character. Broken and trying to find her own way. I also kinda like champions that use autos in between abilities. I also have some respect for her mains, she does take a decent bit of skill to use proficiently. \n\nJungle: {{champion:113}} \n\nSej is a cold hearted fighter. She is extremely strong fighter and and wont take shit from ANYONE. She&#039;s actually my 3rd highest mastery champ. Thaaaat and she also made it on here cause she has **ONE** of the best skins in the game \n\nhttp://img05.deviantart.net/320e/i/2014/324/e/9/poro_rider_sejuani_by_polkadotzombie-d871i5b.png\n\nMid: {{champion:103}} \n\nThis should come as no surprise, I absolutely LOVE Ahri&#039;s character and lore. She&#039;s one of those champs i try to play solely because i like the character so much. I&#039;m not bad at her, but im not great xD\n\nADC: {{champion:22}} \n\nBit contrary to Sej here, Ashe was actually my first main (sitting at 2nd highest mastery). Since she was one of the first champs i played i  grew rather attached. That being said, i kinda stopped playing her much when i realized i suck at ADC.\n\nSupport: {{champion:37}} \n\nIf you didnt see this coming you must be Lee Sin. Sona is my current main and the champion that i have the MOST mastery points with. She has a special place in my heart. She&#039;s the one who really showed me the ropes and intricacies of the game. I knew basics with Ashe, but i learned so much more in depth with Sona. And i kinda feel similar to her sometimes, in the fact that i kinda feel without a voice to speak how i really feel sometimes. I am actually pretty horrible at expressing myself. So in that sense i kinda connect with her.\n\n(Sidenote: after reviewing my list i have basically made myself a Harem....)","replies":[{"poster":"KONO RUBICK DA","date":"2016-07-02T13:36:00.913+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":1,"body":"post your main x5\n\n/thread","replies":[{"poster":"ACENOX","date":"2016-07-02T13:42:36.719+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/899/185/a52.gif\n\nso, {{champion:37}} {{champion:37}} {{champion:37}} {{champion:37}} {{champion:37}} ?","replies":[{"poster":"KONO RUBICK DA","date":"2016-07-02T14:03:52.960+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:37}} {{champion:82}} {{champion:83}} {{champion:2}} {{champion:30}} \ni heard you liked music.","replies":[{"poster":"Mad King Hades","date":"2016-07-02T14:11:38.958+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"For once I agree with Rubick.","replies":[{"poster":"KONO RUBICK DA","date":"2016-07-02T14:13:37.532+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"then for once, i shall not post a sylar gif\n\nhttp://31.media.tumblr.com/e83bd2775d104bf48a4ef989ccb9f5eb/tumblr_n0cmv4j3Ck1rprtwjo1_500.gif","replies":[{"poster":"Mad King Hades","date":"2016-07-02T14:16:09.832+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://media.giphy.com/media/AeWoyE3ZT90YM/giphy.gif","replies":[{"poster":"Glory ln Death","date":"2016-07-03T02:38:32.693+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can't cage the Sylar!\nhttps://media.giphy.com/media/rJ3h5m6MaNKMg/giphy.gif\n... well, despite what this gif suggests.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"MavenSong","date":"2016-07-02T20:44:36.954+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Arcade {{champion:37}} \nDJ {{champion:37}} \nSilent Night {{champion:37}} \nPentakill {{champion:37}} \nMuse {{champion:37}}","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"ImTheSideKick","date":"2016-07-02T12:44:36.128+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":2,"body":"Teemo {{champion:17}} {{item:3111}} {{item:1413}} {{item:3512}}  {{item:3053}} {{item:3742}} {{item:3102}} jungle\nTeemo {{champion:17}} {{item:3020}} {{item:3151}} {{item:3285}} {{item:3157}} {{item:3135}} {{item:3089}}  middle\nTeemo {{champion:17}} {{item:3111}} {{item:3512}}  {{item:3022}} {{item:3071}} {{item:3078}} {{item:3091}} top\nTeemo {{champion:17}} {{item:3006}} {{item:3031}} {{item:3085}}  {{item:3036}} {{item:3026}} {{item:3153}} adc\nTeemo {{champion:17}} {{item:3111}} {{item:3050}} {{item:2045}} {{item:3092}} {{item:3512}} {{item:3060}}  support\n\nimagine the horror ","replies":[{"poster":"CasterGilgamesh","date":"2016-07-02T20:18:15.577+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol","replies":[{"poster":"Mig89","date":"2016-07-03T20:47:13.200+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thats terrifying XD\nAll the same skin and youd never guess which was hurting you","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"JayHog1992","date":"2016-07-02T12:57:58.576+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Top: Teemo {{champion:17}} Every yordle main needs a leader, and the captain fits the duty of stopping the enemy tanks from gaining any advantage over your team.\n\nJungle: Rumble {{champion:68}} Even with his top taken, he can still do some sweet ganks.
