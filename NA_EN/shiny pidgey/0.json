If you feel like you hit a wall, its because you're no longer good enough to advance. Focus on bettering yourself so you can impact the game more the next time around. You'll never see your teammates again, so their mistakes don't matter. Remember that if you see your team making mistakes, the enemy has the same tier players. They're making mistakes too.

That would be 25+LP per win and 2/3, just straight victories. I know some players are good AND lucky enough to hit a streak like that. But we are not discussing \"I deserve Plat why am I in bronze.\" we are discussing \"I am slightly better than bronze, it sucks that I have to play 100s of games to get out of bronze.\"\n\n6+6+6+6+9 = 33 games (assuming you can't get 34LP, assuming no skips). Looks like you played way too many games huh. \n\nI am not insulting you, or the poster. I am just saying playing 100s of games is not abnormal. It sucks, but it isn't abnormal.\n\nAlso, the system didn't predetermine you to be Silver 5. It UNDERANKED you into Silver5 to force you to climb. Your situation is completely different vs someone who is predetermined to be Bronze 5 and only gains like 16LP per win. That was what my reply was. \nYour MMR is probably placed higher than Silver5. So you were able to climb decently. I assume somewhere in the middle matches started getting tougher. Then they got more normal. But idk, I haven't played your games.\n\nActually let's see. You couldn't get out of Silver in 10 games per division. 100/5 = 20 games. Guess you belong in Silver, you are just lucky the system might let you escape. \nDo you see how your post makes no sense?","replies":[{"poster":"ShinkoMinori","date":"2017-04-28T23:39:17.077+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That counter goes for flex queue too... you should take the 10 games from provisionals as well from both queues so I actually have 85 ranked games together being around 20 of those for flex queue... \n\nBesides what I was saying about the 10 game thing was for bronze, because in my opinion is very hard to lose in bronze unless you are not carrying. In that case you are a masochist because relying on bronze to get out of bronze is naive.\n\nalso 10 games per division is around 50 games for 85 minus the 20 of the flex is like 65 games, to be fair my rank has been gold for the past 3 seasons so for me its harder silver than bronze. But in any case I only need 6 more wins to get gold so.... im not really that far.\n\nMy point about bronze stands, if you get 16 LP per win then the system is telling you that you belong in that elo. If you lose more LP than u win then you belong lower, if you gain the same then yeah you belong in that elo.","replies":[{"poster":"MysterQ","date":"2017-04-29T00:24:01.231+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But your point isn't right.","replies":[{"poster":"ShinkoMinori","date":"2017-04-29T00:54:45.947+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My point is: If you dont belong in that elo you climb fast, if it takes you 100 games in bronze and still cant get out specially if you are bronze 2... The game even rewards you for failing your promos with a free win... so there is no excuse if you are meant to climb you will climb. \n\nIf you are struggling to gain LP then you are doing something wrong or your skill isn't worth of higher rank. 100 games is a lot already and pretty much if you spent 100 games in a division or inbetween 3 divisions or even in a whole rank then yeah you wont get far.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Cocho","date":"2017-04-28T21:54:41.319+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"It depends on your approach to the game. \n\nIf you're actively trying to improve, watching educational twitch vods, free coaching, playing the right champs, and you're still in bronze.

If you want to truly master a champion One tricking is better, that is why I tell others to stick to one lane instead of trying to learn every lane (you can see my old posts where others say they main x champs in x lanes).\n\nBut I don't think I've done terrible. It was much slower than I wanted of course. \n\nI don't want to just ignore any advice, but I guess I have a bit of bad in me because I don't want to do a pure one-trick (because one-trick on my current supports would piss my team off or be boring (sorry sometimes winning if boring)). But at the same time, I only play a handful of supports and I try to stay only in support. You might think that is too many though.\nBy boring, I mean if I think the match-up is a losing one it is boring. If they have Soraka, my Janna is not going to do much in lane so I would consider it a boring match-up. But I will agree/admit I recently played an Ali game and told my team it has been too long and was not comfortable, but at the same time he made sense vs Rakan compared to my normal line-up.\n\nI am not trying to ignore you or be rude.
