I hate losing games after doing great in lane. I know the no peels and being fed scenarios are more common on low elo (like moi's) but still, I'm just trying to win games and being ahead in gold vs my opponents is not cutting it.\r\n\r\nAny tips or constructive criticism are very welcome. Thanks.","replies":[]}
