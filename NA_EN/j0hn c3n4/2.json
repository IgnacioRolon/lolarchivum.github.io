I know this is kind of a rant and I apologize to those who do not agree with my views.\r\n\r\nI've played 4,146 (2,091 Wins &amp; 2055 losses) Ranked games since the end of S3. I've been silver since I began playing and am still silver. I've hit Silver 1 a couple of times but I just tilt and I go down hard. I even went down to bronze once.\r\n\r\nI've felt so many times that I just get worse and don't even know how to get better at the game.\r\n\r\nI queue because I want to play the game but I don't even have a main role. I've tried to main roles and champions but I drop all effort once I start doing bad at it.\r\n\r\nSometimes I'll get first pick and I don't even know what role I want to play. And when I get last pick I feel super disappointed because I'm 90% sure I will get support (even though it's not always the case).\r\n\r\nThere's games that I'll do really well early and my team wont be doing so hot and then I'll get crapped on by the rest of the enemy team and feel as useless as if I had done bad in the game all along. Worst is that even though I know it's perceived as wrong - I simply hate sticking those games through (this worsens my tilt). I know teams throw all the time, but I don't feel that winning a game in those terms equates to winning and it simply does not feel satisfying. In short - I rather take the loss.\r\n\r\nI feel legitimately sad and lost. I know this may \"sound silly, it's just a video game\" but I know some of you may relate when I say it's not. Video games and League of Legends are part of my life. I go to work 5 days a week, do 9 hours there to come back home to play league from 5pm  up to midnight. Don't even get me started on weekends. But I love that I put that much time into it. Whether it's browsing the forums, reddit, watching streams (or LCS now go SKT1!).\r\n\r\nBut yeah Idk. I don't want to drop this, it's important to me. This game got me off WoW (Nothing wrong with WoW but holy cow am I grateful for League because of that). \r\n\r\nThanks for your time and I hope I don't just get down votes/useless responses.","replies":[{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2015-10-10T10:26:09.500+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I get depressed sometimes and go on tilt too, and I have a couple of ways that I have circumvented it over the years. \n\nFirst off, for the issues you mentioned in game where either you feed and lose the game or your team feeds and lose you the game, you need to remember that you wont always win but you don't always need to. If you start falling behind play much safer, lose out on cs, ward heavily, call mia's, and keep track of enemy junglers. Only take risks if you think there is less than a 255 chance of dieing. When you are ahead try to give your team kills. Just because your bot lane is 0/5, that doesn't mean that they don't deserve a second shot. Try for assists, not kills, and help them out. Typically if a teammate is around your rank and loses early, that means that they probably have a weak early game and a strong late game. You will be surprised how much having two above average gold champs helps over one really really ahead one.\n\nSecondly, for getting depressed, remember its just a game. Don't type out anything negative or really even neutral besides what are obvious jokes. Play some aram's, that always cheers me up, or watch some youtube or anime or something. Try to get someone in voice chat even if they aren't playing with you to keep yourself cheered up, you will be surprised at how much it helps, even if you aren't talking that much.\n\nYou don't have to main a lane or champ. Being a generalist in solo queue where you never know what kind of teammates you get is very strong.\n\nI hope this helps, I haven't done much ranked this season but if you want to add me i would be glad to join you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"what you deserve","date":"2015-10-10T10:12:58.837+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just main support. Not a ton of recognition for carrying, but playing a game with 30+ assists is pretty satisfying. Bonus if you're playing Taric, Lux, or Karma and manage to scale into a full on carry.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Triger","date":"2015-10-11T01:48:37.104+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"for me the best way to prevent tilt is to play with friends. make a ranked team and do 5v5. just whatever makes the game fun. if no friends are on then i go do aram. the games are short and people generally go there for fun and not for anyhting else.\n\nChin up. tomorrow is a new day","replies":[]}]}
