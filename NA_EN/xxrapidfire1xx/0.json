I went 0/7 but I still have 3 games left. If I  don't finish those games and wait till next season to do my placments with this season's losses during placments impact my rank next season even though I didn't finish them.","replies":[{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2017-07-29T08:00:19.588+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The decision to play in Ranked or not is entirely yours to make. If you don't feel like you're ready, for sure don't play Ranked.\n\nThat being said, you shouldn't worry about your Placements, really. What's important is performing **consistently** at a certain level. Even if Placements are special games and are a bit more important than normal games, they're still only 10 games. On the other hand, after the Rank reset at the beginning of each Season, people typically need 50-100 games before reaching a stable point on the ladder. Compared to 100 games, 10 Placements games are really not that important. If you go 7-3, it will be a bit faster to reach that stable point compared to if you go 3-7, but not by much.\n\nMoreover, due to how the MMR system works, when you first start playing, the system has no information on you and assumes you're just average, that you're better than 50% of players, and worse than 50% of players. That's not realistic, someone with 0 experience won't be better than 50% of all other players, who all already have some experience, but there are complicated math reasons you're forced to do it that way. So it's **totally expected and normal** to \"do bad\" in your first Placement Series ever. It's not uncommon for people to go 3-7 or 2-8 and still be placed into low Silver.\n\nAnd finally, even if you do really bad and start in Bronze, so what? Really, there is no shame in being Bronze, despite what some snobs on the Boards would make you believe. 30% of all Ranked players are in Bronze, that's almost 1 out of 3 for just one of the five tiers of Ranked. And 50% of all Ranked players are Silver4 and below. If you're just Silver 3, you're better than average ;)\n\nIn the end, if you stress out too much and don't enjoy yourself because of that, don't go in Ranked. But if you can keep a positive attitude and not worry too much about losing, I'd say that Ranked is a better environment to improve and get experience, so don't worry about your results and just go play some Ranked ;)\n\nHope that helps.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-28T22:54:25.096+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When the season resets, those placements matches will reset as well and you can start fresh from there. Your previous MMR is used slightly to calculate your new one next season, but without having placed yet it won't make too much of a difference.","replies":[]}]}
