Either way, you knew this behavior wasn't acceptable but you're still doing it under the guise that it's justified because _other people_ flamed you first. \n\n Sorry, it doesn't work that way. Mute people who give you a hard time and then report them at the end of the game.\n\n>thanks riot for perpetuating a victim culture where any one can just say someone harassed them and they get banned.\n\n Or they're trying to create an environment where nobody should flame and they're not treating you as a \"victim\" since you're guilty of the exact same thing the flamer was guilty of. \n\n Bottom line is that _you're_ responsible for _your_ behavior. If you can't control yourself when someone is giving you a hard time, you're going to get another punishment and it **will** be a permanent ban, no matter how severe you think it is.\n\n Good luck.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Prandine","date":"2019-03-28T19:16:20.053+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"First off, you're not defending yourself here, you're retaliating: there's a difference.\n\nSecond off, from [Ulanopo's Knowledge Base](http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=4086541&amp;page=5#post43468465): \n\n>**I should be allowed to speak however I like to people who started it or are griefing me.\nI was provoked or taunted.

The reason for this is rather simple: rather than one person causing trouble, you now have two  or more. In my more cynical moments, I have phrased it thus:\n\n>_Timmy, Tommy and Sarah are trapped in an elevator.\nTimmy loses his temper and soils himself.\nTommy gets angry at the smell and decides to retaliate by soiling himself.\nNow Sarah is trapped with two smelly idiots.\nDont be Timmy or Tommy. Stop ****ing your pants._\n\n>An informal poll of the Tribunal regulars shows that most jurors are willing to excuse a certain amount of response to someone who is attacking you, but that it isnt considered an excuse for you to become toxic in response. You get MAYBE one or two lines of response. Anything more than that and youre part of the problem.\n\n>From Lyte (link (http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?p=27540071#post27540071)):\n\n>_**We strongly believe that it is not OK to retaliate.** If a player refuses to cooperate and says something negative, then players should ignore the player and report them after the game.
