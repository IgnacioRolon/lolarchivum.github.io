There are so many level 1 accounts with zero games and desireable names and it seems like such a waste if none of them are gonna be used by an active player. I'm not sure when the last one was but there's one name I've been watching and wanting for a few months now so it's probably past immunity, and I'm just asking when is the next one?","replies":[{"poster":"Hollymonster","date":"2014-12-30T18:24:16.966+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"We actually don't do it in sweeps anymore.

I ended up waiting 7 months to get this name because the guy with it was lvl 2 with only a Xin game and a Jinx game. It's sad, but some players try to make money off of desirable names by grabbing them and offering to sell them, rather than actually use them to play the game","replies":[]}]}
