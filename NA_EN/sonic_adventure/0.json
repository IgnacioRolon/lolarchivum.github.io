I was Zyra support against a Swain Thresh botlane. My Draven kept shoving the lane in their turret (not the way to play this matchup), he would get hooked by either swain or thresh, and we'd both die to that and/or Xin Zhao ganks. TL;DR we were like 1/8 in 7 minutes. Draven then proceeds call me and the team all sorts of names, then disconnects and never comes back.\n\nMeanwhile our 0/5 Jayce was also having a hard time against the fed Xin and TF, but he never flamed. At that point the team's chat was basically \"aw man :( this was winnable\". Then, our Yorick tells me: _\"Zyra, farm, you're our apc now\"._\n\nWe were losing hard and had a dc'ed Draven. But Yorick or Ivern instead of blaming the team and say \"go next\" didn't say a bad word and believed the 0/5 Zyra could do something. This encouraged me a lot, and even if we'd lose, I was just looking forward to play that game with a team with that attitude.\n\nThe enemies were like \"Open? Can we just push?\" but we were on the same page mentally and no one wanted to leave. The combination of us trying our best and them perhaps being overconfident (_as every team will be when it's 20-6, 5v4 and you have 2 of their inhibs down, all drakes, and Baron_) made us stop their push.\n\nFrom that point, the game just turned really fun. Defending base, waveclearing, constant jokes. And at 36 minutes, we ended up winning after killing them at Baron. I went from 0/5 to 18/9 and the realization that this feeling is the best a game can offer. Not LP, not a border, not KDA and not your rank. If your happiness depends on your LP, you're going to tilt, be miserable, possibly toxic, and definitely climb less. _And it's always going to be hard not to do this_. I didn't gain LP yesterday, lost 3, won 1, but I didn't need to play anymore after that, and instead just felt like I had got more from League than winning 20 games.\n\nI was so happy I even forgot to report the Draven = )\n\nThanks team &lt;3\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/JX17Wv0.jpg[/img]","replies":[{"poster":"Godfather Star","date":"2019-06-16T18:26:14.233+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":12,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Sonic Adventure","date":"2019-06-16T18:32:33.514+0000","up_votes":29,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Godfather Star,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=wZIEw0vK,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2019-06-16T18:26:14.233+0000)\n>\n> a support having a 18/9 game as there best game, thats so cute &lt;3\n\nThis is not about KDA at all...

You did earn it, and I really don't want to belittle that. Don't let me!\n\nSecond: I'm guessing you're a lot younger than me with how you write; I can definitely empathize with how you feel about toxicity.\n\nHowever, I think your opinion is rooted in your age a bit. Yes. Leaving teammates and ragers who have nothing constructive to say are generally bad for win rates/team performances.\n\nBut I want to stress: A lot of players take candor WAY TOO SERIOUSLY in this game: I'm often called Toxic purely because I do point out what people are doing wrong, and usually in a blunt \"you did this\" way. I know people don't like it. But, it's often the most succinct way to say something or steer a team back to trying to win. Sure, they want to report me, but it gets them thinking, \"I AM building wrong.\" \"I am taking far too many risks.\" \"I want to prove him wrong.\"\n\nMaybe 1 in 15 of games where I get \"toxic\" does being so affect my performance. Maybe 3 in 15 does it make my teammates grief and troll because they no longer care. But, about 6 in 15 actually try harder, safer, and smarter to win.\n\nPeople really grasp on to those 4 games where performance was negatively affected by criticism though. They remember those. They don't really remember wins. Win = just another win. Loss = That guy was toxic and our loss was all his fault.\n\nIn other words, I think as time goes on, and one grows thicker skin, criticism actually does create better results. It doesn't feel good at the time, but it does win more games, as long as it's readily received.\n\nBut, we're embracing a community statute that thinks it's bad, and fosters this feeling that \"feel good\" will always create better results. I'm sure I'm not the only one who feels that way. (I do think if you're territorial, people should back off after you state that intention, but it's a good world skill to learn to take criticism. Bosses don't use positive reinforcement or a light touch when you do something wrong. Peer groups don't either. They assert their authority).\n\nYou definitely made the right call to keep playing (I never surrender and never stop trying).","replies":[{"poster":"Sonic Adventure","date":"2019-06-16T21:06:30.684+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for taking the time to write a comment,\n\nIf I seem young from writing is because I had fun as a kid this game, in a good way.

I know what wins more games and it's a good attitude.\n\nI believe you've overanalyzed my words a bit. It's pretty clear when something is toxic or constructive criticism. We suggested Jayce to build Black Cleaver and that helped. There are good and bad ways to suggest that, and it'd be silly to be against the good ones. \n\nThanks again,","replies":[{"poster":"Illabethe","date":"2019-06-17T15:05:26.668+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah. I didn't think about English secondary language :) I guess what I was looking at was the simplicity and \"purity\" of your reaction to team support in your game. English mains generally don't write in pure emotion or euphoric candor. So that totally makes sense it's not your main language.\n\nI was just saying.... generally, I don't consider positive feedback to be necessarily any more or less impactful than negative criticism, if a player is  mature. And I feel that's an important thing to say, because this community alienates people who coach or are negatively critical. If your entire team says level 1 they are going to get grievous wounds to deal with a healing team, and by 28 minutes, 0 people have grievous wounds, I find it justifiable to bring it up in a negative fashion. If a support spews the line \"I was just warding\" for the 4th time after dying by going deep to ward 4 times in a row, I find it justifiable to tell them, YOU ONLY WARD ON SAFE PATHS.\n\nYou see a lot of redundant activity in this game. People say one thing and do exactly the opposite. And more importantly, they do it repeatedly.\n\nOfc, what your Draven did wasn't criticism. What he did amounted to griefing.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2019-06-17T14:44:33.229+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean, this comment feels like it's actually trying to help, but take a few minutes to think about it.

He/She had a positive (mostly) team experience he/she wanted to revel in. My response was merely that, in the crusade to reinforce positive behavior, we often forget, to err is human, and that League is basically humanity in a 30 minute bubble.\n\nI wanted to compliment him/her on their outlook, but I always have that part of me that wants to get across this message too.\n\nShe did go 0/5 with her Draven. If he was overpushing, maybe she shouldn't have been right with him? I don't want to go in the weeds here. Draven griefed his team. Zyra played right after that. But, 0/5 in Masters is usually a loss sentence, and there IS something to learn from that score. Maybe...... don't encourage a behavior that is going to result in the adc being over aggressive? I personally wouldn't have quit the game. I certainly would have griped though, because honestly, the only reason they won was because she was Zyra. If it was a 0/5 Soraka, they likely would have lost, because Soraka doesn't have the damage/tradeability to a team that Zyra does. Zyra can dig out of holes. That doesn't mean lane should repeatedly full push early on and risk throwing away that advantage.\n\nI love the humanity in the Zyra player. I wish I could be that optimistic and positive. But, that's not me, and probably never will be me. I just find it scary this community tends to not realize personalities don't become that on a flick of a switch or even over a lifetime. Zyra says she is almost 30. I know based on scientific studies that the personality and brain are generally set on flexibility and emotional growth at 27. In other words, he/she, and I (34) probably aren't going to change our emotional predispositions much. And, I want the community to accept that. Physiologically, changing is beyond both of our controls at this stage, and there's nothing we can do about it.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"DuskDaUmbreon","date":"2019-06-17T14:31:06.215+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Congrats, man!\n\nThe 4v5 wins are always amazing.

I've played well over 5000 games since season 5 on multiple accounts and I can only recall winning like 3 or 4 4v5s and I recalling winning no 4v5 where we were behind. Those 4v5s we won, we were massively ahead before it became a 4v5.\n\nOf the many vices I have in my life, gambling was never one so you can imagine I would rather move on than stress myself on gamble that has such an extremely low chance of paying off. I absolutely hate games like the one you described and if I were in that game, it would have been 3v5 because I wasn't sticking around for that shit. It's nice that you guys won. Well done. But all it means is that you guys were supremely lucky.","replies":[{"poster":"Sonic Adventure","date":"2019-06-17T20:21:13.118+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"All I can say is that you'll never get to experience the best that League has to offer. And friendly advice, but if you're only interested in winning games, that means that you're interested in climbing, and you'll never do that giving up easily. If you have to play spend 10 more minutes playing 100 games out only to win 10 of them, that is around 160 LP net for you at the end of the season. I'm not going to develop into it more but that's one advice I'd give after reaching Master.

My team was hard feeding to the max. I'm not kidding or exaggerating when I say that every single minute of the game someone on my team was dead. At no point past like 20 minutes did we have all 5 players on our team alive at the same time. \n\nEven though I won lane hard, I asked them to surrender at 15. The rate at which they were feeding, I knew it was unwinnable. But no. They wanted to play it out. I got uber fed and tried my best to carry despite knowing for sure we would not win. And after 43 fuckin minutes, just what I knew would happen, happened. They fuckin won. I didn't feel happy or glad or anything. I'm cross that they wasted my fuckin time. These garbage ass feeders just won't stop fuckin feeding and refused to surrender. How the fuck is that shit fun?","replies":[{"poster":"Sonic Adventure","date":"2019-06-17T21:29:02.778+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't like assuming, but exaggerations like \"every single minute someone was dead\" or \"knowing for sure\" only cloud your brain. If you're that convinced that you will lose, you'll end up almost wanting to lose, just so you're right at the end. If you spend the game arguing with your team that they should ff because it's 100% lost, you're right, it's going to be a loss probably, but you're a big factor of it, like it or not.\n\nIf a game gets to 43 minutes, that basically means that the losing team was able to stop the enemies even after heavy disadvantage, so it's a big indicator for hope. At that point death timers are like over 70 seconds, any team can win and everyone is full build. It's just a matter of one teamfight.","replies":[{"poster":"FioraWillCarry","date":"2019-06-18T00:07:54.425+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Sonic Adventure,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=wZIEw0vK,comment-id=000c000000000000,timestamp=2019-06-17T21:29:02.778+0000)\n>\n> I don't like assuming, but exaggerations like \"every single minute someone was dead\" or \"knowing for sure\" only cloud your brain.\n\nDidn't I specifically say it wasn't an exaggeration? \n\nThe game was 43 minutes long, our team had 66 deaths. That's someone dying every 39 seconds. Death timers for every champion above level 12 are 40 plus seconds. At 20 minutes, it's not uncommon for multiple players on a team to be above level 12 which means, after 20 or so minutes, someone on my team was always dead.\n\nHere are the KDAs of everyone on my team:-\nMe 19-7-6\nYi 4-16\nAkali 11-16-9\nSivir 3-14-6\nMorgana 2-13-9\n\nGame length 43m 57s\n\nSo you tell me....does this look like I'm exaggerating? These fuckin pieces of shit didn't want to win. They just wanted to int. Why the fuck would anyone want to play that shit out. I'd rather just ff.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-06-17T20:51:47.879+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is this a good time to acknowledge [how much damage](https://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/3067990604/37747402?tab=stats) Zyra does?","replies":[]}]}
