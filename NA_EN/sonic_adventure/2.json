I&#039;m sure Riot would like that people got a bit more excited than just a &quot;cool.&quot; when they got a new one, since it&#039;s a whole art investment dedicated to them.\r\n\r\nHowever, I think there are a couple things that are making this task more difficult.\r\n\r\nWith the way the mission system has been working, making you have to equip an icon in order for your missions to progress, it pretty much punishes the player who wants to wear their favorite icon, or the new one they earned for being 10% most helpful. After the Yasuo/Riven event, we had an arcade one, then star guardian, then worlds and now Project event. I just played a game and 9/10 people had the default world&#039;s icon equipped. I really don&#039;t see a real benefit of creating this requisite of equipping icons. The only effect it has is removing the remaining relevance that Icons had so far. Now Snowdown might come with new missions. People simply won&#039;t have time or reason to activate their own since the one that everyone wears gives rewards.\r\n\r\nMuch less important but -&gt; Icons that give &quot;extra&quot; stuff: such as the star guardian changing the mastery emote. This is nice but it will automatically make the remaining icons more &quot;boring&quot;. The main reason why I bring this point is that the idea that the icon has a cosmetic effect in game could potentially be a way to make icons more relevant. A very simple and not developed at all concept that could work as a starting point: divide &quot;standard&quot; icons into categories like elements or something: wind, fire, water, earth, and have that choice add some according elemental particles to the mastery or emotes. Obviously I say categories because it would be too much to have each icon have their unique particles like the star guardian one.\r\n\r\nHappy thanksgiving everyone,\r\n\r\n-J","replies":[{"poster":"I am Pacman","date":"2017-11-23T19:50:02.869+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> A very simple and not developed at all concept that could work as a starting point: divide \"standard\" icons into categories like elements or something: wind, fire, water, earth, and have that choice add some according elemental particles to the mastery or emotes.\n\nThis right here is a great idea.
