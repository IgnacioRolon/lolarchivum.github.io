Give us the option to kick out from champ select a toxic player and punish him with a 30 mins queue time.","replies":[{"poster":"InsaneSamurai","date":"2015-08-23T21:58:10.032+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hilarious that someone downvoted for this.  Sadly, Riot knows about pregame trolls and doesn't care, despite it being extremely common.  You see, Riot will only actually change something if they think it's costing them money.  They don't think trolls cost them money, so they don't give a crap what we have to deal with.","replies":[]}]}
