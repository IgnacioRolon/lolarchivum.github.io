Riven's high burst and CC makes her great for peeling the ADC, as well, she can easily 2 v 1 even when not ahead with her ult.\n\nFiora's ult is absolutely terrifying with just a couple kills. It will force the enemy team to rush defensive items to deal with her.\n\nIn the Jungle, Vi{{champion:254}}, and J4 {{champion:59}} are excellent carry picks. They have % health damage in their kits and are AA based, so they will not fall off late game while being able to do damage despite building tanky. In addition, they come with a ton of mobility and CC to help snow ball their lanes. Their kits are also loaded with stats that significantly helps with clearing the jungle.\n\nUltimately, most champions in the roster can carry. However, those who are AA based (to proc on hit effects), with built in armor pen, % health damage, true damage, or magic damage on hit in their kits are the best.","replies":[{"poster":"AbrakaDoodle","date":"2015-01-14T03:14:59.872+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ty for the tips, I am now considering maining J4","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"The Fire on Fire","date":"2015-01-13T15:00:37.470+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like cheese.
