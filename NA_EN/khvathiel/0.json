For a short while now I've been trying to figure out how it is that Riot has come up with the names of their factions/species/characters in Runeterra. While searching, I discovered a reddit post (from about five years ago as of writing this) from a user named RiotJeffJew that states that the word \"Yordle\" comes from a dream that a dev named Pabro had, in which he woke up yelling the word.\r\n\r\nHowever, outside of this, I have not been able to find any other leads as to how the Dev teams came up with names such as Vastaya/Vastayashai’rei or what they looked at for inspiration. I myself would have guessed mythology or within history, such as how Pantheon is, in a sense, a Hoplite (A Greek light soldier which fought with spears and shields).\r\n\r\nI'd love to know more about this as I enjoy coming up with species and world names, even if I sometimes struggle heavily with inspiration.

Things like. “Easy to say and comedic sounding.”\n\nThen do a little bit of research — often names from 3 or more real world regions.  Finding/looking for similarities and linguist conventions.  \n\nThen make a long list of names.  Generally, a list of 100 names.   Then do a google search and google image search for every single name. And cull names that are real world stuff.  (Unless one of the goals is for the character to have a normal or real world name.)\n\nNow that big list is probably only 12 to 20 names—because across a dozen or more languages -somebody  has used that combo of letters before. \n\nNow send that small list with the goals for the name to our localization team.  Who can tell you if the name “sounds” like something it shouldn't.   Now unless your unlucky you’ve got 6 or so names to show the team.\n\nThen you and the team pick one.\nThen it goes to IP leads and sometimes legal. \n\nI remember vastaya was meant to sound old, elven and lyrical.

Definitely more involved than what I originally thought happened, which was sitting around for a few hours or days trying to come up with a name that sounds cool, which is a bit naive in hindsight.  As for Legal, I assume it means making sure the name/word isn't one that's copyrighted to another franchise, like how a certain publisher copyrighted the word scrolls, huh? \n\nI do wonder if the original/retired devs did something similar to what you guys do right now.  And if maybe one day they'll share their stories about it, assuming they're not under an NDA since according to a friend of mine, a lot of devs are prohibited to talk about the process which sorta made sense but also felt far fetched. I am hopeful because for a lot of games, their development lore seems to just vanish and never be talked about outside of the people who made the games, which is a bit sad to me because I genuinely like to know how the games I love were built and put together. (Unless I am sorely mistaken and just don't know where to look, which I probably am tbh.)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"mrmeddyman","date":"2019-09-13T16:54:06.765+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Well the region names were made before the team really cared for lore which is why a lot of them are actually kind of generic (not in terrible way, just kind of obvious)\n\nDemacia - Democracy, which is a bit silly since Demacia has always been a monarchy afaik, but it more reflects their one-sided good nature\n\nNoxus - Noxious, Noxians were super evil (except {{champion:55}} ) and they ate babies, if you look at the old now non-canon Noxus city art, it's actually hilarious how unironically evil the city looks. \n\nPiltover - The -Over part is supposed to sound British I guess, bringing to mind a sort of Victorian Industrial Revolution to mind since that's what it's based on\n\nZaun -\n \nShurima -  Sounds arab because of the I-consonat-a at the end.

Therefore, Ionia = Asia, even though the actual people of real-world Ionia would either be equated as Targonian or Shuriman, or maybe even as Noxian or Demacian in actual Runeterra.\n\nAlso, Noxus might have been named as such to refer to \"Nox\", the nominative for \"night\" in Latin, because night is dark and dark equates to the old, pure evil Noxus. But the noxious meaning makes more sense for people of Noxus being called \"Noxians\" instead of \"Noxans\".

The Ionic column style also comes from there, in-between the plain Doric and elegant Corinthian styles, which is what a lot of people tend to know about real-world Ionia by default.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"KHVathiel","date":"2019-09-14T06:29:09.373+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=EdgeLady,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=bxAP9gYZ,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2019-09-13T20:04:38.020+0000)\n>\n> Actually, Ionia is the old name for a part of the western Turkish coast, and in the Classical period (particularly in the earlier days of Ancient Greece, before trade between other, farther-eastern places like India and China became more plausible), Turkey, then called Anatolia, was usually considered as Asia in general and it's the reason why it's still sometimes called \"Asia Minor\" today.\n\nThis is actually pretty interesting :o Thanks!
