Like a lot of people we preferred the pink rather than the red that was implemented. I feel like there should be an option when you're going to purchase Blood Moon Elise to be able to choose if you'd like pink or red Elise. So that way people who like a certain version of Elise can be happy and as well more sales for Riot since I've seen some people not wanting to buy the new Elise because of how much the red clashed with the blue and gold (myself being included). Maybe this is asking for too much, but just wanted some feedback :) Sorry if I'm posting in the wrong category, I had no idea where to put this.","replies":[{"poster":"PlGRULER","date":"2015-01-03T22:42:51.813+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I loved how the pink Elise looked, it's a shame they took her off. I hope they will give you the option of buying either or!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sukishoo","date":"2015-01-03T22:57:30.582+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"final color was a magenta though, that's not pink or red xD\n\nReally though, how would it work? the splash is already one color, then in-game you'd see another? that'd be odd...but like it was said, they won't be doing anything like this.","replies":[{"poster":"IiIiana","date":"2015-01-03T23:08:23.886+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"The final version was kind of an ombre, with a magenta skirt, cherry top and a very very red head piece.  I understand what they tried to do, but it looks really off with the blue (and the golden legs too)\n\nI really liked the pink version better and an option to choose between red and pink would be amazing.\nAlso, about the splash, I don't think it's a problem because it is so dark that you can't tell what color it is. It looks cherry-purpleish under the blue light of her claws. (by the way, color isn't a problem. Headhunter nidalee has green hair in the splash but in game it's just black and grey)","replies":[{"poster":"cshakes","date":"2015-01-04T12:51:21.460+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly, they should've just kept the pink and called it Masquerade Elise or something. If they wanted to make a proper Blood Moon Elise, the gold-blue spider legs etc should've been recolored to fit the Blood Moon red-black-white color scheme (maybe white with red tips).","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"AquariusGine","date":"2015-01-03T22:52:20.572+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"they already said they wont be implementing this, (RiotKateyKhaos)","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-01-06T21:23:05.600+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=AquariusGine,realm=EUW,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=gE2JwxWZ,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-01-03T22:52:20.572+0000)\n>\n> they already said they wont be implementing this, (RiotKateyKhaos)\n\nUnfortunately, for this skin, it's not something that will be implemented. \n\nHowever, it's something to look into!","replies":[{"poster":"IiIiana","date":"2015-01-07T19:14:28.173+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Does that mean there is no hope on getting elise back to pink?
