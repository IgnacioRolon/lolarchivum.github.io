It then restarted my desktop and I have now been banned because of the league servers disconnecting me from the game because of Ivern being released. Is this normal? Is there anything I can do to get rid of the wait in queues?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-06T20:31:03.789+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds really strange that a crash would cause a restart to your PC.  Usually, a shut down could signify a major hardware issue.  Can you elaborate on what you mean when you say crash?  Were there any errors, and what did you see exactly?  I'd like to help get this fixed up to prevent it in the future!","replies":[{"poster":"veigarbage can","date":"2016-10-08T18:34:17.761+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, I got a LeaverBuster, with a similar situation, in the Ivern patch: I was getting rid of my LeaverBuster because my internet went out when I was playing Malphite, and during the time I was trying to get rid of it, my game crashed in Ranked. Turns out I got corrupted files during a patch, and my team remade, resetting my LeaverBuster. I'm not blaming my team, they had the right, but I wish I could tell them what happened before they remade. There might be something wrong with the patch, I honestly don't know.","replies":[]}]}]}
