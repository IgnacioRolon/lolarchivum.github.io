I was **PulseFire Ezreal** and he was FireCracker Jinx. Once I got level 6 I did the normal animation and then that was the time things went crazy.\r\n\r\nPulseFire Ezreal was starting to move really fast, although my movement speed wasn't gaining, so what im trying to say is that i had an animation as if i was moving really fast, although he wasn't. And not only that, I was also a white block on the map, and when i died to turret, it said a turret got excuted by a turret.\r\n \r\nPBE: Bot Ezreal Bot\r\n \r\nLOL: CakeCaik","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-03-23T16:49:23.041+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey CakeCaik! \n\nThanks for the report! \n\nThis a known issue and as you've mentioned, is a visual bug! \n\nIn the future, please report PBE-related bugs on the [PBE boards](http://boards.pbe.leagueoflegends.com/en/).
