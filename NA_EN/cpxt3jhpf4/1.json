That said, it's all buffers. There're no cancels, and with no instant-cast abilities the only simultaneous cast is WE.

With WE,  the E doesn't start casting until just before the W cast completes, so they land at the same time. Every other combo has to be sequential, so while most things buffer really well, it's critical to know exactly what you're doing in what order. Only one it makes _significantly_ easier is QE, since it lets you move your mouse around after targeting E but before it casts. The advantage from that is pretty minimal, though.

For teamfights where you're not the primary engage, E is actually incredibly important, especially if you don't want to buy Protobelt. It can really be a problem to get past CC to position for ult otherwise, even with flash up, since she's fairly squish and very immobile. For pushing, _both_ are important - E for CC, and passive because have you seen how much damage a full-AP Morgana's W does to a minion wave? That said, passive is def. out of place overall.\n\nWhat fits totally depends on her rework theming. Focus on the \"freedom from kayle's tyranny\" side of things and the E, and you could get a powerful anti-CC support - drop her R for something reflecting Kayle's (maybe something similar to a Locket active with a very brief spellshield attached?), give her a movespeed passive of some sort, and then make her W less about zone control and more about consistent %missing health damage.\n\n Focus on her amazing CC/teamfight, and you could drop her E for an engage tool (dash?) and attach a brief self-spellshield to it. Passive would probably be something combo-ish - extended CC on the next spell if you can do something mildly difficult and inconsistent? \n\nFocus on the \"Fallen Angel\" darkness/corruption/damage side of things, and you could drop her Q and R's CC duration, but extend it while the target is in her W. Either put some sort of %current/%missing health DoT in her passive OR attached the CC duration extension to her passive. Drop the E entirely and either replace it with some sort of debuff or with a Grounding effect of some sort.\n\nObviously none of this is balanced in the least, and some of it is ridiculously broken or blatantly terrible, but we're talking theming and what would \"fit\". Most of these I'd actually kinda dislike in key ways, though. It'll be interesting to see how they go about updating her. I doubt they'll break her for me, since most of my favorite things about her are pretty core, but we'll see!\n\nWhat I really do hope is that they flesh out her character thoroughly, make her vastly more interesting (and hopefully less edgy T.T), and give her some decent voice lines.

Maybe even swap away from it. Riot doesn't seem to like full invulnerability very much, and if they shift Kayle away from the Support role they apparently originally thought she'd be in, there's less of a point to it.\n\nAs for Morg, I do like the idea for the retribution shield. Sorta goes away from the \"freedom\" anti-CC stuff and more to a \"revenge\" theme, but that works well. I really dislike your ulti change, though. A huge part of her ult is positioning to maximize the number of enemies hit. Having a 3s channel where you're rewarded for having everyone _right_ next to you as an _incredibly_ squishy, immobile mage seems like an unintuitive mechanic that'd either make her ult fairly useless (since her ult is already an extremely long stun, you'd have to lower the CC duration further away rather than raise it nearby) or make her build tank (which is so much worse).\n\nIn fact, your Morg rework in general looks _super_ tanky. Flat passive HP regen based on minions killed, damage reflection, and an ult that wants you immediately adjacent to your targets for an extended period of time. In fact Morg's Q already rewards you for staying close to your target (seriously, that projectile is slow), and her W is best if you can force them to stand in it if they want to fight her - less need to chain your Q-R combo to get the full W duration that way. This'd shut down any hope she'd have of being a mid mage. In fact, I'm pretty sure that rework would make her a top-lane split push/teamfight tank, similar to Shen. After all, her shove at level 5+ is already pretty amazing. She can pretty much put a W on the caster minions and walk away, and the lane will autopush (in fact, that's the standard backing strategy for me when I take her TT bot - force/wait for the foe to back, W the casters, Q any cannons (or lacking that, a melee) for the extra gold, then b. It bounces by the time you're back. Doesn't work if they're pushed past the middle of lane towards you until you have first item, but after that you can bounce or autopush any empty lane whenever you want.\n\nDon't take this the wrong way, mind - I like some of the ideas and themes in general.

Outside of Morello's in mid, she hardly even builds mana atm. Occasionally she'll go through RoA metas, but the big mana items rarely synergize with her kit at all. She's not a spammer at _all_, so building Tear on her outside of ARAMs is a total waste. Why would she have mana scaling?\n\nOn the ult: I guess, but that vastly decreases her control of the battlefield. Forcing people to run away from her and having such a large area they have to leave is a big part of dictating the flow of teamfights. I guess it's less that I'm directly opposed to this one so much as I don't understand _why_.\n\n\n> As for Kayle, the idea for her ult was to make it have a much bigger CD but, if timed correctly, she is rewarded for it, instead of having it up every 45 second when she is lvl 16 with 40% cdr.\n\nWell, just making her E - or her range at least - built-in would go a long way towards this. Without needing to rush 100% uptime on E, she doesn't have much reason to build CDR. That said, not needing CDR could just turn her into an ADC, since she wouldn't necessarily have to rush Nashor's and could end up going BotRK first. Guess it depends a lot on implementation. I'm not exactly a Kayle expert.

Her passive (in my opinion) is just an ability that's rarely appreciated for the sustain it provides but that might be good for a mid Morgana (the one role she really isn't being played in a lot anymore) and it is an absolutely useless ability for the bot lane.\n\nI'm split on her ult, to be honest.\nFor one, her Q is such a long range ability that i can't think of a reason why would a squishy Morgana want to be in the middle of the enemy team in order to maximize its usage.\nAt least, the usage should make her a bit more durable in some aspects, rather than requiring an actual Item to be a decent and somewhat safe ability to use. I play her like a long range mage anyway so her ult is just a wasted ability on me. I'd rather not simply go into the enemy team as i'm not Karthus.\n\nWhat feels even worse is that if you buy Zhonya's, your ult usage is tied to Zhonya's CD of 120 seconds in order to use it effectively. Your actual R CD is irrelevant, if you need to initiate a teamfight. The only way i use my R without a Zhonya's is when i'm trying to scout for invisible enemies (your ult reveals them and becomes available only when they are in range) or when my ally is already under fire and i'm trying to buy time or force the enemy to back off from them.\n\nHer W is a good waveclear tool and essential to her mid lane but if you're playing her as a support, that ability is just being used to proc TD or generate easy gold from FCQ. That's it. It's a waste of mana. Even for her mid lane, that's just a waveclear tool and without her Q hitting the enemy, there's just no way anyone's going to stand in it willingly. I'm completely for reworking this ability or replacing it for something better and much more satisfying to use.\n\nAll in all, Morgana might still be a super scaling AP mage but her abilities all require Q to hit. An enemy who is very mobile and the one who outranges you is going to be a real problem. Her Black Shield is an ability that's useless when facing an AD assassin like Zed and Talon. She has too many weaknesses that the enemy can exploit to counter her. Even countering her slightly makes her entire kit unreliable.\n---\n\n#TL;DR\n\nThe abilities i think make Morgana... well, Morgana are Q and E. This is the core of her kit.\nPassive and W can be changed. The ult depends on these two abilities first. Giving her incentive or statuses for going into melee is a must, not buying a Zhonya's. If this doesn't happen, just rework it as well.\n\n\n\nEven if i'm a Morgana main, it doesn't mean that every Morgana main would agree with me. Everyone has something they'd like to remove or keep. But in any case, i've never really given her eventual rework much thought, in terms of what exactly i'd like to see from it. _**But most definitely i'd like for her to be an antithesis to Kayle and that even her kits would reflect their lore, personalities and convictions.**_ I most definitely like Morgana's \"cather\" side and i would like her to remain a burst combo mage.\n\n_Sincerely, a Morgana main._","replies":[{"poster":"RocketRelm","date":"2017-06-19T06:17:49.265+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"One Morgana Main to another, I understand a lot of what you're saying, and it makes sense.

Don't get me wrong, it's loads of fun, and gives her a ton of playmaking potential but it puts her early-game in a position of building for teamfights or damage, but not both. It synergizes well with her Q for a single target, and with her E if the foes are all about magic damage, but it's otherwise just a really strange ability in an otherwise super ranged-oriented kit.
