I might not always be found of the voices they give them when they rework or remake some champions but some of the stories are very well made like the Katarina one. Gives us a sequel to what happened after she almost failed her mission that left her the scar on her eye. I like how it shows that she has become her own person in a cool way and that she instead of fighting for her father she fights for noxus. \r\n\r\nAlso add i really like the Annie story. Makes me like Annie a little more and gets me thinking past her kit and to the champion herself. Very cool story","replies":[{"poster":"SnÃ rky","date":"2019-02-06T04:18:35.529+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Was hoping it was going to involve her and Garen but a good insight into her personality none the less.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Whyte Lyon","date":"2019-02-06T05:59:10.192+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As I think about it, Katarina's personal conflict is pretty much repackaged Akali's. \n\nThe falling out with the mentor or if you wanna take it so far the 'daddy' issues are the same for both characters and you said so yourself _\"she has become her own person that instead of fighting for her father she fights for noxus.\"_ Swap out Noxus in that phrase, replace it with Ionia and you'd be talking about Akali.","replies":[{"poster":"GreenLore","date":"2019-02-07T11:29:13.823+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is however a key difference here and that is the fact that Katarina is on pretty bad terms with her father,wheras Akali could likely return to the Kinkou whenever she wanted.","replies":[{"poster":"Whyte Lyon","date":"2019-02-07T11:53:39.700+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The possibility of returning to the mentor, or any future events that could occur is not the point.

However, I don't think Akali is fighting for Ionia, per se. To me, her story is more her redefining what \"balance\" means to her - taking the morality and duty she's been tasked with since childhood and filtering it through her own growing and expanding interpretation. \n\nWhere she, Shen, Zed, and other Ionia champs end up will be really fun to explore going forward!","replies":[{"poster":"Gear5Luffy","date":"2019-02-07T22:41:42.744+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"What about Jhin will his personality ever reach that pinnacle of completion or will he forever be looking for perfection till he dies/gets caught\n{{champion:202}} {{champion:202}} {{champion:202}} {{champion:202}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Et Tu Geddn XNa ","date":"2019-02-06T13:39:20.741+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like the way they did it with Katarina more though.

I dont know if Riot meant for this, or they forgot about Zyra when Ivern was released and then forgot about Ivern when reapproach Zyra lore. However, out of the plant trinity, Zyra and Ivern mirrored each other quite nicely.\n\nLore wise, they are both the result of human hubris, but while Ivern the Terrible INTENTIONALLY fell the God-Willow, the unnamed sorceress had never meant to harm the Garden of Zyr, the destruction come purely from a magical spark. Before that fateful moment, the Freljordian warlord had gone through great length to intentionally seek the land of magic, while as far as we know the unfortunate woman never aimed for the primal force that lies in the forest, and her qualm with the Garden was purely self-preservation.\n\nFunnily enough, their bodies are being used by magical nature in a similar 'recycling' kind of way. Ivern (the human) was guided by the very tree he meant to kill (the nature) to become the one we know today, yet the sorceress (the human) body was most likely the template for whatever left of the Garden (the nature) to become Zyra.\n\nContinue with the mirror comparison, Ivern and Zyra is the two sides of natures made in humanoid form and psyche. Ivern is the equilibrium state of nature, and the acceptance of humanity as part of a greater whole, as well as its respect toward natural force. Zyra, on the other hand, hates humanity without ever realizing that she is fueled by the same will and passion that encourage the other side to push back.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Et Tu Geddn XNa ","date":"2019-02-06T16:51:53.927+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That there will be similarities in the stories i dont doubt but that there are ways they make each of them unique is whats fun despite them having \"daddy\" issues","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
