But there is someone who got that nickname first, but that persons not playing for over 1 year. I checked LoL namecheck, and it says that it would be cleaned up in April 24th. I want to shorten the clean up date. I heard that one of my friends got a nickname by that so Riot can you help me?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-27T17:23:46.745+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Summoners names are protected by the [summoner name clean up](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751914-Summoner-Name-Clean-Up-), so they can't be released until enough time has passed.  Third party sites that show a player's activity may not be accurate, and aren't able to provide specific dates for names.  Your best bet is to keep an eye out and try again on occasion.  Best of luck!","replies":[]}]}
