Either way too late, thanks for the info\n\nThere's a difference and a fine line between trash talking and pointless raging/flaming though, and we have to be careful not to cross that line too much if at all. Also, even though you say most of what you said in your reform card was directed at your friend you have to remember that you two aren't the only people in the game or on your team and as such what you two find as light-hearted banter others may find as needless rage and flame. Just try to be mindful of other people in the future when bantering with each other in a way that might come off as rude and disrespectful, or at the very least keep it in private chat so you don't run this risk again.","replies":[{"poster":"The Clean One","date":"2018-02-14T18:11:54.037+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"eh thanks for the insight but there is no future I am permabanned lol","replies":[{"poster":"Prandine","date":"2018-02-14T21:19:01.267+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=The Clean One,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=besVLY1A,comment-id=00000000000000000001000000000000,timestamp=2018-02-14T18:11:54.037+0000)\n>\n> eh thanks for the insight but there is no future I am permabanned lol\n\nYou could always make a new account and prove on that one that you've improved your behavior, but if you do then expect it to eventually meet the same fate as your old one did should you continue with the same behavior that got it permabanned.

Its more of the game fault which they refuse to admit and as a result players suffer. They wave the toxic flag and wrap themselves as some patron saints to clean up society as excuse to push their agenda. But refuse to accept if they dont fuck with million changes in game every year the game would not be in this state. The change in rune sytems over and over, Old player cant even come back to this shit. Why do you have million changes a year to keep balancing every champ with endless cycle.
