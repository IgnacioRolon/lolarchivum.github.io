Most of the reasoning behind why I've been punished before is solid and deserving. Toxicity has only become such a large issue recently with the ever-growing popularity of League, which means more frustrations with new players/already toxic players joining. I can't offer any solution as to how to deal with toxicity, so please no future comments of \"well what do YOU think Riot should do?\" What I'm here to address is my own personal experiences as a toxic player and against toxic players.\r\n\r\nI've played this game since around the end of season 1 and have enjoyed it ever since. I started this game with no anger issues at all, in real life or on video games. For along time, I was a fun and helpful player (I still can be, but with the majority of the community today I think the fun has run its course). It wasn't until the beginning of this season that my anger towards this game started to plant itself. For some reason unbeknownst to anyone, many players grew toxic. This rubbed off on me the wrong way, and I started getting agitated with people who would intentionally feed, flame, etc. I never did (and still don't) get angry with new players or people who just mess up, but the more I hammered out some soloq and the longer I played this game, the more I realized people are just... jerks. They'll yell at you for failing to camp their lane and win the game for them. They'll completely blow up if you take \"their\" blue buff (even as mid, yes) and talk you down if you miss a team fight. What most people DON'T realize, though, are the silent toxic players.\r\n\r\nYes, it's easy to track down and ban toxic players with the new Tribunal system, but that's ONLY if they talk. The most persistent lingering threat that I've seen in games (the ones that actually brought out my toxicity) are the ones that feed, or intentionally play worse for x or y reason. It turned me, and I'm sure many others, into the toxic people they became, but while I have mostly recovered from this \"disease\", it still plagues me sometimes. I still have uncalled for outbursts at people intentionally throwing a game, and while I do know this generally makes it worse it's a hard habit to kill when fixated on justice and putting someone in their place. Anger only begets more anger, but while verbal toxicity is very, very bad, I do not think it should always be BANNED.\r\n\r\nI've been handed out 3 temporary suspensions now, all 3 based off of a single game where, yes, I was pretty toxic. Here's the kicker: being suspended did not ease the toxicity at all. In fact, I don't think suspension normally helps players, _especially_ the verbally toxic ones. Here's an idea... instead of chat restrictions, remove their ability to chat ENTIRELY. Riot has said it themselves that most victories have very little or no verbal communication. Or at least give us a way to turn off chat, and not just all chat. I mean the ability to chat with teammates as well.  Even without this solution, though, I've found that, personally, chat restrictions have done a LOT better for me than a 2-week suspension. I've never been the type of person that feeds or afk's when flustered, and I know that there are other players out there like that.\r\n\r\nIn short, banning doesn't always (or even normally) fix the problem. You're going to get that player back or on an alt account, unchanged. We need some way to detect and get rid of those that silently feed or afk (but stay there as not to detect leaverbuster). THOSE are the real threat to the community. For anybody that read this, thank you for your time and input as well if you leave a comment below.","replies":[{"poster":"Purodyuusaa","date":"2015-08-09T05:12:11.050+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Somehow or another, League of Legends develops a \"me vs them\" mentality amongst its players.  \nI play lots of different games that require team work in order to succeed.

They already know what to do, how to do and how to handle it if it fails. \nWith League however, everything needs to be learned on the spot while playing. This brings about a lot mistakes on the player's part and by extension flaming from others because instead of trying to help a player improve, League players find it easier to tell people to go and suck dicks as that's all they're good for(this happened to me).\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cheeseyoger","date":"2015-08-09T14:44:52.477+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Purodyuusaa,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=LY5EUETn,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-08-09T05:12:11.050+0000)\n>\n> Somehow or another, League of Legends develops a \"me vs them\" mentality amongst its players.  \n> I play lots of different games that require team work in order to succeed.

Not to say that Riot has messed up, but I think the situations in league are different from what you're talking about in a way that increases the chances of toxic reactions.\n\n Back when I first started playing league, I played almost exclusively bots matches because I just enjoyed it more. I liked working as a team against an AI more than against another team of players. I wasn't a huge fan of trying to make someone else lose just so I could win. That's changed more as I've watched various LCS splits and played more competitive games out of league with better sportsmanship environments. Now I appreciate the competitive spirit of two opposing teams going at it with everything they have out of respect for themselves and each other. Anywho, I think the pvp nature might be adding to it. \n\nAdditionally, league matches have at most 10 people talking to each other, usually a lot less. In most games I've noticed with really bad toxicity, half or more of the people in game are never heard from in chat. Which makes things  a bit more in your face than with a big raiding party, where there's usually a lot of chatting going on between different people. If anything, the side chatter usually just makes it hard to hear what you're trying to listen to. But if someone gets toxic, it also drowns them out more. In league, toxic chat grabs your attention immediately, especially if you're watching chat for actual important team communications to come in. And unless people start actively talking about the toxicity, which goes badly more often than well it seems, the toxic comments stay there in chat. They don't get flushed out by everyone else chatting about other things. \n\nAnd then the last thought I have is that league is a stressful game. It's decided by seconds. And you can really feel it at times. In lane if your opponent could kill you, you try really hard not to get caught while trying to get xp and gold from minions. When their jungler hasn't been seen in a while or some lanes go missing, you get really focused on watching the map vision patches to see if they come for you or someone else. When your teams are dancing for a team fight, you're watching their shifting positions, your position shifting, your teammates' positions shifting, watching if anyone starts an animation for a skill shot, judging ranges between each of your key cc and damage targets and each of their key targets. There's a tremendous amount to track sometimes, and while you're doing this you usually still have to farm or clear waves before they can siege with one, lay wards to watch your team's flanks, all kinds of little but important tasks. It's stressful, it really really is. So if that stress isn't addressed healthily, which I don't think anywhere in league really helps you learn to do, it can easily be vented off at your team or the other team. Especially if you feel like someone on your team has screwed up your chances of succeeding in those highly stressful, highly competitive moments by feeding someone, not warding properly, not farming well, not taking or protecting a tower earlier, taking a buff that would have helped you, etc.\n\nIn raids, people can still mess up mechanics and get the group wiped because of it, and it's frustrating if that happens more than once in a row, but there's usually more time between those wipes than in league where you could team fight every couple minutes some games. So the frustration stacks quicker, and each previous blunder feeds into the next, making it harder and harder to recover. \n\nTLDR; \nPvP breeds competitive feelings that can be misdirected, chat from individual players is usually more in your face in league than in a raid group, and league is a high-speed, high-stress game where each previous mistake can make it harder to compete in the present and future of the match, rapidly stacking up frustrations with yourself and your team.\n\nJust my thoughts on where some of this might be coming from.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Wade Funk","date":"2015-08-09T08:33:54.893+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its just the nature of the game. People aren't toxic.. the game itself breeds toxicity, just as any other MOBA. And the sooner Riot realizes this (which I don't think they will) the sooner they can start taking real steps towards decreasing the toxicity of the game. As an example, replacing a leaver or afker with a bot as heroes of the storm does would no doubt alleviate some of the stress caused by leavers. I think there also needs to be more harsher punishment towards people who queue up for ranked games with no intention of actually trying.. that can be tricky though.\n\nAs far as I'm aware MOBA's are the only genre of multiplayer game in which someone messing up on your team or doing poorly can cause you so much stress. Like when you're trying your best and winning against your lane opponent but all of your effort is fully negated by the fact that your bot lane is feeding relentlessly. The person you won against ends up getting in on the feedfest and that person then comes back and destroys you, spamming laughing emotes the whole way to your nexus. All because of that guy in Bot lane who \"is just having fun.\" Expecting people to not get frustrated by those sorts of circumstances is very unrealistic IMO. You would have to be a special kind of person to not let that bother you. Perhaps you are a Saint.\n\nBut alas, Lyte and crew continue their campaign of purging \"Toxic Players\" who are nothing more than a victim to the design of the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jubbinaut","date":"2015-08-09T23:22:00.267+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Unreal Reality,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=LY5EUETn,comment-id=,timestamp=2015-08-09T04:15:09.416+0000)\n>\n> We need some way to detect and get rid of those that silently feed or afk (but stay there as not to detect leaverbuster). THOSE are the real threat to the community. For anybody that read this, thank you for your time and input as well if you leave a comment below.\n\nSometime *very* soon, they should be implementing a system that's been in development for some time that will detect and address feeders **much** faster than the current systems do. It's important to remember, though, that Riot hasn't been ignoring the problem - it's simply been difficult to address quickly.\n\nAdditionally, I feel I should note that afk's are detected by Leaverbuster even if they remain connected to the game. I don't know how it detects them - and I sincerely doubt Riot will tell anyone - but I know that at least one metric it measures by is experience gain. In short, if you aren't doing anything meaningful, Leaverbuster will take notice, regardless of whether or not you are connected to the game.\n\nThat said, I want to address a misconception you seem to have.\n\n> I've been handed out 3 temporary suspensions now, all 3 based off of a single game where, yes, I was pretty toxic.\n\nUnless you were spewing hate speech or death threats, your bans are **extremely** unlikely to have been due to a single game.

I don't believe what Anne Frank said about humanity. I don't believe that truly toxic people can be rehabilitated by anyone other than themselves. Or more likely, not at all.

Also, I get a sick pleasure out of seeing people crying about getting banned =/\n\nWas going to downvote, but actually read the whole thing and changed my mind. You make very good points. But, when you're toxic because other toxic people rub off on you, you're just as bad as they are. Stupid assholes never have that kind of self-awareness, and the fact that you recognize your flaws puts you in a different class. Rise above that shit. Find creative ways to channel your anger. As cliche as it sounds, it really is just a game. I'm not saying don't be mad, I'm saying don't take it out on other people.\n\nHere's one: Next time you're mad, sing \"Let it Go\".

That player is going to come back, either after the suspension or on an alt account, and they'll be just as bad as before. The solution can't always simply be \"let's ban them again\". People have a tendency to return to the largest moba available. As for people getting theirs when the time comes, I don't really believe that at all. That's some fantasy that every person who does something bad gets punished, which is very false. The justice system in any game or government is not flawless, so there will be those that slip through. My point was that it bothers me that the worst of the flock plague this game and get away with it more often. You can quell a verbally toxic player by removing their ability to chat. If they become an afker/feeder, chances are they were already doing that. But how do you stop someone who trolls or intentionally feeds? Many are \"intelligent\" enough to leave no trace in chat and it can be pawned off as \"just a bad game\". Then it takes much, much longer to get rid of these people.\n\nRising above it is a very noble notion, one I would very much like to do, but alas things are easier said than done. Don't misinterpret that as me giving up, though. I've been doing my best, but it's a process when it's this deep seeded already. I honestly do think shutting off my chat entirely would help a lot if they had that option. When the temptation isn't there, it removes a lot of the reason to be angry.

The trolls aren't banned. just people who want to win but is being dragged down with frustration because you're doing what you can and only seem to be getting fucked over. \n\nIt's just unfair, in my opinion.

I'm right there with you, i would rather disable my chat before i start playing rather than just being banned, and it seems really stupid that's not an option. \n\nYou can communicate fine in pings, but once someone really starts working my gears in game i can't laugh it off every. single. fucking. time.
