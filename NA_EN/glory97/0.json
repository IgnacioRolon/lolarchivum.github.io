Yeah the game might not be going well for you, but just quitting is the worst thing you can do. It completly ruins the game for everyone else. Even when the team is toxic, you have the mute button. In my opinion people who ragequit should be punished extremly hard, in extrem cases even permabanned.\r\n\r\nHow can riot distinguish ragequit from dc?\r\nAn algorithm could probably do this job. Ragequits pretty much never happen when the player in question is doing great in the game.\r\nWe just have to look at the kda, gold and lvl in comparison to the opposing player of the given role, at the point where a player is disconnecting. Maybe the overall gold/objectives of both teams should also be reviewed.

Except for super high elo, pretty much every game is a fiesta anyways. And the team that gets ahead often plays extremly greedy. And the loosing team plays correctly they definetly have a chance to come back. But the biggest obstacle in the way of making a comback are players like you, that just give up after 5 minutes. These players are not even trying and that one player that refuses to even try winning that game (wether he disconnects or just stays to troll) are the thing that makes a game where you are behind unwinnable.","replies":[{"poster":"FioraWillCarry","date":"2020-01-09T08:40:51.340+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Glory97,realm=EUW,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=5AdqKcvF,comment-id=00060000,timestamp=2020-01-08T21:30:50.386+0000)\n>\n> Well I completly disagree with you.

And the loosing team plays correctly they definetly have a chance to come back.\n\nOk, this is complete and utter bullshit to the point that a statement like this should be considered trolling.\n\nLet me explain something. I'm willing to wager that the majority of players above Iron have been playing League since season 5 and earlier. Do you remember what the game was like in season 5? I do. There was no Rift Herald, The dragon was a shitty little thing that gave practically no useful stats and taking it was more about bragging rights than an actual win condition. Minions didn't scale. Statik Shiv didn't have a damage penalty vs minions. HP items gave a lot more HP. AP champions' damage to towers didn't scale with their AP and champions generally did a lot less damage to towers. There was no mechanic like the demolish rune. The inhibitor towers and the Nexus towers had a laser with a massive slow. The jungle gave much more XP to the point where power farmers could actually out-level solo laners consistently.\n\nSo what does all this mean? It means that a team going 5-20 by 15 minutes didn't mean the game was over. There were so many options to stall games out to the point that people could actually start coming back. You could power farm the jungle, you could employ items like Statik Shiv to effectively stall sieges and much more. Surrendering as soon as the early game goes to shit in season 5 was fuckin trolling because there were so many things you could do to stall and there was very little the team that's ahead could do to roll over you with that lead. If they wanted to roll over you after getting a lead, they actually had to have skill. You didn't just use your massive lead to bulldoze 3 towers in 30 seconds with demolish and Rift Herald. You couldn't just bully the losing team out of all the dragons and use it's powerful stats to just run over them.\n\nNever surrendering made sense in that time but the game has changed and humans are very slow to change old habits. This is a human thing. We are resistant to change our approach to things when it has proven successful in the past. This is why this \"never ff\" attitude prevails today. It was born in a time where it was actually relevant. But older players like us need to accept the reality that this doesn't work anymore. If a game is 5-20 by 15 minutes in the current meta, this game is over. You do not come back from a deficit like that in Season 9 and most likely for the foreseeable future. \n\nThere is good news though. Players are catching on. It's very very slow going but I have noticed that a lot more players than before are beginning to understand this new fast paced meta. I see a lot more early surrenders these days, far more than I've seen in the past year. So there's hope for you guys.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Yin Yang Taoist","date":"2020-01-07T06:46:16.915+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Glory97,realm=EUW,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=5AdqKcvF,comment-id=,timestamp=2020-01-06T21:27:20.084+0000)\n\n> \n> How can riot distinguish ragequit from dc?\n> An algorithm could probably do this job.

What you said only works for people with bad internet on a regular basis. It doesn't work for everyone. And I don't know if Riot would be willing to spend resources on someone _sleuthing_ over to see if this guy's been d/c'ing in bad games _only_. Or bad games and good games, _regardless_. I honestly have no idea on whether they actually do check this or not. But I am going to say that they probably don't because it requires a lot of magnification into the issue. \n\nFor example, if Player X d/c'd in 30 games out of 300. Then they have to see at what _points_ did they d/c? What was the status of their games at those _points_ in time? What was the team morale? Were they tilted, how many people were trying to surrender etc. Was Player X one of the people trying to surrender there? Did he say or type anything to indicate that he was going to AFK? With the number of reports and such that they get daily, do you think that they would? That's a lot of data to compile considering that they have a mountain of reports to sift through. \n\nSo from what I know, regardless of good games or bad. If you d/c over a limited number of times acceptable, you end up punished for it. Its unfortunate that those with bad internet get shafted for this but like I said, Riot probably doesn't want to spend too much time to investigate someone's internet issues. Because at the end of the day, if you d/c then you're still ruining the experience of others playing the game. And they just look at that because its their business being affected. \n\nNow, I'll give you this. The information that I know _is given by Riot_ with regards to AFK punishments.

There is no need for punishment at all.\nEven the current system doesn't punish you if you leave in 1 out of 200 games. Punishment should in general only happen if somebody quits repeatetly. And I would like to see repeated ragequit punished harder than just people with repeated dc, or important thing irl. Give player x from my example 5 games in 20 minute low priority queue, and player y 30 games in low priority.\n\nMost of riots report / and punishment system is already 100% done with machines. And I think this can be handled with an algorithm aswell. Riot games saves all data about every match for years. That's why you can still look up games from 5 years or longer ago in the match history. And I don't even think this algorithm is that difficult to code either, I could probably do that in a few days.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"FioraWillCarry","date":"2020-01-08T16:37:49.357+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Glory97,realm=EUW,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=5AdqKcvF,comment-id=00050000,timestamp=2020-01-07T16:15:32.740+0000)\n>\n> And every single game he disconnects from he is performing extremly poorly and his team is loosing hard aswell. \n\nSo he should stay in the game?

But I think it's possible for an algorithm to include that.\n\nAnd I don't want to punish anyone who plays to win and feeds and happens to dc.\nBut if we specifically check a player for only the games he afks in and it turns out that in the 20 games he afks he is significantly behind every single time i think we can be sure that he isn't playing to win and just gives up when he is not carrying. The odds that a player with bad connection who is trying to win just happens to have a dc in only the 20 games he is not doing well in is so extremly small that it basically doesn't happen.","replies":[]}]}]}
