System itself is fine. It just needs better, finer tuning.\n\nFervor still is in the game. At least, an altered Season 6 version that nearly broke Aatrox and Kayle in the form of Press The Attack.\n\nIf Conqueror is ever to be changed to appear more like Season 7 Fervor, which gave AD, itÂ´ll likely just be a PTA that gives AD instead of increasing your damage by a percentage.","replies":[{"poster":"mohamadsia","date":"2018-07-30T19:31:23.869+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"@SithesisLord\nwhat u take on katarina ? my rune page was +19magic pen, now it is +12-15 (i cant remember) from sudden impact and rest of dmg from thunder\nwhat i take on trynd ? 48AD + 20% Armor Pen, what i get now is  10AD + 20% True Dmg\nmaybe a nerf even,","replies":[{"poster":"TheSingularity","date":"2018-07-31T00:41:39.087+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"The days of full scaling AD illaoi.

Just like they didn't need to change zac or vel'koz. All they did was add more variables making balancing harder, buffing already strong masteries and removing my personal favourite (CoC).
