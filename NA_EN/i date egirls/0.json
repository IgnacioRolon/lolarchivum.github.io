This ping spike would go on for as long as you were in the game until you restarted your client? I lost both games cause of this issue, why is this even happening and why am I losing LP in ranked because of the fact that riot is causing people to have 6000 ping spikes and AFKing?\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have any idea as to why this is happening... I am 100% sure this is not luck based as it happened 2 times in a row. My friend is also constantly getting it in her games aswell. \r\n\r\nFriend in ARAM Lagging: https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/329978324715831298/374184945335271424/unknown.png","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-30T00:29:27.514+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is this happening 100% of the time for every single player in the match or only partially? A lot of this depends on how well your own network is configured as well, so it's always good to start with the basics. \n\nAdjust your Port Forwarding and DNS connections really quickly for me using those steps in the [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) and also make sure you have the option \"Close Client during Game\" checked in the client settings. Test those in a custom or practice game and let me know how it helps.","replies":[]}]}
