This ping spike would go on for as long as you were in the game until you restarted your client? I lost both games cause of this issue, why is this even happening and why am I losing LP in ranked because of the fact that riot is causing people to have 6000 ping spikes and AFKing?\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have any idea as to why this is happening... I am 100% sure this is not luck based as it happened 2 times in a row. My friend is also constantly getting it in her games aswell.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-30T03:11:26.990+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm seeing quite a few of these reports tonight and I'm starting to wonder if this might be some damaged node that is affecting a large amount of people. If you could, I want to have you guys all run a quick traceroute to see what your connection looks like after it leaves your network. Use a tool like [WinMTR](http://winmtr.net/winmtr-v0-92-now-available/) to run a trace to the EUNE servers at 31.186.224.42 and paste the results here for me.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MrBrzi","date":"2017-10-30T00:22:26.874+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"2 games in row me and my friends got a 7000 ping in ranked so i lose LP.... :(","replies":[]},{"poster":"Healthy","date":"2017-10-29T14:25:36.916+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol me and my friend getting 7k lag spikes also.
