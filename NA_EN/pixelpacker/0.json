I also haven't gotten one honor capsule drop since I have become honor 5 and it has been about half a month of honor 5. Thank you for reading if you did!","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-25T02:48:16.626+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Keep in mind that these drops will still only give so much per cycle. For instance, you can still only get a maximum of [**12 key fragments per 4-week cycle**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207884233). They should be evenly spread throughout, but it sounds like they may have mostly dropped towards the beginning of the period for you.","replies":[{"poster":"PixelPacker","date":"2017-09-25T05:06:14.767+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for responding!
