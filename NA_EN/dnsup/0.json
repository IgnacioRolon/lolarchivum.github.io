I then opened two hextech chests.\r\n\r\n* Upon clicking the \"open\" button the first time, a chest &amp; key were consumed and I received loot.\r\n\r\n* Upon clicking the \"open\" button again (to trigger the opening of a second chest), the client froze.\r\n\r\n* I closed the client.\r\n\r\n* Upon opening the client again, no loot had been rewarded for the second chest, but a chest and a key had been removed.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n**Q1**: Is this a known bug?  (I.e., should I submit this to the bug report board also? I didn't see it there or in the knowledge base.)\r\n\r\n**Q2**: Is there any fix? (I.e., is there any way to recover either the loot that should have been awarded, or the chest and the key?)\r\n\r\n(Note: thanks in advance for help. I don't remember the last time I had to contact support.)","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-03-06T00:35:46.659+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What you experienced can happen if your connection briefly fluctuates to our servers.

Thank you so much  for responding.\n\nI didn't realize that icons were potential loot; I haven't played much in recent years.\n\nCheers.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"mark00s","date":"2017-03-06T16:39:17.776+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nice icon tho ;)","replies":[]}]}
