Now they are here, in coop vs ai. Those are bots programmed to rush lvl 30 so they can sell them [somewhere](https://www.g2g.com/league-of-legends/account-22666-22667)\nSeriously, this is getting horrible. Whenever you play against bots (AI) you usually get up to 4 bots in your team. YOUR team. \nI mean, not a lot of players play against AI, but some people just use it to rush missions o for the first victory of the day (I think Its correct to use the mode if you don't have time to play a full 30 min match) but... Please riot do something, It's not fun at all to play with for bots that die almost instantly and do literally nothing...\n\nIf you want to know if a player is a bot... Just look for the ghost + heal. They are ALWAYS bots. And I'm really getting tired...\n\naaanad another f** game with 4 bots riot im moving to dota i swear ","replies":[{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2020-01-08T16:38:30.611+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"just to let you know, Riot bans bots in waves.
