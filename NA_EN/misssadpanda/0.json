This is a tad bit annoying because I've been getting spammed by what I can only assume is some bot account. The name is always a random bunch of numbers and letters that I don't recognize as someone I have played with before.\r\nSo basically what I'm asking here is there another way to block that type of notification?","replies":[{"poster":"Injusted","date":"2017-10-21T13:12:42.352+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just got one recently, too. I woke up to see a friend request. I declined it, but if I keeps showing, I'll let you know.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-31T20:37:44.363+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just a bunch of numbers?  That's strange, and I'd be happy to take a look at that request if you want to toss the name my way.  I don't see that feature up yet on the updated client, but it's still in testing.  If it comes down to it, you can use the legacy version for now to block the player.\n\n-  On the login screen of the open beta updated client, look for the \"Launch Legacy Client\" text at the bottom.\n-  Or create a shortcut directly to the legacy client in your League Installation. Just look for \"lol.launcher\" \n\nI don't have any info on when or what options will become available, but I hope that can help alleviate things for now!","replies":[{"poster":"MissSadPanda","date":"2017-03-31T21:55:43.634+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So I think the account was banned because when I went back to look at it, it wasn't there anymore.
