From the voiceover to the overall gameplay, I always get the chills when anything involving Kindred&#039;s story is mentioned.\n\nI was reading through Kindred&#039;s voiceover (looking for some stuff on how Kindred could be Jhin - it&#039;s a theory, look it up!), and I&#039;ve got to say, Kindred has some incredibly chilling quotes.\n\n#Upon buying {{item:3026}} Guardian Angel\n- Wolf: *&quot;For us, or them?*\n\n---\n\n#During the Death Screen\n\n - Lamb: *&quot;What do all stories have in common, dear Wolf?&quot;*\n  - Wolf: *&quot;They end.&quot;*\n\n ---\n\n - Wolf: *&quot;Lamb, tell me a story.&quot;*\n  - Lamb: *&quot;There was once a pale man with dark hair who was very lonely.&quot;*\n    - Wolf: *&quot;Why was it lonely?&quot;*\n      - Lamb: *&quot;All things must meet this man, so they shunned him.&quot;*\n        - Wolf: *&quot;Did he chase them all?&quot;*\n          - Lamb: *&quot;He took an axe and split himself in two right down the middle.&quot;*\n            - Wolf: *&quot;So he would always have a friend?&quot;*\n              - Lamb: *&quot;So he would always have a friend.&quot;*\n\n---\n\n#Movement\n - Lamb: *&quot;Those who run from death... stood still in life.&quot;*\n\n---\n\n - Wolf: *&quot;And everywhere Lamb went...&quot;*\n  - Lamb: *&quot;... Wolf was sure to follow.&quot;*\n\n---\n\n - Lamb: *&quot;And everywhere Lamb went...&quot;*\n  - Wolf: *&quot;Wolf was sure to follow!&quot;*\n\n---\n\n#Taunting an enemy {{champion:6}} Urgot\n\n - Lamb: *&quot;Sometimes, death is a blessing.&quot;*\n\n---\n\n#Upon marking an enemy\n\n - Lamb: *&quot;Treasure your final moments.&quot;*\n\n - Lamb: *&quot;Eternal twilight calls for you.&quot;*\n\n - Lamb: *&quot;A fine life reaches its conclusion.&quot;*\n\n - Lamb: *&quot;Our mark looms over you.&quot;*\n\n---\n\n#Upon killing a hunted enemy\n\n - Lamb: *&quot;All your life has led to this moment.&quot;*\n\n - Lamb: *&quot;All life is temporary.&quot;*\n\n - Lamb: *&quot;All things, great and small...&quot;*\nWolf: *&quot;... **die**.&quot;*\n\n---\n\n#Upon casting Lamb&#039;s Respite\n\n - Lamb: *&quot;Shine once more, before the end.&quot;*\n\n - Lamb: *&quot;Savour life&#039;s closing act.&quot;*\n\n - Lamb: *&quot;Not here, not yet.&quot;*\n\n---\n\nOne of the coolest things about Kindred is the fact that they are so incredibly well-represented as Life & Death, Yin & Yang. Lamb is white, Wolf is black; Lamb is somber, Wolf is playful; Lamb has a soft voice, Wolf has a rugged voice.\nIt's beautiful, really, and unlike Lamb's quote, *\"Beauty fades. That is why it is beautiful\"*, the incredible design behind Kindred will never fade.\nhttp://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/a/a2/Kindred_The_Wolf_1.png/revision/latest?cb=20150915211231","replies":[{"poster":"Nanuk Pihoqahiak","date":"2016-04-29T18:31:13.500+0000","up_votes":51,"down_votes":1,"body":"I felt the gameplay left a lot to be desired.

Preventing death for a short time makes some sense, but healing afterwards? That is the opposite of death, that is giving life, it doesn't fit. \n\nAnd I said from a gameplay perspective you fool, which it most certainty does not, that's a tank ult they're flinging around.","replies":[]},{"poster":"YCitizenSnipsY","date":"2016-05-01T17:00:13.157+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"I don't think it works that way.

The Greeks made sure that they buried their dead with coins so that they could pay him to carry them to the underworld. Being left without coins meant that you couldn't pass on. Same kinda deal with Kindred - though in their case, they basically just take everyone without thinking about it. \n\nAlso note that Lamb's Respite only lasts for a few seconds.

If you've ever seen DeathNote, it's similar to Misa's situation. She was meant to die at the hands of one of her deranged fans, but a shinigami killed the guy before he could kill Misa. So, her life was extended. \n\nLamb's Respite is something similar, but if we were to translate it out of the game, it'd be more of you getting a lucky break when you should have died. So, if you about to get hit by a bus and Kindred knew it wasn't your time yet, you'd somehow miraculously get out of the way or only get injured by it. \n\nIt doesn't entirely explain the Kindred's abilities, but I hope that explanation helps somewhat.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Bârd","date":"2016-04-30T00:04:31.739+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"When they were developing Kindred, they were thinking of opposites that they felt suited eachother.\n\nPeace and Chaos.\nMercy and Cruelty.\nMalice and Innocence.\nCoolness and Excitation.\nSophistication and Savagery.\nLight and Dark.\n\nIn that brainstorm, they put \"Life and Death\" in that.\n\nThe ultimate temporarily lets all within it live, but as we all know, everything goes to hell once the thing ends.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"VendettaX4","date":"2016-04-29T20:52:57.391+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Let's just hope they make a reverse kindred skin with wolf being the archer and lamb being the floating head","replies":[]},{"poster":"AnonymousPoro","date":"2016-04-29T18:39:41.632+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"Wolf's always there, even if it is a smaller role.\n\nWolf's main ability, W, allows Kindred to Q quicker, which is her main ability.\nLamb always sends Wolf to deal the killing blow when they E.\n\nHe's always there, working in unison with Lamb.","replies":[{"poster":"Narasimha","date":"2016-04-29T20:03:37.742+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"By this logic Lulu and Pix are partners.\n\nBut... thats definitely not the case.","replies":[{"poster":"VentusDragoon","date":"2016-04-30T05:45:15.038+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Pix also doesn't enable 80% of Lulu's overall damage, unless you're leveling her E first.","replies":[{"poster":"Narasimha","date":"2016-04-30T12:35:47.227+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Pix helps Lulu's passive, her Q, her W, and her E.\nWolf helps Kindred's W and her E. \n\nSo...

They're not gods/death, they're the balance of nature. It's something that the lore needed, because Runeterra used to be vague in terms of what everybody believed in, and it still is vague. There is no determined religion (partially because I think Riot doesn't want to bring religion into the mix) that characters within the game believe in, other than a few characters like Illaoi.\n\nChampions like Bard and Kindred bring in the balance of how everything works - it makes Runeterra seem a lot more mythical, in a sense, and while some people particularly don't like the mythical element and like to go for a more realistic element, Aurelion Sol, Bard, and Kindred bring in a lot of mythical background that may help avid lore-readers understand Runeterra and it's existence a lot better.\n\nIn my eyes, champions that bring a mythical or mystical element into the lore is really healthy for the game. As a bonus, Riot doesn't over-glorify these champions and make them seem as powerful as they are in the lore as they are in the game. Kindred, for example, represents life and death - in the lore, they kill, primarily; there is no escaping Kindred's arrow or teeth. Once you have been marked, *\"Eternal life calls for you\"*, and that's it.\nHowever, in actual gameplay, Kindred's ult, Lamb's Respite, people often refer to it as Lamb is able to decide who lives, and who dies, yet this completely goes against the lore.\n\nYou see, Riot doesn't always tie their champions into the lore 100% of the time, which is actually good for champions like Aurelion Sol. While they stay true to the lore, it's not always accurate, and their power is usually limited significantly. That would be rather overpowered if Aurelion Sol could literally make a life-sized star on Summoner's Rift. His Q, however, is similar to that, but it's incredibly scaled down.","replies":[{"poster":"YCitizenSnipsY","date":"2016-05-01T18:57:55.177+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"They might as well be gods.
