In reality, even champs with a 1% play rate have THOUSANDS of dedicated and passionate players, even if they do not make themselves verbally known.\n\nWhen these players become sufficiently motivated to complain, they will do so. The boards is the way to do that. That's why it seems like these people just \"happen\" to be mains of obscure champions, because they don't come to the boards regularly.","replies":[{"poster":"SKT T1 LaFlame","date":"2016-05-17T12:51:36.316+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"thank you for facilitating good discussion and answering the question i asked, upvote sir","replies":[]},{"poster":"LordGeovanni","date":"2016-05-16T20:15:42.792+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"much like you dont protest until things get bad or are announced to get bad but you don't doubt alot of people living in the city","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Shenmue","date":"2016-05-16T18:19:08.688+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"look at my account i mained malz b4 the rework now just the idea of playing him disgust me becausei hate op champs","replies":[{"poster":"Utility Veigar","date":"2016-05-16T18:45:38.331+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"Oh you're one of those special snowflakes that like to play underrated champs to feel special and unique.","replies":[{"poster":"Shenmue","date":"2016-05-16T19:07:43.127+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"ohhh look what we got here, you're one of thoses special snowflakes that have to try to humiliate other peoples on a online board to feel special and unique such originalities much wow !!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"deadlychuck","date":"2016-05-17T16:49:11.763+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Personally i agree, in the sense that, i've always hated to play the OP champions, not because they are strong, but because the champions who are OP in almost all cases require little skill or continued effort once learned, to utilize their power. \n\nFor example, the 2nd highest ban champion right now is zed. I don't play him, not because he is strong, but rather because he's far to easy to actually use.\n\nPeople seem to think that OP = Power, but they're wrong in that sense. \nOP = Power + Ease of Use.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Paroe","date":"2016-05-16T18:50:14.031+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Shenmue,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=ot5VdiEi,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2016-05-16T18:19:08.688+0000)\n>\n> look at my account i mained malz b4 the rework now just the idea of playing him disgust me becausei hate op champs\n\nHes not OP =/ \n\nHe has good objective-focused clears.

I don't even play ranked, and i no longer play the champion. It's just not fun to do so now that they've gutted the complexity of his kit, and redistributed the majority of his power to a skill which, basically, automatically kills the target.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AstÃ´lfo","date":"2016-05-16T19:41:25.912+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"People bitch about anything and everything :P","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jbels","date":"2016-05-16T17:27:58.839+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Former Morde main here, I'm sure you can guess where I was when Morde was butchered","replies":[]},{"poster":"Arkale","date":"2016-05-16T17:25:12.019+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But...
