There was a blackout. After 10 min it was fixed and I joined the game. I told my team what happened and apologized. We WON the game. I did NOT lose it.  And I lost my promos beacuse I was AFK  \" the entire game\" even tho I came back... Why?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-12-12T17:35:04.284+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, sorry to hear about the power going off here.  :(  Even if your team wins, anyone who is marked as a leaver per [leaverbuster](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ) will receive a loss.  It sounds like you were gone for long enough to get marked as a leave in this case.  Hopefully the issue causing the power loss is resolved now so you can continue on with your series.  Good luck!","replies":[]}]}
