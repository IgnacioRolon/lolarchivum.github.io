It looks like you're using a very old installer; the game client in your screenshot is several years old and isn't directed to the right place to receive the newest patch. Please uninstall the old game client and install this one from our website: \n\nhttps://signup.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/signup/redownload\n\nIf you're still having trouble launching or patching the game with the current client installed, a permissions issue is usually the reason for problems to occur. Check out our KB here for details on launching the game as an Administrator: \n\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202969434-Patching-Issues#wq4\n\nIf you're still having issues, please contact us on the Support Site and provide your Process List, the Launcher, and Patcher logs (we've detailed how to get those logs in these locations: \n\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752674-Network-System-and-League-of-Legends-Logs#wq3 \n\nand \n\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752674-Network-System-and-League-of-Legends-Logs#wq6 ) \n\nWe'll take a deeper look at the information in there and see what could be causing the game to not launch properly.","replies":[{"poster":"Arouthor","date":"2016-02-11T01:36:56.093+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you!

If you're inquiring about the validity of your promotional code--I'm guessing you may have purchased the physical Collector's Edition which explains why you have access to the old installer--I recommend contacting my colleagues through the Support Site so they can further investigate it for you:\n\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/requests/new","replies":[]}]}]}]}
