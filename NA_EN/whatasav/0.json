I have high quality high speed internet and it runs great. So I don't understand why I can't play a game of league now without lagging consistently throughout the game? Sometimes it completely disconnects me for about a minute. Other times everything is just delayed by at least a few seconds and it seems to get worse when I am around other champions. I don't see why I would call my ISP as my internet is running perfectly fine and I am the only one using it. It can't be a computer issue either because I have a nice Alienware laptop that runs other games fine... and my fps while I play league is always about 50-60 sometimes drops to 30s. I used the repair LoL function that's available on the Launch screen several times. I'm debating on whether or not I should uninstall the game completely and then reinstall but I'm not sure if that would do anything so I thought I'd see if anyone else has an idea? Any help is greatly appreciated.\nThanks","replies":[{"poster":"tintinchi","date":"2015-03-11T08:37:35.019+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same thing happens to me, I already sent a ticket. If they insist it's my internet I'm quitting, I'm sure they won't mind 1 player leaving.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DocReverb","date":"2015-03-11T08:46:11.314+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea, I just got Leavebuster'd 20 minutes or so because of this. All I was doing was Jungling with Vi(in Normals), then out of nowhere I get an fps drop from 60 to 2-5 and finally crashed. I couldnt reconnect, so I got punished for it. I used the repair tool as well, but that didnt do anything. They need to fix this pretty badly, I cant enjoy a game without being in fear of randomly disconnecting  and not being able to reconnect. The only reason I have a record is because of this crap. So tired of leavebuster. I'm making a ticket about this right now, glad im not the only one","replies":[]}]}
