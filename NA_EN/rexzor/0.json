It was going well till the recent update, now my fps drops really far. I turned it off noticed a huge improvement, but after the game i remembered how long it takes to get back to the lobby. Does anyone know of a solution to this, or do I have to choose between better game quality, or more convenience after the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-09T03:29:11.129+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Let's do some basic steps really quickly by checking for any possible driver updates you might have missed first, but also check to see if the Windows Game DVR Bar was turned back on after a Windows Update. That feature has been known to cause some fps issues for a lot of players.\n\nIt might be best to leave that option turned on if nothing else seems to help though!
