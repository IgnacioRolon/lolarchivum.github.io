Makes it pretty helpful to see what you're experiencing.\n\nSince your ping and FPS doesn't change at all, I'd say this is likely a result of packet loss.  Dropped packets = client can't update your position = everything skips around.\n\nI'd recommend going through our [Connection Troubleshooting](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) Guide (particularly the wired vs. wireless connection).
