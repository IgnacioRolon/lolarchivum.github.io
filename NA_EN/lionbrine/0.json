Since the 1350 rp skins will go on sale the second week they are out, can you add some sort of clarity when releasing the skins so that people will know that the skins will be going on sale? Usually we see skins on sale the initial week and then go back to full price after. I know that the company needs to make money and that is good because I love this game, but I could see that people might get mad about buying them the first week when they are out only to realize that they are on sale the second week?","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-09-01T16:47:08.740+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We currently have a PBE post explaining the dates and additional information.
