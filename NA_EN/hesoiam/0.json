But most people don't go to the point where they are breaking the ToS of the game. Now, to be permabanned you must have had:\n\nA warning\n2 chat bans\nA 14 week ban\n\nAnd yet you still failed to change?\n\nEither that or you triggered a zero-tolerance word that riot doesn't want anyone in their games saying. Usually racist/homobic remarks or death wishes, both of which has an extremely negative effort on people.\n\nEither way, you won't be unbanned.\nBetter start levelling a new account and keeping calmer than before","replies":[{"poster":"PrettyGirlsFeet","date":"2019-08-16T12:03:25.979+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"there's no warning before the first chat ban","replies":[{"poster":"Cind3rkick","date":"2019-08-16T12:21:52.883+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Isn't there?

This was back in the Tribunal era.  The problem with the warning is that during that era, there was no way to verify if those reports are valid or not (until your case go to Tribunal to be judged).  People who got the warning pop-ups freaked out and thought their accounts are getting banned.  They flooded support tickets asking about the warning.  Rito put a stop to that due to the confusion (because report =/= punish even in the Tribunal era).\n\nI honestly think such a warning pop-up could potentially work nowadays with the help of the IFS because Rito does have the capability that the Tribunal lacked to verify if reports against you are valid or not within short amount of time and warn you before you get to the punishment stage.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Imperial Pandaa","date":"2019-08-16T13:40:11.883+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It used to exist, but too many people got confused by it apparently.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CharDeeMcDenniz","date":"2019-08-16T12:14:40.892+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"good thing it tells you what not to do in the ToS that you agreed to when installing the game and then re-agree to with every major patch","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-08-16T11:59:20.838+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your opinion of the rules is of zero relevance. When a cop stops you for going 40 in a 25 zone, you can claim \"I think the limit should be 45 here\" all you want. You're still getting a ticket. If a librarian asks you to keep your voice down while you use the facilities, shouting that libraries should be loud will simply get you escorted out. If you go to a friend's house who insists that you remove your shoes while you're in their home, \"that's a stupid rule and I do what I want\" will lose you a friend. If you are using someone else's services, facilities, equipment, etc., you abide by their rules or you deal with the consequences. If you think the rules should change, that is a completely different conversation (and I wouldn't give a plugged nickel for your chances at convincing Riot to change their rules to allow behavior like yours).\n\nFrom [Riot's support knowledgebase](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/360024051193-Understanding-Different-Ban-Types-FAQs):\n\n> We work with the overall community and within our own company guidelines to identify what disruptive behavior is and what the consequences for those behaviors should be. We understand that it can be difficult to know where the line is, which is why we provide chat logs and we have a few tiers in the ban process in order to allow for you to learn and grow.\n\nRiot's punishment system used to hand out stacking chat restrictions, such that consistently toxic players basically had a permanent chat restriction. Unfortunately, it turns out that such players used their few chat opportunities to be toxic, and, when they couldn't be as toxic as they wanted to, they resorted to committing non-chat offenses such as griefing (following someone around and taking their farm, using wall abilities to interfere with their play, etc.) or inting. The purpose of the punishment system is to eliminate rule-breaking, not make it worse. Thus, if a couple chat restrictions don't make any difference in a player's misbehavior, the system ramps up the punishments until the player is permabanned and thus unable to use that account to break any more rules ever again.\n\nDid you find something in Riot's store [allowing you to break the ToS](https://i.imgur.com/AvDSnZF.png)? No, because such a service is not offered. Regardless of how much money you spend, you are required to follow the same rules as everyone else. If the IFS determines that you've been validly reported in violation of those rules, you'll be punished according to those rules. If you wanted to avoid a punishment, you should've followed the rules.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Prandine","date":"2019-08-16T13:36:13.055+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Chat restrictions and bans only can only do so much on their own, and it's up to the players themselves to actually work to rectify what's wrong in their behavior. In your case you were given at least 3 chances to improve your behavior and were even warned at the 14-day ban that the next punishment would be a permaban. It's not Riot's fault that you chose to disregard the warnings, nor is it a sign that they don't care about their players. On the contrary, it shows that they care enough that they're willing to remove people who have shown an unwillingness to behave properly despite all the chances given to them.

If you can't be bothered to listen to three separate warnings _at the very least_, then, why should your main account be given a fourth try? You've already proven three separate times that you don't care about the rules.\n\n>My opinion is that if you're worth getting your account back, you wouldn't have gotten it banned in the first place.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PrettyGirlsFeet","date":"2019-08-16T12:03:46.430+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"disable chat it will deter you from flaming","replies":[]},{"poster":"FURRY V2","date":"2019-08-16T11:22:46.977+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"I love how those kind of people speak in the majesty plural.\n> everybody gets angry when somebody trolls their 3rd game in a row \n\nI had a 7 lose streak with 0/7 mids and the like, yet I am still not banned or even punished.\n\nSeriously, I start to think that, people without any punishments are like some kind of weirdo or unbelievable phenomenons.\n\nOh I am special, it feels so good.{{champion:350}}","replies":[]}]}
