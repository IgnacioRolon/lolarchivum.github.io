Ever since the leak that was here earlier, and maybe that was just something someone wished to see which they then called a 'leak', everyone has been talking about 'Ivern the Cruel'. A skin that would have been the only one of his kind for this champion, making him sort of edgy, alligning with his backstory.\r\nDunkmaster Ivern, unlike this, has nothing to do with his backstory. Nothing to do with his personality or abilities, and looks like a last minute idea for wanting a Dunkmaster skin and an Ivern skin but not coming up for things for both, so just combining them. His abilities look decent, and so does the splash art, but it is not on an epic skin level, atleast for in 2019. (But that's not what this is about) \r\n\r\nI hope enough people will complain about this skin not being fitting for Ivern, despite it looking pretty smooth and decent, and the people working on the Dunkmaster Ivern skin will decide to create something else, maybe with this or instead of this. The people having waited 2 years for a skin for a single champion, and there are more than you would expect, deserve something that's better for him and his backstory.\r\n\r\nLast but not least, talking about the people that have waited for this skin. They have been coming up with amazing ideas and making awesome fanart- Maybe this company should start listening to their fans and giving them what they actually want. ~~ It would be good for both sides! ~~","replies":[]}
