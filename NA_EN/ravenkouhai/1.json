With Veigar, he just got straight nerfs. There's not really anything to be misunderstood. His stun now has a one second delay, his CDs increased, his Q's a skillshot and is thus unreliable. What's the redemption? He can get two ap with one Q? It doesn't matter when any assassin can still destroy him, since he can't stop them anymore. Tons of PBE testers told riot it was a bad idea. People wrote long rants about why the changes were actually huge nerfs. Still pushed out to Live. The quality of a skin is important enough to delay, but not changes that 90% of people don't like? They'll listen to PBE testers about a skin quality, but not actual champion balance.
