Spam Bundle**\" appears to be the title of the newest group of assassin skins to be added to the shop. Riot, can we stop acting as if this gesture is cute or funny and quit advertising it as though it is?\n\nAlso anyone who has watched the pro LCS games would probably note several times a caster would refer to a play as, \"That's definitely a question mark ping play there\" or \"This is the part where the question mark pings start getting spammed\". \n\nI understand that a lot of Riot's staff also participate in solo queue and are probably just trying to relate to the average player base, but I think it's being done in poor taste. This is not a friendly (or correct) usage of the ping more often than not, and these Riot acknowledgments only confirm that. \n\nRiot, if you want to remove the negative stigma that this game has attached to it regarding its toxic community, then you might want to start by not endorsing it yourselves.","replies":[]}
