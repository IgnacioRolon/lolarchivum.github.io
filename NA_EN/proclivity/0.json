So if a specialist went through it, he's likely to have received a CR at the minimum as well. Like Arammus said, don't indulge in competitive banter. The system can't gauge if you're actually being an ass or just playing along. But once you get reported, it _will_ register that you _are_ being an ass because _someone_ was offended.","replies":[{"poster":"Proclivity","date":"2019-12-16T16:08:26.912+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Yin Yang Taoist,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=Z8dpMFVP,comment-id=000200000000,timestamp=2019-12-15T18:30:37.624+0000)\n>\n> {{sticker:sg-miss-fortune}} \n> \n> The context in which he used the word 'gay' or 'virgin' were derogatory as well.

They added me after to mock me (send that with the report in my ticket so I'm hoping Riot will do something...). Sucks that Riot claims that you can banter/bs but even saying something as small as \"idiot\" or \"dumb\" to someone being dumb gets punished. Makes me just not want to use chat period. \nBeen playing this game for like 6 years now and I see the words idiot and dumb all the time.
