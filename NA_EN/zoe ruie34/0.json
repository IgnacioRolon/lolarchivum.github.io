I said if you've already all of your key fragments you may need to wait for those to refresh as they do every roughly 28 days. You obviously have a better chance of getting a capsule if you have all of your key fragments available as opposed to only having 1 fragment available.","replies":[{"poster":"AnataBakka","date":"2017-08-29T07:30:43.340+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Think about \"chance\".

I doubt that Riot has set them up this way. I would guess that there's some sort of correction factor involved, where your chance of getting an honor capsule at any given opportunity increases if you haven't gotten one in a long time.","replies":[{"poster":"AnataBakka","date":"2017-08-29T17:59:27.873+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It would be nice if it's like that, which means there should be a time in which you have 100% of getting them, but they didn't mention anything about this","replies":[{"poster":"Mr Wind Up Bird","date":"2017-08-29T18:18:46.418+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's no reason to treat pure random chance as the default. My suggestion is consistent with how keys are dropped and similar practices elsewhere, both by Riot games and across the industry, which is why I think it's more likely.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"NS360M8","date":"2017-08-29T03:26:33.002+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Please read the Honor System page please ... jesus.\nHonor rewards are only at the end of the season not when you get to a certain honor level.\nGo there and read the page.","replies":[{"poster":"Zoe RuIe34","date":"2017-08-29T11:36:47.057+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I never said anything about honor rewards.
