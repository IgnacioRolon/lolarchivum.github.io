The smallest suggestion from anyone creates a ticking bomb, that&#039;ll result in a chain reaction. If I tell someone that we should go baron, the answer is mostly: &#039;&#039;STFU!&#039;&#039; and they proceed to try to 1v5 the enemy team. And they&#039;re usually very negative. If someone on our team dies first - its gg. Ff15.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions on how I can make my team more positive?","replies":[{"poster":"Shad√≤w","date":"2017-11-23T19:41:38.275+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Be toxic too","replies":[]},{"poster":"Woodakoodashooda","date":"2017-11-23T19:59:12.882+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can't make anyone be anything.\n\nIt is what it is.\n\nMute any player who exhibits toxic behavior towards anyone and just play the game.\n\nWhen you've silenced those players, you will find yourself surrounded by players who aren't egocentric keyboard warriors.","replies":[]},{"poster":"I am Pacman","date":"2017-11-23T19:57:48.919+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I pretty much only play league with at least one friend now.   Spam pinging sometimes works, or pinging twice but like 10 seconds apart 1 min before dragon or baron spawns.  This notifies people that it is coming up and then people start moving towards the objective during the second pings with the message \"please come\".  Typically you have to notify people at least a minute in advance at what you want to do (splitpush so they go to a specific lane, group and shove, baron, dragon etc) in order for them to wrap their heads around the fact that its a good idea.\n\nThe flip side is that sometimes I'm 5/0 hitting the top inhib with 2-3 people defending it and I can write out sentences explaining what to do in order to win and they will just sit in their lanes and farm.  People are stupid and they won't all listen to you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Quil Evrything","date":"2017-11-23T19:53:54.422+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"/mute all","replies":[]},{"poster":"d1v1ne beast","date":"2017-11-23T19:39:32.388+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"play with your friends","replies":[]}]}
