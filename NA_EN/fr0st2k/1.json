You win, you gain elo, you lose, you lose elo. If you did a 10 win streak and 2 lost... you were still way higher than where you were before those 12 games.

One could get carried beyond one's skill level from teammates just as easily as getting dragged down by a teammate. That's why you can still be demoted.

You perform, get to 100 lp, you get promoted.\n\nsimple\n\nYou fall, hit zero. Okay now you can't lose. You lose after zero. you get demoted.\n\nsimple.\n\nYou hit 100 you deserved the upper spot because you climbed to the top of your current division or whatever you want to call it.\n\nIf you hit 0 then you obviously are underperforming and deserve to be demoted lower until you get back to 100 in the lower division and prove you deserve to be back where you were.\n\nThe promo games do nothing but force you to play more games for no real reason aside from Riot said so. I mean, the background is the same as it was before the LP system, but they have even labeled the bronze, silver, gold etc in a way that even promotes segregation in the community that wasn't there before.
