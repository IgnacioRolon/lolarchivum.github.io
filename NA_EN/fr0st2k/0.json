They ignore their non duo teammates at vital moments and ruin the entire experience of a solo queue.\r\n\r\nSame for trio and quad (quad obviously being the absolute worst).\r\n\r\nI don&#039;t know why Riot allows this shit. I personally don&#039;t care. It just has to go.\r\n\r\nIf there is an issue where they feel that matchmaking is going to be affected, here is the answer:\r\n\r\n1.Add a flag for players who participate in duo games. These are &#039;soloduos&#039;\r\n2.First try and match a duo and a trio.\r\n3.If that doesn&#039;t work match 2 duos together with a &#039;soloduo&#039;.\r\n4.Allow people to voluntarily enter this god awful duo queue if they want to.\r\n5.Let all solo players play solo.","replies":[{"poster":"OneMustFall","date":"2016-08-07T20:59:53.577+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"HELP RITO IS LETTING PEOPLE WITH FRIENDS PLAY WITH EACH OTHER IN COMPETITIVE MODES LIKE EVERY OTHER GAME!!!!!!!\n\nOMGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG","replies":[{"poster":"DJMason88","date":"2016-08-07T21:02:02.754+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Its not even that.
