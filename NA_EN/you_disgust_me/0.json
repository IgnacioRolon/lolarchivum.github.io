Rough Sketch","subforum":"Concepts & Creations","embed":{"description":null,"url":"https://imgur.com/rx0IhoJ","image":"http://imgur.com/rx0IhoJs.png"},"up_votes":57,"down_votes":0,"body":"About a year ago, someone on the boards posted a picture of what Illaoi would look like if drawn in a Gerudo BotW style. It got me wondering if anyone had drawn either Nami or Fizz in the game&#039;s style as well. But, no one bothered to post anything.\n\nSo, a few months ago, I got bored and decided to do a rough sketch of Nami incorporating the BotW Zora style myself. \nI hope you guys like it.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2018-02-16T16:34:23.157+0000","up_votes":34,"down_votes":0,"body":"I love this so much!! ಥ⌣ಥ","replies":[]},{"poster":"JPLangley","date":"2018-02-16T16:52:29.123+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"if im being totally honest\n\ni just see nami with a zora pendant","replies":[{"poster":"SpecterVonBaren","date":"2018-02-16T21:53:48.992+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The artist should have gone all the way and given her feet.","replies":[{"poster":"You Disgust Me","date":"2018-02-17T00:48:16.255+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You know, I thought the exact same thing while drawing her.
