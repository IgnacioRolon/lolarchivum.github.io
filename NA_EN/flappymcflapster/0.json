If you want a wide, diverse, interesting roster of characters, and have an explanation for why they can do the things they do, then you gotta take whats given to you. There are the characters that are straight forward, and then there are those that need a little bit of explaining to understand. \r\n\r\nThe obvious: Miss Sarah Fortune is a pirate wielding two pistols, so she shoots things. Duh. Lucian wields two pistols as well, and so, he shoots things as well. Of course. Teemo is the spawn of Satan himself, so he haunts and torments you until he finally sucks out and consumes your soul. Naturally.\r\n\r\nThe not so obvious: Tahm Kench is an entity embodying humanity&#039;s greed and gluttony, so he can eat up just about anything. Xerath is an ascended being, bordering on demi-god, so he can shoot giant beams of magical energy. Malphite is an enormous, sapient rock, so he throws rocks at you, ya know, like enormous sapient rocks would do. :P\r\n\r\nTL;DR\r\nBack on topic. My point is, these descriptions and backgrounds of the champions as well as other lore bits give us reasons for why the champions can do what they do. However, this brings up a glaring issue; how do humans wielding pistols and baby crossbows and a yordle riding on a lizard with a spear take on the demi-gods and demons of this world?\r\n\r\nI have a theory on this. Summoners Rift itself levels the playing field. During the process which transports the champions to Summoner&#039;s Rift, the super over powered creatures like Tahm Kench, Aatrox, Malphite, and Galio are stripped of their god-like power or immense size, so that the puny little beings wielding their boom sticks and pointy objects have some chance of facing down these beings.\r\n\r\nNow, at this point, you&#039;re probably saying, &quot;But Flappy, the same thing happens at Howling Abyss and Twisted Tree Line. Are you suggesting that the SAME magic is there too?&quot; Nope, not at all. Summoner&#039;s Rift and the battles held there between these champions, are actually mentioned in the lore. So, in this world, these battles between the given roster of champions are supposedly actually happening in Runeterra. On the other hand, Howling Abyss and Twisted Treeline are landmarks, locations that hold significance in this world, but the battles waged in these places didn&#039;t involve everyone you can take to fight there. So these battles are works of fiction, what if scenarios, even in universe.\r\n\r\nHow about it Riot? Am I close? Is there an in universe explanation? Or should we not think to hard about it and simply chalk it up to video logic?","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Scathlocke","date":"2018-07-27T16:24:55.098+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"League of Legends (the game) is a competitive, abstract battle fantasy using these characters.

You can be whoever you want to be, and play against whoever else is there in the two teams. Every player can be a winner, regardless of the \"in-universe power\" of a given champion.","replies":[{"poster":"Warlord Dienekes","date":"2018-07-27T16:57:24.225+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"More interesting question. How do you internd to keep the stories balanced when more and more settings are invaded by high powered magic monsters. \n\nOr in another way. How is the fight of Ashe  and Sejuani or Miss Fortune and Gangplank to remain relevant when everything they fight for and about becomes inherently pointless compared to what Volibear and Ornn or Nagakaborous can do?","replies":[{"poster":"Wrathof300","date":"2018-07-27T21:12:47.640+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Although often associated with, power level =/= importance the story. The Ornn story where fights Volibear is irrelevant to the day we receive a story with Ashe and Sejauni resulting in rippling changes to the lore imo. A story where Ornn and other demigods impact the importance of weaker characters depends on the story itself and not Ornn's power level. \n\nIn a story involving Ornn and a Frozen Watcher, in a fight Ashe could be irrelevant/ have little impact, however in the overall story she could still be written with importance, an example how, being the story of the three sister's and Ornn. Ornn was the one that created the bridge on Howling Abyss to entrapped the Watchers, however it were the sisters who were tasked with convincing him to do so, and ultimately trapping the Watchers, thus they are extremely important in that story.\n\nLikewise The Burning Tides event and similar lore changing events will stand out more than simple stories of Ornn fighting Volibear or Aurelion Sol closing a Void rift. Hence when lore changing events do involve Aurelion Sol and company it depends on the story itself how important of a role, weaker characters play. \nThe only thing the character's power levels affect is the amount of challenge a writer will face in writing a captivating story with as little plot holes possible.","replies":[{"poster":"Warlord Dienekes","date":"2018-07-28T00:40:51.594+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It kinda does, let me explain.  From a rather large scale and brutish way of looking at things, as soon as one introduces world ending events to a setting, everything that is below that threshold becomes, by definition, less important to the setting than the world destroying event.  Exploring this is pretty simple.  If the world destroying event happens then it does not matter what happened in the non-world destroying event.  Ergo, it becomes less important.\n\nBut we can look at it more clinically and in depth than that, by exploring character motivations, goals, and power structures.  To use Burning Tides event, I don't think anyone really considers the effects of, say, Aurelion Sol on that story.  Because within the context of the story Aurelion Sol might as well not exist. However, that is no longer the case in the Freljord, where Ornn and Volibear don't just exist in theory, they have now started to actually take part in the world around them.  \n\nThis is actually made apparent in your own example.  In Ornn and the Three Sisters, the three sisters are completely dependent on Ornn in order to do anything.  They are not the protagonists of this story.  Their perspective only matters in so much as it aligns with Ornn's because Ornn has the power, and they do not.  \n\nWhich brings us back to Ashe and Sejuani.  If they are in a heated battle, and the equivalent of an \"I win\" button arrives on their doorstep named Volibear, Ornn, or Anivia, or whatever other demigod comes out of the woodwork.  The battles  fought between Sej and Ashe no longer matter.  Ashe can lose every battle, so long as Ornn decides to help her in the end.  And any conflict between the two would depend on who has more of these demigods in their pocket.  If Ashe and Sejuani are rational, or at least, vaguely intelligent players on this game of politics they should realize that conflict is won through resources.  And the demigods have become the single most useful resource on the board, to the point that all other resources don't matter.\n\nThe characters of Sejuani and Ashe, their strengths and weakness that have been explained.  Sejuani's bloodlust and strive for martial dominance and honorable tradition, or Ashe's leadership and tactical acumen become irrelevant next to the single defining feature of the conflict: who can suck up to the gods so they can do the actually important stuff?\n\nThis plays out in basically every conflict.  What does Sivir have that she can use against the Ascended she has to deal with?  Logically nothing.  However, she just so happened to get a weapon that has an enchantment that reads +100 damage vs Ascended.  Is this lame?  Yes.  But it's the only way to make this interaction meaningful for the weaker party.  Because the Ascended keep getting bumped up in power, because someone on the lore team seems to think that more powerful is automatically cooler.  They're wrong.  But here we are.  The original long-lived librarian, became a warrior, became an imperial bodyguard, became a demigod, which is now apparently tied to some fundamental aspect of the universe, or something.  I don't know it's gotten stupid.\n\nYou can't give everyone +100 damage weapons against whatever ridiculously powerful creature they have to deal with.  So, if they do ever interact then the almighty will always take center stage.\n\nWith one notable exception.  It is possible for the mortal to be meaningful against the cosmic, when the cosmic is stupid.  This isn't really meant as an insult, like I did to the Ascended above.  I mean this more, that the characters have to let themselves lose or be manipulated for some reason.  Usually this reason is bad, but some fair few times it works.  Ozymandias vs Dr Manhattan qualifies.  Yes, Dr. Manhattan is the biggest idiot in these scenes, but it fits the character and the story established up to that point.  Jafar vs Aladdin is a much worse example, where Jafar the previously established hyper competent and intelligent character just let's himself lose to the hero because he for some reason didn't know a piece of trivia about a subject he has studied for his entire life. A piece of trivia that his entire plan revolved around.","replies":[{"poster":"Wrathof300","date":"2018-07-28T03:06:50.037+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> If the world destroying event happens then it does not matter what happened in the non-world destroying event.

Who has the most power when the world ending events occurs, who is affected by the world ending event and what will be the outcome of the world ending event, these are circumstances that can determined by other prior non-world ending events, that directly impact on the story of the world ending event unfolds.\n\n> This is actually made apparent in your own example.

Ornn, however, did not care to help anyone save any world, anywhere. It was for personal reasons, and he did not elaborate on the matter.\"_\nHad these 3 sisters not confront Ornn he would have done nothing against the Watcher's until they threatened him. The 3 sisters then go on to defeat the Watcher without Ornn's further assistance, this is because he is a character and not a plot device. These 3 comparably weak characters were the driving force behind a stronger character and hold equal importance in the story of the creation of Howling Abyss if not more, to Ornn.\n\n****\n> If Ashe and Sejuani are rational, or at least, vaguely intelligent players on this game of politics they should realize that conflict is won through resources.

Reav3 could say \"Oh, Nasus occasionally suffers from a mild migraine, it doesn't effect him at all though.\"  That changes our understanding of the lore.  It is also utterly insignificant to the story of Shurima.  It's barely a glip on the story of Nasus.  \n\nSo there needs to be a way to determine relevance.  And you fall into the same problem with your example as you did with the super powered individuals.  The only way you just wrote for the state of the non-powered people and their actions to be relevant is that it has some unforeseen effect on the powered people.  That still makes the powered people the important ones through which the story is framed.  The unpowered matter because a writer can shrivel a story around so that while you thought it was about one thing: Who controls Bilgewater.  It was actually setting the stage for something totally different and vastly more important: Whether the demons of the deep rise to slaughter the land dwellers or whatever nonsense.\n\n>Had these 3 sisters not confront Ornn he would have done nothing against the Watcher's until they threatened him.

These 3 comparably weak characters were the driving force behind a stronger character and hold equal importance in the story of the creation of Howling Abyss if not more, to Ornn.\n\nAnd yet they are powerless and useless without him.  Alright, let's go through events then.  If the three sisters don't go to Ornn the Watchers kill some people until Ornn gets pissed because of some other reason and builds the device to hold them.  Because he is the one that has that power.  Now, a lot more nameless and completely irrelevant people may die in this scenario.  But they don't matter, because they're fictional characters in a made up world.  The effects of which are entirely made up by the author.  If the author wants Ornn to save the world, then Ornn saves the world.  The rest is window details and window dressing because that's how stories work.\n\n>Ashe and Sej are not going to look at Ornn and Volibear from a statistical stand point like you rather a cultural one.

If you have a political goal, and the resources to obtain that goal is before you, you take that goal.  To do otherwise is to be an idiot.  These are leaders and planners, they should not be idiots.  They should realize what it means to have the powers of a god opposed to not having a god.  It's the equivalent of a modern politician and campaign funds.  The side with more funds tends to win, by a large margin.  So you set your agenda based around gaining those funds.  And much like the power differentials I'm railing against, there are people whose funds are important for a politician to acquire and many more who are basically irrelevant to the outcome of an election.\n\n>Jax has been stated to have killed Ascended when he was still human, not by himself surely and likely not without casualty but it has been done.

The heat necessary to do that is actually hotter than the surface of the sun.  Lightning travels faster than human reactions and he commands that on whim.  He has controlled people's minds in a sentence.  He creates earthquakes because he's angry.  And he can apparently sense Sivir's blood when nearby, or has some other way of tracking her.\n\nHere's how an actual interaction between him and Sivir would go.\n*BOOM*\nand Sivir dies.\n\nNow that won't happen.  Because like a cartoon villain ringing his mustache, when Sivir and Xerath meet he'll put off killing her while monologue-ing.  Or Nasus and Renekton will fight him to a standstill and Sivir will just use the weapon on him in a weakened state.  And everyone will go \"Oh Sivir's important to this story now' despite the fact that the two Ascended and the weapon actually did things, Sivir just happened to be the one holding it.  It might as well have been any random hobo off the street.  Give him the super weapon and now he too can be important to this story.  \n\nNow you can say, oh, but Sivir's blood brings back Azir!  Which just suffers from the same problem.  Sivir is only important because she happened, through no actual skill or desire of her own, to be related to the actual important people in this story.\n\n>This was solely stated for Aatrox and not all of the Ascended, while it could apply to Nasus, that is an assumption that he is linked to a celestial ideal.\n\nI think it's all of them.
