LeagueofGraphs has the first tower team winning 72% of the time this patch, which sounds like a shit ton. But what was it last patch? 70%. 6.13? 70% again. 6.12? Again, 70%. 6.11? 70%. 6.10? 70%. 6.9? 70%. 6.8? 70% 6.7? 70%. 6.6? 70%.  6.5? 70%. 6.4? 69.5%. 6.3? 70%. 6.2? 70%. 6.1? 69.5%.\n\nWhich team gets the first turret has always been a pretty good indicator of which team is going to win.
