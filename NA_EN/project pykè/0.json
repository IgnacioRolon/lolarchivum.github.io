But however there is also a mission that was added when you first log in to your account where you have to win one game and get BE Orbs. I did not get that and I was wondering why. Most of my other friends got that, so I was confused. if somebody knows why this happened please answer since im thirsty for some BE ;) . I do not know if it is a bug or is there another reason but like I said if somebody knows please answer.\r\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-11-10T21:21:09.800+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The mission containing capsules with BE were refunds for players that bought Greater Runes before September 1st.  Looking into this for you, it doesn't look like the account was eligible for conversion because no greater runes were unlocked for that period.

If you did not, then your IP will just become BE 1-to-1, and you will not have a mission to recover the IP spent on runes (the Blue Essence Orbs mission).\n\nYou can read more about the requirements to get rune reimbursement at the [Preseason Update FAQ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/115012640908-Preseason-Update-FAQ):\n\n>**Q: I bought lots of runes in the old system. Do I get anything for spending on the old runes?**\n\n>**A**:<snip>\n\n>So, for runes you **bought before the beginning of the 2017 season**, we'll give you 100 IP for each regular **tier 3 rune**, and 300 IP for each **tier 3 quint**. For any runes you bought since the beginning of the 2017 season, we’ll refund the full IP cost.\n\n>For rune pages, the plan is for your rune pages to carry over into the new runes system, so prices on rune pages aren't being changed. However we heard from some players that being able to edit rune pages in champ select makes having more than a few pages feel less meaningful. So, for **any rune page you bought with IP**, we'll also give you back 1,500 blue essence.","replies":[]}]}
