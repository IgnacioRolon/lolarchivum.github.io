I had set my username to remember me from the last time i logged in so I knew that my username was right. I also know that my password worked last time. But this didn't work. I tried going to recover my password so I typed in my account name and checked the emails that I used 5 minutes later. It wasn't on any of the emails that I always used. I tried going onto the PBE section from leagueoflegends.com but that wouldn't work either. I think that my emails, passwords, and username was changed. Does anyone know how I can get my account back?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-17T02:46:42.576+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your account may have been compromised.
