However, instead of showing me a loading screen it showed complete black, when I switched into my client, it said that I was ingame. Therefore, I could not start a match. I decided to log out and check back 2 hours later. When I logged back in it had the same issue and it would say that I can't connect to the game and to check my internet connection. \n\n\nCan someone please tell me how to fix this?\n\n\nNevermind I checked League after a day and its fixed","replies":[{"poster":"Disapointing","date":"2017-04-04T21:49:32.106+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"this has been fixed after a couple hours of waiting but I don't know why this happened. On the new client when I logged in it automatically sent me to a loading screen to get ingame, however it stayed black screen. After alt+f4-ing I pressed reconnect. It didn't change anything. I asked friends to invite me to a game however in their screen I was ingame. Well, now that doesn't happen so thank you for your time!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-02-18T22:22:58.900+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm confused, are you saying your match would load as soon as you logged into the client?  Did you have an option to reconnect to game first?  Was this on the updated client?  The updated client is still in testing, so it may be worth reporting this to the client devs over at the[ client discussion](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/alpha-client-discussion) boards.  Let me know.","replies":[]}]}
