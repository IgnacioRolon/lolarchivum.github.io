That is not how the system works at all. If that were the case, then the [PB](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation) board would be filled with players who were banned like this.\n\n>  I'm surprised they can't sue for loss of an account that was unfairly banned.\n\nYou can't sue for the loss of something you didn't own in the first place. Read the [ToU](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/legal/termsofuse), which you agreed to when you began playing (and every change of it thereafter).","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Disapointing","date":"2018-01-16T20:05:41.685+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the feedback guys!

If you dont end up feeding which i guess you dont otherwise you wouldnt try, i dont think there is a problem. Youll probably get flamed in champ select, especially in ranked. But since i changed my name to Taliyah supp and had a decent winrate (back in the day) nobody flamed me anymore. So yeah, just make sure noone tillts in champ select and you are good to go :)","replies":[]}]}
