But now it is appearing more often to the point in the past week I haven't had a single game with lower than 1 thousand ping and without a fps spike. I realized that no matter how many times I try to lower my ping or try to speed up my computer or get a new one. League will always lag, even with Riot trying as hard as they can. I have also realized that people report you if you do bad even when you say you are lagging. So I beg Riot to release a way to show your ping and fps like you can show your cooldowns, that way hopefully I will avoid some reports and we can finally tell who is lagging and who is just feeding.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-12T20:45:20.294+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"League requires a constant connection, so it's certainly possible to experience issues if your network is a bad or slow connection.
