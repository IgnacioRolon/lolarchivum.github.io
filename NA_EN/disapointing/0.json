However, right when the League of Legends logo would load up to start the game, I would receive a bugsplat. It says that I had corrupted files and that it would fix it. I was surprised at first and lost 17 lp, not too bad I guess. \n\nAfter that I was hoping that the issue was resolved and would no longer waste lp. However, this has started happening on the daily: start a game, crash, repair. \n\n\nCan anyone help????? Now I have 5 low priority matchmaking queues because of this issue. \n\n\n\nMy computer has 4 gb ram intel i5 quad core processor and windows 10. I'm pretty sure my computer can run this, so can someone tell me why this keeps happening? Thank you!\n\nAlso, I ran a virus scan and found nothing.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-07-12T22:14:37.861+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's really important to get this crash and game file corruption fixed asap before queuing up for another game, otherwise you'll likely run the risk of splatting again.  Before anything else, I recommend going over the [game crash](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes+) guide to fix this up.  Regardless of your pc spec, you can still have some bad game files or drivers that need some repair.  That should do the trick!","replies":[]}]}
