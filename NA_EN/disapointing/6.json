And recently, the lag has gotten worse. I wanted to know if there is any way to speed up my league of legends because I have gotten low priority queue due to lag. When champion select finishes, I get a black screen. However, after the black screen, normally the loading screen pops up but now I just wait for about 10 minutes then when it loads it says that the game is done, my team has remade, and that I have gotten a low priority queue. Is there any way to fix this?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-03T17:34:05.286+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It definitely sounds like your client is having a tough time establishing a stable connection to the game server.
