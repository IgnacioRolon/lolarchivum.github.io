I recently switched ISP and now have pretty high ping, I do fine when solo laning and pushing but clearly Riven does not work well with high ping. What are some good champs to use for high ping (200+) that can just solo push top lane all game? I know a lot of people say don't even play ranked but ive put a lot of time and money into this game to not play. Just have to adapt to it so any feedback helps.

ISP's control most of the factors that decide your latency (ping), so reaching out to them would be a great idea!\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[{"poster":"LaMeHD","date":"2016-12-19T02:20:34.959+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for replying, I called them and they are sending a technician out to re-install since I called them out on all of the nonsense they were trying to tell me. Ill try to post back and let everyone know what exactly the problem was just incase someone else has the same problem.","replies":[]}]}]}
