They are called ADCs or Attack Damage **Carries**. Now if you realize this. The entire game is about focusing the ADC as a team no matter what side you are on. Keep alive or kill the ADC. If the ADC is dying or staying alive your team isn't going to be having fun. Have you ever seen a team fight with the lack of people with raw damage to fight in a sustained fight. It's extremely awkward and leads to a really long fight that may not even progress the game. It looks like two teams smacking each other with wet noodles until there are only tanks left and then its just 2 fat people struggling to see who can live to force 5v4 when their team gets up. The ADC prevents the awkward really long team fights and helps allow you to push after they are over.\n\nPoint is the ADC is always the solution late game. And the way this game plays. Late game is almost always achieved its just the skill levels that make the difference.","replies":[{"poster":"LaughingMan11","date":"2015-08-06T20:19:57.518+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Jefftiffy,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Gmmh2ifu,comment-id=0000000000010000,timestamp=2015-08-06T18:27:23.274+0000)\n>\n> Point is the ADC is always the solution late game.
