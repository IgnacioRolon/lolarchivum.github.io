The community didnt suddenly rush to the defense of Rengar. We&#039;re getting invaded by a subreddit of Rengar players that are upvoting any discussion about him though the roof.\n\nThis is a huge problem because whether or not these ideas are good or bad doesn&#039;t matter. If it has to do with Rengar, its upvoted like crazy. Don&#039;t you think its a bit weird how over the course of a few days there went from being absolutely nothing about him to like 8 threads on the front page at all times?\n\nIts also snuffing out the other discussions we are trying to have by kicking all the other issues off the front page for 10 Rengar threads that are extremely redundant to begin with. They are disproportionately representing their concerns at the cost of silencing others. \n\nHonestly it feel pretty deceitful to try to misrepresent the opinion of the community. 500 people didnt upvote that thread, 500 Rengar mains did. It seems like a very dishonest way to express your opinion. \n\nAnyway, take it or leave it. Just be aware that the community isn&#039;t ACTUALLY in some crazy frenzy about Rengar.\n\nEDIT: Just to clarify it's not like I think Rengar players dont have a right to voice their opinions, but falsely creating this frenzy by upvoting so many threads isnt exactly a fair way of going about it. It would be nice if you limited it to a few threads instead of upvoting practically every single one. Even if they were spaced out it would be better rather than constantly kicking other discussions off the front page","replies":[{"poster":"Sakuri Ono","date":"2017-06-16T02:03:20.900+0000","up_votes":51,"down_votes":4,"body":"Hello everyone~! The timing of this topic actually couldn't be any better as the Warden program just released a whole bunch of us into the fray.\n\nThere should be a proper introduction thread soon, but for now I am 1/4th of your new Gameplay board specific Wardens and this particular issue is something we've had quite a few days of discussion about. Allow me just a tiny bit of banner raising to pin this comment so more people can see that plans are indeed in motion.\n\nAnd for all you TL;DR people, feel free to Control + F down to the \"Plan of the Week\"\n\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}} \n\nNow for the meat of things. Just _what_ can we do/want to do about high influx of subjects like 'Rengar' that, while obviously having a very strongly passionate community behind them, tend to bog down the boards in a lot of similar, low-impact, topic spam.\n\nFirst, we need to look at 'why' this tends to happen. Over time there's this general 'history' in the community, even going back to the days of the original Forum system, that in order to gain Riot's attention you need to be loud, boisterous, if not downright aggressive to get the coveted 'Red Post' confirming that your topic has indeed gotten attention. While, admittedly, this has worked in a few rare cases; we've noticed this has led to a more aggressive environment over time with less and less constructive-styled feedback popping up. In tandem with this, Riot posts have turned up less commonly as well.\n\nThen of course you have the side 'whys' like bandwagoning, 5 seconds-in-spotlight-ect.\n\nSo what can be done/what do we plan to do about it?\n\nWell, as they say in the old Western movies: _There's a new sheriff in town._\n\nNow, before we give off the wrong idea here, we're talked this through quite a bit and none of us want to take the 'purify by flames' approach at all. In fact just discouraging and/or deleting posts left, right, and center wound end badly for everyone. We're quite well studied on the 'Us vs the Mods' era back when Boards first began. Instead we'd like to try a few 'reward' systems on top of just simply enforcing the rules on a fundamental level. Here's the two biggest points of action we're focusing on right now.\n\n**\"Plan of the Week\"**\n\n_Megathreads_\n\nSo what 'is' a Megathread? A Megathread is a combination of, what normally is dozens of different ideas scattered across individual threads, all wrapped up into a singular post. With proper formatting (and a ToC list) people can quickly see if their point has been made, offer new points, content current points, ect. All in the comment's section of a single thread.\n\nWe would like to think this could have three great side effect for the community here as a whole.\n\n-Those who go to the effort to maintain Megathreads, on issues that come and go such as this Rengar moment, can potentially see their threads Pinned for maximum Riot visibility. We're still discussing the 'qualifications' for what hits this critical mass point, but be assured it is a hotbed issue in our minds at the moment.\n\n-With a pinned discussion, containing a LOT of constructive critique of an issue, we're hoping this will more positively encourage Rioters to have a spot to leave feedback on the issues you, the community, feel need some form of addressing.\n\n-Additionally, this incentive should help give people reasons to gravitate towards centralized threads; rather than spinning out as many clone-topics as possible.\n\n_Enforcement of the Universal Rules_\n\nNow, for the sake of clarity and sanity, we know that even the most Positive minded of solutions isn't going to be a 100% fix. People will still want to make their own topics (which is fine in and of itself!), people will still bandwagon. However, at least half of the current issue we and the community have with this can be addressed by applying the Universal Rules themselves. You will likely see these ones in particular enforced quite a bit in the near future.\n\n**Spamming / Trolling**\n   _-Posting designed to bait conversation or falsify content_\n   _-Making repetitive non-constructive or low effort content_\n   _-Bumping of discussions with no additional context_\n\nLet's be honest on both ends, there are quite a few posts containing merely a few lines, of things already more constructively covered in other threads or said purely just to anger people into replying. In recent history these have simply slid through due to being 'topic of the moment' relevant and Upvoted highly enough to stick around far longer than they should.\n\nAside from directly reported topics, these will likely be the ones most likely to be sealed up by us.\n\nTogether we're hoping these two approaches will help with quite a few of the issues you've brought up in this thread and discussion!\n\nPlease, if you have any feedback, questions, concerns fire away! The Wardens are all ears for things the Community would like to see happen as well; as we're going to do everything in our power to make our transition a two-way street.\n\nRegards~\n\n\nhttp://i1152.photobucket.com/albums/p495/SakuriOno/signature_zpsxvarnhru.jpg\n","replies":[{"poster":"macromite","date":"2017-06-16T04:43:41.939+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"was this intended as a comment, because it doesn't look like it belongs as a comment.","replies":[{"poster":"Sakuri Ono","date":"2017-06-16T05:39:05.661+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":2,"body":"Fully intended.\n\nWhen it comes to things like this the goal is more to add to community driven/originating discussions than simply 'make our own thread'.\n\nWardens are intended to foster community activity, not 'hijack' it through use of our own board powers. :3\n\nIf there's no such outlet available, we can and will make our own; but speaking personally I'd rather everyone feel they had an equal chance to be approached rather than having to come to us. \n\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}} ","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"LuxannaVeritas","date":"2017-06-16T05:03:17.493+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"BLESS\n\nCan't wait to see how these changes play out!

Its almost as though Shaco's early game is one of the most invade and oppression heavy jungle early on in the game. Its like he's got built in hard CC, decent slow, range, close range, splitpushing power, and good gank potential early on to offset his horrific lategame power by making sure he ends early.\n\nWHO WOULD'VE THOUGHT\n\nbut in all seriousness, dude, I get it, two key styles of playing shaco died, but they kind of had to die considering Shaco's winrate was ridiculously high even after being heavily nerfed multiple times. Hell, they gutted both builds and the clown still holds a 53% because of how ridiculously strong his early game ganks and mindgame ability is. He can force players to tilt and can guarantee an early win if he snowballs the right lanes like his ADC which the meta is so eccentric around right now.","replies":[{"poster":"Sun Wu Ryuumoku","date":"2017-06-15T23:19:23.308+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":">So, they removed assassination from Shaco \n\nNo, they didn't.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Tattersall","date":"2017-06-15T23:10:57.364+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah…  I thought it was weird when three of the posts that were on the top of the front page  were by people named Rengylvania, Rengar Rampage, and KnifeCat.","replies":[{"poster":"Marshbouy","date":"2017-06-15T23:42:57.790+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've also been seeing a huge influx of people with rengar related names to the boards.","replies":[{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2017-06-16T06:04:17.831+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"What, don't you trust a guy named Rengar Revert to be calm and rational about Rengar's rework?","replies":[{"poster":"Marshbouy","date":"2017-06-16T12:21:20.499+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm, I don't know why I wouldn't....","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Marshbouy","date":"2017-06-15T23:39:27.886+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm sick of people saying that rengar's Q was healthy and good for the game.
