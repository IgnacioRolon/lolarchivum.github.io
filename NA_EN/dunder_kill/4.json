Klepto pretty much injects Ezreal’s early game with steroids. You’re not just getting gold. You get so much more:\n\n-Even more gold (RNG gold sacks, which can be sold for 65g each).\n-Health and Mana pots (you know, those blue pots that got removed because they were broken).\n-Free wards and control wards (which don’t count against your ward total, meaning it’s even harder to gank the lane).\n-ELIXIRS (both old and new. I don’t even understand how this was considered a good idea in ANY CONTEXT. This literally means you are guaranteed to get free stats in lane).\n\nThis not only allows Ezreal to viably start without offensive items (I always start with mana crystal anyways, but this makes that start much easier), but it shoots the gold efficiency of ANY character with this mastery through the roof because you get free stats that your opponent can’t really deny unless they perfectly zone you out.\n\nI totally agree now that Klepto needs to either have a significantly reduced drop rate, or they need to take elixirs and other items that aren’t currently available to buy out of the drop roulette.","replies":[{"poster":"Spârky","date":"2017-11-21T13:31:24.510+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yea i see your point. Ive played it a few times i still am in the minority. I never feel like i am dominating the opposing laner ever. I really think its just a cool interaction that people are completely blowing out of proportion. Why do i think he has a high winrate. Because of those rng gold sacks that give way to much gold. every time i use one i normally get toward the upper end of the amount of gold given. That lets ezreal get his items much faster like normally when i first back with ezreal i get tear and maybe boots and a pot. But now I tend to (if i get a kill bot lane which normally happens) i get tear and sheen. After first back is supposed to be ezreals weakest point in laning and early game since he has to buy tear but since i can get sheen as well it bridges that time period where he is weakest allowing him to get to his power spike safer than before and stronger. \n\nMy solution: Either get rid of gold sacks or make it so that they just give you ~65 gold when you use them (their selling price) I think that would drastically solve this problem since you already get gold for hitting champions as well.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Flashes","date":"2017-11-18T04:17:20.579+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The problem is the coding.\n\nHow do you 50% proc a glacial gauntlet?","replies":[{"poster":"Flawless Fetus","date":"2017-11-18T04:30:48.177+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Half the size.
