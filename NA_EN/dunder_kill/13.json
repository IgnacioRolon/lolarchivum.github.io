Bugs are problems with the code.  A script can aid you in taking advantage of a bug.  However, there is no way Xerath Q (watch a replay when he succeeds in doing it the indicator for Xerath Q is about 2 pixels long, and not normal like when he messes it up) should hit the entire map when you stand in one particular spot and charge it for an exact amount of time.  Everything about it screams \"problem with code\" which he is using a script to reliably exploit said bug.\n\nEDIT: I'm also unaware of a script actually being able to alter how a spell works.","replies":[{"poster":"TheLastShadow45","date":"2017-04-11T18:48:43.013+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":7,"body":"Its a script 100%  the guy who made it has been selling it.","replies":[{"poster":"Hethalean","date":"2017-04-11T18:57:09.980+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Hethalean,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=NAdWUjz8,comment-id=0000000000000000,timestamp=2017-04-11T17:42:23.097+0000)\n>\n> A script can aid you in taking advantage of a bug.\n\n> EDIT: I&#x27;m also unaware of a script actually being able to alter how a spell works.\n\nSaying it's not a bug because a script is sold is similar saying dodging / hitting skill shots is impossible because someone sells scripts to do it.\n\nA few things if this is JUST a script and no bug behind it:\n1) Why must Xerath stand in a pretty precise location since it turns his Q into mostly global (no bot lane) aoe regardless of direction aimed?\n2) Why is the charge time on his Q so specific on how long to charge?\n3) Why when you watch one of the replays on youtube where they watch, the guy FAILS to do the exploit a couple of times (scripts failing??)?\n4) Why is there a circle telling you were to stand, and another circle telling you how far to charge his Q to? \n5) Why just Xerath?\n*following are questions assuming not a bug because the script is altering the physicality of spells in LoL*\n6) Why not make it hit bot lane?  The Tobias Fate game bot lane was entirely unaffected.\n7) Why is it not doing more damage?\n8) Why is it not doing Xerath W?\n\nHonorable mention:\nIf this is not a bug with Xerath Q, why is your client programmed in such a way that a script can alter the physical dimensions of spell effects in your game?  This would be a different bug in the client imo.\n\nAll of the above leads me to script exploiting bug.  Not stand alone script with no bug to exploit.","replies":[{"poster":"TheLastShadow45","date":"2017-04-11T19:17:22.286+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"dunder kill","date":"2017-04-11T19:38:14.521+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":1,"body":"***Its a script that is specifically made to exploit a bug***\n\nSecond, ***why are you posting a link to the script on the official Riot forums***\n\nAre you insane?","replies":[]},{"poster":"MissingKayo","date":"2017-04-11T19:20:09.619+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"You should probably remove that.
