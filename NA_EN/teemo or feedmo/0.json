A lot of the time I really can't talk about upcoming projects though so I feel like it's better not to give an unsatisfying response (eg. Necromancer Azir where? I knew we were working on it but couldn't share that information in case we had to cancel or radically change the project). Considering your question was pretty straightforward though I thought I may as well.\n\nIn general I can more easily talk about either past Skins or general Skin design stuff >:)","replies":[{"poster":"TerraRising","date":"2015-12-23T04:14:28.269+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Kindlejack,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=bPMVvEax,comment-id=000100010000,timestamp=2015-12-23T02:53:14.572+0000)\n> \n> In general I can more easily talk about either past Skins or general Skin design stuff >:)\n\nAlright... challenge accepted.\n\nBefore Yorick was put on the \"no new skins until rework\" list (a policy I find quite tiresome since it's been broken several times already), he was already released for an entire year.\n\nWhat _**really**_ stopped the skins team (or the entire company for that matter) from making and releasing a skin for him in that entire year (or 12 months... or 52 weeks... 365.25  days, or 8766 hours, if you will)?","replies":[{"poster":"Hello I am Bird","date":"2015-12-23T07:39:54.428+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"If I had to guess, it would be for the same reason {{champion:121}} hasn't gotten many skins.
