I could go to gamestop and spend 60$ on call of duty or whatever is popular right now, beat it in a day and play the same multiplayer over and over and over and the only change i will see is a DLC for 30$ with like 4 new maps whoo! \r\n\r\nRiot is always changing, always improving, always releasing new champions or skins or game-types or community events. I always look forward to seeing what new things are on the way or whats being changed for better or worse, because shit at least you're trying. You get involved with the community answering their questions, letting players play with employees, setting up fun ways for people to get involved, sharing community creations, and all around do an awesome job at what you do. The other day i saw a person post they made it to 1000 ranked wins and wanted to play with a riot employee to celebrate and you know what? A riot employee commented on that and said let's do it! That's so cool and riot is the only company connecting with their community like this.\r\n\r\nTL;DR You guys catch a lot of heat from the community about the small things they disagree with but i think you deserve a pat on the back rito, you done good. I've been playing since season 2  and to compare that game to the well-polished world renowned game it is today is astounding. You guys have come so far and will continue to do so and that's why i love riot as a company and league as a game. Keep up the good work, can't wait to see what season 6 has in store :D","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-10-23T20:41:05.931+0000","up_votes":52,"down_votes":2,"body":"Thank you for the kind words! <3","replies":[{"poster":"PixTron","date":"2015-10-24T04:47:27.546+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot KateyKhaos,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=odb06pEV,comment-id=000a,timestamp=2015-10-23T20:41:05.931+0000)\n>\n> Thank you for the kind words! <3\n\nJust a question, Khaos.\n\nIf Riot was forced to give Graves a Cigar or create a Sandbox mode.\n\nWhich would Riot most likely do?\n\n<3\n-Pixy. :D","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Boltrix","date":"2015-10-24T06:37:54.703+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"They'd likely troll you and give him a cigar made out of sand.","replies":[]},{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-10-26T16:42:40.018+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel like this is a trap. :P","replies":[]},{"poster":"Miss Luxanna","date":"2015-10-24T04:48:56.092+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"They'd give Graves a non-toxic Swedish electric cigarette","replies":[{"poster":"ChimeiTekinaNasu","date":"2015-10-28T00:13:18.526+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MadokaMagicaLux,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=odb06pEV,comment-id=000a00000000,timestamp=2015-10-24T04:48:56.092+0000)\n>\n\nWhat...
