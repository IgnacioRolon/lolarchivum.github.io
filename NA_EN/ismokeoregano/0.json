There is no bridge on SR, and I can say from personal experience having played ARAM since those days, it was never called Murderbridge back then.\n> Murderbridge was actually a nickname Howing Abyss got when it was on PBE (not sure if it was a nickname given by the devs or the community). The occasional easter egg \"Welcome to the Murderbridge!\" from the announcer was a throwback to that.\n\nDamn, inform yourself please before looking ignorant.\n\nARAM was played on the tutorial map and got changed when Lissandra got out. At the time, you had to play on custom games because there was no queue for ARAM and someone once said the joke : It's not ARAM, it's the murderbridge. Rioters loved the joke so much they used on the new announcer when they created the queue.

The Howling Abyss is essentially a skin of that map (with minor differences), and thus the name carried over to the Howling Abyss.
