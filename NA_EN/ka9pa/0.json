The hacker changed all the passwords including my email password, but apart from that nothing much. I already sent a ticket to Riot and it has been about 3 days now. I was wondering how long it usually takes for riot to help get my account back, and if it is at all possible for them to retrieve it? I am really nervous and honestly I hate having to play on this account because it's level 7 lol.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-20T16:49:42.498+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't be nervous, our account team may be able to help out and you'll be in good hands!
