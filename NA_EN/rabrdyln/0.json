I tried to disconnect so the whole team wouldn't lose lp so I did that. I tried fixing it with the resolution because it worked before but it didn't. multiple atempts and didn't work. My team probably lost and I hope that my whole team at about 4 clock at October 16th 2017 could just get that lp back. I didn't  know it was even broken and I feel like it wasn't fair to lose lp just because I didn't know how to fix this issue. I cant even come back to it anymore.
