It sucks in even worse to be able to play but have a really bad game because people are constantly disconnecting.\n\nIt's not fair on 9 other people to suffer because of your life circumstances.\n\nI don't know if this is possible for you, but you can buy some phone data and use the internet on that to avoid other people messing with it. Which is what I often do to play.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"UnknowRival","date":"2016-12-01T02:30:58.589+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I would keep the low priority timer, but with a sufficient number of completed matches, say 5 or so, will drop the level of extremity by one. ie. 20 minutes to 15. 15 to 10. etc. Until its 5, then have them complete 5-10 to get rid of it entirely.

Leaverbuster only lasts for 5 games with a 5 minute wait already... The only way you can get it up to 20 minutes with more than 10 games is if you continue to ignore it and play games while disconnecting.","replies":[{"poster":"UnknowRival","date":"2016-12-01T03:59:00.349+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Fongletto,realm=OCE,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=uW7YAhr7,comment-id=000200000000,timestamp=2016-12-01T02:44:09.485+0000)\n>\n> That is already how the system works.

It gave me another 20 minute timer instead of 15 or 10.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-01T01:01:45.265+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"*Low-priority queues* aren't intended to be a punishment as much as a *troubleshooting period* to figure out what's causing your disconnections.
