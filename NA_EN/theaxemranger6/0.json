I hadn't played LoL with this new update, but when I got into game, the game would instantly freeze and make a noise that resembles a glitch or an error. I can't move my mouse, my screen freezes and I cannot do anything to get out of the game.\r\n\r\nI can connect to the game perfectly fine, champion select is completely normal, and I even reinstalled LoL just to be safe. I restarted my laptop several times, and ran my virus protection program and nothing came up.\r\n\r\nAnother thing is that I can restart my laptop and get back into the game perfectly fine, but after several minutes it freezes up again.\r\n\r\nI don't know too much about laptops and computers, but I can deduct that there is something going on internally, but I'm not too sure about it. If you can give me insight on this issue, it would be very helpful and greatly appreciated, thanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-06T18:38:40.345+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The newest version of Windows 10 auto enabled the [Xbox Game Bar](http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8637-game-bar-turn-off-windows-10-a.html) and is causing freezing problems for some players.
