When I downloaded league on my tower, I had ZERO issues.\n\nNow, all the sudden, on this brand new laptop. I get Error 1935 and its  annoying. Wtf? I downloaded all my steam games just fine. I tried doing what I keep reading online and downloaded Windows C++ Redistributable  separate, but I get Error 1935 for that too! WTF!?!?!!?? How the heck am I suppose to get download LoL if I cant download the other crap required for LoL? Makes no sense. I am running Windows 10 64bit if that helps.
