When recovery an account, we ask that players fill out an [account recovery form](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=72416) specifically for that instead of a regular ticket.  The specialist may have locked your account to protect it, but you'll still need to fill out that form.  If you have and received a ticket number, let me know what it is.  I'll be happy to check it out!","replies":[]}]}
