After the loss, I tested my ping in a custom, which showed the regular 15, and proceeded to load into another ranked, and ran into the same problem again. I'm baffled as to why this is happening, and I have not experienced slower connection in any other application and games (Chrome, Overwatch, etc.). At this point I'm not going to start up another game, but I am still able to login and create custom games with low ping with no problems. Help would be greatly appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-01T20:38:18.377+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like your connection to that *specific* server could be encountering issues along the route it takes.

It only happens at night, but just like you it's in Ranked only. The last time it happened my ping was 250~, but the Normal game before and the Normal game after were at the regular 50~ ping. I tried checking my internet speed during the Ranked match, but it was fine.\n\nIt has been happening for about a week now, so I hope that it is something that can be fixed soon.
