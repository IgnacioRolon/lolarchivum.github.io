Not being able to use smite is a disadvantage for your team. Afterwards,  when you get close to lvl 20, you will be exposed to players that have filled rune pages.\n\nThe importance of wards is that they give you more vision of the enemy's whereabouts which allows you to make better decisions as to where you should go and do next. If you have no wards around the map and no vision of the enemy team, then you don't know where they are and every bush and fog of war area is a dangerous place.

Do it before you can handle bots easily, and you're more likely to attract harassment from inconsiderate players.  You definitely want to make the transition sooner than later, though.  PvP is a massively different environment, and you'll want to learn how to counter real people's plays.\n\nWards are for vision.  You know how when the enemy runs a little too far, you can't see them?  If they're in range of a ward, you'll still see them.  In bot games, they're almost worthless.  Against people, they're necessary.  Players go through the jungle to sneak up and kill you unexpectedly.  Placing wards in there will give you early warning and let you plan accordingly.  One thing you need to keep in mind is that the wards won't see through walls or into bushes.  To see into a bush, you need to put the ward directly into it.  It'll still provide coverage to any line-of-sight areas within its range outside of the bush.","replies":[]},{"poster":"hh the thinker","date":"2015-02-22T02:53:11.543+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"between level 10 to 15 I would say start normal. as for wards, they help prevent ambushes (ganks) and tell you where the other team is, which isn't useful vs bots, but is useful vs real players.","replies":[]}]}
