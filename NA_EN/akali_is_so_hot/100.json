And if you can't get off another auto to make up for the missed Q stack, you're down another .7, to a measly .4 AP ratio.

It has nothing to do with their argument.\n\nYes cc affects everyone but there are some champions that are hurt far more for it than others simply because of how you have to play to do anything. Master yi, has the same problem as Ekko, in this regard. When he wants to attack you have no choice but to facetank everything to just get close. Ekko, has a small dash but nowhere near the level of Zed, or Leblanc. his cooldowns are nowhere near as safe as those two.\n\nHis ult technically has a global range with teleport but it's silly to call it such. You have to tp into somewhere and get burst down instantly for it to have the range you're talking about in the way it would possibly be useful. You have to take a crapton of damage in about two seconds after the tp and not be cc'ed then ult away. It's just silly.\n\nHe is a safe champion but nowhere near as safe as he is being made out to be. His cc is hard to hit with anything more than a slow.  Hitting a stun is hard as hell. You have to predict sooooooooo damn much for it to even hit them then you gotta be close enough to pop it.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
