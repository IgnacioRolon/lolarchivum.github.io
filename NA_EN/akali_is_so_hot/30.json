Of course league isn't like Pokemon its a Moba after all, but if riot really wanted to they could go for 200 or even 300 champs even. But still that's a lot of champs that each are different in their own way and have their own unique skins, animations, kits, etc. I mean what really keeps lol so popular and fresh compared to other games really is that its constantly updating and bringing new things.
