The nerfs will hurt no doubt, but I don't think they'll be enough to stop her from being contested.\n\nIf they really want to kick her out they should just raise her Tremor Sense to every 3 seconds, make her ult not global at ranks 1 and 2, increase the on target cooldown for her W knockup, and make her tunnels decay way faster.
