Soraka's easy, you just blow her up. Lulu, you force her to ult herself so that she doesn't ult her ADC, then turn on the ADC. Janna, well....she's kind of a bitch(I swear to this day she caused those mountains to collapse herself), and Brand is pretty rough, but Soraka and Lulu have nothing on Rakan's level of CC, considering he can chain TWO CCs together extremely easily and dance between enemies and allies.

Lulu's a bit harder to deal with than Soraka, but I can still make her waste her ult on herself. Rakan just E's who I initiate on, R>W>Q's me, and then E's them again any time I try to attack anyone and I'm stuck standing there for about 3 seconds until the rest of his team catches up. It's rather hard to deal with a support who can stop you from doing the one thing you're supposed to do so well. They're usually extremely focused on saving that combo for me as well. And if the ADC is a Xayah, it just becomes even crazier because of her ult, and if she has flash, she can pretty much guarantee her E hitting me despite my attempts to dodge it. I miss when Xayah was less about her autos and more about her E....","replies":[{"poster":"Thefrostyviking","date":"2018-03-17T10:34:22.203+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah i guess i should account for champions played as well, but with what you wrote in mind your statement makes a lot of sense.\n\n\nBut i am fairly sure they haven't touched Xayah?

Her autos hurt too, but not near as much as now.

But I've been seeing it pretty early in their builds rather than later on. Generally in their first 3 items. The most used core on op.gg is ER>RFC>IE. It's hard to even comprehend the amount of damage from autos she gets out of that. When I played her I did well even without IE until like my last crit item, because of her E. Like I would never even build IE unless I was just ahead and wanted 100% crit because my E did so much damage and I usually had the attack speed and 40% CDR to pretty much just spam my E. Now it's like balls to the wall full damage on both autos and E with IE. I just wish they'd made her rely on her E much more for damage and safety so she didn't have so much of both and just use it as a panic button. It was much more fun to kill people with E and rely on spells than to just right click them down. But I guess that's the nature of ADCs.","replies":[{"poster":"Thefrostyviking","date":"2018-03-17T20:34:39.080+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah a difference of playstyle x)\n\nI always built her the korean way because i felt comfortable doing it having done it previously with Ashe.\n\nThat AA damage was much too good to pass up as a third item, and i wasnt surprised to see that the Koreans were of the same opinion in the end.\n\nAlmost every Xayah i can remember built like that as well, although there were a few oddballs that did rush IE or went BF-zeal item-IE.\n\n\nIt's just the most effective strategy since it has the best powercurve and gives her a good balance of safety and damage. \n\n\nWithout the auto damage enhancement you quickly find yourself sadly very irrelevant quite frequently  in the current meta, especially against tanks meant to endure damage from topclass marksmen.\n\n\n.....\n\nI still play crit MF though^^","replies":[{"poster":"VoraciousX","date":"2018-03-17T20:41:36.676+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Thefrostyviking,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=5i8LnB7a,comment-id=0002000000010000000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2018-03-17T20:34:39.080+0000)\n>\n> Ah a difference of playstyle x)\n> \n> I always built her the korean way because i felt comfortable doing it having done it previously with Ashe.\n> \n> That AA damage was much too good to pass up as a third item, and i wasnt surprised to see that the Koreans were of the same opinion in the end.\n> \n> Almost every Xayah i can remember built like that as well, although there were a few oddballs that did rush IE or went BF-zeal item-IE.\n> \n> \n> It&#x27;s just the most effective strategy since it has the best powercurve and gives her a good balance of safety and damage. \n> \n> \n> Without the auto damage enhancement you quickly find yourself sadly very irrelevant quite frequently  in the current meta, especially against tanks meant to endure damage from topclass marksmen.\n> \n> \n> .....\n> \n> I still play crit MF though^^\n\nI preferred ER>RFC>Shiv>Death's Dance and then whatever I needed afterwards.
