{"poster":"Akali is SO HOT","date":"2018-02-23T18:54:44.409+0000","title":"The free 5 damage against minions should probably come back","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":116,"down_votes":15,"body":"I've noticed that a lot of AP champs that I played had a somewhat difficult, but still doable time csing under turret pre patch.  After the patch I&#039;ve noticed that I&#039;ve been missing so much cs because the minions keep surviving the auto attacks with less than 5 hp.  It&#039;s not a problem for champs that build AD early on, but for a lot of AP champs (Leblanc, Ahri, Liss, etc.) this small change seems to be huge.\n\nThe reasoning in the patch notes was:\n>We were worried that the removal of old runes and masteries would make last-hitting too hard, so we gave all champion attacks a bonus 5 damage against lane minions. Over time, it&#039;s become clear this wasn&#039;t necessary, so we&#039;re reverting that change\n\nhttps://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-84-notes\n\nI&#039;m not really a fan of this reasoning because I thought it was a good change to help players get cs more easily.  Especially in the lower elos, where cs can be low as hell already to start with, it was a good change for players that have a harder time getting cs.  I&#039;m sure higher skilled players don&#039;t need the 5 damage as much, but I think the damage is huge for a lot of champs and especially for players that are less skilled at the game.  The change didn&#039;t seem to be hurting the game at all so I think taking out this mechanic was unnecessary.","replies":[{"poster":"Slythion","date":"2018-02-23T18:58:40.412+0000","up_votes":44,"down_votes":5,"body":"Playing Anivia for the first 2-3 waves feels really bad against anyone who has any form of push potential at all, that 5damage would mean *a lot* and I'd appreciate it if it came back as well","replies":[{"poster":"XLC","date":"2018-02-23T20:45:21.185+0000","up_votes":26,"down_votes":0,"body":"You mean you don't like having to auto attack melee minions twice after two tower hits to be able to kill them on a champ with an AA speed slower than paint drying?","replies":[{"poster":"Disulfiram","date":"2018-02-24T16:09:36.043+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're complaining for Anivia, but {{champion:9}} had to do that even before patch 8.4 ...","replies":[{"poster":"Slythion","date":"2018-02-25T02:21:53.302+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:30}} be like :^)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"GAMIAS EUNE","date":"2018-02-24T05:41:38.534+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Anivia before 6 should be punishable, and she alrdy has a revive passive.","replies":[{"poster":"Slythion","date":"2018-02-25T02:23:40.327+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're not wrong.
