Maybe the enemy only has to be standing in the little X he creates for him to get the reset even if he doesn&#039;t kill them?  If that&#039;s the case, then that&#039;s super dumb and should be removed imo.  Something like that is unintuitive and rewards him for missing his ult.\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/-mRYrf1vkmg?t=2612","replies":[]}
