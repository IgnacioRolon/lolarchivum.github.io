Not all of these game changing, meta warping, monstrosities like the last few champions have been.  I feel like ever since Riot created Bard all they&#039;ve wanted to do is introduce things to completely change how the game is played and it&#039;s starting to get a little annoying.","replies":[{"poster":"Jbels","date":"2016-09-25T00:29:38.589+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"The problem is, the champions who have simplistic kits suffer because there are very few meaningful choices to go with those simplistic kits. Galio brings practically nothing to the table besides his flash ult plays. His kit is a little TOO simple. That's not to say simplistic champions can't work,  Malphite has a simplistic kit, but his ult makes it worth taking.","replies":[{"poster":"Jaygo41","date":"2016-09-25T01:26:38.522+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"This.\nPeople don't realize that the lack of choices that a champion has to make does result in them being impossible to balance.

If Garen had a dash or other way to access the backline instead of simply popping ghost and hoping nobody stuns him, he'd probably be more useful in higher tiers. \n\nAnnie is pretty simple, but she's seen pro play as a stunbot support.","replies":[{"poster":"Jaygo41","date":"2016-09-25T03:15:50.798+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"VERY rarely do we see Annie in Pro Play, especially these days.

Those are dedicated Galio mains doing their thing. They're making the best out of that kit. As for Annie, Blitz, etc., their kits aren't balanced around being shitty for the sake of one game changing ability (Galio's ult). Their kits are well rounded and multifaceted. Not to mention each of them has a decent skill cap, whereas Galio's skill cap is reached as soon as you master Flash ulting","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Lovelle","date":"2016-09-25T14:14:27.826+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't mind simple kits.
