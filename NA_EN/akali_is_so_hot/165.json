By alternating sum it is meant that:\r\n1 = -1 + 2\r\n2 = -2 + 4\r\n3= 1 - 2 + 4\r\n4= -4 ++ 8\r\n5= 1 - 4 + 8\r\nand so on and so forth.\r\n\r\nNote: 5 = -1 - 2 +8 does not work because the signs are not alternating.\r\n\r\nCan every positive integer can be expressed this way?  If so then prove it.\r\n\r\nSome numbers might have more than one of these expressions for example 3= 1 -2 +4 and 3= -1 + 4.  Given a number n.  How many different ways are there to write n in this fashion?  Explain.\r\n\r\nGo nuts.","replies":[]}
