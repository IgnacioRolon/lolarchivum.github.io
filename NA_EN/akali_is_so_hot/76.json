E is about twice as spammable now and has more consistent damage output than his W (which doesn't give any damage once the shield breaks). So basically, yes, they made it so Nautilus has damage even once his shield breaks, just not as directly as everyone thought they would, and ultimately this will help out his early-mid game immensely by boosting his clear speed and DPS early while his shield is weak, where late game his shield scales hard enough to make him look to be a real powerhouse in team fights.

I have no need to offer a rebuttal; my original argument still stands, and is supported by players far more skilled and knowledgeable than you or I.  Tanky junglers cannot duel Lee Sin in the jungle.  Lee Sin, played intelligently, should be able to consistently three buff any of them without reprisal.  If he can counterjungle them, he can ward their jungle, and if he can ward their jungle, he can countergank, where he will offer far more impact than the tank jungler.  Yes, those junglers bring CC to the table, but that, on ganks, largely helps keep the enemy from running away.  If the enemy has no desire to run away, what do you do when the CC ends and they have more damage than you?\n\nI like tanky junglers, and would even argue they bring more to the table late game than Lee Sin does.  Lee can only ult, as good as that is.  Nautilus can grab, slow, ult, and generally be annoying throughout the whole fight.  Amumu played properly is game-changing late.
