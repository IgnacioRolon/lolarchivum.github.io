And let me tell you something that everyone seems to not know; His dash needs autos to cooldown fast enough to stack the resistances otherwise they wear off before it comes back up. \n\nIf you see him dashing around the minion wave, it probably isn't good to fight him there. If you see him dashing around your team in a fight, you should have focused the carry like always because even though he's a carry from the jungle, he's still a carry. People would focus a Jax or Xin Zhao if they came into a fight the way Graves does, and they're almost always tankier than him with either more health, or more resistances, or both, so let's not pretend he's an infallible tank unless we're letting him stack (emphasis on letting because you'd have to be losing a fight or focusing the wrong people for his passive to be stacked, or letting him do it in the minion wave)","replies":[{"poster":"Celestial Lion12","date":"2016-09-30T18:32:02.409+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"HOLY SHIT ACTUAL LOGIC AND REASONING WITH A WAY TO GIVE REAL COUNTERPLAY WHAT THE HELL IS THIS","replies":[{"poster":"Jet Sett","date":"2016-09-30T18:47:07.939+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like Graves, and I won't lie and say he isn't strong because otherwise he wouldn't get picked in the Worlds series like he was yesterday.

Nothing is healthy about his kit at all.\n\nI guess the biggest weakness he has compared to them is that any of the actual melee carries dunk on him in a 1v1 with very little effort late game, where Graves actually falls off. By comparison, every melee carry except for Tryndamere (who falls off by virtue of being unable to team fight in any real capacity late game, he's still an extremely powerful duelist late game) and to an extent Riven have quite strong late games when they aren't just dog shit in general (so like Yi is now). \n\nAlso, why even mention his laning phase? It's strong, but not any more than someone like Darius' is into many of the same match-ups, and top lane Graves is not an issue in high elo.
