{"poster":"Akali is SO HOT","date":"2018-07-16T16:55:26.911+0000","title":"Unpopular Opinion: CertainlyT has really revolutionized this game with his work","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":30,"down_votes":33,"body":"For all the shit people give him, what he has done with his creations has done a lot of good for the game.  I've talked to some Rioters about this and they completely agree.  The first great example I can give is Thresh.  Look at every support before Thresh.  You should notice that all of those champions were either shield/heal bots or CC bots.  Thresh was the first support that brought something to the table that wasn't just generic shielding and healing or CCing the enemy team forever.  If Thresh had not been made, then Tahm Kench, Rakan, and Pyke, who are all super fun and popular (Tahm to a lesser extent), would most definitely not exist.  Thresh showed us and Riot that supports could do more than just sit back and spam shields/heals or go in and CC the enemy forever.  Remember that Thresh was released all the way back in Season 3.  To do something as crazy as that so early in League's life is absolutely amazing.  Look where we are now.  Supports went from ward bots who nobody ever wanted to play to fun and exciting champions that have access to so many cool items and things to do.  If you are a Tahm, Rakan, or Pyke main, then you have CertainlyT to thank for that.\n\nNext up is Yasuo.  People can hate on Yasuo all they want, but he has inspired countless other designers to make champions with incredibly unique abilities that bring cool things to the table.  If we look back at release order we have Aatrox, follwed by Lucian, then Jinx, and then Yasuo.  In just a few champions we went from one of the absolute worst champions ever created to Yasuo.  Before Yasuo, most melee champions just had a generic dash with some other abilities that could really be on any other champion.  Take old Fiora for example.  Her Q gave her 2 dashes, her W let her dodge 1 auto attack, her E was just a generic Attack Speed buff, and her passive was just a lame ass heal that nobody ever noticed.  Her old ult was super lit, but that's all she really had.  Yasuo brought everything crazy to the table.  Tons of dashes, Windwall, a Q that did multiple different things, double crit chance, and an ultimate that was insanely fun to use and could synergize insanely well with team comps.  There is a clear difference between champions made before Yasuo and champions made after Yasuo.  Most champs before him didn't bring anything special to the table, but every single champion after has brought something out of left field to League.  If you enjoy playing champions like Azir, Ekko, Kled, Camille, and Kayn, then you have CertainlyT to thank for it.\n\nAlthough completely and utterly failed, the Morde rework put non marksman bot laners on the radar for Riot.  Nobody really talked about bringing non marksman bot lane before this (mostly just nerf X ADC so a different one can take their place), but now look where we are.  We got things like Heimer and Darius bot and a ton of mages too.  It was a tricky thing to do and it took quite a while, but we are finally in a place where more than just ADCs can successfully go bot lane.  You have CertainlyT to thank for that.\n\nNot to even mention the Warwick rework which is one of the best reworks of all time.  **I'm not gonna try to deny that he has made some pretty big mistakes with champion kits that he has worked with in his career**, but I can confirm that we would not have all of these amazing champions that we have today without him.  This dude was doing 2017 and 2018 stuff in 2013.\n\nThis probably isn't the best time to post this considering people are probably freaking out about how busted and cancer new Akali will be and what not, but I'm posting this anyway.","replies":[{"poster":"DoktorKaiser","date":"2018-07-16T17:28:54.195+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":1,"body":"He brought unique stuff, but for the sake of game balance and that in my book is a colossal mistake. His designs single handedly ruined league in my honest opinion, not just because they are extremely unfun to play against (my best friend quit after 6 months because he couldn't handle Yasuo as a champion in every single game),   but because almost all of his champions are impossible to ever balance properly.  I mean you can have \"boring champions\"  like Rammus, Mundo and shit   and have a somewhat balanced game with fun interactive gameplay, or you can have flashy cancers like Yasuo, Zoe, new Irelia   and have a terrible game that made a lot of people , myself included, quit after 7+ fucking years.

Introducing Douchebag, the Resourceless Mistake\n\nPassive 1: \"Oops Shield\" -  Douchebag gains a shield (maximum of 50 +.4 AD% health) for taking damage over 5 seconds. When the shield breaks, Douchebag gains a 35% movement speed buff and ignores minion collision.  \n\nPassive 2: Spammer - After killing a minion, Douchebag's abilities have a 20% refresh rate.\n\nQ: Woosh Woosh: Douchebag can launch a lightning bolt that passes through terrain and barriers, inflicting % max health true damage with increased damage to low health targets.\n\nW: Oops Heal - Douchebag doesn't know to strategize, so when he takes lethal damage, he immediately gains 50% health. Can also be activated. \n\nE: Crazi Boi Dashin - (no CD btw cuz lolzies) Douchebag dashes forward in lane at a maximum of 800 units gaining a stacking attack speed buff (max 70%) for every unit damaged, applying stacking armor penetration.  This can also go through terrain and over walls.\n\nR: #LCSBigPlays - Douchebag gains (20/30/45) increase to his base stats, can attack 200 units farther away, has (150/300/450) increased health, and dubstep blasts your opponents eardrums as Douchebag flies 50 feet in the air, dabs, and instantly kills anything in a 2000 unit area.  Causes the Live Gameplay team to immediately cream themselves whenever used in a professional game. \n\nThere, it took me just a few minutes to draft this fun and unique design.
