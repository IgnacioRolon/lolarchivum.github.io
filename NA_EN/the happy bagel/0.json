If it's happening enough to give you 20 minute LPQ, then you really need to do something on your end. You can control this.","replies":[{"poster":"Charmorg","date":"2017-07-11T02:43:05.676+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Literally everyone else suffers at least 5, possibly up to 10 minutes of wasted time every time you force a remake OP. As Silent Gravity says, figure out what's causing it and fix it, or don't play games where you tie up other peoples' time for 10 minutes.\n\nJust as an aside, 10 minutes of time, for 9 people, at **minimum** wage is over $10 dollars. At normal college graduate wage, it's well over $25. Would you prefer Riot made you pay for the peoples' time you wasted?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TrulyBland","date":"2017-07-11T00:18:50.137+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">If no one else suffered because it was a remake\n\nWell, if the time nine people spent waiting in queue, champion select, loading screen and in game are negligible, then your 20 minutes should be even less off an issue. After all even the absolute very best case scenario means that your dc wasted over 27 minutes.","replies":[{"poster":"FuhrerRico","date":"2017-07-11T00:21:13.725+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's about intentionality and negligence.

He did not even think long enough about the other people in the game to realize that he cumulatively wasted more than twenty minutes of their time.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"FuhrerRico","date":"2017-07-11T00:20:02.508+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually, I agree man.
