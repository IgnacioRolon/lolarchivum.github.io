Didn't work, so I thought I would re-install the client.  Now whenever i click on the client after installing to download the rest of the game, it just gives me the \"pvp.net patcher kernel has stopped working\" error and closes.  Any help?\r\n\r\nThanks","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-27T02:42:04.192+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like your PC may not be launching League with the right administrative privileges.
