If I CMD+Tab out of the game and then tab back in the video freezes but the sound continues to work just fine with no issues. I can continue to tab in and out but still having the same issue (sound continues to run). I did a little testing and this only happens if using the new discrete graphics card (AMD 460). If I force it to use the integrated graphics card (Intel HD 530, forced through gfx status app) the issue does not happen (although this is not ideal as the discrete graphics has much better performance of course).\n\nAlso quite interested this only happens in full screen mode, not windowed or borderless. Any thoughts guys or anyone else with the new late 2016 Mbook pro that can also test?\n\nThanks guys!\n\nSpecs: MacBook Pro 15 w/ TB. 2.9ghz i7 and the AMD 460 /Intel HD 530, 16Gbs Ram.\nNote: Everything worked just fine with old Late 2013 Mbook Pro with Nvidia discrete graphics.\nAlso This is first time posting and wasn't sure if this was more for report a bug or help and support. So apologize ahead of time if I was wrong.","replies":[{"poster":"FeelingSohSoh","date":"2017-01-29T04:06:15.818+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm receiving a similar issue, but with one additional problem since the last patch. While playing, randomly after clicking any key, even ctrl, the screen freezes and the audio continues. I can proceed to issue commands, such as move or a skill, and I can hear the audio continue on. I will alt tab then bring back up the game screen and everything will work again for a small amount of time. This can happen every 20 seconds or every 10 minutes, it seems to be random. \n\nThis was done with the worst and best graphics settings in game, Radeon 450 enabled.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-30T02:52:38.895+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow!
