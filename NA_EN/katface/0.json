However, it gets really frustrating when someone intentionally puts themselves in a position that attracts the sleeze of society and then uses that one freaking example to say there is this massive problem with a certain group (in this case male gamers.)\n\nThis would be equivalent to me going to a really bad neighborhood wearing a Rolex, flashing tons of cash, walking through dark alleys by myself and then making a comment that \"all black people are thugs\" if I wind up getting mugged by a black person. The truth is that over 99.9% for black people are law abiding citizens but by MY ACTIONS I attracted that 0.1% that isnt. Did I deserve to get mugged? Hell no. However, I think you would be perfectly in the right asking me \"well what did you think was going to happen?\"\n\nThis is essentially a case of confirmation bias. If you do things that attract bad people don't be suprised when something bad happens. 99.9% of guys would never even think to ask a random stranger for nude photos. However, when you do stuff like say \"give me free stuff\" you are going to naturally attract disgusting individuals looking for a \"trade.\"\n\nI am disgusted that some guy asked her for nudes. However, I'm equally disgusted that because of this experience she applied that negative stereotype to a large majority, if not all, male gamers. I'm sick and tired of girls blaming men and treating men different because of the minority of asshole guys out there. That is the very definition of discrimination; treating someone negatively because you had negative experiences with another member of that group.\n\nIt gets really disturbing how much of a double standard their is. I've never cat called a girl in my entire life but I've gotten cat called tons of times by girls telling me how my ass looks good or asking what my number is (usually when I'm in uniform.) When I tell other girls about this they ALWAYS say \"oh, they were just joking, it's not a big deal.\" But if a guy does it to one of their girl friends they're like \"oh my God I'm so sorry are you ok?\" Why is one a joke and one sexual harrassment?","replies":[{"poster":"TrulyBland","date":"2016-11-08T17:47:20.782+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've seen posts on the forums that did exactly what you say, so I see where you're coming from.\nBut OP didn't actually extrapolate from that one incident.

Her poll was even gender biased. What about guys who have been sexually harassed? Oh that's right, feminists believe that's guys can't be sexually harassed by women. I guess we just must be \"asking for it.\"\n\nThe sheer fact that she made a post about it after a single incident indicates she's thinks it's a widespread problem. You don't see gay guys or racial minorities making posts after a SINGLE person treats them disrespectfully. Most logical people understand that there are assholes out there and you can't take them too seriously.  I can understand bringing up the topic if you notice it happening it over and over but to take the time to make a post after a single incident shows some pretty severe bias.

Look at the freaking census before you say blatantly false things like that. \n\nSecondly, whether you are a minority or a majority it doesn't change what is and what is not discrimination.  That is a straw man argument designed by bigots to justify their hatred of white males. It is no more valid than white supremists claiming their are the \"pure race\" and therefore they are justified in their bigotry to minorities. Discrimination is discrimination no matter who is the perpetrator and who is the victim.\n\nI agree with you the feminists should strive for equality and that perhaps was the original intent. However, a lot of the movement has been hijacked by some very radicalized and hateful people. I don't see feminists fighting for equality unless that equality favors them. For example, men are required to sign up for the draft and if they don't they can be denied federal aid, denied a job, fined hundred of thousands of dollars or even inprisioned. Women are not required to sign  up for the draft. Where is the equality in that? Aren't women just as capable as men at fighting our wars? Where is the outcry that male rights are continent on their pledge to fight for our country while women's rights are not. There is no outcry because the practice favors women and therefore the feminist groups feel justified in having that inequality because men have \"so many other priviliages.\" It's hypocritical. Either you support equality in all ways or you dont. You can't pick and choose when you want to be equal to men.","replies":[{"poster":"dimorphium","date":"2016-11-08T20:48:14.892+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As soon as someone makes it more than being equal, it's no longer feminism.

We live in a patriarchy. The world is run by wealthy white males, whether you want to admit it or not. The outcome of the same actions by either party are drastically different, and it is for that reason that sexism against men isn't taken very seriously.\n\nWhen I say minority I'm not referring directly to population size, rather a target group. How exactly have you as an educated white male (I'm assuming, yes I just assumed your gender) been directly discriminated against? To say that men face the same discrimination as women is absolutely laughable. And sorry, I'm not from the United States. No one here has to be drafted. That is reverse sexism in the way that women are not considered to be fit to fight, and serve a better purpose at home. THAT is sexism. Nobody should be obligated.\n\nAnd by the way, for the longest time, even if a woman wanted to, she would not be allowed to enter the military in a combat role 100% because of her gender, and nothing else. Not drafting women is not sexist towards men. It is sexist towards women, implying that they are incapable of performing the same task.

The outcome of the same actions by either party are drastically different, and it is for that reason that sexism against men isn&#x27;t taken very seriously.\n> \n> When I say minority I&#x27;m not referring directly to population size, rather a target group. How exactly have you as an educated white male (I&#x27;m assuming, yes I just assumed your gender) been directly discriminated against? To say that men face the same discrimination as women is absolutely laughable. And sorry, I&#x27;m not from the United States. No one here has to be drafted. That is reverse sexism in the way that women are not considered to be fit to fight, and serve a better purpose at home. THAT is sexism. Nobody should be obligated.\n> \n> And by the way, for the longest time, even if a woman wanted to, she would not be allowed to enter the military in a combat role 100% because of her gender, and nothing else. Not drafting women is not sexist towards men. It is sexist towards women, implying that they are incapable of performing the same task. Talk to the men in charge and see why they choose to only draft men.\n\nNo feminist is ever going to identify themselves as a misandrist even if they engage in discrimination against men.  That's the issue, many women who call themselves feminists aren't feminists.  They don't seek equality, they seek women being superior to men and they trivialize male issues whenever they can.\n\nYou cannot know if a sexist comment effects a woman more than a man.  That in of itself is a sexist comment.  Its simply impossible to know because we can't be both a man and a woman at the same time.  You also can't make blanket statements like that about men and women without appearing very sexist.  There might be men who are extremely sensitive to sexual remarks because they were raped by a child.  There might be women who aren't affected by it at all because they grew up more tough skinned.  Just because the world is run by wealthy white males doesn't mean that we aren't affected by the same insecurities and emotions as women.  Its a complete non sequitur to say that.  Furthermore, its just a straight BS argument.  If we were a matriarchy would that make sexism toward women OK?  Hell no.  People shouldn't be discriminated against.  Period.  Doesn't matter who they are.  Doesn't matter what type of society they are in.  \n\nI'm going to show you how absurd your argument it.  You say that I can't be discriminated against in the US because its a white, male dominated culture.  What about if I was in Japan?  That's an Asian dominated culture.  If I was a white male there (making me a minority) would suddenly racists remarks against me be discrimination?  What if I was with a black guy in Japan and I made a racist remark to him?  Would it be OK since we are both minorities in Japan?  Would that mean I could make racist remarks to Asians in Japan but they couldn't make racist remarks to me?\n\nYou can see how absurd that all sound.  Racism, sexism, or any other form of discrimination is not dependent upon what race or gender dominates that culture.  Discrimination and bigotry are wrong no matter who is the perpetrator or who is the victim.\n\nTo say that a woman knows the discrimination a man goes through is laughable because they aren't men.  They have no idea what we go through.  I would NEVER try to make a comment like that about a woman because I'm not stupid enough to think I actually know what its like to be a woman.  I don't know why women feel like they can comment on how men should feel or act but \"how dare a man tell me how to feel or act.\"  \n\nGrowing up I've seen so many more men screwed by our society and discriminated against than women.  Even though more women receive bachelors, masters and doctoral degrees than men it is completely unacceptable to have a male only scholarship but it is perfectly acceptable to have a female only scholarship.  If a man is falsely accused of rape a woman faces no criminal charges, even though a false accusation can literally ruin a mans life.  If a woman rapes a child she is less likely to be convicted and typically receives a less harsh punishment than a man who rapes a child.  Hell, there are even some feminist groups who want to change the law so it is impossible for women to be charged with rape.  If a woman attacks a man she is less likely to be charged with assault, even if she has a deadly weapon like a knife.  If a woman rapes a man (even if he is underage) and the woman gets pregnant the man is still required to pay child support.  If a woman purposely sabotages contraception (i.e. sticking a needle through a condom) and she get's pregnant the man is still required to pay child support.  If a woman cheats on a man (even multiple times) and they get a divorce the woman is still overwhelmingly likely to get full custody of children (thus continuing to torment him by restricting access to his children even after she betrayed him.)  Men are 11 times more likely to die on the job than women, even though women make up 47% of the work force.  Men are 5 times more likely to commit suicide but are chastised by both men and women if they show any emotion besides aggression, even after a traumatic event.  Men who are in abusive relationships are often turned away from shelters when they try to get away from their abusers because many women don't think men can be abused.  One in six men are survivors of sexual abuse yet support for male sexual abuse is non-existent when compared to female sexual abuse.  There are a lot of men and women who even think that male sexual abuse is funny or that if a man is sexually abused he deserved it.  Research into woman specific diseases (i.e. breast cancer) receives vastly more funding per diagnosis and per death compared to male specific diseases (i.e. prostate cancer.)  The list goes on and on but I think I made my point.  Women are hardly alone in the challenges or discrimination they face.  I am not trying to say that women don't face discrimination.  They face a shit ton of discrimination and it disgusts me.  However, its really hypocritical to trivialize male discrimination and male struggles and say that you are for \"equality.\"\n\nThe draft issue isn't sexism against women.  Women have a CHOICE to serve in the armed forces in a time of war.  Men are FORCED.  Men can have their rights restricted if they don't sign up for the draft.  Women cannot.  When feminist groups fought for more gender equality in the military (a fight that I supported and was very vocal about) they refused to address the issue of the draft because they knew it was something that favored them.  Drafts are not good things.  Its conscription against a person's will.  The fact that only men have to sign up is not something that favors men, its something that favors women.  And when I bring this issue up with feminists they poo poo it and dismiss the topic because even though they know its unequal its not a priority because its something they benefit from.  I've never heard of a feminist who is outraged that she doesn't have to sign up for the draft lol.\n\nDo you know why women weren't allowed in combat roles?  I'll tell you the truth because I'm in the military and I was privy to a lot of the internal discussions that happened before the change was made.  Yes there were concerns that women didn't have the same upper body strength as men but that was pretty quickly dismissed as a legitimate reason because we can test physical strength and clear women who are strong enough.  There also was a major issue where the army and marines did studies where they put women in combat units for training exercises and then had those women get simulated shot during the training fire fights.  What they found is that the men were more likely to do unreasonably risky things to save an injured female soldier when compared to saving a male soldier.  The reasoning behind this is primarily for reasons of species survival that is so deeply ingrained in our psyche that it is extremely difficult to ignore.  Put bluntly, females are more valuable for the survival of a species because the number of females drives how fast a species can reproduce.  However, this argument was also dismissed because it could be mitigated with increased training and proper management at the staff sergeant and officer level.  The real reason why the military was so hesitant to let women in combat units is because the death of a woman soldier is much bigger news than the death of a male soldier.  The military was worried that if they allowed women in combat units than it would cause public opinion to shift against wars much quicker.  It was primarily a PR decision.  A news report can flash across the screen saying 10 men were killed in Afghanistan and no one bats an eye (even if they are fathers.)  But if a news report flashes across the screen saying a woman soldier was killed in Afghanistan then its a huge deal (even more so if she was a mother.)  I don't know why that is because I think the life of a man is just as valuable as the life of a woman but that's the truth of it.  Men were considered more expendable in the eyes of the military.\n\nI am all for equality but we have to be honest with ourselves if we are going to achieve it.  Women are equal to men.  That means that men have a lot of the same issues as women.  In some cases they aren't as severe and in some cases they are more severe.  We should acknowledge that and embrace men who struggle rather than chastise them and trivialize their issues.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Katface","date":"2016-11-08T23:52:20.411+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I just didn't want men who are here to argue to derail my post asking for replies from female players. it hasn't been the first time i've encountered sexism in the game, but it was the most shocking to me.
