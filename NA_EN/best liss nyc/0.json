I kept saying 'fragile mentality' to Irelia \n\nCurse words do not make or break toxicity. You can be toxic to someone *without* swears, as evidenced by your very chat logs. Harassing, insulting, and berating other players are **all** toxic, and will be handled accordingly.\n\n> yet I got a 14 day suspension.\n\nYes. Because that was the next step up on the punishment escalation. You had 2 chat restrictions before this ban, both of which warned you that continued behavior of a similar kind would cause you to be banned (and as a warning, your reform card for this ban will have told you that *any* instance of validated toxicity following your 14 day ban will cause a permanent suspension).\n\n> Do you have to be a good Catholic boy to play this game to not get punished?\n\nYou don't have to be perfect. You just have to be a decent person. Don't insult your teammates. It's literally that simple.\n\n> You can't even show your frustration anymore?\n\nIf that's what it takes for you to not harass other players, then that's the action to take.\n\nYou can be frustrated, even outright angry --- just keep it out of the game if you can't be nice.\n\n\n___\n\nI have removed the second link in your post, as it violated the guideline against Naming and Shaming in the [**Boards Universal Rules**](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/community-moderation/ITFIpNUE).\n\nIf you have any questions about this moderation action, don't hesitate to reach out to the Boards Moderation Team via:\n\n* The [**NA Boards Discord**](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/community-moderation/7rtKBZLi-boards-moderation-discord-verification)\n* The [**Discuss the Boards**](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/community-moderation) sub-board","replies":[{"poster":"Best Liss NYC","date":"2019-07-11T20:53:53.709+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"Oops sorry I forgot about the name thing, wasn't intentional\nBut yes, it's just ridiculous how something like this is 14 days worthy.
