I for one love when I report people for being toxic and racist in the chat yelling racial slurrs, and afk's don't even get me started. Riot does absolutely nothing in my experience with reporting when people are actually toxic and or greifing. Their busted report system is so bad in my opinion, my team and I could report one toxic player all of us the same thing and if he was yelling racial slurrs and greifing, inting etc... THEY DON'T BAN THEM. Riot only issues penalty's to people trying to get people to play the game properly and it's pretty much such a struggle to get out of bronze on this account cause I did my placements when I was really really trash. Everytime I play ranked I get inters, Feeders, Greifers etc... what has this game come to.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-28T03:32:19.399+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I went ahead and looked into those chat logs to see what might have been flagged. While it does look like you were simply trying to help your team and getting frustrated in the the process, some of the things that were said could have been seen rather negatively.
