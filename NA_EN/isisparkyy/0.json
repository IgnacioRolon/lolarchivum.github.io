Not to mention most of the things in DotA are just outright better. The afk system, phenomenal. Toxicity? Not as prevalent as it is in League. Trolls? Even if you have a troll you can still win. Want to play a new Hero? Sure, no cost, don't have to spend hours grinding for in game currency so you can play them. Want to play this Hero in this meta? Go ahead, no one will call you a troll because ALL of the Heroes in DotA are strong in their own regard. Sure, DotA is harder to play, the community is slightly smaller, and it has some awkward mechanics to it, but I think as a MOBA, DotA just simply outclasses League of Legends. I believe the SOLE reason DotA does not have a larger player base is because it:\r\n1. Does not have a huge and popular professional scene like LC$.\r\n2. Takes a long time to get used to and grasp certain mechanical aspects.\r\n3. Requires more effort to play the game comfortably (I.E. you must focus more in order to play efficiently).\r\n\r\nThe reason I still play League at all is because I've invested so much into the game, it feels like a waste to just quit. The community is pathetically toxic, from what I understand, drop hacking and scripting is starting to become a thing, the company (Riot) seems to be oblivious to the things that go on in their game, and the lack of other things to do in the game aside from play ARAM or Summoner's Rift makes the game boring at times (please bring back URF). While, yes, it can be difficult to create a whole new map/game mode from scratch, I think that eventually, this game will be overtaken by DotA, which makes me sad, because this game is a really great game. I honestly cannot say that the game itself is bad by any means. What makes this bad is the community, and the lack of effort on Riot's side to fix re-occurring issues in the game such as log in issues, lag and server crashes, east coast disadvantage, buggy client, in game bugs, and so forth.\r\n\r\nRiot could start by actually working on a REAL client for the game. Not a pop up window that is slow, glitchy, and irritating to look at. DotA has a full scale client. I will acknowledge that Riot has been making a \"decent\" effort at trying to equalize the playing ground between west coast and east coast, but as it stands right now, I am still dissatisfied with the results (lack of updates, no time frames, nothing).\r\n\r\nTL;DR\r\nDotA is growing faster than League, outclassing League in certain aspects, and Riot is sitting back and counting their money with each new Skin release (not to say I don't like the skins!)","replies":[]}
