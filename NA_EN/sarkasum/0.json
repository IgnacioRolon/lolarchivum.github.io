And obviously the second guy and some unrelated person decided to troll. Dodged it, but that is not the point of my complaint. The point is that this game is plagued with mass toxicity in lower elo and sometimes in higher as well. Is there nothing to be done about that? Would be great if someone actually did something about this, because it is impossible to report someone out of aftergame screen and even if there was i doubt that Riot would have the &quot;time or resourses&quot; to be checking every report. I do understand that but it is never the less annoying to be struck with the leaver buster because of someone else...{{summoner:1}}","replies":[{"poster":"Warwick Main","date":"2018-01-12T15:09:02.496+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, do not dodge. You take the lp loss if its ranked but report them in post game lobby. Make sure to note the player was trolling in champ select so they check pregame lobby logs.\n\nAs for the dude banning out a teammates pick, that's not against the rules.","replies":[{"poster":"DroppingTheRice","date":"2018-01-13T10:44:28.247+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yea man id rather lose 23 lp and mmr than 3 lp and no mmr just so i can report him lol!!!!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Broken Bandle","date":"2018-01-14T04:55:42.620+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are champs that I'm just not letting into the game. If we don't have first pick, I'm banning my champion of choice 100% of the time to make sure that my own personal win conditions are met. It's been confirmed on the boards dozens of times that you cannot receive punishment for banning whatever you want. ( And that the others could play any champ they wanted in reply. Those \"troll picks\" wouldn't even be considered punishable, either.)\n\nIf it's such a big problem, don't hover your champion. Then when I ban it out from under you, you can know that I did it for me and not to punch you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"La Belle Sauvage","date":"2018-01-12T18:02:30.558+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"I feel that we shouldn't be able to ban our teams pick if they have them selected. You should be free to ban who you want so long as it's not selected by your team. \n\nAnd if you don't select a champ and the chap you wanted to pick is banned then it's on that person for not selecting.","replies":[]}]}
