I then tried to load into an ARAM and rather then a background it was just black. The que popped and I accepted the game, I was not able to see any of the champions or skins or anything. I clicked my mastery page to edit it, but all my mastery pages were gone and I can not see the masteries or edit them in any way. So to be clear, I have no idea who I am playing and even if I did I can't change my runes or masteries. I ended up que dodging because it was such a mess.\r\n\r\nNext I opened the client again and tried to go to the Legacy client, I opened it and logged in, but this one just stayed a black screen once I was in. So to be clear, I was actually in the client, just it was all black and I couldn't do anything.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-17T05:14:22.331+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you may want to run a quick repair of the client in case this is caused by a lot of missing assets.

I'd recommend completely reinstalling League by using our [Hextech Repair Tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367) in order to resolve this. Simply open the app, then check the boxes for *Reinstall* and *Clean uninstall*, then hit Start. After the process has completed, launch League in order to complete patching and to initiate the Beta Client upgrade.\n\nLet me know the results.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
