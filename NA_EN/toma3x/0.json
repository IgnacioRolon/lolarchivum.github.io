In order for Ekko to use his clone thing properly he must know exactly where he was 4 seconds ago (and to compound that he has to accurately predict where his enemy shall be in 4 seconds, the difficulty of which varies on a case by case basis).  Keeping track of the clone is difficult in combat, and is actually quite difficult to properly use in a true teamfight for Ekko because he has to predict his clones positioning relative to his enemies.  Now it is easier for him because he has practiced but that doesn't change the fact that if his enemy also pays attention to where his clone is, then his clones power is drastically reduced (in a way that is very similar to {{champion:61}} and her ball in that respect).","replies":[{"poster":"Silents429","date":"2015-05-30T15:11:04.384+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know how he works but he needs massive clarity issues resolved, the fact he can hop around makes it even more difficult to really focus on things in a fight without randomly everyone being blown up.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Durzaka","date":"2015-05-29T19:55:29.875+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"Agreed.
