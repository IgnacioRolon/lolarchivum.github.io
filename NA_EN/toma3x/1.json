It's like the place olaf was put into which gave rise to the term \"don't OLAF the champion.\" If you really think that having a \"pubstomp\" hero that is only viable to pubstomp is cool, then Blizzard is no better than Riot. Remember Darius? Remember pre-rework Xin Zhao? Yeah they were \"pubstompers\" since they only worked against \"pubs\" who didn't know how to counter them and or didn't get to abuse them with a counter pick. If you are really in favor of champions that have been thrown into simply a \"pubstomp\" role when there is less than 50 heroes, how is HotS going to work with 50, 75, or even 100 heroes? \n\nAlso, you failed to look at their track-record for balancing their games. I won't simply judge a company on a game barely out of beta for competitiveness and balance. However, the problems stated about WoW their largest game and the one they put the most time, money, and balance people into still has obvious balance problems and it's been out for 10 years. I mean if you are really happy with that track record it's kind of sad. If you have ever been over on the HotS forum or put some games in you'd see that not only do that have \"balance issues\" with simply the heroes their MMR system is completely and utterly trash. Almost every day there are people complaining about being with and or against players who are over 5-10 levels or multiple ranks (in the ranked system) on their teams. So, even from a simple competitiveness standpoint, their system seems to think it's ok to put bronze people vs golds or even plats (their system is different I know, but the difference is still the same)... \n\ntl;dr: Blizzard has a track-record of having multiple balance issues and their MOBA is suffering some very basic problems that they should have fixed by now or they are YEARS behind every other MOBA on the market.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"AngelSpite","date":"2015-07-09T20:48:59.640+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":2,"body":"Evelynn too and runeglaive no longer changes the attack into magic.

I would also add Fiora to the list.\n\nYasuo gets that AA/spell blocking shield that is granted by movement.  He's a melee ADC with free ranged harass (only gated by cooldown).  His ultimate teleports him to any target in range that gets knocked up, and he does insane damage to them, while increasing the duration of said knock up.  His ultimate can affect a full team.\n\nZed's not so bad except his hidden power execution damage at the end of his ultimate.  Really frustrating to almost get away and he's like #Nope.  You can at least poke Zed until he gets lifesteal.\n\nRiven is a one trick pony of forward moving wtf damage.  I don't mind her kit except for the fact her shield scales with AD.  Makes her hard to poke down in lane before she activates ult and destroys you.  You can punish her and kick her down in lane ... but once the laning phase is over, if you can't neuter her right then and there, she outscales you.  Luckily, everyone considers her trash tier feast or famine, and don't play her often.\n\nFizz ... Riot even said it was a troll pole.
