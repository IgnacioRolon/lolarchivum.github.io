That is the main problem I believe anyone will have with the skin (of course, I am probably wrong).  And even if we are talking about culture (which let's not because Ninja's are from Japan and from my understanding, Japan and Korea really don't get along) I still think it wasn't the best idea for Ahri to get another popstar skin.
