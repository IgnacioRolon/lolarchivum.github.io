Any champs or minions running in place, health bars not changing or any *Attempting to reconnect* messages? This could be caused by a few things, I just wanted a few more details so I can be sure.","replies":[{"poster":"Naruto Senju END","date":"2017-02-10T16:38:55.297+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"None of these happen. The only thing i didn't mentioned is that, everytime i press \"s\" there is some strange noise coming. Even after I turned off the entire in-game sound, there was still this noise. And it was as loud as before.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-12T21:47:26.054+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's possible that the configuration files that save your key bindings are corrupt. I suggest completing a reset of those files with the following steps. \n\nFirst, **log into the League Client** then minimize it and navigate to your config folder, which should be in this directory:\n\n>**C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config**\n\nDelete these two files:\n**- input.ini\n- PersistedSettings.json**\n\nOnce you've deleted those files, bring the League Client back up so you can hop into a custom match and test if your settings will now save. Keep in mind that your settings in-game will be reset to default, so you'll need to redo any custom configurations you had previously set up.\n\nLet me know if this resolved the issue for you.","replies":[{"poster":"Naruto Senju END","date":"2017-02-13T12:21:20.752+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I followed all these steps, but still got those problems...","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-13T21:36:25.877+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No worries!
