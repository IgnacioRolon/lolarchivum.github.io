So like most friendly matches we started talking.\n\nNext thing we noticed as we began to be able to move was the towers were no longer functioning and minion pathing went completely nuts. The minions just stopped attacking each other and were running straight at the enemy turret. Keep in mind the towers were no longer functioning, they&#039;d become fancy stone decorations in between me and my elo. So there was about 20-30 minions piling up at each tower at this point but everything was happening at a snails pace so the minions would attack like once every 30 seconds?\n\nThis went on for about another 15 minutes as we discussed what exactly we should do, surrender? Cry? We decided to group mid and proceed to dry hump each other 5v5 in the greatest battle lag has ever seen. It wasn&#039;t pretty. People were teleporting around mid lane and disappearing. Complete insanity!\n\nAt around the 25 minute mark the lag suddenly stopped all was normal though now it seemed like the league client took a sweet rip of meth compared to what it had been previously.\n\nI teleported top lane to a massive 30+ minion wave to push a tower during the reprieve of whatever had been going on and though to my self woah I have a lot of gold where did this come from. At this very instance our teams Thresh noticed his gold was skyrocketing, like im talking 10+ gold per second, complete insanity. \n\nThe game eventually ended because our brilliant Zed came up with the idea of everyone building banner of command to help seige and by the time the lag and whatever else was happening stopped we were miles ahead in objectives.","replies":[{"poster":"XShadowAlkX","date":"2015-12-24T15:40:46.317+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's called a packet loss game.
