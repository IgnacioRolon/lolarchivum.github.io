So when I get unusual lag and start dc'ing out of no where I'm forced to disconnect. After the game i get a low priority wait time. Just last game I was playing casually everything was fine, then all of a sudden i get a 3000-5000 ping spike and i keep disconnecting, my internet was fine and everything on my end was fine. So I was forced to quit the game. After I quit i tried reconnecting after I restarted my internet but the game ended during the reconnection and now I'm left with a 5 game 20 minute wait. It just makes me mad because it prevents me from playing with my friends because they aren't willing to wait.  {{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-22T15:52:52.008+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The [leaverbuster](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ) system treats all leaves equally even if it's not intentional, because leaves still cause negative experiences for players.  If you are still having this issue then your network might be having problems holding a strong connection.
