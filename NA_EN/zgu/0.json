Your item sets still exist, and you can edit/create them in the legacy client and use them in-game while using the new client, you simply have to launch into a game to view them while inside the legacy client before they show up in the Beta Client. It's unknown at this time whether Item Set creation/editing will be in the new client later down the road or not.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]}]}
