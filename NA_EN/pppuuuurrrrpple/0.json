After switching to AT and T I get disconnected. It happens about every 1/5 games. It's really annoying because people take the internet for granted and are quick to spam \"Report him!!!!\" after I dc.\n\nI was with TWC for the longest time and this never happened to me. I'm on a 25 down / 5 up connection from at / t... it's pretty ridiculous that at / t has so many problems but these companies have monopolized the internet.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-16T21:58:36.936+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're definitely right about people taking the internet for granted. Off the top of my head, this sounds like the new connection with AT&T might be routing your signal in a much different way than how TWC was if that makes sense? \n\nI'd like to get a picture of what your connection's health looks like after it leaves your home network by running a traceroute to our NA servers at 104.160.131.1. Let that run for a few minutes and post the results here for me to take a look!","replies":[{"poster":"PPPuuuurrrrpple","date":"2018-01-16T23:58:14.302+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-17T01:20:45.811+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmm alrighty.

They may be able to look through your network logs a little more and spot something that could help you out in the meantime.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
