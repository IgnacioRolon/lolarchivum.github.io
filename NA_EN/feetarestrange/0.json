Her lure has snapped out of position/disappeared from the skin. The bug is almost always occurring but snaps back into position/reappears on certain animations, like recalling or dancing. This bug doesn&#039;t need any instructions to reproduce other than using the skin.\n\nThanks,\nFeet","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2017-01-11T20:36:22.020+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Heyo! \n\nYou'd poked me on Twitter, but just to get visibility, imma post here, too! \n\nI just logged the bug, and it's assigned out.
