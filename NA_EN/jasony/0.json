It happened in all of my recent games where i used the skin and it is kinda confusing seeing it everytime. I hope I made it as clear as possible as to what the problem is.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2017-02-06T18:31:45.926+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey again! \n\nWould you be able to provide me with your graphics settings?
