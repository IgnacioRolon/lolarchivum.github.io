When I would be done playing I would get off and if I tried to launch league after the first time the same message would pop up \"C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\libcrypto-1_1.dll is either not designed to run on Windows or it contains an error. Try installing the program again using the original installation media or contact your system administrator or the software support vendor for support.
