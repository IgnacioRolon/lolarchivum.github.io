{"poster":"Legendary Albert","date":"2016-05-23T15:16:24.341+0000","title":"League is dead, let's all fact the facts and go make Overwatch the game it should be!","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] General Discussion","up_votes":3,"down_votes":4,"body":"1: League forces you to stay in a match with toxic players. In overwatch you can just leave with no penalty.\r\n\r\n2.1 : League forces you to remain playing in a horrendously painful losing match if your duo queue trolls insist on saying no to troll you.\r\n\r\n2.2: League forces you to play with that 6   who is speeding down midlane intentionally feeding. Sorry, 30 seconds in? Already fed 2 kills? Gotta wait 19 and a half fucking minutes to even surrender.\r\n\r\n3: League has an extremely sensitive carebear chat filter and report system. In overwatch I CAN say &quot;gg easy get better scrubs&quot; and not be permabanned for it.\r\n\r\nLike let me say this again. We&#039;re permabanning people for speaking, which can be muted in a single second with a single click...\r\n\r\n... And WE&#039;RE NOT BANNING FEEDERS AND TROLLS WHO WE CAN&#039;T JUST &quot;MUTE&quot; OUR LP LOSS?\r\n\r\nSorry, I still don&#039;t get this. I agree immature comments and racism and homophobia (I am gay) are wrong... but priorities people. I can mute the person gay-bashing me, but I can&#039;t stop his ass from going AP Riven to &quot;teach me a lesson&quot;\r\n\r\n4: Solo queue doesn&#039;t even exist anymore. At all. And Riot in fact said it is never, ever ever, coming back. That detracts from the entire thought that individual skill matters-- which SHOCKINGLY DOES MATTER TO PEOPLE.\r\n\r\nBeing facerolled by that 5 man premade because your entire team is made of solo queues who aren&#039;t on vent/discord/curse/skype? Wahh, too bad. Enjoy the LP loss.\r\n\r\nOh and the best fucking part is we already had team modes. 3v3 and 5v5. Already fucking had it for people. Apparently they needed to delete solo queue (which was sadly never &quot;truly&quot; solo because it always had duo) so they could make team mode #3??????\r\n5: Playing support feels like shit in league. It feels AWESOME and rewarding in overwatch.\r\nPlaying Lucio, Mercy and Symmetra is EXTREMELY rewarding and it feels like you might actually be carrying a game when you do well on them.\r\n\r\nThere is a reason why such a tiny fraction of the playerbase in league wants to play support. It&#039;s (1) boring (2) unimpactful (3) you become a wardbot STILL\r\n6: League&#039;s graphics are like 2001 quality. It&#039;s 2016. The fact we still have some of these crap textures walking around is amazing, not even getting into some of the icons that are so bad it is amazing.\r\n\r\n7: League absolutely has no issue destroying an entire class of champions and obliterating items off of the face of the earth, multiple times.\r\ndeathfire grasp, deathcap, zhonyas, ludens echo.\r\n\r\nOh let&#039;s not forget the removal of mana regen for mages. Wonderful fucking idea in league of Zed, Yasuo and Talon.\r\n\r\n8: League has no issue leaving champions in the dirt as severely weak and pathetic\r\n   \r\n\r\n9: League has no issue releasing THE SINGLE BIGGEST LIABILITY IN GAME\r\n aka &quot;if this champ is on your team you&#039;re screwed&quot;. Her best role is ADC, where she is only the SECOND WORST CHAMPION AT THE ROLE.\r\n\r\nOh and her Q is bugged and very often fires only 1 missile. Rofl.\r\n\r\n10: Hextech crafting is a joke, I personally have felt victimized by it as I opened my 16th fucking champion shard. What is that good for? Nothing.\r\n\r\n&quot;Champion mastery&quot; and what is that good for? NOTHING.\r\n\r\nSo that is point 11. Champion mastery is a big ?????????????????????????\r\n\r\n12: Rune system is still absorbently expensive to get into and buy runes. This suffocates new players who need to buy a shitload of champions, whos IP cost has only ever INCREASED over the years. It is a new player trap and severely hurts newer players.\r\n\r\nThat is ignoring the mastery system that new players have to face against. Really fun for my IRL friends who (when solo Q) go against a smurf who has full keystones and smashes them to saturn.\r\n\r\n13: Trail of broken promises.\r\nMagma chamber, Replay, Keeping champion release prices reasonable, consistency of champion and skin releases.\r\n\r\n14: They take away fun game modes like URF nonstop and instantly. Which is hilarious. I woke up this morning to hopefully play some URF. Early this morning. Like 4:00am server time this morning.\r\n\r\nNope. Gone.\r\n\r\n15: Lack of Riot activity and player interactions. Where are they on these forums? They said they moved to a new boards system explicitly so it would be easier to interact with players. Nope, none of that-- instead we get nothing but silence.\r\n\r\n16: Adobe air.\r\n\r\nAdobe. Air.\r\n\r\n17: Skins don&#039;t even go on sale during their initial release anymore. Remember the project skin line? &quot;hehe you can just wait 6 months instead :]&quot; k thats nice. Thanks for ruining that system.\r\n\r\n18: The complete gutting of lore that still to this very day is not even close to what it used to be.\r\n\r\nAbsolutely shafting a large portion of the playerbase that included RPers, Artists, Storywriters, etc.\r\n\r\n19: Where is the &quot;yearly cinematic&quot;? Overwatch has already quadrupled the number of cinematics league has produced. Already. And it is not even released yet officially until TOMORROW.\r\n\r\n20: New content where?\r\n\r\nYou mean the champion release once every 6 months? You mean the occasional ward skin? You mean the rehashed game modes? For such a &quot;big&quot; game there is an awful lack of content.\r\n\r\n21: I am sick of being stared at awkwardly by children trying to look tough in the client. Congrats on e-sports. Really, seriously. I am not sarcastic on that one. It sounds awesome and as a nerdy kid myself who went through grade school and graduated highschool as a &quot;non jock nerd&quot; I do appreciate it.\r\n\r\nBut I don&#039;t like logging on and having some kid who looks half my age glaring at me like a thug. Give us the damn option to opt out.\r\n\r\n22: Repetitive, repetitive, repetitive.\r\n\r\nI have played so many games of league that it is insanely repetitive. In fact I am at the point where I just look at a team compostiion and can already guess most of the time if they will or will not win. It&#039;s annoying and boring when I already know with 80% certainty how a match will go based on the loading screen.\r\n\r\nWhere the HELL is the variety?\r\n\r\n23: Ohg actually most of the &quot;pro&quot; plays are amazing to watch. To see how many times the EXACT SAME TEAM COMPS AND BANS CAN GO AGAINST THE EXACT SAME TEAM COMPS AND BANS. Really cool how that always turns out.\r\n\r\n24: Scripts are still rampant. It just happens the champions used by them are less popular due to significant nerfs.\r\n   being the 3 primary sources of it.\r\n\r\nBut believe me, they are still out there in force and riot has done very little to actually address this aside from gutting the champions.\r\n\r\n25: Apathy.\r\n\r\nAND THIS IS A BIG ONE.\r\nThe player base asks for something? Riot&#039;s response 99.5% of the time? Nothing. No response. No communication. No action.\r\n\r\nIt is ignored, thrown to the side and absolutely utterly ignored. The playerbase has been shafted in favour of LC$ and their pro scene.\r\n\r\nWhen I first started at BETA PHASE of this game rioters were posting and getting into discussions and I even went on vent with a few rioters (oh yes, I really fucking did) talking about direction and ideas.\r\n\r\nWhere is that now? Where did that go?\r\n\r\nWhat happened to the philosophy of PLAYERS COME FIRST? Where Riot had their own manifesto and happily and pridefully held their head high saying that they care about players? Where did this go? Because when I began this was a magical feeling. I felt like my feelings mattered and my money mattered and that when I bought a fucking skin that I was supporting THE FUTURE OF GAMING. Not a fucking heartless cold callous business that builds a wall between it&#039;s playerbase and itself.\r\n\r\nOh wait\r\n\r\n26: This game became too big to fit it&#039;s shoes.\r\n\r\nAnd it&#039;s showing. And if you don&#039;t get what I am saying here you should think about it, because it outgrew it&#039;s shoes probably after it&#039;s first year of release. At this point? It&#039;s too big.\r\n\r\n27: Has no issue OBLITERATING champions if &quot;muh balance&quot; is at stake. And by that I mean a perpetuated hilariously false idea that some champions should never be viable or allowed to be viable despite having balanced (~50%) winrates.\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n28: Has no issue leaving flagrantly obviously broken champions as kings of the hill who, yes, are still fucking broken in the right hands.\r\n \r\n\r\n29: Biggest point is. People are sick of it too. They&#039;re sick of the nonstop let downs that just aren&#039;t stopping-- they&#039;re GAINING SPEED.\r\nLike the mage &quot;rework&quot; done on items months ago followed by this mage absolute DESTRUCTION a few weeks ago. What the hell? Like... that was the BIGGEST letdown that I ever saw.\r\n\r\n&quot;Reworks&quot; that made viable solid champions now RNG and helpless if RNG doesn&#039;t swing in their favor (RnG is now all of a sudden good design? \r\n\r\n&quot;Reworks&quot; that just gutted the AP ratios of champions \r\n\r\n&quot;Reworks&quot; from years ago that STILL piss me off \r\n\r\n&quot;Reworks&quot; that made already clunky champions feel 10000x worse \r\n\r\nLike... what?\r\n\r\nAre you seriously telling me this was a &quot;highlight&quot; of this game&#039;s development? Because sorry, not sorry, it fucking sucks.\r\n\r\nBut hey, better gut  so people stop playing him tank because    and all the other items for AP are shit now after being gutted.\r\n\r\n30: The nonstop lies, apathy and everything HAS added up. And it hasn&#039;t gone unnoticed. I am FARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR from the only person who has realized everything I posted here and more. Like... things have gone downhill.\r\n\r\nYeah you may release some amazing work like splashes and that but seriously? The game was way better back when ashe looked like this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n31: What is new? Why should I play?\r\nTo play the same 50% infuriating matches I have a thousand times over before?\r\n\r\nTo do the hextech crafting system to open yet another champion shard? &quot;Woooo content&quot;?\r\n\r\nTo play the worst champion release I&#039;ve ever seen? &quot;Woo content...?&quot; \r\n\r\nI don&#039;t get it. What is the drive or novelty to play? Why should the players stay here?\r\n\r\nWhat is new, inventive, fun?\r\n32: Obvious classes that are better than others.\r\n\r\n   who build just a single  can dominate lane and hard carry games at this point. Mages are THAT bad off. Mages without mana regen are prey for these champions because mages go OOM at the speed of sound and cannot fill their shit.\r\n\r\nAnd mages burst is gutted because MR is much &quot;heaiver&quot; stat wise and impact wise than AP is. That hexdrinker goes FARRRRRRRRRRRRRRR.\r\n\r\nLike being serious AD at this point is so much better than AP that it is glaring.","replies":[]}
