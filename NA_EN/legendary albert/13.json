Riot loves to give new champions old abilities only empowered. 2.5 seconds cast time will be a problem in Solo Q (what&#039;s that?), but in a skype team this ultimate will be abused vs a non super heavy cc teams.\n\n2. it&#039;s like {{champion:202}} and {{champion:51}}, now im not saying someone is op or broken, but this recycle of abilities needs to stop at some point. \n\n3. {{champion:44}} was all about countering heavy AD teams, infact people started taking {{champion:23}} because he was so damn weak. now after the rework, at the current rate {{champion:23}} will be nerfed as a support which will hurt his top lane.\n\nlove the rework, but what was the point?, {{champion:44}} is either a huge miss or a toxic champion (worse than {{champion:432}} )\n\nhttps://i.ytimg.com/vi/V1VbHU1CMw4/maxresdefault.jpg","replies":[]}
