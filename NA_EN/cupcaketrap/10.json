You can start or join a scored match anytime. Faction versus faction matches tied to a dynamic storyline. Factions is a community-powered League of Legends game mode in which Summoners declare for a faction, such as Noxus or Ionia, and fight matches using faction-specific Champion lists.","url":"http://leaguefactions.net/","image":"http://leaguefactions.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/rw1smrs.png?w=300"},"up_votes":14,"down_votes":2,"body":"*Is Factions \"Story & Art\"? Community Creations? Maps & Modes? I think a case can be made for all three of these options. I figured I&#039;d give Story & Art a try today. While Factions does follow its own continuity, the overwhelming majority of material is from the canonical Runeterra and established lore, and it is fundamentally an exploration of Runeterra. We spend a positively stupid amount of time digging through Riot's lore archives trying to patch things together and work out what happened when in the canonical timeline.*\n\n---\n\nI tend to write overly long posts. I&#039;ll keep this one brief.\n\nThe basic idea of **[Factions](http://LeagueFactions.net)**:\n\n* We use a poll to come up with a set of (usually) three or four factions.\n* We come up with something they might be fighting over.\n* We run matches as custom games, using faction-specific Champion lists. This creates some interesting strategic puzzles, because these constrained rosters have distinctive strengths and weaknesses.\n* We use the match outcomes to determine the course of the **[story](http://leaguefactions.net/lore/)**.\n* We organize this into **[storylines](http://leaguefactions.net/previous-storylines/)** that run for about three months.\n\n**[Sign up for a faction here.](http://leaguefactions.net/factions-sign-up/)** All skill levels are welcome. We do this in roughly three-month \"arcs\", rotating through which factions are playable. You don&#039;t have to stick with the same faction through every arc: you can fight for Piltover this time, Noxus next time, Bandle City after that, or whatever you like.\n\nThe current storyline, **[Lines in the Sand](http://leaguefactions.net/lines-in-the-sand/)**, begins in 25 CLE when Azir raises the Sun Disc and proclaims a new Shuriman Empire. War breaks out in Shurima, and the League frantically tries to contain the fighting and maintain the balance of power. Fighting on and off the Fields will determine how this new chapter in Runeterra&#039;s history plays out.\n\nThree factions are playable in this arc:\n\n* **Shurima** rallies behind Emperor Azir to throw off millennia of oppression by Valoran&#039;s great powers and the League&hellip;but divisions within Azir&#039;s court threaten to tear it apart from the inside. Turns out you really shouldn&#039;t leave Renekton and Xerath in the same building for very long. Also, some modern Shurimans think this whole \"democracy\" thing sounds better than \"rule by an immortal god-emperor who got everyone killed two thousand years ago\".\n* **Noxus** is eager to meet this new \"Emperor\" on the battlefield, and to discover if he has what it takes to survive in the modern world. It aims to either find a new ally against Demacia or else to tear Shurima apart and take its ancient power for itself. Meanwhile, tensions rise between the aristocratic traditionalists (such as the members of House DuCouteau) and Swain&#039;s \"New Noxus\".\n* **Piltover** has learned the hard way that it cannot rely on Demacia to contain Noxus. The City of Progress has turned its prodigious talents toward the construction of a hextech-powered \"New Model Army\", and seeks to \"civilize\" Shurima with technological and social development. Its efforts are centered around a high-speed railway being built through Shurima.\n\n\n---\n\nFactions is currently running in NA and EUW. If you&#039;d like to organize matches on your own server, let us know and we&#039;re happy to help.\n\nFactions is purely a creation of the community. Although some Rioters have participated in matches, Factions is volunteer-run, and has no affiliation with Riot Games. Factions began about two years ago; I was writing up a \"rito pls\" post asking for a game mode similar to their original Noxus versus Ionia tournament, and then stopped to ask myself, \"how hard would this be to just do ourselves?\" The answer turned out to be \"actually pretty hard\", but it&#039;s been worth it.","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2015-07-07T20:12:55.337+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":2,"body":">  Also, some modern Shurimans think this whole \"democracy\" thing sounds better than \"rule by an immortal god-emperor who got everyone killed two thousand years ago\".\n\nVicious slander/libel!

He was as surprised as everyone else. He was simply trying to tap into the volatile and terrible powers of the cosmos to transform himself into a living god who would rule Shurima forever. And who could possibly have suspected that Xerath\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrbKkCp43Ek\n\nwas up to something nefarious?\n\nActually, ShadowKnight has proposed that we write in something about Xerath offing **[Nefara](http://leaguefactions.net/hextech-revolution-update-2-opening-moves/)** because she was **[onto him](http://leaguefactions.net/12-secrets-of-shurima/)**. That might be a fun lore update. To speak more seriously on the topic, I did like that Old Xerath had a more sympathetic tone to him, and I think it's important that he not become simply another \"BWAHAHAHA I AM EVIL\" character.

If anything, Bio (like Jaredan) has been much too kind, to the point where I feel a little bit embarrassed myself for taking some snarky potshots at certain aspects of Riot's lore.

Not least because becoming Pirate King would probably be the boost Gangplank needs to become Bilgewater's official representative to the League. I assume that's what he was doing previously: not just making a quick buck and scoring some influence through matches, but learning how to be the smart kind of pirate who plays the various warring factions against each other and knows how to duck and weave around the law.\n\nIf you mean \"running to the League for aid\" in the sense of asking the League to topple Gangplank, I don't think Nami or Miss Fortune would see much of a chance of that. The League has a very narrow mandate: to prevent a Rune War. Arguably, Nami and MF (with their grand aspirations to make Bilgewater into more than a pirates' den) pose a greater risk of a Rune War than Gangplank. He just wants to rob people and take their stuff.\n\nI doubt Gangplank would want to pull Bilgewater out of the League. The League works out great for him. It doesn't care about piracy, certainly not so long as Demacia and Noxus shout each other down and cancel each other's votes on the matter. More rules means more rules to break, means more profit to be made by smuggling and thievery. More politicians means more pockets open to bribes. And he's both built up some expertise in gaming the system and developed a network of connections within the League and its member-states. Remember that Ionian who really, *really* wanted to steal an ancient codex of spells back from Noxus? Why, Gangplank can arrange for an accident to occur out on those treacherous high seas, see if any interesting reading material might just so happen to have been on board. You scratch my back, Summoner, and I'll scratch yours. Multiply that by years and years.\n\nThat said, I imagine that GP would have less interest in the League's grander mission than Nami or MF. In that sense, I suppose Bilgewater might back off from some of its more ambitious League commitments.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"CupcakeTrap","date":"2015-07-07T20:56:00.500+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Narasimha,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=uEUtEKWK,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-07-07T20:00:51.295+0000)\n>\n> Well, while you're here CCT, I'm kinda interested. How are you going to incorporate GP's rework into factions? He's gone from being the jolly stereotypical pirate we all know and might love, to the tyranical terror and ruler of Bilgewater.\n\nI've been so heads-down on Factions and RL that I only just saw this:\n\n> As unpredictable as he is brutal, the self-appointed pirate king known as Gangplank rules Bilgewater through a mix of fear, violence and cunning. Where he sails, death and ruin follow, and such is his infamy and reputation that the merest sight of his black sails on the horizon causes panic among even the hardiest crew.\n\n> Larger-than-life corsair kings tend to accumulate tall tales the way a warship picks up barnacles, but the tenuous balance of power in Bilgewater hinges on everyone believing the stories told about him.\n\nI think that Gangplank always had a dark side like that: I mean, he *is* a pirate. It's sometimes tricky when it's not clear what narrative frame is being used, and what you're supposed to evaluate not-so-realistically. (I mean, a story about a bunch of orphaned Goombas sobbing as they recount the murder of their parents beneath Mario's boots would sort of miss the mark.) Previously, I'd tried to reflect both elements. So far, his main appearance in Factions lore was in **[the epilogue to Hextech Revolution](http://leaguefactions.net/hextech-revolution-epilogue-2/)**. It's a POV piece from Xin in the aftermath of the Battle of Shurima, set in a League jail. Noxus and Zaun have defeated Demacia and its allies in a pitched battle, and Zaunite lawyers and Noxian political strategists have charged Jarvan under the League's laws for the attack. Meanwhile, Gangplank is drunk in an adjacent cell. Miss Fortune and Nami are trying to turn Bilgewater into something other than a source of privateers and mercenaries and win some respect in the League; Miss Fortune discovers that Gangplank's latest adventure has jeopardized that.\n\n> The door swung open again, and Miss Sarah Fortune strode through. Her pistols were missing, and she carried instead a jail tumbler, the glass variety which could be superheated and purity-hexed to ensure the total absence of poisons and tinctures. It was full to the brim with a measure of water. Xin Zhao distantly admired the athletic precision of the Champion’s movements: though her impatient strut wobbled the water to the tumbler’s lip, subtle tilts of her wrist matched the oscillations so that not a drop was spilled on her way to the cell just to the right of Jarvan’s, into which Gangplank had been placed earlier this morning.\n\n> Miss Fortune wrapped the fingers of her left hand around an iron bar and leaned forward. Her voice was enticingly warm as she purred through the bars. “You’ve got a visitor.”\n\n> Xin Zhao heard the indistinct murmuring of a man more than half asleep and still full drunk. Then he saw Miss Fortune sneer and jerk the tumbler forward. He heard a splash, followed by a startled gasp and a hacking, waterlogged cough.\n\n>“THE DEPTHS TAKE YE!” Gangplank wheezed. “YE FEVER-FACED HARPY!”\n\n> Miss Fortune glared. “Snooping around the Icathian Archives, without a permit. Are you trying to have Bilgewater expelled from the League?!”\n\n> Gangplank coughed and harrumphed. He spat throatily; a slimy sound smacked against the stone floor.\n\n> “A hunger for learnin’ be me only crime,” he quipped back. “Pardon me misplacin’ me library carrrrd.”\n\n> Xin Zhao looked Miss Fortune’s way. “Next time, bring more water. At least a bucket, for so fully ripened a stench.”\n\n> Gangplank roared. “Be that a Demacian I hear? To what hell comes I, that has whores and hall monitors alike for tormentors!?”\n\n> “Shut up!” Miss Fortune snapped. She flicked the same glare at Xin Zhao for a moment, adding, “And you shut up!” before returning to Gangplank. “This was exactly the excuse that they needed for a Council warrant to go prying up the floorboards in Bilgewater. You’d better pray that Noxus can kill that motion in committee.”\n\n> Gangplank yawned in the careless, broad way of inebriates. “Aarrrrharrrharrr. Hall monitors. Tis a pity Vayne be not here. Whores and librarians alike, that would be a fine turn o’ phr—”\n\n> “I said SHUT UP!” Miss Fortune’s eyes flared. She hurled the glass against the flagstones with a Champion’s strength; it burst into motes too small to see. She seized the bars with both hands, as though wringing a neck. The cold iron hissed, as her anger brought little flecks of residual Summoning magic forth from her veins. The muscles in her bared arms flexed murderously as she twisted her grip back and forth. Xin Zhao was somewhat surprised not to hear the bars begin to bend. So much of her anger was directed into her fists that when she spoke next, her voice came out eerily soft, even sweet.\n\n> “I wanted to have you thrown out of the League. I wanted Nami in your place in the Bilgewater delegation. I’m still writing that petition to the Council. But if they find anything that jeopardizes our standing here, I won’t need to finish it, because I’ll have your filthy pox-ridden carcass hauled out to the docks at midnight, and I’ll give a dozen orphaned sons and daughters who have you to thank for it a few lengths of pipe and some hungry,” her voice sank to a low moan, “hungry dogs.”\n\n> There was a cold pause.\n\n> Gangplank answered. “Load’a rubbish. I ain’t had the pox since I started on me citrus regimen.”\n\n> Miss Fortune twitched. Xin Zhao thought a vein on her forehead would burst. Her eyes narrowed, and she whispered liquid murder. “And then I’ll have whatever’s left mopped off the edge of the pier, and your filth will pollute Bilgewater for the last time.”\n\nI was aiming to reflect both Gangplank's Jack Sparrow goofiness and the reality that he's a murderous pirate. (The latter indirectly, through Miss Fortune.) Later on in the Nyroth arc, I tried to also show Gangplank being more fierce and frightening, to avoid the appearance that he was \"just some idiot drunk\".\n\nThis new lore, I think, indicates that it's time for Gangplank to show off his more serious side. Perhaps he's finally decided to go back home and claim the title of Pirate King. It would seem in-character for him to do a bit of a face-heel turn in the process. I'll definitely need to read more of the new Gangplank lore before I can speak intelligently on the topic, however.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Legacy of Xion","date":"2015-07-08T01:54:39.353+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mah Piltover needs meh!\n\n\n\n\n...not really.
