For a more detailed introduction, visit the About Factions page. For an overview of what's happened so far, visit the Previous Storylines page. Factions is a game mode and community lore initiative in which Summoners declare for a faction (such as Ionia or Bilgewater) and fight matches using faction-specific Champion lists.","url":"http://leaguefactions.net/factions-sign-up/","image":"https://i0.wp.com/leaguefactions.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/the-mushroom-wizard-arc-vii-banner-lines-in-the-sand.png?fit=440%2C330"},"up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"(A quick opening note on choice of forum: I think Community Creations is more appropriate than Maps & Modes for Factions, given that in addition to being a community-created game mode it&#039;s also a community lore-verse.)\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/c5LRUm6.png\nA long time ago, before Riot announced that it was breaking the connection between the game and its lore, it leveraged the League setting to immerse the community in the evolving story of Runeterra. Most notably, when Ionia challenged the Noxian occupation of its southern islands in the League of Legends, Riot used **[an actual League match](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Ionia_versus_Noxus:_Rematch)** to decide what would happen next. Ionia prevailed, and Noxus was ejected from its territory. (That match also led to the creation of a new item, the Ionian Boots of Lucidity.) Although the match itself took place before I joined League, I was really pleased to discover this event. I started thinking about how we might encourage Riot to continue this trend. I decided to create **[Factions](http://LeagueFactions.net)**, a community game mode that uses matches fought with faction-specific Champion lists to determine the outcomes of in-universe disputes before the League of Legends.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/4tIYMQF.png\n\nWe organize Factions into discrete story arcs, each lasting about three months, and each centering around a different set of playable factions. At the start of each arc, Summoners can declare for one of the featured factions. (You&#039;re free to declare as you like, regardless of whom you may have fought for in previous arcs.) You can then start or join a match anytime; the teams send in the results for scoring, which contributes to a running tally dubbed the Balance of Power.\n\nhttp://img1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20100917003131/leagueoflegends/images/9/98/Institute_of_War.jpg\n\nThe year is 25 CLE. It has been nearly two years since war last came to Valoran during the **[Shon-Xan](http://leaguefactions.net/shon-xan/)** conflict, which all but destroyed the Noxian war machine and left Demacia as Valoran's sole superpower, until it too was brought low in the chaos of the Hextech Revolution.\n\nhttp://leaguefactions.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/hextech-banner-sgtporkchop.png\n\nThe discovery of Void-touched \"dark sand\" in Shurima, called *pyrikhos* in the native Shuriman tongue, provided a versatile and abundant hextech energy source that catalyzed the so-called **[Hextech Revolution](http://leaguefactions.net/hextech-revolution/)**. Shurima's ancient secrets came to light as the great powers of Valoran sought to harness the energy of the pyrikhos, a strange hybrid of extradimensional Void energy and the faded enchantments of the Shuriman ruins. It was the pyrikhos that enabled Zaun to construct the fearsome HexKorps, a mechanized techmaturgic army that (alongside a resurgent Noxus) broke the might of Demacia in **[a pitched battle](http://leaguefactions.net/hextech-revolution-update-8-shield-of-light/)**.\n\n{{champion:75}} \"The secrets of Shurima were not destined to remain buried forever—though perhaps they should.\"\n\nThis time is remembered as well for the release of dark horrors such as **[the lich queen Nefara](http://leaguefactions.net/hextech-revolution-update-2-opening-moves/)** and the Void beast Rek'Sai. Seeing Shurima fall into darkness, Azir joined the League seeking allies. Some thought that he might bring a petition for Shuriman independence from the League-sponsored protectorate that oversaw its territory. But Valoran's eyes soon turned away from Azir and Shurima to the strange land of **[Nyroth](http://LeagueFactions.net/part-vi-nyroth)**, a continent discovered to the west of Valoran.\n\nhttps://leaguefactions.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/nyrothhalfybanner.png\n\nNyroth was once home to a great civilization, tragically destroyed by the aftershocks of Valoran runespells a thousand years ago. Under Nami's leadership, a grand maritime alliance of Bilgewater, the Marai, and the Atlanteans took the world stage and won the respect of the great powers of Valoran. Though Bilgewater showed astonishing resolve, Ionia ultimately prevailed on the Fields, and (together with Lissandra and the Frostguard) worked a spell that mended the damage done to Nyroth by the recklessness of ancient Valoranians. The echoes of this spell coursed through Valoran's leyline networks, breathing new life into their nexuses.\n\nAs the energy of the pyrikhos fades, Shurima sinks back into the distance. It is a wasteland, an endless stretch of dead sand and lost hope, a battleground for others with no voice of its own. Noxus seeks to rein in Zaun's ambitions, wary of being usurped by its former client-state. Meanwhile, Piltover strives to \"civilize\" Shurima, using a new stretch of the velocitronic railway (meant to link Demacia with Bandle City) as a backbone. Few pay any mind to Azir and Sivir speaking quietly with their most trusted Summoners, researching old spells from a bygone era. For the radiance of Nyroth's rebirth has reached even into Shurima, lifting the outlines of the old enchantments above the distortion of the Void. They prepare a ritual to work the impossible…\n\n---\n\n{{champion:245}} Was that Jax?\n{{champion:154}} Yup. You a fan? I'll introduce ya.\n{{champion:245}} It's a lot to take in. Never seen this many Summoners before.\n{{champion:154}} Give it a couple more weeks, and they'll be calling you Champion. Trying to do you favors left and right.\n{{champion:245}} If they let me in. The whole Judgment thing creeps me out. Sounds like a PsiKorps interrogation.\n{{champion:154}} It's not. They're the good guys.\n{{champion:154}} …mostly. Look, the thing is, you can't let all the Champion stuff go to your head. You gotta rem—\n(A great bell tolls. The walls shake.)\n{{champion:245}} !\n{{champion:154}} Aw, come on. Not today.\n{{champion:40}} Zac. Come quickly. The Herald of the League speaks.\n{{champion:245}} What's happening?\n{{champion:154}} Nothing good.\n{{champion:40}} *Quickly!*\n\n> Hear ye and be warned! The Council of the League of Legends, final arbiter among nations, shall hear the petition of Azir, Champion of the League, that Shurima be recognized as a sovereign member-state, and that those territorial divisions recognized by the Shuriman Resolution of 1 CLE shall be subject to challenge upon the Fields of Justice.\n> \n> And furthermore let it be known that the Empire of NOXUS, on its own part and representing the interests of the Teknopolis of Zaun, shall be recognized as a party to this dispute, and that the Municipal Republic of PILTOVER, on its own part and representing the interests of the Amicable Enclave of Bandle City, shall also be so recognized.\n> \n> But be it known that all other League nations are hereby forbidden to deploy soldiers into Shurima for the duration of this conflict, nor shall any Champion or Summoner not granted entrance into the dispute do violence either temporal or arcane to those within the disputed region. The combatants shall refrain from the use of forbidden rune magics, nor shall this affront to the peace of Runeterra extend beyond the boundaries of Shurima. With solemn contemplation of the horrors of the Rune Wars, the party-disputants are urged to seek peace; but by no means shall this conflict be suffered to endure beyond the 31st day of August, 25 CLE.\n> \n> Let the word of the League be as law, lest all the nations of Runeterra arrange themselves against ye. There may be no appeal.\n\n{{champion:40}} You must return to Zaun at once. You will be needed.\n{{champion:154}} Real sorry to cut the tour short, kid, but we've got work to do. C'mon.\n\n---\n\nA new dispute has come before the League. After many years of wandering the desert in search of the lost fragments of his empire, Azir has resolved to sweep away the territorial lines drawn across Shurima over the millennia, and restore its former glory.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/APxuwKs.jpg\nWe are now on our seventh story arc: **[Lines in the Sand](http://leaguefactions.net/factions-sign-up/)**. This arc begins with Azir raising the Sun Disc and declaring the resurrection of the Shuriman Empire. His grand proclamation was swiftly answered by a friendly legion of Noxians, who showed up to congratulate Azir and let him know that they&#039;d be taking all those pretty new artifacts he&#039;s dredged up, along with his lunch money. To their considerable surprise, Azir&#039;s magic, combined with bands of mercenaries led by Sivir, drove Noxus back from the walls. Meanwhile, the disorganized nomads of Shurima Desert, long accustomed to being pushed around by the great powers of Valoran, their lands subdivided and redistricted by League ordinances, ransacked Piltover&#039;s latest public works project. With Piltover and Noxus off-balance, Azir&#039;s agents in the League submitted a petition for member-state status.\n\nA temporary truce has been imposed on Shurima, but it is not expected to last long. It is all the League can do to keep the likes of Demacia and Zaun out of Shurima; when the truce breaks, battle will surely be joined not only on the Fields but also in Shurima itself. These three factions now seek Summoners and Champions to fight for their cause, on and off the Fields.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/5PUxCVr.png\n\nYou can declare for a faction **[here](http://leaguefactions.net/factions-sign-up/)**.

There was a thread on the Factions forum a little while ago that was basically just Factioners raving about how much they liked you. Somethingsomething \"glowing\" reviews. :3\n\nSo, a few things.\n\nFirst off, I'd probably encourage you to just give it a shot. I'm absolutely awful at every Champion who isn't Veigar. There was a video somewhere of me playing Draven for Noxus, while a couple Noxian Diamonds on voice chat tried to coach me. \"Yeah, just—no, no, why would you max W? STOP!\" (But I did sort of learn how to play Galio and Jarvan.) The way I see it, trying out new Champs is part of the fun. Factions is actually kind of educational that way. Relatedly, I found it was helpful as a way to learn different team comps, because the constrained rosters often require you to think outside the usual \"hard engage AoE of death\" solo queue teamfight. Besides, Factions really is meant to mostly be a fun break from the agony of solo queue. Some people get pretty into it, but I try to promote a lighthearted, casual atmosphere.\n\nSecond, the rosters do expand somewhat over the course of the arc. Actually, we're due for our first Champion pickup poll. Making do with teensy starting rosters is sort of a tradition. (Granted, we do get some quite reasonable pushback from people who would rather see factions start off with essentially full rosters. We might try that next arc.)\n\nFinally, I can't pass up the opportunity to repeat the old Factions joke about Noxus and supports. \"Yeah, *you* try telling a Noxian to go 'support' another Champion. We don't need supports. You want wards? How about stacking up the bloodied corpses of our slain enemies? You want slows? Hmm, how about *axes?* You want hard CC? Is *death* hard enough for you?\"\n\nAnyway, pleased as punch to see your post in this thread! It made my evening. (Though it also made me go \"oh man, I really need to go get some more prepwork done for this arc!\" Rioters signing up is sort of like realizing that company's coming over.) I hope you have fun!\n\nThe Council awaits your declaration, Summoner Bioluminescence of the Riotous Fists Clan.","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2015-06-03T07:07:46.731+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ha!  Way to make a person self conscious :P  No need to tidy on my account - I'm just another player who's heard good things about the Factions thing you've got going.  Whatever you do don't expect any decent plays -  I could probably be considered a handicap to whatever poor nation I side with.\n\nBut you're right - I should pick a faction and give their champs a go for great victory!  (Or at least a fun learning experience.)  \n\nI've played with Rioters who have argued that the best CC is killing the opponent.  They're not wrong, but it's like that old Korean-advice joke that goes around - What do you do if you need an extra 50 gold?  Just destroy the enemy nexus!","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"AffableZombie","date":"2015-06-03T16:51:30.515+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ill do it just tell me what to do.
