We take the results of these matches, which anyone can start anytime, and use them to determine where the story goes next.\n\nToday, Riot declared that it was simply not possible for them to write stories with the League and Summoners in the way.\n\nWith all due respect, I must question the sincerity of their efforts to do so before giving up, because a bunch of random players did it in their free time.\n\nTake a look: **[The Lore of Factions](http://leaguefactions.net/2014/09/05/factions-lore/)**\n\nNeedless to say, given that Factions is all about the League and Summoners, we're not super happy about Riot's decision here. We'll deal.  But seriously, what gives?\n\nThey say that they can't have a war or other conflict because of the League. I guess they just couldn't come up with a workaround. Meanwhile, over at Factions, it seemed pretty obvious to us: the League's mission is to prevent apocalypse, not ensure world peace. They don't ban all war, they just insist that the states involved do not escalate the conflict to world-explodey levels, and eventually they step in and say \"enough is enough\" before enforcing a treaty.\n\nThey also said that it was just too hard explaining why Champions would join the League. Okay. Jinx? You really have a hard time understanding [why *Jinx* would want to join something that involved blowing things up all day and getting paid for it?](http://leaguefactions.net/hextech-revolution-update-5-get-jinxed/)\n\n**EDIT:** As for **Summoners**, I'd like to add something further. I agree that omnipotent mind-controlling slavemasters are a creepy concept. That's not how I view Summoners, and it's not how they are in Factions. In Factions, Summoners are there to use their magic to help Champions out, while giving tactical advice and watching out for incoming attacks. I'm entertained by the idea of Summoners and Champions yelling at each other in the halls from time to time about \"how could you miss that gank!?\" or \"you're the one who can't hit Alistar from 20 feet away, Mr. It's All Skill!\" I think it's really important to give players a place in the story.\n\nI'd like to hear Riot honestly try to make the case that it was just impossible to tell good stories with a setting that still left the game itself making some kind of in-universe sense.","replies":[{"poster":"CupcakeTrap","date":"2014-09-05T00:49:48.939+0000","up_votes":31,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've seen a couple different Rioters, defending against complaints from the playerbase, insisting that this is important because it allows them to drive the story forward in ways they couldn't before, *like having Champions die for real.*\n\nOoookay, narrative team.

In the wake of the new lore changes, \"Let's settle this on the Fields of Justice!\" just sounds like \"Let's settle this with a children's card game!\" to me. \n\nThe League just doesn't work unless champions have no relationship to each other whatsoever or are all backstabbing scumbags willing to betray their friends in order to... *what*, exactly? For fame? For power? For the Freljord? The League has always been a flimsy story construct.\n\nThe idea that there's an entire world behind League of Legends is laughable when any and all conflicts that ever happen are fought in *one* unchanging field where no one dies. \n\nIf the League is to be considered a serious political entity, you have to submit to one of these hilarious truths:\n\n* That everyone is okay with having geopolitical struggles solved by meaningless battle in a field by people who are thrown together at complete random to fight, regardless of their actual affiliations with one another or their \"opponents\"\n\nOR\n\n* That the fights are done for entertainment only, and the notoriety gained by arena warfare is enough to hold sway in actual politics the world over. \n\nNeither of these are practical, sensible, or believable. If Riot wants to move forward, and they want to do so by axing the idea of there being a League, I say more power to them. Only time will tell, however, if they do anything meaningful with their newfound freedom. As much as I'd love to read a novel following Ashe's exploits in attempting to unite the disparate clans of the Freljord, I have sincere doubts that we'll get anything remotely close. \n\nAll in all, while I approve of the shift in lore direction, I don't think this means any change whatsoever in how lore is created or distributed.

(\"The Council has made their decision—now let them enforce it!\") It's just trying to set some limits to prevent warfare from destroying the planet.\n\nFactions don't always respect the League, in Factions (e.g. when Demacia violated a League peace edict by marching on Zaun's mines in Shurima) or in regular LoL lore (where Demacia and Noxus fought over Kalamanda). So far, the League has been able to keep these outbursts somewhat in check, but only because the factions are ultimately in agreement about the risk of mutually assured destruction.\n\nWhy do the powerful factions continue supporting the League? There are really two components.\n\n**Warfare**  \nWhen it comes to the \"big\" issues, like the invasion of Shon-Xan, the major factions recognize that the League is a necessary arbiter to prevent another Rune War. It's not that different from the Cold War: yes, they'll skirmish, and fight proxy battles, but at the end of the day they'll keep their nukes in their silos and agree to be bound by a diplomatic regime they created because they realize, as Joshua would say, THE ONLY WINNING MOVE IS NOT TO PLAY.\n\n**Smaller disputes**  \nMost of what the League handles is not massive wars, but smaller arguments. A Bilgewater ship runs aground in the Isles, and Karthus wants to make them permanent residents, so there's a fight in the League for the fate of the crew. Piltover is taxing cupcakes from Bandle City at a higher rate because they argue the freshness charm on them makes them \"magical artifacts\"; Bandle City's yordlawyers disagree, so a round of what we call \"solo queue matches\" resolves the matter.

Honestly, it sounds like the Lore team just gave up trying to fit the story with the game, and it disappoints me to hear that. I'm sure there's a ton of reasons as to why they did it, but this is a video game. In order to tell the story best in a video game, you have to use the strengths from the media, instead of divorcing it completely from how the majority of players will experience the story.\n\nWhat really bothers me is that since the game and story are separate, those special interactions between champs have little meaning, and all of our actions as summoners have no meaning at all. The champs themselves will feel like toys when I play them, rather than an actual living thing. When I hear Lucian curse Thresh for killing his wife, I'm just going to see two puppets acting out some play on a stage, instead of understanding the pain that Lucian went through, and the joy Thresh feels for his acts. When the Three Queens side quest appears, I'm not going to care who wins, because I know what my team does in that match literally does not matter in terms of the overarching story of the game.\n\nWhat I would have preferred is that champions not ALWAYS be a part of the League. I don't believe the way the League works right now requires a constant commitment to it, and even if it does Riot could retcon that so it works that way. This way, champions don't have to have a specific reason to join the League in their lore (like the new champs) unless it's relevant, and can join when they have a specific reason too. For example, let's say that Demacia is facing off against the Shadow Isles, because reasons. Lucian normally wouldn't be allied with Demacia despite being raised there, but in this case would side with them and join the League. Also, if the lore was handled in this way, there could be events that happen every once in a while, and depending on summoners actions (perhaps Factions battles, perhaps something else), events could end differently. Maybe events could involve special matches, like the 1v1 Snowdowns, or could effect how a champion plays for a while in normal matches. There's a lot of ways that this could have been handled, and I just don't agree that removing the lore from the game is the way to go.\n\nI'll end this with one more thing: someone had made the comparison between this and Super Smash Bros., in that the games we play now are just fantasy matches with League champs. The main fundamental flaw with this thinking is that in SSB, the characters you play are actually dolls or trophies because that's how that game works, and that's really what that game is: pit Nintendo characters against each other because it would be cool to see how they would fight and who would win. League of Legends is not that kind of a game. The characters are not dolls, they are living creatures in the lore.

However if that's not the case then it's more likely Vel'koz theorized that temporary loss of control of body is a respectable tradeoff for all the knowledge he is gaining","replies":[{"poster":"CupcakeTrap","date":"2014-09-05T06:59:52.353+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"> In actual Runeterra it's more likely the summoners act as tacticians, guiding their actions and empowering them.\n\nThis is indeed the Factions version.

I should really just do a post about this at this point, but here's the quick version:\n\n* Summoners are powerful mages. They're not all-powerful. The League's power is maintained because Demacia and Noxus see fit to keep it in place (for now), and because the nations of Valoran recognize that without the League as referee sooner or later the planet will blow up.\n* Summoners do not mind-control Champions. They back them up, advising them and helping them with magic.\n* I don't see Summoners as actually yanking Champions onto the Fields from wherever they may be. Champions show up when they want to show up, but Summoners do have the authority to request their presence. Champions show up for the same reason they joined the League: they win favor (and probably even get paid directly) by the factions who call them forth.\n\nIf Riot's going to do a major overhaul of lore, why not revise rather than destroy?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Whitakker","date":"2014-09-05T13:06:37.603+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://assets.diylol.com/hfs/6d3/eb0/df2/resized/shots-fired-meme-generator-shots-fired-08537a.jpg?1348337891.jpg\n\nYou're doing God's work, CCT.","replies":[{"poster":"CupcakeTrap","date":"2014-09-05T17:12:37.722+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"^.^","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Godwyn","date":"2014-09-05T17:27:47.277+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't have much to add, except perhaps a wish that the factions creators were in charge of the new lore instead of whoever is.","replies":[]},{"poster":"dialMARK4acti0n","date":"2014-09-05T09:45:28.147+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"What about Yasuo? \"Yeah, I feel like putting this sword to use by fighting the people trying to arrest me, meanwhile, trying to find out if one these 120 other dudes killed my master...
