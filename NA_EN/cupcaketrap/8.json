Story Both Miss Fortune and Gangplank had long had ambitious plans for Bilgewater. An uneasy truce held for a time, as they combined forces with Nami in the battle for Nyroth, but that time passed.","url":"http://leaguefactions.net/burning-tides/","image":"https://i1.wp.com/leaguefactions.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/bilgewater-tournament-banner-raptorattacks-edit1.png?fit=440%2C330"},"up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://i.imgur.com/oMfdlNW.png\r\n\r\nOne of the major reasons I liked Burning Tides was that, although it definitely moved the story forward and brought in new material, it also clearly took pains to remain largely &quot;backwards-compatible&quot; with prior lore.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to me that Burning Tides could definitely be incorporated into **[Factions](http://LeagueFactions.net)** continuity, i.e., a pre-retcon continuity that takes the admittedly unorthodox and perhaps even scandalous step of modifying the League of Legends universe to include a League of Legends. **[So we did!](http://leaguefactions.net/burning-tides/)** We held two sets of matches this past weekend: one to decide the balance of power within Bilgewater itself, through a battle over the Slaughter Docks, and one to decide which leader the League would recognize as Bilgewater&#039;s emissary after the abrupt &quot;leave of absence&quot; taken by the figurehead Governor. We ran these as 4v4s, to allow us to stick to &quot;core&quot; Bilgewater Champions, and while it took a bit of twisting and nudging, it wasn&#039;t that hard to come up with two fairly balanced teams of four Champions each.\r\n\r\nWe were very pleased to have guest casters KyleDangerHenick and Venia Vis with us, as well as guest Summoner KateyKhaos of the illustrious Riotous Fists Clan, asked by Nami herself to serve as her Summoner for the second of the matches on the first day.\r\n\r\nThanks to everyone who participated! This was a ton of fun, and I think also serves as a tribute to Jaredan and company for making lore that innovates without totally discarding prior lore.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nOh, right, I should also do the &quot;What&#039;s Factions?&quot; thing. To use my standard explanation: **[Factions](http://LeagueFactions.net)** is a community game mode and lore initiative, inspired by Riot&#039;s Noxus versus Ionia tournament back in the day. We come up with something that various factions of Runeterra (e.g. Piltover, Demacia) might be fighting over, then run matches using faction-specific Champion lists and use the outcomes of those matches to decide how the storyline develops.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-08-12T22:26:05.707+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for inviting me, this was an awesome event! :D","replies":[]}]}
