I think this qualifies as a thread about various Champions&#039; themes and relations to Piltover. It&#039;s a bit speculative from a canon perspective, but so far as I can tell, most of what we do on this board is speculative anyway. (Insert \"dark and mysterious past\" joke here.)\n2. Nobody reads Community Creations. That&#039;s something I&#039;d love to change, but in the short-term, that&#039;s the reality.\n\nSo, background. **[Factions](http://LeagueFactions.net)** is a community game mode based around&hellip;you know what, I&#039;ve typed that out so many times that I&#039;m just going to stop there, and instead say: in Factions, we have faction versus faction matches (e.g. Demacia versus Noxus), and each faction gets to choose from Champions affiliated with that faction. Factions start off with smaller default rosters made up of the Champions with the strongest connections, but Summoners can also recruit more Champions as the arc progresses, which both adds in some story developments and brings in a meta-strategy element.\n\n# Tiers of Champions\nHere&#039;s the tl;dr on Champion categorization:\n\n* **Core.** Champions whose absence from the roster would be downright bizarre, given how strongly connected they are to the faction. Examples would include Garen for Demacia. Factions start each arc with at least their full Core list.\n* **Secondary.** Champions whose presence on the roster would be largely unobjectionable. These Champions are easy to recruit, and factions may also start with some of them to pad out their lineup.\n* **Tertiary.** Champions who have some connection to the faction, but are kind of weird or out of place. These are \"expensive\" pickups, consuming two pickup slots whereas Secondaries consume only one. In-universe, recruiting them often involves pulling strings with the League, making them special promises, tilting the faction&#039;s objectives to satisfy them, and so on.\n\nThere are presumably in-universe rules for who gets to recruit which Champions. We purposely leave that kind of vague, so as to avoid the need for some massive exegesis of League Champion selection law. Really, it&#039;s more of an out-of-universe question of how well the Champions fit together.\n\n# Factors\nAnd here&#039;s the quick version of the main factors we consider:\n\n* **Story.** The Champion&#039;s written story. This includes both Riot lore and Factions lore. A Core Champion should have a really powerful Story connection. (e.g. Jarvan is the crown prince.) A Secondary needs to have at least a moderate connection. (e.g. Ahri lives in Ionia, even if she cares more about eating/not eating livers than helping Karma with anything.) A Tertiary ideally has at least a teeeeensy bit of Story connection. (e.g. there&#039;s some throwaway mention of Shaco having lots of fans in Noxus.)\n* **Theme/Feel.** The Champion&#039;s overall tone. This might include their visual appearance, their VO, or just the tropes they invoke. A classic Secondary-level combination is a dash of Story and a big dose of Theme, as with Ahri: even if her written backstory had her as being from the Freljord or something, she&#039;s a freaking kitsune (or the Korean equivalent) and obviously belongs with fantasy Asia. Leona is arguably an example of a Secondary based on Theme, for Demacia: though her Story connection is weak, she&#039;s a knight in shining armor type of character who fits right in.\n* **Gameplay.** Part of the fun of Factions is that factions tend to develop unique playstyles. For example, Demacia is known for its aggressive all-in teamfight that involves everyone pushing R and shouting DEMACIA! really loudly. A Champion gets some bonus points if they enhance this playstyle, or meet some other Gameplay objective, like providing a lower-IP option for ADC. Note that filling in a gap or weakness is not really a Gameplay strong point; factions get their unique identities in part from their limited rosters. Necessity is the mother of invention and all that.\n\nSo those are the main factors.\n\n# Piltover\nSo, Piltover. Piltover doesn&#039;t have a lot of Champions. It just doesn&#039;t. Here&#039;s what we have so far:\n\n**Current Roster**\nThese are the Champions they already have. Most are Core; it doesn&#039;t really matter, though.\n{{champion:51}} {{champion:81}} {{champion:74}} {{champion:40}} {{champion:126}} {{champion:254}} {{champion:115}} \nThe current roster is locked in, for better or worse. Just providing it for context.\n\n**Secondary**\nThese are easily recruitable Champions for Piltover. Definitely looking for suggestions here.\n{{champion:53}} {{champion:42}} {{champion:61}} {{champion:26}} {{champion:154}} {{champion:18}} \n\n**Tertiary**\nThese are \"reach\" options.\n{{champion:99}} {{champion:21}} {{champion:17}} {{champion:111}} {{champion:5}} \n\nI actually think there&#039;s a case for Tristana being Secondary, given her use of tech. Veigar is there only as a hostile to Noxus, another faction in this arc. Lux is there for that reason as well, although she also has a few other factors I won&#039;t get into.\n\nSo. Any ideas? Particularly looking for more Champions to add to their list of options. I&#039;m trying to give each faction at least five. Piltover is also in a rough spot balance-wise, and could use a hand.\n\n**Some Ideas**\n{{champion:111}}\n\n* **Story (weak).** Nautilus has some questions about his origins or whatever. Piltover has science that could help answer those questions.\n* **Theme (moderate).** As a big old-fashioned diving suit, he does have a bit of a Piltover look to him.\n* **Gameplay (weak).** He&#039;s not really a poke champ.\n\n{{champion:76}} \n\n* **Story (weak).** If anything, you&#039;d think Nidalee would dislike the City of \"Progress\". On the other hand, Piltover is a champion of \"clean\" technology, and Piltover sure is a lot better than Zaun in that regard.\n* **Theme (negative).** She&#039;s a primal huntress. They&#039;re a clockwork-steampunk-technological civilization. ~~Together, they fight crime.~~ They clash horribly.\n* **Gameplay (strong).** On the plus side, she&#039;s a great (\"great\") poke champ, and Piltover&#039;s traditional strategy is poke-heavy.","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2015-06-03T20:34:15.543+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"How about:\n\n{{champion:21}} \n* **Story (moderate).**  Miss Fortune wants to unite Bilgewater and fight off the pirates - well, that would make Bilgewater more of a trade hub, and Piltover is all about water based trade of goods and knowledge.

Their options were Gangplank, Miss Fortune, and Nami. They went with Nami, taking Bilgewater on a more idealistic and \"big picture\" path. Gangplank would have been more \"Yar har har, let's plunder the heck out of this Nyroth place\", while Miss Fortune would have been more of a middle-ground, \"let's get our act together\" option.)\n\nNami's pretty inexperienced, but she's smart, and (maybe unlike Miss Fortune) has that raw youthful ambition that believes anything's possible. MF would have tripped up less, I think, but it's not clear to me that she would have been able to pull off the grand alliance between Bilgewater and the Marai/Atlanteans.\n\nWe need to finish up the rest of the Nyroth lore. And yeah, a major concern of mine is that Nami not look flat-out useless. (Tricky, because I think one of her strategies is to play up her naivete and goodness to win over others.)

But now that you mention Miss Fortune, I have to say she pareto dominates Graves for this. I'll swap her in for him.\n\nThematically, she's more or less in the same spot as Graves: kiiiinda sorta compatible with Piltover, or at least, with some subsection of Piltover. Her apparent \"tech level\" is comparable.\n\nGameplay-wise, Piltover already has tons of ADC options, but she does have some great poke.\n\nThe story dimension is what really sold me. Here's a rough big-picture sketch of some ideas. A lot of this is highly debatable, but it's plausible.\n\nHistorically, Piltover's been Demacia's not entirely friendly trading partner. Demacia provides protection and some paternalistic frowning at their use of this unseemly \"hextech\" business, while Piltover keeps Demacia's command economy from going bankrupt and serves as a \"lesser of two evils\" option whenever hextech comes into play. They're both vaguely on the \"lawful\" side of the spectrum, though Piltover is significantly more progressive and individualistic. Pilts may be stuffy by Zaunite standards, but Demacia can non-hyperbolically be called a totalitarian regime—albeit a strange one, in that the people in power really do drink the same Kool-Aid as the commoners. (I see that as one of the more interesting twists about Demacia: \"medieval Europe, if the high-and-mighty really did live by the idealistic code they flattered themselves with.\" But I digress.)\n\nSimilarly, Bilgewater has been a source of privateers for Noxus—yes, we know that whole thing with Katarina was just a throwaway reference to pitch her skin, but we've run with it—and an option for those merchants who want their goods moved without pesky Demacian questions about their choice of cargo. People on Miss Fortune's side of the respectability line probably did their fair share of trade with Piltover, and even with Demacia. Still, Noxus was paying the bills for the most part. I can see even the more \"lawful\" residents believing that Noxian justice was a better bargain than living in fear of crazy drunken pirates taking whatever they want. They can't really ask Demacia for help, because while Demacia loves to be Big Damn Heroes, it also tends to do this thing where it first protects you from your external enemies, then starts talking about protecting you from yourself. Unlike Noxus, Demacia is not going to make some pragmatic deals that let pirates do their thing so long as they plunder along certain lines laid out in the arrangement. Bilgewaterians probably think Noxians are creepy, but in the old regime, they kind of had to go along—like Piltover grudgingly had to go along with Demacia.\n\nSo, when these two factions defined themselves entirely by their superpower affiliations, their relations were rather frosty, or at least awkward. But now Demacia and Noxus have both been put through the wringer, and are in pretty bad shape after smashing each other around for so long. Simultaneously, the **[Hextech Revolution](http://leaguefactions.net/hextech-revolution/)** opened a lot of doors for Piltover, and Nami's consolidation of the Marai and Atlanteans under the Bilgewater banner (combined with her \"soft power\" gains in the League via some **[endearing Mr. Smith goes to Washington stories](http://leaguefactions.net/nyroth-update-3-not-your-hero/)** about her quest for the Moonstone) has made Bilgewater more of a serious player, rather than just a mouthpiece for corrupt merchants and actual pirates.\n\nI can definitely see Piltover and Bilgewater, or at least certain Champions from each state, deciding that they're tired of being lackeys of these psychotically bloodthirsty superpowers, and want to talk on their own terms. It's a stretch, and it would be a change, but…to me, that's the best-case scenario for a Tertiary pickup: a bit of a curveball that adds a new dimension to the story, and moves some characters' storylines forward.","replies":[{"poster":"Nybx4life","date":"2015-06-04T17:55:35.010+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd like to add:\nGiven that Graves had someone rig him his shotgun he used to escape prison, I'd say he's liable to help Piltover as a way to repay that favor.\nOtherwise, I'd like to say {{champion:24}} Jax would be a great option to add as a wildcard, given his status as a mercenary.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Academy Kayn","date":"2015-06-04T04:27:07.933+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"So, what are your thoughts on {{champion:432}}.

Indeed, disagreement is often a good motivation for joining: would you rather let \"those jerks\" speak for your faction, or would you rather try to get into the action yourself?**\n\nBriefly and broadly, many of the League's member-states have internal divisions of varying levels of seriousness, which adds another dimension to their interactions with the League. In some cases, these divisions run so deep that malcontent subfactions will throw their support behind a foreign faction. In other cases, subfactions that disagree on most matters nonetheless find a common cause in the narrow topic of the dispute, and work together on the Fields. Perhaps most commonly, the subfactions come to a temporary agreement about leadership in the foreign arena, and fight together for their shared victory while simultaneously vying for control of the faction's agenda from within.\n\nThat's all a bit abstract, so let me grab some examples. I'm writing rather off-the-cuff here, but I hope it sort of addresses your question.\n\n* **Ionia** is historically a rather fragmented state, with a \"Council of Elders\" that mediates disputes among the clans but lacks plenary authority over \"domestic\" matters within said clans. It's plausible that this was part of why they weren't members of the League: there was too much internal disagreement for them to put forward a real representative. But then everything changed when ~~the Fire Nation~~ Noxus attacked. Karma convinced the clans to give her the authority she needed to represent them in the League, and she used this leverage to solidify Ionia's leadership. Her remarkable diplomatic skills allowed her to bring home the League bacon rather impressively. The subfactions of Ionia definitely retain a lot of independence, and presumably bicker with each other, but when League matters arise they tend to agree \"let's let Karma do her thing\".\n* **The Freljord** was in the middle of a civil war until quite recently, and there's still some scattered fighting. Ashe is nominally the Queen of the Freljord, though her position is quite tenuous. Sejuani openly disrespects her at home and abroad. Still, they did band together to join the League in the Mirrorwater dispute, and did so again during Nyroth. In contrast to Ionia, which has a semi-permanent \"foreign representative\" in Karma, the Freljord still seems to need some kind of ad hoc leadership selection process whenever it has to do something important in the League.\n* **Noxus** is fairly centralized, though there is something of a rift between Swain and his Zaun-influenced \"New Noxus\" movement and the aristocratic traditionalists.\n* **Zaun** is inherently decentralized, more of a place than a regime. Janna often takes the side of Piltover in disputes, seeking to control Zaunite megacorporations with external policies; Zac is still usually trying to work from within.\n\nOkay, this is turning into a long answer, so I'm going to skip to what I think is the upshot, about Champion selection.\n\nRivals coming together (reluctantly, and often in a very unfriendly way) is part of the fun. It adds a lot of tension, and gives Summoners some choices about how to steer their faction. It's not that common for a \"rival\" Champion to actually break ranks with the faction and sign up with the opponent; usually, even rivals can agree on \"more cash/magic/power/whatever for our faction\", though they may bicker about the division of the loot. As for why they don't \"just stay out of it\", think about it from their perspective. What's going to allow them to make the biggest difference? Scowling in a corner, or making a deal with their rivals, whereby they lend them their aid in exchange for policy changes or a bigger cut of the take?\n\nAn extreme example of this came up in Mirrorwater. Bandle City wasn't able to get into the dispute as its own faction, but Piltover was. Rumble absolutely loathes Piltover, and is obsessed with Bandle City breaking out of its \"sidekick\" role to become a great state in its own right. But he signed up for Piltover, not because he likes Piltover, but because he realized that if Piltover were to win the Mirrorwater, its science and technology would leap even further ahead of Bandle City, possibly dooming the yordles to languish in Piltover's shadow forever. So he made a deal. He agreed to fight for Piltover, on the condition that, should they win, Bandle City would also have access to the Mirrorwater. His best-case scenario, Bandle City winning the Mirrorwater all for itself, was impossible. So, he made what he considered a deal with the devil in order to make the worst-case scenario less awful. The deal was easy to make, because while Rumble views it as a zero-sum game of competition between Piltover and Bandle City, Piltover has a less rivalrous frame of understanding.\n\nThis story is still developing, but I think the idea with having Azir and Xerath both on the Shuriman lineup is that, well, as much as Xerath might dislike Azir, he'd rather see Azir/Nasus/etc. running Shurima than those barbarians from Noxus or Piltover. Further, Azir has things that Xerath wants, like access to Shuriman magic that might help him pry his shackles a little looser. Finally, if Xerath's scowling from the outside, he can't do a whole lot to shape what this new Shurima looks like, but if he makes a deal with Azir, he can get into the inner circle and exercise more control, using his sorely needed assistance as a bargaining chip.","replies":[{"poster":"MrBuffington","date":"2015-06-04T01:31:24.518+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"You know, I've been seeing a lot of Faction posts on Boards over the year or so I've been on Boards; I supported the project since I thought it was a cool community project but never really looked into it; I didn't realize how involved the lore you all create was.
