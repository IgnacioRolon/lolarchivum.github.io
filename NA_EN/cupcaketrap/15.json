The problem isn&#039;t that Veigar is strong or weak. Veigar was always kind of weak, but people played him because he was fun. New Veigar may well be stronger, but he&#039;s also much less interesting.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental problem of new Veigar is that his abilities no longer have any meaningful interactions. I don&#039;t mean hackneyed &quot;new style&quot; interactions like, &quot;Q applies stacks of X, and W consumes stacks of X to empower R&quot;. I mean natural, old-style interactions. For instance, Veigar&#039;s old stun, if landed, rewarded Veigar by letting him land Dark Matter and deal extra damage.\r\n\r\nNew Veigar&#039;s abilities simply don&#039;t interact in any meaningful way. Yes, it&#039;s true, the new ragecage will set up a meteor hit&mdash;but it&#039;s not clear how anyone gets stunned by his new ragecage, which is now more of a zoning skill, unless the batteries in their mouse run out or they go afk while standing still. The new ragecage doesn&#039;t have that frustrating &quot;hit with the edge and insta-stun&quot; mechanic, which is itself a good change, but the problem is that now it relies upon the enemy being a complete idiot (or just unfamiliar with Veigar) to get stunned. That&#039;s bad design, IMO. Getting stunned is a big deal, and it shouldn&#039;t feel like a random accident.\r\n\r\nSo while I&#039;m glad they&#039;re giving Veigar some attention, I think the focus should be less on him being powerful and more on him being interesting. There are tons of Champions stronger than Veigar, but I don&#039;t play them, because they&#039;re not interesting to me. Veigar&#039;s slated to become one of them.\r\n\r\n# A suggestion, to keep it constructive\r\nFor example, take Dark Matter. Reducing the delay makes it more reliable as a damage tool. It doesn&#039;t make it more interesting&mdash;just more powerful.\r\n\r\nI&#039;d rather see something like keeping the old delay, but adding a knockback away from the impact site, allowing Veigar to use it to knock people into the walls of Event Horizon and stun them. A stun via Dark Matter **would** feel satisfying and &quot;earned&quot;/&quot;deserved&quot;.\r\n\r\nAnyway. My main point: I care about Veigar being fun and interesting much more than I care about him being &quot;strong&quot;.","replies":[{"poster":"A Superb Villain","date":"2015-09-19T20:07:36.676+0000","up_votes":22,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just think there is too much power invested in Event Horizon, your success in-game relies on whether or not it is used efficiently.

What you seem to be missing, however, is how pre-rework, virtually his ENTIRE kit revolved around that stun, since nobody competent is going to let you walk up to them, q, then simply walk away.  \nSince the assassin meta, his q being such a short-range poke was abysmal given his weak identity and early game.  Early on, you had 3 options, Sit at tower and scrape whatever cs you could get.  Walk up the lane, e>w>q your opponent and be nearly oom with everything on cooldown, or, as you state, walk up, hit them with q, then proceed to get chunked/killed by your enemy midlaner.\n\nPre-rework, instant stun or not, both his q(for harass) AND w relied on that stun.

'Oh, you want to dive me? Get past the ring of death.' 'Oh, you wanted to run down that jungle path? Burn flash or walk back towards me.' It's an effective trap; a cage meant to be dropped on your enemys when it's most inconvenient for them. When used beyond that then yeah, they can spam the dance emote within it's confines for all I care.\n\nAside from that it is true that veigar's kit lacks a lot of interaction, but being the iconic burst mage that he is is just where so much of his power is. To give him the w knock around skill or any changes like that would result in a nerf to his damage, something that defines him. I don't know about you, but nothing in my opinion is sweeter than one shoting the enemy mage with your ult. \n\nDELETE!{{champion:45}}","replies":[{"poster":"Diet Olive","date":"2015-09-20T14:52:51.035+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Question...are there any good video guides for veigar?

Level your q first, use your q to farm and poke. Get some mana regen for more q's. Save  your w for zoning (you can deny the cannon minion sometimes if you time it right), and keep e on hand for either a kill, or escaping ganks. When positioned right your e can save you even when a bit over extended, though I can't explain it well without a video or pictures. \n\nA lot of Veigar is knowing your power curve and capabilities. Early game, focus on q and be passive farming. After your q starts to hurt, use it to poke as well as farm (it can go through one minion to hit your enemy). From then, be safe and smart since you are fragile and immobile. Eventually your full combo can decimate anyone who hasn't built tanky, but your q's hurt enough that if you're safe you can whittle down anyone. Finally, watch your mana. Try to always keep enough for your e at the very least.\n\nThat's a very meh guide, but I hope it;s at least a little helpful.","replies":[{"poster":"Diet Olive","date":"2016-06-10T06:08:34.696+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i know i am late, but thank you for taking the time for giving that advice. :D","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"stuartk11","date":"2015-09-19T21:32:13.610+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"This quite accurately describes the problems that Veigar has. There is now little synergy in abilities. The advantage that Veigar has over his opponents will usually lie in his Event Horizon's ability to disrupt a team-fight, and his ultimate's ability to burst down a target when engaged in a 1v1. I find that the changes to Event Horizon make Veigar incredibly weak early in the game, but people will only focus on its maximum potential, and describe it as its **only **potential.","replies":[{"poster":"Reazale","date":"2015-09-19T23:57:19.218+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":4,"body":"The actual incarnation of Veigar has one of the most boring playstyles out there:\n* U dont want to fight ur laner in 90% or more of ur matchups , u just want to farm... he is worse than nasus (who at least can fight after min 6 against some of their matchups)\n* To kill ur enemy they must outplay themselves and step into the stun willinly\n* He cant 1v1 unless he can QR for a kill (if his enemys are competent), he is a solo laner that cant get kills be himself unless the enemy fucks up really badly ( by stunning themselves or allowing Veigar to farm a lot and not building any items to defend against his burst)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Trundle Bundle","date":"2015-09-19T21:30:35.699+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":1,"body":"Honestly, Doom Bots made me feel like a change to Dark Matter would give Veigar a ton more presence without necessarily adding to his single target burst. Specifically, seeing the multiple DM's falling down was terrifying, the sound was crazy, and it really made you worry about moving to the right position.\n\nObviously I'm not saying he needs to have a wave of full strength Dark Matters hit around him at a huge radius, but what if the skill was broken down into 3 casts per spell activation? You now have the opportunity to stagger the 3 casts of the spell out over the traditional delay on the spell, and they'll all still fall at once when that delay is over. Going with the Zyra flavor of damage regulation, the \"first\" cast to hit a target would cause half of what a dark matter currently does, and additional hits to the same target would hit for a quarter, so they add up to the full value.\n\nMechanically, it would make sense to have any unused charges deploy where you cast your last dark matter, so you'd only have to hit it once to continue to use it like it is on live and wouldn't have to be tremendously afraid of being locked out of the remaining casts. The end result however allows you to choose whether or not you want a very focused burst at a risk, a staggered AoE that's likely to cause more damage to multiple targets but less to targets individually, or try to lead a target into your other spells or hazards from the rest of your team. It doesn't just give Veigar a little bit more decision making, but it makes him visually more impressive and a bit more foreboding. You can't be exactly sure how many dark matter's are going to fall, and if there's only two showing up which one's the double?","replies":[{"poster":"The Soulforged","date":"2015-09-19T23:43:04.115+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Add dark matter ammo system :D\nI actually would be ok with something like that.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"The Yetii Rider","date":"2015-09-19T20:50:57.704+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think you're missing the point of Event Horizon.
