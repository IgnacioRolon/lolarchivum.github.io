Until a few months ago, I was extremely pleased by this decision. It got me out of writer&#039;s block, because the lightness and, well, derpiness of the League universe melted away my anxiety about writing: \"come on, it&#039;s a story about freaking LEAGUE lore, just write, it&#039;s fine\". It connected me with a community of other lore fans. And hey, people actually read what I wrote, and said they enjoyed it, so I like to think that I wasn&#039;t the only one who benefited from this decision. It meant a lot of jokes from my friends about working two full-time jobs, but I felt it was worthwhile.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/v310XA7.jpg\n*Pictured: A Zaunite techno-Summoner, 333lom, preventing conflict and constraining characters.  Look at her! Art by [333lom](http://ikleyvey.deviantart.com/), a community member.*\n\nI am far from the only one.\n\n# Was it a mistake? It might have been.\nhttp://i.imgur.com/8WXE9Sb.jpg\n*I sometimes prefer to think that Riot is genuinely ignorant of how much its community has invested in its lore.*\n\nI think I&#039;m still glad that I chose to get invested, but suddenly, I have real reservations. I&#039;ve spent a ton of time exploring and developing a world that has now several times been retconned and reworked beyond recognition. Riot was always kind of mercurial about lore, redoing Champ backgrounds and such, but nothing like this. There&#039;s sort of an implicit understanding between a universe&#039;s authors and the community, implicit within the invitation to get immersed, that the fantasy walls will hold, even if some furniture gets moved around. Here, Riot doesn&#039;t seem to hesitate before sledgehammering major pieces of its setting.\n\nI don&#039;t know why they&#039;re doing this. My lead theory is that they want to make more Runeterra games, and consider themselves to be back in the \"blank slate\" stage.\n\nWhatever their rationale, clearly they think it outweighs the decimation of the lore community and their (our) years of investment into the setting. I&#039;m not quite saying I want to go back in time and take back my decision to start **[Factions](http://LeagueFactions.net)** or read **[the Journal of Justice](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Category:The_Journal_of_Justice_Issues)**. I&#039;m just saying that the stress and anxiety that those decisions have brought me are serious enough that it&#039;s not any easy call.\n\n# The Great Retcon was just the first punch.\nhttp://i.imgur.com/VwNfxO6.jpg\n*Garen (constrained horribly by Summoners) strikes through the Great Barrier, clearing the path for a Demacian assault on Shurima, triggering an international crisis. This will stop making sense when they release the new map and there is no Great Barrier between Demacia and Shurima.*\n\nRetcons are about the worst thing you can do to a community. There&#039;s nothing that breaks immersion or invalidates prior community creations quite the way retcons do, especially sweeping retcons.\n\nLet&#039;s take a brief inventory of Riot&#039;s larger retcons:\n\n* **The League of Legends.** Riot retconned the League of Legends from the lore of League of Legends. Let that sink in.\n* **Summoners.** Riot also retconned us out of the universe.\n* **The layout of Valoran.** Though they haven&#039;t released a replacement map, they have said that the current map is no longer canon. After retconning the League, and Summoners, this was about the most continuity-breaking retcon they could pull.\n\nWe no longer have a connection between the game and the storyverse. We no longer have a presence in the universe. And we no longer even know what the world looks like.\n\nSo place your bets: is this the last \"last time\"? Or are they going to keep their serial retcons coming? Have they written off the League universe? Are they just trying to bang together a marketable Runeterra setting?\n\n# The retcons aren't just killing the community. They're killing the heart of the lore.\nhttp://i.imgur.com/xh7eul8.jpg\n*More art by 333lom. It shows a yordle scientist at the moment of her great breakthrough at Piltover Academy, which may or may not exist tomorrow.*\n\nMaybe Riot's giving up on having a story for League, and is banking on a new media empire with this Leagueless Runeterra at its center. Even if that&#039;s their goal, I would question their decision: what a setting needs is a certain magic, a certain internal chemistry. I think, for all its faults, the old League universe had that. This new League universe? It&#039;s pretty hollow. It&#039;s overproduced and hollow. It does everything just right, hits all the authorial buzzwords and media reqs, but it has no heart. It&#039;s like a Hollywood movie: the product of a truly painful volume of highly paid talent, gone over a thousand times with fine-toothed combs looking for any hints of a \"mistake\", venturing nothing, risking nothing, surprising no one, inspiring no one.\n\nIf I&#039;d started League a couple weeks ago, I&#039;m pretty sure I&#039;d never have started writing League stories or becoming invested in the universe. I&#039;m fairly certain I&#039;d never have started Factions. There&#039;s nothing here that inspires. Nothing novel or interesting. Just a bunch of well-produced intro-marketing pieces for new Champions and skins.\n\nThe original League universe was stupid as hell sometimes, but it caught the eye. I mean, a fantasy UN created to prevent the world&#039;s destruction through magical WMDs, an interconnected fantasy universe with newspapers and ray guns and knights all crashing together into one surreal metropolis: these are eye-catching ideas. The new Runeterra? \"Here&#039;s Ekko. He is from a place called Zaun. It&#039;s basically Shadowrun with some extra mutants. Now watch him exercise his agency to confront a difficult challenge and emerge from the experience having grown as a person.\" It is absolutely the way to write a character story.  It is *correct.* It is *professional.* It is *dull as hell.* The original characters in League didn't have such well-produced backstories; their backstories were crazy grab-bags of random events and flashes of personality. But the idea of all these characters, most of whom were ripped off from one place or another, joining the League together and meeting one another? Whoa. That's kind of a neat idea. What if a frontier sheriff and an Arthurian knight ended up crossing paths? *I can work with this.* No individual faction in Runeterra is particularly interesting, either; they&#039;re all rehashes of standard fantasy tropes. But putting them all together on one planet? That&#039;s pretty freaking interesting. That gets my attention. I can write stories about that. That&#039;s fun.\n\nThe new Leagueless Runeterra? You can&#039;t say it&#039;s *bad* as such. You kind of have to agree it&#039;s *good*. But it&#039;s not inspiring. It&#039;s got no soul. It&#039;s too freaking careful for a soul. There are no derpy gaps or plot holes within which a quirky kind of magic can develop. It&#039;s all hammered-down, tightly-sealed \"product\". Even if all Riot wants to do is start stamping out more games, books, movies, and merch, this new Runeterra doesn&#039;t have the heart to sustain it.\n\nI'm reminded of what I think may serve as a cautionary tale: Wars TCG. It was a customizable card game, like Magic. It was created by the same people who did the awesome original Star Wars CCG. They lost their Star Wars license, so they made their own setting. It was filled with art, music, lore. Much of it was quite high-quality. They really broke the bank. And it failed, not least because, although everything was done right, *you cannot reliably create magic.* Sometimes a setting springs to life. Sometimes it doesn't. It's perhaps also not unlike the Star Wars prequels compared to the original trilogy. It's hard to predict whether a creative work will really take off and thrive, but inasmuch as these things have rules, one rule seems to be that derpy, slapped-together, somewhat frantically constructed settings have a higher likelihood of coming to life than overproduced Hollywood ones. George Lucas running around with a handful of underpaid crew members going \"OH MAN WE HAVE LIKE FOUR WEEKS LEFT SOMEONE GET ME SOME BATTLESHIP MODEL KITS AND A SHINY METAL ROBOT SUIT OH FORGET IT LET'S JUST REMAKE A KUROSAWA MOVIE WITH LASERS\" in the desert produced something magical and memorable. George Lucas sipping coffee in front of computer screens, surrounded by hundreds of millions of dollars of technology, talent, and shiny-eyed staff eager to pour all their hard work into making one tiny piece of this project absolutely perfect produced something eminently forgettable.\n\nhttp://40.media.tumblr.com/126717f6169a5f5c0b078e69fa62a099/tumblr_mngeu7Ng0Z1rwthleo1_1280.png\n*Another heartfelt piece of community art broken by Riot's casual blank-slate retcon. From [Becoming a Summoner](http://becoming-a-summoner.tumblr.com/).*\n\nThe original League lore was smacked together on a tight timeline with a primary objective of \"give this game a story\". That's an awkward, difficult task. And it brought out some crazy leaps of creativity. Slapping down totally standard, and (with all due respect) not terribly well-executed fantasy tropes onto this rocky, bumpy, awkward foundation produced some remarkable innovations, by necessity. It also produced some cracks and gaps which needed filling. An engaged, enchanted community is very willing to pour its love out to fill in those little imperfections. (Again, Star Wars: it's full of half-built allusions and apparent contradictions, which have been embraced by the community and transformed from mistakes into gems. \"A Kessel Run in 12 parsecs? Let's figure out why that could possibly make sense. Hey, what if there's a big black hole?\") But now Riot's ripping up that rocky foundation, sanding it smooth, and pouring sparkly shiny product on top. Naively, one might think that removing the awkwardness will make it better; take out the strange and leave the good. But it doesn't work like that. It's a living, interconnected thing.\n\nRiot's like Johnny 5 trying to \"RE-ASSEMBLE\" the butterfly or grasshopper or whatever it was. You can't smash a living thing to pieces and then put it back together, expecting it to return to life. Complex organic systems don't work like that. Re-rolling your setting is a really risky move. The old Runeterra had some kind of spark of life. Riot's pulling a Wars TCG now. There's some chance that new Runeterra will develop its own spark, but the odds don't look that good.\n\n# The diehards are dying. This should concern Riot.\nhttp://static.tumblr.com/aidcuae/7JXm48ntx/lileyx_chan_comission_by_gladosy-d472gtt2_copy.gif\n*More community art broken by Riot. This example from the [Becoming a Summoner site](http://becoming-a-summoner.tumblr.com/).*\n\nAnyone who has stuck with Riot&#039;s loreverse for this long is pretty crazily dedicated. When *we* start saying \"screw this, I wish I&#039;d never cared about your stupid universe\", that should be a cause for concern. I&#039;m pretty sure the top-level people think about chroma packs and such about a thousand times more often than they think about lore. Riot as a company seems to still have an \"oh yeah, there&#039;s lore or something, right?\" attitude. But I think we&#039;re finally at the point where even the diehards are, well, dying. If there&#039;s a time for Riot to have some serious qualms about what it&#039;s doing with its storyverse, I think it&#039;s now.\n\nIf Riot wanted to be decent about this, they would have, perhaps years ago, published a simple letter stating that they were closing the League universe and making a new one. Stringing us along like this was a dick move. To be honest, the main thing that keeps me going is sheer bloody-mindedness, mixed with a not inconsiderable amount of anger. I&#039;m not sure how much longer that will last.\n\nThat's where I am. I am saying that I'm going to sneak off in my little bits of free time to write fanfic based on the old Runeterra **[with some other diehards who don't want to die just yet.](http://leaguefactions.net/2014/09/04/riots-lore-retcon-and-factions/)** Underneath it all is the truly insane belief that there's enough magic in the old Runeterra that this scrappy band can produce better, more compelling lore than whatever the giant clanking Riot machine can churn out. Understaffed by a thousandfold, underqualified beyond comparison, underfunded by an essentially infinite multiplier, *but we think there's something special in old Runeterra and we think that can be enough.* We're going to take the stone they rejected, the League, and make it our cornerstone. This is certifiably stupid. It isn't going to work. I can't see how it can end but badly for us, and yet I also can't see a way to make myself not want to do it. Let's at least go out tilting at windmills.","replies":[{"poster":"CupcakeTrap","date":"2015-06-01T10:23:58.760+0000","up_votes":38,"down_votes":3,"body":"I was feeling pretty bitter, fatalistic even, after writing this post.

I don't want to start questioning the elements that are very personal to his motivation for doing the work he has done.\n\nI can talk specifically about a few points.\n\nCupcake is absolutely right in his frustration that we have not replaced certain things that we appear to have taken off the table.\nSummoners have not been taken out completely, but they are different to what they were (they're not tied to the IoW, they can't be the same). Saying that doesn't help, it's one of the things we haven't shown you yet, so the frustration is completely understandable.\n\nThe same for the map. We haven't fully fleshed out certain aspects of Valoran and we also haven't told enough stories to reduce the chance that a definitive map would be restrictive. We would be having place define story rather than the other way round. We were very close to releasing a world map that looked so detailed it would have locked us into a definition of the world before we had started properly exploring it.\n\nBefore the \"well, a good writer would know how to work with restrictions,\" argument, this isn't just about the writing, it's about a number of teams, various designs and other things that will have a dramatic impact on the final overall look of Valoran and beyond. Those things aren't ready yet, and putting out a world map that we might have to change rather soon would be problematic.\n\nWe will be releasing the map over time through various artifacts, as seen in the Shurima and Harrowing examples, but we're creating a world built from story and character, we didn't want that defined in a way that could quickly feel arbitrary.\n\nAside from that, I'm not going to exhaustively go through Cupcake's post as I respect his view, his work, and his personal viewpoint. Do I agree with him that the new story we're building is hollow? Not at all. But we haven't shown enough of it to prove that yet.

I appreciate your sensitivity to the fact that this thread is a somewhat emotional and personal one—to put it more bluntly, it was a late-night angst-rant—and may not be the ideal context for a substantive discussion of League lore. This was indeed mostly a personal thread talking about big-picture feelings and themes. It was intentionally a somewhat one-directional thread. I feel like I've been heard.\n\nWhile it was a deeply personal post, I did raise two larger themes. You've commented on them somewhat above.\n\n# Hollowness\nI agree that this is mostly a matter of showing, rather than telling:\n\n> Do I agree with him that the new story we're building is hollow? Not at all. But we haven't shown enough of it to prove that yet. So I understand why it looks that way and the emotion involved in that view. Until we deliver, it's the truth of what you have in front of you.\n\nAnd for what it's worth, I do hope that you are able to flesh out the new Runeterra into a place with as much heart as the old Runeterra. I've shared some thoughts above on my personal view that some willingness to fumble, and some rockiness to work around, are both important for producing a flavorful universe. This might be a good topic for you to discuss with the community in future threads. If I may presume to say this, I feel it's also a conversation that should happen within Riot from time to time. There is a real danger of overproduction, especially when working on a game that originated as a hacked-together Warcraft III mod. That zaniness and slapdash feel are, I think, part of League's core identity at this point.\n\n# Retcons\nI maintain that this is something that needs to be discussed more with the community. This thread may not be the right place for that, but those discussions should happen. I won't deny that there are some ways in which the schism that followed the Great Retcon has been helpful. If you guys didn't feel excited about writing lore that involved the League, then you made the right call to write about something else. There may be a silver lining to leaving that part of League's lore to the community. But in that sense, the Great Retcon was the least damaging of all the retcons, because it was a clean cut. Retcons to established characters and settings continue to be highly problematic.\n\nOn the specific topic of the map, I feel this is another balancing question. You've explained above that the primary reason for leaving it unclear is to maximize future flexibility. There's some value to that. But I hope this thread and others like it have helped to impress upon you that there is a cost to keeping everything undecided for so long. It's a problem for immersion, as well as community creativity, to not be able to print out a map of Runeterra and stick it on the wall. It's all a big question mark right now. And I would further question whether it would really be so constraining for you to at least describe a map in broad, broad terms, e.g., \"Demacia's here. Ionia's over here.\"\n\n# Example: Veigar\nBringing these topics together, I would encourage Foundations and others at Riot to pause rather seriously before taking the axe to an established character or setting. Don't be too quick to judge a given \"old school\" character for being slapdash and amateurish. Take a look at Veigar. He's a fuzzball who went mad from lack of snuggles and became a dark mage. That's kind of a stupid character concept, from a certain point of view. You've got so many talented authors over there that I bet you all could work out a better concept for \"tiny mage with big hat who casts meteor spells and cages people\" in a matter of hours. I really don't doubt it. But this isn't a blank slate. When you overwrite a character like Veigar with a snazzy new concept, however brilliant that new concept might be, you're doing two things:\n\n* First, you're disrupting the cohesion of the universe through a retcon. All prior Veigar artwork and lore becomes incompatible with modern canon. Everything from sad stories of Veigar's imprisonment to LilyPichu's biographical video get tossed by the wayside, or consigned to an alternate reality. Individual players' senses of immersion are compromised. It churns up the foundations of the universe, and drives another crack through the suspension of disbelief that makes a fictional universe feel like a universe. The cold reality is that this is all \"pretend\", and in many ways universe-building is an effort to overcome that reality. Backpedaling and rewriting established lore erodes that carefully constructed appearance of a real world with objective existence.\n* Second, you're stamping out part of League's artistic tradition. I've spoken above about how I value the silliness and amateurishness of League's lore, and how integral I think it is to League's creative identity. Each old-style character you smooth over deprives League of part of its creative inheritance. This is the Johnny 5 problem. Perhaps you could also say that it's the Star Wars Special Edition problem: \"the original had something special to it, but we surely won't compromise that by adding some more CG creatures here, or adding a scream there, and changing the lighting here…and you know, really, Han shouldn't have shot first…\"\n\nGiven those two costs, even if you (e.g.) have a new Veigar idea that seems significantly better in the abstract, or in isolation, it may be better to stop and say, \"hold on, though, guys—what if we kept the silly angry fuzzball lore, with all its strangeness? Can we improve and further develop that concept, rather than starting from scratch?\" I think that, more often than you might imagine, it's possible to improve old concepts without completely replacing them.\n\nAnyway, in closing, I wanted to echo your kind sentiments. I respect your devotion to the task ahead of you, and I hope neither you nor anyone else mistakes our disagreements for profound animosity. (I also hope that my indulgence in some jokes about ***THE ANCIENT WEAPON IS A KEY!!!*** and such are not taken as personal attacks. I do like a lot of the new lore, and as I've written above, I consider fumbles to often be a sign of the kind of adventurous writing that leads to real creative breakthroughs.) I imagine we'll talk more substantively in future threads.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Sneak Dog","date":"2015-06-01T11:55:52.369+0000","up_votes":25,"down_votes":4,"body":">But here's the thing, if you just sit back, give it some time, perhaps things will sort themselves out. \n\n>All in all, I'd say just wait it out, the new lore isn't out yet, lets not jump to conclusions and give it a chance.

Xeraths story in the Shurima event only reconfirms this.\n\nOn top of that, the game is entirely irrelevant to the lore now, intentionally so. The lore doesn't care one little bit about the game. There is no more immersion whatsoever. The game is just a bleak representation of the new lore. It feels hollow to just play the game. \n\nIf I sit back and watch Riot retcon this all, I won't be able to even care about the new lore, no matter how well written.

Personally I view the current lore as part of a book, 1 chapter so far, but you could consider it a complete project. I see your point.\n\nFighting on the rift would make sense, if everyone had a goal that the league could help them accomplish. Nocturne was .. captured? Why's he fighting again? Anivia senses corruption within the ice and uh, the first thing she does is go to League to fight random people.. isn't that a bit weird? Dafuq is Elise doing in the League? I thought she was just trying to eat people.. she actually has time to fight random champions? These are just a few that I've pulled off the top of my head, however, it is beside the point. The idea of them fighting for a reason is great, but the idea of _everyone_ fighting for the league is rather repetitive, and you'd have to limit your creativity and spin up another story about why they're fighting for the League. It's slightly dull after reading 10 of them, not to mention all 100+ champs. Sure some are good, like Kayle and Morg's story, Demacia and Noxus, fit perfectly, but others you can tell are forced into the lore and it doesn't flow.\nAlso as a sidenote, why is Darius Vladimir's enemy? I saw that while going through Vlad's lore... \n\nI'm not asking why is League all powerful, I'm saying that's detrimental to a story. When you have an all powerful entity that regulates everything it limits a story. Overpowered characters can only fight other overpowered characters and it pretty much causes a void in actual plot and narrative. It's just fight scene after fight scene. Only when a character is challenged mentally and physically can they grow. Same goes for League itself. Sure some stories make badass OP characters work, but that's because they actually give them some personality, they give them time and focus, League with it's 100+ champions and summoners and war institute and runemagic would not be able to dedicate the amount of time and love each character needs to be developed within the constraints of the old lore - sure the new lore might have the same issues (for the love of god stop neglecting champions such as Ahri and Brand, and the city Piltover, it doesn't even do anything, it's just there with it's measly 3 champions, they don't even appear in the overarching back story!!) but from what I've seen so far it's too early to make a judgment call.\n\nSure the new lore isn't perfect, I mean Sivir being a decedent of Azir - plz, can you make the plot armor any thicker?- but perhaps it'll fix some issues from the old lore.\n\nI don't see what's wrong with changing a character's back story. If the current lore for a champion isn't working out, then it is time for a change rather than leaving an awkward plot hole. Yeah it does make some fanworks non-canon, but it also gives a chance for the new lore to fix things instead of being limited by the old lore.\n\nI'm going about this all from my perspective that the lore still has much to write about and I personally need to see how they make every piece of the puzzle come together. But stories in general are really subjective, so I accept different view points.","replies":[{"poster":"Sneak Dog","date":"2015-06-01T13:59:49.090+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":3,"body":">Also as a sidenote, why is Darius Vladimir's enemy?

The IoW was too powerful in the JoJ, imprisoned champions weren't interesting, some champions didn't have a lot of motive to be in the public, etc.\n\nIt had potential though, just as Runeterra without IoW has, however the IoW did integrate lore and gameplay, which creates immersion and helps people dive into the lore.

Everyone who plays in the global scene would arrive at the IoW at some point or another. Everyone who didn't, wasn't very important.\nAlso, it was used as the end-note, whereas I'd just consider it a sidenote.

I've been silently watching your threads and upvoting CCT, and now I have to finally express my opinion on this.\n\nThat announcement of the Retcon literally gave me chills. We've been left in the dark for so long, just the known parts of the lore vanishing into the abyss, with only a few plastic sentences to replace them. I call the new lore plastic - because, as you said, it follows a strict scheme of how to make a cool character background, how to make a cool fantasy world, with big budget and technology to make it polished. And I unfortunately, don't like a single bit of the new lore. If there is any.\n\nI believe they are actually making something. They're probably really rewriting the entire Runeterra, and they want to release the final project, complete, because that's how polished companies do. And I believe everything new will be like these things after the retcon - sparkly, overdone and hollow.\n\nI truly believe the Narrative is capable of better, capable of *expanding* the characters, and not just rewriting them into cliche villains, evil monsters and whatnot. But I get the feeling they were given the job of rewriting the lore specifically to fit the audience of twelve-year-olds whose attention cannot hold longer than two sentences. What if Riot figured their playerbase is mainly composed of children who are content with the kind of lore they're making now? I would be very disappointed if this turns out to be the case. But also hopeful, maybe.. they could be convinced to return to the old lore. The kids aren't interested in the lore either way, why write only for them?\n\nThe Runeterra after the Retcon is, what? A generic fantasy land with every faction for themselves? Nobody is aware of anyone. Hey, at least we now *feel* their world is big, so the champions never encounter each other. What? Then why are they on the same planet at all? Why not make separate universes named Freljord, Shurima, etc. Why are they even still called Champions? The League of Legends without the League? Those names were obviously too tied to the franchise to cut them out too, but I think they would do that if they could.\n\nThe lore nerds have spoken. We want the IoW back, we want the Summoners back, and we want the old Runeterra back. Just give the old lore minor adjustments, make the IoW the fantasy UN which struggles to keep the entire planet from breaking apart, rather than overpowered control center. Just like in Factions. Summoners were already perceived as assistants to Champions - even though in the old lore they were more powerful. But that's nothing that can't be tweaked a bit to be what I previously mentioned, nothing that creates horrible boundaries that hold the lore from advancing. \"Oh no, the Institute is preventing us from turning Runeterra into a generic fantasy world!\"\n\nI can't wait to get back to Factions, after these university tests are finally over. Factions literally feel more alive than anything of the new lore ever will - there, Champions interact, the City-states are connected, Summoners are running around *doing* things.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sneak Dog","date":"2015-06-01T12:22:53.430+0000","up_votes":25,"down_votes":3,"body":"Well, one who _should_ be one of Riots greatest advocates in lore if you measured his passion, just made this thread...\n\nI agree though, I don't care about this new lore and why should I?

I know what it means to be patient.).","replies":[{"poster":"Earl Eulrich","date":"2015-06-01T20:37:33.183+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Idk I hate how every champ bio pretty much ~~resulted in~~ started with \"And then they join the League of Legends\"\n\nit´s necessary to link story and gameplay, it´s necessary to be able to tell stories about characters interacting with each other, it´s necessary as a unique setting for the story to take place,...\nit´s ok to tell other stories - but it´s just wasted potential to do so in this medium and with this basis.","replies":[{"poster":"John Berserk","date":"2015-06-01T20:55:43.075+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":5,"body":"I agree, definitely. Them being in the League together, which GAVE them a reason to fight alongside or against one another, DID give them unique ways for the characters to interact with one another, but as Riot said around the time the retcon happened, it feels too restrictive. It could work (DID work) for a lot Champions, but I think they started wanting to make certain types of Champions that just wouldn't work in the League, or their presence wouldn't make any sense within the Institute, or them being stuck in the Institute wouldn't allow them to have more exciting stories to be told.\n\nCould they have made newer Champs since the rework work in the context of the old lore? Probably. Would they have been better for it? Arguable.\n\n______\n\nHere's how I see the two lores (old and new):\n\nThe old lore was easier to work with. It was simple and straightforward. It allowed for many stories to be told in quick succession without too much work being put into it or without the need of too large a budget. It was charming to say the least in its simplicity, very easy to jump in and get into, but ultimately it was restrictive. \n\nThe new lore is much more difficult to work with. It's complicated and open-ended. Stories told within the new narrative style require a TON more work and thought put into them, and require the effort of many more people from many different disciplines compared to before. There's more you can do with it ultimately, it's just taking a while for Riot to get all of what they WANT to do with it to us, and having to sit and wait with nothing in these large gaps between content releases sucks.","replies":[{"poster":"NorthernDruid","date":"2015-06-02T00:04:20.810+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've not seen anything after the retcon which wouldn't work fine before.\n\nThey might have to keep an actual narrative running for their world, and go more in depth on certain champions than others.

She's essentially a clumsy foreshadowing in character form.\n\n\"The old lore means we wouldn't have Bard, Kalista and Rek'sai in the game\" is simply not a very compelling argument to me. I would much sooner subscribe to something like \"The old lore's rigid requirement for characters to have clear ambitions and motivations could potentially challenge champion designers to turn Bard, Kalista and Rek'sai into something more than the character design equivalent of three steaming turds\".","replies":[{"poster":"Darrosh Jewfist","date":"2015-06-02T02:26:08.504+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agreed.
