This event continues the storyline between Miss Fortune and Gangplank, tying together their pre-retcon lore, the aftermath of the battle for Nyroth, and the latest Bilgewater lore from Riot. And of course, this being Factions, actual matches will determine the event's outcome.","url":"http://leaguefactions.net/2015/08/06/bilgewater-event-miss-fortune-versus-gangplank/","image":"https://i1.wp.com/leaguefactions.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/bilgewater-butchers-bridge.jpg?fit=440%2C330"},"up_votes":10,"down_votes":4,"body":"http://i.imgur.com/5J5jZ1q.jpg\n\nAs I&#039;ve said, I really enjoyed Burning Tides. However, I&#039;d like to point out that this is an example of a story that&#039;s not only compatible with League lore having (gasp, hide the children!) a **League of Legends** in it, but a story that gains depth with the presence of the League.\n\nWhether or not you&#039;ve ever participated in Factions before, you&#039;re welcome to come **[sign up for this weekend&#039;s tournament](http://leaguefactions.net/2015/08/06/bilgewater-event-miss-fortune-versus-gangplank/)**, and take part in the battle between Gangplank and Miss Fortune.\n\nOne of the things I liked most about Burning Tides is that it&#039;s so fully backwards-compatible, so to speak, with the lore from before the Great Retcon. This event is in large part our way of formally incorporating Burning Tides into the Factions timeline. As such, discussion of the canonical Burning Tides story and lore from both before and after the retcon is central. This is why I&#039;ve decided to post this in Story & Art: because in addition to inviting people to come join our community, I&#039;d like to ask for any comments you have about how well we&#039;ve captured the essence of the Burning Tides and other Riot lore, and how we might improve upon what we have here.","replies":[{"poster":"CupcakeTrap","date":"2015-08-06T16:58:35.906+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":1,"body":"I imagine some might respond: \"but Burning Tides could NEVER happen with the League. All violence is forbidden on Valoran, especially between Champions, or else ten million all-powerful Summoners will appear out of nowhere and give everyone time out. Seriously, one time, this kid in the far reaches of the Freljord didn't eat his vegetables, and a dozen Champions teleported in to make him.\" (That, or a milder version of the same \"the League prevents all conflict\" idea.) I agree that the pre-Retcon lore **can** be read to support such a notion. However, not being particularly masochistic, I choose to adopt a different, saner reading of prior lore: one that says that the League is not a band of all-powerful puppetmasters, but a tenuously established supranational entity struggling to curb the worst of Runeterra's violence and prevent another Rune War. The League has neither the power nor the mandate to bring world peace to Runeterra, and I imagine you'd get a good (if somewhat contemptuous) laugh out of High Councilor Kolminye if you asked her what she thought of the League breaking up brawls between Champions, of all people.","replies":[{"poster":"Xulsigae","date":"2015-08-06T19:14:29.739+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"It can be read that way...but that would be wrong as there are multiple examples of the League not interfering or being all knowing about events.

It means they get to spread their ideals, their views, on a populace that has no choice but to listen to them. At worst, it causes a rebellion, in which case its just back to square one. Nothing lost. At best, they gain a concrete ally and possibly even an extension of their empire. They have EVERY reason to want to intervene. \n\nMain point being, so long as Champions are involved, then the League has to be considered involved as well. Its the difference between being a Champion of the Institute of War, and just a national hero of their civilization.","replies":[{"poster":"CupcakeTrap","date":"2015-08-07T00:02:33.593+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Narasimha,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=xA0yEE3J,comment-id=000000000000000100010000,timestamp=2015-08-06T23:42:35.268+0000)\n>\n> Because it sets precedent.

And, not that any of us wish ill for Ashe, but what if she did go through with it? What if Sejuani killed Ashe and seized control of the Freljord? Why would the Council rush to the defense of a dead person, in opposition to the new ruler of a member-state?\n\nBoram Darkwill ruled Noxus and represented it before the League, and then Swain killed him and took his place. Swain might have gotten some wary looks in the halls of the Institute, but I don't think the Council had much to say to him other than, \"So, do you want some interns to help you clean out Darkwill's office?\" It was a Noxian Champion who offed a Noxian leader and become the new Noxian leader. I think that this might actually be one of the situations in which it would be **least** likely that the League would do anything.\n\nI think Talon killing Jarvan IV would absolutely be illegal under League law, and absolutely would (from a legal perspective) expose Talon to liability for punishment…but the political environment that would surround a Noxian assassin killing the Crown Prince of Demacia would make all of that completely irrelevant. I can imagine a Summoner running to the Council, trying to bring a motion to sanction Talon, and being told, \"Are you completely insane? Come on, we're going down to the Heart of Gold; might as well get plastered, because Runeterra's going to be a smoking cinder in a week.\" More seriously, I think that in such a situation the League would be desperately trying to prevent an impending apocalypse, not trying to punish Talon—especially because any action taken against Talon would be taken as a sign of the League taking sides, and becoming another combatant in a new Rune War.\n\n---\n\nSo when *would* the League care? Well, for starters, I think the League is pretty firm about no fighting on the grounds of the Institute. That's a problem for the integrity of the Institute, and besides, nobody wants superpowered Champions brawling on top of the largest collection of arcane artifacts in Valoran.\n\nAlso, upon reflection, I have to agree with you that a Champion killing another Champion likely is an offense under the laws of the League. For example, let's say Draven gets pissed off at Fizz and lops his head off in a bar in Zaun. Presumably, Bilgewater is going to be upset about that, and is going to push for action to be taken against Draven. I think they'd have a strong position, especially if Draven had no better explanation than \"he annoyed me.\" How that would play out would, I think, depend significantly on how proactive Bilgewater would be about pushing for sanctions, and to what extent Swain would be willing to intervene on Draven's behalf.\n\nIn the case of Miss Fortune killing Gangplank, though, you don't even have an international element: you've got a Bilgewater Champion killing another Bilgewater Champion. I see your point, that one could argue that she just jeopardized Valoran by starting civil strife within Bilgewater, but I also think it's a pretty tenuous claim that would be very tough to get traction on. As long as it stays within Bilgewater's borders, I think Miss Fortune's got a pretty strong \"None of your damn business\" argument.\n\nSo, if Gangplank wins this weekend, can Gangplank press for sanctions on Miss Fortune? I guess he could, yeah. If he did, I'm not sure what the outcome would be; it'd probably depend on, e.g., what kind of argument Miss Fortune could make in her defense. But backing up a step, **would** he? It's a personal score that he doubtless plans to settle with her personally. I don't know if Gangplank would want his first action as Pirate King of Bilgewater to be asking the League to punish Miss Fortune for almost killing him. Might make him seem kind of weak, you know? Seems like the sort of thing he'd want to take care of himself.\n\nIs it going to be awkward explaining why neither of them finishes the job and kills the other? Sure, but that's not a problem with the League: that's a problem with any story that centers around two characters who are hellbent on killing each other. The default solution, in either setting, is to have them keep trying to kill each other but not succeed. Alternatively, we could come up with some reason why they'd back off.","replies":[{"poster":"Narasimha","date":"2015-08-07T18:43:07.553+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think what this boils down to is how we view the League.

They want to stop situations BEFORE they become situations. Even a butterfly can start a hurricane.

And Champions fighting anytime, anywhere should head that list. These are beings of great power and charisma.

I think the League is a much more interesting story element when it's struggling for legitimacy, trying to fight what seems to be Runeterra's fate.\n\nAs for its motivations, I think it's important to consider that the League is not a monolithic entity. It's an institution made up of a variety of actors with a variety of agendas. If we're talking about the League's Summoners and the Council, then I think there probably are a lot of \"idealists\" who are genuinely committed to the good of Valoran as a whole. And I do think that those people in particular would be unhappy to hear about Champions slugging it out, or civil wars starting within factions, or other such events.\n\nAs for how they'd go about responding, I think that's a more nuanced question. For example, I think you could craft a great story about the League trying to get control of a potentially explosive situation through covert action, backroom diplomacy, and so on. One reason I like the Summoner concept so much is that it seems tailor-made for creating fun tabletop-style adventures. \"Summoner Narasimha. If anyone asks, this meeting never happened. You and your team are being dispatched to Bilgewater, to the Marai capital. Ostensibly, your mission will be to investigate reports of abyssal creatures who have developed resistance to the moonstone's aura. We're sending **you** because we have reason to believe that Gangplank has hired an assassin to murder the Marai royal family and frame the Kinkou. This could trigger an all-out war between Bilgewater and Ionia.\" Or whatever; that's kind of a sucky example, but still, that **sort** of plot is one that I find pretty exciting.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Sneak Dog","date":"2015-08-06T22:14:57.347+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have you read the interview with Shaco?\nYeah... chaos...\n\nPerhaps throwing an entire faction into chaos is a bit different, but I wouldn't make any hasty conclusions.

They're not really \"real\" to begin with, and Valoranians have learned that blowing Cho'gath up only destroys his physical form—he'll soon tear his way back through the dimensions to manifest in Runeterra again, and all kinds of nastiness will follow him through the tear in reality. The best they can do is lock them up in the Institute. And even that's not exactly a perfect solution…all but the dimmest Summoner is vaguely aware that Cho'gath probably *could* bust his way out if he wanted to, begging the question of why he's so happy to stay where he is. You know. In the Institute of War. Linking minds with Summoners. Bringing the most powerful mages in Valoran inside his twisted psyche.\n\n{{champion:31}} ***YOU HAVE STAINS UPON YOUR SOUL! PERFECT…***\n\nWait, sorry, I thought I heard someth-\n\n{{champion:31}} ***YOU WISH THE WORLD YOU KNOW TO END? YESSSSSSSSSS.***\n\n-ing. Um. Where was I. Right. Cho'gath. I'm thinking we shouldn't be-\n\n{{champion:31}} ***SUMMONER! YOUR DARKNESS BECKONS.***\n\n-entirely complacent about the Cho'gath situation. I know, the hex-seals are supposed to hold this time. It's just…he seems awfully *happy* to be here.\n\nI've lampshaded Rek'sai similarly. Not only is she a Void beast who can't be permanently killed, but she's powerfully bound to Shurima itself. Azir and Nasus worked out a way to summon her to the Fields temporarily, giving Shurima some brief respite and draining away some of her power, but the enchantments don't hold for long, and no matter how hard the Summoners try, sooner or later she melts back through reality and reappears in Shurima, somewhat worn out but also extremely pissed off.\n\nThe Leagueless version of Runeterra requires much simpler lampshading: \"she's not dead because she's freaking huge, most Champions don't know she even exists, and those that do aren't seeing the profit angle in fighting her.\" That's a perfectly valid explanation, as well. Which version you prefer is a matter of taste. I enjoy complexity and universes with lots of squirrely, counterintuitive twists and turns, but of course there's also something nice about straightforward stories.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Icestar1186","date":"2015-08-06T19:35:02.217+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Imagine what a lunatic like Miss Fortune might do with an entire magical place setting.

She wants Gangplank out in the open, in the Slaughter Docks, out of his ship (because if she just bombed his ship, he'd probably just throw himself off the board and swim back to the shore), with as many of his men as possible, and ideally with a multitude of people watching him. So how does she go about achieving this? She knows only something super important would get GP out of his ship. So it has to be something dear to him, his status... or one of the treasures he's spent his lifetime gathering. If someone dared steal from him, he would go outside and make an example out of whoever it was, so that works in setting up the scenario MF wants.\n\nBut in order to get an important item stolen, she needs an extremely good thief. Naturally, she hires TF, but TF is _too good_ of a thief, she needs to make sure he gets caught. So, naturally, she tips off Graves. Graves knows him well, would be the only person who could prevent him from escaping with his magic. He'd make sure, unwittingly, that they'd both get caught.\n\nSo far, so good, right? Here's where it gets interesting:\n\n_In a Leagueless universe, Miss Fortune would have to go to almost ridiculous extremes to find out all this about TF and Graves._\n\nIn Factions lore, most people (especially Champions and Summoners) know that TF crossed Graves (though they might not know exactly why), and they know Graves is out for a vengeance. MF, in Factions, knows this without any effort. It's part of Valoran's cultural osmosis. But in a Leagueless universe, MF would've had to have an unbelievable network of agents and informants to tell her all the details of TF and Graves' tempestuous relationship. It's still possible, mind you, it's just less verisimile.\n\nI just thought it was interesting.","replies":[{"poster":"Narasimha","date":"2015-08-07T04:40:57.932+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Just to jump in, just based on what we were given, it almost seems like its common knowledge that Graves and TF used to be buddies, and then TF somehow betrayed him.

That said, my point is that the plan makes the most sense in Factions lore, not that the plan cannot happen or makes no sense in Riot's new lore (only that it's a bit of a stretch for MF).","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Valaran Nara","date":"2015-08-06T17:42:18.061+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh crud.
