Makes me wonder just what Bard is doing then with all his power. At some point a being becomes so powerful or has such a big picture view that it doesn't really care what's happening to mortals and such. He's not omnipotent but still doesn't seem like he would care much about things on Runeterra like people. Just based on what I've seen him do so far, he's either rather callous or indifferent to people's sufferings. \n\nIf he's meant to be neutral or looks at the 'big picture,' there are ways to be so and not be indifferent to 'lesser' beings. I'm looking specifically at the 7 beings of Sandman. Dream and Death are both essentially immortal and immensely powerful and don't really care what people do day to day. However they are still not uncaring about people, doing their jobs with passion and not creating undue suffering by inaction, though Dream can be petulant at times. \nDeath from Discworld does that too. He does his job to be there when things die, but he doesn't simply shove them into the afterlife. \nSo far Bard sounds like he's supposed to be a 'nice' being, but I haven't seen it yet.\nOf course when the next videos come out (and they will...won't they?) and we find out more about him my view might be completely different.\n\nYeah I know that wasn't about Soraka, but felt it was relevant.

In other words, the choices that these humans made were so UNEXPECTEDLY stupid, that a little correction (similar to a patch made by Riot to bring an exploit to an end) was needed.\n\nLike as far as whether Bard can see the future perfectly well, that's an assumption that you are making.  Being able to travel to the future and back is one thing, but your ability to keep memories (a physical attribute) while you travel back and forth in time is another.  Memories, in all likelihood, do not stick with an inter-dimensional being but to the body holding them.","replies":[{"poster":"Xulsigae","date":"2015-03-09T03:55:22.371+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I didn't mean to say there are contradictions in Bard's lore quite yet, only ones I seem to see.

A character's motivations can't just have 'because magic' as a reason unless they agree with the character's personality and such for example.\n\n\nI guess my question to you is: Where do you see 'Magic' as an excuse to issues that arise in the narrative?  Your answer to that could really potentially help those that work on narrative.\n\nYou expose a character such as Bard to a community made up of hundreds of thousands, and the fact that a multitude of questions arise for which a creator may not have a ready answer is real.\n\nMy first reaction to the teaser was that it seemed awesome, but there were enough questionable wordings in the teaser as to create this feeling of foreboding that Riot could be attempting to bite more than it can chew. At the same time, I strongly *wished* for them to be able to pull a character of this magnitude off, or at the very least, to not LITERALLY draw themselves into the living representation of the sage in the Mountain themselves: unwrapping an orb (a spirit, a champion) that they've got zero clue how to use *responsibly*. \n\nSo in a way we all find ourselves being able to experience the cinematic ourselves.  We are Bard, spectating a battle that we cannot possibly take part in from afar.  Imagine Bard's team as the villagers and everyone else that put obstacles to his true concept as Noxus. We are Bard.\n\nYou say: \"I'm waiting for the rest of the lore\" and at the same time you question why Bard sits somewhere spectating instead of intervening.  Isn't it the hope that things will turn out well without your intervention that makes you say: \"I'm waiting for the rest of the lore\"?  Well, perhaps Bard was as unaware that he could intervene sooner as you are unaware that you actually CAN intervene in his narrative.\n\nOnly one thing is for sure, if Riot drops THIS proverbial *ball*, there will be a lot of Bards intervening, and good luck to Cinder thinking those Bards can be banished, because he'll be unable to.\n\nReporting live from the nearest inter-dimensional nexus,\nSydelle","replies":[{"poster":"Xulsigae","date":"2015-03-09T22:02:24.939+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hrm. It's not so much that magic is used yet as an excuse but that it might be. From what the video showed and what Narrative has been telling us, Bard is a very powerful and aloof being concerned with the big picture. All well and good, but he still has to have coherent motivations and actions. To me, a being like that would want to be involved in preventing the need for taking away relics by educating people more about them and such rather than simply reacting to crises when they occur. Also Jaerdan said that he isn't bound to 3 dimensions. That's fine, but what makes him move in 3 dimensions then in the video? If he can move in more than 3 dimensions, that pretty much sounds like he can time travel or teleport. So why not do that to grab all the relics at once or move back in time to prevent them from being used...and all sorts of other questions. Why is Bard limited to 3 dimensions sometimes and others not? Seems like story convenience to me. You give a being so much power that if they used it all the time there would be no conflict, so you have them not use it. Pretty much like the TARDIS in Doctor Who or how Goku in Dragon Ball Z had to be prevented from fighting immediately with sickness or space travel or being dead so he just didn't destroy whatever the foe was.\n\nI'm waiting for the rest of the lore to find out more about his motivations and such. I'm asking questions now based on what powers he's seen to use and the descriptions of him given to us by the Narrative team. \n\nA concern of mine is that a few of the previous champions have been hard to relate to due to them being rather one dimensional and without voices of their own to tell their own stories. Kalista had her own voice(s), but was pretty much so focused on one thing, vengeance, that I couldn't really feel anything about her. Gnar is obviously childish, but he can't say anything for me to relate to. Rek'Sai is just a beast and even harder for me to identify with. \n\nBard has an similar issue to me. He's so 'complex' and above mortals, and lacking a voice as well that I can't connect with him either yet. More lore might fix this and I hope it does, but in the  mean time I don't really feel much for him. It's fine to innovate in champion stories and how to tell them but not all innovations are equally compelling. A godlike being with reasons beyond my understanding is...meh to me as a character. It allows any action he takes to be explained with essentially 'He works in mysterious ways.' 'Why did he not save people in the village?' 'It's beyond your scope of understanding.' \nIf I may be permitted to make a comparison, myths with things like the Norse Gods and other pantheons are more interesting to me than stories about 'God' of the Abrahamic faiths. The reason is that the former are more relatable and lively with lots of things happening with them. They are knowable to us. The latter is rather staid and boring, lacking conflict and being too advanced for us to comprehend, so I don't even try. \n\nBard has a fascinating art style and skill set and music, but I don't like the lack of an understandable voice and a relatable lore so far. I hope this changes as more lore comes out. I really want to know what he thinks and why he can be concerned with saving the big picture but not help people caught up in conflicts.

Bard is a cosmic entity beyond comprehension, Kalista is a force of vengeance, Rek'Sai is a feral beast with no more character than Baron Nashor, Braum is a folkstory character, Thresh is a boogeyman, Amumu is a myth, and so on and so forth.\n\nBut the thing is, you don't really see any of these characters interact with anyone else, much less any other champions, eh? It's all just old people telling stories, things that could be embellished or simply not true (but I guess we have to take their word for it 'cause it's all we've got!). The only times we actually do get to see champions interact, even if only briefly, are during the lore events we get every few years if we're lucky, or during non-canon CG promotional cinematics. \n\nLeague has a roster of over 100 champions. You'd imagine we'd get to see them interact every now and then, outside of what is now allegedly Super Smash Bros.: League Edition.","replies":[{"poster":"ItemsGuy","date":"2015-03-10T13:12:12.014+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd disagree with you about Thresh--while he may end up interacting with more champions in the future (and he has already interacted with Lucian some), the way his character and personality have been set up, he's pretty much just a boogeyman that does evil ghost stuff for the Shadow Isles and likes causing pain; not so much a character who interacts and develops (unless it's to kick off somebody's edgy revenge plot), he's more of a ghost story than anything. \n\nWith Braum, I really want to agree with you there, but the thing here isn't just \"I can see this character interacting with other characters in an interesting way somewhere down the line\"--both him and Thresh have personalities, going by in-game VU, but the way they were written, they don't really seem like living/undead parts of the world and the narrative as much as they feel like stories you tell around campfires, whether in horror or reverence.\n\nIt's a stark contrast from the old lore (which was by no means perfect), where you could see unlikely friendships and rivalries be made and developed, where Blitzcrank could play matchmaker for Rammus, where Amumu could actually be in a situation where he could actually maybe make a friend instead of aimlessly wandering the desert for ever to maybe *possibly* be shoehorned into a future conflict. \n\nWith the removal of the Institute, there is no longer that central hub of champion interaction. Now, everything is limited to geographical proximity or two characters hating each other. You will never see how Nautilus interacts with Azir, because they have no reason to meet. You will never see someone like old Trundle make friends with Soraka, because now there's an entire ocean between them. Anyone who actively wants to destroy the world will never be a part of interesting or compelling character interaction beyond some other champions going \"WE BETTER STOP THIS GUY\" because the world is no longer set up to allow that to happen.\n\nConsidering this is a story about 120+ playable characters that should be capable of being attached to on some level by some portion of the playerbase, it's a bit concerning to see how much effort Narrative is going through to distance these champions from the world they inhabit and each other.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Xulsigae","date":"2015-03-10T00:19:43.285+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think Thresh and Braum are the ones most able to be related to and be characters out of the ones you listed, as Thresh has involvement with the rest of the Shadow Isles and Lucian, while Braum has so much character he just needs more stories with him interacting with other champions to flesh him out. His personality begs for interaction I think. Amumu used to be a very relatable character, but now he's gone all 'mysterious' and 'kill everything around me.'

So apparently, the village sage did have some education about not using it.  What a sage will do, or what any human being will do, with his/her last breath of life may be completely different than how one will behave at full health.  Surely, you've seen many players in the Rift turn back and fight their enemy when death is certain anyway.  So you have all the reasons in the world to believe that the sage and some of its high ranking villagers were educated on the orb, or less they would have just used it when the Noxus army first appeared.\n\nI can't speak to Jaredan's understanding of multiple dimensions other than what I've already stated.

Rioters are bound by the rules of their company.  Likewise, in an imaginary world, Bard would simply be bound by the rules of his celestial plane.  \n\nIn our real world, believers of celestial beings know such beings are bound to respect our free will, and that means that we seek our own fate.  So if we are all mortal, terrestrial beings looking at an imaginary world, it would make the most sense to look at that imaginary world through the terrestrial perspective that celestial beings are bound by rules of their own.

A through understanding of the nature of love, however, acquired through your walk in this life, should make you understand that love binds you to a course of action in which there is no choice - only the right choice.   Now many believe that God is love.  If such a thing is true, then having free will does not make us more like him, because love always chooses love and has no choice but to be love-- in that case, we'd have to come to an understanding that we were deceived.
