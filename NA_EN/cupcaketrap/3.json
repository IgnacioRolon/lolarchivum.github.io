I upvoted it, but it's still buried, so I thought I'd make a new thread.\n\nHere are some ideas for improving the Red Tracker:\n\n* Provide a \"mute this thread\" option, or some other way for users to hide/collapse a particular thread's Red activity.\n* When a Red has posted more than five times to a thread, subsequent entries could be collapsed into a single \"bumpable\" entry.\n* Rioters could have an option to tag their post as \"casual\", so that it wouldn't appear in the Red Tracker by default. That way, Rioters can participate in (e.g.) OK threads, or just randomly share their Nami build and discuss it over the course of dozens of replies. It could also be used to more clearly indicate \"this is just my personal opinion; I don't work on this area.\"\n* You could even have a second tag, for when a Rioter is commenting seriously on a topic within their purview. Maybe this would gain a gold border or something. This would allow users to identify especially important posts.\n\nThis would encourage Reds to post, because they wouldn't have to worry about spamming the Red Tracker.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Sweet","date":"2014-10-03T21:50:34.174+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey CT, fixing the Red Tracker formatting is 100% on our list.

I know you guys don't like to put out information on which you can't promise delivery, but we're here to help.  I promise, if it's worded properly and clear that it's tentative we won't jump down your throats.  \n\nThe main reason I participate on the Boards is that I want to help make the platform/community as awesome as possible, and I know I'm not the only one.  It's a lot more efficient for everyone involved for the community to be able to see which suggestions/complaints are acknowledged and/or being worked on.  It also means that people won't end up having the same comments over and over, and we can focus on other features/feedback on what changes.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CupcakeTrap","date":"2014-10-04T00:33:03.258+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hooray!

Here are some negatives:\n\n* A not-insignificant portion of the community likely enjoys reading every single thing ever said by a Rioter\n* Could make certain posts/certain Rioters look more important than others depending on the topic\n* It's possible to mis-tag a comment, in a situation where Riot views something differently than the community\n* It's a way out in difficult situations; a Rioter could speak seriously about a topic without having to worry about thousands of people reading via the Red Tracker\n* It could actually backfire, making Rioters more reluctant to post because they don't want to get the tagging wrong or mislead players\n\nI'm really just playing devil's advocate here; I think that overall this would be a net positive change.  There are definitely some downsides, but many of them can be resolved:\n\n>* A not-insignificant portion of the community likely enjoys reading every single thing ever said by a Rioter\n\nRetain tagging and leave the current Red Tracker as default, then allow users to toggle between Default/Nested as well as filtering by importance.\n\n>* Could make certain posts/certain Rioters look more important than others depending on the topic\n\nI'm not sure if this really has a resolution.  I'm not even really sure if this is a problem overall.  Hot topics will always tend to have more serious replies, and the things important to the forum community change day to day.  There would likely be a good bit of rotation, and logically speaking we as a community already recognize what's important and what's not.  Tagging would only reinforce that belief and help us connect with Riot and with each other.\n\n>* It's possible to mis-tag a comment, in a situation where Riot views something differently than the community\n\nThis could be a huge problem, but it all comes down to Red Training.  My personal opinion is that this shouldn't be an issue at all with proper training and community involvement, but it is still possible.\n\n>* It's a way out in difficult situations; a Rioter could speak seriously about a topic without having to worry about thousands of people reading via the Red Tracker\n\nThis one is tricky.  On the one hand Rioters should be able to resist the temptation, but on the other it's there and waiting.  If you were a Rioter addressing players on something in a random thread, would you rather speak directly to them or speak to the entire community through their post?  Would you rather have the 50 people watching that thread see your post, or tens of thousands?\n\n>* It could actually backfire, making Rioters more reluctant to post because they don't want to get the tagging wrong or mislead players\n\nThis is a bit pedantic, but essentially it's possible that the additional choice could stifle communication.  It really depends on how we as a community handle mis-tagging; if we jump down Riot's throat every time there's a mistake, this would be a *massive* problem.\n---\nAnyway, that's how I feel about it.

Maybe just a \"mute this thread\" option in the Tracker?\n\nI love what SuperFoxman is doing in terms of interacting with the community, but I'm sure they don't mean to drown out all other Red posts. We need to provide some way for people like Foxman to be active in the community without that side effect.","replies":[{"poster":"Daen","date":"2014-10-02T16:55:06.836+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":">a problem with the status quo\n\nOh, I agree.  I love to question the status quo, because it's almost always interesting what you find when you look for improvement.\n\nI think that allowing the players to customize the Red Tracker is the only feasible way for Riot to handle situations like this.  If they made things like that not appear on the Red Tracker at all, it could be a pretty huge issue with a lot of people.  It could also seem as though Riot is trying to hide certain information or stifle people, which is of course not healthy.","replies":[{"poster":"Gavran","date":"2014-10-02T19:55:05.201+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"The status is not quo.\n\nAppreciate that this thread recognizes what the foxman is doing is cool and fun, but also definitely also felt my share of annoyance that it's made the red tracker incredibly hard to use.\n\nAnd to a lesser extent I've thought that about Lyte smite threads too.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Jamnon","date":"2014-10-05T23:23:38.314+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for pointing me to this thread, Riot Sweet.
