Everyone picks their champs. Game tries to load, but it's just a black screen. After a while it says 'can't connect to server'. I tried reloading the client and rejoining the game 4 times, but couldn't. The whole time I was getting 14ms pinging off of google so it wasn't on my end. Happened to me a couple weeks ago too. As usual, there's no 'official' server issues. So I lose 23 LP for something I had no control over. Sigh.","replies":[{"poster":"Jâshîn","date":"2016-10-12T16:06:29.109+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"same problem","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-11T22:01:52.297+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This black screen is usually caused by a connection problem failing to reach the game server, so it can't download any assets.
