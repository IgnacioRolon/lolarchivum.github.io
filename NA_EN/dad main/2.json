I recommend going over the troubleshooting steps in the [game crash](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes+) guide to resolve any driver or bad game files causing this.

I've actually been punished for this issue, so just relax a bit, cause it's not worth getting punished for a bug. Try your troubleshooting solutions, then test a custom game so that you don't get punished. If I find a fix that works, I'll let you know. Good luck.{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[{"poster":"Dad Main","date":"2016-11-19T21:51:41.911+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks man, It happened to me after i got ddosed if that helps you.","replies":[]}]}]}
