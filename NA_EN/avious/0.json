Red doesn't fit his theme at all. He's supposed to be a scary ghostly demon not a fire golem. The vfx should be recoloured to green. Also, I think that the gatekeeper VFX look too similar to the base vfx. Considering that the skin has no unique joke, taunt, dance, recall or death animations and the vfx are not much different I think Gatekeeper Galio is actually  a 1350 skin, not a legendary one. At least give him his originality back by changing the colours to green... Many players, including myself, paid 1820 RP for the green vfx as well.","replies":[]}
