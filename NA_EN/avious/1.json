For example, Riven is now less benefited from health regen because of her low base HP/5. It is impossible to know every champion's base regens and just knowing what % of this unknown value a champion gets is not useful enough.\r\n\r\nI suggest adding how much that bonus actually is next to the % bonus depending on each champion's base stats.\r\nEg: *+100% base health regeneration (+25 health per 5 seconds)*\r\n\r\nWhat do you think people?","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Reinboom","date":"2014-11-20T12:17:30.989+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":1,"body":"It... already does that.","replies":[{"poster":"disregardable","date":"2014-11-20T13:26:56.060+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"It actually doesn't when you just mouse over the item in lane.
