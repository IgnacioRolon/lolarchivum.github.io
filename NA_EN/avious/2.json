This would make her more consistent (Lore-wise) with the other Freljord Queens ultimates (both of them trap the target(s) in ice) and improve clarity on one of the strongest ultimates in the game, not to mention how cool it would look. Don&#039;t forget how Ashe freezes Warwick with her ultimate in the first LoL cinematic :p\r\n\r\nI know that a VFX change requires some time, but I think that with her rework moving to PBE soon it&#039;s worth going for it. \r\n\r\n[I created another discussion some days ago concerning this change and it actually went quite popular. Feel free to check it out.](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/gf34uOp6-since-ashes-rework-is-near)","replies":[{"poster":"RiotRepertoir","date":"2015-04-28T23:59:58.293+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Avious,\n\nAdding some better effects to Ashe's outdated stuff would indeed be cool, but unfortunately, it's not going to be possible for this update. Ashe actually wasn't really a planned project at all, but when a small amount of Champion Update bandwidth presented itself, we hopped on the opportunity to provide a short and sweet touch-up on Ashe. Unfortunately, as I mentioned, the amount of bandwidth was indeed very small, so we won't be able to do a full suite of new effects.","replies":[{"poster":"Avious","date":"2015-04-29T00:08:06.482+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That is sad to know...

When the gold on kill was scaling from 1 to 5 it was a way to make easy money, but it still made you significantly weaker in lane. Nothing new here. Would like to know about your thoughts on my suggestion tho.","replies":[]}]}]}
