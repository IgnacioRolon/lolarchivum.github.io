The boards are already flooded with complaints of how he will be op, or how he will be a troll pick. \r\n\r\nI think speculation/complaints on how broken a champion is going to be are not very productive. That being said, I would like to be able to think about how he might be able to be played. I always have fun doing that with new champs. \r\n\r\nI have a few questions of how some of is abilities work. I realize I could wait until he hits PBE, but I thought I'd ask now anyway.\r\n\r\nPassive:\r\nIt was stated in the comments that chimes are semi-random spawning. Can we see them through the fog, or do we have to randomly stroll upon them? \r\n\r\nQ:\r\nLooks awesome, can't wait.\r\n\r\nW:\r\nI feel like to get an understanding of this, knowing its cooldown/how long they last would be pretty important. Do i have to sit in lane for 3 min to give my adc enough of these to feel comfortable roaming?  Also, can  I use these, or are they just for allied champions? I feel like this is a really important distinction in enabling him to be played anywhere but as a support. \r\n\r\nE:\r\nCool ability, this is one I think I will have to wait and see to get a feel for it..\r\n\r\nR:\r\nIf someone is already zhona's'd when this goes off, does the zhona's prevent the R or does the R persist past the zhonas?\r\n\r\nif anyone else has any quirky interactions that they are curious about with this guy, I'd like to hear them for my own curiosity. \r\n\r\nCan't wait to get a chance to play around with this guy. Looks like a lot of fun.","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2015-02-24T21:30:17.554+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"As the Bard player you'll see Chimes on your minimap when they spawn, regardless of whether they're in fog of war or not.\n\nW has a CD of 12s, you can have a maximum of 3 on the ground at once and they currently last until consumed by an ally or stomped by an enemy.\n\nBard's ult doesn't hit units that are already untargetable (so you can dodge it with Zhonya's, Fizz E, Elise E etc).","replies":[{"poster":"Nebuul","date":"2015-02-24T22:23:52.719+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"What is the maximum length of a bard portal?

Would be highly situational that you'd need to go through the wall to make the play though.\nExample: Anivia and Bard running from 3+ enemies. Anivia walls to keep them away a bit longer, Gnar hops in already in hulk form (so he doesn't get the double hop.) Enemy now has a second to decide to continue chasing. Gnar on wrong side of the wall to get the knockback off, wall will fade or enemies will get away from the wall before he can get to them to use ulti. Bard sends Gnar on a Magical Journey to the other side, wall slams, wall fades, people get rekt.\nYeh, highly unlikely situation.
