","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":81,"down_votes":17,"body":"Let&#039;s be clear, I don&#039;t want sightstone nerfed. As an essential item for supports, nerfing it will make it feel like an even more lackluster item slot, yet it will still be mandatory for the amount of power vision brings to the team even if it&#039;s a painful purchase for the support.\n\nI want it REMOVED. Being the team ward bitch was never a fun part of being a support, losing an item slot and 800 gold on an already cashed starved champion is a kick to face, and it&#039;s just insult to injury that trinkets were stripped of the ability to let non-supports contribute meaningfully to vision.\n\nOnce upon a time, sightstone was a major QoL improvement to supports, who had previously been required to keep a slot open to just to stash all the wards they needed to buy. It simultaneously added some stat functionality so wards felt like less of a personal stat burden, and got rid of the constant gold sink of buying 5 wards every trip to the fountain.\n\nBut then we got trinkets, and suddenly everyone could contribute to vision without sacrificing room in their build. Sightstone was still as strong as ever, so it was still a must for supports, but it meant they weren&#039;t alone in their pursuit of ward coverage. And Heaven forbid, if the support DIDN&#039;T want to lose a slot for sightstone, at level 9 they could keep full ward coverage up, as could everyone else who didn&#039;t op for ward clearing or long range scrying instead.\n\nUnfortunately, the extreme levels of ward coverage both trinkets and sightstone caused meant that aggression was much less effective, so the game became dominated by passive play. The optimal strategy was to stall out any lead you had; vision dominance means never picking fights you could potentially lose. The game revolved around not throwing, around taking objectives without risking a full on fight. Usually this meant sieging turrets  with your ADC, roaming to the next objective as a group if the losing team tries to contest it, never risking any actual engagement. There&#039;s no urgency to push one&#039;s lead when vision prevents your opponents from making any plays that could threaten it.\n\nHigh vision gameplay is really stale, so Riot severely toned down the power of warding trinkets. Where the upgraded green trinket used to keep 3 wards out at once, it&#039;s down to less than 1 until level 18. While I&#039;m glad there&#039;s less vision, I&#039;m not happy that vision is back to primarily a support function. There&#039;s no good reason a support with sightstone should provide more vision than the rest of the team combined. This is exactly what the nerfs to trinkets did, and the removal of green wards means non-supports can&#039;t contribute even if they want to.\n\nI&#039;d like to see the warding coverage sightstone offers spread amongst the team through stronger trinkets, and sightstone itself removed. The strength of vision means sightstone will always be required of supports so as long as it exists, but only at great expense to their power elsewhere. Supports alone are forced to make itemization and play-style sacrifices in order to provide vision for the entire team, and this lost power is one of the largest reasons so many players find them unfulfilling to play.","replies":[{"poster":"KnightsKemplar","date":"2015-12-08T19:09:31.651+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":0,"body":"This should actually be a popular opinion, if people think about it...\n\nIf green wards CAN'T be bought, and yellow trink is buffed a little, you get basically the same ward coverage.

In my opinion, this is the problem with the support role: everyone thinks that a support is a ward dispenser. But it's not true. The job of a support is to help the team with utility, that could be heals, shields or locking down enemies. What separates the supports from the other roles is the fact that their utility doesn't need gold to scale, but makes their job easier.\nOn average there are two supports in a team: one in bot lane, where he duos with the marksman with a low gold income, and one somewhere else, where he is usually a tank with an actual gold income and, more importantly, he is not bound to buy sightstone and wards.\nRemoving this \"warding privilege\" will actually be a good thing, because finally supports in bot lane will stop to be relegated to warding. Warding should not be exclusive to supports.\nAnd if they can't ward while having sweeping lense, well, the solution is simple: they don't ward. They shouldn't be forced to do that. Support doesn't mean warding. Someone else in the team will do it.\nRemoving sightstone is a very good thing. It will lead to buffing the trinkets or adding other ways to give vision.

It should have DIFFERENT tradeoffs.  Cooldowns and the fact that you can have a limited number of trinkets at a time are good starting places.  (Currently 1, but I once proposed 2 trinket slots with more different kinds of trinkets, including pink trinket, and removing buyable pinks too, and I still think that idea could work; maybe next season.)\n\nThe fact that you sometimes have to roam to get vision where you want it will give supports and junglers a slightly different and possibly larger role in vision, but it won't be at the expense of their gold or inventory space.  Those roles will get to spend the gold they earn on things that make them stronger and better at doing what their champion is supposed to do, just like everyone else.\n\nSimultaneously, this solves the problem of ahead in gold -> ahead in vision, a persistent factor contributing to excessive snowballiness, especially at higher elos.\n\nGold already has an important role in the game.  It doesn't need another, especially when the two uses interact so badly.

Sightstone dulls early gameplay by making bot lane too safe from ganks, and removes the interesting choices associated with trinkets by essentially forcing supports to shift their yellow trinket to their main inventory as they pick up the anti-warding trinket. The item was designed to cover the same niche as the current trinket slot, i.e. a constant, gold-independent source of vision, and while it was a blessing to all supports when it was created, it's become increasingly redundant ever since.

It's basically saying \"hey guys, now you need nothing but press '4' to ward, so start warding\"\n\nwasn't it stated in the patch note?","replies":[{"poster":"MealReadytoEat","date":"2015-12-10T00:56:11.711+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Trinket gives less vision always now, even unupgraded, green wards are gone, and sightstone offers fewer and shorter wards.

Yes, you can be more aggressive in lane when high ward coverage would let you see incoming ganks, but at the same time that means no one on their team can pull off aggressive plays like jungle invades or ganks. High ward coverage tends to make each lane an island to anyone without TP or a global ultimate, and the ineffectiveness of helping or receiving help from teammates means it's more important to not fall behind than it is to get ahead, generally resulting in less aggression overall.\n\nHigh ward coverage means it's much harder to lose a lead due to infer","replies":[{"poster":"AMYS GRAVE","date":"2015-12-09T21:47:01.706+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> jungle invades or ganks.\n\non the contrary, if i have high ward coverage i know where their jungler is and can safely invade their jungle or gank/countergank more effectively through knowing where they are.

Thanks for proving my point. \n\n> ganking is near impossible.\n\nIn the laning phase no one had upgraded trinkets, so they had one 30 second ward every 90 seconds which is hardly enough vision to consistently deny ganks. If they were purchasing wards then they were slowing down their item power spikes and that was the tradeoff for purchased wards which is why they were an expression of skill. Knowing how many wards you could afford vs working on your items showed game knowledge. Once level 9 and upgraded trinkets come around the laning phase should be basically over anyway and if you haven't gotten your ganks in by then you weren't going to anyway.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Miku Lv99","date":"2015-12-10T04:46:50.099+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think this is a great idea.  It's lame having to build the same one item every game, and one that leaves you with less combat strength than any other role.  They could just buff trinkets or summoner spells or something so that a team could get enough vision without a sightstone, and not need sightstone.\n\nAlthough, I personally feel like it's the most powerful item in the game, for its price.  I kinda hate playing other roles since I just feel like I can't go anywhere since the enemy is likely hiding somewhere nearby and I'll die.  But with a sightstone, I feel like I can go anywhere as long as there's not some BS champion like Yasuo that can just dash to me and instakill me.

I, for one, really miss CV, but it was dumpstered and then ignored pretty heavily. But something that focuses on vision in a summoner spell could provide enough meaningful tradeoffs that it's not required in every role while also giving the option for people who want it as a focus, while simultaniously leaving itemization untouched.
