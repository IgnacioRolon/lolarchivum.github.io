Honestly this would probably be the best game I've ever played if every champion didn't have mobility. Mobility in this game went from something unique a champion had to something a champion MUST have to be remotely viable. Imagine if my main, Miss Fortune, had a dash. She would skyrocket to pick-or-ban like she was on release since mobility is the part where she sucks so bad at and probably one if not the only things Miss Fortune sucks at, but the fact that mobility is so mandatory is sad. Look at Lucian, he's utter garbage. Low range, trashy poke, none of his abilities do damage until you're really far ahead, and he doesn't do anything any other ADC can't do, HOWEVER he was played in the LCS a ton because of his dash and MS buff.

I think starter champions like Annie should exist in that case of argument but they shouldn't be Tryndamere-tier where low in skill. Not only do these types of champions offer less counterplay but they also offer less ways to outplay you.

His ability to get kited is legendary; a smart Garen will wait until he's targeted with CC to pop Q, but then nothing is stopping more slows from being piled on top of him, completely shutting down his gapclose. Not only that but he brings almost nothing to a teamfight.\n\nI haven't played as many post-rework Garen games as I would like, so I won't comment on how he performs now; but from what I can tell he functions basically the same.\n\nBut seriously, you are so wrong about Garen. Yes, he's a faceroll champion, but that's what he is meant to be. Garen is about brute forcing your way into the enemy's composition, going hard as a motherfucker 24/7. That is his essence, his lifeblood. I don't even give a damn whether or not it's healthy, because the fact is that it's _fun_; it's so refreshing to have a champion that doesn't rely on Korean-tier mechanics or even all that much strategic decision-making, but instead on having the courage to dive balls deep and win through attrition.
