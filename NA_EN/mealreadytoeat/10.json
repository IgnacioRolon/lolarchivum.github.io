Support is a necessary position, like top lane is a necessary position.  You either need to send someone to support somewhere (it honestly shouldn't need to be bot lane) or do something like double jungle with the junglers spending a lot of their time leeching xp in lanes, because there are only 4 gold flows per team.  Supports also come in several different viable varieties, tank, utility/healing, mage, etc.  \"Ranged AD Carry bot lane\" is a much more specific role than \"support\".  An equivalent would be if \"AP assassin jungle\" were mandatory for years.  There is no other case in league where a position has ever been so dominated by one narrow role as the \"ADC\" situation.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"PDE5 Inhib","date":"2016-03-10T18:27:50.216+0000","up_votes":45,"down_votes":6,"body":"I think it's the \"stupid op champs\" meta.
