High and focused sustained damage can, in principle, come from two sources: Low CD, spammable spells and continous damage-over time effects (Cassio, Ryze, Karthus, Anivia to a lesser extent - her focused damage is more bursty) and auto-attacks with their five-factor multiplicative scaling (AD, AS, Crit Chance, Crit Damage, ArPen) - thus, AD auto-attack based champions.\n\n- The second important thing to note is that a build that is based on five synergizing factors is, by necessity, rather strict (it boils down to a more or less mathematical problem with the stats of the items, making additional utility a more secondary concern) and squishy (items have only a limited number of different stats - usually three to four - and any stat not dedicated to offense weakens you exponentially. **This is THE single most impactful drawback of multiplicative scaling.**).\n\n- This factor, squishiness by necessity, is the reason why these kinds of builds are only implemented on ranged champions - simply put, range is its own form of survivability, and a very powerful one at that, too - can't kill what you can't hit (safely).\n\n- Another factor that goes together with the survivability advantage of range lies in the fact that usually, a ranged champion is less level-reliant for survivability, as range does (mostly) not scale with extra levels. This makes ranged champions better for sharing XP than melees.\n\n- Auto-attack improving stats don't scale as hard with levels as tankiness, either (the gold value in tank stats you get per level >> the gold value in damage stats). Same is true for base damages on abilities - you usually need upwards of 50 additional AP (1000 gold) to get the same increase in damage you'd get from an additional level in an ability. These two facts make sharing XP worse for champions depending on their abilities (=mages, including the aforementioned low-CD ones) or needing every bit of tankiness (= all melees).\n\n- However, in contrast to its scaling with XP, auto-attack damage scales superstrong with gold (for example, on most Marksmen champions, a single BF is almost equal to ALL the AD you get from leveling your champion to 18). \n\n- Hence, auto-attack based, ranged champions are better suited for sharing XP, but not gold. The fact that SR features only 4 gold&XP streams for 5 players means that two of them have to share (as it is impossible due to the laws of space and time to share equally between everyone at the same time). And, for the facts explained above, the person that can share his XP without losing out too much is a ranged, auto-attack based champion.\n\n- The additional benefit of having a second champion with a rAABC is that it either enables both to make strong offensive moves (if both champions in question are strong early) or enables the combo to better withstand said offensive moves by their enemies (in case of the rAABC being weaker early).\n\nAll these factors combined result in every team featuring a ranged AD champion that builds offensively.\n\nTL;DR:\nNeed for focused sustained damage, base-stat scaling, SR set-up, resource allocation and basic rules of League's itemization together are responsible for ranged ADCs being the optimal choice for the partner of the support in the duo lane.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Earl Eulrich","date":"2015-08-13T00:45:47.885+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":">What do you guys think?

What is it that makes ranged adcs seemingly irreplaceable to the game? Or, what would it take for them to become less meta or even non meta?\n\nIf I may.\n\nI think Zz'rot Portal is a great step in making a meta where marskmen at bottom lane isn't entirely necessary. It allows characters building full tank to seige towers and take them down really quickly, along with pushing lanes like crazy. It's a powerful late-game tool, but it's not built much, and maybe some details about how you counter it keep it from being an ADC replacement.\n\nMy point is that maybe it's items that we need to give non-marksmen a way to take objectives. Zz'rot Portal was made just for this, so maybe an AP or bruiser item that helped take down towers and monsters would help? Since marksmen already naturally take down towers very quickly, this could be seen as an edge they have and build to account for. Mages and tanks however, can't naturally take objectives as well as marksmen, so giving them strong tools to do the same would balance out the necessity of each class in a way that would make players feel better about their roles.\n\nOne idea I have for mages is a strong AP item with an active ability that scales with AP and can only be cast on towers and monsters. Think of a cross between the Smite summoner spell and Ohmwrecker's active. It would require a really short cooldown (like Ravenous Hydra) to work and to not be castable on champions.\n\nFor tanks, I want to see the changes 5.16 will have on Zz'rot Portal's scalings before I say much else. Besides that, non-jungler tanks may need a way to take down dragons and Barons without giving them extra damage against champions. I'm afraid of this stepping on jungler territory, but still think this is worth considering.\n\nFor bruisers, they might be able to take advantage of 5.16's Zz'rot Portal, but if they can't, maybe letting Ravenous Hydra's active do damage to towers would help too. You have to be right next to the tower anyway when using it, so it wouldn't feel very different.\n\nFinally, for supports, some changes to Banner of Command would benefit them. Maybe make the active more directly about pushing waves and taking towers? It's already a sort of split-pushing and tower taking item, but it doesn't feel good if a lane isn't already pushed like crazy.\n\nThose are my thoughts. I know you get a ton a replies, but I hope a red sees this.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Xela Syab","date":"2015-08-12T23:16:50.096+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RiotRepertoir,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=POqLOqpt,comment-id=000300000003,timestamp=2015-08-12T23:05:02.729+0000)\n>\n> To me, this is a good point, in that when comparing supports over the last few years, we've seen them specialize in _doing_ a lot of different things.

In theory you could also be ok with being bad at siege because you just plan to control the center of the map until you have 5 dragons and a baron and then it doesn't matter how bad your comp is at siege, but in practice the amount of gold turrets are worth in the midgame would make it difficult to succeed with a strategy that deliberately writes them off.  Similarly for \"we're ok with only being able to take turrets if at least 2 of their team are dead so they don't dare defend\" -- it narrows your options too much if you can't get the picks or force teamfights, unless the teamfighting edge you gain for giving up a marksman is implausibly large.","replies":[{"poster":"JedenVojak","date":"2015-08-15T01:56:37.192+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Partholonian,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=POqLOqpt,comment-id=00030000000300160000,timestamp=2015-08-13T22:46:50.954+0000)\n>\n> There's already an item that makes you take 0 turret damage for a few seconds (and your team, too).

For these two reasons primarily, an adc is necessary in a team a majority of the time.  Even if a different form of carry goes bot, an adc is still needed somewhere or they risk not being able to outdamage an enemy adc (there are ways around this, but they're risky).  If more adc-types of champs could solo-lane better, it might be a thing.  Same with if apc's could seige towers better.  Some can.

The shift from poke/sustain to tanky initiators came as a result of a massive nerf of all poke support's base damage in the name of scaling utility, while also increasing tanky supports utility for free (see Thresh gaining offensive and defensive stats for free, Leona losing 10 base defensive stats on W while gaining a scaling that easily refunds the nerf with just basic stats, Braum gaining damage for building HP). As a result of that, Poke supports were unable to push away tanky supports early in the game. This is something that started with Season 4, and is completely intentional. Tanky initiator supports fit this game's philosophy of \"Get the kill, feel good about it\", so the difference in power between the two groups has not been addressed with the same celerity metagolems/poke ADC/Assassins metas have been.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KONO RUBICK DA","date":"2015-08-12T23:21:02.418+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RiotRepertoir,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=POqLOqpt,comment-id=000300000003,timestamp=2015-08-12T23:05:02.729+0000)\n>\n> To me, this is a good point, in that when comparing supports over the last few years, we've seen them specialize in _doing_ a lot of different things.

Try to lane as a melee+support against ranged+support it's impossible. In the black market mode i played more than 100 game with a melee carry, thanks to their items me and my friend we could lane against them as for example master yi+lulu vs tristana+morgana while doing good in team fight thanks to shield+meditate+lulu ulti ect...\n\nin EVERY game we had no problem to push, people says that it's impossible to push without a carry it's totally possible. The AP carry himself was doing so much damage to the tower.\n\nDo ADC make your team push faster? yes\nis it impossible to push without them?
