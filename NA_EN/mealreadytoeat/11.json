Why?","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I made a [post on Reddit ](https://redd.it/3jn03u)detailing why the 65% win rate being claimed for Morde was BS, but I was still wondering why I was seeing a large difference in win rates on various statistics sites.\n\nI finally figured it out; his win rate varies dramatically by region, and some site&#039;s statistics were based off global win rates, while other were based off NA. His global win rate (in all of ranked) is around 51%, while in NA its 53%. \n\n_** In platinum ranked games Morde&#039;s win rate is #3  in NA (~55%) but only #98 in Brazil (~48%), or around #43 (~51%) in the world as a whole.**_  None of the other Juggernauts (or other high win rate champs, as far as I can tell) see much disparity between regions; they are all performing well globally. Why is this?\n\nLook at him on LoLking on [BR](http://www.lolking.net/champions/mordekaiser&region=br&map=sr&queue=1x1&league=platinum#statistics) or [NA](http://www.lolking.net/champions/mordekaiser&region=na&map=sr&queue=1x1&league=platinum#statistics), and OP.gg on [BR ](http://br.op.gg/statistics/champion/)and [NA](http://na.op.gg/statistics/champion/). (You will need to sort by ranked on OP.gg if  you want to see his performance in plat.) Yes, his win rate varies over 7% between regions, and even more between different tiers of play.\n\n Are American&#039;s just bad at dealing with non-meta picks, are they better at playing non-meta picks, is our meta just better for him, some combination of these or something else entirely?\n\nThis is a great point of discussion, I&#039;d love to here what other people think.","replies":[{"poster":"WarlockLaw","date":"2015-09-09T17:10:00.005+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The 65% most likely was coming from champion.gg That site filters out champions by role to more accurately portray win rates. People still haven't fully given up on solo lane morde, which us incredibly weak this patch, which somewhat pulled down morde's overall winrate. The site did initially list adc morde as being at 65% however it has since dropped to 62%\n\nI have no idea how to explain that win rate across regions. My only guess is that each region is trying to do something slightly different and NA is just doing the best.","replies":[{"poster":"MealReadytoEat","date":"2015-09-09T17:45:10.723+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because you didn't click the link, here is the Reddit post -\n\n[Champion.gg states his win rate as ADC is just under 65%](http://champion.gg/champion/Mordekaiser/ADC), but look closely at his % play rate by position -  43.44% ADC and 17.39% Top - only 60.83% games he plays.\n\nThat other 40% of games are primarily one&#039;s he's an ADC, but performs so poorly he has so few items that Champion.gg doesn&#039;t know how to classify him \n\n(edit - it's Riot's API that is assigning these lanes, in part by time spent by location in the game, but clearly by other things as well so as to distinguish between the support and ADC [would like to see a Rioter clarify this], not champion.gg - 40% of his games are still unassigned, so the points still stand.) . \n\nA quick look at [lolking here](http://www.lolking.net/champions/mordekaiser&region=all&map=sr&queue=1x1#statistics) shows that his win rate overall in ranked has been 49-51.5% the past week. Looking at plat elo's like champion.gg is on that graph tells you pretty much the same story as ranked overall, and I can promise you people there know ADC is his only strong role and are picking accordingly.\n\n(Edit 2 - For the record, I think Mordekaiser ADC IS overpowered and some nerfs and power shifting would make him healthier, but he's not game breaking like a 65% win rate would be. This post was about properly interpreting statistics, not his balance.)\n\n(Edit 3 - Thanks RiotJules for [confirming](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/3jn03u/mordekaiser_does_not_have_a_65_win_rate_as_adc/cuqnsqi) that this is whats going on)\n\n(Edit 4 - Holy hell, Morde's win rate varies a ton by region, check out both op.gg and LoLking and compare by regions, 94th highest win rate on OP.GG for plats ranked Brazil, 12th highest win rate in NA)","replies":[{"poster":"WarlockLaw","date":"2015-09-09T18:40:47.509+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Holy shit you got 4 edits on this in an hour?\n\nAnyway had RiotJules not confirmed that I'd have tried to argue that point further. I'd imagine if it were accurately calculated it would still be fairly high. Outside of my friends and I, I have seen more non adc morde's than adc morde's so I imagine that the games are getting thrown out because ppl are still trying support morde.\n\nMorde's ~50% winrate overall is also somewhat misleading as well in terms of his balance because his non adc roles are underpowered and dragging his winrate down","replies":[{"poster":"MealReadytoEat","date":"2015-09-09T19:09:30.301+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also, that was just a copy pasta of the Reddit thread, which played out a few days ago.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MealReadytoEat","date":"2015-09-09T19:08:42.117+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alot of people confirmed it in the thread, including Phreak and a Champion.gg Dev. \n\nCheck out the comments by 0Skydive in the Reddit thread, he got his site working properly with Mordekaiser ADC [here!](https://counterplay.xyz/champion/mordekaiser/adc).\n\n Its around a 55-57% win rate, dropping to around 53.5% in Diamond, which is very close to the 2% higher win rate I calculated he should have as ADC vs his overall win rate.
