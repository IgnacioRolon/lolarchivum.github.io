While this post more or less stands alone, it will make far more sense after reading the first part._\n\nMy first post made 5 main points :\n\n1.  Teams need a marksmen to take contested objectives \n2.  Teams need a marksmen to force their opponents to spend gold and item slots on armor\n3.  Marksmen scale just as strong or stronger with gold as anyone else, but the least with XP, so a Marksmen + support is the ideal duo lane.\n4.  Marksmen are uniquely similar and uninteresting, due to the nature of their strategic purposes and necessity\n5.  All of these detract from making Marksmen fun\n\nNow I&#039;m going to address how each of these is, and could be, addressed in the Marksmen rework.\n____\n**_Teams need a marksmen to take contested objectives._ **- This is mostly about towers and inhibitors. Currently, Marksmen are the only class that can take defended towers, especially when good waveclear makes it too risky for melee champs to attack them. The rework address this in two ways - They increased the AP ratio on auto attacks against structures from .4 to .5, and they shifted Marksman itemization away from AD and AS into crit, effectively making them slightly worse against towers. They also slightly less than doubled tower HP while removing their armor and MR. This change makes the Armor and MR they get while no minions are present more significant (if anything a buff to marksmen), but as pen never worked against towers it's otherwise a completely agnostic change besides the slightly lower effective health - numbers are bigger, but a similar % of their hp.\n\nOverall, these are good changes, but the extra utility and defenses marksmen items now gives will make defensive options less necessary on marksmen, so in the end I think they will end up taking towers as fast or faster. The removal of armor from towers should have happened a long time ago - when something always has the same effective health, it might as well have that as its actual health. Damage against towers is now much clearer - either 100% of your AD, or 100% of your base AD + 50% of your AP. It still punishes hybrid champs, as it only takes into account the higher of 1/2 of your AP, or your bonus AD. \n\nThere&#039;s two other thing I&#039;d like to see to address the monopoly of Marksmen on tower siege; Ohmwrecker becoming a real item for sieging towers, oriented towards mid to late game 5 man dives under towers defended with ranged waveclear, rather than &quot;that item that junglers rush to dive towers early game&quot;, and another AP item with strong function against towers. Nashor&#039;s would be a good candidate. A way to acheive this on Ohmwrecker would be to make the item scale with nearby allies, and freeze the Armor and MR the tower has during its active, so that if supporting minions are killed during its active the tower won't suddenly get 66% damage reduction.\n__________________________________________________________\n\n**_Teams need a marksmen to force their opponents to spend gold and item slots on armor_** - HP can be purchased without seriously harming a champions offensive budget; RoA, Rylai's, Black Cleaver, Mallet, etc, while offensive armor items are left to Zhonya's, and to a lesser extent Sunfire Cape. HP alone is enough to survive the burst of assassin, or CD gated combo from most bruiser and fighters, yet the high sustained damage of marksmen forced large chunks of the champion pool to build some form of armor. This in turn enabled magic damage based champions to remain effective, especially against champions with a large defense budget (tanks).\n\nJuggernauts, including the likes of Olaf, have actually addressed this fairly well.  Melee carries can't typically fill this role, as squishy melees have much greater vulnerability and lower reliability. Coordination and CC is much more valid against a melee than a ranged back liner.  Juggernauts, on the other hand, can survive a reasonable level of CC and focus, while still putting out enough DPS that health stacking can't negate them. Mordkaiser simply works in reverse - he forces the building of MR, as he has high sustained damage and % hp magic damage, enabling AD burst on his team to function.\n\nSome improvements to DPS options for AD assassins and bruisers would help, but the items changes on PBE accomplish this to some extent. Ghostblade will be a much better option for bruisers, while crit builds with a bit of AS will be better for assassins, thanks to two high AD items, as well as trinity force, offering 20% crit. \n\nAmong all the issues with marksmen, this is the one Riot has been doing the best at address. Things aren't perfect, but since 5.16 this alone no longer necessitates marksmen in a team comp.\n_____\n**_Marksmen scale just as strong or stronger with gold as anyone else, but the least with XP, so a Marksmen + Support is the ideal duo lane._ **- This the elephant in the room for the marksmen rework. Marksmen have been given the variety and versatility needed to play outside of bot lane, while nothing has been done to make them less optimal in the duo lane. In fact, they've had their scaling per level reduced even further while their level 1 AD was buffed, making XP even less of an issue. I threw out some idea's on how to fix this[ here.](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/x26pEKX7-support-items-added-a-ton-of-variety-and-balancing-options-why-not-the-same-for-the-farming-carryhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/x26pEKX7-support-items-added-a-ton-of-variety-and-balancing-options-why-not-the-same-for-the-farming-carry)\nRelic shield give 2 gp 10 on the pbe, which makes it a slightly better option for carries bot lane, but ultimately it's nearly as good for marksmen as it is melees. Mordekaiser has a gimmick on his W to get around this, but that's a gimmick, not a systemic or itemization change that would result in real variety. It just got nerfed, and the item changes screw him pretty hard anyway. \n\nUntil this is changed, marksmen will only see play outside of duo lanes when they are overpowered enough that teams can't successfully pick or itemize against multiple marksmen, even after the opportunity cost of what they replaced is paid. At the very least, we need some changes to make melee's either more reliable or more rewarding bot lane, with reliability the healthiest option._ Edit - this has been done to some extent, see part 3._\n____\n**_Marksmen are uniquely similar and uninteresting, due to the nature of their strategic purposes and necessity_ -** The reworks on PBE makes ADC's far more diverse and fun to play. By and large they now have enjoyable game play and diversity. There's now multiple build paths available to each marksmen, and noticeably different builds between marksmen, due to multiple items that give noticeable defenses while still being quite offensive, and good CDR options. \n\nRiot did a fairly good job addressing the monotony of playing ADC's, and the homogeneity between them, without addressing the systemic changes that resulted in them being balanced into the state they are in in the first place.\n___________________\n\n**_All of these detract from making Marksmen fun_** - If I were to give a number, I'd say that riot has dealt with half the balancing issue that have resulted in Marksmen being unfun to play in the first place. They then made them fun, without regard to the remaining balance issues holding them back on live. This is an early iteration of the PBE; I still have high hopes they will begin to address the remaining issue soon. Otherwise, expect a minimum of 4 marksmen a game.\n\n_Part 3, [**What, Why, and How the Preseason Changes the Game**](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/gOYJEpoz-the-state-of-marksmen-part-3-what-why-and-how-the-preseason-changes-the-game-megapost), is up!

Therefore he is technically at a disadvantage when you can keep out of his short range (technically everyone is a disadvantage when you are out of their range).  But being at the edge of his range means you take less damage then being point blank.\n\nNo other marksmen have this issue.  Their damage does not change no matter how close or how far you are as long as it is within their range.  This is annoying when fighting a top lane marksmen as they can just zone away from you easily, or (if they're feeling ballsy) be up close to you when you're at lower health and shoot you in the face.  \n\nTheir ranged damage is supposedly counteracted by their squishiness, but with all the escapes they can pull off (and the fact that auto attacks don't miss) this doesn't feel like much of a sacrifice and it makes fighting one as a melee champion frustrating (Based on my experience with {{champion:82}} bot).  Which makes me wonder what the hell we can put in bot lane besides a marksman and a support?  Two tanks?  \n\nI'm probably just bad at the game, but fighting a marksman when you have no range is one of the most frustrating things I've dealt with in the laning phase.  They can poke safer from their tower, they usually have ways to escape other than {{summoner:4}}, which also makes wasting a {{summoner:4}} more difficult.  Escaping from them is frustrating because you can't avoid their autos (unless you're {{champion:80}} or {{champion:24}} and even then it's limited) so they could kill you in retreat.  \n\nI don't know.  I just don't like fighting marksman/ranged autoattackers in top lane.  Even if {{champion:104}} AA range has been reduced, his AA's now knockback (though he can only fire off two before reloading, so it's counterable in theory).  With a lot of these updates it seems they are allowing for marksmen to be more lane versatile.  Which in all honesty is great for marksmen, but sucks for everyone else.  \n\nPersonally, I wish marksman (with the exception of {{champion:104}} cause that's his shtick) dealt less damage the closer they were to their target.","replies":[{"poster":"Sightless66","date":"2015-11-01T23:42:19.522+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":">Even if Graves's AA range has been reduced, his AA's now knockback\n\nThey only knockback minions and monsters.\n\nIf AD carries dealt less damage while at max range, That would be quite a bit of power lost. You'd have to actually buff them at close ranges to compensate for it, and then you run the risk of making them able to poke a melee champion down while also giving them a better chance of beating the melee champion in a straight fight. There's a reason Graves has base stats comparable to most melee champions now, and it's because he's not expected to lose a straight manfight with them.\n\nIt's also going to be aggressively unfun to play with. The ideal action you want to take as an ADC is kiting, but if you kite too well you won't contribute very well to fights. Not only is that annoying because it messes with your major goal, but it also adds to snowballing. If an ADC is too behind to get in close range to deal higher damage, then they'll also be screwed because they'll be heavily penalized for staying at the safe range.

His autoattacks are only AoE if some of the bullets miss a target, and it's not going to do enough damage that way to make up for the lack of sustained damage that you have from your attack speed being so low. It's not really very good AoE damage if you try to use it that way, and you'll never be at a safe range doing it because your range is so short.\n\nHe's pretty much locked into the \"jump one person and burst them\" aspect. The AoE aspect of his autoattacks is a fallback pattern to stop him from being extremely weak when he makes mistakes or can't go all-in. It doesn't make him good in that situation.

The only thing I don't agree is when you mention not enough Marksman gain much outside of a duo lane.\n\nI will competely agree that a Marksman is ideal as they need items more than levels, BUT the likes of Graves, Quinn, and Varus (Who was played all season mid and even made it into World's as a mid) do scale really well with levels. Graves scales so well with everything that he can even go jungle right now and do one hell of an incredible job while Quinn's new ultimate has put her power budget more into her Q and Harrier. Quinn's new ulti also put her in such a good roaming position that she can compete with TF just because she can do it while his is on CD and even be able to get to the lane he's Ulti'ing to for a counter-gank or clean up. The clean up part especially since her Q now has an execute mechanic. \n\nThe biggest issue though with Bot Lane being ideal for Marksmen isn't their class, it's the fact that out of all the AP's we've had, almost all of them have high bases with limited ratios, so they need levels on TOP of the items. Currently, the only champs who have more ratios than bases are Azir after that Q nerf, Kassadin, and Veigar. \n\nVeigar has high bases, but he'll scale into the late game regardless with just Q farm. I'd say he could go bot pretty easily since his support would be able to keep him alive, but because of Veigar's poor early game and focus on farming, so his passive playstyle would really clash with the heavy aggression that bot lane has become recently. Kassadin is melee who can't do much until 6, so while he doesn't necessarily need levels, he DOES need the first 6 to be of use, which is a lot of time bot lane has to deprive him of any and all gold and experience, plus his passive makes him want to face AP's, not AD's. Azir can go bot currently and does pretty well at it against the less mobile ADCs like Twitch, Sivir, Ashe, and even Cait, but ones who are slippery and can quickly move away from his soldiers like Ez, Vayne, and Kalista would shred him in lane by moving away from the soldiers. \n\nIt's less of Marksman being better and more of being AP's weren't designed to balanced to be at a duo lane.
