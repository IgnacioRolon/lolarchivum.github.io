Both give 40 AD, and effectively cost the same (LDR cost more, but gold income is up about an equal amount), so we can ignore that in our comparison. However, LDR also gives 1.5% damage amplification per 50 hp the target has over you, capping at 15% at 500 hp. Thresh gets that on the new Sight Stone + Targons combo alone.\n\nAssuming Thresh has 90 armor, 16 of which is base, live Last Whisper results in at 90 x .65 = 58.5 effective armor, or 36.9% damage reduction\n\nWith LDR, it is 16 + (74 x .6) = 60.4 effective armor, or 37.7% damage reduction; however, the damage is amplified by 15%, for (1 - (1 - .377) x 1.15) = 28.3% damage reduction. \n\nLDR ends up doing (1 - .283) / (1 - .369) = 13.6% increased damage against Thresh vs the Last Whisper on live.\n\nFor comparison, lets look at Blitz. Lets say he's level 12 for a base AD 63.8, with a glacial shroud (20 armor) and 9 flat armor from his glyphs armor from runes, for a total of 92.8 armor.\n\nLive Last Whisper results in at 92.8 x .65 = 60.3 effective armor, or 37.6% damage reduction\n\nWith LDR, it is 63.8 + (29 x .6) = 81.2 effective armor, or 55.2% damage reduction; however, the damage is amplified by 15%, for (1 - (1 - .552) x 1.15) = 48.5% damage reduction. \n\nLDR ends up doing (1 - .485) / (1 - .376) = 17.5 % LESS damage than of LW on live.\n\nAll this second example really shows is that LW on live is a a great damage multiplier, regardless of if your opponent built armor, while the LDR is only useful if your opponent is stacking armor _**or is Thresh.**_\n\n_Well this post seems to have gotten quite popular.

But that's not including 15% damage amp, so it ends up doing (1 - 0.606)1.15 = 45.2% of the damage to her. Thus it ends up doing about 100*(45.2/43.2) = 104% more damage to her.\n\nFor comparison, a 200 armor Thresh takes 13.2% increased damage.

The armor affects all physical damage amps so in reality, that 15% just turned into 6% after armor. \n\nBut really. ADC's before would have the 6% from masteries and the 35% from LW, which would equate to about 39%. ArP now won't be scaling multiplicative, so the new 7% and the 40% from Lord Dominik's show as additive, as you'll see in game when it's released or you can see it on the PBE like rest of us.

Old LW would do about 40% of ALL armor.

There is something called the Commutativity of Multiplication that says for all real numbers a and b, a*b = b*a. Now I won't give you too much grief if you can't recite it properly, but it's one of 10 Axiom's of Mathematics, so even if you don't know it, you know it. It means that (100*0.4)*1.15 = 1.15*(100*0.4) = 46. Furthermore, to calculate the increase afterwards, we do 100*(46 - 40)/40 = 15%. Amazing, a 15% increase in damage results in a 15% increase of damage, not 6%.\n\n> But really. ADC's before would have the 6% from masteries and the 35% from LW, which would equate to about 39%.

Thus I picked another tanky champ, held armor constant, assumed no other sources of penetration, and everything else was constant.

He'll dead quicker than an AP Sona being caught by a Faker Ahri with DFG.\n\nOk, I didn't look at mid-game (I kind of doubt that Last Whisper will be one of the first 2 items in most cases). Let's change that. Say Vi and Thresh are both level 11 with 100 Armor and that there are no other sources of penetration, and everything else is constant. A level 11 Vi will have 61 base armor and 39 bonus. A Last Whisper reduces this to 65 Armor, or a 39.3% damage reduction. With new last whisper, Vi now will have 84.3 armor, for 45.7% damage reduction. Factoring the LDR damage in, Vi will take 98.9% of the damage she currently does. Thresh on the other hand will have 66.4 Armor, for 39.9% damage reduction, thus taking 113% of the damage he currently does. That's about a 14.6% relative increase over Vi.\n\nOf course, this doesn't look at how often people will buy last whisper mid game. Unless you are under very specific circumstances, I doubt it will happen. Even now, you don't typically see last whisper until a 3rd or 4th item. I don't think we will see the new Last Whisper all that often before the second item.","replies":[{"poster":"Lagrange25","date":"2015-11-03T23:50:00.927+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The commutativity of the multiplication was also my first thought after reading that post ^^\nThanks for knowing your maths :)","replies":[{"poster":"Daedalus871","date":"2015-11-03T23:53:31.012+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for making knowing the order of subgroups of finite groups easier. :)","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"4est Tree","date":"2015-11-03T17:57:32.611+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":5,"body":"Thresh has been a TOP TIER support since his release.

Effectively while another tank would lose 10% eHP thresh can lose 20% eHP if we take 200 armour. \n\nThresh needs nearly 1.5 more  armour to compete with other tank supports for example, Leona (similar kit but more hard cc) \nRiot might make his souls scale differently so it brings him down to 12-15% eHP loss mid-late game and gives him a chance to have the same eHP as everyone else by 50-60 minutes. \n\nWithout this change (even with it) everyone will go back to playing Leona/Blitz again. To be honest, I disliked Laning with these two more than thresh. \n\n","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Shroom Junkie","date":"2015-11-05T17:24:08.583+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Thresh needs it.","replies":[{"poster":"ARequestOfDeath","date":"2015-11-05T22:22:57.438+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"NO HE DOESN'T!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","replies":[{"poster":"Shroom Junkie","date":"2015-11-05T23:09:19.640+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=pokemaster275,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=dPhE5qNE,comment-id=00350000,timestamp=2015-11-05T22:22:57.438+0000)\n>\n> NO HE DOESN'T!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nHe's the top support with some of the best disengage with his lantern, Flay, and ult, natural tankiness through passive not to mention the extra stacked on, engage with his Q, E, and R, poke with his E, and extra damage with his passive.\nHe needs it.","replies":[{"poster":"ARequestOfDeath","date":"2015-11-06T07:25:51.999+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"1st of all he ain't that common in most of my games if there is a thresh in my game it is probably me and i don't play him that much. one of the best if your adc isnt a knucklehead when using your w and for his e makes him stay still for a second and his ultimate can be destroyed by {{item:3009}}  they are reworking a item that will destroy thresh's passive next patch. his engage is ok if you can land your hook but leona does that job way better and the poke is slightly annoying early game but lulu does the job better and his e only op with a certain build which makes you squishy as hell.\n he doesn't need it","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
