Mages are honestly the least of our worries at this point, because it&#039;s not like any lane assassins suck ass at pushing the lane. There are a trillion million reasons why we suck, but mages is not one of them. If Riot actually wants to see us in competitive, here are a few hints.\n\n1. This is the biggest thing. Revert the entire bullshit with Lethality and give us the real Last Whisper back. If you break down the penetration we need into like 20 different items, we will never be fucking playable outside of Intermediate bots. Assassins all need snowballs to be worth anything, and snowballs always mean that we are hogging a large portion of our team&#039;s resources. And, if we have no space for any items aside from raw damage--no dps, no sustain, nothing--then there&#039;s no way for us to live up to the amount of gold being poured into us. When we have pop off games, which is the only situation where we&#039;re useful, we basically take a full item from our teammates, but then our builds can&#039;t allow us to really cash in that extra item. Against players of the same caliber, which is the only kind of players a pro will face, a pure damage build can only down one person before the assassin is also out of commission. Honestly, there&#039;s a reason why LL Stylish is always looking for builds that aren&#039;t lethality, and even Yamikaze--a Challenger Talon OTP--buys a full {{item:3074}}  when he&#039;s ahead enough to not need more penetration. \n\n2. Everything assassins do have to have counterplays via huge delays/skillshots, but Enchanter supports can all double the effective health of an ADC with a few point and click spells that are also instantaneous. Hur dur dur Talon needs to play the vision game for a year and wait out the Ezreal&#039;s E to even think about going in, but all the efforts don&#039;t mean jack shit because that Ezreal also has a Lulu. Again referring to Yamikaze, there&#039;s a reason why he bans Lulu in every single game he plays, and dodges Zilean games on his main account. These enchanter supports, they need to suck at everything else wayyyy more for how well they can protect a single target. They have to lose something major in return for counterpicking an assassin, or assassins won&#039;t be worth picking, ever.\n\n3. {{champion:18}} {{champion:67}} {{champion:81}} {{champion:498}} The fact that it is a team game, and assassins will need team setup to reach past the enemy front lines, but ADCs who can peel themselves still exist. Oh, did I mention how much damage any given ADC _won&#039;t_ lose from dedicating an entire item slot to something like {{item:3143}} ? \n\n4. {{champion:420}} Every{{champion:59}} Single{{champion:54}} Champion{{champion:516}} Who{{champion:113}} Goes{{champion:19}} Tank{{champion:254}} But{{champion:77}} Still{{champion:5}} Outdamage{{champion:106}} Us. Similar to my last point about ADCs, building tank items are nowhere near detrimental enough to one&#039;s damage. Get two of these fuckers, one in top and one in jungle, and you will not only have a very good cc heavy comp, but any normal backline will still explode in the blink of an eye! Isn&#039;t that lovely?\n\n5. {{item:3157}} {{item:3156}} {{item:3026}} The amount of macro and micro skill required to kill someone who is equally skilled, versus the amount of skill it DOESN&#039;T take to build an item and be three times safer...yeah, I don&#039;t think I need to say more.","replies":[{"poster":"jocomotion","date":"2018-04-23T05:11:37.584+0000","up_votes":27,"down_votes":4,"body":"So basically your saying assassins have too many weaknesses to let their strength shine\n1: itemization\n2: defensive supports\n3: defensive builds/abilities\n4: more optimal picks\n5: anti-burst items\nMakes since.

In my opinion there are two points to an assassin. 1: snowballing and becoming a huge damage threat to enemy squishies.

But building defensive in mid game is a bit too strong.\n\n4: the main difference between assassins and those Divers/Vanguards (Plus Illaoi) is that assassins have WAY more mobility and burst in exchange for tankiness. The reason someone like {{champion:54}} deals more damage than say {{champion:238}} is because over the course of a game Malphite just has more opportunities to fight on a regular basis.

That’d be nice\n\nYou're right mostly right, but one thing you didn't understand is that I'm not saying assassins need ”utility“. I'm saying that if an assassin is 20/0, he should be able to oneshot the backline on his own and then turn on the front line to melt them with basic abilities. That's the only way to it make it worthwhile to pool the extra resource into an assassin. We used to be able to do this back in season 3, when getting a sustain/dps item didn't gimp our damage by an insane amount. We need that back.\n\nAs for supports that counter assassins, it's cool that they exist, because I firmly believe that every game starts in champ select and counterpicking is very important. However, these assassin-counter supports also being completely viable in every other scenario, where they don't even have any assassins to counter...that's where the problem lies, and that's how strong most enchanter supports currently are. \n\nFinally, regarding {{champion:54}} and his brethren tanks...if you think that Malphite doesn't burst, you've clearly never played against one recently, lol. All the champions I listed can pretty much delete half of an ADC's healthbar with a single rotation, and then they almost ALL have some sort of steroid/dps spell from that rotation to help them finish the ADC off.","replies":[{"poster":"MorganFreemanBot","date":"2018-04-23T18:00:06.043+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Hawthorn Tree,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=6JshVLbr,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2018-04-23T06:02:07.870+0000)\n>\n> You&#x27;re right mostly right, but one thing you didn&#x27;t understand is that I&#x27;m not saying assassins need ”utility“.

ADC's and assassins would build Last Whisper as a first / second item (They'd go brutalizer > ghost blade / Ruined King / BC  > Last Whisper), and be set all game. Tanks and bruisers would stop existing as soon as someone bought last whisper, so so they only existed for the first 15 or so minutes (less gold in the game back then).\n\nWhile I agree that assassins are weak currently, S3 was a season which saw more damage and insta-deletes than the current season.

Mages are honestly the least of our worries at this point, because it&amp;#039;s not like any lane assassins suck ass at pushing the lane. There are a trillion million reasons why we suck, but mages is not one of them. If Riot actually wants to see us in competitive, here are a few hints.\n> \n> 1. This is the biggest thing. Revert the entire bullshit with Lethality and give us the real Last Whisper back. If you break down the penetration we need into like 20 different items, we will never be fucking playable outside of Intermediate bots. Assassins all need snowballs to be worth anything, and snowballs always mean that we are hogging a large portion of our team&amp;#039;s resources. And, if we have no space for any items aside from raw damage--no dps, no sustain, nothing--then there&amp;#039;s no way for us to live up to the amount of gold being poured into us. When we have pop off games, the only situation where we&amp;#039;re useful, we basically take a full item from our teammates, but then our builds can&amp;#039;t let us to really cash in that extra item. Against players of the same caliber, which is the only kind of players a pro will face, a pure damage build can only down one person before we ourselves are out of commission. Honestly, there&amp;#039;s a reason why LL Stylish is always looking for builds that aren&amp;#039;t lethality, and even Yamikaze--a Challenger Talon OTP--buys a full {{item:3074}}  when he&amp;#039;s ahead enough to not need more penetration. \n> \n> 2. Everything assassins do have to have counterplays via huge delays/skillshots, but Enchanter supports can all double the effective health of an ADC with a few point and click spells that are also instantaneous. Hur dur dur Talon needs to play the vision game for a year and wait out the Ezreal&amp;#039;s E to even think about going in, but all the efforts don&amp;#039;t mean jack shit because {{champion:498}} {{champion:81}} {{champion:18}} that Ezreal also has a Lulu. Again referring to Yamikaze, there&amp;#039;s a reason why he bans Lulu in every single game he plays, and dodges Zilean games on his main account. These enchanter supports, they need to suck at everything else wayyyy more for how well they can protect a single target. They have to lose something major in return for counterpicking an assassin, or assassins won&amp;#039;t be worth picking, ever.\n> \n> 3. {{champion:18}} {{champion:67}} {{champion:81}} {{champion:498}} The fact that it is a team game, and assassins will need team setup to reach past the enemy front lines, but ADCs who can peel themselves still exist. Oh, did I mention how much damage any given ADC _won&amp;#039;t_ lose from dedicating an entire item slot to something like {{item:3143}} ? \n> \n> 4. {{champion:420}} Every{{champion:59}} Single{{champion:54}} Champion{{champion:516}} Who{{champion:113}} Goes{{champion:19}} Tank{{champion:254}} But{{champion:77}} Still{{champion:5}} Outdamage{{champion:106}} Us.

Assassins shouldn't be the go to pick fora given meta (arguably no champion should be the ideal champion in every situation) however I completely disagree considering assassins are becoming more and more relevant with the recent patches look at {{champion:238}} and {{champion:157}} who are considered difficult to play but both have 10-20% pick rates and winrates over 50% in fact outside of Leblanc 46% and ahri 49.67% and akali 49.51%  (according to the op.gg) EVERY AD assassin is sitting over 50% winrate. although this doesn't usually explain how impactful a champion is because difficulty of champion has mattered historically looking at champs like lee sin who could have a 45-46% winrate but still be considered a S+ tier jungler in the past. The itemization isn't the issue as it is players just started learning how to play the game that makes it less of a brute force approach the game requires you to be better instead of your champ just being better. what i mean by this is knowing how to lane/trade and position properly.\n\n2. What huge skillshots are you talking about especially as a talon main? Your Rake ability? That has a  huge frontal cone or your ult that a giant AoE that grants true invisibility. I'm sorry i'm not seeing it. Fizz's only skill shot is his ult which isn't that hard to hit and usually requires a flash to avoid at certain distances. Ahri is probably the only one I'd agree with. Zed's difficulty is backed by the amount of outplay ability he has built into his kit with so many dashes and burst built into his passive so and even then his skill shots aren't that difficult to land its more about shadow placements and positioning than skill shots. Yasuo's only skillshot is super spammable. From what I'm seeing all you want in the game is to be able to go balls deep every game without being punished for it. OTP are bad at the game they only understand how to play their champion (ask any pro player listen to any educational content creator or coach they will all tell you being a OTP in high elo doesn't make you good at the game and just because someone is a OTP doesn't mean they know exactly how to balance said champion)\n\n3. ADCs are strong because of supports riot said they were supposed to address this in the mid season patch so we will see. The main issue with these champs are supports can protect them until they are relevant while the support is still able to itemize towards being strong. They no longer buy wards they don't pay for sightstone their itemization is cheap if your gonna complain about itemization i could see this being the proper place to complain about. If you nerf the traditional actual support champs you end up in a game where kill lanes become meta again which is good or bad depending on preference because sight stone is built into the starting support item a number of mages can just substitute for the traditional supports. \n\n4. Assassins aren't really meant to do large amounts of damage you're supposed to pretty much be in and out for 1 MAYBE 2 kills and then dish out mediocre damage. They are burst champions not DPS champs not sustain damage. Tank damage hasn't been that much of an issue from what i've seen there always seems to be a mixed response here one minute i hear tanks die too quickly they're like paper the next minute they're doing too much damage. Tanks do more slow and drawn out damage for the most part. In a 1v1 situation tanks are usually doing 3-5 rotations where most ADC/Mages/Assassins can do most other squishies in 1-2 rotations its actually a rather large difference.\n\n5. Items like these {{item:3157}} {{item:3156}} {{item:3026}}  are needed in the game without them you remove too much counterplay to a lot of champions that exist in the game. The biggest issue in league and it was something i heard from a few points of view is there is too much physical damage in the game. Turrets do physical damage and majority of the jungle does physical damage outside of gromp. Because ADCs are historically 80-100% physical damage and top/jungle are typically Physical damage as well (outside of a few small niches like {{champion:50}} {{champion:8}} {{champion:516}}  for top and {{champion:154}} {{champion:113}} {{champion:28}} {{champion:60}} for jungle)\n\n\nTL;DR\nAssassins are in a decent spot from what I've seen from high elo players and in low elo play. I think hitting support itemization is probably the first place i would look at followed by anti shield items or just nerfing how shield work in some way; I've seen diminishing returns on shields and decaying shields as options idk if these are the best ways to go about it.\n\nI'm not convinced on the tank argument there are a lot of conflicting evidence and opinions of players to really make me agree with this.\n\nAssassins aren't DPS champs they are burst the total damage done to champions is skewed in a lot of games there is a lot of meaningless damage done its a pretty bad stat to use to explain how much impact you have or your champions use.\n\nThere isn't enough magic damage in comparison to physical damage the game I'd recommend turrets doing like a 60/40 in terms of magic damage to champions would nerf tanks into itemizing more of a split build and would nerf dives (however this might make wave clear comps OP) would be cool to see APC in the bot lane that work similar to ADC. \n\nDepending on how riot nerfs supports will determine how much of a buff assassins get. However a number of the recent patch changes have been super beneficial to assassin champions without actually making changes to those champions AKA minion gold changes the mana changes next patch. The only actual issue that I can understand is the strength of supports however it seems like its not all supports its just the shield supports.","replies":[]},{"poster":"InTheory","date":"2018-04-23T18:27:19.335+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have a question to you since everyone's bashing supports 24/7 lately.

A \"carry' build is too far from optimal, while a optimal Lethality build lacks too much to truly carry, and that's what I find problematic.\n\nAnd my point isn't that these good players avoid Lethality, it's just that you can't take advantage of a lead with Lethality alone. When you have the kills that can usually keep multiple champions in the game, you have to do the work of multiple champions, and you really can't do that if you have only penetration.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"OHminus","date":"2018-04-23T14:23:29.277+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> Every Single Champion Who Goes Tank But Still Outdamage Us\n\nVi doesn't go tank.
