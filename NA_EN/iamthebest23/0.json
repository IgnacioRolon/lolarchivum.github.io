I was planning to just have Thresh so I could open the Hextech chest and get a skin for Thresh from it. The problem is, I just got Kayle and Riot Kayle from the congratulating 10 years. Is it possible for me to just get a skin for Thresh and not Kayle? I've been working so hard to get a skin for Thresh. It's been weeks. I don't want it to be ruined by just getting Kayle.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-21T15:22:24.917+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The Anniversary gifts are not something that can be exchanged for other content.
