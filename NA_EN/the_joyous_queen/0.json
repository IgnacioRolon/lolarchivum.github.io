Losing LP and sitting on ice for prolonged time because the league client crashed during champion select (which in my premade of 4 happened some 4 times in the 3 games we tried to get in tonight) is the worst feeling as a player. This needs a solution.\r\nSo Riot ought introduce one of the following\r\n1) We need to recognize dodging queue is sometimes necessary, or forced: and give a free dodge per day without punishment, This is appealing not just due to client stability issues, but also empowers the community to not need play with the all to common troll that is so often seen below diamond tier, which players have clambered for.\r\n2) Introduce into the new alpha client (and depending on release ideally the current client) a mechanism than can differentiate between a willful dodge and a client crash. I am not a programmer and understand this may not be technically possible, but if it is it seems the BEST solution to satisfy the problem while keeping current philosophies around punishment for dodging consistent. \r\nor we need find another solution.\r\n\r\nWhat isn't debatable is A) The Client is currently far too crash prone, B) Ranked experience is being negatively effected by such stability issues, and therefore C) Action ought be taken by Riot.\r\nI sincerely hope a Rioter can respond to these concerns, \r\n\r\nSincerely \r\n\r\nA summoner who is sitting out a 30 min ranked ban due to two client crashes in 24 hours XD","replies":[{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2016-10-12T09:31:09.897+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> 1) We need to recognize dodging queue is sometimes necessary, or forced: and give a free dodge per day without punishment, This is appealing not just due to client stability issues, but also empowers the community to not need play with the all to common troll that is so often seen below diamond tier, which players have clambered for.\n\nOh hell no.  That would be so abused.  You realize that the current system is already abused with people constantly dodging games that seem disadvantageous, right?  Giving a free dodge every day would make it take so much longer than it already does to get into a ranked game.\nMaybe one free dodge a week with a higher penalty on later ones or just one free dodge a month would be ok though.\n\n> 2) Introduce into the new alpha client (and depending on release ideally the current client) a mechanism than can differentiate between a willful dodge and a client crash.

People could potentially just turn off their internet/turn off their computer to get free dodges.  Again though, this may be possible at least in limited capacity, and I am simply unaware of that.\n\n> What isn&amp;#039;t debatable is A) The Client is currently far too crash prone, B) Ranked experience is being negatively effected by such stability issues, and therefore C) Action ought be taken by Riot.\n\nI'd argue that technically Riot need only take action when it approaches great enough of an issue to cause a decent number of players to leave or play significantly less.  For me, the crashes are nowhere near consistent enough or disruptive enough to keep me from playing.","replies":[]}]}
