Champion unlocks through shards at the 450 IP tier give a very poor rate of saved IP per shard and essence spent and you are better off saving your essence to unlock an expensive 6300 champion and your shards to reroll into a randomly priced champion.\n\nFor skins it's fine to unlock them with the chest's contents as you would otherwise need to spend RP on them and random skin rerolls are way less likely to get a skin you want on a champion you want to play","replies":[]}]}
