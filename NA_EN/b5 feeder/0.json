As a matter of fact there is no sound at all. I was wondering, am I missing something? Perhaps I'm not turning an option for it on or something but I have looked all over and haven't seen anyone with this problem.\r\n I have, however, seen many with screeching noises. I wish I could get even that, but hey maybe somebody here can tell me why I'm not getting any sound at all.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-09T04:38:39.433+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Losing the sound in your playbacks is something we're currently looking into.

I think the replay system is awesome and the ability to capture highlights from replays is super awesome!\n\nSo, for others who are experiencing the exact same issue as the original poster, I believe I have a workaround.  Let's just first make sure we're talking about the same issue, shall we? \n\nIf your issue is complete silence from start to finish (no crackling or other noise) only when watching your recorded highlights and you have confirmed you get normal audio playback during the game, and whenever you use whatever application you use to play back the highlight clip you get normal audio playback from other media (not your highlight movie clip), but do get silence when playing highlight clips you recorded, then this post is for you.\n\nI had this issue and discovered I could only capture audio to the highlight clip if I selected a different sound device from what I normally use. I have a RealTek audio device through which I get all sounds in Windows 10. However, since I'm using an HDMI cable from my nVidia video card to a display, I also have an audio device aptly named \"nVidia High Definition Audio Device\". It made no sense, but by selecting this device (nVidia) before capturing the highlight, I was able to produce a highlight movie that contained actual audio and could successfully hear that audio when playing the highlight through the Chrome web browser.\n\nIt's hard to say if my workaround only works in Windows 10, but I'm using Windows 10, and it worked for me.\n\nSo if you have this issue, the following steps might help you:\n\n1. Set up your LoL Replay and queue to a section with lots of sound. You can use fast-foward, rewind, whatever. Just make sure you hear sound in this part of the replay.\n2. Change the sound device...\nIf, in Windows 10, you click on the speaker icon in the system tray and you get a pop-up window that shows the volume, click on the ^ arrow in the upper right.\nIf you then get a pop-up dialog that says \"Select Playback Device\" and there's only one sound device available, then I have failed you. There's simply no other sound device to select. You should down-vote me.  :^(\nHowever, if you see more than one option, then there's a pretty good chance these steps will work for you, especially if you normally listen through headphones, but have your video card connected to a monitor with speakers using an HDMI cable.  :^)\nFirst, write down on a piece of paper which sound device is currently selected. You will want to get back to your normal sound device when we're done.\nOnce you have noted the \"currently good and working\" sound device, try selecting one of the other audio devices by clicking on one that is not currently selected.\nIf my step 2 above doesn't make any sense to you, just know that all you really need to do is change the playback device to a different playback device. I'm sure an Internet Search can help you find the instructions for your computer. You might need to include your OS version in your search. For example, \"Windows 8 how to change playback device\". Don't forget to note the original sound device you were using.\n\nPlease note: once you have selected a different audio device, you might stop hearing all sounds from your computer. Don't panic. For example, in my case, since I listen with headphones plugged into the front panel jacks, as soon as I changed to the nVidia sound device, I could no longer hear any sounds at all from any Windows program or from the OS itself. This is because all audio was now redirected to the HDMI display and I typically have the volume on my HDMI display turned off.\n\nWarning: This also means that if you have your other sound device is connected to some other audio equipment (e.g an A/V receiver) and that equipment is powered on and set to a high volume, you may be surprised by the audio you hear when you switch devices. (So ensure volume levels are moderate and to your liking before switching the active sound playback device.)\n\n3. Now hit the Record button in the Replay controls. You might not hear any audio from the game client while the replay is playing and the highlight is being recorded (see above).\n4. Record as long as you want, but for test purposes, you just need a short clip with some sounds (even if you can't hear them while recording).\n5. Hit the Stop button in the Replay controls (same button as Record).\n6. Pause the Replay (to avoid any extraneous sounds from playing while you try to listen to your highlight movie).\n7. Switch back to your normal audio device.\n8. Find the recorded highlight and play the movie in a web browser or your choice of media players.\n9. Confirm you now have audio when playing your highlight movie.\n\nSo this is a hassle, but it worked for me. If it didn't work for you and you have other audio device selections you can make, then please try repeating these steps but selecting a different audio device.\n\nDon't forget to re-select the original audio device when you're done capturing!\n\nI hope the delay in Riot addressing this issue has to due with the inability to actually reproduce the issue. I know it's impossible for anybody to figure out what is causing an issue if one can never see it actually happen. Hopefully the details of this workaround make it easier to reproduce the issue at Riot (e.g. use an HDMI cable connected to a display monitor that has built-in speakers, on a Windows 10 machine, where a different audio device -- like one that supports the front panel headphone jack -- is in use).\n\nP.S. It occurs to me that I should probably mention I also have the microphone jack set as \"Line-In\" rather than for microphone. I usually pipe my phone audio into my computer using the microphone jack so I can listen to music and still get OS alert sounds and such. I mention this in case it is a contributing factor to the issue.\n\n{{champion:15}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"EhtOst√§f","date":"2017-07-17T02:36:53.864+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same here.
