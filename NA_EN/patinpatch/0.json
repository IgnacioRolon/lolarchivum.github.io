We were able to get the game working for our friend so now we can hang out again.)\n\nA friend recently picked up the game and says he's getting a blank screen when he clicks continue on the victory/defeat screen. \n\nSo far the only way he's found to get out of this is to restart the computer.

A repair is a good place to start, as *Rineyy* has suggested, however, a more comprehensive list of potential solutions can be found in [this guide.](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting) Since it sounds like the application is hanging and potential causing the entire computer to freeze, this may be caused by bad drivers or other system settings.
