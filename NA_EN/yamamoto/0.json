Sometimes these boards accounts needs a gentle nudge in the right direction.\n\nIn my Boards Profile, I still see the old users' level and posts (but the icon is correctly showing mine) and the Match History link from there doesn't work (404 Error: Player not found). Also, going to the Match History link directly from the dropdown menu (not from Boards Profile) does work, but when I begin to filter, my old name shows up without an icon. I opened a Support ticket to address these issues. Thanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-12T22:59:27.694+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry about that!

I have one remaining issue related to this Summoner name change. When I first go to Match History, everything appears fine, I see Yamamoto as my Summoner name and the correct icon. When I use any of the filters (for example, go to see Kayn only data), my old username reappears and the icon is a black square with a grey question mark. This is a minor issue, but it would be great if that could be fixed. Thanks again for your help, I appreciate it.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-13T00:07:13.960+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh.... huh yea that's another weird issue altogether. Since the normal sync I used didn't seem to work properly this time, I'm going to reach out to someone a bit higher up who can mess with your account a little more than I can. Let me know in a day or so if it's still iffy!","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Yamamoto","date":"2017-08-12T08:10:03.313+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"One more observation. Websites (LoLKing, LoLSkill, OP.GG) that compile data on Summoners all show correct data for my account under Yamamoto. None of them show data from the previous name holder, and all appear to be showing data that I created under the previous name, as I'd expect. Is it possible that this is a caching issue with this website in particular, and once the cache is refreshed, the previous owners data won't show anymore? I believe that the source of data for this website and for the websites I listed above would actually be the same, but I could be wrong. Please let me know, thanks.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Yamamoto","date":"2017-08-12T06:45:24.058+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would like to add a little more observation. When I hover over my name in this post, it says Level 17, but the icon is certainly incorrect. I am currently using an Arcade icon.

Also, I don't see this most recent post there with the older posts.","replies":[]}]}
