However I did not see the email until today (it hid behind all the twitch email spam). Anyways, the link i click to setup my account links me to an error page. (see the link) Is this error due to the fact my acceptance email link is so old or because PBE is shut down? If it is too old I would like a more up to date link so I can create my account.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nThe Mutation{{sticker:zombie-nunu-tears}}","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-02T22:54:03.242+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not you, it's the site!
