If im afk in the middle of the game, it is my fault and i shouldnt let others suffer the same cause as i did. And i believe same goes to the others whether u r intentional afk or dc, team should be punished by losing LP (which cause great dissatisfaction in game) becoz we were put into disadvantage from afks","replies":[{"poster":"Weiner the Pooh","date":"2016-07-25T01:14:19.084+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeah its broken system that doesnt work but riot likes to pretend it does.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Blakiepug","date":"2016-07-25T05:31:28.637+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Targons Blade,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=jzEqIsGB,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-07-24T23:55:29.366+0000)\n>\n> The /Remake system only activates towards the beginning of the game if someone has been inactive for 90 or more seconds within the first 3 minutes of the match.

I'm sure this is a rare occurrence and I don't know what caused remake to fail but I thought it was something I should share so that it does not occur to others in the future.","replies":[]}]}]}
