Riven is my most played and I got to diamond 1 with her this season but I dont like playing her anymore because I actually want to climb. \r\n\r\nI thought riven was going to get buffed soon, this nerf really surprised me.","replies":[{"poster":"Shadow Gilgamesh","date":"2015-05-16T21:03:50.766+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, yes, assuming you're being honest with your diamond tier status, Riven is probably not that great, because people know her shenanigans \n\nRiven's biggest weakness is in the champ select screen, and that's why she's a bad character while still being broken and unhealthy.\nYou can pick Garen and shit all over her, but woops your top got to pick before theirs so Riven can't be counterpicked? Or you're bronze where people ONLY play the 4 champs they like and won't counterpick her? time to hold on to your butts and hope the Riven player is garbo, because Riven sure isn't.","replies":[]},{"poster":"FedAsFuk","date":"2015-05-16T20:49:46.161+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I couldn't see her getting a buff but the nerf did really catch me off guard. She was in the Katarina point where while she can do a ton of damage and destroy your backline in a single combo, there is legitly so much CC and raw tank and HP that the feat is borderline impossible. To be fair the ult should have been slowed to allow a bit more counterplay (lets be honest how many times it should have been dodged but couldn't be) but the new 1600~ is sad, it is a light breeze now wind slash, IDR what it was before the nerf but I feel like somewhere halfway between the 2 would be agreeable, or more so by all sides. I may only be gold on other accounts so i can't speak for higher elo but for me I rarely to never saw Riven played, if she was picked it was almost certainly by a Riven main, so any champ played almost exclusively by mains of that champ will have higher win rate and overall stats compared to other champs in that role. \n\nActually this change has pushed me into the mid lane, the mega tanks of top just are not really a style I can play well with and enjoy.","replies":[{"poster":"FedAsFuk","date":"2015-05-16T20:53:05.489+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Part 2 the black cleaver change really killed Rivens ability to handle tanks, more so than the minor MS nerf and overkill on the windslash speed, it is not a build path that is good for Riven, Phage into kindlegem? Phage passive is okay on Riven, MS helps with her nerf, but the fucking Kindlegem, you either now get both Ghostblade and TBC and merc/ninja boots, or you go normal build with CDR boots and go way the fuck over the CDR cap, effectively wasting 850 gold and half of the combine gold.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"crush1x","date":"2015-05-16T18:53:14.521+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"k","replies":[{"poster":"ImFlutterShy","date":"2015-05-16T18:56:51.287+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Vistha Kai","date":"2015-05-16T21:35:06.161+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's your only response.\n\nDamn, I clicked this thread without checking the \"authoress\".\nDon't worry, I fixed my mistake by not feeding the trolless.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
