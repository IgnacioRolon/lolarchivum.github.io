Your MMR will continue to tank unless you improve your play!\r\n\r\nI believe riot is to blame for this... does anyone else have this problem?","replies":[{"poster":"Son of Ornn","date":"2017-07-09T03:50:57.168+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"For starters, I wanna assure you that we don't tamper with players' stats, under any circumstances, in order to keep the integrity of Ranked play safe. It's really important that we keep that trust with you guys, and even if you trolled one of us I don't know of any way a Rioter could do that even if one wanted to. TL;DR, we're not sabotaging you, so you can rest easy about that. :)\n\nNext, let's talk about 3rd party sites. It's really cool you're being attentive and tracking your progression in Ranked, but when it comes to player MMR, we don't make that public to anybody. So if op.gg is giving you an MMR score, it's either wrong or just calculated different from the one we have for you... and therefore also not your real MMR. So take those numbers with a grain of salt, and focus more on your gameplay and doing your best to climb. After reading your post, I'm really seeing some passion for getting better, so no matter what I'm real positive you're gonna climb higher dood.","replies":[]}]}
