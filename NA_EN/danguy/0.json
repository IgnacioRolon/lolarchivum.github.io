This is accompanied by huge packet losses where the game will freeze for several seconds, then resumeand all animations will occur at once. Running a speedtest in the background shows i have 50 mbps download speeds, and i average 200 framerate. I have the game installing on a SSD and have absolutely no idea what is causing these issues. Anyone have suggestions?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-07T21:28:08.767+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You mentioned that you're encountering a lot of packet loss, which would be the cause of all those stutters and disconnects.
