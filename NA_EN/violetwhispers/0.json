We actually do allow a ***single, one-time exception*** for players who purchased an RP card in their old region before transferring their account to their new region.  If you wish, you can read more about this announcement here:\n\nhttp://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=4316004\n\nIf you do have an RP card on NA, feel free to [submit a ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and we should be able to help take care of it!  ^.^","replies":[]}]}
