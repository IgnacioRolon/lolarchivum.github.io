Sona is strong, I guess it's just (in)convenient luck that you don't see her often.\n\nBut win rate can be inefficient with pick rate often times. Think of a champion like malzahar. His pick rate (although I think it would increase because of his new skin) hovers are like what, 5%? Yet he has around a 53% winrate, but that's easilly concluded by the few people that are playing Malzahar are just very experienced. Win rate should only add up when there's a decent pick rate as well. I would say at least 20% pick rate. 10% is too small to go off of. And of all things, In challenger it really shouldnt be effected that much. Challenger win rates are like 30-70+% all the time. It's only 200 people out of thousands and thousands of people being tallied in other leagues","replies":[{"poster":"Ro0ki","date":"2014-12-17T06:33:42.781+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"And today her master+ winrates are 47%. challenger win rates are too inconsistent. sona is getting nerfed because riot thinks she has too much hidden power. i think shes fine though.","replies":[{"poster":"Diostukos","date":"2014-12-17T06:35:21.144+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Ro0ki,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=kjENgRQ5,comment-id=000100000001,timestamp=2014-12-17T06:33:42.781+0000)\n>\n> And today her master+ winrates are 47%. challenger win rates are too inconsistent. sona is getting nerfed because riot thinks she has too much hidden power. i think shes fine though.\n\nFunny because the rework was supposed to bring out that 'hidden power' so it's more readable.

Sona Q + empowered auto hits much harder than anything raka can dish out, and this is where the problem lies. \n\nA bit of an identity crisis within Riot's mentality imo. Supports usually can do one thing real well; utility (blitz, thresh, leona), heal (soraka, sona), or damage (annie, karma, pantheon). Some supports have more than one of these aspects in their kit, like alistar, nami, and sona. Usually, these multi-faceted characters have a major weakness. Alistar's heals are incredibly weak, for example, and his mana costs are through the roof. Sona has low mana costs, a potent heal, a potent (and easy to land) harass, and a utility ult. There's alot going on for her, even if shes not 90% pick/ban tier.
