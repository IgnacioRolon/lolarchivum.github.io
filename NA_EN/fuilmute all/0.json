With overhauled steroids and incredible scaling, Riot&#039;s rework did a great job with toning her back. These days though Trist just barely under performs compared to other ADCs, and my proposed change to make her feel more smooth and also a bit stronger would be to have her autoattack timer reset on-cast from rapid fire. In my opinion this should be tested on the PBE, and hopefully it&#039;s a healthy change to put her right in the middle-ground with other ADCs.","replies":[{"poster":"FuIlmute All","date":"2015-05-12T17:01:13.521+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"Bump","replies":[{"poster":"Tis a nice day","date":"2015-05-13T05:22:55.718+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"These aren't the old forums.

Even when she was supposedly unstoppable, there were other ADCs on her level (Lucian comes to mind).  Nowadays, she's not 'barely underperforming', she's weak.  \n\nI like the direction of your change, but she's going to need more than an AA reset.  Riot should just give her back some of her identity as the lategame AA-focused ADC, and take away some of the power locked up in her stacking mechanism (that no one likes having to use).  Undo the base attack speed nerfs or her passive nerf.  That or finally figure out a way to turn off E's passive so lasthitting isn't a hassle and freezing the lane becomes possible again.\n\nStill upvoting for Tris to see buffs that aren't on her stupid stacking mechanism.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Old Man Teeto","date":"2015-05-16T01:33:18.072+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When they put a ton of power into her E's ability to damage turrets (and explode hitting champions), they took away from pretty much everything else.\n\nIf I recall Doublelift gave the pro opinion that when you play against a Tristana you slowly lose the game as time goes by and she levels and gets gold, since she is the safest ADC at everything while being able to mow down teams in the late game.\n\nThey lessened that raw late game god status to make her be a stronger pusher/seiger... which just isn't her fantasy and feels wrong.","replies":[]},{"poster":"FuIlmute All","date":"2015-05-16T00:48:01.418+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think Tristana's numbers in her kit is fine.

Upon detonation, Explosive Charge stuns the target for 0.25 secs x Number of stacks to a maximum of 1 second.\n\nThis would offset her attack speed and damage nerfs, while maintaining and expanding the \"mark & follow-up\" mechanic they seem to be pursuing.  No matter what, I think it would be helpful if Tristana could detonate the charge early considering that it's easier to get out of her range now.","replies":[]},{"poster":"atomicwit","date":"2015-05-13T02:47:25.944+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"She currently has the lowest winrate and damage dealt of all ADCs in high ELO games.
