When it's not the teammates, the internet or the op champs, it's because of scripts.\n\nSo I just lost a ranked game, here what's happened:\n\nGot first pick, picked Thresh because why not. Our mid laner asked to be ADC and the guy who got ADC let him have it. The enemy team had no adc, it was a Yasuo and Rakan bot lane (aka, whack-a-mole on hard mode).\n\nWe go in the loading screen, and I realized that our Karthus has fervor of battle... great and since he's an adc main, he probably forgot to change his runes too... double great.\n\nLuckily, we got first blood because Yasuo has no escape but then 10 minutes later, everything went to shit: Lee tried to gank mid (despite being told NOT to) WITHOUT Karthus, and died to Xerath. Then Xerath killed Karthus some time later.\n\nThis Xerath snowballed out of control, we were doing even at bot lane but we lost lane because you know... 4 man ganks and Xerath got more kills. But unfortunately, a Xerath with a fully stack Mejai and Luden is very scary.\n\nThen at some point, both Lee AND Karthus started to call Xerath a ''scripter'' because of this:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/Ep8xPDlhC1A\n\nCome on, people. That was not even close to be a script, he just threw his e after Lee uses his w on a ward. Everyone and their mother know that if Lee sin is flanking you, it's because he wants to kick you towards his team. I even tried to calm my team (Jayce was on my side and Ez said nothing), but  Lee sin even treated Xerath to post this game on reddit.\n\nI never knew which script my mid and jungler thought he had. I think they thought it was the one who predict your movements (despite the fact that Xerath misses like so many q). And a guy with stacked Mejai and Luden is going to be fast so no dodge script.\n\nStop it please, I know Xerath is used by some scripters (like the one not too long ago) but this is fucking ridiculous. Yes, this guy has a 81 % winrate on Xerath, maybe he's a smurf or got in a massif winning streak (he's probably a smurf, he didn't have any games before S7). But you cannot  accuse someone of fucking scripting when you are in lane that you don't even play most of the time and when you come with wrong masteries, runes and plays one of the most immobile mage in league of legends.

Usually scripters tend to pick EXTREMELY safe skill-shot based champions with ridiculous potential if all abilities connect (like Cass, Ryze, Syndra, etc.) or ADC's where perfect (i.e. impossible) mechanics can 1v5 a game with relative ease.\n\nXerath's AP Ratios are:  75% on Q, 60-90% on W, 45% on E, 129-215% on R.  Basically if Xerath hits every shot of his R he can easily 100-0 any squishy that didn't build a fair amount of MR.  If he buys a Rylai's it's essentially guaranteed.\n\nOn-topic:  The R shots from Xerath are definitely off-center and make it a little less likely for scripting, however the way he was chasing Ezreal down and reacted to Lee was pretty great.  If he's playing on Locked Camera or immediately swapped back to his character (F1, Space Bar, etc.) it's fairly easy to see the ward pop up out of nowhere and if Lee's likely been trying to make flashy plays (very common) the entire game then he's probably going to keep doing it.  After the first few ward hops from a Lee I usually will place my CC right on top of it myself - if I'm playing Viktor I'll throw my W down as soon as I see the ward if he's been doing it all game, it makes it much more feasible to retreat or fight at that point, being able to get into a position where he's not going to kick me into his team waiting.\n\nThere's always reasonable suspicion in these type of cases though, I rarely if ever report someone for scripting, however if a Kalista is 15/0/0 at 10 minutes with perfect Rends every single time while dodging EVERY skill shot thrown at her, it's something I'm going to be watching and checking out the replay of.  Usually scripters are macro-poor as their scripts make them micro-perfect.  They'll often face-check bushes like a 6 item Maokai thinking they're the next mid fekar - mainly due to them being very low MMR themselves and not realizing if Nautilus pushes R on you, there's no way to dodge the rest of his team while you're CC'd.  The scariest scripters are those of high MMR that have excellent macro-play, as with perfect mechanics it's going to be ridiculous watching them end the game at 15 minutes alone.\n\nMan and machine working in tandem is terrifying, however on the flip side scripters are incredibly easy to bait.  If you know they're going to dodge every skill-shot, you can predict the direction they're going to go and force them to literally run into your team.  A competent player would never dodge a Brand W by walking IN to 5 enemies, a script doesn't care and is only going for the most efficient action.  You can lead them along the path you want them to go by throwing skill-shots in a direction they're forced to take.  Similar to playing against Bots, in reality, and it leads to some hilarious situations as dodging auto-attacks is impossible (save for a few abilities like Jax E, Shen W, etc.).  Watching Kalista jump into Maokai, Rammus, Syndra, Jhin, and Brand is ridiculously funny - even better if they want to /all chat and flame your team since they really didn't think Rammus would Taunt them or Maokai would push W.  Also, for what it's worth, the team with the scripter (provided they aren't duo-queued) will likely report the individual as well even if nobody else does.  It ruins the competitive integrity of the game and leads to a lot of distress from the player base.","replies":[{"poster":"Faustavian","date":"2017-04-30T00:44:28.727+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The amount of effort, research, and advice in this for a simple question is outstanding, I honestly can't upvote it enough,  You wouldn't mind if I referred people to it, right?","replies":[{"poster":"PlsCheckThisBush","date":"2017-04-30T00:52:34.098+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"For sure!
