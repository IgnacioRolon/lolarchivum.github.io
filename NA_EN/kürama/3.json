(@Riot)","subforum":"Maps & Modes","up_votes":13,"down_votes":0,"body":"#Changelog\n\n**May 29th & 30th**\n\n* Addded the \"Map Optimisation\" & \"Additional Security Features\" sections\n* Cleaned up typographical errors\n\n\n**May 31st**\n\n* Added the \"Relic & Quest Timers\", \"Player Tooltips\" & \"Bug Fixes\" sections\n\n\n---\n\n#Table of Contents\n\n* Visual & Sound Updates\n* Gameplay & Clarity Updates\n  * Quests\n  * Fortify\n  * Soul Anchor Trinket Upgrade\n  * Kalamanda's Relic\n* Relic & Quest Timers\n* Champion Mastery on The Scar\n* Map Optimisation \n* Additional Security Features\n* Player Tooltips \n* Bug Fixes\n\nhttp://cdn.leagueoflegends.com/game-info/1.1.9/images/content/gi-modes-cs-conquering.jpg\n\n#Visual & Sound Updates\n1. **Champion Spawn Animations** Can we get the Champ Spawn Animations which are on SR right now? Not just to CS, but to all other maps.\n1. Update the Turret SFX on Crystal Scar, Twisted Treeline & Howling Abyss to match Summoner&#039;s Rift.\n2. Include the minion spawn on The Scar SFX & VFX to match The Rift&#039;s.\n3. Update the fountain platforms on The Scar, it&#039;s quite old and looks lacklustre. \n4. Update the to Nexi to be a little richer and more bluish (for the blue side). The Red side looks red enough, but could be a little richer in quality.\n5. Would it be possible to update the Victory / Defeat Animation, so that the broken Nexus particles come from both sides, instead of just one like on SR and HA now?\n6. Update the VFX on the quest buff, please.\n7. Update the VFX on the relic buff as well please.\n8. Can we implement the moving grass like on SR?\n10. Can we get back the Announcer&#039;s \"New Quest Received\" VO when a quest has been received please? \n8. Can you darken the blue and red glow effects from the capture points by about 10%? (See below).\n\nhttp://2.bp.blogspot.com/-IX64qjoHCVQ/VWfTNGR-LqI/AAAAAAAAqnw/ikl2EBdfaNQ/s320/3434.jpg\nhttp://4.bp.blogspot.com/-DbMy5yLqoyU/VWfTNBlNAqI/AAAAAAAAqn4/DBG7qtkozZw/s320/423424234.jpg \n\n---\n\n\nhttp://4.bp.blogspot.com/-DbMy5yLqoyU/VWfTNBlNAqI/AAAAAAAAqn4/DBG7qtkozZw/s1600/423424234.jpg\n\n#Gameplay & Clarity Updates \n\n2. Give turrets +5 damage on each hit.\n4. Update pinging team-owned capture points to \"(Summoner) requests aid at the Quarry\".\n5. Update pinging neutral or enemy-owned capture points to \"(Summoners) has targeted the Boneyard.\"\n6. Update the \"Fall Back\" ping to state which point to fall back from. \"(Summoner) has signalled to fall back from the Windmill\"\n7. Would it be possible to change ping SFX of targeting enemies with the normal ping to that of the previous \"Enemies are missing\" ping? When the Smart Ping System was released; \n  * The \"Missing\" ping had a different SFX, much like that of a bell (\"ding\").\n  * The \"Danger\" ping had the SFX of the current \"Missing\" ping.\n  * Targeting enemies / enemy objectives had the SFX of the current \"Danger\" ping.\n\n---\nhttp://4.bp.blogspot.com/-nJ70upzuZAY/VWfTNOZl75I/AAAAAAAAqn0/_2B-VPkGltU/s1600/2342424235.jpg\n\n>#Quests\n\n6. Reduce the Quest start time to 4 minutes, and 4 minutes after a quest has been completed. This will allow for a more action packed battle as well as make things more interesting.\n8. For the team which owns less than 2 points at the time of the quests&#039;s arrival, allow them to capture 2 points to complete the quest.\n  * The first will grant the usual team buff and sap the enemy Nexus by 20 points.\n  * The second will grant the same team buff, which stacks on the first buff and saps the enemy nexus by another 20 points.\n  * In order to complete this quest and cancel the quest for the enemy team, the two points must be captured and the owned point must remain owned or at least neutral.\n   * The team which owns more than 3 capture points would have to defend 2 capture points, while fighting for the remaining point.\n   * If the team which owns more than 3 Capture Points completes this quest, it will grant them usual team buff, sap the enemy Nexus by 20 points and the quest will be cancelled for the other team.\n    * In the case of one team owning all 5 points, the quest will appear for the team which owns no points.\n    * No quest will appear for the team which owns 5 points.   \n\n\n*PURPOSES:* \n1. To give losing teams a chance to comeback as well as to give winning teams a chance to close the game.\n2. To make things more interesting and more fun!\n\n---\nhttp://2.bp.blogspot.com/-b0CaNFDavfg/VWZI48ydobI/AAAAAAAADgg/OgzcFKsWMB4/s1600/bDk7Aua.jpg\n\n>#Fortify\n\n5. Brining back Fortify, this time for one capture point.\n  * Makes a Capture Point immune to being captured by enemy champions and minions for 7 seconds.\n  * Increases the attack speed of the Capture Point by 100% for 7 seconds.\n  * Increases the attack damage of the Capture Point by 25% 7 seconds.\n  * Similar to Garrison, Fortify is now like Garrison&#039;s Sister.\n    * Fortify only works on **one** Capture Point.\n    * The point must be captured by your team.\n    * You must be near the point to activate Fortify.\n    * Cool-down is the same as Garrison&#039;s.\n\n*PURPOSE:* To give a Defender/s more defensive tools and a better chance at successfully defending the point especially when several enemy champions and minions crowd that particular point.  \n---\n\nhttp://4.bp.blogspot.com/-nJ70upzuZAY/VWfTNOZl75I/AAAAAAAAqn0/_2B-VPkGltU/s1600/2342424235.jpg\n\n>#Soul Anchor Trinket Upgrade\n\nFace-checking the brush is always important, but like on The Treeline, vision items are rarely built on The Scar. In addition to Soul Anchor&#039;s current function, it now holds a Scrying Orb Charge. \n\n* The Scrying Orb charge will be available 3 minutes into the match.\n* Once used, it will reveal a medium-radius area.\n  * Stealth units are revealed.\n* A high cool-down of 4 minutes is applied upon use. This is to ensure that it&#039;s not abused or wasted, but used wisely for the benefit of the team.\n* The Soul Anchor or Revive Charge is disabled when alive, but available when dead.\n* The Scrying Orb Charge is available when alive, but disabled when dead.\n  * So you don&#039;t try to use 2 of them at the same time...or accidentally activate one or the other.\n* All team members of both teams will have the Soul Anchor & Scrying Orb charges.\n\n*PURPOSES:* \n\n1. To give both teams a chance to peak at the enemy&#039;s movements and predict what point or objective they&#039;re going after. Counter-measures can then be taken.\n2. To make sure it&#039;s safe to proceed to the objective you are attempting to secure.  \n\n---\nhttp://3.bp.blogspot.com/-CLxC5Z9-tcM/VWfTNyi8C2I/AAAAAAAAqoE/IVVVW8G2jFg/s1600/67465456.jpg\n\n>#Kalamanda&#039;s Relic\n\n* A third relic, \"Kalamanda&#039;s Relic\" now spawns in the middle of the map along with the Storm relics. \n * This relic spawns at 6 minute mark and every 4 minutes after that.\n * You need at least 2 players to capture this relic (promoting teamwork).\n * To start capturing the relic the 2 players must be very close to the relic.\n * One player can start channelling the relic, but will not start capturing it until the second player starts channelling it as well.\n * It takes 7 seconds to capture the relic with 2 players, but each additional team-mate channelling it will reduce the capture time by 1 second.\n * If only 2 players are capturing the relic, but one stops, all progress will be lost.\n    * If 3 or more players are capturing the relic, but one or more stops, (leaving a minimum of 2 players) progress will not be lost, but capturing will take slightly longer.\n   * And of course, you can interrupt the enemy from capturing it, but the enemy can also interrupt you from capturing it.\n\n\n* Kalamanda&#039;s Relic grants \"Kalamanda&#039;s Hope\" buff, which;\n  * Increase Armour, Magic Resistance, Attack Damage & Ability Power to nearby minions.\n  * Also gives them a special visual effect when the minions have received this buff, similar to Baron&#039;s Buff on SR and the upcoming update to Vilemaw&#039;s Buff on TT.\n\n**There is only one \"Kalamada&#039;s Relic\".**\n\n*PURPOSE:* Another chance for losing teams to come back and for winning teams to close the game. This time, at their choice and timing, not the game&#039;s.\n\n---\nhttp://3.bp.blogspot.com/-UiTU9-3Eu4E/VWfJb-jJPWI/AAAAAAAAqnE/IojrBWw7u3w/s1600/2342423423423423.jpg\n\n\n>#Relic & Quest Timers\n\nSimilar to Summoner's Rift's jungle timers and Twisted Treelines Vilemaw timer, Relic & Quest timers should also be added.\n\n* There will be a timer for your team's Storm Relic\n* Another for Kalamanda's Relic\n* And the last for Quests\n\n\n---\n\nhttp://na.leagueoflegends.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_medium/public/upload/champmastery_client_1.png?itok=FMnXmtwI\n>#Champion Mastery on The Scar\n\nWith Champion Mastery working it&#039;s way well into The Rift, and giving some feedback on how well you played with that champ in that lane as well as giving us a chance to show off our mains, let&#039;s take it the next step in the system's expansion.\n\nRight now, the Dominion Score System accomplishes nothing other than telling you, you did well in capturing objectives and defending them. Let&#039;s incorporate these scores into Champion Mastery.\n\nNot only will this grant you Champion Points upon doing well, but incentivise players to actually play better on The Scar by;\n\n1. Securing and defending objectives. \n2. Slaying enemy champions to gain an advantage over objectives.\n3. Shutting down enemy killing sprees. \n5. Gaining killing sprees _and most importantly,_ \n**5. To work with their team to secure Victory.**\n\nThere will be a difference of up to 500 Champion Points between 1st and 5th place, depending on how close or how far the scores are.\n\n---\nhttp://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ZEbmTuLWd3s/VWfTOClobII/AAAAAAAAqoM/NhQblPxDON4/s320/dom4.jpg\n>#Map Optimisation\n\nAs The Rift has been optimised (better performance, less lag etc.) A little optimisation of all other maps would go a long way in ensuring players better enjoy League as a whole instead of just SR.\n\n---\nhttp://2.bp.blogspot.com/-b0CaNFDavfg/VWZI48ydobI/AAAAAAAADgg/OgzcFKsWMB4/s400/bDk7Aua.jpg\n>#Additional Security Features\n\nThis is needed to rid Runeterra of trash such as bots in **all maps** including SR. Co-op VS AI games on SR have also been plagued with bots.\n\n---\nhttp://3.bp.blogspot.com/-mLEZvmKZQ7o/VWZo6XqsxLI/AAAAAAAAqfo/KZAwrVdvdbs/s200/CSBackground.png\n>#Player Tooltips\n\nCurrently, if you've played a lot of Dominion recently, the tool-tip shows a \"Prohibited\" icon. Can we change that to a Crystal Scar icon? Just a tiny icon of the shape of the map. \n\nhttp://cdn.leagueoflegends.com/game-info/1.1.9/images/content/gi-modes-cs-conquering.jpg\n\n\nLikewise with Twisted Treeline, it's confusing. If a players plays top plane in TT frequently, it'll show the mid lane SR icon and if they bot lane in TT frequently, it'll show the jungle icon. Can we make it so it shows actual TT lanes please?\n\n---\n\nhttp://cdn.leagueoflegends.com/game-info/1.1.9/images/content/gi-modes-cs-quest.jpg\n>#Bug Fixes\n\nThe current Quest system is indeed bugged, in that, it does not always spawn at the 5 minute mark like it is supposed to. Further to this, it may not spawn 5 minutes after a quest has been completed.\n\n--- \n\n**Feedback is always welcomed as well as additional ideas!**\n\n*Images courtesy [Surrender@20.](http://www.surrenderat20.net/2015/05/527-pbe-update.html#map)*","replies":[{"poster":"disregardable","date":"2015-05-30T06:01:17.731+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"You know what it needs more than any of that?

In either case, we've been told by Riot that the quest system is not that easy to change, they can't even disable it without reworking the map.\n\nWhy would it be better to lessen the impact of quests?\n\nFrom reading the threads linked to me in another one of my threads, players wanted quests to be more meaningful.\n\nAside from that, there were a lot of complaints, even from Riot that Dominion isn't as popular as other maps due it being just capturing and holding more points than the enemy. This is spicing up the match and making it more exciting.\n\n> \n> \"For the team which owns less than 2 points at the time of the quests's arrival, allow them to capture 2 points to complete the quest.\"\n> \n> Overly complicated and not really needed, and it'd probably be hard for Riot to implement.\n\n\nNot saying it would be easy to implement, but why do you think it's not needed?\n\n> \n> \"Brining back Fortify, this time for one capture point.\"\n> \n> Sounds like a better Garrison that cannot be used to dive enemy points.

The point of Fortify was is to give defenders a better chance to defend their point when being ganked or crowded and also to spice up the Summoner spell diversity in Dominion, where Flash and Ignite are still dominant. \n\n> \n> \"In addition to Soul Anchor's current function, it now holds a Scrying Orb Charge. \"\n> \n> This actually sounds pretty cool, assuming it reveals stealth.

Not saying it's a bad thing, but it's an example that points are a bit weak.\"\n\nAnother alternative could be reducing the rate each minion push at. That would probably help more than increasing the damage. Not that 5 damage is a big deal though.\n\n\"Why would it be better to lessen the impact of quests?\"\n\nMainly because the quest system right now is somewhat broken. You can't really track it (I've tried in customs, it doesn't seem to be reliable, sometimes it spawns 5 minutes after you last got the quest, sometimes it doesn't, and you never know where it'll spawn), and it can sometimes spawn at very unfortunate locations. For instance, let's say you just managed to cap the windmill, but you're low and have to recall since they're surging top to retake it. Bam, quest spawns at windmill! It's a bit like the old 3v3 jungle, which had randomly spawning monster camps. Bad RNG can screw you over.\n\nIt also seems somewhat buggy at the moment, and it's very unclear how exactly it works. I've seen many games lost because of an unfortunate quest spawn. That's not good game design.\n\nQuests more meaningful? They are already really important, people just underestimate them. I think dying and using a revive trinket just to prevent them from getting a quest is a good deal, maybe even two revives. Quests are really significant. They provide a damage boost for your team and chunks 20 Nexus health.\n\n\"Not saying it would be easy to implement, but why do you think it's not needed?\"\n\nMost of the time, it'll be 3-2 in points, right? So the team with two points would have to get, say, windmill + enemy mid in order to get quest. If they are powerful enough to turn two points into 4\n\nLet's say it's 4-1 and quest spawns at bot. You'll get your mid back easily enough most of the time, and then you might get top. It's generally easier to get the windmill than the enemy bot, and the team that lost their mid and got it back will have three choices (top, backcap mid, or bot) while the enemy team just has one choice (bot). Besides, just because you're at a capture point disadvantage at some point in time doesn't mean you always will be.\n\n\"It is supposed to be like Garrison's sister. The point of Fortify was is to give defenders a better chance to defend their point when being ganked or crowded and also to spice up the Summoner spell diversity in Dominion, where Flash and Ignite are still dominant.\"\n\nEh, maybe. Though you could use Exhaust to defend the point. Ignite is way overrated on Dominion, Exhaust/Flash or Exhaust/CV are better options most of the time (Exhaust/Ignite is legit on some champions though). Garrison is pretty bad, as is Ghost. Do we really need more Summoner spell diversity in Dominion, anyway?\n\n\"I don't understand why you think the Dominion Score should be removed, after all you get points from capturing and defending objectives, shutting down killing sprees, gaining killing sprees yourself etcetera, so it's not completely useless right now, there is just no meaningful reward.\"\n\nI kind of get the feeling you're still fairly new to Dominion, are you? If so, welcome to the mode! The score system was found to be very misleading by the high Elo/MMR Dominion player base back in 2011, and there have been lots of threads over the years complaining about it. Ask nearly every high MMR Dominion player and you'll get the same answer: The score system is misleading and nearly useless. You get points for doing stuff you shouldn't be doing (such as capping instead of zoning/recalling, such as sitting on a point instead of controlling the jungle or pushing the waves, such as dying on a point for no reason, etc).\n\nAdding a reward to a broken system would just make it worse. I'm not sure if I like Champion mastery to begin with (actually, I kind of dislike it), and tying it to a broken score system would make it even worse. Dominion would be a better mode if the personal score system were disabled. It's misleading to new players, experienced players mostly ignore it.\n\n\"How would it promote poor gameplay?\"\n\nIt sounds like it would promote pushing. If you're playing Dominion well, you won't spend much of your time pushing, unless you're bot. Having a buff that baits people into 4-man pushing would be a bad, bad thing.","replies":[{"poster":"KÃ¼rama","date":"2015-05-30T20:41:43.057+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Sylian,realm=EUW,application-id=LFfTlAky,discussion-id=9NUYJ9En,comment-id=000400000000,timestamp=2015-05-30T19:10:37.324+0000)\n>\n> \"They seem to be a bit weak, especially when minion crowd a point, most points can't defend themselves and the point ends up being neutralized from minions.

Give or take a second or two. \n\nAs for the bad quest spawn, that is a potential issue. Not sure how to counter it yet. I can think up something, but it'll probably be even more difficult than the update I recommended. \n\nIt's pretty clear how it works to me. Anybody with a brain can understand what the text on top right corer, the icons on the minimap, and the yellow rings around the 2 targeted points mean. What players may not know is that it gives a buff and saps the enemy Nexus by 20 points.\n\n> \n> \"Not saying it would be easy to implement, but why do you think it's not needed?\"\n> \n> Most of the time, it'll be 3-2 in points, right?

Besides, just because you're at a capture point disadvantage at some point in time doesn't mean you always will be.\n\nYou'll still receive the capture 1 point / defend 1 point if it's 3-2. \n\nWhen the match becomes 4-1 it can be difficult for the losing team to regain more than 1 point. This is where the new quest system kicks in. When you recapture your mid or bot, you'll get a buff to help you recapture the next point, but if the winning team defends really well, the losing team wouldn't be able to recapture the points.\n\nAs for which points you'll have to capture in the capture 2 points / defend 1 point for the losing team, it'll be either recapturing the Quarry and the Drill or the Drill and the Windmill. The points they need to capture will be adjacent to the point they need to defend.\n\nIt also makes room for weird quests to appear. Say you were back-capping and the Refinery, but the enemy managed to cap all the other points, the losing team will have to capture the Windmill and the Quarry to complete the quest while the enemy will have to defend said points. So basically, this give the losing team back 2 points and they can then move on to contest the targeted points. \n\n\n\n> \n> \"It is supposed to be like Garrison's sister.

Ignite is way overrated on Dominion, Exhaust/Flash or Exhaust/CV are better options most of the time (Exhaust/Ignite is legit on some champions though). Garrison is pretty bad, as is Ghost. Do we really need more Summoner spell diversity in Dominion, anyway?\n\nI don't see Exhaust being frequently used in Dominion and yes I think we need more Summoner Spell diversity in Dominion.\n\n\n> \n> \"I don't understand why you think the Dominion Score should be removed, after all you get points from capturing and defending objectives, shutting down killing sprees, gaining killing sprees yourself etcetera, so it's not completely useless right now, there is just no meaningful reward.\"\n> \n> I kind of get the feeling you're still fairly new to Dominion, are you? If so, welcome to the mode! The score system was found to be very misleading by the high Elo/MMR Dominion player base back in 2011, and there have been lots of threads over the years complaining about it. Ask nearly every high MMR Dominion player and you'll get the same answer: The score system is misleading and nearly useless. You get points for doing stuff you shouldn't be doing (such as capping instead of zoning/recalling, such as sitting on a point instead of controlling the jungle or pushing the waves, such as dying on a point for no reason, etc).\n> \n> Adding a reward to a broken system would just make it worse. I'm not sure if I like Champion mastery to begin with (actually, I kind of dislike it), and tying it to a broken score system would make it even worse. Dominion would be a better mode if the personal score system were disabled. It's misleading to new players, experienced players mostly ignore it.\n\n\nNo, I'm not new to Dominion, thank you for the welcome though. :)\n\nI don't see why you should get points for zoning / recalling. If you zone the enemy out, it means you're able to capture more points and increase your score. As for receiving points on recalling, no.\n\nThe point of Dominion is to capture **and** hold. I've seen a lot of players make the mistake of recalling on full health and significant mana (at least 50%+) right after capturing a point. I've actually gotten pissed at players for doing this on my team as well.\n\nThis isn't TT / SR where you need to recall to buy items so you can gain an advantage over enemy champions and be able to kill them easier. Recalling on full health or even half health instead of defending a point is just giving the enemy a free point and asking to lose.\n\nThere's a reason your score is increased from dying by a point, it's because you attempted to defend said point and that's what the mode is about. Capturing and Defending / Holding. \n\nI think the score system is misinterpreted rather than useless. \n\n> \n> \"How would it promote poor gameplay?\"\n> \n> It sounds like it would promote pushing. If you're playing Dominion well, you won't spend much of your time pushing, unless you're bot. Having a buff that baits people into 4-man pushing would be a bad, bad thing.\n\nThe point of it is to promote pushing. It's supposed to add a side-aspect of the mode. Dominion is about Capture & Hold, but making it so blandly simple is what Riot thinks is starving Dominion of it's well-deserved popularity. \n\nA 4-man push to recover a point to attempt a comeback or to gain more points to close the game is the core purpose of the relic. It promotes some teamwork in Dominion, something I think is a bit lacking sometimes.","replies":[{"poster":"SKOBODO","date":"2015-05-30T21:32:46.253+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"I don't know about customs, but in Normals, it always spawns at the 5 minute mark and 5 minutes after a quest has been completed.

The score system rewards you for sitting idly on a point.  Proper play would have you *near* points, but in the jungle fog and out of sight, and closer to the middle to allow you to reach other areas faster.  As sylian said, it doesn't properly reward zoning/defense as opposed to actual capping. and the worst thing you can do with a team that just killed the enemy at a point is to all try to cap at once (which is the only way to get credit in the score system) instead of leaving 1 to cap and moving out to pressure other areas.  The current system is 100% trash and does not reflect on actual performance whatsoever.\n\nThat's not to say that it's flat-out *impossible* to create a good system, just that Riot has zero clue what they are doing.  It would require a lot more effort tho, and a lot of it would be based on *tagging* allies who were near you before you make a play, and crediting them properly with being a part of the overall play.","replies":[{"poster":"KÃ¼rama","date":"2015-05-31T20:41:54.138+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Kholdstare13,realm=NA,application-id=LFfTlAky,discussion-id=9NUYJ9En,comment-id=0005000000000000,timestamp=2015-05-31T19:15:29.503+0000)\n>\n> Rule #1 of Dominion: Never stand in the open.

This promotes senseless gameplay. Nothing's wrong with the enemy seeing you, and they come towards you, you know the point will help you fend them off.\n\nStanding between the points would give you a better reaction time, but can also make you lose a point as you may not be able to respond in-time if you stand in the middle whereas if you were at the point, you'd be immediately able to defend it. \n\nAs for 4 capping points, most of the time it's better, the faster you cap a point, the faster you kill the enemy Nexus (and yes, the more people capping, the faster you capture it). If you can successfully cap a point quickly, rather than slow it down to go toward another point you're not sure you're going to be able to cap then...\n\nThe system isn't trash, needs some improvements, but isn't trash. \n\n> \n> That's not to say that it's flat-out *impossible* to create a good system, just that Riot has zero clue what they are doing.
