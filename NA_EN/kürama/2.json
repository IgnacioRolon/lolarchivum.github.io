Thanks for taking this big step, I wasn't a fan of the new Masteries and all at first until I realized i have so many paths I can go down which brings my mind to thinking and I've already created about 4 pages that i'm satisfied with, with the results in games.  So really thanks for this! It's giving me a much more fun experience in general.","replies":[{"poster":"Danyul Targaryen","date":"2015-11-12T03:16:58.807+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"except they obviouslt favor ad champs","replies":[]},{"poster":"Riot ThEntropist","date":"2015-11-12T01:47:14.572+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":5,"body":"Awesome! I've found that the new masteries bring a new kind of excitement to the game for me. Since I kinda choose my play style before the game starts, with the different keystones, it makes it really fun to see if pay off in game. \n\nGlad you're liking it as well!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kürama","date":"2015-11-14T06:16:54.828+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"K, maybe not everything. The Rift Herald is too strong and the \"SHUT DOWN\" announcements are too common now. They also take priority over multi-kill announcements which I think they shouldn't.\n\nAnd is there another word we can use for \"SHUT DOWN\"?
