The problem being my Main LoL account has my Email attached to it and I could no longer gain access to that Email.\r\n\r\nAfter I opened a ticket, and a riot employee responded to me. They told me to make a Ticket that contained various questions from What was your first champ purchase to when was your account created. That I did do. But then shortly after I found that I couldn't log into my main account. My account had been denying my information, info i'd been using for 2-3 years. \r\n\r\nMy help ticket has been open since Monday and i've yet to receive an email/ticket on this account ( my smurf ) regarding anything to do with my main account. This is very frustrating, I do understand Riot is very busy. But i'd like to know if i'm getting my account back? I've been playing almost 4 years and devoted much of my time and money into this game. Please help me, it'd be more than appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-23T16:14:20.540+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I looked into this for you, and I see that a specialist reached out in your ticket.
