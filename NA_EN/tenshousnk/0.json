She does her job, which happens to be killing, and really only follows a code of law that applies to the morality of Noxian society. Does it help out Noxus? Do it. Does it hurt Noxus? Don't do it... most of the time. So as far as morality is concerned, she's in a bit of a grey area depending on where you happen to be located. If we're using D&D language, she'd _probably_ be Lawful Evil.\n\nJust my two cents.","replies":[{"poster":"Celio Hogane HD","date":"2015-04-24T11:29:43.292+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"But that would be saying Noxus is evil, and that is not totally true, i will say Katarina is Lawful Neutral, since she follows noxian honor code.

In some more deep detailed [lore](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/The_Journal_of_Justice:_Volume_1,_Issue_06#City-State_Tensions_Flare_in_Kalamanda), it stated that Katarina and Garen worked together to break up a brawl in the village of Kalamanda.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ryugi Kazamaru","date":"2015-04-23T22:27:12.719+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with Carnival Knights.  Katarina is very much Lawful Evil.  So is Darius, really, and Talon too, probably.  If you do evil things, like murder etc, and have no moral qualms about the horrible things you visit upon people, but you do it following a very strict set of guidelines for yourself (like not killing orphans and children and non-combatants), then you're totally Lawful Evil.\n\nThe actions you take and the reasons behind why you take them determines your alignment, and as Katarina is a professional killer, an assassin, a blademaster, regardless of her noble family name and her service to Noxus, she does take actions people could easily consider \"evil.\"  Just because you to bad things to bad people doesn't mean you don't do those bad things.  The actions are still evil, even if you're doing them for a \"just\" cause.\n\nAlso, Katarina is at least partially sadistic and amused by her trade.  Listen to her ingame quotes and personality.  That's not someone who is righteous and good in the traditional D&D sense.  Not by a longshot.  She clearly takes a side, so she can't be called Neutral.  Being Lawful Neutral would mean she follows her code, no matter what, regardless of whether or not it is good or evil.  Basically, a robot.  Considering her ingame personality and sadistic sense of duty and combat, I'd put my two cents on Lawful Evil too.\n\nThat doesn't mean she isn't a badass woman who fights for her country or has her own ideals of what needs to be done (like how she opposes Swain's rise to power etc), but she's too far over the line of Evil to be Neutral, in my opinion.","replies":[]},{"poster":"junglerboy16","date":"2015-04-23T17:51:13.401+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"She certainly isn't evil.\n\nShe does her duty loyally and efficiently, just like Garen, the only difference is that you are predisposed to assume Demacia is \"good\" and Noxus is \"bad\". Both are corrupt in their different ways, both make errors, both commit war crimes (although, Noxus is markedly more archaic/vulger/inhumane to our western minds). Also, just because they live in a certain place does not mean anything about how they personally live. Human rights activists in China don't support their government, because it is evil and corrupt in their opinion.\n\nKatrina may be a high class assassin the works for her government, but that doesn't mean she herself is evil. With the lore sort of up in the air right now, I'd place her firmly in Lawful Neutral, because it is too ambiguous whether the acts she carries out please her or are simply her duty that she is honor bound to fulfill, or even if she dislikes being an assassin, but is simply forced into it by her own patriotism.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KING OF MASKS","date":"2015-04-22T06:56:49.119+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If we're going by DND alignment, Katarina is neutral evil. Her father and Talon are probably in the same boat.\n\nEdit: As Laughing Fish points out, Kat does follow Noxian law and tradition; so you could say that in context she's actually lawful evil or possibly even lawful neutral. But outside of that context I'd still say she and the rest of Noxus are neutral evil, with some variation (i.e. Sion is more chaotic, Swain is more lawful).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wulf Helhammer","date":"2015-04-21T14:12:50.461+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm actually a bit unsure of wether Garen could be considered true lawful good....

Remember, lawful doesn't mean holding to a physical law, but rather to one's one values. A Lawful character holds true to whatever he/she believes in, whereas a Chaotic one is more mutable.","replies":[]}]}]}
