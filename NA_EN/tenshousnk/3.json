As for Quinn tracking the criminals down so she can execute them, it seems out of character for her and a waste of her time. She has the talent to track and traverse the terrain, sure, but her passion was becoming a Demacian knight. Executing criminals/ hunting them for sport seems beneath her abilities. Like, I wouldn't charge a high ranking officer with peon work. I imagine she has more important stuff to do like track down assassins like Talon.","replies":[{"poster":"TenshouSNK","date":"2016-01-08T01:38:50.208+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=iSawcy,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=fmyIV3N4,comment-id=00000000000000010000,timestamp=2016-01-07T20:08:53.500+0000)\n>\n> Idk about dungeons or prisons in Demacia.

BUT on the contrary if she was assigned to hunt the fleeing convicts and execute them as a minor task, would she agree? I would not consider it a sport something what draven does with convicts, but rather a task bestowed by the city to Quinn. Demacia let's the convicts lose, a chance on freedom, only if they succeed to escape demacian borders before Quinn catches up to them.","replies":[{"poster":"iSawcy","date":"2016-01-08T23:02:07.833+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=TenshouSNK,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=fmyIV3N4,comment-id=000000000000000100000000,timestamp=2016-01-08T01:38:50.208+0000)\n>\n> You are right, I totally agree with you when you stated that it's beneath her abilities.

If they're murderers, I think Quinn wouldn't hesitate to put them down. I'm not sure what she would do with a harmless convict like a thief, or some guy who didn't pay his taxes.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"TenshouSNK","date":"2016-01-07T04:16:15.260+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=iSawcy,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=fmyIV3N4,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2016-01-07T04:09:29.419+0000)\n>\n> Banishing a convict is probably what gets them executed in the first place.\n> \n> But that's just my speculation; this is only a discussion about executions and Quinn's personality can be interpreted through her actions in lore and what she says in game.\n\nAre there dungeons prisons underneath demacia where criminals are kept to rot?

I don't think she would have anything against his execution since its the demacian law which is doing it. I think that she would just walk past the convict who is hanging from a noose, strangled, fighting for his life.

I long assumed that since goddess Quinn was not born within the city walls that she would have a different reaction or varying opinion on hung convicts. But her past life is something she does not look back at and is now a proud loyal demacian it seems. She seems very lawful, not by the books but still has a lot of loyalty to the monarch. Thus it is safe to assume that she dislikes criminals of all sorts especially those that threaten peace and therefore will have no issues at all with a few scumbags being noosed right in front of her.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Ebonmaw Dragon","date":"2016-01-07T04:55:58.300+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You already asked this question months ago...","replies":[]}]}
