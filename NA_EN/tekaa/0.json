However, I have seen several arguments and debates in these discussions, I my self am also a hard core league player having peaked d2 100lp and failing my d1 promos 5 times(triggerd reelol) and floating in diamond elo for the past 2 years. I have hated this game, even despised at certain moments, however I have high hopes for season 9 and wanted to clear the air on weather or not fortnite has actually beaten league on peak numbers. My personal opinion on this debate is, league is league, it has its bad moments but its for us hardcore gamers that want something out of a hard /fun game, no other game will change that. Anyone know if leagues records on player count and its peak player base have been surpassed by fortnite ?","replies":[]}
