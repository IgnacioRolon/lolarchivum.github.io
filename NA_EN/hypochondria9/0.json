He seemed to be talking more in favor of the HP/5 (forgot they were on a real anti-regen kick back then), but also touched on how it was \"unhealthy for itemization to be forced to buy stats that not everyone wanted just for the MS\". He also went on a stat by stat comparison of the various reasons that people picked up FoN, and why they were bad ideas to pick up FoN, usually cost effectiveness. \n\nThe fact that the pro's were still prioritizing it over other MR buy's was baffling to them, as it just wasn't cost effective for the MR increase. The fact that MS only existed on an MR item made it difficult to balance Magic damage around the fact that everyone who wanted the MS was also picking up a decent chunk of MR. He saw the Regen passive as the only legit reason to pick it up, but felt that another item should be the \"regen\" buy over FoN as it meshed poorly with MR and MS (which is hilarious because he wanted to put it on SV).\n---\nThat said, most tanks don't really feel mana gives them enough of anything for their buck, and is almost seen as wasted gold on most of them as it doesn't necessarily make you live longer. Not to mention that there are tanks that can't use the mana at all. So they never really solved the problem as I have never thought \"you know what I need? More mana\" on any tank other than singed or Galio, and even then, I would rather pick up chalice on Galio.\n\nAlso, for how much you spend on Righteous Glory I would save a little more and rather pick up a Randuin's omen for health/AoE Slow, or a Frozen heart if I really wanted mana, or a Warmongs if I really did want just the health and regen. There is no value I get from Righteous glory outside the active MS Buff, and even then I would rather pick up Talisman of Ascension as It's FAR cheaper and I can use it to help my team escape, not to mention has better regen and passive MS on top of the active.\n---\nTl;dr- the same logic they used to remove FoN can apply to {{item:3800}}. {{item:3069}} is the only passive MS item outside of boots that tanks would really want, and it is better in every sense outside of providing HP.

Outside of that, I don't see any reason why a tank *wouldn't* pick up an early Nomad's Medalian and finish it later, especially if having to be passive in lane due to circumstances or feeling a little mana hungry in the early game.\n\nThat said, this kinda ties into my previous point. Righteous Glory exists in a very similar spot to Force of Nature, especially considering the reasons that it was removed. Plus, Righteous glory only gives you MS in immediate engage situations.

As for the slow, Randuin's has a scaling duration and lasts longer.

Better buff Mundo then as apparantly his stats are meaningless from his ult. =P\n\nI could definitely argue that Regen is a combat stat. I could also mention that with the cheaper price, you could easily buy the HP that isn't in talisman, especially when considering the passive gold that alot of tanks like. Over all, If you are buying this for the combat stats, you go ahead and pick up randuin's. If you are buying it for the MS, pick up Talisman as well. This is the same reason that FoN got removed and the point you seem to be ignoring. Other items perform better for whatever reason you pick up Righteous glory. Just like back in the past, FoN was outclassed in every way outside of it's passive regen. Btw Warmogs has that passive now, so Righteous glory really has no ground left.\n\n>This also doesn't account for the fact that you can buy the passive MS boost that Talisman gives on a boot enchant, so the passive MS doesn't really make it that much better than the lack of it on Righteous Glory.\n\nI didn't count for the fact that I could enchant my boots because it is irrelevant.
