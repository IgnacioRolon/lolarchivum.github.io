The hacker changed my password on my email then by gaining access to my email was able to change the password to my account on league account. I have been keeping track of the account by talking to my friends i found out he deleted all of my friends off of my friends list and is playing normal draft games on my account. I have submitted a ticket about this issue and even added the additional information but have not been responded to yet. What is the average wait time for a ticket to be answered?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-26T23:53:56.554+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not possible for me to estimate the average wait time at the moment, but response times have been a bit longer due to a large influx of tickets lately.\n\nAn account specialist will reach out to you as soon as possible if you sit tight until then. Let me know if you have any other questions.","replies":[]}]}
