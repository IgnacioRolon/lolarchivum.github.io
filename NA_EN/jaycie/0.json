So it looks like it's lagging and I get the Attempting to Reconnect popup a couple times, but the ping and my own movement is fine. (It doesn't spike to ridiculously high numbers or anything, it fluctuates between 40-50 like any other game)\r\n\r\nMy internet connection is working fine for everything else, and this is a brand new computer, I haven't even had it for a week yet. I've tried repairing the client but that didn't seem to fix it. Again, I can solo/duo just fine, but once you add 3+ people it starts to bug out.\r\n\r\nI'm worried because I'm not sure if I'm actually moving or if the game is detecting me as AFK. Would suck to get punished for this, and if anyone has any suggestions please let me know!","replies":[{"poster":"RiotBok","date":"2016-05-09T23:14:12.884+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"From what you've said, it seems like you're experiencing packet loss.  Dynamic queue shouldn't have any effect on the packet loss though given it's an issue with you sending/receiving information to the server, not to other players.\n\nI'd recommend checking out our [Connection Troubleshooting guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues).  It has a section specifically on packet loss, but just to be sure I'd recommend going through all the steps so we can rule out the most common causes.  Lemme know if this helps!","replies":[]}]}
