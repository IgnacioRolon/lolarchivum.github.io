Just want some of your opinions ^^","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey,\r\nI can’t log in, but I don’t think I got hacked or anything. I tried to reset my password multiple times, and the password link always gets sent, but after resetting the password, it still says wrong username or password. When I log onto the client, it says my account got transferred to another server, but I still have the account on the friendlist of my smurfs. And on sites like lolking it still says my account is in euw. I already contacted their support five days ago but haven't got any answer yet which isn't severe^^ I don't know, it is just extremely weird. My account pretends it is there, but it isn't actually.\r\nHope you have some ideas, and maybe a rioter can say something to this case.\r\nThanks\r\nPs: Please don't mind my English, I am still learning","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-09T23:45:48.447+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm.. it kinda sounds like your account may have been compromised, especially because you cannot log in and you've seen a message about it being transferred. We'll definitely help you out with this, but it will require some investigation, so we'll need to get back to you in your support ticket.\n\nResponse times are a bit longer than normal, due to the end of the ranked season and all the new stuff going out, but we'll have a specialist with you as soon as we can. :)\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions or concerns.","replies":[{"poster":"Ylhun","date":"2016-11-10T22:11:29.216+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the answer :D\nDidn't actually expect a rioter to answer\nI can't imagine how my account could be compromised... In the match history you can see three games which are not played by me (but you can only see them on the client when I log onto my smurf while on sites like lolking,op.gg those three games are not listed) My question is why? I am sure you have lots of request because of the season end, but I am worried that I wrote my email incorrectly :/ I don't want to waste my and yours time... But I don't even think that I actually got compromised because I still have access to the account's email. My account is still on euw (regarding the information on lolking,op.gg and on the lol client) I think I can tell the account's summoner name, don't want to break any rules (summoner name:My Creative Name) \nThanks :)","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-10T23:54:47.017+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can't confirm whether or not this is the case, since we'll have to investigate into this to figure out what's going on.
