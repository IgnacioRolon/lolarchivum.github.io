Then when I tried to get on the support page i couldn't send in a request because it wouldn't let me sign in. Anyone have solutions? Tried to call Riot to, but their only support is on the web page.

So then I try to re login. When I click login it goes into the login page, but starts to sign me out, which is weird because it said I was signed out. Then says an error occurred please contact something. That is why I can't submit a ticket.
