, if someone refuses to take advices and to stop from giving enemy kills ,if he is asked to play defensive and don't proceed to do that , should definetly pulled out for intentionally griefing his team as he refuse directly to play for win and just push his score higher negative, deaths  ,increasing the chances of your team to loss the game .**\n\nI know it sound stupid ,but it must be done , i no want to see people who do what they want , over and over again ... , something have to put thinghs where these belong.\n\n\nP.S : I won the game , i just played to win , because i knowed he grief+ been toxic and even if he don't deserve to win the game he will eventually reach nothing from winning that game thanks to me.","replies":[{"poster":"zPOOPz","date":"2019-08-14T22:51:28.530+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"so you are bitching about someone's choice of champion?\n\n#entitled","replies":[{"poster":"TheLegendBoy","date":"2019-08-14T22:54:00.054+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":11,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=zPOOPz,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=zmcIfQZn,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2019-08-14T22:51:28.530+0000)\n>\n> so you are bitching about someone's choice of champion?\n> \n> #entitled\n\nis not his picks , is about the fact he just can't protect and clearly expose you to loss the game , he instant lock ziggs , and not even prepick it , having lower experience over it , and also pulling extremly bad plays ,constantly not just in my game ,where he actually stayed to die and offer enemy kills , and also flame me + took my farm + had low vision score like 16 vision score in min 39 , that means , he warded quitly often with support item , no have to talk about pink wards use.\n\n\nWe almost lost the game ,my experience managed to save the game and win it .. , enemy kai'sa had 17 9 score , so that dosn't mean he haven't troll/grief and that i am just complaining about his picks... , i just talked about the fact that i very often meet trollers/griefers who play ranked autofill and escape the punishment system very easy...","replies":[{"poster":"zPOOPz","date":"2019-08-14T22:58:48.520+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"well. you could try picking an adc that doesn't need so much protection?  not picking or playing how YOU want is NOT trolling","replies":[{"poster":"TheLegendBoy","date":"2019-08-14T23:00:23.131+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":11,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=zPOOPz,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=zmcIfQZn,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2019-08-14T22:58:48.520+0000)\n>\n> well. you could try picking an adc that doesn't need so much protection?  not picking or playing how YOU want is NOT trolling\n\ni was locking before he pick...\n\n\nI also in this thread mention how trolling should be defined and punished as , i think you should take an eye for","replies":[{"poster":"zPOOPz","date":"2019-08-14T23:01:57.346+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"did he had a say in who you pick?  why should you have a say in who he picked?
