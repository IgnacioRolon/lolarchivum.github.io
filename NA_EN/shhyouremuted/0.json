How much has any major sport changed over the last decades? How popular do you think soccer would be if we all of a sudden changed the rules so that you now have to use ice-hockey clubs to play it? Me personally, I think people would abandon soccer and start watching icehockey, basketball, rugby or any other sport instead. \nSomething that's close to perfected doesn't need much change, League has reached and left that stage long ago, sadly.","replies":[]},{"poster":"L9 Caps","date":"2016-05-30T17:14:33.037+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok so every Solo Player has this problem.Seriously the ones who wanna duo or trio etc are probably kids who are afraid of playing ranked alone.they dont know how to play the game.and solo players have to deal with their raging/flaming(rawr) all game.Riot has completely forgotten the purpose of ranked in the first place .   RANKED IS FOR YOU TO IMPROVE AND SHOW YOUR INDIVIDUAL SKILL not to go and play with friends.The only place where playing with friends should be allowed are normal games and other gamemodes which arent Ranked Games.Seriously i made it to gold 2 last season.Now im currently sitting in silver 3.I have been playing for about 3 - 4 years.Seriously.People never asked for dynamic queue(except dem scared raging kids) , we only asked for a fair matchmaking system(which is definitely not dynamic queue)  , a new champ select so we can get the roles we want in ranked , and some other stuff riot still doesnt give a damn about.(I tried my best not to say anything negative this post,it was hard,I am salty , and for obvious reasons).Seriously anything before season 5 was great.Seasons 5 and 6 in my opinion are the worst in league of legends history.{{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}}","replies":[]}]}
