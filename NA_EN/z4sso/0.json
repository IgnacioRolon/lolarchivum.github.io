[1] Yes, I know this was done because of the global efficiency pass, and that there is more gold flow in the game, but there is a loss of satisfaction towards making this purchase. I no longer FEEL GOOD about buying this item. [2] Although this item may hold alot of INVISIBLE POWER through its passives much like the previous Frozen Heart + Aegis of the Legion, it really is INVISIBLE.\r\n\r\nRiot&#039;s previous CLARITY (tm) and FEEL GOOD (tm) catchphrases no longer feel applicable. I sink 1975 (350+1625) more gold into this item and come out with a weak feeling jungle item. [3] What I mean is ~2700 gold into the game, I barely have any applicable combat stats. When I visit a lane, the laners can be at say 1600 gold (random number I threw out) and probably outduel me. \r\nJust a side joke: I come and gank a slightly losing lane? Oops. I gave them a double kill. (:\r\n\r\nAs a comparison, a simple warrior enchant gives:\r\n-60AD\r\n-10% cdr.\r\nThere is no hidden power behind that. What I see is what I get. At the same time, the warrior enchant also represents a huge amount of dueling power and SATISFACTION in the purchase. [4] I bring this item to a lane? I&#039;m probably going to cause some heavy damage.\r\n\r\nAs an alternative, I now feel like mimicking the S5 Fiddlesticks and skipping the tier 2&amp;3 jungle item entirely (It&#039;s not like it gives bonus gold.. and the components already give the full +30 experience on camp and basic sustain). I could rush a Stinger -&gt; Nashor&#039;s Tooth and still sustain just as well through my efficient clear speed (synergizes with that machete on-hit). This decision not only allows a stronger 6-item build (since it no longer keeps a weak 40ap final item), but allows me to arrive at my powerspike of other important items MUCH faster.\r\n\r\nLet me stress that I believe that Riot has probably (Let a man have his doubts. Perhaps overrating the spellblade passive? :P) fairly adjusted the item efficiency of all the enchantments. This is all about SATISFACTION. If indeed they are equally efficient, that means that a significant portion of Runeglaive&#039;s cost is dedicated to mana sustain. This honestly feels like it penalizes mages for their mere existence within the jungle. Mages need to CAST ABILITIES, as a basic identity and part of their KIT. Abilities cost MANA. Meanwhile our fellow lee sin brethrens can autoattack away and clear camps. His building AD makes it easier to kill camps AND champions. \r\n\r\nSexy Diana here spends 100 gold, 40 of which goes into sustain (let me be picky and name MANA sustain as a primary cost) and 60 of which goes into damage.\r\nManly Lee Sin spends 100 gold, 100 of which goes into damage and by proxy, 30 goes into sustain (of HP).\r\nSad Diana has to pay a tax of 40 gold just to even function properly. :( \r\nMakes me feel sad just thinking about it. Nearly as sad as seeing that Dragon Tamer Tristana death animation.. FeelsBadMan.\r\n\r\nAll this probably goes into the ancient debate/issue of mages within the jungle, and remains a balancing nightmare for Riot.\r\nPlease be kind Rito and give mages in general a crutch when we take a stroll in the jungle. Don&#039;t penalize our mana needs.. I mean I understand mana-gating, and AD champions also cast abilities... but :(\r\n\r\n[1] I realize there is a bunch of other new misc jungle stats that replaced the old jungle item passive. \r\n[2] I don&#039;t know &amp; haven&#039;t bothered to calculate the new efficiency of the item + new passives. \r\n[3] Yes, I know I&#039;m paying for that extra jungle sustain.\r\n[4] I&#039;ll trust Riot adjusted it as fairly as it adjusted all the other items, which is 120~130% efficiency.\r\n\r\nAs a side... I honestly can&#039;t imagine what the situation is like for other mages in the jungle.. If Diana is already considering other alternatives to items, and runeglaive is meant to synergize well with her.. RIP other mages.\r\n\r\nIf there&#039;s anything I failed to point out/have not realized, please KINDLY point them out.. Don&#039;t hurt me pls.\r\n\r\n**TL;DR. Despite item efficiency probably tuned correctly, Runeglaive feels like a very underwhelming first buy.\r\npls give us bak 10ap (:**\r\n\r\n-Just another **self-justified whiner**.","replies":[{"poster":"AthenasVendetta","date":"2015-11-11T18:26:49.056+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"It was also a very easy way to get a \"lichbane\" without needing that much gold....
