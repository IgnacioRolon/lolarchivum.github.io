(Hi ZionSpartan.)\r\n   - You honor the jungler who actively ganked and did not afk farm jungle or tax lanes to inflate his CS#&#039;s. His impact on the game is better rewarded and incentivizes a more team-centric approach in the future. (Not you Meteos.)\r\n   - You honor the mid laner who might suck at laning, but roamed like crazy and helped all your lanes win instead. (Looking at you Hai.)\r\n   - You honor the ADC who afk farm&#039;d side lanes and did nothing the whole game, aside from POPPING OFF that last fight. (I am Lucian and my pocket pick is Yiliang Peng.)\r\n   - You honor the support who might&#039;ve sucked in lane and got caught out multiple times, but got the 5-man combo that won you the game, or the support who peeled 3 assassins and made the enemy team sit the f*ck down. (APHROMOOOOO)\r\n\r\nStats may not accurately reflect your play, but the honor vote can now show your skill.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, this change will also benefit ARAM players, as the existing requirements are much more stringent to receiving an S. Doing so usually requires gaming the system or a sub-optimal playstyle of hogging farm and being a KDA player.\r\n\r\nTLDR; YOU GET 3+ HONOR? YOU GET CHEST. BEEP BOOP.","replies":[]}
