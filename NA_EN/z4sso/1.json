Unflinching may represent alot of hidden power (?), but I can&#039;t feel anything happen at all in lane. After using unflinching, you get 25% tenacity which is great, don&#039;t get me wrong.. but tenacity is more valued within teamfights, where chain cc is more of a concern. Within lane, the .2sec of less CC doesn&#039;t change anything at all. I would liken this choice to a scaling rune, as it&#039;s more impactful later in the game.\r\n\r\n2. Demolish is strong. It feels great when you can pop it. But how often can you pop it? Can you even reach the enemy turret safely? Stay under it safely? This is another snowballing option. The winning team has a better chance of proccing demolish. Once again, this rune helps only after a certain time. It doesn&#039;t help you while you lane.\r\n\r\n3. Font of life.. ayyy ally champions who AUTOATTACK get healing. Excluding yourself of course. Hip hip hurray. Let&#039;s not even get into the amount of healing (which really feels negligible), you can&#039;t even make use of it yourself. In fact, you might get 2 people proccing it if you are lucky from your team: jungle/adc. What&#039;s the issue? Well this isn&#039;t helping yourself at all. Doesn&#039;t do jack during lane. You don&#039;t even get to feel if it&#039;s impactful or not because you aren&#039;t being impacted! So once again, we have another rune that doesn&#039;t help YOU in lane, OR out of lane. \r\n\r\nSo with this set of choices, you do not have a single rune that helps you IN lane. \r\nGuess what? Your rune power budget is now 1 Keystone and 2 Lesser Runes vs. 1 Keystone+1 Greater Rune+2Lesser Rune. \r\nOther trees get great stuff like Triumph/Presence of Mind, Sudden Impact, Manaflow Band, Perfect Timing.. What does resolve get? Runes with extremely conditional usage that are NOT impactful within lane. That just sets yourself on the back foot. So I&#039;ll go to another tree as my primary. F*** Resolve.\r\n\r\nTLDR: Greater Rune Selection are very unappealing. All other trees have something great. Resolve is trapped by convoluted usage conditions.","replies":[]}
