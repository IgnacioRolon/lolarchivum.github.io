I successfully relogged onto my account for there to be no option to re-enter the game. This has never happened to me before. I can literally queue for another game while on my friends friend list it says that I am still in game. I am in a promo and I do not feel like I deserve a loss for this.","replies":[{"poster":"Hardjohnny1","date":"2017-06-24T20:17:23.731+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am technically now in 2 games at once. The disconnected game and a new game that i was able to queue for.

It's weird though if it showed your friend in the same game.  Is your PC clock up to date?  Your friends list might appear out of sync if your windows clock isn't sync'd. \n\n It may have just been a hiccup with your ISP, but just to be safe it wouldn't hurt to run through the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to make sure your network to the game server is in good health.  Sorry if this resulted in a loss, though I hope that can help prevent further possibilities of issues.","replies":[]}]}
