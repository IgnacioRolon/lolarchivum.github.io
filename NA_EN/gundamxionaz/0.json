From people choosing Revive and Teleport so they can go feed the enemy team quicker, to people who AFK/Leave randomly, or when you ban someone's favorite champion and they go BALLISTIC and end up... feeding the enemy team... this is horrible. Now, I know these topics have been posted a million and one times but, damn I thought you people were kidding or they are rare circumstances!\n\nThe worst part of all is when you KNOW you have a troll right during champion select. Either the game starts and you have to waste 20 minutes, or you can leave and get a penalty and have to wait. You think Riot would figure out some solution to end this crap. \n\n*UPDATE* However, I completely understand how difficult is to fix these issues. If you have a scenario when someone leaves because they are mad or DC, you should still lose LP. I know the community has mentioned you shoudln't lose any when this happens, however people WILL exploit this.  Whenever you are about to lose, someone on your team could technically just leave to help prevent his teammates from losing a ton of LP. Not a great idea.\n\nWhat about people intentially chosing stupid champions with idiotic builds for the sole purpose of trolling? Well, you will end up having a lot of matches not even starting because you'll have a few people who don't like your champion choice or they may think you are \"beneath\" them, ending up with a lot of people just booting someone for no reason. \n\nWhile I don't have solutions to these problems, I do believe Riot should make it a priority to think of some method to prevent this from happening. I know attitude is cleaned up considerably in Gold, late division Platinum and Diamond, but a majority of players start in Bronze/Silver. Why should they have to suffer through these social insane people just to climb to a better elo?","replies":[{"poster":"Kledy McKledFace","date":"2015-01-02T06:01:56.112+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":3,"body":"riot's community the worse in the world...","replies":[{"poster":"Ð É M Ø Ñ","date":"2015-01-02T06:14:14.316+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"I completely agree, I've never in my gaming history encountered a worse gaming community.

We are suppose to bring our best out here to compete for victory; however, many players are not treating it as such. We are seeing AFK, raging, trolling, ect because people are simply not putting there best forward. For some people, something as small as an inconvenience can cause the player to throw everything out the window.\n\nComing from Diamond 5, majority of matches are played with all players doing their best. These are the most intense, focused, and ultimately satisfying (win or lose) matches I ever play in LOL. Trolling and such occurs on occasion as expected. My point is that the purpose of ranked definitely there.\n\nThe many problems are in the lower tiers. Many people love the good experiences, but simply can't handle the bad the naturally comes with it. A common toxicity is also people's perspective of how good they really are (tier and division position) and can't accept where they really are causing them to lash out.\n\nWhat it comes down to is us as the community. Riot has influence over how seriously we take ranked by its structuring, but we ultimately determine how seriously we take ranked (and thus determine others as well as our own experiences with ranked). We complain to Riot about ranked but the root of the problem is with us.\n\nAnd here is the paradox. There will always be a vast majority of worse players then there are better. We can say that Tier Gold and above are the most desired positions (since this is the minimum tier to earn the most season rewards), and Gold use to represent the top 10% of players (now it's top 25% due to saturation on how tiers work).\n\nSo how do you get the other 90% (now 75%) to play their best in ranked... when their rank is telling them they are not the best? Riot seems to have tried using the most recent iteration of Ranked to 'soften' the visualization (division and tiers) that they are not the best, but this just lead to the inflation of high end tiers and ultimately devaluing them. At the same time, lower players brainwash themselves from their real position with how they visually see their ranked, which against has been softened with many safeguards.\n\nA lot of people argue going back to the old ELO system, but I would honestly say that most people can't emotionally handle seeing a hard number that solidifies that they are not the best. \n\nSo what is to be done? Personally, I don't know. Riot, being a business, definitely took the right step in softening Ranked by adding floaty divisions and tiers to give the players hope in thinking that they are better then they really are. They need to appeal to the widest audience after all. So the real question is how to further refine this, to make people take ranked seriously, and to add real value back into the tiers.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SelflessTeammate","date":"2015-01-02T15:31:36.077+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I started in Silver 1, finishing 7-3 and feeling pretty good. I was demoted twice.\n\nI record games, so I watched the replays, went over entire games thinking what I could do differently, and while, primarily jungling, I'm used to being blamed for every single thing that goes wrong whether I had any conceivable control over it or not, I realized it's just the toxicity, which then affects everyone else. Top lane dies twice, someone decides to say something snarky. Top lane gets upset. Others join in. Somehow I get brought into it, upon which I become very generous with the mute button.\n\nIt's not the gameplay that makes Ranked so horrifying. It's what comes before people who intentionally feed, or leave, or in whatever way throw the game with their method of choice. Someone says one criticism a little too harshly and everyone plays far worse as a result.\n\nI've never seen more instances of others assisting the enemy team intentionally than in just a few Ranked games. It's astonishing.\n\nIt's exceptionally rare that neither team suffers this, but oh man, those are memorable. Ever been in one of those games when everyone's actually trying as a *team*, remembering that it's a team game, not a contest to see who can get the most kills, being able to differentiate between this and a first-person shooter? Those are what make the game worth it. Even one among 20 normal games is gaming bliss. No toxicity at all, just an almost professional level of teamwork and encouragement.

In a ranked solo queue match, one side almost always stomps the other. Riot needs to accept that a team doesn't come together in draft mode in 60 seconds.\n\nIt would be great if they implement features to remove toxic players or deny a game without losing IP. Additionally, they need to fix the match making system to make the teams more balanced rather than finding the same average MMR. Perhaps it is just not enough people queuing for ranked, but for me, if I want a fair game I 'd chose normal.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Arch Mage Magnus","date":"2015-01-02T08:39:23.860+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Quite honestly, as much as Riot says they care about the player base, they really don't.

The issues common in Bronze-Gold are I imagine more people issues which don't actually have anything to do with game balance directly.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"i hate school101","date":"2016-08-06T23:35:56.068+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I SO AGREE, I just realized that this post is old but still today in s6 its terrible.

Im currently Silver 5 and i dont think my parents have ever seen me with a smile on my face while playing this game. The community is ABSOLUTELY terrible, and the game is just meh anyways. So game 3 of my promos to Silver 4 a couple days ago i had a Afk fiddle who dc'ed at 4 mins and a Gragas mid IN S6 like i said to this game ''Bruh 2 things, Its not s3 and your not Faker'' And of course u can guess how that game went.
