Neither was Aatrox yet he was totally transformed into something he was not.  How is this fair?  All Aatrox players are very reluctant on all future reworks because how they were straight thrown under the bus.  If this was a lesson learned by Riot in terms of they are never doing that again, then why not fix their mistake when it comes to Aatrox?  Morde fans did not want a champ like Riven and didn't get one, they have to understand how poorly Aatrox mains continue to be treated.","replies":[{"poster":"Vespy","date":"2019-06-24T02:09:49.308+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":8,"body":"Old aatrox was boring.

Why can't they just split the two of them into different champs and admit they messed up?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Power Cosmic","date":"2019-06-24T02:33:25.774+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What other champs do you love?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Phieldworker","date":"2019-06-23T21:35:31.495+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I get that Aatrox mains from the past are upset. He’s definitely a complete different champion with the only similarity being a drain tank monster now. \n\nBut I actually enjoy the new one a lot. I socialize in ap bruisers and juggernauts. And it’s so much fun playing Aatrox. Riven feels like your slicing through enemies with her sword but Aatrox, very different. You feel like you are smashing through bodies and I just can’t get enough of him. \n\nAgain I definitely understand how much it would stink to lose what you’re used to (For me it was Swain) but I enjoy the new Aatrox.","replies":[{"poster":"Power Cosmic","date":"2019-06-23T21:49:09.274+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is  a lot of enjoyment to be found within LoL.

Some champs that get played a lot have no community while other less mainstream champs have strong ones.  But the rework was about money not people.  Team Fight Tactics shows what people really want and that game is the opposite of what Newtrox, Pyke, and Akali represent.  Malphite, Amumu, and old-Aatrox in LoL represent to what TFT is about, which people greatly desire.

There's always going to be ''someone'' who says that, but in Aatrox's case almost every old main disagrees with this rework.
