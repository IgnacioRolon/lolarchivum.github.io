Every other case you just arent going to hit many stars before dying bc everyone else hits really hard, and your stars do not and are easy to dodge.  So late is mostly about your Q bc the R is nothing like a Brand, Lux or Vel'Koz ult either.  Sol is half a champ late.  If you get into a fight with an adc (or anyone else fed) you will often have to hit them with more than 4 stars, and this not going to happen so you are free for them.  Even good players cant hit a lot of stars when the game opens up and champs are moving around.  A Sol can not siege like other mages either.  He is not a lane bully, can't seige, or carry, but he is the most fun champ in game.","replies":[{"poster":"Stars Shaper","date":"2019-06-01T06:15:58.573+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"That’s a direct consequence of the nerfs to his HP and HP regen. \n\nIt’s really sad how a mage that is supposed to stand for long fights on a range that is inferior to all other mages and less of a lot of ADs too had to be nerfed in the only thing keeping him alive while doing his basic job.","replies":[{"poster":"Power Cosmic","date":"2019-06-01T06:37:23.796+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, I think most his value is in his W yet you can hardly use it with any consistency late.

He often can't get much from his stars late, and that is where most all his power comes from.  His win rate sinks below 40% late bc of that.  So the weakness isn't really scaling, it is that you are rarely going to hit someone w/ more than 2 consecutive stars late, while EVERYONE else one shots.  Assassins like Kass, Talon, and Zed roam very well, lane well, and scale hard (while also all countering Sol).

You can just press R in late game for 1k dmg which gives massive  slow for  everyone it touched, and it's not hard to hit it on multiple enemies, then u follow up with your Q and W, In 1 second u almost one shot squishy target there, everyone is slowed by rylai, u got zhnoya to survive crucial dmg. Sol have decent late game. I would say his weakest moment comes after roa, enemy already in this moment are enough strong to solo u and outclear the wave in a good time. U get the dmg after 2 next items. Of course there are several champions that can kill u at lvl 2, maybe even at lvl 1, but honestly sol have one of the best lvl 1 performence in the game. Use your R more times, earlier in the fight, it helps u a lot, in actual dueling, don't save it for later.\n\nLux and vel koz are squishy, while u have 1k hp more,  U can just DO a GENKI DAMA from the half of the map, followed by some engage from your team, it's often unavoidable, your team will get a kill.","replies":[{"poster":"Power Cosmic","date":"2019-06-01T15:09:30.201+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lux and Vel are very safe and effective and pay nothing for it while scaling great.

It takes away from his Budget and Enforces him to be a \"Push Lane, Look to roam\", so he falls off after lane phase and his lane phase is not good in that. \n\nSpecially when Anyone can roam with TP, and other champions also do what he does. (I wouldnt say Better or Worse)\n{{champion:4}} {{champion:163}} both have the Push lane Look to roam. However The difference between Him and the others, is that his E is where all his power Budget is going. This Champion Cannot be good With this ability. The Threat of this champion being able to Roam as early At level 2(maybe if you're Spicy Enough)  Is to strong, and Cannot have a Strong Mid(After Lane), and Late. \n\nI'm saying This ability is why hes weak and will continue to be weak. He isnt supposed to be strong, just helps others get strong. \n\nAnd what I suggest. was to Kill the Roam ability to make him more of a DPS Mage that helps Zones. But I think I might want to change him for what I think would be more Fun and interesting. People might like his roaming potential. \n\nSO, You cannot increase his Damage. as against supposed to be weak Mid to Late. So I think if you changed the ability so that it has controls like Sion During the ability, But even LESS control, just small adjustments.
