I have been in Silver 5 and Silver 4 promos close to, if not more, than 20 times, which means I am winning a lot of my games out of promos and basically losing all of them in series. Basically the free win should not cost a game so the act more often serves its intended purpose. I am not a Diamond player, but I have been in series enough to be approaching Diamond....\r\n\r\nGiven my play my competitive standing is a travesty to anything remotely close to fairness. Competitiveness in my games comes mostly from me being handicapped in matchmaking.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.lolskill.net/summoner/NA/Dezus/champions\r\n\r\n^^^Keep in mind I am doing that in Silver 5 and losing enough to never progress^^^","replies":[{"poster":"Mobile Phone","date":"2017-11-02T17:29:44.647+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"what.\n\nThe free win is not the reason you have been bronze-SIlver 4 for 4 seasons now","replies":[{"poster":"Power Cosmic","date":"2017-11-02T18:01:14.401+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Truth^.

Myself included, people have a tendency to overestimate where they belong skill-wise and there likely elements of gameplay that you're not even aware you're lacking in. Or perhaps you're more lacking in areas than you think you are. I haven't looked at your stats at all but if you've played at least 200 to 300 games and still can't climb, I guarantee it's you.\n\nThere's literally nothing you can do about your teams, just identify what **you** can do to get that win rate up.  Like another poster said, you have a couple games in your history that look like you never grouped or weren't there four important fights. Without watching you play of course I can't say for certain what the reason is, but a lot of people in low ELO think that just because they get fed playing Lane bullies against bronze players that they should be climbing. You could be level 18 and full build at 10 minutes in and still be the reason your team lost if you didn't utilize your lead properly or died while fed as hell trying to be a one-man Army, thus giving the enemy a free inhibitor or Baron.

Only one of which does it look like you were in a position to carry. 2 of those games you had a kda that looked horrendous. Then the rest of the ganes you went like 0-1. 2-3, like you basically weren't even there. \n\nI have a feeling its more than matchmakimg on this one \n","replies":[{"poster":"Power Cosmic","date":"2017-11-02T18:00:52.178+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Stats are a product of more than your individual play, as good players know.  A lot has to do with who and what is on your and the enemy team.  Click the link if you want to know what type of player I am.  Also I clearly stated I am not Diamond, I was referring to the quantity of promo games.  Smurfing is easy, progressing when Riot has chose you individually not to; is impossible.\n\ntl;dr You most often arent going to blow away a good gnar or a good me... and that will show in your stats","replies":[{"poster":"WintersHarrowing","date":"2017-11-02T18:38:23.937+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"The more you speak the more your delusion shows. \nI went from bronze 5 after being hardstuck and blaming my teams just like you are now all the way to silver 1 almost to gold 5 two different times. \n\nYa riot has personally targeted you so you cant climb, get the foil hats out boys. \n\nNot sayijg this to talk shit, but I had to realize that I eas just bad once I did that I improved. You are probably just bad, definitely not as good as you think you are.\n\nAnd yes stats from an individual game CAN be a product of many variables in that specific game. But as your stats show you are not the main carry for like 90% of your games. In 10 game you had ONE that you could have carried but you still lost. 3 games you did god awful 1-5 ECT. And the rest of the game again you only went like 1-2, 2-3. You basically offered nothing. \n\nYour over stats show that you don't or just cant hard carry like you inisintuate you can. \n\nKeep blaming your teams man, not gonna get you anywhere ","replies":[{"poster":"Power Cosmic","date":"2017-11-02T18:49:45.884+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"You are only 1 of the 5 people on your team.

At its most diabolical matchmakings goal is to try and find where you average close to 50% win rates and put you there (this can be a several division gap as your sling shot back and forth).  Looking over the MMR gaps (not rank or division, but the mmr)  The trend looks like your team loses every time there is a  (100+mmr) gap in the enemy teams favor. This means that your individual impact on disfavored games is to low to have a significant impact, expect to see losses and go on loss streaks randomly until your mmr drops to the point your able to have said impact then you will see win streaks.   Yes, I'm aware other factors apply like if your playing off champions or got filled or a troll shows up, but law of large numbers is your hommie for climbing ladder and right now its not in your favor and the one who needs to change this is you.\n\nedit, also a free win is always in your favor, and it is significantly easier to get back to retry a promo then it was to get there the first time or make it to the next one after winning.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
