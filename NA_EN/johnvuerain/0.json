I searched up every suggestion on how to fix it but none of those worked. This started happening when a icon saying \"this window is trying to enter the internet, will you allow it?\" Something like that, but I clicked no, thinking it was some kind of virus but I think it was the html to allow you to go into the game after champ select. I really need help on this because I'm lost. LOOKING FOR A WAY TO REACTIVATE IT!","replies":[{"poster":"Son of Ornn","date":"2017-05-12T22:45:46.431+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It seems to me your computer was trying to ask for permissions to do something. In essence, your system is wanting to make sure that you know what the program is and that you are ok with it doing... whatever it needs to do. This time, you just hit the wrong button; no big!\n\nI suggest hitting up this [**Permissions Guide here**](http://riot.com/1SB1JXQ); that should get you back on track and let LoL run without a hitch. Keep in touch with me should anything else go wrong though. :)","replies":[]}]}
