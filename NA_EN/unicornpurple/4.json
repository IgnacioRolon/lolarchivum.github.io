The silence isn't what made Talon OP.  For the first 6 months of Season 4 Talon wasn't even considered a viable pick.  I remember during LCS someone picked Talon and there were a dozen threads about why Talon was a garbage champion and what a terrible pick he was.  \r\n\r\nI don't understand how Riot's balance team can be so ignorant to their own game.","replies":[]}
