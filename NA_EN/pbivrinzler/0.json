I&#039;ve always found writing to be something that helps me calm down, so I try and write regularly, but with my recent return to college, I haven&#039;t had much time to do so. \n\nI&#039;ve always liked a lot of the designs in League, but with the lore changes and everything, i&#039;ve found it impossible to keep up with. I&#039;ve also felt really bummed out that there isn&#039;t more to draw me into the skins. So I began to come up with my own ideas. \n\nDisclaimer: Obviously I don&#039;t own anything regarding league of legends, but likewise, my stories do not actually represent works, mechanics, or intended storylines for any project current or in development by Riot.\n\nfinal note: Please be merciful. These are merely for entertainment and are written at my own leisure. I don&#039;t get paid to write anything, and I don&#039;t have an editor, so quality is low in comparison to what it could be.\n\n**Available Stories: **\n[Academy](http://www.mediafire.com/view/eif85m8e1h8fi68/Academy.docx)\n[PROJECT](http://www.mediafire.com/view/17aokb2odl256fy/PROJECT.docx)\n\nThanks for your time.","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2015-08-28T16:34:26.970+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Only had time to look over the PROJECT story this morning (before work) but I really like it!  The little initialization conceit at the start is well done (and not overdone - often a danger) and the PROJECT fighting PROJECT description is also on point.\n\nIf there were anything, I think I'd try to work on differenciating the dialogue lines to A) make them seem less in touch with their humanity, and B) give them a slightly more distinct voice.  I know that's really difficult with so few words to work with, so maybe it's not feasible to do in the limits you have, or maybe you can do it in the description surrounding it.  For example, I liked the section:\n\n> “This is the end, Yasuo.” Zed’s helmet droned...\n\nThat, to me, gave Zed a slightly more distinct voice by describing it not only as a drone, but almost as if it came from the helmet, instead of the man.","replies":[{"poster":"PBIVRinzler","date":"2015-08-28T17:54:31.753+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really appreciate the kind response!\n\nI've always felt the urge to be creative in some way, but without the patience or finesse for drawing, I turned to writing. \n\nHonestly, I've been so busy with different things that I've had a major back up of numerous projects I'd like to write, from these ones to personal projects and the like. \n\nHowever in all honesty, They could probably do with another pass or two or three. Had I not really needed to get some ideas out of my head and just been really inspired to write, I probably would have held off and revised them, changing wordings and phrasings to further differentiate and characterize how I see the PROJECTs.\n\nAnd honestly, I may still do it sometime soon. Whether I do or not, I'll atleast do a double-pass on any upcoming projects, to ensure they offer a much better insight into the content I'd like to be a part of. \n\nBut again; Thank you for the kind response. I find it incredibly inspiring and humbling, as I honestly expected to only get a few kind words from other members, that might have helped inspire and motivate me to put even more of my time into my writing. \n\nThanks for dropping by!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"PBIVRinzler","date":"2015-08-30T03:07:36.981+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Update!\n\n*PROJECT v1.1*\n-Minor bugfixes; Most outragous errors with text fixed with a second passover. \n-PROJECTs further individualized.\n-Characters are now more lively, and environment is more detailed.\n\nenjoy!\n\nI hope to update academy here soon. \n\nThanks again to those who have read!","replies":[]},{"poster":"ULTRAF0RCE","date":"2015-08-28T18:49:22.749+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Really interesting, not sure if it was on purpose but I really enjoyed the nod to metal gear solid with the mentioning of memories that are not that of the person, ala Raiden.","replies":[{"poster":"PBIVRinzler","date":"2015-08-28T20:10:28.881+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the kind words.\n\nI'll be honest, I only have a passive knowledge of the MGS universe (MGR:R, mostly...)\n\nMy assumptions regarding memories stemmed a lot from PROJECT Yi's sounds.","replies":[]}]}]}
