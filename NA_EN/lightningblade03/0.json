So you if you own Jhin, they are forced to give you an epic skin? xD\nWell guys, thanks for answering my question. I hope I get Cosmic Reaver Kassadin once I get enough IP to buy him on my smurf lol.

One with garden and ashe and a random skin for each, and essence. The other chest has a random skin shard for a champion you own, which my question is if you can get a legendary or epic skin out of that chest.","replies":[{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2017-04-16T21:58:02.960+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">The other chest has a random skin shard for a champion you own\n\nThat's not true actually, I got a Riven skin on the second chest and I didn't own her at the time.
