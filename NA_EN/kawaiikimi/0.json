Does anyone know anyway to be able to get RP for other servers? I would love to be able to make my giveaway for everyone and not just NA.\r\nHoping to not have to use PayPal or use an account on a different server(to avoid the overseas fees that come along with it or else I'll rarely do my giveaways) \r\nThanks in advance to anyone who might have any ideas! \r\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-10T00:20:44.960+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's pretty great that you're doing an RP giveaway on your own! Since RP cards are limited to the region that they're bought in, you're probably going to have a hard time gifting out RP to other regions. Paypal is most likely going to be your best option, but check up on our [**payment method**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/203701590) for some other possible methods.","replies":[]}]}
