I can click and hear pictures and champions being selected but all i'm seeing is the role selection screen. This when it was my turn to ban i was aunable to do anything. It then caused a dodge. Also afterwards i couldn't close the client until i went to task manager to end task. Is there anyway to help me with this to get my provisional game back? It doesn't seem right that I lose a game that can affect my placement because of this glitch or bug.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-08T19:57:16.825+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the clip!

The Open beta is where this occurred. But seriously is there anyway to help with this. It don't seem right that I had to dodge because of this and if i remember correctly when you dodge during provision it either counts as a loss or you don't get to play the 10 games so it basically counts as a loss.","replies":[]}]}
