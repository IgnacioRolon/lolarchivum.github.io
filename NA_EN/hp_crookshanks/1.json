Meaning she builds almost no AP. This change hurts AP karma mid and support more, does it not?\n\nDon't you think there are better ways to nerf karma top (Nerf % hp healing on W, for example) than nerfing her AP ratios?","replies":[{"poster":"Ragnaveil","date":"2019-11-12T20:03:08.042+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean, the easist way to fix Karma top is change her W heal and lower the base damages of her Q and RQ. She should have to build AP to deal damage, not be gifted it on a silver platter. Thats why I dont want the ratio going up until that gets fixed.\n\nAs for nerfing her top the right way, ask the balance team. Last time I checked it took them almost half the season to correctly nerf Riven once.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":" Jet Sett RadÄ±o","date":"2019-11-12T18:24:09.132+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"People complain damage supports shouldnt be a thing yet people want to buff the damage on a champion who can build full tank but still half health you top with one q at 15 mins","replies":[{"poster":"SilverSquid","date":"2019-11-13T13:31:56.726+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"If she can build full tank and half you,\nthen her base damage is the problem, not the ratios.\n\nThere is no point in gutting mid Karma because top Karma is too strong.\nPS: As an avid Karma fan for 7 seasons I'd like to say: I despise tank Karma.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Weiss Guertena","date":"2019-11-12T17:59:13.104+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Or even better, bring her back to the drawing board.
