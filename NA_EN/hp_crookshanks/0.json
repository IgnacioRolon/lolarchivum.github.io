Nami doesn&#x27;t.\n\ne.e you realize enchanters are meant to be anti-die champions right... That's why I said she's the only enchanter left. Nami is now the only support champion that can keep a champion consistently alive while allowing the ADC to do the trading. All the other supports right now are either disengage kings that double function as lockdown tanks, like Alistar, Leona, and Pyke (his passive and his E dash allow him to function very well as a damage absorber/disengage unit when required during laning phase). Bounty phases don't play as large of a role as you think, because Nami's W and Ignite will net about the same amount of kills as a Leona's W's shield popping and a Leona's Q's empowered auto. That's not the main issue, it's that everyone hated the enchanter playstyle for so long because they were TOO good at trading and disengage and healing, but now that they've mostly been gutted, Nami's the last one left.","replies":[{"poster":"Illabethe","date":"2018-10-04T15:02:55.683+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"No. Her healing someone has nothing to do with her win rate. It's an ENTIRELY different argument. SHE doesn't die. When I'm playing Nami, I rarely die more than twice.\n\nNami actually sucks at keeping others alive. Meta builds only heal about 1/4 or less of a health bar or less, depending on who it is, and it's on a base 10 second cooldown. So at best, it's a 6 second skill. Ie, in combat, it's not spammable. After she uses it, you have 6+ seconds to kill her/her allies. And that's just in mechanics. That doesn't include diminishing heals from grievous wounds. \n\nSoraka and Sona can BOTH keep people alive better, with what ends up being lower cooldowns and much more influential abilities.\n\nWhen hits are 600-950 regularly, and heals are 272..... the heal is a joke. It rarely saves the target, unless the other team is dramatically behind.\n\nBounties play a HUGE role. Nami can take kills, but not give them back. If Leona or Pyke or Alistar takes kills, they DO give them back. The Nami might net 575 gold in bounties an entire game. Leona will probably net about 1500 gold in bounties (5 kill trades, 5 deaths). Pyke will probably net closer to 2500-4000 in bounties a game, since his entire purpose is to steal kills, and often in sequence. Alistar is iffy and depends on how early the opposing team gets grievous wounds. If they don't, he likely gives 1500 -2000 in bounties. If they do, more.\n\nAlso, Nami generally doesn't take Ignite. She exhausts.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Tormentula","date":"2018-10-04T22:16:18.837+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Idk what you mean by her being an anti death champ, because I cringe when I see nami on my side and I nut when I see her on the other, squishy immobile, slow telegraphed abilities, the only thing really good about her is the W healing and damage. Even her laning phase can end off of one bind or hook. \n\nWhen I'm jungle, nami lanes are usually one of my top priorities due to how easy it is to pick her or her ADC, atleast soraka and lulu can peel for themselves with silence, poly, and instant ults.\n\nI'd say buff the poor fish before nerfing her, she's not good just her W is the only healing and poking potential in bot lane ATM since the other supports were nerfed.
