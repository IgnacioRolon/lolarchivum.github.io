I went into C:\\RiotGames\\...\\LeagueClient.exe and sent to desktop as a shortcut but after I open the client with the shortcut, the client itself is opened as a icon-less application. How do I fix this?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-23T01:55:33.745+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Weeeeiiiiird.....does the client and everything still work normally? \n\nYou should be able to right click on the shortcut, and specify whatever icon you'd like to use as well. Give that a try and you should be able to set it to the League Logo!","replies":[{"poster":"Red XD","date":"2018-01-24T02:18:39.546+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah everything works normally.
