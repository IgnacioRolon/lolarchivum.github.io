Ive now spent the time since then trying out new mids and have came to the conclusion that Riot actually just made this game worse. I mean syndra&#039;s old passive was great, I could care less if m spehere disappears sooner or later I relied on Q for my damage more than ult. \r\n\r\nI went from Malz and Syndra to Karthus, Tf, Viktor. They just have such a different play style","replies":[{"poster":"MisterHealYoGirl","date":"2016-06-07T20:47:16.005+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm actually a huge fan of the changes. Syndra's Q does more damage at all stages of the game (it has a much higher AP ratio, and the bases got buffed, too), and the ult stacking really does show up in lategame teamfights. Plus she has some additional buffs on the PBE right now; higher AP scaling on W and E.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2016-06-07T19:46:12.195+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They buffed the scaling on Syndra's Q to make up for the removal of the old passive buff.\n\nOverall I've been happy with the mage reworks (though Zyra's still a pain to lain against down bot imo).\n\nKarthus and TF weren't changed by the update, so if you're just saying they have different playstyles from the champions you played before, they're supposed to.
