Then it shuts off.\n\nSecondarily, on an irregular occurrence League of Legends flashes the logos then doesn&#039;t start at all, when I check my Task Manager, there are 3 different LoL Patchers running at the same time.\n\nAnyone know what to do about this?\n\nP.S. I'd prefer an answer quickly, this has been happening ever since I re-installed the LoL client roughly 2 weeks ago.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Codebear","date":"2016-11-04T20:00:17.830+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Black k 9,\n\nThanks for the report.  I can look into this a bit, but you might be able to do a temporary fix by repairing the client from the settings menu in the upper right or manually forcing a patch.  To manually force a patch follow the below steps:\n\n1. Go to your League of Legends folder (ex. C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends)\n2. Open your RADS folder\n3. Open the projects folder\n4. Open the league_client folder\n5. Open the releases folder\n6. Inside the releases folder, delete the numbered folder (ex. format 0.0.X.X)\n\nNote: THIS WILL FORCE A PATCH! If that is not the route you'd like to take, I would refrain from doing that and we can work towards a better solution.\n\nAdditionally, I will raise the start up error issue with the rest of the team for additional visibility.","replies":[{"poster":"Black k 9","date":"2016-11-05T04:14:31.497+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks, I appreciate it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Frozen Heroo13","date":"2016-12-31T11:21:52.940+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"hello i have the same broblem but i dont know how to fix can you help me guys?","replies":[{"poster":"Frozen Heroo13","date":"2016-12-31T11:56:18.391+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"i have delete league of leagend bcz i have some broblem and i delete all files..now i cant download again any help?","replies":[]}]}]}
