Leaving still causes others a bad experience, so your lower priority queue can continue to escalate until you show consistency of not leaving games.  If this is an issue for the time being, you'll want to stick to custom games and tune up your network stability.  I don't recommend trying to play League on 3G or a data plan, but our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide can help with general tune ups.","replies":[{"poster":"Baron Leonardo","date":"2017-12-21T10:07:42.440+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I understand that casuses bad experience for others, but that's not fair :/\nIt causes bad experience for me\nsometimes that happens at the mid of the game\nsometimes it happens just after the starting of the game\nthat's something unpredictable -_-\nThere's different between intentional AFK and bad connection\nThere's also some new thing happened more than once\nsometimes the game just need to be reconnected before the game loading screen, whatever how many tries I made (the connection is good at this point), I can't return back, sometimes ping is 0 and sometimes the ping is normal and after like 60% it disconnects again, that happens like 3 times till now.
