When he goes to sheath his sword it doesn't go in the sheath it just floats in the air. I thought maybe he was holding it but his hands aren't on the sword. Also when you have home guard boots and you are running with him his sword kind of pops in and out of his animation. I'm pretty sure its not supposed to look that way.{{champion:157}} {{item:3250}}","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2014-10-17T10:30:20.371+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Thanks for the report!
