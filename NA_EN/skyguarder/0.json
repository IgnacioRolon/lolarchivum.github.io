In this discussion, I&#039;ll include what I think should be nerfed and buffed and how it should be. Let&#039;s start.\n\n{{champion:103}} **Ahri**\nAhri has always been a charming champion. However, her charm isn&#039;t really \"charming\".\n\nE\nNOT CHARMING ENOUGH: Width increased to 9000\n\n****\n\n{{champion:32}} **Amumu**\nAmumu doesn&#039;t have friends. He would have one if Pantheon didn&#039;t block him.\n\nW\nYOU HAVE TO BE MY FRIEND NOW: Despair now ignores all protections (Pantheon&#039;s passive - Aegis protection, etc.)\n\n****\n\n{{champion:34}} **Anivia**\nAnivia is underplayed, so a buff will be necessary in order to bring back her power.\n\nPassive\nI WILL BE REBORN AGAIN... AND AGAIN: Cooldown reduced to .69 seconds from 300 seconds\n\n****\n\n{{champion:1}} **Annie**\n\nAnnie is more of an assassin and evil little girl than a little mage who can be nice... or not. So we chose the evil side.\n\nQ\nTAG, YOU'RE IT: Her Q is now a global skill shot\n\nR\nTIBBERS, YOU'RE MY BEST FRIEND: Tibbers now strangles all enemies, dealing 1000 true damage to those that attempt to attack Annie.\n\n****\n\n{{champion:22}} **Ashe**\n\nSince the Ashe rework, she has had her win rate dropped dramatically to .10%. We think that she could use more buffs.\n\nPassive\nNEVER RUN AWAY PLZ: Slow duration increased to 5 seconds\nSTOP IT PLZ: Slow increased to 90%\n\nQ\nREADY, AIM, FIRE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: Number of arrows increased to 99\n\nE\nWHO'S THERE: Number of maximum hawks increased to 5\nCOOLDOWN: 5 seconds per charge\n\n****\n\n{{champion:53}} **Blitzcrank**\n\nRight now, Blitzcrank is more of an \"I'm a robot and you can't stop me. Haw-haw-haw\". He isn't really a support and more of a lane bully. So here is what will make him more of a \"support\".\n\nPASSIVE\nWHAT HAPPENED: Mana shield is no longer a thing\nNEW PASSIVE: Blitzcrank falls down and laughs his *beep* off whenever he bullies someone in lane\n\nQ\nBUT I'M TOO LAZY TO GET IT: Hook length decreased to 20\n\nW\nWHY, I'M JUST SANIC: Movement and attack speed bonus removed\nNEW ACTIVE: When Blitzcrank activates his command, he activates self-destruct mode. After 1 minute, he will instantly kill all champions on the map and cause an earthquake which has a 9000% (1000% of Blitzcrank's attack damage) of crashing summoners rift.\n\nE\nWANNA GO?: Blitzcrank's punch now pushes enemies off the map.\n\nR\nWHAT THE: His ult now takes a minute to a year to activate\n\n****\n\n{{champion:63}} **Brand**\n\nBrand isn't really following his champion title.\n\nPASSIVE\nIT'S OVER 9000!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: Now deals 9000 damage to enemies who laugh at Brand\n\nR\nWANNA KNOW UNFAIR, PAL?: Now possible to bounce infinitely\n\n****\n\n{{champion:51}} **Caitlyn**\n\nCaitlyn isn't much of a sheriff, she's more of a \"Come here so I can delete you\".\n\nPASSIVE\nDON'T YOU DARE: Every shot will change the game music to Rick Roll.\n\nMore ridiculous buffs and nerfs coming soon!","replies":[{"poster":"SkyGuarder","date":"2015-06-30T01:45:51.325+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"NEW BUFFS AND NERFS FEATURING BRAND AND MORE!\n\n(I'll get to Zyra.

They will continue laughing until they are killed. If you kill a unit infected with Lux's laughter, it is heard globally.\n\n{{champion:17}} **Along the fungal roots**\nTeemo can now travel from one mushroom to any other mushroom on the map.\n\n{{champion:56}} **True nightmare**\nUsing R will make enemy champions see themselves getting attacked by you and even getting their health lowered by your illusion's attacks. All changes in health are illusionary and their skills, items, etc, still act as if they have what their true health is. The illusion disappears when the darkness ends.","replies":[{"poster":"macromite","date":"2015-06-29T22:27:29.418+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"but does the laugh infect globally?","replies":[{"poster":"a rabid cupcake","date":"2015-06-29T22:38:49.792+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nope.
