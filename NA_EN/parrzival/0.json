Look at the person profile, they have been trolling games for a few days and they are still not banned. I would bet they have a few hundred reports too. The system is broken. fortunately I did not get a warning for leaving the game. They went 0/30 on the game I left. Another option would be to allow us to surrender after one minute if things like this happen.
