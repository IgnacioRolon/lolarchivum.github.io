I&#039;ve loved him since release and I was never really sure why until recently. I noticed during a game that I Ekko requires a lot of forethought and familiarity to play well. Then I realized that I was like this in real life, I always want to know whats going on when deciding whether or not to get involved with things. Not just that but I am like to think of myself as a decent former athlete and the mobility that Ekko has makes me think that he would also make a good track athlete. And finally the second chance. The arguably broken part of his kit that more people dislike than like. I always wish to have a second chance since I am pretty socially awkward and usually mess up conversations with people I find cute and would take on a date given the opportunity. \r\n\r\nI&#039;m not sure if I like Ekko because he is what I wanted to be or if Ekko had an imprint on my personality to the point where I became more like a fictional character. \r\n\r\nSo my question to you board reader is which champion is most like you and do you like them because they are like you or did you become more like the champion?","replies":[{"poster":"duhBg0Agmz","date":"2016-12-03T20:29:32.977+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"Aatrox: Useless and a waste of time.","replies":[{"poster":"GULAG 4 U","date":"2016-12-04T02:34:13.797+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Damn it, you beat me to it...","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Tesla Effect","date":"2016-12-03T22:45:40.488+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Viktor, cause he is heavily influenced by the ideals and thematics of Nikola Tesla, which I greatly respect and hold dear.\nhttp://news.cdn.leagueoflegends.com/public/images/pages/vik/img/vik-passive.png\n\nhttp://www.thequotepedia.com/images/05/the-desire-that-guides-me-in-all-i-do-is-the-desire-to-harness-the-forces-of-nature-to-the-service-of-mankind-nikola-tesla.jpg","replies":[{"poster":"Escheton","date":"2016-12-06T18:08:44.658+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Tesla Effect,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=E0U6ETWo,comment-id=0007,timestamp=2016-12-03T22:45:40.488+0000)\n>\n> Viktor, cause he is heavily influenced by the ideals and thematics of Nikola Tesla, which I greatly respect and hold dear.\n> http://news.cdn.leagueoflegends.com/public/images/pages/vik/img/vik-passive.png\n> \n> http://www.thequotepedia.com/images/05/the-desire-that-guides-me-in-all-i-do-is-the-desire-to-harness-the-forces-of-nature-to-the-service-of-mankind-nikola-tesla.jpg\n\nFun fact: Tesla fell in love with a pidgeon.","replies":[{"poster":"Tesla Effect","date":"2016-12-06T23:52:21.299+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Escheton,realm=EUW,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=E0U6ETWo,comment-id=00070000,timestamp=2016-12-06T18:08:44.658+0000)\n>\n> Fun fact: Tesla fell in love with a pidgeon.\n\nHe befriended a pigeon because he lost trust in the humans surrounding him who have betrayed him and his work countless times during his life.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Taeva","date":"2016-12-03T20:57:02.150+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"kindred,'cause she's fucking useless right now","replies":[{"poster":"Ebonmaw Dragon","date":"2016-12-04T01:40:35.141+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Taeva,realm=EUW,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=E0U6ETWo,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2016-12-03T20:57:02.150+0000)\n>\n> kindred,&#x27;cause she&#x27;s fucking useless right now\n\nTHEY ARE*","replies":[{"poster":"Taeva","date":"2016-12-04T17:05:18.738+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"congrats.
