I'm going to ask around on the playonlinux website to see if there is a way to get it to work. What is different about the beta client coding wise? do you know? script programming changes? different dependencies? dotnet or directx framework upgrades? Anything like that could be useful so i can find a work around, as i'm really excited about the beta client.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-11T23:49:32.042+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't have a really in-depth answer for you, since I'm not one of the many talented developers working on the New Client. I know that it's built on Chromium as a base, with a number of other open-source assets as well. If you can gain access to another computer that can run the Beta Client, you can hit the cog icon in the top-right and take a peek at the *about* section to find a list of some of the stuff that goes into the new client.\n\nI hope this helped in some way. ^.^","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Lew","date":"2017-01-10T23:02:58.787+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can still revert back to the old client by clicking the [option ](http://imgur.com/IXSuNGG)before you log in.","replies":[]}]}
