Not on any fault of Riot's mind you, my operating system just doesn't simply like the game. Linux has great programs to emulate windows for situations like these, but crashes are still frequent. One of my league friends has a lap-top that is prone to overheating and blue screening from that. Neither of these things are in our control. But we manage to get the game working just fine for long enough that we are still able to enjoy the game and play it daily.\r\n\r\nHere is the problem though. On more than one occasion my crash or his blue screen, triggers in champion select, or at the very start of a match and the team calls for a remake. This causes us both to accumulate AFK penalties. On a side note, how silly is it that when the game crashes in a way that triggers the error report window, that the game still puts a penalty on, even though the game registers that i crashed. Regardless, I am currently in the lower priority matchmaking queue for 4 more games. And it makes me wonder if i'm going to accumulate more severe penalties from this. While i admit that I've dodged a couple of Queue's in the past, and I've been forced to run AFK from a game once or twice, but the number of those incidents i can count on one hand.\r\n\r\nThere has to be a way to, at the very least, incorporate the crashes into the AFK Penalty system, in a way that if the game crashes or freezes it is registered by the game itself. As far as the heat-death my buddy is suffering, you can't really account for that unless you somehow program the game to register when a sudden shut down of the game occurs, as even ALT + F4 doesn't completely shut down the game, and the game registers that you force closed it out. The only issue i'd see with this, is that a player could simply unplug his machine to trick the system. Perhaps making so that the first three sudden shut downs within a 7 day period don't accumulate penalties within the punishment system.\r\n\r\nNow let me be clear, this is not a rant, I am not upset, I am merely concerned, and want to see how many of my fellow League players have similar issues. Are you a Linux/SteamOS user? Do you have a buggy system that overheats or blue screens in some way? What changes, if any, do you think should be made to the system?\r\n\r\nAs an added note, it is only letting me post this in help and support.

I want to let you know that when you disconnect from a match, the servers aren't getting a connection from you, therefore the Leaver system is not able to determine why you've left, it only sees that you leave. You can find out more on this system [on our FAQ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ).\n\nWhile we have no official support for Linux, I strongly encourage you to take a look at our bigger Linux threads from the boards [here](http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=1946188I) and [here](http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=2020528). \n\nI also recommend your friend reach out to our tech specialists by [submitting a ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and attaching a set of logs using our [Hextech Repair Tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752674-Network-System-and-League-of-Legends-Logs). They'll be able to get assistance in reducing thermal stress on their PC, along with troubleshooting the cause of their bluescreens.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]}]}
