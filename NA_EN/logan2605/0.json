I played a single match today in dynamic Q, and my emblem changed from solo to dynamic. This needs to be fixed, as it does not represent my play style at all.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-28T18:07:01.363+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your ranked emblem can continuously change and update based on the majority of your recent matches.  Unless the _vast majority _of your games are solo, you may receive the dynamic emblem.  We also have a guide on [Ranked Emblem](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209346066-Ranked-Emblems) that I hope might help.  Continue to play solo, and your emblem will update in no time!","replies":[]},{"poster":"CrazFight ","date":"2016-07-28T17:25:08.569+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://gyazo.com/5794615cccc2ca6b98f912273aaa722a.jpg","replies":[]}]}
