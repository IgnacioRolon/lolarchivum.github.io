I&#039;ve never been punished for anything before either. I don&#039;t use chat often, if at all. But today in the one game a day I&#039;ve been playing to have fun I did something I&#039;ll admit was out of the ordinary. I wrote kys. And I also bmed a little. But I did it in just one game. In this past week I&#039;ve been getting back to league I have barely written in chat at all.\r\n\r\nThe chat log reads\r\nCabruh: kysd\r\nCabruh: kys\r\nCabruh: ok dont kys\r\nCabruh: all bot\r\nCabruh: gg\r\nCabruh: u lose\r\nCabruh: haha\r\n\r\nliterally thats it\r\n\r\nso the first 3 lines, when taken out of context, seem like I targeted someone for no reason. Thing is, I meant it jokingly to the person who just dcd from the game. He never really saw it. When he reconnected, I wrote &quot;ok dont kys&quot; kind of as a joking manner to which I meant to tell my other teammates, &quot;oh hes back, we dont have to remake and waste time&quot;. There are understandable frustrations with players who dc and force a remake. If a rioter checks it, theyll see the timestamps check out for when the player dcs and reconnects.\r\n\r\nI&#039;ll admit that I was kind of dickish to write haha and u lose at the end. I don&#039;t know if the system picked up on it but I&#039;ll admit it was kind of wrong, kind of like saying ggez (though lots of people get away with that)\r\n\r\nI just don&#039;t know. When the chat is taken completely out of context and is read by a robot who finds one uncensored 3 letter word and I get a 14 day ban because of it, I just feel a little pushed away from a game I was hoping to get back into on the verge of worlds. I&#039;m in high school, and I know I&#039;m a little bit crude and edgy, but I really love messing around with friends on league. This feels a bit harsh and makes me kind of upset I can&#039;t do that at all for the next two weeks.","replies":[{"poster":"DrCyanide","date":"2018-10-12T02:30:37.837+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"\"kys\" has been earning people 14 day bans for almost 2 years now. \n\nHonestly, it's never ok to write that, even as a \"joke\".","replies":[{"poster":"Lunar Strain","date":"2018-10-12T02:32:06.277+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":9,"body":"He said \"_don't_ kill yourself\"","replies":[{"poster":"UnboundHades","date":"2018-10-12T02:33:46.970+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"and said \"kys\" twice before that","replies":[{"poster":"Faneseeker","date":"2018-10-12T18:29:28.308+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=UnboundHades,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=2iA3503B,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2018-10-12T02:33:46.970+0000)\n>\n> and said &quot;kys&quot; twice before that\n\nits like commits 2 murders and saves a life = all rose right?

Telling me what I can and can't say cause there's some groups with thin skin, isn't okay. Shakespear proved words can carry whatever meaning you want them to have. The fact riot, and many of the kids that take these \"seriously offensive language\" problems as hard as they do, show's me a majority of the staff and player-base is fragile, insecure, and very biased about who they want to allow around them. \n\nSo banning a toxic player so he rerolls a new account and plays with new, fresh players. That's a great plan. So much better than a prison island, perma mutes, or any other number of things.","replies":[{"poster":"Imperial Pandaa","date":"2018-10-12T18:53:29.409+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I never said kids weren't playing.

The main player base, the one that has been with the game through all the changes, has grown up. Riot needs to do the same. Just because kids come online, dosn't mean the rest of us should degregate how we interact with them just because \"kids\". Rules should grow with the community. This game has kept very childish and ignorant rules with the passing of time. And since the players who are \"toxic\" work now, it is viable income to ban these players in favor of the younger ones. Logically speaking, riot is choosing kids over its original player base, i disagree with that ideal. \n \n> If I run a business, yes I would enforce rules I believed to be correct and most likely to net positive business. Rules can change, but they would be enforced until they changed. \n\nSo you'd only look at one side, deem the other's argument void, and permanently reprimand one side constantly? The rules in LoL are not executed by people, they're flagged by bots. Nothing remotely even close to the same. And pretending a game's online rules can even come close to replicating a functioning business model in reality is nonsense. Ever see a kid play GTA? I know of plenty that have. LoL experiences pale in comparison. \n \n> You are misunderstanding something I think. Yes, talk about Varrus and the fact you dislike him, but there are places you can go in detail about why.

Like &quot;Fuck Skarners ults&quot; in Odessey. \n\nWhen they remodel a character, change is ingame lines, add a very trend relevant twist unnecessarily to a character that made no sense to do it with? Highly annoying. I'm sick of SJW bullshit being shoved onto every platform in some fashion. If they wanted a \"gay\" character, that's fine, I frankly don't care who likes what, least of all characters on a game. So make a new one, way more original, and far more welcomed, alot less lazy and forced as well. But for a company to become inflamed when people don't talk about their characters how they want them to, then that's just brow beating and sad. It's forced onto us and it's unwelcomed. \n \nYea, fuck skarn ults in Odessey. I dunno what else to say about them that can be put into English words. \n\n> I&#x27;m not going to assume you meant one thing or another here. The whole &quot;mentally unwell&quot; bit. Mentally unwell though does not grant permission for poor behavior in whatever case and both can be punished; it doesn&#x27;t need to be a who behaved the worse.\n\nThen being mentally unwell dosn't give you a pass to a safe space, online, when nobody agreed to care for the delicate egos of mentally unwell, depressed people.

Another reason I don't accept perma bans for toxic players as logical for any reason whatsoever. \n\n> I was simply making a statement that Riot has already made their stance on the Prisoner Island idea. Which yes, is their opinion.\n\nAnd I'm making a statement in response to that, that's generally how a debate in beliefs and ideal's goes.

Where I'm from, if someone remains unwelcomed on or in your property, you can shoot to kill. You don't always have rules that require authorities. That's what I don't get. Everyone is spineless. Everyone wants big daddy riot to solve all their issues, mentally and physically. It's not going to happen. The rules haven't kept up with the community. Now half the community is extra toxic from this, and the other have is overly sensitive to everything. \n\n> They may not even take them hard, they could simply be an annoyance.\n> \n> Not all toxic players makr a new account though, so there is that.

And until you've made your own account and re-leveled to 30, do not speak for the noobs suck with 4-5 smurfs per game.

Just because kids come online, dosn&#x27;t mean the rest of us should degregate how we interact with them just because &quot;kids&quot;. Rules should grow with the community. This game has kept very childish and ignorant rules with the passing of time. And since the players who are &quot;toxic&quot; work now, it is viable income to ban these players in favor of the younger ones. Logically speaking, riot is choosing kids over its original player base, i disagree with that ideal. \n\nI understand what you are saying, but I will have to disagree. I see growing up as maturing and being able to control your emotions better. I used to be extremely volatile, and retaliatory. I would argue with people over voice on xbox and snap at people in League. Then I realized I wasn't actually having fun, the only thing I was doing was stressing myself out. My language communication with others improved and I started to have fun. Still playing to win all the while. Over the course of college, I grew up and matured. Realizing I didn't need to lash out to have enjoyment.\nYes, I know not everyone is me and perhaps I am some random outlier; but this is my opinion on \"growing up\".\n\n> \n> So you&#x27;d only look at one side, deem the other&#x27;s argument void, and permanently reprimand one side constantly? The rules in LoL are not executed by people, they&#x27;re flagged by bots. Nothing remotely even close to the same. And pretending a game&#x27;s online rules can even come close to replicating a functioning business model in reality is nonsense. Ever see a kid play GTA? I know of plenty that have. LoL experiences pale in comparison. \n\nNo, I looked at both sides and chose one; which is why the rule was made. I determined it was the best rule for my establishment. The rules for LoL were made by people, judged by people, programmed into the bot by people. Uses a machine learning algorithm and also manually updated. Whether you like it or not, the rules are a part of Riots business model. They believe that removing the negative elements is the best move.\nThe system itself just needs improvement.\n\n> \n> When they remodel a character, change is ingame lines, add a very trend relevant twist unnecessarily to a character that made no sense to do it with? Highly annoying. I&#x27;m sick of SJW bullshit being shoved onto every platform in some fashion. If they wanted a &quot;gay&quot; character, that&#x27;s fine, I frankly don&#x27;t care who likes what, least of all characters on a game. So make a new one, way more original, and far more welcomed, alot less lazy and forced as well. But for a company to become inflamed when people don&#x27;t talk about their characters how they want them to, then that&#x27;s just brow beating and sad. It&#x27;s forced onto us and it&#x27;s unwelcomed. \n\nAn attempt to appeal and reach out to more people by giving a \"relatable character\".

I&#x27;m not about to accept double standards on mental illnesses. \n\nAnd alternatively it doesn't give others a pass to be \"jerks\", online, when nobody agreed to put up with their bullshit. \nNow, I'm going to level with you. I don't give a shit about either side of this particular argument. I just want to play the game. I'm mote likely to see the verbal outburst in game and the \"unwellness\" when I try to roleplay in non league games. Do not mistake the not caring for not understanding.

Everyone is spineless. Everyone wants big daddy riot to solve all their issues, mentally and physically. It&#x27;s not going to happen. The rules haven&#x27;t kept up with the community.

Each person's life will require different traits for them to thrive to the fullest for themselves. I think people who spend large portions of their time stuck in their head, keeping everything to themselves, gain alot \"flaming\", i personally just think of it as a damn breaking. There's only so much bullshit a individual can and will tolerate. With the current system, it could take a single bad day, to be permanently flagged as toxic.

Because it needs to be easy and convenient for the company to get browny points. No amount of reasoning will justify a blatant SJW slant for no real reason. Especially just to release to fucking furries that couples will spam till 1.5m mastery. I personally am sick of the money grabbing and the blatant selling out to one group, when honestly, just making a character with that trait being a quality of the characters personality, would feel much less forced, much less idiotic, and alot less rushed. \n\n> And alternatively it doesn&#x27;t give others a pass to be &quot;jerks&quot;, online, when nobody agreed to put up with their bullshit. \n> Now, I&#x27;m going to level with you.

Otherwise I can say you're not playing the champ I want, and that disrupts my peace, therefor I troll. I've honestly delt with that. Of course I became toxic. And I got flagged. And to this day, I still see that kid gaining matches to this day. So clearly to me, this is something I find very toxic in itself. We don't have a set standard. \"mute them\" why didn't they mute me? Why is it all on the accused to do the right things, but there's no room for human error, or forgiveness for WORDS in a competitive seance. I can't agree to this one.\n \n> You could shoot them but alerting the authorities could be the better choice.

I've been in games where nig was thrown around alot, feg, ceunt, and even after reports, I got no confirmation anything happened. I'm uncertain of what would have been done, and I don't really care, I personally think you should be able to talk and say what you want. I think the mute option is there for that reason. I don't see perma bans for toxic players as logical or reasonable, by any stretch of the imagination.

I personally don't see it denting 6% of the banned. Personally I think of it this way, from leveling my own smurf, and from considering what types of people tend to find themselves perma banned. They're not exactly mild people, and I think that passion for this game, regardless of how long they make break away from it, will still play it again.\n \n> Simple, you can&#x27;t. It is point of view for every individual. You may think that it is negative because it removes passionate players.

Some of the best content creators for games, ride a fine line between being negative to the community and being passionate about the game. I think it takes the highstrung and loud people to draw eyes to a game, and get people interested in content based around it. This is an opinion I've formed from watching OSRS streams and whatnot.

My smurf account is what convinced me of this. Playing games with genuine noobs was nice, they see the game freshly and enjoy it as I did back in season two. But then I see \"reformed evelynn\" coming into a game, to flame anyone who's negative, brag about how it's their 13'th account, and i realize that toxic players arn't going to quit playing. They're going to make new players deal with the worst of the worst in this community. I think corraling toxic people in their own Q's would be a more resonable solution, rather than forcing new players to deal with angry assholes. \n\nI'm angry that Riot hasn't noticed this issue after how ever many season. I'm annoyed that it takes 3 flammatory games \"know this as fact thanks to a alt I made just for that reason\" to get restricted, temp banned, then permaed. Actually, after your 2 week, it takes 1 bad game, and you're perma banned. That to me, is nothing short of censorship. Someone said mean things, so you remove the account they said them things on. \n\nI just think perma banning people is a toxic fix to a toxic issue. That's me. And I fully believe they need to revamp their system. I wouldn't dare play as a noob to this game with how horrible leveling games are on a alt. \n\nAlso, keep in mind this is before there's a allchat open for everyone to use.

Thanks for that.\n\nI fully agree that smurfs, particularly toxic smurfs, can completely ruin the new player experience. Riot claims they can detect the genuine new players and split them off from the smurfs quickly, but I'm less than convinced on that one (particularly if said new player is playing with a more experienced friend). I believe Riot has said they're harder on new accounts that act toxic than level 30+ accounts in an attempt to stop toxic smurfs, but I've only ever made one account so I don't know first hand if that seems true.\n\nLets agree that dumping toxic players into the new player population is akin to dumping your sewage upstream of where you get your drinking water - a bad idea and starts to kill off the population. \n\nCorralling toxic players into a separate queue is also called \"Prisoner's Island\", and while it does work to separate the regular players from the toxic players it has a few drawbacks. First, it's very hard for players who get there to ever get back out. They are constantly surrounded by toxic players, which re-enforces the idea that behavior is normal. It also creates worse matchmaking for the players involved due to a smaller queue population. If matchmaking is too bad or takes too long then people would create new accounts in hopes of getting better matches again, which brings us back to the original problem (and makes the queue times even longer for those who stick to their original accounts, making them more likely to smurf as well).

Thanks for that.\n\n>  Not all \"toxic players\" are blind to a line of logic or reason. \n\n> I fully agree that smurfs, particularly toxic smurfs, can completely ruin the new player experience. Riot claims they can detect the genuine new players and split them off from the smurfs quickly, but I&#x27;m less than convinced on that one (particularly if said new player is playing with a more experienced friend). I believe Riot has said they&#x27;re harder on new accounts that act toxic than level 30+ accounts in an attempt to stop toxic smurfs, but I&#x27;ve only ever made one account so I don&#x27;t know first hand if that seems true.\n\n> They don't. I've made a few, for various reasons, and in the first few games, you're with newbs regaurdless. After you get to level 10-15, you'll get other smurfs, but there will be, without a doubt, new players somewhere in the game. I've leveled 2 smurfs since the leveling rework was updated. And neither of them we're consistently in games with other smurfs. Unless I played my onetrick. \n\n> Lets agree that dumping toxic players into the new player population is akin to dumping your sewage upstream of where you get your drinking water - a bad idea and starts to kill off the population. \n\n> Highly agree, and is my main issue with perma banning players for being toxic alone. I also think showing rewards for players who did reform, genuinely did improve ingame with chats and whatnot, with unbanning perma banneds under the \"toxic\" flag, with heavy drawbacks, would be a good way to improve the mentality of the \"toxic community\".\n\n> Corralling toxic players into a separate queue is also called &quot;Prisoner&#x27;s Island&quot;, and while it does work to separate the regular players from the toxic players it has a few drawbacks. First, it&#x27;s very hard for players who get there to ever get back out. They are constantly surrounded by toxic players, which re-enforces the idea that behavior is normal. It also creates worse matchmaking for the players involved due to a smaller queue population. If matchmaking is too bad or takes too long then people would create new accounts in hopes of getting better matches again, which brings us back to the original problem (and makes the queue times even longer for those who stick to their original accounts, making them more likely to smurf as well). There&#x27;s a lot of ways it could fail, making it less than ideal.\n\n> Personally I don't agree. Most people who would be returning to their main accounts, like this one from season two, wouldn't be bothered with them things, so long as we got our old memories returned. That's a personal bias of course, and I personally think having a prisoners' island in the form of a ranked mmr, and a \"jail rank\". Where you can only Q into 1 Q, with the same types of players, until you finish a set amount of games with said community, would be a viable alternative. \n\n> Another popular idea is to prevent toxic players from ever typing.

Like perma banning accounts, and after a set duration, unbanning them, with a strictly monotiered 10 game \"series\" to display non-troll like habits, along with permanently losing access to /all chat, and being default muted by your team, would yeild far more reforms, results, and returns for the company. Frankly, I just don't see perma  banning toxic players, so they rejoin your game with a new account, being a viable form of sustaining a punishment. And even if they're strict about banning toxic smurfs, it takes 2 hours to recoup that lost effort verses mains we had for years. Just my insight on it. \n\n> ----\n> \n> Honestly, I hope Riot tries that last idea. It&#x27;d be interesting to see if it helps both existing players and new players.\n\nI'd just like to see riot acknowledge that how they're doing things now isn't working. And it's showing. People want to deny it left and right, but riot has lost a ton of the steady human players, playing, and is struggling to keep new players coming back, because every low level game has 2-4 smurfs ingame. All guaranteed extra toxic because of a recent ban, or a great day of humaning.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"DeracadaVenom","date":"2018-10-12T21:40:41.529+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ever heard of evelynn","replies":[{"poster":"Heimerdingering","date":"2018-10-12T21:55:13.113+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=DeracadaVenom,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=2iA3503B,comment-id=00060002,timestamp=2018-10-12T21:40:41.529+0000)\n>\n> Ever heard of evelynn\n\n?

But today in the one game a day I&amp;#039;ve been playing to have fun I did something I&amp;#039;ll admit was out of the ordinary. I wrote kys. And I also bmed a little.

There are understandable frustrations with players who dc and force a remake. If a rioter checks it, theyll see the timestamps check out for when the player dcs and reconnects.\n> \n> I&amp;#039;ll admit that I was kind of dickish to write haha and u lose at the end.

Instead of feeling suicidal the game provokes aggression. But no, they&#x27;re all just flawed, dickish humans. Nobody can have alternating reactions to different situations, right? Everyone has to universally agree on how everything should be thought about and felt for. People tend to give a shit about sad depressed fucks with no self esteem, teetering on suicide, but don&#x27;t care about manic bipolar, schizophrenic, ect using a online vent for anger, to supersede doing something in real life?  Either way, you&#x27;re choosing one over the other. Both are very real. And pretending the depressed person&#x27;s feelings &gt; the bipolar persons is a biased and scummy way to decide how you prioritize others metal health. &quot;If you&#x27;re a dick get help&quot; if you&#x27;re gonna kill yourself over a stranger, on a game, typing a abbreviation, then they need help far fucking more than someone talking shit on a game. &quot;We know you&#x27;re mentally unfit to talk to people, but here, socialize with a unfilerable group of different people&quot;. Fucking moronic logic.\n\nRaging and wishing on someone's life cannot be weighted equally. The point I'd like to mention is that we don't know if the other person got banned or not, maybe they did. Toxic behaviours are bannable. Telling someone to commit suicide is a far severe and despiteful offence and motive, regardless of provocation. If you were playing a sport and your opponent starts to taunt you can you kill them? Or arrange some sort of misfortune on their life? yes, they insulted you but your reaction is to take away their life? Common.
