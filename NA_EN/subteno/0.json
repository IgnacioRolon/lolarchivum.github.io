You may haven&#039;t noticed that, Rito, summoners, but for a long time now the rammus voice, taunt, laugh, joke, are all gone. It may be time to fix this, or is it intended that the only thing Rammus says is &quot;OK&quot; at the champion select?

They've already spent the voice actor budget for the next 3 yares on the absurdly long voices that came with the Sion / Karthus updates. They've had to make cuts to the overall length and quality of most voices since then. You can see this in recent updates/releases. The Kass and Ali updates didn't get new voices with their updates (despite being in desperate need of them). Gnar, Rek'Sai and Bard don't have 'traditional' voices just simple noises and some filters. Even the most recent ultimate skin DJ Sona doesn't have a true voice.\n\nBTW that original statement of 'They've already spent the voice actor budget for the next 3 years' is completely falsified. Though you'd be forgiven for believing it given recent trends.","replies":[]}]}
