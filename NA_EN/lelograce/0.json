I bought the second Shyvanna skin, I think it's called Iron Shyvanna? Not sure. Anyways, I spent my money on the 10$ card and got the skin. Problem is, it didn't give me the skin! Wasn't too happy about that at the time, and I'm still not. More importantly,  my game wont launch. Ive tried uninstalling and re-installing many times, but nothing works. I'd really like to get back into league! My windows tries to fix it each time I try to launch, but the game still crashes. I'm honestly upset that I can't play it!! Also, thanks in advance for the help!!  -Leah &lt;3","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-31T18:32:15.954+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For your issue with the missing Shyv skin, you'll need to reach out to our account specialists in a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new), as this will take a bit of investigation to figure out what happened.\n\nAs for your launching issue, can you give me a bit more detail as to what happens?
