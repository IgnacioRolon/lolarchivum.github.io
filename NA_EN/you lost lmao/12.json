Though they can be pretty strong late game, they don't really have a, how do I say, place.\n\nI'd stride for a 1.5x crit for Yasuo. It keeps his power based as an assassin, but it makes it less easy to build tank since you'll want more crit items if you also want damage. \n\nI don't mind Tryn's ulti. A good CC in a team fight turns the invincibility useless for a bit, its a short time too. That makes him a good duelist/assassin because of this. Though I would increase the point of his undying. Instead of 30/50/70 health, I'd like for it to be 55/75/95 because on his Q passive he does more damage with less health. I honestly don't know what champ CAN'T do more than 100 damage at lvl 6.\n\nFor Master Yi, I'm not very sure. You just have to pay attention to him early game because of his high cooldowns early in. On his E I'd just lower the ratio or remove the base damage completely.","replies":[]},{"poster":"YOU LOST LMAO","date":"2016-12-08T02:10:25.280+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=The JigSAW,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=A4gpIUco,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2016-12-08T01:06:47.306+0000)\n>\n> Its a start.  \n> \n> I don&#x27;t think Aatrox needs -anything- done to him since he&#x27;s a health based champion and mostly melee.
