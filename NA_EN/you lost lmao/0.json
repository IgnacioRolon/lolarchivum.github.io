Where are you encountering issues with the client?\n\nsorry just 5 minutes later after the post, the client went back up for me.\n\n I guess I over reacted the situation because this is my first time I had that issue, I have rly good internet connection/network connection (whatever u wanna call it). \n\nI was in champ select and it booted me off and I check browsers and it worked fine it was just the client not working for me.\n\n\nty for responding though","replies":[]}]}]}
