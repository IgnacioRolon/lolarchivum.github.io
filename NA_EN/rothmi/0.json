You make up a rule or stipulation, nothing to crazy, but I thought it would help change your view at the little things. Then you take that rule and apply it to EVERYONE in league, and think about how things like the meta or in general gameplay would change for better or worse!\r\nI'll start:\r\n\r\n* What would it be like in League if every champ had 10 less base AD? or 100 less base health!?\r\n* What would it be like in League if every non ultimate ability had it's cooldown increased by 2 seconds? \r\n* What would it be like in League if every champ started the game with 1000 gold? Or NO gold!?\r\n\r\nJust little fun things that we can make a game of, try it out and join me in my crazy thoughts! Try it out, I dare you!","replies":[{"poster":"Wheatloaf","date":"2014-08-31T00:40:57.910+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":0,"body":"What would happen if minions could buy items?","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Reinboom","date":"2014-09-05T09:21:07.138+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":0,"body":"Troll minions take {{item:3026}}","replies":[{"poster":"Thryale","date":"2014-09-05T11:23:22.857+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do I smell a new special game mode here?\n\n\"rise of the creeps!\"\n\"revenge of the minions!\"","replies":[{"poster":"ShadowCleave212","date":"2014-09-05T17:32:47.533+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Riot Minions!\"","replies":[{"poster":"Neamean","date":"2014-09-05T17:37:51.860+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"more like Minions Riot","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"MrBuffington","date":"2014-09-01T02:59:01.829+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"everyone gets a {{item:3060}}, minion circle jerk.","replies":[{"poster":"The Lexer","date":"2014-09-01T03:24:55.167+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Maybe.
