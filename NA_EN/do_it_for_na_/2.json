Even my teammates were complaining like \" yo wtf, how does he have his ult up so fast\", he only had 20% cdr.\nANYWAY, when I asked the Skarner if he was hacking, he told me to kill my self, to die in a hole, etc. Basically got very mad for no reason, I was just trying to put some closure on the issue. \nI sent Riot a support ticket about this, with screenshots of his toxicity and how the Skarner had  his ult up every 10 seconds.\n\nThis is what they responded with : \n\nGreetings Summoner,\n\nUnfortunately, this content is not currently eligible for our Refund Token system.

I had my internet service go out, and checked everything on my end (pc, router, modem, cables, etc.) so clearly there was something wrong on my providers end. I STILL had to go through a 30 minute process of re-checking my entire setup despite the fact I had already explained to them I had done all those things already, and wouldn't be calling them if it were something I could fix myself. When I was younger, I had about 6 friends that worked the support lines for Bethesda. Everyone pretty much universally hated it, because it was just reading scripts until you fixed the problem, or had to tell the customer they couldn't help. I've had to deal with Blizzard support on several occasions, and while it wasn't a terrible experience, it was clearly the same thing. People reading scripts, giving the same copy/paste answers.  It's not just Riot, it's tech support in general.\n\nAlso, you are suggesting that Riot should fire an employee over one screw up, that, while inconvenient and embarrassing, isn't actually causing anyone major harm. An employee, that up to this point, may have been an ideal, hard working employee that had a single lapse of concentration. Admittedly, they may be a terrible employee that doesn't care about their job, but the point is, we don't know the exact situation. And how do we know this employee hasn't been, or won't be reprimanded for screwing up?

I went ahead and investigated what happened and I have some additional insight I can provide:\n\nWhen our agents answer tickets, many of them have multiple tabs open at the same time.  This way they can very quickly move from one response to the other.  This kind of method isn't without risks as if you accidentally click back to the wrong tab to send a response, you can get a completely random response to your issue, which is what happened here (hence why you got a response about refund tokens).  We train our agents to make sure simple mistakes like this don't happen, but sometimes we royally screw up.  The agent was told about the issue and we're going to make sure this doesn't happen again.\n\nThat being said, there are two other points I want to touch on:\n\n* ***Automated Responses*** -- We do have some automated responses, but they are extremely limited in scope.  The opening line in the automated response clarifies immediately that it is an automated response, and if you would like a human response, you can simply reply back to the ticket.  Otherwise, all of our tickets are handled by a real-life human, which is why these kinds of mistakes do happen.\n* ***Copy/paste Responses*** -- There is no way to sugar coat this, so I'll just tell it to you straight:  We do use macros in many of our responses.  There are two main reasons why we do this:\n * On average, we get thousands of new tickets every single day (in NA alone), not counting the tickets that take multiple responses back and forth that get added on to this.  Our goal is to make sure you get a full resolution within 24 hours of you submitting a ticket, and to hit this mark, our agents need to respond quickly.  These macros are reviewed constantly to make sure that they resolve the vast majority of issues that you all have, and if it doesn't, we re-write it.\n * When answering tickets, we tend to see the same type of issue or question over and over again.  Even if we customized every single response, an agent tends to get very efficient at explaining what the issue is and how to solve it.  Over time, the variance between every response gets less as less as we tend to figure out what works and doesn't work and soon you end up with pre-written responses.  We can absolutely make a push to ensure every response is unique, but then we encounter a trade-off:  More customized response or faster response time?  We have surveyed thousands of players about this, and faster response time wins out almost every single time.\n\nA lot of information to throw at everyone, but I want to be as transparent as I can.  If you have any follow-up questions, reply back and I'll do my best to answer them!","replies":[]},{"poster":"GaleWinUnleashed","date":"2016-06-10T15:09:41.939+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Here's a little bit of perspective: similar to Deep Terror Nami (but on a far lesser scale), I browse around the Boards and respond to people that seem to need help. I type out everything  independently, no copy-paste, but it's mighty tempting sometimes. It's just a hobby/time-sink for me, not a job; nobody is anxiously waiting, unable to play the game, until I can get a response to them.\n\nNow Riot Support actually has a responsibility to the players. The faster they can respond, the more problems they can solve, and more players will be satisfied. Hundreds of tickets per day, per person (at a guess); copy-and-paste is a necessary tool to ensure that they are able to keep up a reasonable pace while still providing sufficient detail to fix the issue. But they're still human; there will be mistakes. Every so often somebody is going to click the wrong ticket, copy the wrong response, send a message to the wrong player, and things will get messed up. But by and large they do a fantastic job plowing through the never-ending ocean of complaints and questions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JhGlass","date":"2016-06-10T11:45:35.845+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"I don't really see why they shoudln't be copy pasting this response.
