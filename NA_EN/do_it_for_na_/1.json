If this continues to happen even in normals or custom games as well, make sure to complete all of the steps in our [Connection Issues Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664).  There are a lot of steps there, but they are crucial in hopefully resolving this issue.\n\nLet me know if you are still experiencing issues at all!","replies":[{"poster":"Do It For NA ","date":"2016-06-07T01:34:58.129+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No it doesn't happen in normals or customs at all, I was playing all day and it was fine, but when I decided to play ranked like an hour ago I got a black screen after 10 seconds into the champ select. When I moved my mouse around, the tooltips for stuff still popped up like \" friends list\" etc, just could not see anything. So after I waited the 5 min and re-queued, this time I did not get a black screen but instead the client just exited by it self and I lost 10 lp and now I am still waiting to queue up again, had to wait 35 min in total and am at negative 13 lp =/=\nNot a connection issue, just your shit fuckin up as usual","replies":[]}]}]}
