My wifi is working so well, but the game just say \"you have DISCONNECTED, please RECONNECT\" and repeating the whole thing again. I do not know why so please answer.\r\n\r\nps. Will you get AFK if the game crash? Crash is different then leaving the game right? I got afk because it CRASHED.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-13T23:44:44.799+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The game will recognize crashes the same way as AFK's and leaves. You aren't currently connected to the game so, for the most part, the same rules apply since the four other players were still left without a fifth teammate. \n\nLet's see if we can get those connections smoothed out a bit to make sure you don't get hit with any penalties. Let's first try checking out your [**network settings**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) for anything that might be a little off. Test those changes in a custom or practice match, and hit me back up if you don't see any differences!","replies":[]}]}
