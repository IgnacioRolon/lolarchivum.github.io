Zac's is very different from what was seen in Renekton's splash, and same with Battlecast Kog'maw in Creator Victors.  I think they really need to keep them a bit consistent.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"bearded squid","date":"2015-07-01T21:06:09.861+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"on thta note there is also pool party orianna nidalee vayne ahri ezreal and riven and diana that would be need to be made from the pool party splashes","replies":[]}]}
