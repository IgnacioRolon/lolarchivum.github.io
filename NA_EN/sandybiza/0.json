BUT they are no where to be seen within my loot inventory, I didn't get any of that stuff, so I bought a random chest thinking I filled the inventory to the max, so then I unlocked it and got Sad Robot Amumu and it appears in my inventory. How do I get back the loot from the Honor Capsule I opened?","replies":[{"poster":"SandyBiza","date":"2017-12-17T16:45:36.560+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"NVM , turns out the champ and skin unlocked itself automatically and now exists within my collection.
