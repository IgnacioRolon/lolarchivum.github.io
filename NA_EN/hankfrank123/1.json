Maybe, if overextended, side of top or bot bush. Bot has one area to gank from, which is top, so only 2 wards to cover 2 people from a jungler. Meanwhile, Top you can:\r\nGo through botside wall\r\nGo over botside bush w/ blast cone\r\nCome in from behind tribush\r\nCome in from Krugs tribush\r\nCome straight up river\r\nAnd for someone CC heavy, like Warwick or Rammus, you would need to sprinkle wards all over the river to even hope of making it possible to not get ganked. Don&#039;t even get me started on Kayn.\r\nSo as most top laners have little non-targeted mobility, sitting on top lane and camping your top is almost always the best way to jungle. How do you play top if you have to throw away a full item&#039;s worth of control wards to stop this turtle from violating you?","replies":[{"poster":"Zallamance","date":"2018-05-05T03:28:48.316+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Isn't the top side and the bot side mirrored and flipped?
