Is Starsurge bugged, or is the champion reveal page misleading?\r\n\r\nthanks\r\n\r\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[{"poster":"Evewynn","date":"2016-04-07T03:16:08.294+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"A rioter commented that the delay is working as intended.\n\nAs sucky as it feels, Sol is actually a pretty good champ (albeit hard to get use to) and removing the delay would probably mean him getting nerfed again.","replies":[{"poster":"Communist Toast","date":"2016-04-07T04:34:24.101+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it is working as intended, just not working as it's written :P","replies":[{"poster":"Evewynn","date":"2016-04-07T05:31:27.561+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree that communicating this fact should have been done more clearly.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Rockm Sockm","date":"2016-04-07T03:40:29.623+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":6,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Ayketh,realm=NA,application-id=LqLKtMpN,discussion-id=nLTt54oV,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-04-07T03:16:08.294+0000)\n>\n> A rioter commented that the delay is working as intended.\n> \n> As sucky as it feels, Sol is actually a pretty good champ (albeit hard to get use to) and removing the delay would probably mean him getting nerfed again.\n\nSol is a good late game champ that requires team work and does not fit the meta.\n\nHow would instantly activate his stun help his lack of mobility in lane lead to more nerfs? \n\nHis kit already has enormous drawbacks to offset his strengths. \n\nHe is a niche pick at best.","replies":[{"poster":"Evewynn","date":"2016-04-07T04:20:43.032+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Well it would greatly help alleviate his main weakness, which is getting dived on, thus making him safer and therefore better.
