The most impressive or detrimental (whether you are a fan of giving incentives in the playoff for seasonal play) feature of this is that First place throughout the season is automatically in the Playoff Finals. 2nd place is automatically in the Semi finals. 3/4 are the first quarter-final. So the winner of the Quarter Faces 2nd place.

Rewarding a team for Best of 1s, is not a good option.

And they are rewarded with whatever place they got in the playoff.\n\n>if they get beat by a team that just comes on late in the season or only plays well against a select few teams or only in the current meta.\n\nA team that adapts and performs when it counts shouldn't be rewarded for making the playoffs and beating a higher seeded team?

Would I like to see NA/EU adapt a Best of 3 regular season and an LCK-esque Gauntlet Playoffs to award teams that play extremely well in the regular season.
