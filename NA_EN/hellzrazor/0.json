Is this on the legacy or updated client?  Your screen freezing and being unable to alt tab could suggest some hardware issue, or something making your hardware misbehave.  To help make sure your client is in good health, run a repair with the [hextech repair tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367) to make sure everything is in order.  Try again afterwards, and let me know what happens.","replies":[{"poster":"Hellzrazor","date":"2017-04-21T22:49:15.347+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I ran the repair tool and i get the same result.
