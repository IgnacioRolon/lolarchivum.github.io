(c:\\riot games\\league of legends\\rads\\projects\\league_client\\releases\\0.0.0.56\\deploy\\plugins\\rcp-be-lol-champ-select-legacy\\rcp-be-lol-champ-select-legacy.dll) I can queue up for a match but never connect to a server.  It just says that a player declined ready check and lags before putting me back into queue.","replies":[{"poster":"Peacey","date":"2017-03-08T15:28:59.073+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is happening to me as well.  I would go onto League and it says it couldn't do the new update so it reverts me back to an older one.  After this I am stuck in a loop of trying to get it patched but nothing works.  I can't even login, it starts at the launcher and repeats, continuously asking me to restart League so it can do the patch.  Which of course I do, but to no effect.  My sister was having the save problem and after trying who knows how many times, she chose to uninstall and reinstall league.  I don't know if this work since it still reinstalling.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-08T17:24:44.579+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What does the error say exactly, is it an error code 004?  It sounds like your patcher is failing to establish a connection, so a reinstall won't necessarily fix this. Instead, your best bet would be to run through the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to resolve anything that may be blocking the connection to our patching servers from being made.  I hope that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"Peacey","date":"2017-03-08T20:04:21.367+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It wasnt' a connection issue, tripled checked that.  The issue was one file that was picked up by my Webroot antivirus.  Once I allowed that file everything worked smoothly.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-08T17:19:13.386+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been seeing a few reports on this and looking for similarities, and I'm curious if this is being caused specifically with Webroot Secure Anywhere.   You should be able to allow an exception through the software itself, but our [patching issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202969434-Patching-Issues) guide can offer some steps as well to allow league as an exception.  \n\nThe most frustrating part is for those that accidentally removed the file.  In these cases, a [reinstall ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202539040-Reinstalling-League-of-Legends) will be necessary to repair the game files.

I had my antivirus remove the corrupted file, put it under the trusted list, and then deleted the old launcher.
