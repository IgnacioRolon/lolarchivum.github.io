I have never had this problem with any other game and I can play games like Fallout 4 and csgo smoothly and what makes the league experience even worse is that usually with high temperatures comes insanely high ping that destroys my connection, upwards of 500+, but in csgo i can easily get ~50 ping all day every day, and even if it couldn't get any worse the ping makes the game unplayable and i have left so many matches because of this dilemma.\n\nmy (bad) specs \ngpu - gtx 560 ti\ncpu - amd fx 4130 quad core \n8 gb of ram  \n\nis there any simple fix i'm not finding or is it just time for a new pc?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-24T17:28:39.444+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Generally, lag spikes like this could be due to network issues like packet loss.
