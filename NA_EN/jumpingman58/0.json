There I learned, thanks to a very helpful templar iytsuna, that my ticket was in the wrong spot and that it would have to be recreated, which was done for me by iytsuna.  I was then informed that the expected wait time for my ticket would be 30 hours, which is a very long time, however, knowing that it would take 30 hours I am okay with waiting that long. What I am not okay with is waiting over 24 hours to receive a response when there is no indication that it should take that long.  Why is it that someone can tell me at a moments notice what the expected resolution time is on a ticket is, yet it takes going in and actually talking to someone in live support to get this information? Why is it not just given to us, your customers, when we submit a ticket? I mean is it really that hard to put an estimated resolution/response time in an automated email that goes out after a ticket is submitted?  It is something very minor but something that would help ease tensions around support tickets and keep the \"customer\" happy. Just a little rant I guess.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-17T22:18:08.648+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Feel free to rant buddy! Sometimes that's where the best ideas come from tbh ^_^! I appreciate your passion about this idea, and I'm going to do my best to pass this along to the right people who can hopefully make this happen.","replies":[]}]}
