Currently we are around Gold Elo in flex que. With Solo Ques in both Gold and Plat. We are a pretty chill group in the age range of 19-23, who want to learn more about the game and improve. We are all on the East Coast aside from our coach, Diamond 3, who is Central time in NA. We are currently signed up for an Amutuer league with games taking place Friday and Saturday nights. We practice every weeknight from 11pm-1am Eastern. Our adc dropped out due to complications and we are interested in finding a new adc so we can play in the leauge which starts Friday and will be streamed on twitch. Add me on League Ign: TDS Emeraldz or post here if you interested.
