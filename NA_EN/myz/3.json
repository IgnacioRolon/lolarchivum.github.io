WORST game of 2015.","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] General Discussion","up_votes":16,"down_votes":75,"body":"Only fun for 10 years old who never played any actual good games and or don&#039;t have more than 10$ allowance per month to spend.\r\n\r\nShitty indie game, here are some good indie games for you game culture:\r\n\r\n- Kingdom ( just came out too )\r\n- 7 days to die ( still in development, but many big updates since kickstarter, developers very open to discussion )\r\n- Rust ( major game overhaul were made since release, still working on it )\r\n- ARK: Survival Evolved ( Updates every day, going as up as 4-5 updates per day, if you have limited internet you might want to stay away until more stable build is out ) \r\n- Nether ( Survival with PVE emphasis, major update coming around Halloween, game is still in early access, but no bugs and in a very playable state )\r\n- Naval Action ( Realistic ship battles, very good graphics but closed community due to sending keys in wave after purchase )\r\n- Rebel Galaxy ( spaceship, nuff said )\r\n- Craft the world ( dungeon keeper + sandbox + terraria = win )\r\n- Offworld trading company ( gameplay is still slightly basic, but looks very promising, minus the price, pick up on sale )\r\n- Planetbase ( city builder in space )\r\n- Banished ( city builder in colony time, has workshop )\r\n- Landmark ( Building game with MMO PVP )\r\n- The war is mine ( 2D game about how you survive in a world plagued by war )\r\n\r\nI could go on and on for hours like this looking at my steam library. Stop playing shit games.\r\n\r\nThanks.","replies":[]}
