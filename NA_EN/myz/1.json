Only need walker assault, supremacy, squadron, blast &amp; like 1 fun mode like droid or drop zone.\n\nAlso why add single players missions ? They&#039;re boring, feel like a task more than a fun thing to do. If you wanted to make a singleplayer, just make walker assault playable in single players or put a shitty story mode to please the crybabies. \n\nAlso no ranking, no competitive game mode ... Waste of 100$ for ultimate edition.\n\nRiot is 100x better than EA in any department, people should stop complaining about Riot games.","replies":[]}
