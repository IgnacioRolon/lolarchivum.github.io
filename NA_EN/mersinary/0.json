This could/would/does allow players to better report and support evidence of trolling, griefing, intent feeding, etc... As the title says, there just needs to be better ways to report people/players that are intentionally feeding, griefing, afk&#039;ing, not contributing, trolling, etc...I&#039;m not referring to an in-game / after-game report system, but more a out-of-game feature that could allow you to attach video content of evidence.\r\n\r\nI just spent the last 30-60 minutes trying to go through the submit a request/ticket, and theres literally no options to report people. And what I&#039;ve found through searches tells you report a ticket through whatever (support &gt; submit a request &gt; I have a question about... &gt; game and features) and it just brings you to the boards, not to submit an actual ticket.\r\n\r\nSo long story short, (or short story long...) I was the jungler, and Anivia was our top laner (the troll). We&#039;re 9 minutes into the game, she pings for assistance top lane. We&#039;re blue side...I&#039;m already at wolves, I go sit by the blast cone, and enemy Udyr is on his way top lane as well to gank. Unfortunately miss my Q (bandage toss) on Udyr, so I run around trough tribrush and up into lane into wall brushes. By this time Udyr is already gone, Anivia was safe and barely damaged. Enemy top laner Tahm Kench is about 35% health, at this time I&#039;m in top lane middle brush. Anivia is just sitting there now, not farming, not moving, nothing, I figured shes just like playing possum cause I&#039;m sittin there, Tahm moves closer, I land my bandage toss, ult him, he&#039;s about 10% health now, Anivia just moves backwards towards ally turret...\r\n\r\nAnivia claims I didn&#039;t try to (counter)gank, regardless she was still 75% after Udyr left, I was in her lane and tried to kill Tahm while she just sat there and began trolling. Tahm would have died if she had even attempted to cast any of her abilities.\r\n\r\nSo after that Anivia sits top turret, roams to inner turret, afk&#039;s some more, just sits there...All in the span of about 3-4 minutes. One minute later, she clears wolf camp, then heads towards dragon fork between mid lane and dragon, sits there, enemy Fizz comes up and kills her. Anivia doesnt respond in any way, no abilties casted, just sat there...Other moments team fights are happening, Anivia is just dropping ice walls on our team to prevent escapes, basically griefing and assisting enemy team. Other times when I&#039;m recalling shes dropping ice walls on me to prevent my recall.\r\n\r\n......Overall, I&#039;d say we had a good shot at winning this game...The game itself still lasted 35 minutes. Now if Anivia was actually playing we very possibly could have won maybe sooner or around the same time the game originially ended, or even if the game lasted another 15-20 minutes who knows what woulda happened. Overall, who knows what woulda happened if Anivia didnt troll for 25 minutes of the game...But we sure as hell woulda had a chance of winning, instead of a waste of time game that lasted 35 minutes cause 2 people hit no on the surrender each time.\r\n\r\nAnyway, not trying to rant, just trying to tell my story...And if a Riot staff/dev/support reads this, I&#039;ve love to hear back from you in form via open ticket request if possible.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nMersinary","replies":[{"poster":"Sarutobi","date":"2017-05-14T13:16:40.505+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The main reason why something like this couldn't be implemented is because of how manipulative people can be especially with video editing. I mean if you give them a bunch of edited content and only go by that obviously the odds will be against you. Now if you are just strictly talking about just giving the files that are already on the game and cannot be edited i can see that working, but then someone needs to watch this and there is no way even a group of people could watch that many games trying to find trolling/feeding in a timely manner. Its just impossible. This is why i hope when the new Tribunal comes out something like this can be an option when it comes to reporting people.","replies":[]},{"poster":"breakordoom444","date":"2017-05-14T12:37:30.812+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"wow, tahm top is still meta?","replies":[]}]}
