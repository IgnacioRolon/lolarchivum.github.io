It can run just about anything I throw at it with no problems (witcher 3, battlefield one, for honor, etc), but league of legends recently started causing the computer to reboot. It happened once while I was in a game and then after that, every time I opened the application, the computer automatically rebooted. Not sure what to do about it. No other game is causing this to happen. Any help would be much appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-08T21:32:06.501+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh wow, yea that's definitely no good if League is forcing your pc to restart.
