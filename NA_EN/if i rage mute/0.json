Sure, what they did was wrong, and if they had done it the right way it might have led to a better fight, but what I never did was try to see the things that I did wrong.\r\n\r\nAfter switching over to chess and going up in Elo to what master level would be in League I started thinking to myself. &quot;why is it that I can hit master level elo on chess but I cant get past Gold league On LoL?&quot; I started to think long and hard about that for a good while.\r\n\r\nTHEN IT HIT ME. \r\n\r\nWhen I would play chess I would have absolutely no one but myself to blame for my loss and would use an analyzer (basically a computer that would tell you the better moves of the game you finished) to tell me what my mistakes were and where I messed up. \r\n\r\nBecause chess is a 1v1 game I had no other choice but to take full responsibility for my loss and blame no one but myself which led to me being focused on improving only myself. \r\n\r\nI had finally found my true flaw on league........ Worry about no one but yourself.\r\n\r\nAnd when I say only yourself, I don&#039;t mean ignoring to go help your teammates in fights or objectives. What I mean is When searching for mistakes throughout a game, ONLY focus on the ones that you had control of changing in that game. Focusing on mistakes you had no control over has nothing to do with your skill level and is simply part of the game. Search for mistakes you had control of changing. because on average out of 100% of the mistakes in the game, you had control of correcting 20% of them (1 out of 5 on a team). So that means that out of 100 mistakes in a game. You need to find and focus on the 20 of them that you could have changed. The hard part is finding those 20.\r\n\r\nSo on my 7th account, that I hit 30 on 2 months ago, I decided to take this approach to my gameplay. I am still a little shocked as to how big a change it made because I never in my life expected my negativity change to have this big of an impact.\r\n\r\n**In the past 2 months I have achieved Diamond 2**\r\n\r\n Ya I said it. Diamond 2. I spent 4 years pointing fingers, getting banned, tilted, and angry only to achieve gold league. Little did I know that all of that negative bullshit was holding me back almost 1000 elo. Insane right?? \r\n\r\n**BEING A NEGATIVE PLAYER SET ME BACK 1000 ELO!!!**\r\n\r\nSo my message to everyone is this. \r\n\r\nFocusing on others mistakes is a waste of time and energy and only leads to tilt.\r\nFocusing on your mistakes is a good use of time and energy and only leads to self-improvement.","replies":[{"poster":"Samflash3","date":"2016-03-13T22:38:44.496+0000","up_votes":93,"down_votes":0,"body":"Obviously they cant ban the 7th since there are only 6 bans in League of Legends","replies":[{"poster":"Cardmant","date":"2016-03-14T18:00:14.139+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't get it, can someone explain?","replies":[{"poster":"Dramos","date":"2016-03-14T18:06:50.032+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Reference to the champion select and all the discussions that you can only ban 6 champions from 129 (with the Star Forger: 130).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shloonz","date":"2016-03-16T16:52:48.175+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Looks like you missed the joke... missed{{champion:105}} {{champion:105}} {{champion:105}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"HighH1","date":"2016-03-14T05:27:27.334+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Took me a while to get. +1\n\nDon't know how to post upvote GIFs,someone post 2. 1 for me.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Oh Look Kaede","date":"2016-09-08T19:11:36.096+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"IreliaCarrlesU","date":"2016-03-15T00:20:32.343+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"U WIN","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"redniwediS","date":"2016-03-13T18:54:38.306+0000","up_votes":64,"down_votes":3,"body":"The funny thing is people offer this as advice all the time around here.\n\nUnfortunately people often need to learn things themselves before they are willing to accept a truth like you've discovered.
