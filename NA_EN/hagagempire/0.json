If you don't own a champion (in this case Graves) and that champion is currently on sale, then you will be unable to purchase any skins in the Lunar Revel shop that include that champion.\n\nThere are two ways for you to fix this. You can either purchase Graves separately for 50% off (or with IP), or you can wait until Graves is no longer on sale.","replies":[{"poster":"Infernus Killer","date":"2016-02-01T19:59:02.811+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When the Graves sale ends?","replies":[{"poster":"Zombiemaster","date":"2016-02-01T20:16:21.667+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Infernus Killer,realm=EUNE,application-id=LqLKtMpN,discussion-id=jPlATczP,comment-id=0001000000000000,timestamp=2016-02-01T19:59:02.811+0000)\n>\n> When the Graves sale ends?\n\nToday is the last day, so he will no longer be on sale on February 2nd.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-02-01T21:28:49.504+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're on top of this, haha.

I know it is not exactly the right post to comment on but I've got no choice. My lunar revel shop is not working for 5 days now and I coulnd't get any rioters to help on the issue. Commented under posts with same problem and even created a discussion myself but still got no feedback. The shop icon is there but it won't stop loading so I couldn't access the lunar shop anymore. I even bought rp to unlock the skins and now I'm nervous that the shop will close down before I get to solve the problem. Even a \"we are on it\" will be ok for now.

Or, are you able to click on that button and the store doesn't load at all?\n\nAs a heads up, the shop is sticking around until February 8th, so you still have some time before we close up shop (heh).","replies":[{"poster":"Rumpdedum","date":"2016-02-02T22:29:35.607+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for replying.
