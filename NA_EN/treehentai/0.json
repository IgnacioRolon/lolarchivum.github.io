(Typically C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends)\n- Scroll down until you find \"LeagueClient.exe\" and delete the file.\n- Open the client by using \"lol.launcher.admin.exe\"\n- Repair the client by selecting the “?” button in the top right-hand corner of the Patcher window (the first window that appears) and under the options menu, select Repair.\n\nThis will force the patch to fix up any bad game files as well as repair any issues loading the updated client.  If the issue persists then there could be a security setting blocking the client from loading.  Let me know if the issue persists, and we can go from there.","replies":[]}]}
