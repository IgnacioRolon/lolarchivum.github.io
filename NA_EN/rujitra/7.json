Thus, you should climb. Let's also say that the chance any player in your current rank is a troll, afks, feeds their lane, whatever is 10% or 0.1.\n\nIt follows that the chance you have one of these players on your team is the following:\n\n>0.1\\*0.1\\*0.1\\*0.1 + 0.1\\*0.1\\*0.1\\*0.9 + 0.1\\*0.1\\*0.9\\*0.9 + 0.1\\*0.9\\*0.9\\*0.9 OVER 0.9\\*0.9\\*0.9\\*0.9\n\nOr about 12.498%. This is because if you play consistently, then there is no chance you are a troll, thus we only have to consider your four teammates. We add up all possible outcomes (the chance 4 teammates are trolls, the chance 3 are, etc.) And divide by the chance that *none* is a troll to get the ratio of games you will have at least one troll in.\n\nNow, let's consider the chance those players are on the enemy team:\n\n>0.1\\*0.1\\*0.1\\*0.1\\*0.1 + 0.9\\*0.1\\*0.1\\*0.1\\*0.1 + 0.9\\*0.9\\*0.1\\*0.1\\*0.1 + 0.9\\*0.9\\*0.9\\*0.1\\*0.1 + 0.9\\*0.9\\*0.9\\*0.9\\*0.1 OVER 0.9\\*0.9\\*0.9\\*0.9\\*0.9\n\nThis amounts to 12.499%. **This statistical fact holds true no matter what the proportion of trolls is in your rank.** The likelihood of a troll on the enemy team will **always** be higher than on your team, which means over hundreds of games, you **will** climb.\n\nBut we started off assuming that you *weren't* climbing - we assumed that you play above your rank and the only reason you aren't climbing is because of these trolls. We have proven that trolls have no factor on your rank, and that in fact you will win 0.001% more of your games **simply because the enemy has a troll** than you lost because you have a troll.\n\nAs such, there is a contradiction - we've proven that trolls actually make you win more games than they make you lose, which makes you climb, yet we assumed that you were not at your deserved rank and not climbing *because* of trolls. This cannot be the case, and thus one of three things must be true:\n\n* You are not *not* at your deserved rank, thus you *are* at your deserved rank.\n\nOr\n\n* You are not climbing for some reason other than trolls (or afks whatever). Well the only thing other than your teammates that affects your climb is you...  thus we must assume you are not climbing because of you...\n\nOr\n\n* You yourself are a troll, and thus our assumption you are not in our maths is wrong, thus the maths failed. Though, if you're a troll, there's a 100% chance of a troll on your team, and thus that's the reason you lose so..\n\nQuod Erat Demonstratum. Trolls are not a factor in your rank.\n\n****\n#Limitations:\n\n* Doesn't factor into account that this is statistics of infinity, thus obviously some players will experience differently, especially over 10s of games. However, the more games someone plays, the more closely this will approximate their teams, thus the less chance that trolls are actually impacting them negatively is.\n\n* Doesn't take into account that the player in our case, the one we said was consistently two ranks above their skill, is not consistent, period. No player plays exactly the same each game for a variety of factors. However, this is a again a reason that can only be blamed on the player, not others.\n\n* Does not take into consideration the chance another player in the game is playing above or below their skill. The math to prove this is exactly the same, but requires considering upwards of 2^9 configurations if we assume the player is constant or 2^10 configurations if we factor in the chance the player plays above or below skill. That's way too long for a post and honestly I can't be arsed to type it out, so I'll leave that to you to prove for yourself if you so desire.\nThere are some neat tricks to control the number of cases you have to deal with in this analysis and make it manageable, and if you look closely, you'll see that the proof is exactly the same thus the result is the same.\n\nGood luck on the rift!","replies":[{"poster":"PurpleYukari","date":"2019-02-22T04:28:09.733+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"But trolls are more **visibly** common on your team because enemy team trolls isn't directly visible often if they are on the enemy team, unless they take it to all chat or try to throw the game.

It is fully possible that trolls are the reason someone doesn't climb. That possibility just becomes increasingly unlikely the more they play. However, real human beings should not be expected to gamble their time and patience on appearing to be good at a video game, because human time and patience are limited. Using this math to say \"pff, don't blame the trolls, it's your fault that you can't climb\" is supremely short-sighted and just drives people away from the game after they exhaust their time and patience.\n\nWe should be commiserating and empathizing with those unlucky players who frequently get stuck with trolls, not slapping them down with \"it is mathematically impossible for trolls to be impeding your progress.\"","replies":[{"poster":"TrulyBland","date":"2019-02-22T17:42:09.185+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":">That possibility just becomes increasingly unlikely the more they play\n\nAnd it becomes very unrealistic very quickly.

That happening four games in a row would then be 0.23%, roughly 1 in 400.\n\nFor comparison, the chance that the enemy team has more trolls than your team are:\n\n1-5 trolls vs 0 trolls: 24.2%\n2-5 trolls vs 1 troll: 2.1%\n3-5 trolls vs 2 trolls: 0 % (rounded)\n3-5 trolls vs 3 trolls: 0% (rounded)\n\nSo about 26.3%. The chance here that four games in a row are skewed in your favour 0.48%. Which while still small, is more than twice as high as the chance to have four games in a row favouring the enemy trollwise.\n\nThat's another thing: Even though the difference between trolls in your team vs trolls in the enemy team may be small for a single game, when you look at larger events with more games that difference steadily increases. It doesn't just become less likely to be influenced negatively by trolls, as you increase the sample size, it becomes *more* likely that you are being influenced positively by trolls.\n\n>This thread tries to say that trolls aren't a factor in a person's rank when that is patently false.

And perhaps because they also understand that \"bad\" or \"inexperienced\" players are trolls (inexperienced is a metaphor for like how Yassuo ints and doesn't think he did it.).\nTheir ego happens to be too big. Such happens the higher elo they are and the less time they've spent on it. To error is human, but these kind of people \"do not have time to lose due to it\". Yeah, I understand it's tilting that you lost because of him, but winning/losing that single game isn't a synonym to \"unable to climb\". Even Yassuo stated it himself: \"You will lose games because of your teammates, but it's not because of them that you can't climb.\". \n\nSo far, I only ever found 1 real Troll in my team, who picked Teemo with Ghost and Cleanse as soon as I banned his Lee Sin accidentally. I dodged, thankfully, and it used to be on bronze elo. Several weeks later, I saw that same motherf*cker at bronze I, while I was II. This motivated me to climb a heck of a lot faster, and just surpass that triggered Troll, and I made it into Silver II.\n\nSide story apart, there is also data about how people usually hate losing 2 times more than they like winning. In the climb, a person is focused on gaining LP, however, if you break it down to the simplest (at least on my side), when I play ranked, I win so I don't lose LP. Winning LP happens to be a side-effect to that (since you can't draw).\n\nDue to this \"hate\" for loss, the human nature of players force them to find something to blame even amidst the game. While I don't see myself as a flamer, when I see bot dying twice, I think to myself \"Our bot is going to *cost* us the game!\". *cost*. As in \"losing the game\", different from \"losing the win\". I know they sound similar, but to me, they're different, at least try to see it from my point of view.\nEven as I type this, whenever I try to make premises and conclusions, these are the two that I first I thought: \"If I don't win, I lose\"; \"If I lose, I won't win.\". These were accidentally the same for me, but were what I was most worried about.\n\nI know all this I am saying seems basically just one side with its one argument, but it holds true in terms of dominance of my thinking behavior, and I am sure I am not the only one.\n\nHeh, if you actually think about it, we blame others so we don't blame us in order to feel decently good and still be able to play. \n\nGoing back to topic, as a \"what-if scenario\" where you use the 10%, this is an amazing work of math. Obviously, the percentage of Trolls in the literally sense of the word is significantly lower, and as a conclusion to my arguments, some of the \"trolls\" are just bad players, or players having a bad game. \n\nImma be real sad if what I'm saying turns out to be super uncoherent between sentences, lmao. Hope you all understand what I am saying.","replies":[{"poster":"TrulyBland","date":"2019-02-23T17:02:58.672+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">The only reason this post is getting down voted is because of some people's fragile egos.\n\nIn all fairness, I pondered for a long time whether I should downvote it.\nNot because I disagree with the conclusion, but because the math is so flawed that one of the intermediate results is down to less than a third of what it actually should be.\n\nNo matter how true the conclusion, if it is drawn from faulty reasoning it makes for a bad argument.\nAnd while I myself decided not to downvote (or upvote) the OP I think it's at least possible other people were less lenient than me in this regard and downvoted the OP despite the fact they agreed with the point that was made.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"OctavGaming","date":"2019-02-22T20:24:51.960+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your math is correct, but it stands true just in chanp select, in game there is another story. You have a 12.498% of having a troll and if that happens when entering in the game it will troll by being afk which doesnt really do much or by feeding and here is what happens. If you get a feeder the enemy will get more kills and gold as we all know and then will get ahead in items and because your team doesnt have mr, armor etc. or anything to help them stay alive and not die constantly the rate of winning starts going down. That is why the win rate is low.

It's nice to hit gold for the victorious skin (which I have done despite being a 'troll'), but otherwise, I don't really care what division I am in as long as I can keep experimenting and have fun.  I'll keep on coming up with new strategies in normals and testing them in ranked, because that's my prerogative and the reason I continue playing.  \n\nBy the way, I came up with the aftershock {{champion:127}} last year before discussing it on the boards and subsequently watching it become meta last year.  I also played a lot of {{champion:9}} support early in the season before it became \"too meta\" so I moved on to find something new to experiment with.  It's funny how 'troll' strategies become meta.  People should recognize that the first people to experiment with anything new are usually labeled as trolls, so we trolls are actually the people generating all of the new emergent playstyles and strategies.  It is kind of ironic though that my teammates blame my 'trolling' for holding them back when I often have higher MMR with a more upward trend.  Sure, I could probably carry them harder more reliably with something meta, but I play off-meta enough that my MMR is accurate and results in fair matches when I am playing off-meta.","replies":[]}]}
