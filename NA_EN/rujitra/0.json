This comment may be long.\n\nWe have indeed done our best to handle spam reports and any other reports we get, but we are not getting paid to be here. This is a volunteer position, one in which many of us work full-time jobs outside of and try to volunteer as much as we can when we do have time. The idea that you demand instant moderation and consistent moderation 24/7 out of a bunch of unpaid volunteers who are doing their best is insanity. We have lives and other obligations. I also implore you to think about this; we have players of all ages and education levels here. While some translate posts are very obvious, there is just as much of a case saying that a user could just be... bad at English. Bit of a small point, but I felt the need to express that we aren't going to just triggerhappy ban and delete posts for not being the best grammatically.\n\nI will also like to address a comment you made in this post:\n\n> Again, use the library analogy. Virtually everyone in a public library is a volunteer. Imagine if the books you wanted weren’t shelved because they “didn’t feel like it”. What if entire sections were unorganized because “I don’t wanna walk over there”?\n>Something being volunteer doesn’t mean that those volunteers don’t have an obligation to do a job.\n\nAs a former library volunteer for 3 years, this is... rather inaccurate. I think I can count the time on one hand (that number being 2) times I've been asked to do anything related to stocking books. And it was usually \"we have absolutely no work for you guys to do, so if you want to help straighten out the books on the shelf go for it.\" Everyone was paid who stocked or managed the library. The most we did that was similar to a librarian is that we were trained to accept and let people take out books on the system, and that was again if they were oddly low-staffed. 90% of my volunteer obligation was to work with other volunteers to create events that would be fun for the children who come to the library. We'd make buttons, holds arts &amp; crafts, or run the weekly teens-night where people would come in and do for-fun gaming tournaments. Nothing to do with stocking books on a strict shift. We were also told if we had to leave at any time for anything it was 100% okay, and thanked for what we were able to do.\n\nModerators try our best, but we are not infallible beings. We cannot spend 9 hours volunteering. The notion you have expressed several times that moderators should essentially treat the Boards like a job is exactly why some mods we get have severe burnout and quit. They put in so much time and effort for no monetary gain and getting flamed all day.\n\nYou're right, volunteers should do their job! But they should also be respected as they are doing free labor for several hours a day in some cases for a Boards that hate their very existence. They are also not in a physical location to volunteer, which enables larger chunks of time to do more hands-on work. These are people who volunteer between their lunch breaks, or on their one day off on and off outside of trying to relax from a full-time job they have i nsome cases.","replies":[{"poster":"rujitra","date":"2020-02-17T08:33:51.891+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"If you don’t have enough moderators, rectify that by on boarding more moderators.

You can bar a volunteer from doing anything in the future, but you can't take anything away from them really, since they aren't getting anything for their service in the first place and they are there by choice. I.e. you can't \"fire\" a volunteer because they were never hired or worth anything to you but slave labor anyways.\nA better example would be a volunteer at a charity. I could volunteer to go help with Feed My Starving Children or a food pantry and that isn't dumb by nature, it's charity which makes sense for tiny organizations and faith-based groups, but for any non-smol indie companie it is pretty stupid to expect much more than nothing, much less strict responsibilities out of people doing something just because they believe in the cause. For example, if I volunteered at a charity and they told me I had to be there at 6 every morning and lift heavy boxes for a gew hours and got mad if I was late, I would not volunteer anymore and then no one would do it. This isn't Tom Sawyer, people are not idiots anymore, doing something for someone for nothing is not a reasonable thing to ask in most cases and as such volunteers are appreciated instead of criticized bc criticized by superiors volunteers are not volunteers for much longer","replies":[{"poster":"rujitra","date":"2020-01-31T19:17:33.461+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":5,"body":"Maybe.
