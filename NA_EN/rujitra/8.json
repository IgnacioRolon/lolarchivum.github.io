What's negative to me, might not be negative to you or another player. It's extremely open and it's up to the player to decide. You can call me any name in the book and it doesn't bother me, but someone blowing my game with stupid picks or whatever irritates me to no end.\n\nYou say anything negative to me in the game and I'm probably going to report you. Not because it offended me, but because getting you in trouble is more fulfilling to me than saying something snappy back.","replies":[{"poster":"SwainLaneWinGame","date":"2017-03-21T05:56:46.770+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is faulty logic.\n\nhttps://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/negativity\n\nBeing \"negative\" is in fact a quantifiable emotion/experience, which is specific and not at all subjective.\n\nIf you say \"please don't face check that bush\" = not negative. It is a polite request. You may _interpret it_ as a negative statement, but that does not _make it negative in objective reality_.\n\nNow if you say \"i told you not to face check that bush moron\" = negative. You are being hostile, aggressive, and insulting.\n\nOther negative variations:\n\n\"great team, go and face check bushes, so stupid.\"\n\"I can't even imagine why you would think it's ok to face check that bush, are you new?\"\n\"What's wrong with you, face checking that bush like that?\"\n\nYour words carry meaning and how you say/write them (intonation/inflexion) really matter, when it comes to the context of the conversation in game.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"KORGtuners","date":"2017-03-21T03:07:06.319+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think it is toxic.

For example:\n\n> \"i'm playing passive for cs not kills\"\n> \"zyra please come bot\"\n\nThings you would want to avoid would be:\n\n> \"**Should've** gone for mid instead of baron\" when jg had <1 bar health left\n> \"I didn't come** because it was a bad baron call**\"\n\nThose are judgements of the past.
