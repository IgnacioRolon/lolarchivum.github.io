The Rioter’s response may very well provide valuable insight that would be lost if the thread is lost.\r\n\r\nThe recent case (will not reference exactly but the moderators should know, is a prime example. The Rioter’s response provided valuable insight as to how they evaluate cases of trolling/griefing that aren’t obvious enough for the automated system to evaluate. However, those responses (or at least the *verification* that they came from Riot) are lost now as the thread was allowed to be deleted.\r\n\r\nMy suggestion is that a player who deletes a thread that has a valuable Riot (or community, but this is rarer) response should have the thread undeleted, the thread should be locked, and the content of the original post (and any quotes of it) replaced with a statement stating that the OP has requested the thread be removed. This has a precedent in that when a comment is deleted, replies to it are not.\r\n\r\nIt’s not fair to the community or the boards to allow valuable insight to be removed just because someone regrets posting the prompting thread.","replies":[{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2019-02-18T13:30:59.444+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's a main problem here -- we cannot currently *stop* a thread from being deleted.

If you missed information or made an error somewhere in this thread, you can solve it without deleting it.
