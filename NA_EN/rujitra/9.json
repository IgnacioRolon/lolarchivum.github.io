To increase the amount of trading between just supports, there should be some form of neutral objective (ex: rift scuttler) implemented that only someone with a support item can access. Maybe it could tie in with the bot lane alcove.\r\n\r\nI’m envisioning something like a rift scuttler that provides some alcove vision or something? And if someone without a support item kills it, it doesn’t provide any gold or vision (but maybe gets reset for 30 seconds).\r\n\r\nThoughts?","replies":[{"poster":"Modnar Erom","date":"2019-11-26T03:32:10.371+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You certainly get 2 items faster (though 1 of those items being the support item which may not really have the stats you are looking for). 3 depends on how the game goes.  After that you are SoL.  A contestable objective is not a terrible idea, but jungle camps aren't really that (2x of each) and minion waves certainly are not that.  Why should support be the red-headed step-child?   \n\nIt is ok though, as mains leave the role auto-fill will do its work and empathy will be had.\n\nI guess they could make scuttles invisible to anyone without a support item, and that would be some income.  But that would also take income and xp away from JG which is not in the best state either....","replies":[]},{"poster":"Modnar Erom","date":"2019-11-26T03:24:10.830+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The obvious solution is for all the people who don't think supports need gold to play support ;).

In fact, it seemed to me that I was getting items faster. But since it's a big deal for many people, maybe shifting some of that gold into a contestable objective for the two supports would be a good idea.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Center of life","date":"2019-11-26T03:13:01.008+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If it were to be something like Scuttle, then the money would probably be better funneled to the adc, it's free money and possibly xp for whomever kills it, which would add on to the issue that we have with snowball, and games ending sooner.","replies":[{"poster":"rujitra","date":"2019-11-26T03:14:04.798+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, I'm trying to figure out a solution to everyone bitching their asses off about \"boo hoo my support money\" after the changes - hence why it would be hardcoded that someone without a support item cannot kill/get gold from it (maybe it goes to the support if within a certain area around or something).","replies":[]}]}]}
