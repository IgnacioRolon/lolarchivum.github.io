Since mod messages are broken, you'd have to track all your recent posts and spot the deleted one (and if there was more than one, good luck guessing which one it was). At the very least, you should be able to look in your browser history for the thread you believe contained the deleted post that prompted the punishment, and tell us what the content was. Unless you would rather not do so in the first place, which I'd understand, as it's obviously not smart to repost punishable content. However, mods tend to be more forgiving when it's reposted in the context of asking for an explanation of why it wasn't okay; that's one of the purposes of Discuss The Boards, after all.\n\nYeah, the inability to see any mod explanation for stuff like this is absolutely problematic. That Boards feature is broken.\n\nThe mods and heralds can't make changes to the actual Boards themselves because none of them are devs with authority, and this platform's software basically launched as abandonware. It was unsupported and obsolete on day one. And bringing on new mods would probably be somewhere between useless and harmful, but possibly dipping into very beneficial. More mods can only do what current mods can do, which is shadowmoderate (undertake moderation actions without affecting users knowing it's happened, until they faceplant into a suspension) or simply not moderate. I still haven't gotten a straight answer on whether the ones who'd rather go on furlough are actually stepping back or still processing the report queue and simply dismissing almost everything due to not wanting to shadowmod even though a different mod might've actioned it anyway.\n\nModeration is _broken_. **_Broken_**. I dunno if you saw my [meme about it](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/memes/sUtAlA4h-video-footage-of-riot-introducing-mods-to-boards-new-layout), but it's actually a good description of what happened. They cannot work because the boss took away their tools. It's a miracle any of them are even still here. It's a wonder any of us are still here. It's like a company that's just experienced massive \"synergy\" and almost everyone who could get things done has been laid off so the remaining employees are up a creek without a paddle and customers are like \"uhhhh hello\" and synergy survivors gotta be like \"no, we're fukt and so are you but not in the good way\" and you cross your arms while you wait and see WTF happens now.\n\nTL;DR: Moderation is broken and mods are between a rock and a hard place, and thus so are we.","replies":[{"poster":"GatekeeperTDS","date":"2020-02-17T12:08:40.821+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":3,"body":"Moderation is broken, but it's been a goddamn peaceful two weeks without rujitra crying about moderator corruption every day.
