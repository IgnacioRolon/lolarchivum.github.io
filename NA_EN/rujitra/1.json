I wrote those answers purely in response to ideas.

Additionally, having pre-written responses allows for a lot more editing time, where I can tweak and revise and soften where needed.

You can count on your fingers the number of times PB has actually served its stated, intended purpose of helping players reform.

Ideally, people will listen to nice, reasonable responses, but if they won't listen to anything else and you have to decide between \"too blunt\" and \"bland,\" go for bland. If you don't think you're getting through, just leave the thread (if you've clearly stated that you're leaving and they continue to reply, be sure to report for harassment).\n\nMy point in posting in this thread is to tell you how to avoid getting your posts removed by moderation, not to reveal the best way to convince people to stop breaking ToS. It's nearly impossible to get a punishment in LoL, anyway; if someone got one they _earned_ it. I played with someone yesterday who saw an innocent little joke in chat that they didn't like and absolutely flipped their shit. They started screaming in caps, specifically told us they were inting to teach us a lesson (26 deaths in 18 minutes), spammed ZT phrases, etc. I reported it after the game. Guess what? They're still playing. Oh, and the game before that we had someone who initiated as Akali nonstop, dying every time. I gently suggested that they could be more careful and pick better times to go in, and guess what they flipped? That's right: their shit. And then they ended 3/15 in 12 minutes. Still playing. There is no helping those people, because they don't want help, and they don't care. When someone does manage to get banned and makes a thread, just relay the relevant information and leave.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"AeroWaffle","date":"2019-11-05T22:18:16.875+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">Are the PB boards to be simply an echo chamber for people coming to complain about the rules?\n\nThe PB board is more of a revolving door.
