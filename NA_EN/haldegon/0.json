Volibear was on the other side of the wall from the lantern but he was still able to grab it somehow.  Is that suppose to happen or is it a bug?  Link for snapshot of lantern&#039;s position and Voli postion just before he took the lantern.\r\n\r\nhttp://tinypic.com/r/332ulbn/9","replies":[{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2016-06-17T02:28:28.292+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is some small range from which you can grab the lantern.
