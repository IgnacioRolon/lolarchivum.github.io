It closes in the middle of the game, regardless of what I'm doing. I don't disconnect, it just minimizes itself. Going from a tab to fullscreen on my pc is rather slow, so if I am anywhere near an enemy, there's a 99% chance I'll be dead when it opens back up, even if it's only a matter of seconds.\n2. I was using Avast antivirus when this first began, and the client closing would be accompanied by a message from Avast saying that I need to update; but even after updating, the client would still close, and the message would still pop up. I uninstalled avast and installed AVG antivirus. The problem still occurs, but there are no messages.\n3. Windows Firewall is off.\n4. I never have anything open during the game, and all items in my tray that are not required are closed. Discord or Twitch are the only things I will occasionally run at the same time as League, but the problem persists regardless of these programs being open or not.\n5. This can happen 1-2 times during a game, or 6-8 times, and it's always in random increments.\n\n\nYou can imagine how annoying this would get. I've tried browsing for the answer elsewhere but I'm either not asking the right question or nobody else is experiencing this. All help is appreciated, thank you!\n\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-03-26T02:18:02.605+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like there might still be some program running in the background which is trying to give you a pop-up message.
