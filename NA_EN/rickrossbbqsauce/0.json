I pick a champion, game starts loading, and right when i get into summoners rift and everyone has loaded in my PC shuts down, waits 3 seconds, than turns back on. By the time I reconnect to the game, it shuts down again and says \"try to play another game\" error message. and by that time  everyone has voted for rematch and i lose IP and now have 20 minute wait times to get in game.  I've checked my Temps and my GPU never gets above 75 degrees F. and my CPU hasn't been running hot. My PC is quite old though. Intel Quad core 6600, 6gb ddr2 memory. nvidia 9800gtx+ oc, windows 7. I've been playing this game for about 3 years with this machine though, and for the most part it hasn't had a problem. Any help would be greatly appreciated (:.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-09T23:53:44.355+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm...
