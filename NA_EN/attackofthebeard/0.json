I was 4/1/3 as Vi and at about 18 minutes my internet went completely down but my team was able to win because they were so far ahead and they won in 29 minutes. So I still played in over half the game and helped with the victory because I also helped secure the 3 dragons we took that game. So I don't see why I wouldn't receive any LP when I did my fair share and couldn't help the fact my internet went down for over 6 hours. DontChaseBard is the summonername I was using and it was my most recent game.","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-06-06T19:29:18.518+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We only give out rewards to players who are able to play through the entire game.  While it seems that you were able to do quite well in the early part of the game before you DC'd, your team still did the hard work of winning even though they were down a man.\n\nAt the end of the day, we don't want to encourage leaving games or AFK'ing, which means that even if your team wins, you do not get to share in the rewards.\n\nI hope this clarifies things a bit!","replies":[{"poster":"AttackOfTheBeard","date":"2016-06-06T21:19:42.643+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They were able to win also due to my efforts for the first 18 minutes of the game where I got kills and had assists while also controlling objectives. We secured at least 2 of those 3 dragons while I was still playing. The enemy team didn't get a single tower or objective in the entire game and you're saying I didn't earn any part of the reward for winning when I played more than 50% of the game and DC'ed due to my internet inexplicably going out for over 6 hours? There is a MAJOR difference in DC'ing due to internet failing for reasons not known, and just afk'ing due to anger at the game. While I understand you don't want to reward players that ACTUALLY AFK, the fact that I was doing well and my team was doing well would show that I had no reason to AFK. My absence was due to internet failure. I earned the LP reward for that win as much as anybody on my team with what I accomplished in those 18 minutes.","replies":[]}]}]}
