I used to have it in ABCD order, but one day it changed to CBDA, and I tried to move them back to their original positions, but D and A does not move up or down. I can switch the order of A and B, but if I try to bring them below D nothing happens.\n\nBy the way, I am on the old client.\nIs this a bug?\n\nEdit: It has been like this for 2 days.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-03-23T23:41:15.797+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When you're on the legacy client, you need to right click on the group you want to move and then click on Move Up/Down. It's definitely a unique issue if it won't let you move group 'A' below group 'D'. \n\nIf you can, try logging into the updated client where you can click and drag your groups to reorder them and see if the changes work there.\n\nHit me back up if that doesn't work!","replies":[{"poster":"Kini xD","date":"2017-04-16T20:55:44.216+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm on the updated client and recently made a group it's higher up alphabetically and everytime I move it up when I relog it moves back down again.
