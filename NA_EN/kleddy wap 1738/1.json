The good news is that it's a bugsplat, which gives us a good foundation of what might be causing this, like outdated drivers or corrupt game files.  I recommend going over each step of our [game crash](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes+) guide to tune  things up.\n\nYou can also download the [hextech repair tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367) and perform a reinstall in case the repair is missing the mark.  I hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
