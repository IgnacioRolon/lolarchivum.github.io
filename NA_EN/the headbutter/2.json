If one wolf sucks it will be left behind and eventually die if it cant be put into high gear. Not join another pack like this game.\n\nFirst of all, let's get this out of the way: Wolves invite outsiders to their pack. It happens. It's not ideal and it's not commonplace, but if there's a sense that the pack is understaffed for whatever reason when an outsider wanders into the territory, the will absolutely hunt with that outsider. So yes, wolves can in fact join another pack.\n\nMore pertinently, we're talking about different things. You're discussing the long term \"survival\" of carrying yourself to high ELO. I'm discussing the short term \"survival\" of winning a game in which you have a poignantly bad player on your team.","replies":[{"poster":"Hibeki","date":"2018-03-28T05:10:03.048+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Uh no, wolves are extremely territorial and RARELY tolerate one in their territory.

We've dedicated tens of millions in prosthetic limb research and development. This lends itself to an argument I made in another post where a man was offended by my allusion to wolves: The more humanity as adapted and grown, the more it has _chosen_ to support the weakest among them. We could apply all that time, money and manpower that goes into prosthetics research into... any number of fields propping up the best of mankind. Space programs. State pensions for beloved singers and actors. Infrastructure projects that allow entrepreneurs private roadways that allow them to get to and from their places of business more efficiently, leading to greater profits and greater private sector yields.\n\nBut instead, humanity spends this time and money helping people without hands, or feet, or limbs, to function better in society. Because one day, that kid without hands might go on with their prosthetic appendages to author some society-shaping treatise. Or to compose music that alters a generation's mindset. Or to be a superb firefighter who saves dozens of lives.\n\nAbandoning the weak is nonsense, and wolves recognized this ages before humans did.

What I, and I assume many others, understand under this term is that a game is slowly or rapidly losing a huge amount of its players base, so that it can´t sustain itself anymore (well that might be a strict definition, so you could cross out the \"sustain itself\" part to loosen the definition a bit). \nFor example if League loses enough players so that queue times are increasing dramatically and Riot as a company would make losses instead of profit. \n\n>Facts are facts, but by all means act offended like all these other millennials because you can't handle the truth.\n\nSorry but you didn´t gave any reliable fact. The only fact would be the number with overwatch and league watchers but that isn´t reliable in the form you gave it to us.
