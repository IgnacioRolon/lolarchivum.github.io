Yes, her bubble can go through walls to get some distances, you fight that the same way you fight invis junglers, but warding up knowing that there is a Zoe in the game and knowing she will do that.\n\nNo Xerath cannot, compare the times you have been hit by a Zoe E out of fog vs a Xerath E out of fog.\n\"to get some distance\" you mean A LOT OF distance? It's not SOME distance it's A LOT OF DISTANCE!\n\nInvis Junglers have a clear path in which they gank you, I don't think you will ward your krugs when trying to avoid the Twitch jungle as a top laner, no you will ward the tri-bush. Zoe can literally be anywhere.\n\n+ Twitch, Shaco and Kha are the only Invis junglers without a cook-up time and you know which junglers are frustrating to play against?\n\nExactly!\n\n> Fun fact, the only one of Xerath's abilities that he needs to be in champion sight to use is his stun, literally all his other skills can outrange the base champion's vision of 1200\n\nOnly skill worth mentioning in Xeraths kit to this statement is his Q since W is hard to pull of in total fog of war.\nThat Q doesn't even nearly come to the damage of Zoes Q so still... more balanced than her. You see a big ass circle when Xerath ults so you can't even take his ult as an out of fog thing.\n\n> So you are saying that all of this can be avoided by dodging the skillshot and/or foresight?\n\nTheoretically seen yes but the E comes from fog so avoiding it is a lot harder compared to Xerath E.\n\n> Except it isn't, this is a false incredibly bias comparison where you aren't even taking half of the rest of the champion's kit into consideration.\n\nThen enlighten me\n\n> Technically no he doesn't, his Q has more range then hers.\n\nXerath Q doesn't nearly do the damage of Zoe Q, so he has to use other abilities too to get the damage off that Zoe does plus he has to charge his Q up an gets self-slowed while doing so.\n\nAnd again, Zoe Q has more range coupled with R.\n\n> Xeraths combo after hitting E took around 1.5 - 2 seconds to fully finish while being in vision range for the whole duration of the combo.\n> \n> Zoes combo after hitting E took around 1.5 seconds to fully finish while being in vision range for around 0.5 seconds.\n\nHuman reaction time around 0.2 - 0.3 seconds\nQ charge up time around 0.5 - 1 second depending on the range the E traveled\nAnimation of Q is around 0.2 seconds\nAnimation of W is around 0.2 seconds\n+ 0.2 - 0.3 seconds to aim everything and react to potential dashes and what not.\n\nSo you get 1.3 - 2 seconds.\n\nAll of this crap with Zoe Q too but without the charge up time for Q and you need around 0.5 seconds of vision time for your opponent to get the damage off.\n\n> It's almost like different champions have different powers and spikes in power, also, where once again are you getting these numbers from and on what basis?\n\nIt's almost like some playstyles and mechanics just shouldn't exist.\nThat one is just based on personal experience.\n\n> Don't step on it then.\n\nGreat advice and justification for the ability and it's effect LUL\nMaybe we should create a champ that instantly executes you when you fall below 20% hp (global range)\n\"Just don't get low\" LUL\n\n> Ok, and?\n\nIt's called counterplay and having a weakness\n\n> I mean when you factor in the fact his has literally 600 more range, sounds fair.\n\nI'm sure Xerath Q has a longer range than Zoe Q + R.....\n\n> That is very false\n\nTo which statment is this referring to?\nAnways, Zoes ability to keep stuff away from her is better than Xeraths for sure.\n\n> And yet literally all of these champions have just as much of a playrate and FAR higher win rates then her.\n> \n> \n> \n> HELL, Vel koz has literally the same play rate of 6.7% with 5% more wins then her with his 51% to her 46%.\n> \n> http://www.lolking.net/champions\n\nWhy do you take these champs winrates and playrates into the discussion? What do these numbers say when it comes to counterplayability and healthyness of a champion?\n\nAbsolutely nothing.\n\n> And theirs don't?\n\nMy dude did you even read my comment? like.. seriously...\nI never said that they are any different I even said they have the SAME playstyle!\n\n> Because there are a lot of people so blinded by her one shot potential to see past then and look at her weaknesses and would rather incredibly biasly draw up perfect what if situations and then showcase the the worst case scenarios for the champions they are comparing them to.\n\nVel / Xerath / Ziggs have one shot potential too. Vel can propably do a squishies healthbar x 4 in true damage with his whole combo.\n\nBut it's healthy one shot potential. Vel has to get dangerously close to you for him to one shot you. If he fucks up then he is dead. Zoe just tp's back after ult if she misses and tries again in 6 seconds.\n\nThere are not enough weaknesses in her kit and your \"worst case scenario\" is literally Zoe hitting her E then Q into auto.\n\nVels worst case scenario is hitting his Q into WE into second W and eating a full ult to your face. \n\nWhich one of these scenarios is more likely?\n\n> Ah yes, a problem, a problem with a 46% win rate, where high elo players are saying she is shit, where she literally hasn't seen an LCS game since her last nerfs, yup, clearly a problem, obviously needs more nerfs.\n\nAgain.. did you even read my comment?\n\"At some point you just have to accept that she is a problem and she will never stop being a problem until reworked or made unviable.\"\n\nShe was MADE unviable! Just like I said, thats a way to fix the problem because there isn't a problem if nobody picks Zoe.\n\nMaking her viable again is just making her a problem again.\nShe was literally pick or ban in LCS and high elo before the nerfs.\n\n> Mind you once again, the range without going through a wall is shorter then Xerath's E, but ok\n\nThats why I said, make it overall longer. Like.. are you even reading this?\n\n> Ah yes, make it so you have time for it to be cleansed with tenacity and make her ability to land her only damaging ability even harder, good idea.\n\nExactly it's called counterplay and strengthening a weakness of her. Her weakness is if someone gets too close on her. This will make it so if someone is close then it is harder for her to get him away, just like Xerath.\n\n> It isn't like she loses the CC when she gets back, nor is the range that far, just pop her stunned butt when it returns to the focal point.\n\nKinda hard to just \"pop her stunned butt\" if you first have to go over a wall, unfortunately to a lot of champs, walls are actually that.... walls. They can't just jump over it like Talon.\n\n> Or you can get better and be less bias, also an option.\n\nYou could also stop pretending like she isn't a problem, get less bias and not just tell me to get better?\nAlso just an opinion tho.\n\nYou could also rework the W spell, take away power from her Q and put it into the new W spell that is a damage spell, rework her passive because it's literally just a stupid sheen effect to something the current W is.\n\nThere is a lot of ways to fix the problem but first you need to acknowledge that she is a problem.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Kai Guy","date":"2018-03-15T00:26:43.553+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd use this to give myself a free flash VS any champion who has CC on a projectile W travel time.

They’ll never nerf the W by taking Flash away, so you may as well get used to it. \n\nBut no, I don’t consider her having any actual CC dodging/escaping mobility the way, say, an Ezreal does.","replies":[{"poster":"SmashinBob","date":"2018-03-15T03:10:15.557+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I never implied on her ult giving her mobility. And comparing her to Ezreal who cant really oneshot with his Q or chain CC is not even comparable\n\nShe has extremely good mobility compared to any other long range poke mage.\n\nLux, Velkoz, Xerath etc, can inherently oneshot squishies if they land their combo, their lack of mobility and long Cooldowns is what gives them weakness to play around.\nZoe one the other hand can oneshot, has inherent mobility with extremely low CDs. If they dont nerf her to  the ground she will be OP.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"MohawkBird","date":"2018-03-15T04:00:03.993+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"SmashinBob","date":"2018-03-15T04:07:25.416+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well tbh, long range mages like Lux, Xerath, Velkoz can oneshot squishies when they hit their full combo.
