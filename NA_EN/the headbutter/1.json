YOU'RE THE ONE WHO GETS BANNED.\" Not only is the game extremely shit right now, but I am at the point where just the offended people and this report culture that Riot has created in this game makes me not want to be around these type of kids.

They **want** you to try to fight them in lane.  Your best bet was to wait for them to slip up or a gank... and it looks like your Karma knew that.\n\nI do agree that your Karma took it... poorly.

Right after the shield you immediately berated karma to shield you. You got caught with your pants down with your mistaken indignation. You even made a post demanding someone to \"look again\", complaining that the karma was level two and didn't shield you.

This game is about improving your skills, improving your teamwork, improving your attitude and communication with your team.\n\nIf you can't do any of those things in those areas, then you're never going to improve in general in this game. Also, you need to improve your attitude before improving your skills, or you're not going to have an account to improve on anything.\n\nAs for the Karma, in her defense, she was at level 1. She got her Q first. She did then get her Shield and** she did shield** you as soon as she got it before you demanded her to shield you. But it really doesn't seem like Karma is the problem here. You seem like a very toxic individual.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"The Headbutter","date":"2018-04-05T04:43:31.579+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":9,"body":"It's hilarious how all these fanboys pop out in the Player Behavior section of the boards.
