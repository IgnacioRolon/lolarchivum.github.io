There is also another E bug which I think most zac mains have been aware of for awhile. Occasionally his E will start charging in the opposite direction of your cursor. When this first happened to me I thought that I must have hit the map or something, but it happened again so I looked it up and lots of people have had the same issue. I've met people in-game as well that have had this issue. I can't personally record it because my computer barely runs league of legends as it is, my frames would drop too much with recording software but you can see it at about 2:01 in this darkk mane video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9aiUJmi6BU\n\nWhile this doesn't happen very often, it's EXTREMELY frustrating when you're about to help bot lane and then your E goes in the wrong direction so you have to cancel it and since it's now on cool down you have to walk into the fight then your team flames at you for not helping...","replies":[{"poster":"Mister Two","date":"2016-01-22T08:14:20.301+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"OMG I always thought: wth, did i just missclick or somewhere in the minimap? and it's awful because i missed so many opportunities to jump in while charing in the opposite site. then u have to cancel. then u have half cooldown on it... and the tf already is over or the enemy Team is Aware that u're here. or the tf Begins because they think u jump over but instead, u won't jump and your Team is dying and they're flaming u like: why didn't u jump in?\nat first, i thought it's because i missclicked or something like that... but it happened now a few time... i don't know if i am the one who Failed, or it's really buged.","replies":[]},{"poster":"EUW Dogs","date":"2016-01-17T00:20:10.659+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So, it wasn't me?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Squidblimp","date":"2016-01-16T00:10:30.773+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Any chance this could be fixed this patch or no?
