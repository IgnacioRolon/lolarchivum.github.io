I&#039;ve donea small bit  foley work before as my job is within the production field. But this video really makes me wonder how people get into this section of sound design, do people who do SFX have background experience in music or did they just learn how to make specific sounds through experience?\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have any ideas/places where I could learn more about sound design in general?","replies":[{"poster":"Riot TreblMuffin","date":"2017-11-15T17:19:42.137+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Shaune!\n\nThe Riot Audio Team comes from a lot of different backgrounds. Some of us went to school for music, some for sound design, some for production; all over really. In my own experience, I was in radio with a heavy emphasis on music production. That led me to try my hand at film music composition; but after being on a few dub stages I really fell in love with film mixing.\n\nI've been taught by some really incredible people on that front, and our whole team still looks at a career as a learning experience. You're always the padawan, man! It's going to sound completely underwhelming but one of the most important things you can do to learn a craft, especially one like foley, is to just **be around** to see it happen. Find a post production facility, watch how people act, listen to the words they use to describe things, just absorb things.\n\nEven within sound, foley artists are a different breed. They truly are artists; they make connections in sound that you'd never imagine. Utora did some cool foley for Tahm Kench where when he told me about the objects he was recording I thought \"psh, that's gonna be hard to make that work,\" and boom he nails it. When we were working on the CG for Xayah and Rakan I remember sitting in the control room listening to extremely talented artists work, and you could literally hear the expression they could put in the most mundane objects.\n\nThere's no straight path that I know of in sound :) So just stay curious, always be a student, and pay attention!","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Sound Bear","date":"2017-11-15T18:20:23.656+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Shaune!
