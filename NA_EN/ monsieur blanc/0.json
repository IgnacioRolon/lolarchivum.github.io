It could have been made by Ornn, but it's not going to be something that was intended for Braum or specifically given to him. They wouldn't undo his lore without good reason.\n\nAdditionally, you're dismissing the presence of mountains every time people point them out, even specifically a Rioter. That makes your claims look more like grasping at straws rather than reasonable or open minded assertions.\n\nOn top of that you're asking to design a champion or to get some RP... to which I've got to say, \"get in line.\" There are a lot of people who want this, some of whom even design very cool champion concepts in Concepts & Creations.\n\nIf you want these things you've got to put the same work into it that everyone else does. And probably apply for a job at Riot. If you show the dedication and passion for champion design then you might qualify!\n\nFollow your dreams, but don't do it half-assed.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"WiccanBKaplan","date":"2017-08-07T18:24:45.455+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think I'll let you sit at 45 subs... no point in ruining such a good number when you have like 6 videos...","replies":[{"poster":" Monsieur Blanc","date":"2017-08-07T18:28:35.029+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"i want more tho i need more subs to make better videos","replies":[{"poster":"WiccanBKaplan","date":"2017-08-25T07:01:14.398+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe make some educated guess and don't just throw shit out there that isn't correct.
