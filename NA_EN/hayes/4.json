Provide that and we can talk :) K ?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Magical Player","date":"2017-02-20T22:38:25.837+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"on average takes 3 months to begin receiving rewards again.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Timethief49","date":"2017-02-20T22:27:12.284+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"loot is for positiv players and it can take a long time for you to redeem yourself as a positiv member of the community. stay positiv and you will get loot again at some point","replies":[]}]}
