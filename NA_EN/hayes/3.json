We cant reach in the monitor an MAKE them play correctly. Why should we lose the same amount of IP?\r\n\r\na tier system would be SOOOO much fairer. Right now you gain about 13 pts for a win and lose 21 when you lose....so if you have back to back games with idiots.....your down to NEG 41pts \r\n\r\nI propose this, and im putting it in general because this is the only forum people actually freaking read!\r\n\r\nYou lose or gain IP based on your performance.\r\n\r\nExample\r\n\r\nWin with A or S  +21\r\nWin with  B or C +15\r\nWin with D or F +10\r\nLose with A or S - 10\r\nLose with B or C -15\r\nLose with D or F  -21\r\n\r\nright now there 0 incentive for people to give a shit once their team starts feeding or losing badly. If a person is playing well, they should NOT be punished as harshly as your 15 death  0 kills top Zyra.","replies":[]}
