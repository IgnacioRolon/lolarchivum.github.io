I can definitely see why the moderator comments in question were ones you felt were attacking you, and I'll have a word about how we can better phrase things to avoid that, as, in-context, it seems pretty apparent that one is an analysis of your behavior from chat logs (which is what was PB is for), and while the other can be read to imply that you're not a good player I think the intent was simply that any player who is actually higher than Bronze in skill (you or someone else) will see their MMR rise reliably if they end up in low Bronze. Definitely room for improvement in communication there though, and I'll make sure that gets through.\n\nNow that that's brought up though -- nothing in that response justifies creating an entire thread just to gameplay-shame someone else. That's a very clear violation of several board rules, and not one we're going to allow.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-05-28T20:25:42.981+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Removed my post flaming a mod over semantic crap. how is this fair?\n\nConsider looking at the rules.\n\nAnd no, banning anyone who calls you out is not 'fair', it is just you being a brat.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Malfectious","date":"2018-05-28T20:30:08.384+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You seem to not understand how being in charge works....","replies":[{"poster":"Hayes","date":"2018-05-28T20:32:02.901+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Malfectious,realm=NA,application-id=6heBIhQc,discussion-id=MzoMmvO2,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2018-05-28T20:30:08.384+0000)\n>\n> You seem to not understand how being in charge works....\n\nIngsoc is real folks..","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Hayes","date":"2018-05-28T20:27:46.922+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"i dont think you get the point  they were harassing ME, so i showed him he was WRONG that he was actually the lesser player, but yet MY post gets removed.\n\nIts a case of well, we ignore it because he works for us.
