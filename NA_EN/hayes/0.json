I'm following so far.\n\n> It matters not what you say, but that enough people report you, which is bullshit.\n\nThis is flat out wrong. Number of reports doesn't increase or decrease the likelihood of a punishment. And any reports beyond the first don't do anything, because the system only decides to review the match when there is _one_ or more reports. After that punishment is entirely based on behavior in-game, and if no behavior is found it simply throws out the false reports and leaves you alone.\n\n> Im not toxic for no reason, i don&amp;#039;t start off just being mad , what about being able to report people for ruining my game experience by feeding every single game?\n> \n> Why does it take so much longer for them to get banned then it takes me.\n\nhttps://memegenerator.net/img/instances/500x/56331368/but-teacher-he-started-it.jpg\n\n> Teemo support steals buffs, travels around to different lanes then jungles while were trying to play , nothing.\n> \n> Bottom lane feeds 10 deaths in 10 mins, goes 2/25 combined, nothing.\n> \n> But i get &amp;quot;toxic&amp;quot; for pointing out how they are screwing not only me but 3-4 other people.\n> &amp;quot;\n> Used to be you could report people for &amp;quot;Unskilled play&amp;quot;\n> \n> We need to do this again, because there are way to many people who just get on to troll on purpose and cost people their matches.\n> \n> Im not perfect, i have bad games but its never anything like these people.\n\nDude none of that matters. If Riot gives people a free pass to flame when they feel like they've been wronged then we'd never see any flaming punished, because 9 times out of 10 the person flaming feels justified in doing it, regardless of whether they are actually right or not.\n\nI completely understand being frustrated by these players, but flaming them and calling attention to them in chat is like feeding pigeons. The more you do it the more they will come and do the same shit over and over again. And if for some reason a person is not trolling but you have perceived them to be trolling then you flaming them will just make them miserable for no good reason, when they are actually innocent of the 'crime' you intended to punish them for.\n\nIt's not our place or right to punish players in-game for trolling, leave that to Riot.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hayes","date":"2018-04-05T19:31:16.162+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":11,"body":"i would also like to add that those people down voting me, are also probably the assholes that do things like I listed above. \n\nBut of course the way of the world, if it doesn't affect me, I don't care , right?","replies":[{"poster":"Prandine","date":"2018-04-05T19:42:51.350+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Hayes,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=B9AtPLNg,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2018-04-05T19:31:16.162+0000)\n>\n> i would also like to add that those people down voting me, are also probably the assholes that do things like I listed above. \n> \n> But of course the way of the world, if it doesn&#x27;t affect me, I don&#x27;t care , right?\n\nOr, and bare with me here, maybe it's because we've heard this same old tired argument from many many players that has been debunked many many times. HalcyonDweller already explained it pretty well, so I'll just say that people disagreeing with you does not necessarily mean they're toxic, and if this is the kind of attitude you're going to have on the boards then what does that say about your attitude within the game itself?","replies":[{"poster":"Hayes","date":"2018-04-05T19:47:50.466+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"in game im usually good until shit starts being wrong .

Also, people ignoring your advice could be for a number of reasons, including but not limited to the following: \n\n1) They just don't want to listen to anyone period.\n2) Your so-called \"advice\" is actually given in the form of insults, name-calling and/or general harassment.\n3) They feel that their current strategy/build is more effective than your suggestion.\n\nIn all but the 3rd one, and especially the second one, no matter what you say is gonna change their mind, so there's no point in continuously badgering them about it. The third one may change their mind if they feel it necessary, but it helps if you're mature and respectful about it and don't devolve into flaming them if they don't.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Arammus","date":"2018-04-05T20:32:04.932+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"you get downvotes because you literally have no clue what you are talking about\nthe \"unskilled player\" report was removed because it (almost) did nothing. noone ever got punished for it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2018-04-05T19:26:45.554+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did you know, the unskilled player option was there for Riot to adjust their MMR match making when it first came out?
