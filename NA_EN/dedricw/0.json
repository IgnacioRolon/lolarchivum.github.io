My team was pretty bad and we ended up forefeighting the match. Since I was in a rush I hit escape and left right after our Nexus was destroyed. I leave a few seconds before the defeat screen popped up and now I'm penalized for 5 ques. I have to wait 20 minutes per que. Fix this stupid shit. I shouldn't have to wait 20 minutes before a game for 5 games just because I left a few seconds before that over dramatic ass defeat screen pops up. Like I get it we LOST can I just go? \"LeaveBuster\" more like WasteMyDamnTime","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-31T23:46:50.085+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You'll actually never get a 5-game low-priority queue for leaving a single match because we understand that sometimes emergencies come up. In this case, it seems a trend of disconnecting or going AFK during matches has caused this penalty to be added to your account. \n\nIf you're experiencing any technical issues that are causing you to disconnect from games, please let me know so we can work together to resolve it. Let me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]}]}
