Has anyone else encountered this? Also, anyone have an idea of why the client code would register my account as being banned/under leveled for being left open too long?","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-09-18T23:03:46.452+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It could be a network or protocol related bug, especially if your computer entered sleep mode or disabled the network adapter.\n\nSoftware will often show incorrect error messages if it gets a condition it cant understand/is unprepared for, either a default message of a \"none of the others match, lets just use this one\", which is a logical flaw in the programming.","replies":[]}]}
