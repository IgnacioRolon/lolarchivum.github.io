Some of those previous issues I've been told are still being looked into, but I know some players have also been having fps issues from the fancy Snowdown assets being used lately. \n\nI know it might seem like we're not paying much attention or doing much at the moment, but please do me a favor and double check your drivers first, then try a repair to make sure the files are working properly, and then check off the other steps in the [**FPS guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting). It may not fix everything, but doing these steps can help our techs narrow down what the problem *isn't* which can help them find the main source of the problem. \n\nAfter trying these steps, hit them up in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) with your game/network logs so they can walk you through some more in-depth troubleshooting and gather data about these fps issues.","replies":[{"poster":"zark1989","date":"2017-12-21T01:07:20.864+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Broporo,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=AoqBHh98,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-12-20T23:32:16.532+0000)\n>\n>  please do me a favor and double check your drivers first, then try a repair to make sure the files are working properly, and then check off the other steps in the [**FPS guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting).

I even went as far as to completely wipe my hard drive. Everything. Like, it is a brand new computer now. The first program I downloaded, and ran was League and it still ran at about 40 FPS dropping to 20 at its worst. I've already posted the specs of my computer and I'm above the minimum requirements by quite a margin. \n\nWe are simply asking for an update as paying (because lets be real, who hasn't paid for at LEAST one skin) customers and avid gamers. And we haven't received that. Not even a, \"Hey we found this common denominator, doing this will help us further trouble shoot.\"\n\nI think with an issue as wide spread as this, we should definitely be kept in the loop. \n\n:D","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-21T02:28:28.136+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The devs definitely do their best to deliver updates when they know for sure what's going on, and at this point, it seems like it just hasn't been figured out yet is all. When we poros ask to check off certain steps, that's just the usual troubleshooting process. It'd be rather silly to assume you've done everything only to find out step 1 or 2 of the usual process would have fixed everything, assumptions are bad in general (I think we know the phrase here xD) \n\nThis is also why we sometimes stress the need to reach out to our techs in a ticket. We poros don't have all the tech knowledge they do about fps issues, and if you never contact them you're doing yourself a disservice! Even if they don't immediately wave a magic tech wand and fix everything, working through some steps with you can be incredibly helpful to finally getting to the bottom of things.","replies":[{"poster":"Dªy","date":"2017-12-21T04:19:16.173+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Really appreciate the response and thankyou for highlighting some things that might help fix the issues with some users.\nPersonally I have tried each of these steps but no luck so far.\n\nI fully support the idea of submitting a ticket and hope that it does get fixed soon.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
