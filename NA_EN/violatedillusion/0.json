I've created some good reasons for this and will list them below.\r\n\r\n1. Coming into season 8 and it appears that the game is still very much unbalanced and I will even go as far to say that it has become even more unbalanced. Some champs are just so much easier than others and the easiest champs are more prone to gaining a win because sadly higher skill champ are just overall harder to use and require more attention and skill shots that can't always hit.\r\n\r\n2. Riot simply does not listen to their customers in a way that promotes action on their part. An example would be the old map skins for the holidays; I remember for YEARS everyone kept telling and asking them to bring them back after they got rid of them but riot simply pushed it aside and claimed that they didn't have the resources. Unfortunately riot failed to realize that resources should always be used on what the customer wants, not what riot wants. \r\n\r\n3. The fact that a 10 second cooldown of a basic skill of one champ can completely cancel out a 90 second cooldown ultimate of another champ (ENOUGH SAID). \r\n\r\n4. The fact that riot is trying to make the game far more easier promotes a feeling of boredom and makes winning seem like childs play. Winning has started to become so easy I actually feel bad for the other teams sometimes and feel as if I don't even deserve to win.\r\n\r\n5. Removing runes and masteries and adding..... whatever it is that they added. It was a sad day indeed when I found out about this. The game went from having hundreds and thousands of different combination rune and mastery tactics to having so few and I just want to say that even the new addition of these runesteries still seem unbalanced and some are even annoying. Games are so much more enjoyable when you have more options and have the opportunity to find what works best for your favorite champs, now its boring, almost like an RPG that automatically chooses your skills for you.\r\n\r\nI've stopped paying for anything rito has to offer me. I know that this game still makes tons of money because, well sadly people are run by their emotions and we live in a consumer world where everyone throws their money down the toilet on things that you can't even physically hold. You can't really blame them because they were conditioned that way since birth. \r\n\r\nLeague of Rito is peaking and will soon be on the decline, it's not a matter of if, but when. Because history always repeats itself I can personally guarantee the end of riot and the start of something else, in time. All we can hope is that the next game is better and more rounded than the last, but again, sadly history has a way of repeating itself. \r\n\r\nI welcome your feedback and encourage it.\r\n\r\nGo away Trolls, no one likes you anyway.","replies":[]}
