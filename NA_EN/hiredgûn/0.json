I don't know why you people at Rito games thought it was a good idea to make it so you can sometimes not get items off of carousel but that is the worst decision you guys could have possibly made for the game mode that I have come to really enjoy. Someone told me you were trying to make the games longer by doing so but it literally only does the opposite. It speeds up the pace of the games because anyone that is behind gets royally screwed since they cant get first pick on the items in carousel rounds, which is like half the game tbh. And the fact that you can get a unit with no items in first carousel round is even more ridiculous. This change, along with Hextech being as strong as it is, also completely screws over some comps in the game(like gunslingers) which kinda need items to be even somewhat strong. I can genuinely say that if this terrible change makes it to live servers, and Hextech 4 doesn't get a nerf, I will not be playing TFT anymore. it will be another failed game mode by your company. Extremely questionable decision making Rito games, although I guess not completely shocking considering your track record.

By putting players on equal skill level against each other they can better see how the mode works, how much is it influenced by RNG etc. so they can make better balance changes, decisions how to evolve TFT and new synergies etc.? It is far better to see how the game actually works than having someone with understanding of the TFT crush clueless players who just blame it all on RNG and ,,luck\". It also gives incentive to players to play the mode more so they get more data.","replies":[{"poster":"A Dove Like You","date":"2019-08-07T16:22:47.176+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Aritmor,realm=EUNE,application-id=RaE1aOE7,discussion-id=FzOm68MZ,comment-id=00000000000000000000,timestamp=2019-08-07T13:59:14.953+0000)\n>\n> Did it ever cross your mind that it might be better for testing and gathering statistics about the mod?

They just come here to cry and complain about stuff.
