However, if you look close at his feathers behind him, you can see that at a certain point, the black lines on them just dont appear, and you are able to see Azir&#039;s (what I assume to be) hitbox. Again, this doesn&#039;t affect gameplay, but I noticed it and thought it ought to be said.\n\nAs far as I know, this glitch occurs in all versions of the game, but I couldn&#039;t be 100% sure. To recreate the bug, just select Azir&#039;s galactic skin and play and you should be able to see it. Though I couldn&#039;t get a good screenshot of his feathers and his weapon doing it at the same time, you can also see it there. To reiterate, I&#039;m not sure if this happens for anyone else.\n\n(Btw I tried just posting the screenshot here normally but for the life of me I can't figure out how.)","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2017-10-09T21:46:23.976+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Nyloaf! \n\nThis is an unfortunate side effect of character inking, which is an unforgiving feature. The only way to avoid this would be to turn character inking off. \n\n{{sticker:sg-janna}}","replies":[{"poster":"Nyloaf","date":"2017-10-13T15:22:08.438+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh ok!
