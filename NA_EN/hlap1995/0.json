If you would happen to still have the logs from this session, that would help us in tracking down the issue :)\n\nIf you can, could you submit a support ticket via support.riotgames.com and attach the logs to it? If you're comfortable uploading the logs to Drive or Dropbox and sharing a link here, that would work as well.\n\n[This article](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/208796286-Alpha-Client-becomes-unresponsive) has a few instruction on how to grab the logs. Feel free to zip up your entire LeagueClient Logs folder if you're not sure which log file it is, or if you've played a few games after you had this issue.\n\nThanks!\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[]}]}
