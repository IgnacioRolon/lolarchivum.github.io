Maybe 1-3 if you can bait/shield properly. If youre low elo, its usually pretty easy to bait a Darius into wasting his pull without having to use your E. If you can do that, you have a window where you can dive into him for some quick damage and get out before he can pull again. Darius is a lot more naturally tanky than Riven though if I remember right, so if you cant get ahead early youll be in a bad way. Your best bet is to just ask for ganks and avoid as much of his damage as possible. \n\nIf he does pull you in though, you need to just dump all your damage into him quickly and get out. Something like E > W > QQQ or something along those lines.\n\nRunes and masteries should just be your normal setup, I see no need to change them just for Darius. AD marks/quints, armor or health seals and cdr or mr glyphs.","replies":[]}]}
