This at least adds options when it comes to late game builds, each of those items have their benefits that the elixir may not be able to provide. It seemed like a neat idea so I figured I would share it!\r\n {{item:2138}} {{item:2139}} {{item:2140}}","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-06-05T02:56:37.888+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"GW is meant to be a choice, not something everyone can just get whenever they want.
