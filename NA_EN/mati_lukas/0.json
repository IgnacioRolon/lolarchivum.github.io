I really feel like i shouldnt have been banned because of some unexpected ''toxicity'' coming out of me when getting really tilted after a trolling game. Everyone has his bad days and it happend to me.A lot of stuff irl happend to me back then so i was really sad and kind of depressed. This appeal means a lot to me because i can express my feeling, for example i feel like right now i threw so much time and effort for no reason. I spent more than one thousand hours playing this game because i found something in it and it became my passion. After all having 1 bad day could result in a perma ban for ''flame/toxicity'' eventhough calling names such as r%%%%% or stupid i really feel like its in our everyday life and no one really gets affended.U know gow much experience i have playing this game? From being called names about my nationality to being told that my mom is a whore/stripper or whatever or even encountering people hoping death to me, family members, and guess what that didnt result them in a ban. How can typing such things not result into a ban but a bad day for me and say 1 or 2 bad words could have as a result a perm ban on my account.I am still a kid as i am 16 but when i got banned i havent thought as much about my actions and about what i say sometimes.I really really REALLY hope that you consider this appeal and take it to heart , because i really want to keep playing the game but actually i lost many friends because of my account ban and i cant find a lot of them, i know it hard to unban someone for u as it may seem unfair for some others, but i think that i have grown up, im more mature and i feel that i wont continue such behavior(eventhough that behavior comes rarely from me). I really want u to make it possible for me to play the game and be a happy player and all i want is that second chance with which i will surely show a lot of improvement maturity and effort coming from my side.\r\nPlease consider this appeal, all im asking is a second chance and u are the only one that could help me and make my day\r\nLots love for making the game how it is and hoping to hear from u soon,\r\nmati luaks","replies":[{"poster":"Arcade Lulu","date":"2020-01-07T19:43:43.112+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"Not gonna happen\n\nI could write a long af text explaining why it ain't gonna happen.

Cause on  the 14 day ban it clearly says if you would break the rules again you're next punishment would be perma ban. System isnt a scam its up to the player to change they behavior its not there fault if you cant change your behavior.","replies":[{"poster":"mati lukas","date":"2020-01-07T20:04:17.383+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":10,"body":"Yes man if u try to change ur behavior the community doesnt help u if u play the game everyday","replies":[{"poster":"ﬂoo","date":"2020-01-07T20:29:41.521+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=mati lukas,realm=EUNE,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=dK8N1EkN,comment-id=0000000000010000,timestamp=2020-01-07T20:04:17.383+0000)\n>\n> Yes man if u try to change ur behavior the community doesnt help u if u play the game everyday\n\nBecause it's not the community's job to help you fix your problems?\n\nPeople come to play this game for competitive reasons or to enjoy playing the game, mostly the first one these days. So someone else venting their problems or anger issues in chat is ruining games to everyone else. And no, just because you \"replied\" or \"defended\" yourself to someone else, that doesn't make a difference.\n\nIf you are being notified that you have to change your behaviour to not get banned, you shouldn't ignore that advice, or you'll end up in your situation.\n\nBtw, those people who act the same or worse ways in your games are gonna be in the same situation as you at some point, either they'll have to change their attitude or they'll be perma'd just alike. So don't fall down to their level and don't engage them or let them provoke you if you want to better yourself.","replies":[{"poster":"mati lukas","date":"2020-01-07T20:41:03.526+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":8,"body":"i can totally undrestand what u are trying to say but i really want to get unbanned bcs i feel like ive made my mistakes, i know what i did wrong and i can become better and prove it to you","replies":[{"poster":"rujitra","date":"2020-01-07T21:32:58.110+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your chance to do that was before the permanent ban.

A lot of people get offended, trust me.\n\n\n>U know gow much experience i have playing this game?

Just like you, people want to play League and have fun, not endure harassment or negativity. Just like you, they probably had a bad day too, and you made it worse for them.\n\nIt's really unfortunate, but you have to strive to be a better person and treat others with respect, even if you're not treating you with the same respect. Ignore them, mute them, report and let the system do its thing. Contribute to a positive environment, don't add fuel to the fire of negativity!","replies":[]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2020-01-07T20:56:35.163+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You were permabanned for breaking the rules multiple times and ignoring multiple punishments, you acknowledge that this happened, and yet you _still_ believe that the corresponding consequence shouldn't apply to you? Why? You've obviously learned nothing from your punishments, which is what made Riot realize that you are incapable of reform and they'll never let you play the game again. You had not only a second chance but a third chance and a fourth chance, and now you think you deserve _another_ one? And you still blame other players for _your_ actions. Why should they get punished for breaking the rules but you shouldn't? It doesn't sound like you've matured at all. Maybe in another five or ten years you'll understand your ban and agree with the punishment.
