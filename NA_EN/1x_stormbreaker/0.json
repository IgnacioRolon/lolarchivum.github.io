I know I'm rooting for 100T, but I don't really know any of the non-NA teams. I only started playing in March and I'm only really rooting for 100T because of Aphromoo and C9 because of Sneaky. If I could get some advice on the match ups that'd be pretty cool. Maybe I'll just go with your picks because I don't really know any better.

TL, KT and EDG split there games. TL and KT sweep MAD, but EDG splits with them. \n\nTL goes 5-2 *wins tie breaker*\nKT goes 4-3\nEDG goes 3-3\nMAD goes 1-5\n\nKT is a monster team, but I really think TL have 1st locked up.

Pobelter is finally playing like a Top Tier Mid laner.  Doublelift having the best Season he has ever had with imo his best support to hit the Rift with. Yeh there was Aphromoo that is one of the best supports in the game, but Olleh is better suited for Doublelift.  This team is the best team to ever play on the worlds stage out of North America. Finally, we all know xMithie will show up and perform. He is always consistent regardless, but looked so good during Finals. Everyone is stepping up.\n\nThis group is going to be fun to watch. Can't wait for Day 1.
