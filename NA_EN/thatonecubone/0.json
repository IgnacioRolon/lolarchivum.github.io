Yeah, that game is over in solo q. I've watched a Yi literally dive people under turret no problem and barely even take a scratch of damage. He's basically impossible to outrun once he is fed... so he just runs all over the place picking off people until the team surrenders. Something just needs to be done about these snowball champs that can fight through the entire team without a care.

If you want a real counter to the fish, try playing Kassadin. Start with flask. Use your Q on him always when you can (if he E's to avoid it, he will OOm fast early on in the game). You can win every single trade where you have your Q and W up, and post- 6 you roam faster, can tank his burst (passive+ Q shield), can avoid his E damage and ultimates with R and you scale at least as hard as he does.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2014-11-14T22:00:50.218+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Says fizz isnt op.\n\nCalls Akali op.\n\nWat","replies":[{"poster":"Lyrxen","date":"2014-11-14T22:51:47.752+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First time I won vs  an Akali was with fizz, so...","replies":[{"poster":"shadecrapper","date":"2014-12-30T05:56:08.860+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fizz does pretty well against her.

They are weak early, and if you let them start racking up kills they just snowball out of control.
