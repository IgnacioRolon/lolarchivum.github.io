Since the addition of sorting the champs that still have their chest available, I know for certain that I did not have a chest earned on either champ I played when someone earned an S. I thought perhaps it was because I was in a solo queue, but I would think that wouldn't be the case since people earn chests in solo queue all the time. Am I incorrect in thinking this? Also, I have 4 chests available to earn currently, so it isn't as if I have reached the limit of chests either.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-01T22:24:37.022+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"People *can* earn chests in solo q, but only if they get an S on someone they own.
