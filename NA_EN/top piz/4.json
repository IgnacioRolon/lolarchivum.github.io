It's a typical \"My conservative relatives prearranged a marriage for me without me even knowing about it\" type of romcom. The reason it's good isn't necessarily because of the originality of the plot, but rather because it's executed well. Most of the characters are cute and lovable, with a couple even being iconic.\n\nMy main problem with the show is that the male lead (the guy engaged to the heroine) is EXTREMELY boring. He rarely says or does anything. I feel like the show could've been better if he was given a bit stronger of a personality. This isn't to say the show is bad, though. I definitely enjoyed it.","replies":[{"poster":"LichKing234","date":"2016-05-24T20:40:38.989+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Top PIz,realm=NA,application-id=Ir7ZrJjF,discussion-id=6xQhoY3X,comment-id=00000000000000000000,timestamp=2016-05-24T18:26:16.533+0000)\n>\n> The above post is an accurate description.
