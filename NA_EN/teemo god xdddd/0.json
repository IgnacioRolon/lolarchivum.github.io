But how do you prove it unless the person is dumb enough to say it in chat? And even if they say it, how do you prove they meant it and didn't just say it and start trying again a minute later?\n\nFrankly, Riot doesn't even punish actual *intentional feeding* and intentionally abandoning the game. If they can't address that, there's no hope for softer behaviors like \"not trying your hardest to win.\" You just have to hope these people will sink lower in rank over time.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AronCartman","date":"2019-11-30T06:43:35.726+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":4,"body":"Its allowed because no bad words were said, and having 40 bad games in a row with smite cleanse nunu purchasing only boots is clearly a coincidence.
