His kit, as mentioned by others, is unusual. Playing him a couple games (and definitely not enough to feel comfortable with him), the switching between ranged & melee was a little off putting. If I wasn't paying attention I'd AA after a Q and end up leaping into a fight I didn't mean to join, or I'd be trying to catch up to someone and couldn't figure out why I wasn't jumping to them for a second. I understand how the abilities work, but you have to develop the muscle memory for it for it to set in.\n\nHis brush thing is odd, and its very circumstantial. Playing it at the right time and place will make a big difference for his effectiveness. I see them just thrown down in the lane for no reason and if you get zoned out of them it can backfire. The brush also means that he'll usually be stronger in specific circumstances. Teams that can use the brush for best effect will get more out of it, and some comps will be better equipped for this then others.\n\nBard isn't built for every lane. Put him with an ADC that needs babysitting and he'll be hard pressed to be able to roam, collect shrines or assist other lanes. But put him with an ADC that can stand on their own for a minute and he can be much more effective. Some Champs are niche. I think Ivern will be niche.","replies":[]},{"poster":"EMU Analyst","date":"2016-11-06T09:27:22.102+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dude, ivern is an amazing champion it's just alot of players assume they can just pick him up and get a pentakill.
