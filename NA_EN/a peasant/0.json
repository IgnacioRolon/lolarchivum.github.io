Most often, though, we select players who are very active, are a positive influence on the community and would provide very good feedback. Sometimes what we're looking to test will also prompt a batch of invites to specific players who could provide great insight on that feature or change. For example, if we were looking to rework Taric, we could find some of the most active Taric mains and send them an invite.\n\nFull details are outlined in our [PBE FAQ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751904-Public-Beta-Environment-FAQ#top).
