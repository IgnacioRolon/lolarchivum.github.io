Their list of supported modems are limited. I ended up buying the C3000|N300 WiFi Cable Modem Router. The internet is much faster than the previous. Mostly everything is great, and if I never played online games, I wouldn't have noticed anything wrong, but unfortunately, I am experiencing packet loss while gaming. For example, in League of Legends, the game will be running fine, except for a little choppiness? As in, I feel like it takes a minute for my commands to register, then eventually, my character will freeze and I'm not able to use any abilities. Everything else around me is perfectly fine, and other players seem unaffected. My ping is always constant and never escalates, my fps is great. I'm not using wireless either. I opened my command prompt and pinged -t 8.8.8. while playing and ended up with 1% packet loss. I don't want to contact my ISP yet and have them send out a tech after they literally just set up my internet a week ago, so I'm hoping someone will be able to help me here. I would like to note that even on my previous internet, which is much worse, with a crappy modem/router, I did not have packet loss. My current modem doesn't support QoS or NAT restrictions, or anything of the sort.","replies":[{"poster":"Kokua","date":"2017-07-25T03:06:17.210+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"When I had 20 Mbps service, all my games ran perfectly fine, smooth. No packet loss. I upgraded to 50 Mbps, and then started to get 1-8% packet loss spikes throughout my games. It doesn't affect every game I play harshly. I can play Diablo 3 and The Division seamlessly, but WoW, CS:GO and LoL all have this heavy packet loss issue that cause the game to freeze for a moment, which is just long enough to die. I've contacted my provider several times, and they sent maintenance (both inside the house and out on the lines) 5 times, and they are clueless to what the problem is. Also, they are pretty hopeless about responding about the issue, which is why we've had to contact them so many times. \"We'll monitor your line for a week and see if we can figure out the issue, and contact you\" - over a month later, no reply. Same provider that gave me 20 previously. On the up side, my downloads and video streaming is faster, on the downside, my online games are suffering.","replies":[{"poster":"Zachaariah","date":"2017-07-25T03:30:50.818+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's exactly the problem I am having except I just haven't contacted my ISP because I feel like that will be the issue; they won't be able to figure out the issue and I'll just be wasting my time. I actually still have the other ISP, but my family uses it, so I can only play when they aren't here, but the whole point of upgrading my internet was to have it for myself, and be able to stream. I can't do that with my previous internet, it's not capable. One person gets on Farmville, and my ping jumps up to where I can't play. One storm cloud in the sky and I have random lag spikes.

Thus, every time they open it, they're basically downloading all the images in the game, all the animations, everything, which can be quite a lot for people who have played for a long time. Not all browser games are like this though, for example, RuneScape (when it was still available as a browser game) would save several gigs of files on your computer, probably without your knowledge. But it allowed the game to be opened faster, load faster, and not cause a strain on your internet every time you open it.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Havoc G","date":"2018-01-17T05:01:59.889+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This post is really disheartening.. I'm in the same boat with Comcast.. I used to never have problems like this. It started a few months ago and I'm working through their support to no avail yet. 2nd tech visit on Thursday. I have friends on Comcast at lower tier speeds who don't have this happening and they have 3 or 4 people ok games at a time. Any good updates on this.

Typically it happens when your ISP routes your connection in a weird way or through a damaged node. I'd suggest using our [**log reader**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743) to check for sure just how bad that packet loss is when it's coming to our servers so that I know how we should handle this.","replies":[{"poster":"Zachaariah","date":"2017-07-25T06:16:19.919+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Your average ping was 51 milliseconds, which means your ping was good overall.\"\n\n\"Your percentage of packet loss for this game was 1.25%. Overall, this means you had a high amount of packets lost during the game.\"\n\nI'm already connected via ethernet, unplugged my modem/router for 30+ seconds and plugged it back in, nothing is ever playing in the background and no one else is using the internet. I've tried forwarding the ports, as well. My modem/router doesn't support QoS either.\nThe only thing left for me to do is contact my ISP, I suppose, but I really do feel like it's pointless. I have packet loss in any game I play on PC. I haven't noticed any issues with multiplayer games on PS4 though.","replies":[{"poster":"Zachaariah","date":"2017-07-30T13:47:00.144+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Quick update.\n\nI replaced the modem because I was curious to see if that would help, which it didn't.\nPrior to replacing the modem, I called Cable One and explained my issue. The lady ran a few tests on her end and stated that she could see packet loss on their end and that something was dropping me from my modem/router 30+ times within the past 5 days. She got a tech to come out the following day who practically did nothing. He ran a few speed tests that I have ran countless times and I even explained that my connection looks great, but I am still experiencing major packet loss in games. My ping is low. I'm getting more than what I pay for with 170 mbps down, 5 up. He said, \"I don't know what to tell you, man. Your connection is great.\" Then he left. I called Cable One again, they ran their tests again, which ended up with around 2% packet loss, and declared that it wasn't serious enough to send another tech out to possibly solve the issue.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
