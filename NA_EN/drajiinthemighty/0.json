This error looks like it could be caused by a security setting with your OS that's blocking some game files from loading.  It could also involve other factors like corrupt game files too.  I suggest starting off with our [permissions](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) guide to make sure that nothing is blocking the game from being accessed.  Test it in a custom game and let me know if it works out for you!","replies":[]}]}
