I got three key fragments and forged them into one key. I had four chests before I attempted to open a chest. I clicked open and it showed no animation, and the chest disappeared off the screen so I was confused. Reloaded page and it had taken both my chest and my key, however there was no new skin or loot from it. had Astro-naut, Blood Lord Vlad and Morgana champ shard previously. I reloaded but still nothing.\r\n\r\nUnsure how I can prove this, I didn't take a pic of the error (my mistake) but is there any way you could tell i had a key and maybe refund the two? I'd greatly appreciate it.","replies":[{"poster":"Travizzt","date":"2017-02-27T02:45:52.353+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have the same issue.

However, luckily a quick message with support fixed my issue. Apparently, I had received an icon, and so as the chest glitched and didn't show me what I received, I didn't take into account that it may have been an icon. It had in fact added to my account, but seeing no physical loot confused me and the glitchy chest only confused me further.\n\nThank you!","replies":[]}]}]}
