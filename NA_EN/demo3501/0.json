I get it i really do! &quot;If your enemy is dead it wont hurt your bot companion&quot; but to be honest if you really wanted that to happen you could have just gone with any assasin as a support and that would do the trick! (At least thats what i think) because besides being squishy pyke cant heal shield or buff your ad... The first time i picked it i really felt useless towards the fact that i couldnt do anything againsnt my dying ad... And even more guilty to know that i was taking the kills and he was bare handed... \r\nMaybe i am just playing it wrong? Maybe he was better of as a regular assasin? Please help me get the essence of pyke!","replies":[]}
