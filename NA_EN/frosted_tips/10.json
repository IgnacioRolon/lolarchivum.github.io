You basically can't get the enemy out of lane. Ravenous works with only a few champions. Even Kassadin takes Fleet Footwork.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"5050BS","date":"2019-01-28T06:43:50.298+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is\n\nIts {{item:3812}} for free","replies":[{"poster":"Paroe","date":"2019-01-28T07:05:02.887+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=XXXMurderPenguin,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=wxsFYxRL,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2019-01-28T06:43:50.298+0000)\n>\n> It is\n> \n> Its {{item:3812}} for free\n\nIf you get 5 unique kills or assists sure. \nRavenous hunter is not a problem by any stretch of the imagination, and if it were, spend 800g and fix that problem. \n\nIts 1.5%+2.5%per stack... \n...

If you take Relentless Hunter on a mage like {{champion:143}} , you can literally get around the map faster than 90% of the champion arsenal. I get up to 526 Move speed out of combat/487 move speed in combat with her.

Almost half of those champions do not run Electrocute or Dark Harvest. If it was not optimal than they would get Ultimate Hunter, unless they didn't have a real ultimate like Nidalee/Jayce.\n\n> 3) They choose it because it's supplemental to their already existing heal options.

But I would not know for everyone, but from my experience it heals for a high percentage.\n\nYour last point about them dying more often does not mean anything and also yeah supports like MS so it would make sense to run Relentless on Zyra.","replies":[{"poster":"Illabethe","date":"2019-01-28T17:47:04.057+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"2) 31 out of? 178?

I can support her, but she's better in other roles. Stop trying to segregate champs by role.\n\nAlso, dying more is extremely significant. It means the healing isn't doing its job, and that the other team is earning more gold off of you. It means you move slower, lose more waves, and reach fewer fights. You take less objectives.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
