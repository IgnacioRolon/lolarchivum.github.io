For each elemental drake Shyvana or her allies defeat, she gains an extra 5 armor and magic resist.~~\n\n_(New)_ **Slayer: Whenever Shyvana is involved with the slaying of a dragon she may upgrade one of her basic abilities.**\n\n**Q: Targets damaged by Twin Bite are stunned for 0.25 seconds**\n\n**W: Burnout leaves a burning trail behind Shyvana damaging all enemies that walk through it. Trail lasts 3 seconds and deals (30-200)+(20% AP)(Lv. 1 to Lv. 18)**\n\n**E: Any targets affected by Flame Breath have the Armor and magic Resist shredded by 15%**\n\nQ: Twin Bite - Shyvana strikes twice on her next attack. The second attack will deal 20 / 35 / 50 / 65 / 80%--&gt;40/55/70/85/100% of her attack damage as physical damage. Both attacks will trigger on-hit effects.\nShyvana&#039;s autoattacks against non-structures reduce the cooldown of Twin Bite by 0.5 seconds.\nDragon Form: Shyvana cleaves all units in front of her on her next attack. Each unit hit will be dealt on-hit effect and grant Fury twice.\n\n_(New)_ **Shyvana gains 25 attack ranged while Twin Bite is active.**\n\nCooldown - 9/8/7/6/5\n\n**W: Burnout** - During the next 3 seconds, Shyvana deals 20 / 33 / 45 / 58 / 70 (+0.2 per bonus attack damage) magic damage each second to nearby enemies and gains 30 / 35 / 40 / 45 / 50% increased movement speed. ~~Shyvana&#039;s auto attacks also deal 25% of Burnout&#039;s AoE damage for the duration of the ability.~~\nThe movement speed bonus is reduced by 15% of the original amount every second. Shyvana&#039;s auto attacks increase Burnout&#039;s duration, up to a maximum of 4 seconds.\nDragon Form: The range of Burnout increases to 350 / 365 / 380 at rank 1 / 2 / 3 of Dragon&#039;s Descent.\n\nCooldown - 12 seconds--&gt;12/11/10/9/8\n\nRange - 325\n\n\n\n**E: Flame Breath** - Shyvana unleashes a fireball forward in a line that will mark all enemies it hits, dealing 60 / 100 / 140 / 180 / 220 (+70% of ability power) (+ 0.3 per total attack damage) magic damage to them. The fireball stops upon colliding with an enemy champion. Shyvana&#039;s basic attacks against marked enemies deal bonus magic damage equal to 2.5% of their maximum health.\nDragon Form: Flame breath explodes when it hits an enemy champion or reaches its destination, dealing 100-160 (at levels 1-18) (+30% of ability power) bonus magic damage and leaving behind a flame zone. The zone is 220 / 240 / 260 units wide (at ranks 1 / 2 / 3 of Dragon&#039;s Descent) and deals 60-120 (at levels 1-18) (+20% of ability power) (+ 0.1 per total attack damage) magic damage per second. Enemies that remain in the flame zone are persistently marked for Flame Breath&#039;s bonus on-hit damage.\n\nCooldown: 12/11/10/9/8\n\n\n\nR: Dragon&#039;s Descent: Passive: Shyvana&#039;s basic attacks generate 2 fury, even in dragon form or against structures. While in human form, Shyvana will also passively generate 1 / 1.5 / 2 fury each second.\nActive: Shyvana transforms into a dragon and dashes to a target location. Enemies along her path take 150 / 250 / 350 (+100% of ability power) magic damage and are pushed toward her target location. Shyvana must have a full fury bar to use this spell.\nWhile in dragon form, Shyvana gains 150 / 250 / 350 bonus health and her attack range is changed to 175 / 190 / 205. Dragon form also increases in size by 8 / 16% at ranks 2 / 3.\nWhile in Dragon Form, Shyvana will lose 5 fury every second. Once her Fury bar is empty, she will return to her normal state.\n\n_(New)_ **While in Dragon Form Shyvana may recast R and dash 50% the distance, but for a fury cost. Enemies may only be damaged and knocked back by 1 part of the Ultimate.**\n\n_(New)_ **Unique Riot Mechanic: The first wall Shyvana travels over when she ults will be permanently destroyed so that all units can now walk through where the terrain used to be.**\n\n_(New)_ **Recast cost: 50/30/10**\n\nRange: 850 _(New)_ **Second cast: 425**\n\nPretty much just made this just to give out some ideas I have for Shyvana since she is a severely dated champions that needs some changes. If you have any questions ask away. Also constructive criticism is welcome.","replies":[{"poster":"ChaosReyn","date":"2019-01-15T20:58:54.018+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"*hits 6*\n\n*Instead of ganking, just busts down multiple jungle walls with double-dash ulti to make counterjungling even easier*\n\nI mean...balanced?\n\nas much as I love the idea...idk if having a champion that permanently breaks down all the walls in the jungle is a good thing. Especially not on Shyvanna: she's known as a queen of counterjungling, cause her burnout clear is absolutely nutty once she has literally anything invested into it. She could literally just bust down all the walls leading anywhere and make your jungler cry post 6.\n\nAnd that's not even mentioning the part where she can just focus on blasting away *all* of the walls on her own side of the jungle to both speed up clear times on her end (no dodging around terrain) make counterjungling her almost impossible (no terrain block means she's gonna see you coming from miles away) and make it absolutely impossible to try and funnel her team into a crowded jungle area, because there will be no walls to force a crowd.","replies":[{"poster":"Frosted Tips","date":"2019-01-15T21:51:57.533+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean it was mainly just put in as a meme.

Personally, I think buffing that +5 armor and mr to +10 will more practical (since even Riot said that +5 is literally there for the sake of her lore). I'd say giving some sort of hp scaling for her abilities (preferably her w, since right now it is nothing but a ms buff when you reach late game), since she really doesn't benefit from building full tank or full ad due to her brusier nature.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Raiyza","date":"2019-01-15T22:20:02.222+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"All I ever wanted for Shyv was:\n\nPassive: Dragon Scales - While in Dragon form, Shyvana gets X amount of Armor and MR, and all of her abilities set her targets on fire dealing so and so damage. \n\nShe's already a very bad version of udyr with no real stick power without Frozen Mallet.

Because if she was strong enough in human form to fight 1v1 than when her Ultimate is just a stat buff she would destroy in a 1v1.

Her E is perfect as is. \n\nR: We can't have the terrain part, it's way too OP. If it's also what I think you were saying that only Shyvana can use the downed terrain it's even more OP.

Burnout deals it’s full damage to dragons instead of 25%\n\nDragonform: The area of the flames increases when Shyvana transforms into a dragon, scaling with ranks in R.\n\n**Q (unchanged)**: Shyvana strikes twice on her next attack, the second attack applying on-hit effects and dealing (+20 / 35 / 50 / 65 / 80% total AD) physical damage\n\nWhile Twin Bite is on cooldown, basic attacks reduce the remaining cooldown duration by 0.5 seconds.\n\n\nDragon Form: Twin Bite cleaves all units in front of Shyvana.\n\n**New W**: Shyvana leaps to target location and smashes the ground dealing 50/80/110/140/170 (+20% AD) damage to enemies around her.  \n\nDragon form: Shyvana becomes unstoppable during the leap and moves  enemies with her and deals an additional 50/90/130/170/210 (+80% AP) Magic Damage to each unit she drags with her.
