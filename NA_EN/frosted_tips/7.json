A champion kit being newer does not make it inherently better. Some of the more recently updated champions like Shaco which you agreed with needs a full VGU even though he was updated in the Assassin Update. Vi is this fighter that is supposed to get into the thick of things yet she has to build full damage to try to assassinate 1 target. If she can not do so she is utterly useless. She does not offer enough CC or take enough hits when building tank to justify building tankier unless you are unable to one shot and then you are an ult bot.\n\nIllaoi is not about how hard she is to face which she isn't. It is that she does not fit any role and can not do any job well enough. She needs a way to kill turrets faster to be a scary split push champion or she needs better ways to deal consistent damage in teamfights.\n\nMalphite I believe could be fixed with minor changes. Like a larger delay on his ultimate to free up more power to be added to the rest of his kit. Maybe a new Q and the just number changes and scaling changes after that. But he could aslo just get a full VGU.\n\nHecarim is one of the worst feast or famine champions in the game. He should get an update soon because he has been relatively neglected.\n\nHaving to build a grevious wounds item and qss to fight Nasus is not ok. He needs a new passive, and either a new E or a new W. 2012 was almost 7 years ago.\n\nRek' Sai is one of Riots greatest failed releases up there with Ivern. She needs tremor sense removed or a complete overhaul. That champion can't be balanced with free information early and a super strong early game kit. It is as oppressive as Nidalee in her prime.\n\nRenekton needs some kit modernization. He is one of the most binary champions left.\n\nSince when is Quinn a top tier VGU champion? When didRiot say this? All champions are functional, that is not my issue with any champion. It is how they interact with the current champion roster and the game in general. Quinn just needs some way to feel better to play as and against since no one likes facing her she is in this state that also isn't much fun to play anymore.\n\nHow to start fixing Ryze: Remove the point and click, ranged, hard CC, that is on a basic ability.

She takes towers as well as most juggernauts, and she can handle a good number of opponents that might try to stop her. Her tentacles need some QoL, like a bit different way to set them up cause her passive can either destroy her or help her, and they need to not be visible in fog when attacking in a spot with no vision.

For someone who’s supposed to be more of an anti-AD champ, he doesn’t always seem to feel that way outside of his W passive. His ultimate and Q spam tend to be his most complained about skills though, and ult is his only hard CC and no way to refresh defenses in combat for an extra spike of tank, and his AP build is just too much at times.","replies":[{"poster":"Frosted Tips","date":"2018-11-16T23:35:32.602+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> She takes towers as well as most juggernauts\n\nOk but the rest of the juggernauts have more CC and teamfight potential than her.\n\nYou undervalue Malphite E against champions.

He still doesn’t quite fulfill the anti-AD as much as he possibly could. His armor bonus is the main thing, and the cripple for autoattackers. Everything else feels separate. His model and lore desperately need updating though alongside general gameplay, which puts him more in VGU territory.
