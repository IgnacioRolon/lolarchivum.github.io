On top of that, I also am stuck with a 30 minute queue time. I've sent in a ticket, but is there any idea on what to expect or can a Rioter help me out here? \r\n\r\nIt's extremely frustrating to just be trying to queue ranked with a friend and to have this happen twice in a row and make it where you guys can't even play a game together.\r\n\r\nI know this is seemingly a widespread problem, but I do believe that the players this happens to should at least be compensated in some manner.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-14T21:20:27.385+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The rare instances where we provide compensation for issues are when they're caused by issues from our end. I took a look into this and I wasn't able to find a record of service incidents during the matches you've played recently. Since you've submitted a ticket, I recommend continuing to remain patient while a member of our tech team gets back to you. They have the technological prowess and tools necessary to assist you in finding a permanent fix. \n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]}]}
