Of course I ran through the troubleshoot support. None of them has worked for any other including myself. This has been happening since 7.17 and there has been no sign of helping us out. I mean c'mon Riot, I can login only after like 15 attempts. Can you do something about this at all? It seems to be a trend for most of us and there has been no news of assistance at all. I've been trying many things and searching solutions for hours.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-02T02:26:52.304+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"We definitely do our best to help out here on the boards and in tickets! Doesn't look like you've posted anything in the past two years, but ayyy glad to see you made this your first stop for help!\n\nIf it's taking you 15 attempts to login, but eventually you *can* login without changing anything, it's likely due to an unstable connection that you eventually got lucky with. Let's trouble your network settings a bit to see if there's anything you could spruce up to give your network an easier time connecting to our authentication servers. Go through the steps in this [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues#section-mac), but do make sure to do the steps on port forwarding and flushing your DNS.","replies":[{"poster":"Derpsaaan","date":"2017-10-20T11:47:12.481+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have done all of the above and have seen this response to many other discussions. I have gone through the list at the connection guide multiple times and everything seems to be in check. There seems to be nothing wrong with my connection as the people around me using the connection has no problem at all. I believe it's just a Mac problem and not a connection issue. I infer this as the people I know that uses Mac for League has the same issue while my roommates that have Windows have no problem whatsoever. Anyways, thanks for trying to help.","replies":[]}]}]}
