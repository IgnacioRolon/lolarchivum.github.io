It takes like 5-7 mins to log in after I press the sign in button. Furthermore it takes another 5 minutes or so after I am trying to get into solo ranked. One time I decided to sit through the entire process and after about 25 minutes I finally got into the match. For some reason my ping skyrocketed to 400 and it was so laggy that I couldn't do anything .\r\nYesterday I reset my windows hoping that it would help and after 10 hour long setup I am still heaving the same issue.\r\nPlease help.","replies":[{"poster":"jjuxtap0se","date":"2017-06-16T03:24:16.462+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The issue seem to be resolved - everything is back to normal.

It almost sounds like your network might be having a few issues with packet loss which is what's making it take so long to login. Let's test for that really quickly to make sure that's not the case. Hit up this [**log reader**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743) and use your latest game logs. Take a screenshot and post it here so that we can go over it together!","replies":[{"poster":"jjuxtap0se","date":"2017-06-16T02:39:24.684+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for the reply.\nhttps://i.gyazo.com/74682aa1ebf6d42fb87b489ac62dd67f.png\nHere you go. As can be see the connection is not an issue(never was till now)\nAlso guess I have to mention that I am in Japan at the moment and my ping is usually 157, which is actually totally fine.","replies":[]}]}]}
