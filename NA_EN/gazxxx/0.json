I know i'm pretty much ranting but i'm sure plenty of people can agree something needs to change to make the solo ladder competitive again. Autofill removed from diamond+ would definitely help reduce the coin flip, this would sacrifice queue time but who wants to q into an automatic loss?? the next step would be some kind of int detection system, people soft int nowadays and the old detection system just doesn't see behind the scenes. Agree or disagree I just want to see what the community thinks.","replies":[]}
