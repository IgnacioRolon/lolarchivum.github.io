From 5 HP/5, to 1.25 HP/5 A FREAKING 45 GOLD VALUE, LOL.\r\nRavenous Hydra will only give 5 HP/5, compared to its original 15 HP/5. From 15 HP/5 = 540 gold value, to the original value of a rejuvenation bead, a 180 gold value. This reduces the Stat efficiency of Ravenous Hydra to 107 percent gold efficiency from 118 gold efficiency.\r\n\r\nA lot of people will argue that, who cares, it's Riven, it's not like Health Regen matters on a champion like that. Truth be told, every little thing counts, and considering the fact that you're  cancelling out a build path (getting Rej beads early) and making them practically worthless, it still has an impact on Lane phase. It's one thing to nerf a champion while buffing something else, but this patch merely nerfs Riven and does nothing positive for her.\r\n\r\nI'm not saying Riven needs a buff. I'm just saying that rebalancing her by buffing her health regen a little in order to compensate for the changes would be nice instead of flat out nerfing her, even as little as it may seem.","replies":[]}
