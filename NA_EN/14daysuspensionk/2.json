First of all, his shield doesn't look like it does in his splash art, in his splash art it's sorta oval shaped,  but in game it's more like an octagon, which doesn't make sense to me. Why doesn't the shield match his splash art?? I know that champion models don't always accurately match their splash arts, but this is a bit ridiculous. Aslo, why is he wearing sandals? xD.","replies":[]}
