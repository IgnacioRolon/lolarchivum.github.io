The page still exists, though. You can type it out, or type part of it and let your browser fill in the rest based on your past history, or you can keep a tab open, or you can bookmark it. As far as knowing whether you need to go there at all, the effort hasn't actually changed on average. Instead of refreshing some other page (thread listing, a thread, etc.), checking notifications, and then going to the updates page if necessary, you can just keep the updates page in another tab and refresh only what you're interested in: the thread listing to look at new threads, or the updates page to see if you have new replies.\n\nYes, I know, it's surreal to have to do this for a website from a billion-dollar tech company in 2020, but here we are. Happy 10-year anniversary.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"GreenKnight","date":"2020-02-06T22:52:57.938+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Yeah, we should've predicted that this would happen.
