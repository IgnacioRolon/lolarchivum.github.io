They have three cocky rookies, an ADC who is easily top 10 in the world right now, and a top laner who is known for both his collection of scarves and his uncanny resemblance to a snapping turtle. The fact that they chose not to practice at all before MSI also helps, but still. If I were a team in the EULCS next year, I'd probably make it my goal to not just beat G2 but do it in such a dominating and convincing fashion. Make'm learn their lesson for turning what is a pretty important worlds-related affair into a clown fiesta.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Grim R3aper","date":"2016-05-06T10:58:45.040+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"rip skt","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lugg","date":"2016-05-06T15:02:48.073+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wouldn't say NA is better than EU just from MSI. G2 is a new team that doesn't have much if any experience against international teams.
