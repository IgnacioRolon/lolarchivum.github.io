The ground is super deep and massive so throwing a few stones shouldn&#039;t deplete the earth. Since Yorick&#039;s grave digger and I assume he summons ghouls by the dead bodies inside the ground, the worked earth mechanic makes sense on him. There should be limited dead bodies inside the ground so Yorick shouldn&#039;t be able to keep summoning ghouls on the same spot until the dead bodies are replenished with souls or whatever. This also fixes the anti-fun nature of his laning phase. I also think Mord&#039;s ultimate ability belongs to Yorick&#039;s. Yorick&#039;s a grave digger so he works with dead bodies. You know the dead champion bodies that stays flat on the ground after they died until the player is revived? Imagine Yorick&#039;s ultimate allows you to click on one of them and summon a ghost copy of that champion and function exactly like Mord&#039;s ultimate. \r\n\r\nThese are my thoughts.

Malphite and Maokai basically spend the entire team fight in the thick of everything spamming everything they can and still accomplish very little by themselves.
