What i mean is Akali shroud does no dmg but her other 2 non abilities get scaled to do as much dmg (include CD not just abilities dmg)) as other champs 3 non ults, making them stronger in every way.\n\nYou see this over and over, another great example is ekko who basically just fishes for free kills because his qwe are over stacked then just using his R to escape.\n\nchampions with high mobility should have over all lower ability not a little but significant yet they don;t they get equal dmg and then just gain the advantage of their mobility/utility and actually get to put out their dmg even faster. This is why league of legends balance team is turbo trash. Even sadder is every new champ and rework keeps doubling down on this incompetent design balance.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BurakkuRozu9","date":"2018-10-08T17:08:41.382+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":4,"body":"Interesting Topic.","replies":[]},{"poster":"chipndip1","date":"2018-10-08T22:01:13.996+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":6,"body":"Immobile champions are usually harder scalers than mobile champions, but of course we're not going to ACTUALLY think about that.","replies":[{"poster":"Grunt666","date":"2018-10-08T22:38:25.970+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=chipndip1,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=n2Y3UMuj,comment-id=000c,timestamp=2018-10-08T22:01:13.996+0000)\n>\n> Immobile champions are usually harder scalers than mobile champions, but of course we&#x27;re not going to ACTUALLY think about that.\n\nUhm no they arent lol, like literally just spew random lies and pretend they are facts hahaha.","replies":[]}]}]}
