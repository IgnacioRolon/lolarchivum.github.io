All rights reserved to the original artist and publisher of the art.\n\n_**Lore:**_\nMany have been lost to the Void. Not everyone have been as lucky as Kassadin and Malzahar. Many who have gone to the Void might have avoided the smaller voidlings, but found themselves encountering more vicious Void Terrors. One of these was, or rather, were Rylor, a Voidborn creature that resembles its previous self very little. Where as most Voidborn feed on the flesh of their victims, Rylor found delight in feasting on the lifeforce on its victims instead and with it, their souls. With so many souls running through Rylor, not having a true escape, Rylor&#039;s own being was fed up with these souls and changed, making it more humanoid, but making it&#039;s previous feeding desire into an unquenchable hunger for more lifeforce, willing to destroy it&#039;s own being if it means it gets just a small taste of more lifeforce. \n\n_**Abilities:**_\n\n**Passive:** _Essence Personified_\nLifeforce: Whenever Rylor takes damage, he builds up lifeforce on a 1 to 1 basis, persisting through death. His maximum Lifeforce is 200-1000 (scaling with level). Each point of lifeforce reduces damage dealt to Rylor by 0.02%. If Rylor has not gained any Lifeforce in 5 seconds, it falls off at 5% per second. \nPast lives stolen: When Rylor dies, their ruined spirit lives on. For the remainder of their deathtimer, they are capable of moving around like normal and cast spells. Their spells deal no damage and they are incapable of using items and summoner spells. Their vision range is reduced to only that of allied units and they are unable to be targeted, however their Lifeforce can still build up.\n\n**Q:** _Reap_\nCost: None\nArea: 350 units\nCooldown: 12 seconds\nRylor lashes out, hitting all enemies around him, dealing 100/180/260/340/420 (+80% AP) massive damage, reduced by 50% to minions and monsters. 300 units behind all champions hit, a chunk of essence will drop for 5 seconds, healing the first champion that walks over it by 25/45/65/85/105 (+20% AP).\n\n**W:** _Fatal Attraction_\nCost: None\nCast Area: 600 units\nMax Area: 800 units\nCooldown: 12/11/10/9/8 seconds from cast\nRylor grasps out, trying to pull all enemies to his location. All enemies are pulled towards Rylor at a speed of 80/120/160/200/240 units per second and take 15/30/45/60/75 (+20% AP) damage every second for 4 seconds. The duration of this spell is increased by 1 second for each 300 health Rylor loses. Enemies affected by this are capable of acting otherwise normal. Enemies moving out of range of this spell while under its effect become unaffected by this spell. Multiple uses of this spell can be in effect at a time.\n\n**E:** _Burst of Essence_\nCost: All Lifeforce\nArea: 800 units\nCooldown: 2 seconds\nPassive: 5/10/15/20/25% of the damage that allied champions would take from enemy champions is dealt to you instead (cannot reduce you below 5% health). This is reduced to 2/4/6/8/10% while Rylor is dead.\nActive: When cast, Rylor uses all his accumulated lifeforce, splitting it equally between allies and enemies, healing all nearby allied champions and dealing damage to all nearby enemies. No target can take up more than 25% of the lifeforce used. Rylor can&#039;t target enemies with this ability while dead.\n\n**R** _Torrent of Life_\nCost: 10% max hp per second\nArea: 800 units\nCooldown: 90/80/70 seconds from completion\nRylor immobilizes themselves, drawing life from all nearby enemies equal to 3/6/9% (+1% per 150 AP) of their current health, healing Rylor for the same amount. Enemies affected by this ability are also slowed by a percent equal to their percent missing health. While in this state, Rylor can still cast all his other abilities. Rylor can at any time reactivate this ability to stop it it and any hard CC cancels this state.\n\n_**What did I try with this champion?**_\nI realise that void champions are way too overdone, but the idea of the W was what initially was the idea of the champion. Sort of a tentacles pulling people towards the champion kind of thing. From there, I came up with the theme of thirsting for lifeforce and I could not find another way of doing that than have a Voidborn champion. I also wanted a champion to be able to move around while dead for a long time and I sort of thought it might work well for the champion and as so, I tried. Now, the W seemed like it would do wonders in a teamfight, so I wanted to have a very teamfight dependant champion, meaning having a very big ultimate. The E placed him firmly as a tank and the Q was made to give him a very strong burst, making sure you wouldn&#039;t want to come close to him when his W is up and would also give him some mean sustain in lane if used correctly.","replies":[{"poster":"breakordoom444","date":"2016-12-07T06:00:31.072+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"question, with his \"past lives \nstolen \" can the enemy champs see him, if so can they damage his spirit? it doesn't make sense in reality but its league, ignite hurts brand.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninja Baby one","date":"2016-12-16T01:30:42.347+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"(Sorry for a late responce) The enemy would be able to see him and I would say they should be able to damage him, but I don't know how that should work, for if he could still take damage from all sources, it'd make him capable of blocking skill shots, which I don't think a dead champion should be able to.

Yet there are a few problems that i can see with this champion (and please do not take this to heart). \n\nFirst off the passive Essence Personified, is actually really cool, has decent scaling, especially with the dmg reduction (which should be upped a bit, due to high damage carries like Vayne, Cait, or like Poppy, for example), the percentage rate needs a bit of a nerf (minus 1.5% off of it and you should be good). What i didn't like was\n\n> Past lives stolen: When Rylor dies, their ruined spirit lives on. For the remainder of their deathtimer, they are capable of moving around like normal and cast spells. Their spells deal no damage and they are incapable of using items and summoner spells. Their vision range is reduced to only that of allied units and they are unable to be targeted, however their Lifeforce can still build up.\n\nNow while this is really cool, and does bring things new, i think it should be removed as it is almost a carbon copy of Karthuses passive. I feel like if you really want the theme you are going for (a void reaper like character if i am reading the lore correctly), you should make his secondary be something like  _Past lives given_ where when he dies if he has any allies near him he can transfer over his life essence giving the person some damage reduction, while he can keep the rest depending on how much he channels, which would be really innovative to league as a whole as we don't have champions like that. Also them building up life force when dead in my opinion does not fit in with the theme too much.\n\nNext the Q the only thing i see is that the damage should be reduced, but scale hard during late game, that damage alone is close enough to one shot someone if you go glass cannon (due to the +20% of AP scaling, the healing part of it you can actually keep (as i am assuming it heals enemy champions as well).\n\nThe W is what i have the really big problems on so let's break down as to why.\n\n> W: Fatal Attraction\nCost: None\nCast Area: 600 units\nMax Area: 800 units\nCooldown: 12/11/10/1/9/8 seconds from cast\nRylor grasps out, trying to pull all enemies to his location. All enemies are pulled towards Rylor at a speed of 80/120/160/200/240 units per second and take 15/30/45/60/75 (+20% AP) damage every second for 4 seconds. The duration of this spell is increased by 1 second for each 300 health Rylor loses. Enemies affected by this are capable of acting otherwise normal. Enemies moving out of range of this spell while under its effect become unaffected by this spell. Multiple uses of this spell can be in effect at a time.\n\nMy first problem is the speed at which people are pulled, mostly that, the AP damage is fine, but could be toned down by like -5. \n\n> All enemies are pulled towards Rylor at a speed of 80/120/160/200/240 units per second \n\nThis is my big problem, the speed is just to high in my opinion especially at rank five (that's close to Rivens old projectile speed for her ult). While this might be all and good, people are going to rage (if that is your intent, then i salute you), yet I'd say reduce it by at leas 20, make it slow at first, then make it scale harder, like very hard (like a blitz pull) late game. My other problem is this\n\n> Multiple uses of this spell can be in effect at a time.\n\nMostly since i do not get what you mean, but the way i read it, is if you have enough CDR you can cast it over and over, that would not be viable it's pretty much like a constant slow, and that would be all he would be used for, which would make playing him stale quite quickly. I would say that when he uses this ability as champions move towards him they are slowed the closer they are (as they are closer to his grasp), the pull part is good and can work, but adding that would make that a really stand offish ability and make other wary when they see, or they themselves are getting pulled and can't escape.\n\nOnto his E.\n\n> E: Burst of Essence\nCost: All Lifeforce\nArea: 800 units\nCooldown: 2 seconds\nPassive: 5/10/15/20/25% of the damage that allied champions would take from enemy champions is dealt to you instead (cannot reduce you below 5% health). This is reduced to 2/4/6/8/10% while Rylor is dead.\nActive: When cast, Rylor uses all his accumulated lifeforce, splitting it equally between allies and enemies, healing all nearby allied champions and dealing damage to all nearby enemies. No target can take up more than 25% of the lifeforce used. Rylor can't target enemies with this ability while dead.\n\nNow this is a really good ability, i actually really like this one a lot since it's simple, easy to understand, and good enough where nothing really need to be changed, aside form the cool down. The cool down is my biggest problem as it is so, so short. That needs to be buffed up to about 6 or more seconds, as once again it would make playing him stale, he should also not be able to use this ability if he has no lifeforce. That and the passive is pretty much a buffed bond of stone mastery. The passive should be removed, entirely or rewritten so it doesn't seem like a really buffed Bond of Stone.\n\nThe active that's alright, especially since he can't do it to opposing champions when dead, but allies should only be able to take 5 -25% (scaling by level of the ability) the opposing champions however should take more (at least up to 35%).\n\nNow onto the R.\n\n> R Torrent of Life\nCost: 10% max hp per second\nArea: 800 units\nCooldown: 90/80/70 seconds from completion\nRylor immobilizes themselves, drawing life from all nearby enemies equal to 3/6/9% (+1% per 150 AP) of their current health, healing Rylor for the same amount. Enemies affected by this ability are also slowed by a percent equal to their percent missing health. While in this state, Rylor can still cast all his other abilities. Rylor can at any time reactivate this ability to stop it it and any hard CC cancels this state.\n\nThis ability is a bit confusing at first when i read it, since to me with the 10% hp reduction almost sounds like a reversed Mundo ult. Which is all good, that can be kept. The cool downs are a bit to low later on as it should be fairly consistent like put the first one as like 130, then go down to 115, then 90 seconds (as it makes people need to plan around it, on both sides). Now the ratios are good, nothing wrong with that, hard CC canceling it, also good. People being slowed? That is also good, but the slow, and just the slow, should be bigger as this itself is a hard CC ability, the slow should be like the slow on Braums ult when people step in it.\n\nOver all this champion is actually fairly decent, not to overpowered, but not to udnerpowered ether. I do understand what you're trying to do, and this is just my two cents on it.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninja Baby one","date":"2016-10-08T14:24:27.249+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First off I must thank you for writing this much and putting this much thought into my concept.\nNow, to quickly say what I think about your comments :)\n\nThe passive at max level is supposed to give him a 20% damage reduction when he's taken 1000 damage in a battle without using his lifeforce. The quick falloff is so you actually would use it on his E if you are out of combat. And I don't feel like the second passive is much like Karthus' passive, considering Karthus is alive to deal more damage, while this guy can only give utility in his dead state. I do see what you mean, but the fact that this guy can't deal damage while dead is the important part of the second passive.\n\nThe drop of the Q can indeed be picked up by enemies and it's easier for enemies to pick it up, considering it spawns on the other side of them from Rylor's perspective. I thought this would allow for Rylor to have more damage on the Q, but I do see that the numbers might be a bit too high.\n\nThe W needs a rescaling of damage, sure. I however feel like you have not understood the W properly (from the Riven ult comment), which I was scared people might not. If an enemy has 330 ms and are running directly away from Rylor, they're pulled towards Rylor by 240 units per second(At max rank) meaning they would have a resulting speed of 90 ms away from him. With these numbers, I do see that it's too high of a pull speed, I just needed to make sure you've understood it right. :3 It should probably be around 180 at max rank instead. As for the multiple casts stacking, as it is now, it's too easy to have plenty running at the same time with it's current cooldown, I see that. The idea was you could extend the duration of the W beyond the cooldown by taking enough damage and you could then pull people faster in (more than their own ms). I didn't think of CDR however, so I do see that its cooldown needs to be bigger. A slow wouldn't work in this spell, because the ultimate is supposed to slow by a big amount and a slow on this aswell would be too much.\n\nThe E's passive is like Bond of Stone, yes, that was the idea, but I do see that it might be too boring to be a copy of that. Maybe just change it so he gains lifeforce from nearby allies as well? The cooldown of the spell was set low so you could keep using the lifeforce if you're being focused to dish out some damage, giving him the option of removing his passive damage reduction for a heal and some damage. I realise that this could also work with a higher cooldown, but it would then be a question of when to use it, not if you should use it.\n\nThe R's cooldown might be too low for a teamfight ult. I though the cost in health could go up for that, but I understand that won't really work. I will increase the cooldown in the future :3 Why the slow should be bigger though, I don't get. It's a 800 radius area with a slow that's potentially 50% if you're on half HP. No one can attack in, though of course some spells could reach him while he's casting. \n\nOnce again, thanks for the comment. I will definately take some of this into consideration, but not everything will make it into future itterations. :3","replies":[{"poster":"CritterZoid","date":"2016-10-08T17:39:24.313+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Ninja Baby one,realm=EUW,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=MfHMlm18,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2016-10-08T14:24:27.249+0000)\n>\n> First off I must thank you for writing this much and putting this much thought into my concept.\n> Now, to quickly say what I think about your comments :)\n> \n> The passive at max level is supposed to give him a 20% damage reduction when he&#x27;s taken 1000 damage in a battle without using his lifeforce.

I will definately take some of this into consideration, but not everything will make it into future itterations. :3\n\nI am glad you did not take this to heart like most other champion concept designers, so i thank you for that, i am also very thankful you understood that this was constructive criticism. \n\nWhile i do understand that passive now, (since the damage reduction was slightly confusing at first, since i couldn't calculate how much it would be at max rank. While that is true, and you're absolutely right that Karthus is supposed to deal more damage when his passive is popped so to speak, my question though (that i forgot to put in my original ramble), is when his passive is first used, does it have a cool down that does get shorter as time goes on? \n\nWhile yes i did not understand that W completely, i did try to understand it as much as i could (hence the riven's ult comment, as that was the best way i could actually put it for me to understand it completely). I do see your point on a slow being to much, well another slow on another ability. Aside from that you have out the W together really well, so it is actually a good ability.\n\nI do like the fact you recognized that it is like bond of stone, and i do like your change to the E ability or your champion. The reason i feel like the CD on it should be higher is for play making and strategy, that was what i had in mind. Really with the ability it should be a question of when/how to use it (since i'm thinking of this from a support main perspective).\n\nI am also glad you recognized that the cool down on the ult is too low. The slow being bigger is to provide more of a presence and to be able to keep certain hyper mobile champions near your champion so people can dish out damage before they manage to leave, unless they are at the edge of the 800 radius of the ability, where the slow will still be crippling (but like braums ult fades away due to being close to the edge), but they could get out, if they're not bursted down so to speak. Maybe tone down the units a bit? (seeing as i do not know how much 800 units would equate to the in game summoners rift).\n\nYou're very welcome for the comment, i am happy to offer constructive criticism, since i would love to one day see a fan champion actually in the game, as that would be cool. That is understandable everything not making it into future iterations, though i do hope to see more champion ideas from you! :)","replies":[{"poster":"Ninja Baby one","date":"2016-10-08T20:54:41.867+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for all the nice comments :3 I do plan on working on more champion concepts in the future, but I feel like I use more time on each champion than the average poster (this champion fx having been in the idea stage for weeks), so they're going to be few and far between :3","replies":[{"poster":"CritterZoid","date":"2016-10-08T23:01:15.109+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Ninja Baby one,realm=EUW,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=MfHMlm18,comment-id=0001000000000000,timestamp=2016-10-08T20:54:41.867+0000)\n>\n> Thanks for all the nice comments :3 I do plan on working on more champion concepts in the future, but I feel like I use more time on each champion than the average poster (this champion fx having been in the idea stage for weeks), so they&#x27;re going to be few and far between :3\n\nThat is completely fine no worries, stuff like that takes time :3 It takes me years to write some champion concepts in general.
