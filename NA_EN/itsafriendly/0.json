Those are single-target and the damage is directly affected by AD items and has limited variability. For ADC for example, their build paths are restricted to a handful of items, so you can calculate their total ADC, their crit chance, their AS, and then balance lifesteal accordingly. Regardless if you are Vayne, Lucian or Lulu, if you build AD+lifesteal, you will get roughly the same numbers (obviously there are differences in base stats and any potential steroids, but not that huge).\n\nWith spellvamp, though, the spells are much more variable. You have single target, AoE, DoTs, low cooldown spammable spells like Karthus Q, high cooldown nukes, spells that don't affect minions. It's much harder to find a single number that works for all.\n\nAlso, ADC don't have limited autoattacks. Obviously, they have a certain Attack Speed, but you can instantly change targets in the middle of the fight and accordingly change your lifesteal numbers. Mages, on the other hand, have cooldowns, so as far as spellvamp is concerned, a spell used on a tank is a spell wasted that you won't be able to use again for a few seconds. This, combined with the varied nature of spells makes spellvamp feel unreliable, as you get very different numbers depending on the champion, spell and target.","replies":[{"poster":"3tyson","date":"2015-07-05T15:23:33.912+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This because jinx and twitch dont have aoe auto attacks","replies":[]},{"poster":"Martyrofsand","date":"2015-06-06T05:26:42.191+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thing is it isn't as difficult as you make it sound.

Specifically if you are calling out spellvamp, but not lifesteal? \n> \n> It is a niche stat, but the champs that use it have kits designed around it, I don't think that is proof of anything being wrong with it.\n\nI believe the problems Riot have with it are:\n\n- Spells can impact in AOE, which has a million complications in it. Right now Riot just says \"33% Spell Vamp for AOE\" but this is really lazy - a spell can at one time hit one person and get 33% healing and at another time hit 10 minions and still get that 33%. It's quite hard for a wide selection of champions to benefit from a stat that is tuned in such a limited way considering how many different ways Spell Vamp can be procd. This is compared to lifesteal which is always single-target and always at 100%, being completely standardised for all champs who build AD.\n\n- Spell Vamp healing, if strong, can be very bursty. Riot don't like burst healing (I seem to remember) because it leads to people being able to withstand a lot of burst just because they used a high damage ability. Lifesteal is consistent and in small amounts, whereas Spell Vamp will heal for a different amount with each spell and with particularly high damage spells, can give you a ridiculous amount back (think Veigar or Syndra R). Also, one of the main counters to Lifesteal as a survival mechanism is CC and target denial because Lifesteal needs to be continuous to work out. Spell Vamp is unlike that - if you get locked up in CC and survive the lockdown, you can press all your buttons in about a second and heal everything you would have done if you'd spread those spells out over 5 seconds.\n\n- Spell Vamp as an accessible stat has a lot of weird implications - an excellent example of this is Akali, whose passive is often complained about. Because Spell Vamp scales with damage done, it favours burst mages and especially assassins above everyone else. Imagine a strong Spell Vamp stat on Katarina - suddenly her ultimate heals her from 10% to full HP as well as destroying your team. Bursty characters aren't designed with sustain like that in mind and giving that much sustain to bursty characters as a whole could create total chaos.\n\n- Lifesteal as a stat has some problems that pop up on occasion, particularly with sustain-heavy bruisers such as the likes of Olaf, Tryndamere and Aatrox. As a stat it can turn tanky damage dealers into raid bosses that are unkillable except by 1v5 focusing. Spell Vamp being stronger and more accessible has the potential to create similar problems with AP bruisers - you can already see problems with Vladimir in this department and I expect you'd see similar cases with champions like Swain, Cass, Ryze and maybe even Elise. The game really doesn't need more champions with the ability to turn into raid bosses as the game progresses.\n\n\nThey're all the problems I can think of :P I feel like Lifesteal is balanced on a knife-edge and Spell Vamp has infinitely more complications regarding its balance than Lifesteal, so I just don't know how it can be balanced.","replies":[{"poster":"Ale non è male","date":"2015-06-05T23:31:57.427+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> **Spell Vamp being stronger and more accessible has the potential to create similar problems with AP bruisers **- you can already see problems with Vladimir in this department and I expect you'd see similar cases with champions like Swain, Cass,** Ryze** and maybe even **Elise**. The game really doesn't need more champions with the ability to turn into raid bosses as the game progresses.\n> \n\nRyze? Elise? Come on\nSpell Vamp is not much of a problem as you may it look like\n\nRyze problem wasn't with Spell Vamp and will not be Spell Vamp. Ryze problem is: should a champ be able to spam relentlessly skill chained one-next to other while remaining healthy for the game? The problem on old Ryze was that it was all a matter of range, if he had too much range he would wreck anybody, otheriwse he was useless. Add this to his very efficient offensively and defensively itemization based on mana, and you got possibly a monster which dealt tons of damage while being unkillable, and Spell Vamp (both ulti spell Vamp and eventually acquired with items spell vamp) was only the cream on the top of what was the deeper problem. Deeper problem that has been probably mainly solved thorugh Ryze rework that at least mitigate the problem by limiting the moments where Ryze can keep spamming spells, and new Ryze revolves about this management, again Spell Vamp becomes just the cream on top of a Ryze playerthat is wrecking enemies by his onw ability\n\nElise has literaly one spell on which she can apply full Spell Vamp and is somewhat spammable (not even that much in reality), and is not even that spammabale as the short range put her anyway in danger so have sustain rather than damage become an extra strategic choice, not an overbearing thing\n\nOn Swain, Vladimir can Spell Vamp represent a problem? Yes, but it makes them basically invincible in what were yet match-ups really favourable to them (or the ability of the player make them favourable), as they are limited by range first and foremost. While it IS true that LOL, unlike DoTA, does not aim to balance champions by making all of them unbeatable in certain situations, and Spell Vamp could make Swain, Vlad that some times, it is also true that it is actually possible to play around their kits with enough champs that honestly it becomes more a problem of tweak some numbers and skill mechanic (hey, I'm looking at you Vlad Q CD at later levels) than throw in the bin Spell Vamp completely\n\nCass... well, is the same question as Ryze old and new kit, and it relies more on actually resetting CDs and earning power and dealing damage through hitting Twin Fang and the numbers of her kit rather then being a problem of Spell Vamp that is eventually just the cream on the top of the cake which represent eventually the core problem (just as Vlad and Swain)\n\nThe claim on Spell Vamp helping burst mages and assassins is kinda skewed, too. The problem of burst mages and assassins remains the one to find balance between their abilities to kill the target and the possibility of the target to reply or not allow burst mages/assassin to dish that damage without being in huge danger to die. Use Akali as example does not work because Akali had different problems, the spammable skills and being manaless with low CD and being capable to regenerate easily energy while being capable to going in stealth mode baing non hittable and receive armor/MR on the old twilight shroud if you could spot here + a respectable ulti range before the nerfs, and Spell Vamp only worsened the situation without being the true roots of them...and as a matter of fact when Akali was hit by those other nerfs, people have not had a legit reason to complain about her unkillabilty since then even though the Spell Vamp is the same and potential damage outcome - and thus healing given by Spell Vamp - has ever increased IF she can get in range, which is much more dangerous and difficult\n\nIt is true that Spell Vamp could/should be changed, but not because it is  really unhealthy to the game right now in terms of overall balance, but because it does not actually represent a strategic choice if build Spell Vamp or not...it is just a stat you build on few champs because they need it desperately and you pretty kind ignore on everyone else, while it should really be a strategic item build path that give an alternative to the actual ones available for AP champs, as partly happen on lifesteal that represent a secondary but still relevant factor in picking AD champs build and certain items over other","replies":[{"poster":"WarlockLaw","date":"2015-06-06T01:05:41.501+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"He was saying that if spell vamp became somewhat stronger those champions would become borderline unlikable.

There have been several suggestions, but Riot is unlikely to attempt any changes until both obstacles are secured, and they can afford to focus on it for the benefit of a target audience of casters.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Awaken","date":"2016-04-17T22:44:30.830+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"i feel like you should keep spell vamp or put it as a passive on champs","replies":[{"poster":"The Awaken","date":"2016-04-17T22:44:56.866+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"because i love vlad and akail","replies":[{"poster":"Meep Man","date":"2016-04-17T23:17:55.574+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"From the grave","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Rebonack","date":"2015-06-05T17:41:21.047+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"I've said it before and I'll say it again.\n\nSpellvamp from items no longer heals you.  Instead, it gives you a shield that lasts for 4 seconds or so and stacks akin to Bloodthirster's passive.  That solves the 'bursting at full health' issue that makes spellvamp pointless on most Mages.  Make it give 1/3rd the value against minions/small monsters and 100% against large/epic monsters and champions.\n\nDone and done.","replies":[]}]}
