One day my friends (they are also in Gold btw) and I met a Master 1 player who clearly does not have the skill level to be in master tier. Judging from the player&#039;s skill and the fact that we were matched against such player, I think that the player may have bought the account. Anyone know what riot does to those people??","replies":[{"poster":"twchris13579","date":"2016-08-19T11:35:50.295+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can't judge a players overall skill from a single normals game.  Thats like deciding if you'll marry someone or not after 1 date.  Master tier players are allowed to have off games like everyone else, they are allowed to not play their best at all times and they are certainly allowed to try out new builds/champs etc.\n\nThere are dozens of reasons why a Master player would do poorly in a lower elo game.  Also he was probably matched with you because he was queued with other lower elo players.\n\nYou can't make accusations like you did just because you think you know why someone is playing bad.  In fact based on the way you handled this I bet you flamed him in game and then reported him afterwords for intentional feeding.","replies":[]},{"poster":"EndlessSorcerer","date":"2016-08-11T13:30:54.126+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Players can have off-games.  They won't always be at peak performance, especially in normal games.\n\nThe player may have been practicing/learning a new champion or role when playing.  Some players are quite capable of maining a few champions into Master tier (i.e. Druiddroid with Singed, Annie Bot with Annie, Heisendong with Heimerdinger), but that doesn't mean that they are able to play all other roles at the same level.\n-----------------------\nIf you are referring to the Master tier Vayne in your recent Karma game, then a quick check would show that they are primarily a Support player.  They were Diamond in S4, Master in S5 and against in S6.","replies":[{"poster":"Mr Yi","date":"2016-08-19T06:54:28.105+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think you understood the claim here. The account was a MASTER tier playing with golds with a skill lv of low gold / high silver. Also the account doesn't main support, it mains bot lane, \"a quick check\" would say that the account played support and adc the most with a very high KDA","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"xXxAlta√ØrrxXx","date":"2016-08-11T13:21:54.156+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nothing, why u care?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2016-08-11T07:51:56.096+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Account sharing/selling is a bannable offense.
