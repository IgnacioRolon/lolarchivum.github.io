So, I've been scrolling through the threads about bans and I wanted to see how and why people whine about their bans. Some of them are right, some of them are wrong, but according to the people who commented back, all of them are wrong and all of them deserved their bans. They have to deserve their bans, that's why they got banned, right? I mean, the system cannot be wrong, even if it's governed by humans and it doesn't matter if humans make mistakes and every human is subjective. It doesn't matter, they deserve it. All of them deserve it, right?\r\n\r\nNow, I never got banned, but come on, all of them are wrong? Really? I mean, I feel like when someone sees people complaining about a ban, before even reading the thread, they immediately think that they deserve it from the title and their judgment towards them shapes by the effect of their prejudices. And they look for words and sentences to prove that they _did_ deserve the ban. Yeah, and in my opinion, people with prejudices are as bad as toxic people. And if you're one of the people who think that you're \"nice\", and have prejudices too... I'm afraid to say that you're bad. Evil. You're just one of the evil people who think that they're good and have a twisted morality and who thinks that they're always right, no matter in what situation.\r\n\r\nDon't be prejudiced.

And if you&amp;#039;re one of the people who think that you&amp;#039;re &amp;quot;nice&amp;quot;, and have prejudices too... I&amp;#039;m afraid to say that you&amp;#039;re bad. Evil.

It clouds your judgment towards the people who are right.\n\nThis is how the human race is now, man.  VERY few people are actually nice these days.  Most of the 'nice' people you see around here are actually toxic themselves and white knights.  They follow the rules and act like they're better than everyone else in a completely broken system that has no basis on anything in real life.  In real life, context is always judged.   That's why Venus Williams was found NOT GUILTY of manslaughter even though she hit someone in a car.  Because it wasn't her fault.  League doesn't care whose fault it is, only that \"you did something wrong.\"  The league equivalent of this is knowing that the stoplight was broken in advance or being smart enough to see that there was a problem with the stoplight, and knowing not to go through it (translation: being a near perfect person).\n\nYou can see the toxicity of the \"nice\" people by their cookie cutter responses, expecting everyone else to act like Paladins or something here.\n\nYes, that is excessive hyperbole but you get the point.\n\nThere ARE nice people in this world but 1) very few of them play ranked, unless they are low elo and extremely casual, 2) they are near perfect people mentally with VERY thick skin and extremely extraordinary compassion and virtue. 3) those people don't exist--the ones that do either go pro, or aren't good enough at this game because they don't have the mentality to climb.  Because having that mentality basically FORCES you to be toxic.  It's part of competition in general.  \n\nNow being completely abusive on the other hand...there's a difference between being toxic and being abusive.  \nYou tell someone to kill themselves, you call them the F word or an N word or talk about their mom, you're abusive.  Someone says you bought your account off ebay and they insult your play and you get into an argument without cussing or calling them F bombs, you're \"Toxic.\"\n\nAll humans are toxic.  Even the do-goody church goers are toxic.\n\nHow do I know?  Because I've lived on this planet long enough to learn things about people.

They dont know any better, They want to take there anger out and have a good time, not be banned over some hyper offended person who cant even be spoken to without freaking out.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"EL HAMSTERO","date":"2017-12-21T08:46:36.577+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"please dont take the people who post/vote on the player behavior board too seriously.  they are definitely not a normal sampling of LoL players.\n\nthe majority of people come to this section of the boards because they feed off suffering and misery.  they come here because they love hearing about bans and how distressed the players are after losing their account.  \n\nit is no surprise most in this section believe every ban is justified and even seek bans for lesser offenses.  the more the suffering of others to grows and spreads the happier they will be.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-12-21T08:36:06.089+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can you provide examples of logs that you think should not have been punished but were?\n\nIt would definately help with your point if you had examples to back you up.","replies":[]},{"poster":"kittenCorn","date":"2017-12-21T08:34:56.524+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My thread isn't even related to me receiving any sort of punishment but it was immediately down voted.\n\nI completely agree with you. Considering my situation I've also been reading through this board. Some of the bans seem justified. Some do not.

Basically any sort of clarification.\n\nBut I can bet you these people condemning everyone would be the first to post here if they got banned.

We all see so many terrible things every day, and a person telling you to \"kys\" offended you? Honestly, if you are so fragile that anybody telling you anything can hurt your feelings, you need to see a psychologist and stop playing online games. This isn't my first game and most games had a ban policy against homophobia, sexism, and racism, but none against personal or even religious insults. Snapping and cursing is a part of human nature, if anything, it's a venting tool for the frustration caused by the bad players. I could even go as far as to say that we are encouraging players to stay bad when they know they can ban anybody who gets mad at their lack of skills and reason.\n\nI'm actually surprised this community is considered so salty when there are so many banned people every day, one would expect there would be none left. But it's like we're trying to create a utopia for all the special snowflakes that can't handle bad words and report at the first sight of \"you are pathetic\" and \"you sad sad child\" - as the guy who got a 14-day ban said. Unfortunately, they are the majority here, so there's not much grown ups can do.","replies":[{"poster":"SoSButters2","date":"2019-09-12T10:45:52.932+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Totally agree with you. Unfortunately Riot baning system sucks. I am playing 10 years lol and since last year they start to ban accounts very easily without checking what really happened. I have 2 permanent bans and i can't say i deserve it. First of all what exactly is illegal? What is flame? Which is the prohibited phraseology that Riot bans? They never told us. Riot bans are unfair and has to do with words ONLY, not situations. They dont care if someone provoke you or someone is messing with you in your promo or someone is afk cause he CAN. They dont care about the cause and the effect. RIot system has to do with a bad algorithm. An algorithm which locates bad words and with the report help u are just banned in a few seconds. Is this fair? Of course it is NOT. Example: I participate in a game and i want to troll. I dont say anything to chat. I am only play bad in purpose. I give some kills but carefully so nobody can report me for intentional feed. My teammates starts to get mad cause someone play his promo or someone want despertally the lp points. So after that attitude it is normal my teammates  starts to chat me using warning words on the begining but as long as i play bad and troll they start using more heavy words. After the game ends which is a typical defeat due to someone's trolling i am sending reports against all of my team. What happends? RIot sending bans to all of them. SO what really hapened there? I got trolled, i lost my promo, i lost the game of course, i lost lp and guess what? I GOT ALSO BANNED! Why? cause under scope of Riot i was GUILTY....and the one who really ruined the game and was the REAL  troller was innocent...so...The troller continues his games and never get banned......He will for sure make other people angry at the next games and of course new bans are coming for his victim teammates. So do you guys consider these bans FAIR? I dont think so. I lost two accounts because of that. I make lots of tickets but riot the only thing they can do, was to answer me gently and polite like i am 12 years old kid, thats there is nothing they can do and that i deserve the bans. \nCONCLUSION: Riot ban system care only for words in the chat. They dont care about the REAL cause which leads to flaming. So this ban methodology  itself makes you worst person at the end of the day cause you feel that there is no justice out there... You become worst and you start to feel that you need some kind of redemption. I really dislike myself for had to say that but if riot continues like that, to ban people which dont deserve the ban....SOONER or LATER all of them they will come back with new accounts starting to troll every single game in a way that they canot be banned BUT they can destroy other's game. Is that what Riot wants? I DONT THINK SO! BUT MARK MY WORDS. IT IS GOING TO HAPPEND OR TO BE MORE REALISTIC IT IS ALREADY HAPPENING.\nI HOPE RIOT SOME DAY WILL GIVE ATTENTION TO THIS MAJOR SUBJECT CAUSE NOBODY WANTS TO BE BANNED FOR NO GOOD REASON.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Gustavo Gustave","date":"2017-12-21T17:52:23.461+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"I just got ban 14 days for that lol            \nTifanoe: maokai 1vs1 1000ap Veigies one shot/This is unreal/My GF dumb me\nTifanoe: pokimane1 what %%%g\nTifanoe: pokimane fucking anoying egirl get out\nTifanoe: varus 1/15 you can't talk %%%got\nTifanoe: report kassadin %%%got\n\n\n\nAnd this 1/15 varus is not going to be ban good job riot, I'm taking a break of league I already lost too much time","replies":[]}]}
