Otherwise, you may have been looking at a 25-game chat restriction instead. Whichever word you used here is totally unacceptable (there are only a few 6-letter words censored by the Boards, none of which are good). \n\nPerhaps you should take the 14 days to reflect on your behavior in-game and your attitude towards your teammates. Even without looking at the one line that probably escalated you, you still tell people you're playing with to kill themselves and that they're useless. This is also not considered acceptable behavior and if it continues, you'll easily fall into a permaban.\n\nIf you care about your account, you should take more care when using chat.","replies":[{"poster":"Prank Bot","date":"2017-07-11T07:20:07.955+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"dude this guy should consider himself lucky, i skipped my 10 game chat restriction-2 week ban and went straight to friggin permaban and my ban card had no instances of hate speech.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Void Nargacuga","date":"2017-07-10T17:42:04.861+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did you mean to lock this thread?

Such is the nature of moderators, they have access to tools that help keep the boards clean. With great power comes great responsibility, and I feel this is a responsible way to use the power. Typically when voting is disabled, comments are also disabled, and the thread is locked. Vote manipulation, although rarely a problem, does happen sometimes. I wanted to take an opportunity I had to test out reactions to a thread where you could still participate in discussion, but not use the voting tools. \n\nIf you disagree, or have concerns about any moderation action (including this one), you can always join us on the [Boards Discord](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/community-moderation/qVlculPP-boards-moderation-discord) and discuss it with us directly.
