They even tried **unbanning** people. Twice. Over 95% of players given another chance after a permanent ban either remained toxic in chat and were re-banned quickly (meaning they just ruined more games before getting banned again), or they resorted to trolling/griefing (meaning they just ruined more games.... you get the idea). So no, Riot isn't going to make an exception for you because then they'd have to do that for everyone, and that increases toxicity in games.\n\n>Being treated like its preschool.\n\nNo, you're simply being asked to not be an asshole to others. That's not just preschool, that's life.\n\n>Also another point I believe if I cant get my account back then I should get a refund on all i spent.\n\nWhy? If you buy a ticket to a sporting event and are ejected for violating the rules of that stadium, do they refund your ticket? Nope. If you buy a subscription to, say, a streaming TV channel, with the stipulation it's for personal use, and are kicked off it and banned because you were using it at your business (commercially), do you think you get a refund? Nope.\n\nYou agreed to terms as part of your purchase. You broke those terms.\n\n>Taking hundreds of dollars and I cant have it back after what I believe is an unfair perma.\n\nThey didn't take it. You gave them it.\n\n>I am  by  no means a toxic player\n\nYour logs and the fact you are acting this way after multiple warnings says differently.\n\n>but when people talk trash I'm not just gonna sit there and take it.\n\nThat's your right. Riot has the right to set rules that you can't do that, and if you want to violate them, you can. Riot has the right to enforce their rules and to prohibit you from using their services.\n\n>People in chat literally can say anything they want to me without punishment\n\nThey are subject to the same rules you are.\n\n>but because of past actions I am just banned after 2 insults, crazy. ;(\n\nThere's a hell of a lot more than 2 insults.

No one who is a paying customer should be banned for that given the climate of this game in general. You being banned don't stop people from being toxic in my games, so why should I support a poorly made punishment system. \n\nWhy should the amount of money spent prevent someone from being held accountable for their behavior? Sure permabans doesn't stop everyone from being toxic in games but that doesn't mean they shouldn't exist at all. By your logic the police force irl should be disbanded simply because criminals will always exist. Just because the punishment system will never completely remove toxic people from the place (no system can) doesn't mean that it's poorly made.\n \n> Perma bans should go away for behavior reasons, its silly. \n\nWhat's silly is expecting not to have your access to something permanently revoked if multiple warnings and lesser punishments fail to get you to shape up. Like any establishment if someone refuses to behave themselves despite multiple warnings then they should have their access to that place permanently revoked. Not only are they disrupting business with their poor behavior but they're also driving potential customers away.

Thus in their eyes, they have already written off the toxic player as a paying client.\n\n>From a business standpoint, do they want to remove the toxic guy who has spent $500 but is causing a negative environment for 4-9 other players in every game? Those non-toxics are also spending $500 and probably will spend more, promote the game more when they are enjoying the game AND they won't cause a negative environment.\n\n>I personally think it is a fine argument to protect the ones that are paying money and aren't toxic rather than protecting the ones that may pay the same amount but are toxic.\n\n_______________\n\n> I would just report them to the Better Business Bureau as a consumer. \n\nYou do realize that the BBB is very unreliable right?\n\n> If you do make another account however, just shut your mouth in games, and you'll be fine.

Acting like the OP did in their chat logs is not fine.","replies":[{"poster":"CominTowardsYa","date":"2019-11-11T02:09:29.001+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"You do understand that I will never advocate for someone losing their money and time put into a game for a behavioral reason, right? We will never agree on this. \n\nI have this stance because with regard to real life, police and laws, you pay a fine or do jail time. So I reasonably would expect a less permanent punishment for something in a game where you can make purchases on average $5-$100 a pop and lose it all in one shot for a racist comment. \n\nNo need to explain the way the system works, I am fully aware, having been subject to it's dumb suspensions and almost losing thousands of dollars in RP purchases because Riot can't figure out how to take the chat client out of their game, and instead punishes paying customers for playing in their Toxic Arena and expects adults and grown ups to figure out their problems for them, or pay with a perma ban. \n\nRiot is unreliable with their ToU and rules, nothing is concrete and paying customers should be given more protection over what they put their hard earned dollar into. \nHench why I say, perma bans should not exist in this game, only chat bans, or Riot should disable chat completely so we don't have to worry about the troll wars in games, and put our money on the line.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
