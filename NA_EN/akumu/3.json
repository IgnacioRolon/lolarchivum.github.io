Meanwhile mixing both Armor and Magic Resist shards gives you such a trivial increase in durability that its hardly meaningful.","replies":[{"poster":"nfzeta","date":"2018-11-26T00:09:03.832+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the mixing and matching being kinda crappy is intended. You can all-round but it won't be that good and if you stack 2 armour or 2 mr it counts for a lot more than the 20ad/ap because of how early armour works.\nI may agree with your option for offence only but that may still bring in problems.","replies":[]}]}
