Dying gives gold to the enemy. If you just keep on farming without dying, you're not giving gold to the enemy so you're not punished for farming, just for dying. Adding gold to your bounty is not a punishment lol If it is then just stop playing and just try to get assists so that your bounty never goes up.\n\nDo you consider Riot is punishing you for getting kills? I don't, same goes for CS.","replies":[{"poster":"ROYALR3IGN","date":"2018-11-21T17:11:37.629+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How often do you normally have a perfect game without dying? If you use the assumption that you're going to die at least once after minions spawn it punishes you for farming. I'm not sure at how many CS that the bounty begins to kick in, but lets be practical everyone's going to die eventually in a match. There are the odd games that are a clear stomp and even then the people doing the stomping still die.\n\nSo yes in theory you are right, if you proceed to farm like a beast and never die the whole game then yeah the bounty system doesn't punish you. But realistically with damage being so high, I don't know how often you can consistently not die every match. \n\nAlso, yes I do consider the bounty system as a form of punishment for getting kills, whether or not its a good mechanic or a bad mechanic is a different issue entirely. (Personally I think its fine but it does inherently punish the team with the kill streak.)","replies":[{"poster":"HommeGoujon","date":"2018-11-21T18:34:23.130+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"No I agree you'll more than likely die once or more during the game. \n\nThat being said I think it's just normal that you become a valuable target if you've got more gold than the enemy team on average. \n\nYou get +50 gold on your bounty if you got 250g coming from CS more than enemy's average income coming from CS. Then you get +50 for every 150g beyond that point. Note that it's only counting the income since your last death. \n\nIt doesn't seem that big TBH and if you're the only lane ahead in terms of CS then you should be fine since the enemy team's average CS is likely pretty high/equivalent to yours. If your whole team is ahead then you should have at least vision control & objective control as well so it should still be easier to end the game.\n\nI've played a few games yesterday and I think the amount of your bounty is almost only coming from killing the enemy champs or turrets.\n\nMaybe I'm wrong but so far I haven't seen it become a big issue where a 0/5 player had like a 600g bounty (it must happen but it should be rare).","replies":[{"poster":"Nightsky Pirate","date":"2018-11-21T19:37:01.158+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is an issue when you are 2-0 with less, but still decent, CS.\n\nThey then get more bounty than you got with your two kills.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"zoliking","date":"2018-11-21T10:12:24.599+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"It means you had a 1450g bounty on you and it wasn't handed out to the other team in one go.
