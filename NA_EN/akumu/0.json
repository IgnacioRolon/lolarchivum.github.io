Although to be fair the issue isnt simply that this much damage is possible in league the issue is that in these instances the champion in question had almost no items. Vi didnt even have her ult for fuck sakes, if she did it would have been an even bigger joke. Diana hit me with only one R before the shield saved me and she has not one single item complete, 3 components from 2 different items and not even fucking Sorc shoes? \n\nHow the fuck is it okay for damage to be this high with so few items? But i guess according to Riot its working as intended. Just pick a champion with a gap closer buy one item and mash your keyboard for free kills. FYI it doesnt fucking matter if 'x build is useless in teamfights' if the champion snowballs out of fucking control from the instanteous kills he gets with 0 effort.","replies":[{"poster":"Backup4now","date":"2018-01-10T09:14:18.281+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would attack the fact that too much damage happens too early with no effort, lead, or strategy, but these clearly do not matter to the rioter.

So one-combo kills are bad?  Ok... there go assassins in general.  And most divers too, since we can't have them being able to one-shot an underfed squishy that's bought no defenses.  When vulnerable champs are tanky enough to survive on their own, defensive supports aren't needed either, so we'll toss them too.  Tanks will also be less useful unless they're putting out damage too or they're utter CC machines like Leona or Maokai... and even then, they'll mostly be used to hold enemies down for long enough to kill, since everyone will be tankier.  Juggernauts will probably be ok, and nearly every champion will need to resemble them to survive.  Ironically, by making carries tankier, everyone has to be tankier too since fights drag on for longer.  If every champ is made more naturally tanky, even the carries will be let down... since fights are now long-drawn out slogs buying all damage on them will feel less impactful.

The job of an assassin is to quickly remove a carry or other squishy but high priority target.  You seem to think that this doesn't mean they should be able to actually KILL their targets quickly... for some reason.  Assassins that cannot kill their targets are damned close to useless... since they offer very little else to their team beyond their single-target damage and mobility.   \n\nIn the scenario you mentioned above... how is chunking a carry to 25% of his health worth giving up a spot on the team to an assassin?  Mages can do that.  Fighters and bruisers can often do that.  Other carries can do that.  Your example makes no damned sense.  You are suggesting that only badly injuring a carry is enough, but it is not.  A carry at 12 HP hurts as much as a carry at full HP, and now his team has time to save him with heals, shields and so on.  If, as you seem to think, a carry reduced to low HP will be unable to help in a fight... isn't that the same damned thing as killing them?  If they're rendered unable to help thanks to the assassin, then it doesn't matter if they're dead or not, because they're not helping fight.\n\nBut they AREN'T useless.  The only Hit Point that really matters is the last one.  As long as that twitch is alive, he's dangerous and there is NO point to assassins if they can not remove their target from the game.  Making it take longer to kill a carry (and gee, I wonder if you play carry champs to hold these opinions on how things need to stop picking on them...) just means that bruisers and juggernauts become the new \"assassins\".  Because killing the carry is still essential to winning a fight.  So your plan ultimately boils down to \"I want to be killed by tank Ekko now, not Zed.\".\n\nThere is an entire class of champions devoted to protecting squishy carries from the big, bad assassins.  If you're that offended by burst damage... play Janna support and prevent it.  Or play Kayle and press R to ignore it.  Or just stop pushing your opinions as if they're right just because you believe in them while discounting everyone and everything around you telling you that you're wrong.","replies":[{"poster":"AMYS GRAVE","date":"2018-01-10T16:42:42.682+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> Mages can do that.

As in they do a lot of damage in the first few seconds of a fight, then usually have to flee or fall back because they blew their cooldowns.  They do not do good damage over time.  In a teamfight an assassin will not last if he has to wait for a 4 second cooldown before he can finish off a carry unless said carry is both alone and stupid.  If nothing else, they'll just leave... as the assassin has likely blown his mobility spell to get to the carry in the first place.

You don't need to 100% HP someone before they can react to have an influence on the teamfight.

When they went full AD (or full AP based on the champ) they still assassinated quite well. Unfortunately tank assassins were a product of two overtuned items in sunfire cape and iceborn.
