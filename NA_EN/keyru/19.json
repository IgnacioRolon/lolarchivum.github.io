The main functionality for this channel is to help have direct communication to moderators on the Boards regarding discussions/posts that break our Universal Rules. We&rsquo;ll still be actioning normally if reported through the existing reporting method but this gives an extended avenue that players can use if they would like to give a more detailed report.\n\nWe&rsquo;ll need you to register first in our Discord verification thread [here](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/oANjm0W4-discord-verification) and the moderators will get you setup in our channel. When you want to report, head over to #gameplayreports and use @moderators ONLY and a moderator will pull you into their room to discuss the report privately. Do note that this feature is a privilege and access will be removed if abused.","replies":[{"poster":"Malicious Metal","date":"2016-12-05T20:38:04.636+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"inb4 Mordekaiser threads being outlawed.","replies":[{"poster":"AttackOnTeemos","date":"2016-12-05T20:51:12.045+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Malicious Metal,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=L9YiGhdF,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-12-05T20:38:04.636+0000)\n>\n> inb4 Mordekaiser threads being outlawed.\n\nbr?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"StrikerX22","date":"2016-12-10T08:01:45.082+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I recommend you either sticky this thread too, or make it extra clear this is a place you can have discussion about it, in the other thread.

Like, you're doing the right thing now. But you utterly fucked Curse Voice back in the day, then decided to invest in them, then do to Discord what you should have done to Curse Voice in the first place. Like, who even does that? Why not invest in Discord? Discord didn't have a LCS team that would be forced to re-brand if you invested in them. You support & publicise information about Discord more than something you actually have a stake in.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Imperial Pandaa","date":"2017-03-03T21:42:01.423+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Imperial Pandaa","replies":[]},{"poster":"AttackOnTeemos","date":"2016-12-05T20:37:15.768+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What if we just wanna say hi :C\n~side note first post!~","replies":[]}]}
