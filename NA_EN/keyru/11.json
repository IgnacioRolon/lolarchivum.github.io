A lot of you have provided really good feedback about moderation as part of our wider discussion regarding the updates coming to the NA boards [Part 1](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/site-feedback/Ep4t0zPw-lets-talk-about-the-boards), [Part 2](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/site-feedback/Hx8p6GoX-letos-talk-boards-organization), and [Part 3](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/site-feedback/bWE8wUIE-lets-talk-boards-org-part-two). Hopefully I can provide some insight into how we look at moderation as well as where it&rsquo;s going.\n\nFirst, for clarity, as many of you may know we partner with a third-party company called Metaverse in moderating the boards. I&rsquo;m actually responsible for that relationship these days, and have been working with Metaverse closely on to make sure we&rsquo;re aligned on what&rsquo;s working and what needs to improve. \n\nOne of the major points of feedback we&rsquo;ve heard from you guys concerns the level of transparency and visibility around moderation on the Boards, so that&rsquo;s obviously been a big part of both our internal planning and my latest communication and alignment efforts with Metaverse. Ultimately, we&rsquo;d like both the specifics of our moderation policies and the mechanics of how they&rsquo;re implemented to be more clear to you guys. To that end, I&rsquo;d like to provide some info about changes we&rsquo;re planning to shortly make to moderation guidelines and processes on the boards. Here&rsquo;s the current list:\n\n**[FUTURE CHANGE]** Modify the Universal Rules to be clearer and on-point, which should improve consistency for both players and moderators. For example, here&rsquo;s a snippet from the current draft of the updated Universal Rules:\n\n> ***Spamming / Trolling***\n>\n> Here is a breakdown of the various types of spam / trolling that the moderators look for and will take action upon:\n>\n> * Posting content not related to the discussion\n> * Posting designed to bait conversation or falsify content\n> * Making repetitive non-constructive or low effort content\n> * Bumping of discussions with no additional context\n> * Excessive emoji / icon spam\n\n**[FUTURE CHANGE]** Concurrently with the updated Universal Rules, begin holding Boards posters more closely to the letter of the rules and be more aggressive when it comes to enforcing them (no more 50+ violations without being banned). We&rsquo;re diligently working to ensure the updated rules are easy to understand, comprehensive, and representative of common values shared among members of the League community. Ideally, the rules should be simple to follow, and the lines clear - when they are crossed, appropriate action should swiftly follow. \n\n**[IMMEDIATE CHANGE]** Institute a blanket policy across all sub-boards, including GD, disallowing conversations regarding religion, race, politics, sex, and social issue topics unrelated to League of Legends (i.e. online legislation is ok, fracking legislation is not). This is an interim step to aid adjustment as we move towards eventual new Universal Rules, sub-board guidelines, and moderation policies as a part of the overall boards updates.\n\n**[IMMEDIATE CHANGE]** Update moderation notifications to more accurately inform players of both the reason for their punishment / warning and the consequences. While deleted comments aren&rsquo;t visible, mod messages will include both a copy-paste of the actionable comment and a direct URL for the discussion in which the comment was posted. Here&rsquo;s an example of a message a player would receive  for using a racist, homophobic, or sexist term:\n\t\n> Hey XXX,\n> \n> We here at Riot do not condone the use of racial, homophobic, or sexist slurs. You have been given a final warning and 7 day suspension. Please be more mindful in the future of those around you.\n>\n> Here is your comment:\n>\n> [QUOTE]\n>\n> And a link to the thread in which it was posted:\n>\n> [LINK]\n\n**[IMMEDIATE CHANGE]** Going forward, we&rsquo;ll be replying and answering in more moderation based discussions, about general policies or specific actions that have been taken (myself and HurriKane aka Moderator Kane will fill this role for the time being). This should help with transparency and let players know our thought process on why we take certain actions. Long-term, we&rsquo;ll be looking to give these conversations a more specific sub-board home (along with wider Player Behavior conversations) as part of the upcoming boards reorganization. \n\nWe also continue to work with the Boards dev team when it comes to prioritizing features, and the same goes for moderation related ones. Some of the things we&rsquo;re interested in developing (no promises) include:\n\n* Moderation appeals\n* Ability to respond directly to moderation notifications\n* More report options and an open text field\n* Personal Boards blacklist/muting feature\n* Ability to move discussions instead of deleting them, where appropriate\n\nOf course, let us know which of the features you feel are most important as well as any other mod-related ones you&rsquo;d like to see.\n\nAs mentioned in the bullets, we&rsquo;re pushing a couple of these changes live immediately (i.e. on Monday, 7/20). Us hopping into more moderation discussions and better notifications are all upside, while the interim blanket rule against particularly unrelated discussions should mostly be a light corrective measure to the worst excesses and help ease transition towards the eventual new Universal Rules. Obviously, this last change will most significantly affect GD, where the updated rule will be reflected in an addition to the sub-board guidelines pending new Universal Rules.\n\nGoing forward, we&rsquo;ll continue to develop updated Universal Rules and of course share them with you guys for discussion. Further down the line, the Player Relations guys are planning to kick off a discussion around our (currently still vague) ideas regarding community mods / MVPs. We&rsquo;d like to explore with you guys how that kind of system could  potentially enable players to feel more ownership over their Boards and their moderation. \n\nThe moderators, myself, and the rest of the NA boards team would love your feedback, so feel free to share any thoughts you may have on moderation!","replies":[{"poster":"Norscout","date":"2015-07-17T05:07:57.963+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":2,"body":"The problem I have with that rule \"low effort\" post, is...it just seems like an arbitrary rule that can be punished based on whatever mood the mod is in.

As an example, what action would you expect the moderation team to take against a thread that's talking about social unrest in <insert foreign nation here> and is generally constructive?\n\nActually, I see lower in the thread you mentioned the following:\n\n\" the interim blanket rule against particularly unrelated discussions should mostly be a light corrective measure to the worst excesses and help ease transition towards the eventual new Universal Rules\"\n\nI think that answers my question.\n\n---\n\n>Update moderation notifications to more accurately inform players of both the reason for their punishment / warning and the consequences.

At the current time, this is not possible so we have to delete and inform the poster of the deletion and encourage them to post in the right place. This will not count as a violation to the individual unless they are purposely doing so.\n\n> In the short term, will this type of content be based in the Boards Feedback board or just kinda pop up wherever it happens?\n\nWe'll be actively looking into where they pop-up but for the time being the best place would be in Boards Feedback, Miscellaneous, or General Discussion.\n\n> I'm not actually sure whether this would be a positive or a negative overall, since ideally moderation should be handling the fast majority of content we as participants might want to remove.  What reasons do you see for adding this feature?\n\nThis is a good question and exactly why it's only in the thought process currently for a possible future feature. In the particular case that I can see, maybe a player is feels they are getting trolled by another but the troller is not necessarily breaking any rules so we won't take action. This allows the player to have the ability to not interact with them in similar ways the mute/block system in-game works.\n\n> Very much looking forward to this, as I'm sure many others are as well.

I think the whole \"clarity\" aspect is really needed and healthy.

We're still aggravated that GD is being removed, fine, whatever (not happy lol), but we're still a community and we all want \"off topic\" posts to remain. I don't, and we don't, think it's fair for any chance of that to be removed. I don't know what you guys have planned for that direction, but we're not going to be happy if things end up that way and that'll lead to a lot of bad directions.

First off, I don't see why this is \"future but unsure\". A \"report with an open text box\" is uh... Standard on like, every single website ever. Why should this be any different? It doesn't take long to code (seriously, do it in a lunch break), and it makes things easier. What's the downside? Are you like, afraid someone's going to be a child with it and just write up some stupid things or what... I mean honestly this is going to do a lot more good than harm, I have no idea why this is on the \"maybe\" list. It could be done in less than a week really easily. I don't know why you guys insist on being so slow on this.\n\nPersonal blacklist/muting feature: Same thing. If we can mute in game we should be able to do that here. Actually, everyone with FEK does. Why is a 3rd party doing something you guys should? Just being blunt and honest-- not trying to be a jerk but constructive; I know this is going to come off harsh.\n\nUnsure on the moving discussions but we'll see...\n\nAnd finally, the moderator appeals I understand why that's a maybe for a hundred different reasons, but I'm glad you guys are considering them.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI suppose that's all I have to say, so thank you for your time.\n\nBest Furry NA/Valiant Sentinel","replies":[{"poster":"Tundra Fizz","date":"2015-07-17T02:44:54.847+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Valiant Sentinel,realm=NA,application-id=bzRrPGQO,discussion-id=gQYTAEMl,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-07-16T23:42:07.239+0000)\n>\n> Actually, everyone with FEK does.

But is that necessarily a good thing? You may believe so considering that this is what Riot has decided on, but I think the community would disagree if these were fully implemented and enforced by mods. How much wiggle room does this plan have going forward? You've mentioned that this is a conversation, or is this a statement of \"This is what we are doing, what do you guys think (We'll read the feedback, and say we've heard you, but probably not change anything.)? Because let's be honest, a LOT of the changes on the boards have been presented that way, and there is a current track record that makes it difficult to trust that there is going to be some honest conversations happening between the Boards Dev Team and the community.\n\nSpeaking of community, these proposed changes (parts 1-3) not only remove GD, but destroys many aspects of it's culture. Now, Keyru, you, d'art, and the rest of the team may be at a stage of utter disagreement with me when it comes to the value of GD. I personally believe that there is no reason to remove that culture, and doing so only alienates one of the loudest and most loyal portions of your fanbase. I'm not convinced that this is healthy. Perhaps long-term for the Boards it is healthy, but it could be argued that long-term health would be in condensing communication: instead of Twitter and Reddit and Facebook and Boards, having one centralized location is FAR more beneficial to the long-term health of the Boards, compared to removing GD.\n\nModeration. As I mentioned earlier, the fact that you don't even mention visible moderators makes it sound as if that is entirely off the table. Why? Let's talk about the pros and cons about visible moderation, and moderator accountability. As we've seen over the past few months, mods have been neither better nor worse when it comes to \"Not removing content that shouldn't be removed.\" but what HAS been better in that regard is Riot's response to improperly removed content. Visible Moderation Action is important, especially when we're talking about long-term platform health. Not just making the communication with the person who has had action taken against their account (that should be a no-brainer, we all agree!) but making the action available to the greater community. This provides visibility to proper (and improper) actions taken. No more witch-hunts. And no more invisible mods. These are absolute musts, and any conversation about moderation changes MUST revolve around them.\n\nAnd here is the hardest part of all. We need a concrete timeline. We get it, things get pushed-back. _Then communicate those changes needing additional time, and reasons as to why if you can._ But regardless, we can NOT continue down this path of updates seemingly haphazardly and without messaging (i.e. when a specific 4-letter word was suddenly a word worthy of banning and censorship) these things are damaging to the community, especially with the \"new\" relationship the community has with the Boards Team since it has undergone massive  changes. You have to commit to communicating changes that are being worked on, and tentative timelines as to \"when you can expect this to be a serious possibility\" because even gameplay and balance decisions get time to sit on the PBE and ferment.\n\nLastly, I applaud the focus on making League forums related to LoL. At the end of the day it is easier to moderate. I think it is a very... worrisome position, to be forbidding a vast array of topics from being spoken about.

Do you want moderators to make a comment every time they make an action? We do have an internal process where we QC actions and speak with moderators when an action was taken incorrectly or if there needed to be some alignment shifts.\n\nI think one of the best examples of visible moderation I have seen is RuneScape back in roughly 2007.  Every moderator was a direct member of the community, and all moderation actions were tied to comments.  Each moderator had his or her own distinct personality, and JaGeX regulated the actions to ensure they matched the goals they had for their forums.  I'll touch on this more below.\n\n>If you are talking in regards to having a comment or log of all actions that are taken, there are pros but also cons that come with it. What is the scalability of it?\n\nThe scalability of completely visible moderation where every action is associated with a public and personalized comment is quite low without utilizing community moderators and potentially a role within Riot directly intended to facilitate a community moderator/MVP system.  **That being said**, there are some potential alternatives that might be worth discussing:\n\n* All moderation actions automatically replace the edited comment/thread with a pre-generated moderator comment detailing the removal.\n* Moderation actions cause a comment/thread to become hidden or unlisted, allowing the user whose content was addressed to view it *in context* but no one else.\n* Community moderators - This is obviously a much bigger topic and should probably wait until the discussion with Player Relations.\n* All moderation actions are automatically shown in a thread in a sub-board with identifying information scrubbed\n\nEtc.  I, personally, am not a fan of the idea that moderators should be the police that make sure the forum is within the rules.  I really love the idea of moderators being role models in the community *as their first duty*, with the added responsibility of moderation.  It's potentially somewhat idealistic, but it's also something that could make for an incredible experience for basically everyone involved.\n\n> Is this somewhat promoting naming and shaming?\n\nIt depends heavily on the implementation, and visible moderation relies *heavily* on assumed trust (which the current system doesn't have yet).  I feel like a moderator coming into a thread and saying something like the following would not be shaming, provided there is assumed trust.\n\n\"Hey Daen,\n\nWe've decided to remove your comment, as we don't feel it is really appropriate for the Boards for <x> reason.  Feel free to post at <y> location if you have any questions or would like to discuss this action.\n\n- Keyru\"\n\nIt's explanatory without being offensive or overly shameful, and it allows other players to see the action and get an idea of the context.  I feel like part of the issue Starlighte is getting at is that it's very hard for players to validate each others' complaints and actions.  \n\nThis was a huge problem with the Tribunal until Lyte started providing public chat logs, and eventually players realized that the system *can* be trusted.  I don't feel like we've reached this point with Boards moderation yet, and visible moderation is like a shock to the chest to get it running.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Starlighte","date":"2015-07-17T03:08:44.068+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Keyru,realm=NA,application-id=bzRrPGQO,discussion-id=gQYTAEMl,comment-id=000a0000,timestamp=2015-07-17T02:41:06.629+0000)\n>\n> The Universal Rules will be a separate discussion topic which I will be open to ALL feedback that comes across in the whys, why nots, or if something needs to be changed or adjusted.\n> \n> I'm curious as to what your meaning of visible moderators is? Do you want moderators to make a comment every time they make an action? We do have an internal process where we QC actions and speak with moderators when an action was taken incorrectly or if there needed to be some alignment shifts.\n\nAs I think this is the most important thing to clear up, I'll address it.\n\nVisible moderation as in, a specially colored/distinguished text from moderators, in place of the removed content, saying why it was removed. An example of this working really well would be MTG Salvation. When threads are dupped or in the wrong area or otherwise breaking rules, there is red text from an admin/mod addressing why the content was removed. Sometimes, content that is not egregious is even left up with a note as to why it is unacceptable moving forward.\n\nVisible Mods as in, each mod (when making an action) has a name associated with them. This is scary for a lot of people, and yes; there are pros and cons. But let's have that discussion, rather than keeping it off the table due to some internal discussion that the community was never privy to. Visibility=accountability. Think about it like the push to have cameras on police uniforms. It exonerates them something ridiculously high, like 98% of the time? (Somebody fact-check me) So why can't that be true for mods? If you're confident in their abilities and professionalism, than them being visible has very few downsides.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"imonly4noobcakes","date":"2015-07-18T14:28:40.098+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"So you will stop trolls in forums but are doing ZERO for trolls in ranked???
