One of the problems we have always faced is getting detailed reports through the normal reporting method. Especially for the niche that is GD, there is always context that we cannot fully grasp or understand in certain scenarios or situations.\r\n\r\nFor a temporary band-aid, we&rsquo;ll be utilizing Discord as a way of directly reporting to moderators. In #gdreport, if you would like to report a discussion or comment use @moderators ONLY and a moderator will pull you into their room to discuss the report privately. Do note that this feature is a privilege and access will be removed if abused. To get access, head on over to the verification discussion [here](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/GD/2pxIgmBE-discord-verification).","replies":[]}
