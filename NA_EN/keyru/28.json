Suggestive content that is deemed by moderation to cross the line will still be removed, so please be respectful of others and continue to keep mature content off the Boards.\n\n---\n\nHello!\n\nWe wanted to clarify our stance on &ldquo;sexy&rdquo; content, and what is or isn&rsquo;t allowed. I&rsquo;ve been discussing this internally with other teams and will be shifting moderation into allowing sexy, depending on intent. Specifically, we will be moderating the difference of appreciating art/cosplay and objectification/sexualizing.\n \nWith intent, there needs to be focus on the appreciation of the artist or the cosplay and not just the physical body. The Thirsty Thursdays discussion is an example where the cosplays themselves were not the intent of appreciation, but the physical body. On the other hand, the recent /ALL Chat episode is an example where the intent of the segment was to showcase the artists and/or cosplays.\n \nImplied pornography, nudity, and lolis are still not allowed within the Boards and will result in a removal and suspension. Direct links to pictures or artist webpages that feature NSFW material (as listed above) will also be removed.","replies":[]}
