So, I am going to remind everybody about the guidelines here:\n\n>GUIDELINES\nHere you can find news and updates about the Boards, and this is the place for discussing the Boards or its community. This includes topics like;\n\n>Volunteer Programs\nBoards Rules and Moderation\nBoards events and contests\nFeedback to improve the Boards\nEtiquette\n\n>Always follow the Universal Rules and make sure you're posting on the appropriate board for your topic. We want a place for everything, but if we don’t keep things organized, the boards become a lot less useful and a lot more cluttered.\n\n>If you've got feedback on how we can improve the Boards or if you encounter a bug with them, let us know here! Remember to vote for content based on how valuable you think it is, and if you are having concerns with our moderation please visit us on the Moderation Discord here.\n\nI am also going to provide some links to where things go:\n\n[Gameplay](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance) - Questions about the game, champions, discussion about the game and champions.\n[Player Recruitment](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/team-recruitment) - For people seeking to recruit for their Esports, ranked games, or people who want to find a group.\n[Report a Bug](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report) - Bug reports in-game (champions, client, a thresh Q being global, etc).\n[Help &amp; Support](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/f/osqw6G4M) - Technical issues belong here (lag, FPS, store not working, servers going down, etc).\n\nRemember, that if you need help finding out where things go, each board has a guidelines section that says what the board is about and what goes there.\n\nThanks all!","replies":[]}]}
