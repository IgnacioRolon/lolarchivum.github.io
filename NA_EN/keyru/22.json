As it turns out, the Boards have actually had a profanity filter all along - it&rsquo;s just been broken on the NA Boards. The Boards Dev team fixed the bug in question, and the filter kicked in automatically with an old list of words. This was entirely our bad for coming out nowhere, and we apologize for any confusion and inconvenience. \n\nWe will not be disabling the filter as it can be useful for spam / phishing prevention as well as truly egregious stuff, but we will be entirely nuking the current list of filtered words for the NA Boards. Right now we&rsquo;re populating the list with known phishing/scamming links, and we&rsquo;re looking to expand the list with other words/terms that the community doesn&rsquo;t want here.\n\nFor the purpose of this discussion, moderators will not be punishing the use of inappropriate language so long as words are 1) simply listed, and 2) not used maliciously. If used inappropriately, we will take immediate and appropriate action. Thanks for participating!\n\nEDIT (9/2/2015 1:56PM PST):\n\nThanks everyone for the suggestions for filtered words. I'll continue to update the list as more suggestions come in that we see should be included. Here is the current list of what will be added by the end of week.

It should but the way I see it honky doesn't have slavery or segregation associated with it. The history isn't there to warrant it to be censored like the other 3 racial slurs I listed. Queer, tranny, homo and faggot are all associated with the homosexual community. Hate crimes happened because of these words, but the homosexual community likes to reclaim words. Some of these words are used in rally cries to express pride in their homosexuality. I would like to censor it when used in a hateful manner but I don't want to take it away from anyone who takes pride in their sexuality. The last three words are derogatory to women. Especially the first one, cunt. The other two can be used against men but alot of the time when used on GD it tends to fall into the \"stock insult\" category I mentioned earlier.","replies":[{"poster":"Dr Poro","date":"2015-09-01T00:28:05.337+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"Why should homos be able to call themselves homo but niggers can't call other niggers their niggers?","replies":[{"poster":"TouchpadExpert","date":"2015-09-01T00:43:47.878+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Dr Poro,realm=EUW,application-id=bzRrPGQO,discussion-id=RM2Ehrh6,comment-id=00180000,timestamp=2015-09-01T00:28:05.337+0000)\n>\n> Why should homos be able to call themselves homo but niggers can't call other niggers their niggers?\n\nBecause the homosexual community has reclaimed these words and changed their meanings to be positive rather than negative.

Whole lives were lost because of this word and not in the terms of death even though that is a major part of it. I am talking about how people were born into a life of slavery because of this word and this word dictated what opportunities were open to them.
