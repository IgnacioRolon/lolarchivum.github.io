If you&#039;re looking to get that flashy icon (gifter receives icon) or want to try your luck of the draw, reply here with your Summoner name and whether you&#039;d like to receive or gift.\n\nRemember that gifting limitations are 10 a day and you will have to wait 24 hours before you are able to gift a newly added friend.\n\n{{champion:497}} {{champion:498}}","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2017-04-27T10:39:38.017+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"If you have not received your icon yet, **this is completely normal**. Icon distribution has been going on over the past few days, and may go on up until two weeks from now. If you don't have your icon by May 11th, 2017, submit a ticket to Riot Games Player Support and they'll be able to look into this for you. Until then, please just hang tight. They're being rolled out!\n\n[This event has since concluded](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/champions-skins/champion-release/xayah-and-rakan-available-now-launch-promotions), but it was awesome seeing everyone in the gifting spirit, and hopefully we'll see a similar event soon!
