If you could get all the quests up front you would know exactly how much you need to grind for the prestige skin, could get it, then dip out for the month. However, Riot are no longer a player friendly company and are more interested in making it a painful grind stretched artificially over an entire month where you technically could do the math in advance but no one wants to, so they just grind endlessly to get the damn thing even though they'll likely spend more time than they have to after the extra quests come in.\n\nRiot feels entitled to like 80% of your free time for an entire month just to get the skin, and not only that but they won't let you finish all the quests up front to accurately gauge how long it'll take.
