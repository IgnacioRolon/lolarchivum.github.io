To follow up with the visible and transparent moderation, I wanted to step in to fulfill that promise. We&rsquo;ve been updating our rules and I thought this would be a good time to remind everyone about the guidelines we set below.\n\nIn terms of sticking to the culture that we set in the guidelines:\n\n> \n> This is the place to talk about any and all things in the gamer cultural space (video games, anime, etc). Mostly, that means stay away from stuff like religion, sex, politics, and social issues, though some exceptions may be appropriate (e.g., internet legislation).\n\nWe should be discussing Remilia as a player and not any social issue beyond that. We know this is a hot topic but this isn&rsquo;t the appropriate place to have those conversations. As we have been doing majority of the day, social issue debates will be removed.","replies":[]}
