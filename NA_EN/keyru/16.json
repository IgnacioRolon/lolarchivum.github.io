You can still report in the [Boards Moderation Discord](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/ZfE311GQ-discord-verification) within the #pbmreports channel, and Arbiters will be able to assist you as available.\r\n\r\nI&rsquo;ll be monitoring this initiative closely over the coming weeks. I strongly encourage you to share feedback you have throughout this process.","replies":[{"poster":"Spideraxe","date":"2017-04-25T01:21:14.246+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm the only the non blue name in this thread so far, send help","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2017-04-25T01:26:05.349+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same, tbh.","replies":[{"poster":"Elduris","date":"2017-04-25T01:52:05.604+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"me_irl","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"jimboman","date":"2017-04-26T13:54:36.499+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm kinda excited for this.
