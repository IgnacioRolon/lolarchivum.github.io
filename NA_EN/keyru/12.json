The last few events I've played it has always been 10 (e.g. Snowdown, Lunar revel/MSI). I mean you can get 30 from one event (so 10 keys), but chances are you will have a load left over like you do, and so won't do that every event (or instead get capsule + 10 key fragments). Last event I got a chroma so am severely lacking in the key department...\nNow you can basically buy capsule + 1 whole key instead of 3.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Keikomatsui ","date":"2019-06-28T21:34:30.753+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":2,"body":"I'm really curious as to why 1) The missions don't include TFT games and 2) why/how TFT isn't considered 'matchmade'\n\nIt seems super scummy and shortsighted to release a brand new shiny gamemode and then make this event that doesn't include support for the new shiny gamemode that everyone wants to play.","replies":[{"poster":"videorfeak","date":"2019-06-30T21:51:59.353+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Keikomatsui ,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=eBazIgqN,comment-id=000a,timestamp=2019-06-28T21:34:30.753+0000)\n>\n> I'm really curious as to why 1) The missions don't include TFT games and 2) why/how TFT isn't considered 'matchmade'\n> \n> It seems super scummy and shortsighted to release a brand new shiny gamemode and then make this event that doesn't include support for the new shiny gamemode that everyone wants to play.\n\n\nLook at what the missions say to do:\n1. Destroy turrets and inhibs: tft doesnt have turrets or inhibs\n2. Kill dragon/baron: Arguably tft has at least dragon although I can see why they wouldnt want to let people cheese the mission in tft for it.\n3. Earn ludicrous amounts of gold: even if tft counted you would never earn enough in tft to do the mission.\n4. Kill insane amounts of minions: again you would never get enough minions in tft.\n5. Vision score: tft does not include wards or vision score\n\nSo its not really tft got excluded, it just doesnt wualify for really any of the missions.\n\nBesides tft is getting its own mission line soon, Riot said a week from launch so this week.","replies":[{"poster":"JW Vincent","date":"2019-07-11T20:52:52.994+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"See, my question in this scenario, isn't \"Why is TFT excluded?\" The better question is, \"Why release TFT at the same time as these missions and not give us some TFT missions or TFT alternative missions?\" As has been done with other game modes and events.
