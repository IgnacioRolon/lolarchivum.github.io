Here is a reminder of qualifications to get your rewards, which should be on accounts by February 25th,  if you do not see it by then, reach out to us in support!\n\n1. You were only chat restricted during the 2018 Season.\n2. You weren't suspended for negative behavior or banned for third-party programs or MMR boosting.\n3. You played all placement matches and placed in the 2018 Season.\n4. Your Honor level is 0 or 1 by the end of the season.\n5. You reached Honor level 2 by February 11, 2019 at 23:59. If you reached Honor level 2 but were punished afterward, you are no longer eligible and won't receive rewards.\n\n---------------\n\nHey everyone,\n\nWe’re making a change to the Honor eligibility for End of Season rewards.\n\nAt the start of this year, we changed the policy for end-of-season rewards to be dependent on your Honor level as opposed to just your recent penalties. Over the last weeks and months, we’ve heard your feedback that it feels rough to be knocked down to Honor 0 or 1 by a chat restriction in the closing days of the season, so we’ll be offering a **_one-time only re-grant of in-game rewards_** in February 2019. Here’s how it works:\n\n> * If you’ve received a **_chat restriction only_** this past season, and are Honor 0 or 1, you will have an opportunity to climb back to Honor 2 by February 11, 2019. If you are Honor 2 at that time, you will get all the rewards you’ve rightfully earned with your blood, sweat and tears.\n> \n> * The above does not apply to any other more severe penalty type, such as 2-week suspensions, botting, boosting, cheating, or permabans. If you’ve received any additional penalties other than just your chat restriction, you won’t be eligible.  \n\nThe climb is possible in that timeframe, and as long as you’re playing to win and not making anyone else’s experience a bad one, you’ll get there quickly just by playing a few games a week. This only applies to your 2018 tier, so even if your rank changes, you’ll receive rewards based on where you ended up in November.\n\n**To be clear:** we will be keeping the Honor eligibility in place for future ranked seasons, and going forward the results of this one-time exception may be helpful if we decide to explore possible tweaks to the to the Honor 0 and 1 experience in the future.\n\nAs always, give us your feedback on this change, and if you’re still climbing out of Honor 0 or 1, we’ll see you in February!\n\n\n**FREQUENTLY ASKED:**\n\n**How do I hit Honor level 2? Do I have enough time?**\n\n> Just be kind to yourself and to others while you're playing League. Even if you start from level 0 and only play a few games a week, you've got more than enough time to hit Honor level 2 by the deadline. There isn't much more information Player Support can provide you other than what is mentioned in THIS article, under \"Reform Period\" and \"Honor Lock\".\n\n\n**I'm so close to Honor level 2, but I got suspended. Can I be eligible for this re-grant?**\n\n> Sorry, this is specific to chat restrictions. If you've been suspended and your behavior's back on track, you'll have no problems being eligible for rewards next year.\n\n\n**Can I transfer servers to restore my honor and get the rewards?**\n\n> No, we'll check your Honor level on the server on which you would've received rewards. So, if you're Gold in Brazil, you'll need to also be Honor level 2 in Brazil by the deadline.\n\n\n**Can I qualify if I receive more than one chat restriction?**\n\n> Yes, you can. Chat restrictions are the lightest punishment you can receive, so as long as you haven't been suspended for other egregious behavior, you're going to have a chance to reform and qualify - no matter how many times you were chat restricted.\n\n\n**Does this mean Honor requirements are gone?**\n\n> No, we'll still have Honor requirements next season. This is a one-time deal.\n\n\n**What does \"punished\" mean exactly?**\n\n> Anything other than a chat restriction that impacted your Honor Level. Examples: 14-day suspensions, boosting or cheating related bans, etc. \n\n\n**Is Riot excusing abusive behavior?**\n\n> We are not. We heard your feedback that it didn't feel great to receive a chat restriction, especially at the end of the season, and being locked out from your end-of-season rewards for the lightest penalty we have. This change is to offer a one-time second chance to players that demonstrate reform from smaller infractions exclusively. The weight of the chat restriction should remain the same (and we won't be lifting any that are warranted), but we felt that the impact it had on your Honor Level and Season Rewards was a little too much in this case.\n\n**I've received a suspension during the pre-season. Do I still qualify?**\n\n> Yes, if the suspension started during the pre-season, you are eligible. We will start reviewing this back when the official 2018 season kicked off. The specific dates are: January 16, 2018, to February 11, 2019.\n\n**I've received a punishment in the 2017 season, but not in 2018 - not even a chat restriction. I just haven't played enough after that penalty, so my Honor level is below 2. Can I get the rewards?**\n\n> No. This initiative is meant to address a very specific reform opportunity related to how Chat Restrictions, Honor and End-of-Season rewards worked together in 2018 only.","replies":[{"poster":"Namîste","date":"2018-11-13T18:38:02.841+0000","up_votes":127,"down_votes":36,"body":"https://media.giphy.com/media/7rj2ZgttvgomY/giphy.gif\n\nI just wanted to say thank you Riot for caring about the player base.","replies":[{"poster":"The Chillin","date":"2018-11-13T19:32:15.318+0000","up_votes":59,"down_votes":4,"body":"Kinda, if they banned inters and griefers by reviewing the games I'd be more happy.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Timbezz","date":"2018-11-13T19:13:52.538+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":26,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Namîste","date":"2018-11-13T19:19:41.384+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":13,"body":"awe your first boards post just to try to frighten me...how cute!\nsorry but I think it's a good idea.

It was deserved. I grinded back to honor 2 + 2 checkpoints in less than 2-3 months. 3 weeks ago, decided to play in normal gameswhen I wasn't having a great day at all (Worst thing to do). Bad news, was easily tilted. Had 2 bad games but with angry premades. So obviously we chat a lot (which Riot doesn't like). And since enemy team will report when 3 guys of the opposite team are begging to report the last guy for \"X\" reason\", RIP Aaaaaand I got a small restriction. Just enough to go back to Honor 1 just at the end of the season.\n\nGuess my season is ruined this year.\n\nAs I read in the comments, I think honor should be linked with the victorious skin but not with the other rewards such as the border or icons. People grinding for months. If they are toxic, they'll get ban, no worries, but they still deserve their rewards. A flaming challenger is still a challenger. Lame but still challenger. It doesn't affect the skill he has.\n\nPeople knows how to make others tilt without chatting. A guy stealing your first buff in the jungle then doing an emote like \"Get f**ked lul\". No risk for him since he's not using chat, but for you ... how not to tilt. The worst thing is when you accept your faith of having a troll, lose the game, start another one and getting with the same guy.\n\nW/e.

If they get punished again, it's going to bite them in the ass. Also, if you do get a chat restriction, generally the same offense will bump you up to a suspension (and loss of rewards).\n\nAccording to what Riot has told us, the majority of people that do something serious enough to get punished don't get punished again. (the complaints on Player Behavior forum are a really small sampling of people who get punished).\n\nAnd frankly, I believe that assertion, particularly amongst players who have put any money into the game- If the account you paid good money for is put  in jeopardy, that usually get's the user's attention.","replies":[{"poster":"rujitra","date":"2018-11-13T23:03:34.877+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"What does a punishment say though if you're able to get punished yet, later on, the punishment isn't the same punishment and is lightened?","replies":[{"poster":"Tahngarthor","date":"2018-11-14T00:13:34.324+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=rujitra,realm=NA,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=TGYs0hwO,comment-id=000400080000,timestamp=2018-11-13T23:03:34.877+0000)\n>\n> What does a punishment say though if you&#x27;re able to get punished yet, later on, the punishment isn&#x27;t the same punishment and is lightened?\n\nThe punishment isn't being lightened. This issue came about because people who got chat restricted later in the season were essentially being punished more than people who got restricted earlier in the season.\n\nWhereas in previous seasons, you were fine as long as you didn't have an active restriction when a certain deadline was hit.\n\nAnd like Riot said, this exception only applies to people whom were issued the lightest punishement the game may dish out. I think this is pretty harmless, and honestly i don't think a simple chat restriction should disqualify you from rewards at all. The timing of your punishment shouldn't be relevant to whether you get your rewards or not anyway.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Kengy","date":"2018-11-13T18:46:05.405+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":4,"body":"I was one of the lucky ones that had a previously permabanned account unbanned.

It has taken me almost year to get to honor level 3. While I appreciate the effort riot is taking to make things right I still question the amount of time it takes to get honor level. I feel redemption with honor level is such a slog and that even with this grace period that riot is giving many people wont even reach it honor level 2. Personally, I feel that Riot needs to re-do the honor system as some things don't make much sense to me. I have played (solo) much more than my friends who started out at honor (2 or 3?) this season and they really only play with other friends and honor each other. My friends have been gaining much more honor than I have. While I understand that honor level gain increases the higher level of honor you have the gain doesn't seem reasonable/proportionate enough at lower levels. Honor Level seems too time based rather than effort based.

I am honor 5 too ( I dont know how, I am not very \" calm tempered \" ) but the thing is, (which most of this community of simple minded teenagers do not seems to fully understand ),  that every single step this company is doing has only single goal: TO CLEAN YOUR WALLET. Only thing that matters is cash flow kid. Toxic players are paying customers too. You do not type shit in game ? Good for you. They type shit ? Good for them. You are not forced to read it. No one is sticking gun to your head reading the chat. Mute all. I am too old to be called idiot by some fucking 13 years old twat, because he is 0/14 and he needs to let his frustration out on someone. Riot is trying to be some fake moralist, element replacing real parents of this scum, mentoring players how to behave.  Well, maybe they should check the quality of their gaming community, which is easily the worst scum I ever experienced in my whole life of playing videogames,  ( and I am older that you think I am ) and then judging and banning people with  some stupid bots. But they did not give a shit. They really do care only about money.","replies":[{"poster":"Glorious Hector","date":"2018-11-14T12:47:27.428+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I do know all of this, thanks for the condescending tone.

I don't get my gold banner as part of rewards? What a joke. I don't want your crappy Orianna skin, or a stupid icon. I played all year and was gold. I get a chat restriction at the end of the season because I am queued with a team of toxic 12 year old males that called me an _ \"e-girl that only plays janna\"_.  Your **auto-chat restrict is garbage**, and you make stupid rules about losing banner with it. Gives no warning, just an immediate chat restriction based off of what your awesome AI? and some reports from other abusive players?  How about instead of punishing your players, you improve your game. What have you really done to make the community better? Punish people? **CLAP CLAP CLAP, GOOD JOB NORTH KOREA, THAT'S VERY CONSTRUCTIVE**. Instead of warning players that they have been recently reported, instead of just automatically applying a filter to swearing, instead of restricting everyone from talking in chat to much (why the hell can people sit on fountain and write a novel), instead of having real people look at reports, instead of  punishing people for false reports, instead of a better ping system so players don't need to type a bunch (take a look at Apex Legends). Riot chooses to hurt their own player base so it can look like they are \"doing something\" about the toxic culture in their game.  I am tired of Riot constantly changing rules, and changing champions, and changing skins I have spent money on.  I play every game through, I don't afk, or get tilted and feed and I try my hardest till the very end.  The feeders, the people that intent games, and literally throw with no punishment And I get punished for talking.... .  You can mute a toxic player, WHAT CAN YOU DO ABOUT A FEEDER. A report on a feeder goes nowhere. My other report last year, was because I supported really good, and my adc didn't want me to help the team. I left her bot after we have over 13 kills (ended with over 20), My team thanked me and I got 3 honors from top jungle and mid, yet received a chat ban because of my insane adc that the entire team muted and laughed at, She sat in all chat telling lies to the enemy team and they reported me ( probably just cause it was funny  how hard we carried and how much she still complained. I literally was chat restricted for saying #supportalllanes, as I helped the rest of my team win the lanes they were struggling in which won us the game. I am so tired of being punished for being a girl in a boys game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rockti","date":"2018-11-16T12:19:45.096+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think this is a fair move from Riot. Everyone should be pleased.\n\nBUT... ... my case is somehow different. \n\nFirst things first: I know i deserve to be punished and I understand the policy of Riot here. I don't want to cry or flame anymore here. I just want to give Riot and \nthe players something to think about.\nPlease take your time and read my comment carefully.\n\nI have been playing League of Legends since season 5 and reached the Goldrank in season 7 (which was a major achievement in my life at a time, a time when college began to be stressful). This season i got better and improved my skills in this game. I began to take wining very serious, it felt not like fun anymore, i just wanted my team and firstly me to win. I quickly reached Gold 3 and aimed with my real life friend towards the Platin Rank. My ambition was to win, so i instantly muted anyone who wanted to disturb me (troll or trash talking). I still used the chat to give my team some advices how to win the game (not the classic \"omg just do this and that\"-guy, no i did this very carefully). I guess that was the reason why i hit honor level 5 nearly two or three months ago. I think I was one of the first players to hit that rank.\n\nHowever, I never got any chat restriction or whatever. But on the one dark, rainy night..  I once had a Katarina in my game (not sure if normal or ranked), which just were unfriendly and trash talked all the way. She clearly did not want to win and began to troll. Normally i would have muted here but i was in Teamspeak with my friend(s?). They (he) were/was very pissed of about her and just couldn't handle this like i do. They/He flamed here etc. etc. This led me to unmute her and to give my friend(s) advices. \nBut holy ... mother ... i was so emotionally involved in this situation and the Katarina exactly know how to trigger me like i never was triggered before, so i fell in sort of a rage mode. I wrote stuff like \"stfu %%%\". For the record, i am not homophobe and I FULLY deserved to be punished. But the way i got punished is questionable. I received a 14 Days Bann, because the abbreviation \"%%%\" is strongly against the policy of Riot and they normally permaban the people. \n\nMy problem here is, that Riot says there are to way of insulting someone:\n   1. One with word x, y, z\n   2. One without the words\nThey say for example to call someone a %%%ot is worse then threatening to kill his family stuff like that multiple times (you will still receive rewards if you received two chat restrictions...). I just don't understand where the line is. I know pretty many people which insult other in game and never got a 14 Day ban. And they were way worse then %%%...\n \nI wish that this could become more transparent, i have to bite in the apple now because i used a specific word, not because i flamed.\n\n\n\n\nPS: Sorry for my bad englisch... \n\nPPS:  Sadly we did not reach platin... but we made major improvements in our skills.","replies":[{"poster":"AsianSwag02","date":"2018-11-17T03:51:26.069+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"riot's banning system is quite interesting... \n1. they RARELY ban streamers because they are good for riot\n2. calling someone toxic can get you a 2 week ban\n3. running it down DOES NOT get you banned atall\nhmmmmmmmmmmm iNtEreStiNg","replies":[]}]}]}
