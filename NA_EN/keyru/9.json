Two of these changes are mostly on our end (more detailed moderation notifications and our intention to hop into more moderation discussions on an ongoing basis), but the third involves topic curation and so may require adjustment for some of you guys.\n \n>**[IMMEDIATE CHANGE]** Institute a blanket policy across all sub-boards, including GD, disallowing conversations regarding religion, race, politics, sex, and social issue topics unrelated to League of Legends (i.e. online legislation is ok, fracking legislation is not). This is an interim step to aid adjustment as we move towards eventual new Universal Rules, sub-board guidelines, and moderation policies as a part of the overall boards updates.\n\nGiven that this policy will affect GD to a greater degree than other boards, we&#039;ve updated the GD guidelines in the sidebar to reflect the change. We&#039;ve also reworded the stated policy a bit to make it clear that all things within and associated with \"gamer culture\" are 100% allowed, rather than just things directly related to League of Legends.\n\nOn another note, as some of you may have noticed we had the mods start taking a stronger stance against low-effort / repetitive posting this week. However, these removals ended up a tad over-zealous and we&#039;ve reassessed things a bit in response to your feedback. The deletion of these types of discussions will be significantly toned down going forward and focused specifically on the *repetitive* aspect of non-constructive or low-effort content.","replies":[]}
