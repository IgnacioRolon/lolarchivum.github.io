Click Here!","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":9,"down_votes":4,"body":"Hey Everyone,\n\nWhoa, such a busy week!  The [World Finals](http://worlds.lolesports.com/en_US/) (RIP NA) is fast approaching, League champions are experiencing [Shadow and Fortune](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/site/shadow-and-fortune/chapter-1.html), and the [Ranked Season is ending in less than 2 weeks](http://bit.ly/1H8vM18)!  To make sure you have as much time as possible to grind out those last few games, follow the steps here if you experience any issues while patching!\n\n-----------------------------------------\n\n> ***Files Scanned reaches over 9000!!!!! Or, 15k, 20k, etc***\n\nThe patcher needs to scanned already installed files to make sure that none of the files are corrupt.  If it finds one, it replaces it and rescans the files.  This is why it can sometimes get as high as 20k, even though there aren't 20k files in the installation.  \n\n**The best thing to do is let it scan files!**  If you restart the client, it may cause it to scan even more files.   The patcher will eventually stop scanning files, and it will patch normally afterward.\n\n> ***Launcher/Patcher never pops up, or disappears after you press \"LAUNCH\"***\n\nThis can be caused by corruption with the patcher itself or it failed to properly self-patch. Additionally, it may be due to some issues with the configuration of your computer system's permissions (meaning it can't properly save the files in the correct location). To resolve this, make sure to complete all the steps in our [Patching Issues Article](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202969434-Patching-Issues)!\n\n\n> ***Patcher stops/errors out at 33%, Patcher fails at 99%, or a general \"Unspecified Error has occurred\" message***\n\nThese are usually connection related errors. Either your computer is unable to maintain a stable connection, or a 3rd party security program is blocking League of Legends from properly patching. Many of the most common Anti-virus programs [have already whitelisted LoL](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues#wq3), however make sure to update yours to the latest version!\n\nAlso, even though you may have set specific exceptions in place before for your security program, League of Legends has gone through a major update. Therefore, your security program may recognize the old version of League of Legends, but not the new version. \n\nTo get these issues resolved ASAP, make sure to go through our [Connection Issues Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues)!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*If after completing these steps, and you still do not see the glorious orange 'LAUNCH' button, feel free to drop us a post in this thread!  Rioters as well as Wrenchmen volunteers will be on hand to respond and provide some additional help!*","replies":[{"poster":"An HD Sandwich","date":"2015-10-30T16:53:18.311+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not sure if this pertains to the patch itself, but it started right after I updated.

The patcher is trying to read certain files in your installation and is being blocked, therefore causing your download speed to plummet to zero.  To rule this out, make sure to complete all of the steps found in our [Permissions Guide.](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions)\n\n2)  There is something blocking your connection from getting the necessary files.
