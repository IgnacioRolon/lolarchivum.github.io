I received a 2 week suspension for \"toxicity\". Tell me how this works. It is almost like Riot is just going off of how many people report you instead of the situation and what the other person said as well. It is not right. You could be playing norms and have a whole team full of people that are friends. This is my situation- I played draft- I called adc this other person calls support. Sounds fine? Then we get into the game and he takes every single bit of farm I have and builds damage as a support. So I refused to go the lane with him. How am I supposed to play adc and do well if I cant get any farm or kills? Should I be subjected to build a gold item as an adc because this guy didn't follow the rules of the game? Then because they are all friends I get reported by all of them and get banned. It is absolutely ridiculous. Riot doesn't care about the situation they don't take the time to read into it. They just take your chat logs and the number of reports and call it a day. I think the system needs a huge fix. Why have a mute button if people don't use it? Why not focus more intent on the intentional feeders. I never see them get banned???? It is obsurd. You should have to be 18 years or older to play the game because the game is exactly like games such as call of duty. People talk bad about each other all the time to get hyped. That is the reason there is a mute button so people don't have to let it affect their game play. Simple. I don't understand why Riot is so harsh and not focusing their needs on the feeders. The people who REALLY ruin the game for others.","replies":[{"poster":"RHiN0X","date":"2016-06-10T23:18:32.237+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":1,"body":"What's even worse is how the actual abuser teams up to report a user as a team and reports a person who is not the problem and that person gets the ban.... while the actual rude team gets off with nothing.

There is nothing i can do other than try to find another pick in time after the intial shock of my pick being intentionally banned by my teammate, which resulted in the lock in timer running out and me recieving leaver buster for not locking in.

If anyone believes that a post should be reviewed by a moderator, by all means report it and we'll review it.\n\nThat being said, just because you don't like something someone says to you on an online forum doesn't make it offensive by our guidelines.  You're not going to always agree with everyone online and you shouldn't.  Healthy debate is a positive thing.  If someone tries to derail that debate pointlessly, then as Daen previously commented, the community itself can handle most negative, troll commentary on its own by either ignoring it or downvoting it.\n\nThe moderation staff will continue to step in if someone crosses the line into truly abusive or toxic commentary.","replies":[{"poster":"Disneylord","date":"2015-11-30T07:38:40.038+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Mod Curator","date":"2015-11-30T20:06:38.769+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Disneylord,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=J9LLBvJz,comment-id=00090000000000000000000000000000000000000001,timestamp=2015-11-30T07:38:40.038+0000)\n>\n> TheCurator can you answer me please, if an account is banned on boards and you swap summoner names with your other acc and post do you get banned in the second acc too?\n\nIf your primary Boards account has been permanently suspended and you post on another account, that account will also be permanently suspended as ban evasion is not allowed on the Boards.
