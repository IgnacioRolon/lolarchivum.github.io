The main functionality for this channel is to help have direct communication to moderators on the Boards regarding discussions/posts that break our Universal Rules. We&rsquo;ll still be actioning normally if reported through the existing reporting method but this gives an extended avenue that players can use if they would like to give a more detailed report.\n\nWe&rsquo;ll need you to register first in our Discord verification thread [here](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/ZfE311GQ-discord-verification) and the moderators will get you setup in our channel. When you want to report, head over to #pbmreports and use @moderators ONLY and a moderator will pull you into their room to discuss the report privately. Do note that this feature is a privilege and access will be removed if abused.","replies":[{"poster":"Best Kog NA","date":"2016-12-13T23:38:33.571+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"So would this be used for just basic \"Incorrect board\" reports or would it be for more \"Somebody's spamming the same topic 50 bazzillion times\" type of reports?

Feeders make game less enjoyable for others, but not on purpose; flfamers have a choice.\n\nThere is also a big strategic issue when it comes to ragers; in my experience, they make more winnable games lost, than the feeders because of giving up too early. \n\nIn the late game, when everyone is on full build, K/D/A does not matter. Things that matter are elemental dragons and towers that are still standing. So if you get there (it may not happen every game, but it does happen), a feeder is no longer this big of a problem. A flamer, who brings team's morale down however, is.  \n\nAlso, the ragers tend to give up faster; and calling open mid and just sitting in base, or saying ff@20 and starting surrender vote every three minutes since 20 minute mark is one of the worst things you can do in my opinion. \n\nEven leavers don't get on my nerves this much. \nI have won some 4v5 games.\nI have never won a game in which my team outvoted me in a surrender vote.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Ada Wong","date":"2016-12-17T22:51:33.319+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So what is this for exactly?
