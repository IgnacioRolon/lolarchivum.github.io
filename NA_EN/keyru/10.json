This has been a pain point for some board users and we'd like to test to shift it back to this old style.\n\n~~We're planning to start by disabling Discussion View across all boards on 2/27. Comments will now be visible in the order they were posted rather than by popularity, and the reply button will now automatically quote the comment you are replying to so that the conversation can still be clearly followed. We do expect that this may take a bit of getting used to from those of you more familiar with the Reddit format, but we feel it’s a change that the community has been seeking.~~\n\nWe’re currently discussing whether or not we’ll be rolling out changes to the upvote and downvote system, so stay tuned for more information.\n\nAs a quick reminder, there are limitations to what we can change within the Boards which must already be developed. Any suggestions outside this scope, we will look into but cannot guarantee if it has to be developed and not already existent within the means of the platform.\n\nOutside of that, let me and the Volunteer team know your thoughts~ I'll be monitoring this discussion.\n\n-- Keyru &amp; The Volunteer Team","replies":[{"poster":"Keyru","date":"2019-02-26T18:43:04.382+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hot is back to the front page and we're not going to be removing Discussion view.

If e.g. 20 people see a thread and realize it's a thoughtless rant, right now they can downvote it to indicate that they don't believe thoughtless rants are a good contribution. Without downvoting, that thread stays at the default +1, along with threads those 20 people haven't even seen.

I can understand making chrono the _default_ as it helps make new members of the boards grow used to the old style, but there is no need to completely delete a view that myself and many other boards users use.  \n\nI have 0 interest in chronological view, as in 0.  I would only ever use it on the Roleplay boards if it wasn't already forced on GD, and half the time I only end up reading the first few comments on any GD post because I don't want to have to scroll through a ton of in between comments to put together a discussion.  \n\nTo me Chrono is the least intuitive view because I am forced to find the last comment in a chain, then keep jumping back through the quotes so I can read everything, then reorder it in my head.  Then do that for every interesting comment chain in the post.  Frankly I would post and interact more on GD if it had Discussion view, but as it is I post there maybe once a month at maximum.\n\nIf you remove Discussion view from the boards I am probably just going to leave.  I love this community, hell I was part of the first moderator wave because I enjoy working with everyone here.  Even though I barely play the game anymore I still come here to see what everyone is up to.  However if discussion view is removed I just can't.  I wish I could stay, but I already know based on GD how much it will bug me, and I will just slowly feel pushed away and alienated by a format that I can't stand.\n\nI don't exactly enjoy LoL Reddit or ever visit it but I guess I will try moving there.  I just can't enjoy reading chronologically ordered forums, to the point where I will read 3-4 comments in a chrono view compared to reading every comment in a large thread in discussion.\n\nAs a former mod I fail to see how cutting off a large section of the community helps build a community.

In fact the more people that use chrono the better, for most of the reasons you stated.  That doesn't change the fact that there are people out there _who don't like chrono_, and frankly the boards has been using discussion view for so long now that a large section of us have grown attached to it.\n\nI like chrono for a couple reasons: It helps shove many unhelpful/clutter posts down to the bottom, and when it does raise them up it shows where a community stands on a certain subject.\n\nIt also makes threads that contain multiple lines of discussion far far far easier to follow.  I can see what someone said, and the various lines of argument that branch off of that.  I can have two different people respond to a comment with individual concerns and follow up with each of them individually; and anyone else reading can easily distinguish between the two, or easily scroll down past my entire comment tree if they aren't interested in that particular section.\n\nOn big threads it really helps organize things in a way that chrono just can't, and that _I_ can't.  Because I can't follow multiple different discussions in chrono.  I do actually have to find the last comment in any particular chain and follow the quotes all the way back through; and god forbid if there are multiple interesting comment chains in a chrono post, or that they are being added to.\n\nI like to think I am a fairly intelligent person, but chrono view just doesn't work for me.  That style of organization is not how I think; and I will never be able enjoy my interactions with the community in an environment where I have to use it.\n\nI know that I personally will read the small ignored comments in discussion threads because they are organized in a way that makes it clear they are stand alone comments, and not part of some larger comment tree I am missing.\n\n----------------------------\n\nI know the view has its flaws.  I will never deny that.  I also think that chrono is healthier for a forum.  However neither of those points change the fact that removing discussion view will alienate a large chunk of this community because it is the view that we want to use.  Discussion view has been around for so long now that it is a very real and integral part of the boards and the community that uses it.  Cutting that out means cutting out a large part of the community.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"I love cowboys","date":"2019-02-25T21:33:32.623+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":4,"body":"Thank you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Velzard of Koz","date":"2019-02-25T23:20:08.282+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have you considered keeping Discussion View on Boards that don't need this form of constructivity like Memes and Games?\n\nI feel like DV has its value and don't like losing it.

Comments will now be visible in the order they were posted rather than by popularity, and the reply button will now automatically quote the comment you are replying to so that the conversation can still be clearly followed.

Personally I'd love graphical improvements to the profile page.\n\nI love how the \"comments\" and \"discussions\" views in profiles are ordinary, separate pages. This is the sort of thing that doesn't need to be a \"tabbed\" view that swaps page content instead of simply going to a new page, and \"buttons\" are just styling anyway. I would also love to have a better way of searching through my previous posts than scrolling to the bottom to load more results over and over again until the page is huge and slow. And if I ever browse away, that effort is lost and I have to \"dig\" again. Don't make me dig. Just produce separate pages of results, like an ordinary Google search does. That way I can jump ahead quickly, go to the \"last\" page (my first posts), or manually type in the URL of the page I want to see. Or how about being able to export and download our post history as a text file?\n\nI like practical tools. As far as \"slick and modern,\" I either don't care about it (when it's unobtrusive) or hate it (when it interferes with usability, like Boards profiles or the official match history site).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Risk of Fate","date":"2019-02-25T22:00:04.160+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Attysu The Poro","date":"2019-02-25T22:15:07.908+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"It could be!
