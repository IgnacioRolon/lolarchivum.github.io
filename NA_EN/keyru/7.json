We&rsquo;re open to looking into some of the points listed (as per my original comment) and here&rsquo;s some changes moving forward. We&rsquo;ll be in testing phase for the changes below which are subject to revert back to the original if not deemed successful.\n____\n\n> **POLITICS AND CURRENT EVENTS**\n\nThe Guidelines for this sub-board has been changed to the below allowing the posting of politics and current events within this space. The moderators will be carefully monitoring discussions and posts regarding these subjects and any offenses past these will be more severe.\n\n_**Culture**_\n\n_This is the place to talk about any and all things in the gamer cultural space (video games, anime, etc). Mostly, that means stay away from stuff like religion, sex, and social issues. Politics and current events are allowed as long as the discussion remains civil._\n____\n\n> **UPVOTE/DOWNVOTE**\n\nThere&rsquo;s a restriction in how much we can change with this but I have turned it off for the time being which only targets **discussion** upvoting or downvoting. This feature is still useable within comments of a discussion. This is subject to change debating on the general feedback during the testing phase from the community.\n___\n\n> **LEVEL RESTRICTIONS**\n\nThe level restriction has been lowered to 15 for posting discussions, comments, and comment voting. This is possible to change depending on how moderators feel they are being pressured in removing banned smurfs.\n___\n\n> **CLEAN SLATE 2.0**\n\nPer a case by case basis, permanently suspended players can write in a support ticket to me and I&rsquo;ll review them with moderators to determine if their account can have their permanent suspension revoked. Keep in mind that only the main account will be unsuspended and smurfs will remain permanently suspended. Past posters which were severe offenders will still remain permanently suspended within the Boards.","replies":[]}
