The main functionality for this channel is to help have direct communication to moderators on the Boards regarding discussions/posts that break our Universal Rules. We’ll still be actioning normally if reported through the existing reporting method but this gives an extended avenue that players can use if they would like to give a more detailed report.\n\nWe’ll need you to register first in our Discord verification thread [here](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/9RBNln7l-discord-verification) and the moderators will get you setup in our channel. When you want to report, head over to #miscreports respectively and use @moderators ONLY and a moderator will pull you into their room to discuss the report privately. Do note that this feature is a privilege and access will be removed if abused.","replies":[{"poster":"Eternal Torment","date":"2017-06-17T08:22:03.716+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I want to verify that i have joined discord, but i am unable to comment on the verification thread","replies":[]},{"poster":"R31W1NG","date":"2017-03-14T07:08:40.141+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like how the rules include \"Always be respectful to Moderators and Rioters. Harassment and insults will not be tolerated\" when Rioters have a habit of not even actually reading posts they delete.  Perhaps something appropriate such as \"flaming will not be tolerated.\"  Respect is a two way street and in general Riot [and the player base] doesn't have it.","replies":[]}]}
