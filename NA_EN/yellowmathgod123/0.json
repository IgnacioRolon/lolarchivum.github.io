Then I tried to login again after awhile and I typed in the correct username and password but it got stuck in the authenticating part. It says Authenticating.... and nothing more, I waited like 15 minutes then gave up and thought that it was a temporarily problem so I waited to the next day but it didn't work today either. Why can't I log in and how do I fix this?","replies":[{"poster":"mee7o","date":"2018-02-07T03:47:25.765+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"this is happening to me right now at this very moment, so annoying...........","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-02-03T19:25:02.678+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"You may be having a network issue reaching our authentication servers, so it can't accept anything you submit.
