Then another chat restriction maybe a week ago that which wasn't justified, except for the fact that I was \"toxic before\".  I'm sure people will use the same justification for this one.  I get one chat restriction on my account and now if I say anything in game and get reported they justify it by the previous reports.  Then it just cycles up until I either get perma banned or don't use chat at all.\n\nHere's the chat log for my chat restriction: \n\nGame 3238195875:\nFireDrogen: theyre going to my red\nFireDrogen: or that\nFireDrogen: why are you being a dick\nFireDrogen: whats your problem?\nFireDrogen: seriuosly?\nFireDrogen: youre such a mean person\nFireDrogen: who hurt you people\nFireDrogen: its 4 kills\nFireDrogen: might as well be running a daycare\nFireDrogen: rather than playing this game\nFireDrogen: fucks sake\nFireDrogen: theyre gonna dive\nFireDrogen: lol\nFireDrogen: i literally just gave you a kill\nFireDrogen: you got ganked 1v1\nFireDrogen: while i was clearing jg\nFireDrogen: you had no ward\nFireDrogen: youre just blaming me for random shit\nFireDrogen: worry about yourself\n[All]FireDrogen: dont listen to her shes been blaming me all game long\n[All]FireDrogen: for what lol\n[All]FireDrogen: shes trying to 1v1 the fed brand\n[All]FireDrogen: i gave her a kill\n[All]FireDrogen: thank christ\n[All]FireDrogen: someone reasonable\n[All]FireDrogen: like yeah i got invaded but im literally doing fine lmfao\nFireDrogen: literally nothing i could have done there\nFireDrogen: where were u bud?\nFireDrogen: lol\nFireDrogen: youre complaining bc youre projecting\n[All]FireDrogen: karma toxic af too\n[All]FireDrogen: theyre both just ganging up on me saying whole game is my fault lol\n[All]FireDrogen: like even if i dont gank ur lane going 1/10 isnt excusable lmfao\n[All]FireDrogen: and i tried to gank too lo l\n[All]FireDrogen: lol i missed smite once thats why youve been flamimg me for nearly 20 mins?\n[All]FireDrogen: i accidently put MYSEFL behind and youre throwing a hissy fit\n[All]FireDrogen: doesnt effect you at all\n[All]FireDrogen: karma legit just watching me die\nFireDrogen: diana ju st shut up\nFireDrogen: no\nFireDrogen: just him\n\nThose are the only 2 games on the recent reform cards I've received.  TWO games.  Out of my hundreds of games played, two games where, not only was I not toxic, I was actually being flamed by my whole team from the start of the game.  Those two games were picked up by the system and deemed me too toxic to be allowed to play.","replies":[{"poster":"rujitra","date":"2019-12-31T02:41:31.389+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yes, people will.

Seems like a pretty normal thing to say to somebody that is being a complete dickwad.  And although I said ff15 go next, I still played the game out.   You're telling me that if I play like 50 games with no problems after my chat restriction, but then in one game suggest in chat that we should forfeit, that is bad enough behavior to deserve a 14 day ban?

Context of the chat should matter, especially in cases like this, and the severity of the punishment shouldn't just arbitrarily ramp up like this.  I'd argue that a player who gets upset with their teammates 1 in every 50 games isn't unacceptable, but HUMAN.  In fact, I might even argue that somebody like that is a fucking saint.  This game is incredibly frustrating, just like any game.  Getting frustrated when things go poorly in something that is relatively high stakes and takes a lot of time to accomplish is completely reasonable, and punishing people for losing their cool a little bit is just the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard of.  I never personally attack anybody, I never say anything particularly obscene or inappropriate to my teammates.  Pretty much everything I say is justified within the context of the game, and literally the only reason you're saying I deserve it is because I got a little upset.  I mean I've had people literally call me racial slurs in game.  There are definitely cases where players should definitely be banned from playing, but arguing with your teammates every once in a while shouldn't be one of them.","replies":[{"poster":"rujitra","date":"2019-12-31T03:26:11.799+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You are free to have that opinion.\n\nOver 80% of players never get a single chat restriction.

Tons of accounts are botted, inactive, or only play normals/arams/special gamemodes.  Give me a statistic for the % of players with chat restrictions that have 50+ ranked games in season 9.
