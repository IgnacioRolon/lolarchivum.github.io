This also happened with 2 of my other teammates and at the end of a 16 minute game, we didn't even receive a \"Loss prevented\" and one even received a Leaverbuster. How can that happen when Riot decided to let him load in the *LAST 2 MINUTES*. The enemy team was even** extremely hostile** when we tried to discuss this with them .

Is the game generating a R3D log? (article on how to get that [HERE](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752674-Network-System-and-League-of-Legends-Logs#section-windows) ) If so, please link it here in this thread! If not, letting us know that also helps.\n\n2. Is the crash giving you the \"bugsplat\" popup? If so, make sure you press submit for that crash report! If not, let us know.\n\n3. Some folks have suggested that deleting your Config folder that lives in C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\ solves the problem. (Warning: this will delete all your in-game settings). If that works...also let us know!\n\n4. The last steps are using the repair function, or re-installing League of Legends, if all else is failing. \n\nBonus note: If you're trying any of the above solutions, please test out a custom game afterwards to see if it worked before queueing with other folks!","replies":[{"poster":"MikeyyB","date":"2015-02-27T15:13:46.023+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"000000.000|       0.0000kb|      0.0000kb added| ALWAYS| Logging started at 2015-02-27T15:04:24.177\n000000.000|       0.0000kb|      0.0000kb added| ALWAYS| Loading RADS dynamic library: C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\RADS\\RiotRadsIO.dll\n000000.031|       0.0000kb|      0.0000kb added|   OKAY| Riot::RADS::Reader::RadsExportsMain::Initialize: RADS library initializing with specified working directory \"C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\RADS\\solutions\\lol_game_client_sln\\releases\\0.0.1.79\\deploy\".\n000000.032|       0.0000kb|      0.0000kb added|   OKAY| Riot::RADS::Reader::RuntimeEnvironment::Create: Creating RADS runtime environment: RADS root directory = \"C:/Riot Games/League of Legends/RADS\"\n000000.032|       0.0000kb|      0.0000kb added|   OKAY| Riot::RADS::Reader::SolutionManifest::Load: (\"C:/Riot Games/League of Legends/RADS/solutions/lol_game_client_sln/releases/0.0.1.79/solutionmanifest\")\n000000.032|       0.0000kb|      0.0000kb added|   OKAY| Riot::RADS::Reader::ConfigurationManifest::Load: (\"C:/Riot Games/League of Legends/RADS/solutions/lol_game_client_sln/releases/0.0.1.79/configurationmanifest\")\n000000.032|       0.0000kb|      0.0000kb added|   OKAY| Riot::RADS::Reader::ReleaseManifest::LoadInternal: (\"C:/Riot Games/League of Legends/RADS/projects/lol_game_client_en_gb/releases/0.0.0.247/releasemanifest\")\n000000.141|       0.0000kb|      0.0000kb added|   OKAY| Riot::RADS::Reader::ReleaseManifest::LoadInternal: (\"C:/Riot Games/League of Legends/RADS/projects/lol_game_client/releases/0.0.1.19/releasemanifest\")\n000000.771|       0.0000kb|      0.0000kb added| ALWAYS| Loaded RADS dynamic library: C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\RADS\\RiotRadsIO.dll\n000000.817|       0.0000kb|      0.0000kb added|   OKAY| Unable to process data overlay file ./ToolsConfig.xml, defaulting to overlay now\n000000.817|       0.0000kb|      0.0000kb added| ALWAYS| Data overlay start folder initialized to DATA, Content/Src\n000000.818|       0.0000kb|      0.0000kb added| ALWAYS| Global logging level set to   WARN\n000000.818|       0.0000kb|      0.0000kb added| ALWAYS| Build Version: Version 5.4.0.241 (Feb 19 2015/20:20:00) [PUBLIC]  ChangeList: 901358\n000001.000|       0.0000kb|      0.0000kb added| ALWAYS| Started System Init\n000001.001|       0.0000kb|      0.0000kb added| ALWAYS| Maestro Init\n000001.232|       0.0000kb|      0.0000kb added| ALWAYS| Maestro completed init\n000001.232|       0.0000kb|      0.0000kb added| ALWAYS| zip manifest, 'ClientZips.txt', not found (expected).\n000001.249|       0.0000kb|      0.0000kb added| ALWAYS| StartSession called\n000001.249|       0.0000kb|      0.0000kb added| ALWAYS| Started Init event arguments\n000001.250|       0.0000kb|      0.0000kb added| ALWAYS| Waiting until connection...\n000001.532|       0.0000kb|      0.0000kb added| ALWAYS| InitRenderer() enter\n000001.532|       0.0000kb|      0.0000kb added| ALWAYS| r3dRenderLayer::Init(0x0021010a) enter\n000001.551|       0.0000kb|      0.0000kb added| ALWAYS| r3dRenderLayer::Init() exit successfully\n000001.759|       0.0000kb|      0.0000kb added| ALWAYS| Loaded locale en_GB via fontconfig\n000001.765|       0.0000kb|      0.0000kb added| ALWAYS| IME file, 'C:/Riot Games/League of Legends/RADS/solutions/lol_game_client_sln/releases/0.0.1.79/deploy/Data/Menu/IMEConfig.xml', is optional.

Happened before, randomly, now its every single time.  But whats even more infuriating? You, Riot, punish my account and lower my priority in queues because Your poor programming caused the issues that have made me \"leave\" 5+ games.  Because I tried all your wonderful useless ideas, and tried a game each time.  Oh and Ive put a decent amount of money into your game, so dont tell me it is because the game is free and blah blah. Useless excuses.  Please fix this today.  I'd estimate you have around 24 hours before I perma-uninstall. Because this is absurd.","replies":[]},{"poster":"dreamt13","date":"2015-02-26T08:42:55.339+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I'm having a lag issue.
