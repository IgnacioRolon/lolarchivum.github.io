Ive enjoyed up until now. You guys are terrible at balancing champions from damage to ap/ad ratios. The tank meta is completely fucked right now and unfair the amount of dmg a 3000 health tank can put out per second. Examples: Garen, Daruis, Maokai, etc.I hate how controlling you guys are of the meta and how you base it around the scrubs in the LCS. You guys have to be blind if you dont notice the cancer damage some characters pump out per second and are one shoting people lvl 6. I would love to sit and talk with one of your creators and show him the cancer that i get everygame i play. You guys need to incorparate more bans for us and not just for pro play, there is WAY to many op champs right now for there not to be more then 3. I try to stop and play league everyday but league is like cancer it never goes away. I hope you took the time to actually read this, and if you did than i appreciate it becasue at riot i feel like you guys dont listen to the fans, and we make your game, we make your company the billions of dollars u make. And whoever made yasuo should be fire just saying :). Thanks and have a good day! Im gonna go play more league and brake more shit becasue of the unbalnced game you have made.","replies":[{"poster":"Christhefer","date":"2017-01-18T23:19:38.672+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for opening my eyes to a different point of view of this game. I can see the stance you are coming from. For instance, 6 bans is not enough for the amount of champions in this game. Also, I feel true damage should not be in the game. {{champion:122}} {{champion:86}} {{champion:67}} to name some can be very strong, if not broken in certain situations. I agree with you. Others should leave their opinions below.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TonkpilS47","date":"2017-01-19T16:44:42.990+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I play AD Garen and carry every game xD.But siriously I get S+every game.","replies":[{"poster":"Betard Hands","date":"2017-01-20T04:31:57.754+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's why this game is broken and the meta is fucked up\n","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-01-18T23:25:32.136+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is why riot has added more bans, 10 total, to be exact. \nGaren is considered underpowered; low elo problems.","replies":[]}]}
