The shield is not OP.  Unfortunately a lot of bad players simply don't know how to play against it.  \n\n* At level 1 the shield has a 23 second CD.  So if your CC is reliable at all then blackshield is not dependable.  You bait the shield and then blow her up.  \n\n* The shield's magic damage reduction is actually ass, and she's basically hard countered by all burst AD assassins.   (Btw that's the current meta).   Using the shield to survive a massive magic damage attack simply doesn't work unless you maxed the shield or its super early game.  \n\n* Instant cast CC hard counters black shield.  Let's take alistar knock up for example.  If alistar moves toward my ADC I could blackshield him.  If I do then a good Alistar will not use his charge and wait until BS is on cooldown.  Now my adc is defenseless.  So pre-blackshielding only works against bad alistars.  Instead, you will have to shield after the alistar dash and before the knock up.  This means alistar still gets his initiation off.   \n\n* Morgana  somewhat counters slow high telegraphed CC such as Rakan dash, blitz hook, pyke hook.  YOU MEAN THE TOP PICKS HAVE COUNTER PLAY EVERY 23 SECONDS? OH NO.  Do you even understand how overpowered and disgusting Rakan and Pyke are as champions?  Dash Dash Dash Dash Stealth Regend Dash Dash Dash Dash Dash Dash Dash Charm Dash Dash Dash Dash Dash Dash Dash.   \n\nTruthfully, Morgana is a pretty middle of the road support.  Her damage is mid/high for a support.  Her CC is high for a support.  Her lane sustain is terrible for a support.  The only reason she's a competitive pick is because she saves people from brain dead double dive bot lane which is more of a product of the adc nerf than it is of Morgana's innate abilities.  \n\nLet's also not even get into how unreliable Morgana's Q really is.  You will NEVER land a max range hit on this ability against an equally skilled opponent.  It has the third slowest projectile speed in the game.  If you let her walk up to you then she will hit it.  Yes, let the champion with no mobility walk right up to you.  That's something that happens often in high level play right?  \n\nThe real benefit of Q is it is a dive-deterrent.  People will think twice about going all in versus it.  Oh, but if you miss it you're utterly, utterly fucked.  \n\nLet's not even get into how unrewarding Morgana is as a mid given she's a mage and not an enchanter.  \n\nMy advice is just to practice more. I have about 5000 games played as Morgana over eight years.  I've played it in every lane and against every match up.

The problem I have with her is how effective she is at the end game. If I'm trying to take out an adc as Vi it becomes basically impossible until the shield goes down. It's up 5 out of every 9 seconds with max CD at rank 5. Combine that with her Q and R it becomes absurdly hard to take down a strong adc without a concerted effort of a whole team. I'm not saying she's broken, but she is the support I am most worried about for about half my jungle picks.","replies":[{"poster":"Morgana Ultima","date":"2018-07-20T18:43:46.559+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fair enough.  At max rank it is about an 8 second CD with max CDR.   However, it only targets one person.  Meanwhile you have Taric ult......\n\nThe one place black shield becomes unfair is on somebody like master yi late game.  In fact, I just played a match where the master yi and I could easily 2 v 5 because you just can't kill a master yi with BS.  \n\nMy counter argument would be that perhaps Riot should balance the game so that one person isn't that absurdly, and utterly ridiculously powerful.  The fact Master yi has the damage output to kill entire teams in under 15 seconds is the real issue. \n\nAnyway, you can definitely still kill the enemy adc if they have a morgana.  Morgana is helpless against the kings of balance known as Zed and Talon.  Your adc will just get deleted regardless of any shield they have.  \n\nOne final note about Morgana.  This champion's win rate drops hard as fuck as the game goes on longer.  https://champion.gg/champion/morgana/Support?\n\nYou're complaining about late game, but her late game win rate is sub 50%.  You actually want to get to late game against her because her damage doesn't scale well into late.  The fact you can't get into late game right now is once again Riot's fault.  Maybe League games shouldn't be ending at 25 minutes on average in a game where for 8 years the average game length was 35 minutes.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DameioNaruto","date":"2019-08-02T06:59:28.571+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Morgana Ultima,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=sWYpMroM,comment-id=0008,timestamp=2018-07-20T07:51:45.105+0000)\n>\n> I've mained Morgana for 8 years.
