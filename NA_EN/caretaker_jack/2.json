You're not stupid, it's how we label things across the world and can be confusing!  Each year, there are 2 splits.  In LCS, they are called Spring and Summer.  We have events in there too that are not part of the split itself, so it looks something like this:\n\nSpring Split games -> MSI (not a split) -> Summer Split (weeks 1-4) -> Rift Rivals (not a split) -> Summer Split (weeks 5-10) -> Worlds (not a split) -> All Stars (not a split).","replies":[{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2019-07-09T18:06:14.438+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot 5oda,realm=NA,application-id=9hBQwnEU,discussion-id=qncdM2Jh,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2019-07-09T15:23:32.339+0000)Spring Split games -> MSI (not a split) -> Summer Split (weeks 1-4) -> Rift Rivals (not a split) -> Summer Split (weeks 5-10) -> Worlds (not a split) -> All Stars (not a split).\n\nGiven this, is it possible we could get some sort of highlight on videos that will give us credit for games watched? I often find myself having to guess!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Caretaker Jack","date":"2019-07-09T17:44:52.833+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah, so it really is ongoing, haha...
