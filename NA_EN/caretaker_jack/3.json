Even if the more recent work has been taking it to be about stuff I don’t care about. \n\nDemacia has all the trappings of a setting I want to see explored. The only problem is so far it isn’t interesting. I want to read about soldiers, knights, economic struggles, and war. Instead they've mostly focused on Lux and how bad mages are treated. And I don’t really care.  It’s not helped by the fact that J4 is probably the least interesting leader character in the game. When compared to Swain, Azir, Gangplank/MF, and the 3 Queens the only thing I can say about J4 is that he has a dragon girlfriend. So... good for him, I guess.","replies":[{"poster":"AliParvaz","date":"2018-09-10T04:41:50.756+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Shyv and J4 is not even really canon. His new version has the problem of lack of characterization. I saw something TBSkyen pointed is that Jarvan who grew up all his life in this anti-magic racist society suddenly trusts Shyvana out of nowhere and that instead of trying to go more into that they gloss over it in favour of world building and tying it to Shyvana’s lore. He also brings up the problem we never get to know Jarvan as a person or character. The last problem pointed out that I agree with is a contradiction in his motivation. We’re told at the start the reason why he decided to attack the Noxians even though it was unwise to do so was because of the tragedies he saw happen to his people. Then at the end they say Jarvan learned unity instead of thinking wars was about victory and gloriousness but at the beginning the reason he attacked the Noxian wasn’t out of pride or his reputation but because he got sad over what happened to his people. So which one is it suppose to be? Is it suppose to be “Oh God what will they think about me at home for losing! I can’t go back to Demacia like this! They’ll mock me! I must win at all cost as victory is what matters!” Or “Oh God look at all the bloodshed the vile Noxian caused and the poor people who suffered! I have to avenge them and make Noxians pay!” These two are very different characters.\n\nI suggest everyone to watch TBSkyen lore videos, they are so good at seeing specific problems and specific reasons why a short story is so well-written.","replies":[{"poster":"Whyte Lyon","date":"2018-09-10T05:09:20.227+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Gloss over\" isn't exactly how I would describe J4 and Shyv's relationship being represented in-lore. The fault for this perception of it being rushed lies more on the restrictions all Biographies have. The biggest thing being Bio's have a third-person narration to them, which is godawful for conveying and contextualizing emotional scenarios or any part of a character's internal thoughts/struggles. If J4 and Shyv's potential partnership (romantic or not) was to ever be told, the Biography wouldn't be the most advantageous place to do that. But Bio's can be used to establish it, which is exactly what the writers did.","replies":[{"poster":"AliParvaz","date":"2018-09-10T05:18:26.922+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"But it is glossed over.

Although both of the two characters did get the advantage of overlapping backstory, yet each still originated from wildly different backgrounds, where the writer has to fill that word count by juggling all the aspects of their 'origins' into a short catalog structured story. At the same time pushing the other plotline that gets the two characters teaming up in a sufficiently explained, sufficiently detailed and sufficiently satisfying story all in an individual Bio of about 10-13 paragraphs. \n\nI think they did it as lucrative a job as they could possibly do under such conditions.

There is also a problem of a literal contradiction in the little character he was shown to have. How can you defend this?
