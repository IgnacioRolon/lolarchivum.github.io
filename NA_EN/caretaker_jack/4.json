Why exactly is the 80 health game so game breaking that were willing to slow down our builds? Don't you technically get more health out of 3 pots? \r\n\r\nI'm aware I must sound crazy.. but im tried of not understanding why we do what we do in this game.","replies":[{"poster":"Midg3t","date":"2019-08-27T00:10:31.188+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"80 hp at early lvls can make a difference between life and death.

If you dont benefit from all 3, you probably are best starting off with long sword.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BlackKnightJack","date":"2019-08-27T01:02:26.315+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Harder to burst down plus you get a little bit of life steal as sustain.
