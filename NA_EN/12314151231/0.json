Sure\r\n there&#039;re summoners with names like &quot;archu6&quot; but even those can be a mix of two pokemon or something.\r\n\r\nMy name comes from Abracadabra, if you look up the word there&#039;s a charm that uses an anagram of the word. It&#039;s actually a pretty cool word in that respect. &quot;Abracadabra&quot; means &quot;I create as I speak. &quot;Avada kedavra&quot; means I destroy as I speak. Why the numbers? Well since the anagram didn&#039;t really focus on letters, I thought it could be substituted for numbers for every abstract or different character. So 12314151231 was born lol\r\n\r\nThat doesn&#039;t stop people from thinking its a phone number!\r\nWhere&#039;d you get your name?","replies":[]}
