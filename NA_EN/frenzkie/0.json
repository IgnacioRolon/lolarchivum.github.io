I am playing against people way better than me. For example, I just played a game of Soraka support against, a Platinum IV Jinx, a Silver III Nami, and a Gold V Zed. I AM LEVEL TWENTY FIVE!!!!!! I just have to say that games of league are not fun when you get crushed by people who have way more experience than you. It feels unfair and makes the game terrible for low level players like me. I just thought I'd post my thought on this, as well as ask if there is anything I can do to be placed with people in my skill level.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-06T22:33:10.773+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh man, yea that can be hella frustrating sometimes I know that as well. Normal Matches don't take rank into consideration at all, since they aren't actually ranked matches. With that being said, I believe it does still try to balance the two teams MMR as best it can. It may not seem like it, but keep in mind your Rank doesn't necessarily equal your MMR.\n\nYou're pretty close to level 30, so you aren't far off from ranked! It sounds like you may have a much better time enjoying your matches once you get there, so best of luck and not too long now!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Navillus","date":"2017-08-06T18:42:03.815+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yea norms are well norms. you can get placed with what seams with anyone in \"lower\" elos even if your under 30. it seams to be more rare tbh but i could be wrong. just deal with it and you can do it! plus playing and beating higher lvl players should boost your mmr and thats always good.","replies":[]}]}
