It looks like an entire loss of connection, otherwise you would see input delays instead of getting kicked off entirely.  I recommend using our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to help get this fixed.  Let me know if you have any questions.","replies":[{"poster":"Pepetions","date":"2016-10-27T16:41:55.927+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the reply :).\n\nCould this be due using a wireless connection? I know its much better to use a wired one, but I don't have access to that at the moment.\nAnd do you know why the disconnect only happens in the beginning of the match?\n\nThanks again","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-27T17:25:00.410+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It could certainly be an issue, if your connection isn't strong enough to communicate all the information coming in and out once the match starts.  Your current status may simply not be strong enough to withstand that constant communication until it's resolved.  Best of luck!","replies":[{"poster":"Pepetions","date":"2016-10-27T17:54:50.076+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's odd because I have a really good wifi adapter. I'm going to try a ethernet cable soon or contact my ISP. \n\nThanks Porocles","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
