In game it does not say his Q has a -25% crit damage penalty. if this is true, shouldn't his tooltip be updated in game to show that his Q has a -25% crit damage penalty instead of the listed -10%?\n\nIt also says this: \"After 333 AD (or 267 AD if Yasuo has purchased Infinity Edge) critically striking basic attacks will do more damage than critically striking Steel Tempest due to the 25% damage penalty.\"\n\nThis seems kind of silly, why would his auto attacks ever do MORE damage than his SIGNATURE skill Steel Tempest. Shouldn't Steel Tempest always do more damage to reward landing it as opposed to just auto attacking?","replies":[]}
