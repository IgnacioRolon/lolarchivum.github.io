New client, tried to login. This message appeared, than I logged in. In the client I couldn't click on the \"Play\" button. But in some cases I could, than I started a game. After the picks I couldn't connect to the game. Reconnect didn't work, neither the restarted client couldn't fix this problem. (No possibility to connect to the game.) Sorry for my bad english, looking for someone to fix this problem.\r\nUpdate: Initiated a full repair in the new client but afterwards the problem still exists. (Still can't click the \"Play\" button.)","replies":[{"poster":"BacchusTheBeast","date":"2017-02-23T15:26:23.145+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"the message I keep getting is the casual: \"You have disconnected.
