It looks like you're having issues well before ever leaving your own local network.  I recommend running through each step of the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to help tune up your local settings, that way you can have a better route once you hop into your ISP's routing.","replies":[]}]}
