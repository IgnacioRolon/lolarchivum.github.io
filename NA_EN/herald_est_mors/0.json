The Bilgewater event from 2015 was probably Riot's peak in that sense: a story in three+1 chapters released weekly, two reworks (MF and GP), one new game mode and Butcher's Bridge (with GP as the announcer). And one of the biggest plot twists in the history of League :D\n\nIf you weren't there at the time, go check the story out: https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/site/bilgewater/#story-1 ;D\n\n\n\nSpoiler (?): when GP's rework was announced he was [released](http://www.surrenderat20.net/2015/07/514-gangplank-and-miss-fortune-champion.html) with what is now the Captain Gangplank skin as his base. When he died in the story he was disabled (the client announcement read something like \"GP is dead, can't play him anymore, sorry :P\"), ~2 weeks later the last chapter of the story was released and GP was re-enabled again, btu this time with his actual look (and the [update reveal page](https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/page/champion-update/gangplank-sails-pbe) was adjusted accordingly), and anyone who owned GP before his \"death\" was gifted the new Captain GP skin.\nIt's probably still the most memorable moment in my experience as a League player (and I don't even own GP! xD)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GreenLore","date":"2018-06-05T11:19:37.607+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Given that the guy on the picture of the deadman's plate still seems to have a biological arm,I'd say it is more likely that its not  part of  his robot arm(though then again,maybe it keeps the whole thing together?)","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Digielf","date":"2018-06-05T03:56:02.472+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It refers to Gangplank from the Burning Tides event ","replies":[]}]}
