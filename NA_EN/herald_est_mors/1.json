And this is fine, not everybody is good at the game, but see here is the issue.... I don&#039;t want them on my team. Especially in my ranked games. The system tries to balance out the MMR of teams to where the game is....&quot;fair&quot;. But in doing so, here is an example of how this is flawed. \r\n\r\nLet&#039;s say you finish your placements with a gold 5 MMR, but you get placed in silver 2. Your MMR is going to be higher than the average Silver 2 players, and to balance out your teams average, your team is going to have Silver 4 and Silver 5 players on it, while the enemy team will include Silver 2 and Silver 1 players. Solely because you had a higher MMR, the game pairs you with people who have lower than average to balance it out. Now MMR isn&#039;t everything, but it does usually say something about a players ability to win a game. And when the game basically punishes you for being better than where you are placed, there is an issue. This problem is especially relevant for support mains, who cannot possibly solo carry games, (unless they are Brand), when their teams are full of lower tier players against players with higher tiers. Put a Bronze 1 mid against a Silver 3 mid, you will most likely notice a difference in playstyle that gives the advantage to the Silver 3.\r\n\r\nIdk, I know in my heart some of you guys have noticed this system is flawed, and I know Riot wants everybody to have a 50-50 win rate but the fact that players can be punished for playing above the tier they are placed at is aggravating to say the least. I would prefer a longer queue time to find people of my tier to play with, then some people tiers away from me who drag my games into the ground. Hopefully you guys recognize this issue.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-06-05T03:06:24.645+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"RIP matchmaking S7.

They just need to get rid of promo series which fucks up the gap more, and same with trying to get people to 50% win/loss when it should just be strictly MMR and they'll find their natural 50% W/L when they hit their skill cap and plateau rather than forcing 50% at all times","replies":[{"poster":"Herald Est Mors","date":"2018-06-05T03:32:41.020+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Exactly, its frustrating when you lose because of being stuck with lower tier players... also somebody came on this thread and downvoted all my stuff.... do me a solid will ya fellow matchmaking exposer xD","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Herald Est Mors","date":"2018-06-05T03:08:02.868+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Note, account I used to post this is not my main, I can already SMELL the comments about \"Eww you're only Silver why are you even talking blah blah blah.....\" xD","replies":[]}]}
