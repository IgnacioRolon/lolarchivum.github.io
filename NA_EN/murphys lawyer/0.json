Is there another Ultimate level skin in the works, and if so do you suppose it will be ready soon? By this time last year, there was much speculation and rumors going around, but also a tiny bit more info (in the form of coded clues and rumors) as to the existence and eventual release of an Ultimate skin (DJ Sona). Oddly enough, I&#039;ve seen very little from Riot OR the community to this effect, so I&#039;m going to throw the question out there to see who&#039;s willing to say what about it. Not asking for specifics or anything, of course, but I&#039;d kind of like to know if there&#039;s something to look forward to anytime within the next few months or no!\r\n\r\nTo everybody else: feel free to speculate here! I know who I&#039;d like to see get it, but I&#039;ve seen very little this year thus far on the subject. Speak now, or forever hold your RP!","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-11-30T21:28:31.486+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hiya!

Since ultimate skins take literally ages to finish, whether or not one is in the works has no effect on telling us whether there's one coming soon.\n\nJust confirm that there will be another ultimate skin.....eventually...sometime in the future...","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Doct0r Phil","date":"2015-12-01T05:35:01.558+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If it's not Dragon Master Swain then Riot is never going to make that skin.  I've just accepted that as the only logical reason as to why Riot has not made it yet.  \n\nIt's actually really bothersome at the point.  I have been waiting for that skin since 2011.  Riot has said that it will get made but I have been waiting for nothing.  It's honestly the one big thing that I get frustrated with Riot about.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Solidair3","date":"2015-11-30T23:26:39.972+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It has been a while since DJ Sona came out.

Somethin along the lines of \"mother nature maokai\" and it affects summoners rift by moving around and leaving a trail of green grass, emotes that sprout flowers, grow trees, and summon the various fauna you find on the rift. This skin would be absolutely beatiful. if you've seen James Cameron's _Avatar_ that's kind of what I imagine it to be.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Harmony11","date":"2015-11-28T17:55:14.854+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If I remember correctly, this time last year Riot released a \"schedule\" for 2015 skins. It did not give specifics, but gave a rough tally of how many skins of each tier they were shooting for. For instance, I think they wanted 3 or so Legendary and 1 Ultimate.\n\nOn top of that, I believe ultimates have consistently been 1/year, with Spirit Guard Udyr being last year and DJ Sona being this year. I'm certain that we won't hear anything about an ultimate until at least late December/January.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mister Sunglow","date":"2015-11-28T14:39:20.654+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is one thing to be said about a new ultimate skin: Rito, shut up and take my money...","replies":[]},{"poster":"GreenLore","date":"2015-11-28T10:13:42.552+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the last time this question was asked(and answered by a rioter),they said that no ultimate skin was in the works currently.\nThough that was several months ago,relatively shortly after the dj-sona was released,so it might have changed by now.","replies":[]}]}
