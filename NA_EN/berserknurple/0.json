The fact that he used to be a super intelligent doctor that kept mutating himself until he turned into a giant silly purple was a good origin and way to keep Mundo interesting. He could have had really good interactions with other smart characters like Heimerdinger or Viktor. \"Mundo\" they might think. I was also hoping for Mundo and ZAC to have some sort of connection, like maybe Mundo had helped work on ZAC before he totally lost his mind and became a businessman. \n\nBut hey I'm just fanconing out right now.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Siachi","date":"2017-01-27T00:15:04.431+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm actually sort of impressed what they did. I always felt there was this disassociation with Mundo: His lore presents him as this sadistic mad scientist who developed his own chemicals that sparked his transformation, while players just saw him as the goofy hulk-expy who goes where he pleases.\n\nTurns out all they needed to do to rectify this was just simply making him a 'Doctor' in name only. One who's convinced the best way to cure his 'patients' is to cleave their head open so all the bad icky sick stuff comes out (Or just to cause them pain, because that's what the doctors did to him, and he loved every minute of it).\n\nEDIT:\nI do have a question though, if a rioter would be willing to answer. It seems like Mundo was completely aware of Ekko's time-shenanigans: I was under the impression that, to the outside observer, Ekko just seemed to do things perfectly the first time. Is this just something specific to Mundo, or do I just have the wrong idea about Ekko's Z-Drive?","replies":[{"poster":"Scoroct","date":"2017-01-27T01:32:09.158+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This was asked on reddit and was not explicitly answered as far as ive seen.  It seems something about Mundo is special (people are suggesting hyper sanity or something).  \n\nOn another note I love the idea that even with all his tries, Ekko cannot beat Mundo.

I mean, it's kinda entertaining but not really DEEP.  \"Mundo is a purple orphan (probably?) who likes pain.  No one knows why.  Now he kills everyone while calling himself a doctor.  Also he's really dumb.\"\n\nEntertaining, but it doesn't really provide any insight at all into him.  Why the hell is he purple and where is he from?  They did they same with the Jinx lore.  She's a mysterious girl from... somewhere... who MIGHT be the same as... someone... maybe.   Nothing about her was answered at all.  Rather disappointing.

As disappointing as our lack of knowledge about Jinx's origins are, this does leave them the oppurtunity to drop hints and clues along the way for us to go \"WAIT! What if!\" as the story progresses.\n\nFor Vi's background, it's \"what was her life before she lost her memory.\"  Imagine if they told us that in full when we got her updated bio?\n\nImmediate happiness? Yes.\nFeeling of rewards for uncovering her past as the story goes? Not as much.
