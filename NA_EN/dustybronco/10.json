His Q has already seen a pretty cool change, so why stop there?\r\n\r\nThe big problems with his E seem to be that it's completely unclear where its range is (unless you buy his dragonwing or whatever it's called) skin and its tied to the minutiae of your movement. It's a really useful skill in only the absolute best case scenarios.\r\n\r\nThe first step to fix it is to clearly show the range when it's in effect. This is necessary for both Corki and his opponents. Something like a red outline on the cone of effect would really help, or, like the dragonwing skin, showing marks in the general vicinity of the far end of its range. This communicates to Corki players and opponents what effect his E is having, otherwise it's completely invisible - and in this day and age, that goes against League's core values.\r\n\r\nThe other change that I think would make it better to use is to have it smartcast in any direction, and then its held there as Corki moves. Think of Lucian's ultimate, except allow Corki to still use basic attacks and his ult while it's going. This is pretty much just making the skill easier and more fair to use. Nidalee's cougar form jump used to be locked into your current direction - but later Riot realized it just feels better to have it go where you want it. Corki's E would really benefit from this, too. Or, if Riot wants to develop the tech, have it auto-target enemies in a cone of vision, so that if Corki turns around to run from his enemies, they aren't still under its effect.\r\n\r\nCorki is a dated champion, and while I think his Q change was good, his E was really the most outdated and unfun part of it. I think with these ideas, we could make it work.","replies":[{"poster":"ccseancc143","date":"2015-01-17T05:47:41.907+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would redo this this thread but call it a quality of life gameplay update.","replies":[]},{"poster":"HitsFromTheBomb","date":"2015-01-17T04:55:32.861+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cool change to q ... good change ?.. it was nerfs straight up and called such sorry to correct ya. and pretty unnecessary nerfs imo.\n\nthe point and the post though is a great idea! i agree his E could use more info/clarity for all , its even harder to get a clear idea on some skins ( like urfrider) the shots/particles are so small","replies":[]}]}
