It's for that reason that I'm puzzled that they didn't restore the loading screen loading bars. They were removed because there \"wasn't space for them\" with the updated loading screen, but the loading percentages just should have been a placeholder, nothing more. It's not possible to tell at a glance how far along everyone is because you need to look at each summoner individually.\r\n\r\nIt's not one of the most daunting tasks. Riot, you even changed minion bolts because they weren't clear enough at a glance. You should change this, too.","replies":[]}
