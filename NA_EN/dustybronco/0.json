Rek'Sai's damage was no different to the damage on any other bruiser and her AP Q poke was just Nidalee spears but free - it's her vision system that makes her unique and that's what they preserved.","replies":[{"poster":"Dreadlocks","date":"2016-01-18T18:37:34.572+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Just because something is unqiue doesn't make them good though.","replies":[{"poster":"Abyssphere","date":"2016-01-18T19:00:50.318+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=xApexPredator,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=WqoT722t,comment-id=00060000000000000000,timestamp=2016-01-18T18:37:34.572+0000)\n>\n> Just because something is unqiue doesn't make them good though.\n\nBut you're the one who said they didn't keep her unique.","replies":[{"poster":"Dreadlocks","date":"2016-01-18T19:43:51.491+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Pretty sure shes worse than Elise stun-bot lvl back wen she got gutted.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Bears Dont Care","date":"2016-01-18T22:58:23.919+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MotherTeresa1910,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=WqoT722t,comment-id=0006000000000000,timestamp=2016-01-18T18:23:39.828+0000)\n>\n> her AP Q poke was just Nidalee spears but free\n\nReally?\nAn ability with a 120% AP  and 390 base damage is comparable to an ability that was 180+ 100% of AP?","replies":[{"poster":"Abyssphere","date":"2016-01-18T23:35:32.820+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Bears Dont Care,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=WqoT722t,comment-id=00060000000000000001,timestamp=2016-01-18T22:58:23.919+0000)\n>\n> Really?\n> An ability with a 120% AP  and 390 base damage is comparable to an ability that was 180+ 100% of AP?\n\nAn ability with 180 + 100% AP is comparable to an ability that does 180-390 + 40-120% AP, yes. Nidalee spears very often hit for less than the max damage, meaning Rek'Sai Qs outdamaged them until about 900 range.

Easier to hit in several different ways, fired with even more safety, and comparable in cooldown at max rank. Before the AP ratio was nerfed, it was a legit thing that people played if they didn't feel like 1v5ing with AD Rek'Sai. Even post-nerf, AP Rek'Sai was better in Urf than Nidalee was, because she could actually reliably hit her constant poke.\n\nJust because Javelin Toss has higher potential damage than Prey Seeker doesn't mean it's the better ability.

How on earth do you reconcile between LCS and Diamond level play? (And don't say Riot shouldn't, because they are going to ensure that the pro scene remains interesting, regardless of where they balance 95% of their game around.) \n\nI personally think it's perfectly fine focusing her around team efforts. You wouldn't be able to increase her Solo power without removing some of her utility, And that's ultimately going to change up Rek'sai by far too much.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Troiann","date":"2016-01-18T17:41:45.093+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah they absolutely gutted her damage and the knockup radius nerf was just like....really?\n\nShe's absolute garbage in soloqueue because her mobility, while on paper it looks decent, just feels like nothing.
