This was my favorite icon, and I&#039;m really disappointed in what they changed it to. I&#039;m not sure if I still would have bought the pack if the icon was what it is now.\n\nRiot, please change this back. It&#039;s not right to alter things like this after people already paid for them.\n\nTo clarify, I don&#039;t want a refund and I&#039;m not here for sympathy RP. I just thought this was a really cool icon, and doing massive changes to icons people paid for is a bad precedent. Skins I can understand, but this has no effect on gameplay...\n\nEdit: It was recommended that I post here for a higher chance of having a Rioter chime in. Here's my GD thread, feel free to read through the comments and see other people really dislike this change too.

I don't get WHY you'd spend that much RP for just an Icon. That's a waste of money whether the icon is changed or not. You just spent enough RP to get a really nice skin just for a crappy icon.","replies":[{"poster":"sma11 cat","date":"2017-12-09T15:18:45.582+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The icon was the deciding factor. \nI bought it to get overpriced mission tokens, but the icon I felt justified the purchase (because I liked it so much). \n\nDoesn't seem like riot actually cares (I don't understand why they can't just give us both versions as an apology for changing it after it was released), but I would have definitely NOT bought the mission line for this overly bright hot mess.\n\nWhat it feels like:\nBuying a game online and receiving a title other than the one you ordered. Sure you could go to the trouble of paying for return shipping and hoping the company will honor your order.... but you just want what you were expecting when you made the purchase. Just because they're both 'games' doesnt make them not completely different.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Gidrah","date":"2017-10-02T09:30:23.124+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree the new one looks washed out and awful.
