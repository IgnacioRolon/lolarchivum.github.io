His kit is very outdated, and could at least benefit from a range indicator on his W. \r\n\r\nI hear about updates for WW, a character redefine for Poppy, and a Taric VU - but let's face it. Now that Sion's and Heimerdinger's updates are done, Kennen is the one who needs it the most.","replies":[{"poster":"Rate of Decay","date":"2014-11-26T16:59:41.808+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ken has no damage and he runs out of energy after one combo leaving himself useless for the rest of the fight. He is in the top 3 champs needing a complete rework right now, especially with the new items and a million easy ways to counter him.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Narasimha","date":"2014-11-14T20:22:03.265+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, Taric definitely needs it the most. I would say Urgot, but he needs a Sion-style redo as well, so that could take longer.","replies":[]}]}
