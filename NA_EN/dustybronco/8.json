Or win it.\" If he's in trouble, he gets a GIANT speed boost and runs away. If he's on the offensive, he doesn't have a range indicator on his W (as opposed to Twitch) so it's kind of a guessing game. His ultimate is the best part of his kit.\r\n\r\nI think he really needs attention. Warwick is playable. Even Gangplank is better off than Kennen.","replies":[{"poster":"Maximum Zilean","date":"2014-12-18T05:38:59.529+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree he could use a few QoL changes like the range indicator on W like you mentioned.\n\nBut first, a visual update. He looks like a bean bag with a rubber band on the center.","replies":[{"poster":"DustyBronco","date":"2014-12-18T17:08:29.808+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I also thinks he needs a minor kit redesign, as his E is one of the worst abilities in the game to play against.\n\nIt's so hard to kill a Kennen because he can just instantly get away.","replies":[]}]}]}
