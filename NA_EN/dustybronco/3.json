This was my favorite icon, and I&#039;m really disappointed in what they changed it to. I&#039;m not sure if I still would have bought the pack if the icon was what it is now.\n\nRiot, please change this back. It&#039;s not right to alter things like this after people already paid for them.\n\nEdit: To clarify, I don't want a refund and I'm not here for sympathy RP. I just thought this was a really cool icon, and doing massive changes to icons people paid for is a bad precedent. Skins I can understand, but this has no effect on gameplay...","replies":[]}
