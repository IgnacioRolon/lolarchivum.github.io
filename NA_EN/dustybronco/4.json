What's that? It's a little bit more visible with his dragon wing skin, but that's hardly fair. Playing with it or against it is just not clear. \n\nI also think it should go the way of Nid's cougar W, where it was changed from \"the direction of wherever you're currently looking\" to \"free cast it.\" When she received her VU, you (Riot) defended that it wasn't free cast. You've since changed your mind. From a gameplay standpoint, I think his E would be a much better ability if you could select where the cone goes within a 180 degree radius (and then are locked in that direction until cancelled, like Lucian's ult).\n\nIt's not clear to use, nor fun to use...maybe it's time to think about updating it to our current standards.","replies":[{"poster":"SmokingPuffin","date":"2015-02-10T23:42:27.891+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Corki and other players on both teams cannot see his E's cone of effect because it looks like a line of raindrops at the edge of its range.\n\nIt's a legit gripe.  We've seen other AoE buttons get a clear delineation of where they will hit, and it seems all upside to me.\n\n> From a gameplay standpoint, I think his E would be a much better ability if you could select where the cone goes (and then are locked in that direction until cancelled, like Lucian's ult).\n\nThis is a problematic mechanic.  Currently Corki E is strong when chasing and useless when kiting.  If you make it work like Lucian R, it's strong in both usage models.  It's a big design shift that I don't think will work out well.","replies":[{"poster":"DustyBronco","date":"2015-02-10T23:45:11.371+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for pointing that out - I didn't clarify that I meant within a 180 degree cone of where he is facing on activation (or even 90 would work fine).","replies":[]}]}]}
