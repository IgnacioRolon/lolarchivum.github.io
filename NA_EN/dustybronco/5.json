That being said, her ears just seem distractingly large and I think they work against the overall appeal of the skin. I think they make her look more like Twitch and take away from her identity as a Yordle / Megling gunner.","replies":[{"poster":"2000boxes","date":"2015-01-14T03:54:21.818+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"what do ears have to do with being a gunner?","replies":[{"poster":"DustyBronco","date":"2015-01-14T03:56:22.504+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Easy - they make her less aerodynamic.

And Gnar is actually a good example of the other side of 2 extremes with him being the mostly animal version and I guess Heimerdinger being the more human looking one. Tristana was supposed to be somewhere in between with her animalistic attraction to explosions but her intelligent approach to creating them. If for some reason Ziggs ever receives an update like this he will likely fall within the same space as Tristana for new looks.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Anonymousaur","date":"2015-01-14T04:44:02.880+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"*cough*Gnar*cough*","replies":[{"poster":"DustyBronco","date":"2015-01-14T04:47:20.272+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Uh...good point, actually.
