Re: S2 Riven","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Miscellaneous","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"I don't think it's right that championship Riven is going to be re-released for everyone. Here's why.\r\n\r\nI started playing in Season 2. I wasn't comfortable enough to play ranked, but I enjoyed playing co-op v AI and normals with my friends. When championship Riven came out, it was meant to commemorate S2 - in fact, Riot suggested we \"celebrate\" season 2 with this skin and noted it would never be available again (which would make sense, as season 2 was not made available again). I bought it, and to date it's my favorite skin.\r\n\r\nWhere does the \"I\" fit into my point? Well, when summoners started playing League is integral to their identity within League. Ask any summoner what the login screen (or first champion released, first visual update, etc.) was when they first started playing, and chances are they'll be able to tell you. Our favorite items that aren't in the shop anymore, our favorite old version of champion abilities - this kind of thing can really flesh out the individual in an MMO where everyone is playing the same characters. Championship Riven is one way of saying \"Yeah. I've been here for THAT long.\" And I think that's something that allies and enemies alike find noteworthy. This goes for other limited \"you had to be there\" skins like Black Alistar, UFO Corki, and King Rammus. Players who own those can flaunt those because they earned them. They've been around long enough to where they just aren't so common anymore, and one may wonder what interesting things about League that player knows that you don't. It's like a grandpa telling you about WW2, I guess.\r\n\r\nAnyway, Championship Riven is my way of saying \"Hey. I was there. I supported Riot all the way back then, you crazy kids and your map burrowing...let me tell you about leviathan and Dr. Mundo.\" Indeed, I bought championship Riven to celebrate season 2. Every time I use it in-game, I think back to the \"good ol' days\" (which, of course, aren't as good as now) and it brings me some measure of happiness. Plus, it's nice to see people in-game shocked, since it's not a common skin.\r\n\r\nSo, Riot, I don't understand why you want to take that away from me and other Season 2 veterans. Why? Is it because people just *want* it? That shouldn't be enough. What of players who joined season 3, season 4, or will join in season 5 - why do they want to celebrate season 2? **If we were here to financially support you during season 2, before League became the most-played MMO in NA and EU, why can't you give this back to us?** This skin remaining exclusive was the *closest* thing I've ever seen from Riot to long-term player gratitude, and now that's out of the question because new League players want a pretty skin. I just don't understand.\r\n\r\nIf wanting a skin is all it takes for it to no longer be exclusive, and if how much it matters to long-time players also doesn't matter, tell you what: I want UFO Corki, King Rammus and Black Alistar for 975 RP each. I want Victorious Jarvan IV and Victorious Janna. I mean, if I place in gold eventually, I should \"earn\" those since skin exclusivity is bad, right? Since the idea of total lifetime RP purchases were thrown out the window, you don't care if you desecrate pre-order incentives, registered-by incentives, or gold-by incentives, right?\r\n\r\nLastly, I don't care if you changed your mind that championship skins should be legacy going forward. That's fine. That doesn't mean that Championship Riven should retroactively be changed.\r\n\r\nDiscuss.","replies":[{"poster":"Jamaree","date":"2015-01-08T07:25:06.131+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They are re releasing Championship Riven?","replies":[{"poster":"Oliver The Fiend","date":"2015-01-08T07:38:49.596+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, since when?
