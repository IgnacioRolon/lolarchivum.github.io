Also I don&#039;t have evidence to back this up but there seems to be a heavy bias towards free champs and seemingly &quot;OP&quot; champs. \n\nI have seen {{champion:105}} {{champion:30}} {{champion:223}}  {{champion:5}} {{champion:74}}{{champion:11}}  {{champion:57}} {{champion:141}} {{champion:90}}{{champion:86}}  {{champion:17}} {{champion:62}} {{champion:4}} far more than any others. I&#039;ve yet to see a {{champion:254}} or {{champion:9}}. \n\nAnother issue I have is that random... really isnt fun at all. It&#039;s basically whoever gets the OP champs wins, plain and simple. Sometimes you may get lucky and roll a counter to one of them but more often than not it&#039;s whoever gets {{champion:114}} and {{champion:5}} on the same team wins. \n\nAt least when it was pick what you want, it was OP vs. OP and you got to play what you want and have fun with it. Now it&#039;s Lucky vs. Unlucky and you have a mediocre amount of fun with a champ you don&#039;t really like playing.","replies":[]}
