To prevent abuse, queue dodging a second time while in Nemesis Draft can result in a 2-hour lower priority queue per our [Nemesis Draft](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204191960-Nemesis-Draft-Mode-FAQ#h2q2) guide.  [Queue dodge](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751844-Queue-Dodging) escalations can stack regardless of what game mode that dodge occurred.  I know that sucks to hear, but hopefully it helps clear things up!","replies":[{"poster":"the weeaboo","date":"2016-08-20T19:00:39.493+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I strictly remember this being my first dodge in a while, but If you say so guess I'll just wait it out.

Yeah okay, it might be a match up you dont want to play... but just do it anyway. Its not like you are locked into playing it for life.","replies":[{"poster":"the weeaboo","date":"2016-08-21T04:02:03.114+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"No dodging is essential. If I'm playing ranked and some guys are being toxic before the match starts I will not hesitate to dodge. -3 LP is better then -20 LP and getting tilted because allies were toxic ( and then losing further games). I could tell these guys were going to be toxic because I asked \"Is there a reason you guys chose Noc and Singed because those are good champs in any comp\" and they responded with \"go play ranked and bitch about it crybaby\"","replies":[{"poster":"Antioxidans","date":"2016-08-21T14:46:22.068+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well there is a huge difference between ranked and nemesis draft... I completely understand if players dodge a ranked, but it's just extremely annoying in a fun mode where it's clear from the beginning that your champion will probably be crap.\nI tried to play nemesis draft four times yesterday and 3 of those games were dodged in the last seconds of champ select. It's just a huge waste of time... In my opinion fun modes like ARAM and nemesis draft should have a seperate dodge escalation from ranked, but should be punished harder.","replies":[{"poster":"the Anarchit3cht","date":"2016-08-22T08:07:18.990+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Dodging is always unacceptable. You get some shit games, deal with it. Or dont queue up. If you're so worried about not getting the perfect game, play a custom game with some buddies and quit wasting everyones time.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Nerdojoe","date":"2016-08-22T03:51:43.031+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, I am unable to access the Nemesis Draft guide.
