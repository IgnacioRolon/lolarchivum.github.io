I was getting about 500-600 kbps, now its at 33% and 50-150 kbps. Any fixes you guys know of? I've tried repairing the files, deleting lol_launcher, etc. \r\n\r\nAdding S_OK to ones where its missing got the PvP.net Client to open, but when I tried to go into a game it crashes inbetween Champ Select and Loading screen.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-16T22:16:43.999+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Deleting files may have actually caused more problems than good.  Closing the launcher and restarting it would cause the patcher to rescan files to make sure nothing is corrupt.  It would take a few moments for that to complete before it proceeds with the update.  Since there are now files missing, a repair may be necessary.  You can download our [hextech repair tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367) which can give you a clean slate reinstall.  That should get you back on track!","replies":[{"poster":"the weeaboo","date":"2016-08-17T00:18:12.828+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay. Thanks Poro","replies":[]}]}]}
