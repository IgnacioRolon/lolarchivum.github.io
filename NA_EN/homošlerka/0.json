Here is in game chat.\r\n\r\nGame 1\r\nIn-Game\r\nHomošlerka: :D\r\nHomošlerka: :D\r\nHomošlerka: hope u get dildo in ur ass\r\nHomošlerka: fucking gay ryze :D\r\nHomošlerka: :D\r\nHomošlerka: fucking r%%%%%ed greece %%% :D\r\nHomošlerka: talking with ryze :) i have np with u :)\r\nHomošlerka: wp\r\nHomošlerka: :D\r\nHomošlerka: ggwp :)\r\nHomošlerka: ryze u are fucktarded %%%\r\nHomošlerka: :D\r\nHomošlerka: i wish u all good :D\r\n\r\nMy problem is. If i got the worst punishment, got banned, for calling teammate names like \"gay, %%%, r%%%%%\". Why it is so common in losing games? Why when i play my main role as a jungler and some lane is losing. They call me names like \"motherfucker, idiot, r%%%%% etc.\". Every player here knows when your team starts losing, even one mistake can result in \"report him, he is inting...\" in all chat, and in team chat you are being verbal abused. \r\n\r\nWhy is it so common to read lines like, \"go kill yourself\" \"i fucked your mother\" or as in my banning game \"get cancer\". I did not even do anything wrong, my midlane went for a fight i pinged warning ping that i wont come (had low hp and mana) and then i got verbal abused for not following. \r\n\r\nRagequit, afking after failed surrender and real intentional feeding are like in every 1 of 7 games i play.\r\n\r\nWith Riots standards so high you get banned without a warning, i did not get chat restriction, warning or honor level down in a long time, for calling teammate names like \"gay, %%%, r%%%%%\". I am curios about Riots moral compass, is it okay to flame your jungler, but not to tell someone is r%%%%%? What is worse, to wish for someones death or call him mentaly ill? \r\n\r\nI wish to see some list of bad things you can do in game that earn you naughty points and how much naughty points you get. Because in my case i has to report like player in 1 of 2 games that i lost. Sometimes even in winning games. I dont know if they are being banned or anything, dont know if its because Riot doesnt want to announce it that i played game with toxic player and he got punished or all that reports went to trash can. And every 100th person will get randomly banned.\r\n\r\nConclusion: After being banned for 2 weeks without a warning for calling teammate names like \"gay, %%%, r%%%%%\". Why is this game still so toxic when its not going so well?","replies":[{"poster":"Subdue","date":"2019-12-20T00:32:40.444+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"The rules are very clear.  Be a decent human being.  Beyond that, hate speech and calls for self harm are not tolerated.  Hate speech is defined as \"abusive or threatening speech or writing that expresses prejudice against a particular group, especially on the basis of race, religion, or sexual orientation.\"\n\nI personally don't run into hate speech all that often on LoL, but when I do I always report it, even if it isn't directed at me.  There's no place for that crap here.\n\nI mean honestly, these are life lessons that should have been learned in pre-school.","replies":[{"poster":"Homošlerka","date":"2019-12-20T00:55:08.756+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I agree with you, that should be not and are not tolerated.

You remember those experiences because of negativity bias - that is, you remember things that are negative more strongly than things that are proportionally positive.\n\nThe less obvious answer is that part of it is your own behavior.  Some things you say or do trigger or encourage that behavior in others.  If you make an attempt to deescalate the situation, or at least mute immediately when the flaming starts, most of the time people stop before it gets to that point.  However, if you escalate the situation, argue with people, it's more likely to reach that point.  This is not to say that you are responsible for their behavior.  Everyone is responsible for their own behavior.  In a game where two people are being toxic to each other, I report both and you should too.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"GatekeeperTDS","date":"2019-12-20T01:28:58.674+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"You used homophobic slurs.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nightsky Pirate","date":"2019-12-20T00:42:54.788+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":9,"body":"The punishment system does not take into account that any given person can have hundreds of accounts.
