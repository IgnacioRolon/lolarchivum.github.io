It sounds like your network can't hold onto a connection to the game server, which would ultimately end up with a disconnection.  I suggest using our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to tune up your network and make sure everything is running in order.
