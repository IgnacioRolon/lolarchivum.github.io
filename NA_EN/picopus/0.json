S7 changes.","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"There are 2 sides to every story, and with all the hate flowing on the forum I would like to share my honest opinion on the changes everyone say will &quot;fuck up&quot; their experience.\r\n\r\nThe new plants litteraly are the rift heralds of this season &quot;sololane buff that lasts 20min, rip toplane diversity&quot; \r\nPlants look fun and adds great playmaking potential. And they always spawn at given times and locations. Plants are as random as Gromp and Baron in that sense. \r\nThe worst that can happen is that we see more fighting, more plays and back less to base. \r\n\r\nRemoval of Draft normal, hold on to your hats. In few days flex mode will be out. If this mmr is fresh you can play with friends all you want. To &quot;practice ranked play&quot; just play ranked, same as normal draft but you will actually face players your own skill lvl.i have not seen a good argument not to. Let&#039;s see how flex pick works, if it&#039;s bad. Then we can start hatin&#039;.\r\n\r\nItemsets had 2 good uses. Odd ap champs (AP kog) and odd Tank champs (Tank Fizz). The rest of the champs got good recommended item list used by 99% of the playerbase. Pretty sure the removal will have no impact on the gameplay at all. (Except the odd eggs in the basket that riot try to force out of the meta)\r\n\r\nFor the S7 changes I have seen, as a Twitch main, I&#039;m not that happy, but I trust riot games&#039; months of playtesting to have balanced the champs as close to a healthy state as possible. \r\n\r\nTL;DR I like the new changes (love the plants). Riot rarely misses, noone likes change. With some tuning Dynamic queue, Rift Herald and ARpen items of last season turned out just fine. (I loved Dynamic queue)","replies":[{"poster":"Dêcoy","date":"2016-11-09T09:24:08.016+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yey, Riot took down Normal Draft but gave us another ranked queue - lets make sure we destroy the ranked experience for players who wants to climb with friends by playing random stuff in there <3 \n\nAm I the only who thinks this is weird fn mindset to have?","replies":[{"poster":"Picopus","date":"2016-11-09T09:53:43.453+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"If you want to play random stuff, why not play the more popular blindpick?","replies":[{"poster":"Dêcoy","date":"2016-11-09T10:07:08.159+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because it's toxic? I don't want to play without knowing what Im playing against - it makes no sense, it won't help me practice for ranked games, same as mirror matchups.

It may be shocking, but there are people who do take team rank seriously. \n\nAlso the hate on plants isn't because people think they're OP like the RH's buff, it's just that they're really really lame. And so is the RH buff too for that matter, considering people don't even bother taking it even in pro play.\n\nAnd the recommended builds are for the most part completely at odds with what people actually build in higher elos. Maybe in bronze and pre-30 most people do build like it, but I'd say that's precisely because those players don't know enough to realize the recommended builds are so bad in the first place.
