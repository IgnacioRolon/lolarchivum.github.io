You might be capping your framerate through your in-game video options, definitely check that option out when you get a chance.  Keep in mind that you may run into issues if you decide to uncap it.  Our [FPS issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting) guide may help as well in case your frame drops are being caused by driver issues or bad game files.
