With this type of community and this type of shit developer support, it is no doubt too late for me to realize that league of legends has become a trash game. Earlier today, I was banned in chat for asking for help jungling. The whole team watched while the other jungler took all my camps and continued to camp me. Needless to say, according to everyone on that team, I was to blame for the loss of that game. Also just to top it off, I was banned from typing in chat because I was apparently had unsportsmanlike behavior. I am forever finished with this piece of shit they call game and their toxic community. For those of you that keeps going even after you read this, good luck with the rest of your life being a miserable individual, because this game has not been fun since Tencent.","replies":[{"poster":"Prandine","date":"2019-08-16T13:10:51.820+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":0,"body":"While Necromancy may be handy (and sometimes needed) in media, it is not the case for old forum threads.

League has gone so far downhill.  Give every new champ a whole no risk high reward kit. You cant dare play outside god tier champs or you will just get crushed. And if you dont counter pick it's your fault you were first pick. This game has become the salt mine and its it's horrible.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Telephone Booth","date":"2019-04-08T21:46:08.025+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol that happened to me last night. It was 15-1 at one point, all lanes losing, but yeah blame the yi jungle because jungle is supposed to win every lane for you. I dont get all pissy and start arguing with people though, thats a waste of time, and only opens your account to punishment. Since you cant argue, just ignore them and report after. If i could just talk shit back i wouldnt report, but since I dont want my account banned, I'm forced to bite my lip and reporting is the only satisfaction I can get. If i talked shit back, they would just report me, so be smart and dont type, and report them. Gotta expect games like that in a PvP game. Pretty easy to just shake it off and accept reality and move on.","replies":[{"poster":"Idontalwaysmid","date":"2019-04-10T22:09:35.736+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for understanding where I'm coming from.
