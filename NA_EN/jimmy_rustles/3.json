She can actually deal damage to the top tanks right now and has sufficient peel for the 1 shot meta. Is she overtuned? Yup. She has to be to compete with the other overtuned supports like Naut/Leona who become invincible level 3. I'm all for nerfing her, if we also nerf the others.\n\nI'm not sure where this argument of \"she's preforming well in a meta she shouldn't be preforming well in\" came from. If she's doing well in the current meta, then she is \"supposed\" to be preforming well in that meta. It's like saying Morgana shouldn't be preforming in this meta because she's not doing what the other engage supports are doing. She's meta precisely because she counters the meta, just like Senna.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Lewd Neeko","date":"2019-11-26T19:23:58.038+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":6,"body":"Well, doesn't it make sense that new champs have high pick rates after release?

I mean you don't make the updates you don't create new champions... Essentially the only thing you do for this game from the looks of it is come here and try to tell people what's what from your own beliefs. But regardless I don't SEE anywhere that defines what a support SHOULD be? So if riot wanted supports to be able to actually have a build then who are you to stop them? You seem extremely biased into hating the support role but yet I bet a good support is the exact reason you feel good when you play the game and think you're \"carrying\" and get a lot of kills, but how many kills less would you be if the support didn't  set them up for you through the use of vision and well timed shields/cc. Besides it is extremely ignorant to say that a role that you don't like should be blatantly deprived of income. What about solo queue for someone who likes playing support? Are they just supposed to be thousands of gold behind because according to you they should \"give their resources to others.\" Really? I should give resources to my random mid yasuo who is 0/6? Or my jungler who has attempted to tower the enemies in my lane and died 3-4 times? The reason supports NEED to have an income that is roughly similar to a laner is so that the whole game isn't down to \"does this other player on my team know how to play the game\" or \"did the enemy counter pick my otp laner\" your anger seems to be mostly directed at the mage supports who can sometimes have the ability to come out of lane with roughly the same build as they would in mid but honestly, despite the fact that I didn't watch all of the games at world's I don't remember seeing a single mage support as where I definitely saw a lot of Nautilus, so maybe, just maybe your pov is ABSURDLY biased?","replies":[{"poster":"GonahtanuGepardi","date":"2019-11-30T15:56:17.751+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">You talk a lot about \"how support was meant to be\".... correct me if I'm wrong but I don't believe you own league of legends?

It has nothing to do with my beliefs but absolute facts.\n\n>But regardless I don't SEE anywhere that defines what a support SHOULD be?\n\nThat's because you don't think, are inexperienced and lack basic game knowledge. I literally explained to you what defines what supports are supposed to be and yet you act like you didn't even read it (because you probably didn't). It makes perfect sense.\n\nIt's not riot that invented the support role and it's definition but the players, more specifically, the professional players. Instead of sharing the gold on the map between 5 players, they decided that it's much better to share it between 4 players and have that one player play a utility champion that is useful even without gold so the team gets overall stronger without having a useless member on the team. It's a perfect strategy, the earliest for of funnel in fact. That gave birth to the support role that exists in other moba games too, like dota 2 for the exact same reason. What the players INVENTED it for is what it is supposed to be. That is what defines it. It was the players anyway that defined the current role meta (1 top, 1 jungle, 1 mid and 2 bot and what kind of champions go to those roles), not riot.\n\n>So if riot wanted supports to be able to actually have a build then who are you to stop them?\n\nYou are right about that. If riot want to redefine a role then they are absolutely in a position to do it. It's their game and they have the power. That doesn't mean they SHOULD do it.\n\n>You seem extremely biased into hating the support role\n\nNothing points to me hating the support role. Absolutely nothing. That's a just a baseless assumption made by you because you want to look like a victim. I'm literally trying to reinforce what it means to be a support unlike you.\n\n>but yet I bet a good support is the exact reason you feel good when you play the game and think you're \"carrying\" and get a lot of kills, but how many kills less would you be if the support didn't set them up for you through the use of vision and well timed shields/cc.\n\nSometimes yes but more often it's the support that gets carried because they are mostly clueless about the game. I can set up my own kills as a mid laner but i do know when the support helped. However, none of this has anything to do with the topic and is just here because you can't figure out an actual counter point so you just try to attack me personally.\n\n>Besides it is extremely ignorant to say that a role that you don't like should be blatantly deprived of income.\n\nIt's ignorant to say they shouldn't be. And i still don't hate the role. The reason why they should be deprived of income is listed above and i'm not going to repeat myself.\n\n>What about solo queue for someone who likes playing support? Are they just supposed to be thousands of gold behind because according to you they should \"give their resources to others.\" Really? I should give resources to my random mid yasuo who is 0/6? Or my jungler who has attempted to tower the enemies in my lane and died 3-4 times?\n\nYes, you should. One other good reason is that they benefit from gold way more than you do. You are already useful without gold while someone like yasuo isn't. Giving him the gold is going to benefit your team way more than taking the gold on a support.\n\n> The reason supports NEED to have an income that is roughly similar to a laner is so that the whole game isn't down to \"does this other player on my team know how to play the game\" or \"did the enemy counter pick my otp laner\"\n\nThat's not the reason why laners need gold... Laners need gold to get items so they can be useful in the way they are meant to be useful. You know, carries deal more damage and tanks can take more damage and split pushers can split push better etc. Supports don't need gold to be good at supporting. And gold doesn't make up for the lack of skill. If we look at this from a balance perspective, we have to assume everyone in the match is around the same skill level, which means you taking the gold instead of your ally yasuo or something is not going to help your team because overall you aren't any better at the game than he is and since he is playing a champion that benefits more from the gold than you do, he should get it. You taking a gold from a yasuo as a braum or some shit like that isn't going to be a good thing for your team. That's an undeniable fact.\n\n> your anger\n\nWhat anger? Stating facts doesn't make me angry. You are attacking me personally again because you don't have any valid arguments.\n\n> seems to be mostly directed at the mage supports who can sometimes have the ability to come out of lane with roughly the same build as they would in mid but honestly, despite the fact that I didn't watch all of the games at world's I don't remember seeing a single mage support as where I definitely saw a lot of Nautilus, so maybe, just maybe your pov is ABSURDLY biased?\n\nOr your pov is ABSURDLY ignorant. First of all, {{champion:79}} {{champion:9}} {{champion:99}} were played as mage supports at worlds and i didn't count champions like {{champion:43}} as a mage support in this case because she is at least meant to be a support, even though she is still working like a mage support.\n\nSecondly, even if they aren't picked at worlds, they can still be extremely viable. Pros value strong peel or engage options on supports over damage supports because it gives them more tools to work around. Also kinda supports my point about what supports are supposed to be, no pun intended. But back to the point. Most people don't play pro scene so it matters more what we see in places like soloq and how powerful things are there because that's what most people can experience. Mage supports are strong in soloq so trying to use pro scene as a way to imply that they aren't strong is not a valid method of doing so.\n\nThirdly, do not hate mage supports. I just don't like them because a) they don't offer anything that an actual champion meant to be a support does and b) they are only viable due to high gold income that supports have gotten over the years.

Here are my thoughts on her:\n\n-She is way too safe for a champion that scales infinitely. You should be able to shut her down early to halt her scaling in its tracks, but with the combination of her AoE CC, camoflouging shroud, and ridiculous range, you can't do that.\n\n-Other champions that scale very hard (Vayne, Kog, Twitch) have extremely short range and punishable early games to offer big windows to shut them down. Why doesn't Senna have that too?\n\n-Her Q being able to target literally everything except thin air will need to go. Senna can use Piercing Darkness on fruits in the jungle, on wards, towers, etc, for a free heal that can save her in too many situations. It's also pretty cancer when she snipes you by placing a ward and Q'ing through it when you thought you were out of range. Maybe change it so Senna can only q through ally champions, minions, and maybe towers.\n\n-Her W is pretty much a mini Varus ult. The root is pretty long with a generous hitbox, and for a peel/cc ability it does a damn good bit of damage. The one or two seconds you have before you're cc'ed usually isn't enough unless you're playing Pyke or Yuumi. Perhaps lower the damage, change it so it detonates instantly but only hits one person, like an ahri charm almost. It feels terrible to have your ally get hit by Last Embrace, and then you're dead too because you couldn't get away from them in time. (It's almost like playing against zilean.)\n\n-I really do have a problem with her E. It's a strange ability, but one that will be completely busted in highly coordinated play. What's not to love? You don't know who's coming at you, the 15/0 Kha'Zix or the 2/6 Draven. While this ability does SOUND cool, it's extremely frustrating to play against. Why does it make you unselectable? It's like an AoE Vlad pool that speeds you up instead of slow you down, that also hides your identity. \n\nIf Rito don't do something this patch, just wait until Senna is inevitably picked in pro play. She'll see her nerfs soon enough then.","replies":[{"poster":"Illabethe","date":"2019-11-29T17:53:27.999+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Too safe yet she averages 1.6 more deaths than any meta support, and 2 more deaths than any ADC.\n\n2) She does.
