She is a weak teamfighter because cc destroys her,  she is squishy and she can easily be kited.  Champions like janna can totally negate her and she isn&#039;t the splitpushing monster jax or irelia are.   She gets outscaled and is a very hit or miss, inconsistent early game.   Stop playing riven in ranked,  it&#039;s unfair to your teammates and frankly quite dumb.  That said,  Riven might be able to be fixed if her Q and passive can crit for 1.75x damage much like yasuo Q.","replies":[{"poster":"Moooose3","date":"2017-04-08T04:19:23.248+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riven is shit if you're shit at her.

If you are forced into a late game, everyone else does too much damage for Riven to survive in a team fight.\n\nWhile I wouldn't go as far as this guy and says she's useless, you basically have to ensure you snowball really hard early because if you can't then late game you are just banking on your teammates to carry you.","replies":[{"poster":"NvestmentPlanker","date":"2017-04-08T05:20:30.986+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"in what way is she in a bad spot? 50% winrate with a 10% playrate.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Challenger Ahri","date":"2017-04-08T05:17:59.740+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=LuLBRNA,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=gREfU3oV,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2017-04-08T04:26:19.255+0000)\n>\n> Riven is in a pretty bad spot right now, what he said isn&#x27;t entirely true, but it&#x27;s not wrong either.\n> \n> Because of the Lethality nerf Riven doesn&#x27;t have enough damage early game anymore against the majority of meta top laners.
