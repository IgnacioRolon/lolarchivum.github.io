The thing is that the strategy the people were using looked a lot like trolling and their teammates overwhelmingly reported for it.\n\nThe players in question were using Singed and Nunu as support, taking smite, and counter jungling the entire game, leaving their adc to solo lane. This strategy had positive win rates but made their own team pretty upset. Since then Riot has said that if you are using a strategy like that you need to explain it to your team pre game and if your team requests you not to use it to listen to them or something like that.","replies":[{"poster":"Silent Gravity","date":"2018-03-12T03:36:33.554+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"*The strategy had a negative winrate in the support Singed case.

It is possible to skip to a Two Week or Permanent suspension based on the severity of the behavior in the game. There are different tiers of punishments, and they generally follow this path:\n\n* First Offense: 10 Game Chat Restriction\n* Second Offense: 25 Game Chat Restriction\n* Third Offense: Two Week Suspension\n* Fourth Offense: Permanent Suspension\n\nIf they had a prior two week suspension, any further violations that warrant punishment will result in a permanent suspension, no matter how minor the violation is. Sounds to me like they did more than simply asking a teammate to report someone though. \n\nMaybe you could ask them to make a post on the boards themselves and include their chat logs? We could help get to the bottom of this and see if it was really warranted or a mistake.","replies":[{"poster":"iChristinaa","date":"2018-03-12T02:51:29.961+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Question, when a player is calling the enemy team racial slurs, such as the n-word, and \"gay\", is it wrong to call that player a racist homophobe?","replies":[{"poster":"Final Spark Lux","date":"2018-03-12T03:09:18.193+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Believe it or not, yes, though I'm willing to bet that isn't all that was said. Every player is responsible for their own actions as well as what they do or don't say, regardless of anyone else's behavior. While it's unfortunate that they had to deal with someone like that, it doesn't give them the right to stoop to their level and start calling them names or insulting them back. The best option in these situations is -always- to mute the offending player and report them after the game.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"YerroFever","date":"2018-03-12T02:57:24.772+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have your friend come on the forums and post the chat log.
