Compensation: you keep your buff\r\n - Snowball: Incredibly easy to die to jungle invaders/campers. Especially stealth champs. Compensation: None. You die.\r\n\r\n2) Dragon bloody hurts.\r\n - Snowball: Kill dragon. Get stronger. Compensation: Dragon bloody hurts. You can get wrecked if you start it.\r\n - Whoever gets dragon though, snowballs.\r\n\r\n3) Tower shields\r\n - Ok, so to combat all these snowball mechanics, Riot decided to add shields to towers as well as passive aura shields. The question is, why do this when you added the snowball mechanics in the first place? Riot's decision-making contradicts everything they do. \r\n\r\n4) Tower 30-80% armor penetration..\r\n - Ok, so to combat diving from snowballed teams, Riot decides to make it incredibly hard to dive, as your tank is going to get shredded immediately. \r\n \r\nHonestly, the two tower changes above makes it incredibly painful to play a game. The game can immediately snowball to a point where you're stuck in your base all day before 20 minutes. BUT, the enemy team can't end the game. BUT, since you can't get out of base, the enemy team still gets more gold than you and gets even more ahead. AND SO, you'll eventually lose no matter what after 20 minutes of hanging on for dear life in your base. AND, it'll probably be a 5-0 teamfight when the enemy team finally decides to dive you. \r\n\r\nAlso, because junglers have been gimped so hard and the jungle is so strong, it's very simple to just target the jungler and keep him 5 levels below everyone else, reducing the game to a 5v4.","replies":[]}
