In regular League, XP translates to capsules that gives me real stuff.  Same for quests; you get tokens to buy real stuff.  In TFT they give you icons, emotes, and maps... but no chance of \"skins\", as that would be analogous to LL.\n\nAnd some people certainly do speak.  Some of them are extraordinarily good sports, and I wish I could reward them for that.  I obviously wouldn't honor someone who never spoke, but I'm sad I can't show appreciation for those who legit made the game more fun.","replies":[{"poster":"Illabethe","date":"2019-08-26T01:33:38.400+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In other words, \"I play with a duo and want to reciprocate honors for some sort of reward.\"\n\nIn SR, you do not get to honor opponents.

There's no reason in TFT that you shouldn't be able to.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"iWhipple","date":"2019-08-25T21:11:47.689+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i see plenty of people speaking............{{champion:36}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Finders Keepers","date":"2019-08-26T18:52:25.456+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you get free diamond borders in all modes just climb in tft and it will be there in all other modes enjoy","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jimmy Rustles","date":"2019-08-25T20:30:06.275+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea it's almost like one is the primary game and the other is something of a spin off","replies":[]}]}
