The issue is that this results in a worthless damage report chart.  I just had a veig ult someone who had 700 health left, and BOOM no one else exists on the chart because they're totally overshadowed by veigar's 20k bar.  I had a Kennen that actually did the work (4.5k), but he looked tiny compared to the unrealistic damage meter.\r\n\r\nI don't think that killing someone with 700 health should look like Veig actually did 20k damage.","replies":[{"poster":"Pika Fox","date":"2019-07-19T17:45:15.309+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He has to deal that much because of dragon/dragon tooth.\n\nWould be difficult to actually do properly.","replies":[{"poster":"Bregan","date":"2019-07-19T18:41:49.462+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"honestly no, he really doesnt. just code it to reference the the two star values and if his is greater than the other, just kill/remove instead of doing damage (especially mitigateable damage, lol).","replies":[]}]}]}
