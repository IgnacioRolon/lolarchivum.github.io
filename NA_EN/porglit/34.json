Silver units appear in the tooltip to do bronze damage, and any amount of AP appears not to affect their spells either.  You could be fighting a Gold Voli with double hat (which does 2550 per spell), but it will say he does 200 damage.  I know it's just a tooltip problem, but it's an issue nonetheless.","replies":[]}
