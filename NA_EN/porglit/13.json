Usually, this has the possibility of profoundly impacting your build: \n\n1. Mountain gives you the ability to grab an early Mountain (2), where the large shield is more effective early game\n2. Ocean unlocks the pursuit of Ocean (6), impossible to get otherwise\n3. Inferno makes it much easier to get an assassin trio, and makes it so you only need two sunfires to get inferno (9)\n4. Cloud (3) gives you +5% dodge??\n\nWhat's up with that??  Even if you max out someone's dodge from items, the difference between 75% and 80% dodge isn't worth the hassle to get there.  All the other bonuses are strikingly better.  Why is it not +10% dodge at least?","replies":[{"poster":"rabirinsu","date":"2019-11-29T20:15:20.487+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"also Cloud Blade comp with qiyana is extremely weak against magic comp, especially now it's ocean mage meta.
