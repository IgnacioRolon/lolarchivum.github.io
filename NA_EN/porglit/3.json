Do gunslinger extra attacks proc on-hit?\n\nIf yes to all, then...\nGraves with BotRK could theoretically attack 3 times in a row from 6 blademasters, each of which hits 3 people from 4 gunslingers, each of which hits 3 people from his own ability, multiplying every single auto by 27.  Throw on {{item:3085}}  {{item:3085}} and multiply each auto by 45.","replies":[{"poster":"DartExplosion10","date":"2019-07-17T18:03:47.175+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah thats why they keep nerfing graves because of all of his synergies with red buff, pirates, etc","replies":[]}]}
