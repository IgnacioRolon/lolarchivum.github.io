But what else increases damage done by {{item:3075}} ?  Does the rest of your armor, including Guardian/Noble buff?  Does Knight synergy get added?  If I stack 2 {{item:3075}}, do they both do full damage for each other's mitigated damage? (For example, if one {{item:3075}} mitigates 100 damage, do each of them recognize that 200 damage is mitigated and each do 200 damage?)","replies":[{"poster":"1017 √ÅLYX 9SM","date":"2019-08-28T08:50:47.368+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, they stack.\nMitigated dmg = attacker's dmg - the dmg you actually took\nfor example a draven crit for 400dmg, you have 200 armor, so you are taking 100/(100+200)=33.33% dmg, approx 120dmg\nmitigated dmg(dmg reflected by thornmail) = 400-120 = 280","replies":[]},{"poster":"Illabethe","date":"2019-08-28T03:42:49.031+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Shielded damage, Immune to critical hits, Magic damage reduction, Blocked Knight damage.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ragsalot","date":"2019-08-27T22:30:19.342+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I believe they stack, given the lack of a 'unique' passive on them. \nI don't know if armor diminishing returns are calculated in the same way in TFT as on SR, but if your given amount of armor produced 50% mitigation, then yeah you should reflect the entire damage of the auto attack back at them if wearing 2 TM's.\nAnd yes, it applies to your total armor, so anything that increases armor also increases the damage reflected back.","replies":[]}]}
