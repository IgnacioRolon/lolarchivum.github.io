Even though she was bronze, she was still easily doing 400 damage each crit, which was 65% of the time.  When she used her ability, though, her damage output seemed to drop dramatically, and I never saw damage over ~100 at a time.  Her ability simply says her basic attacks fire a flurry of arrows, which appear to do a set damage based on her AD, without mentioning that they can still crit.  \r\n\r\nSoo... can they still crit?","replies":[{"poster":"AlienPrimate","date":"2019-11-26T19:39:51.329+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Her damage numbers do go down when she uses her ability but you have to remember that she hits multiple times per shot for an increase in dps at a loss of big numbers.","replies":[{"poster":"Porglit","date":"2019-11-26T20:43:05.708+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=AlienPrimate,realm=NA,application-id=RaE1aOE7,discussion-id=Fk3l67OI,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2019-11-26T19:39:51.329+0000)\n>\n> Her damage numbers do go down when she uses her ability but you have to remember that she hits multiple times per shot for an increase in dps at a loss of big numbers.\n\nI recognize that, but I'm not sure if the flurry can crit like a normal auto can.  I wasn't seeing some numbers that were 4x the other numbers, though it was also hard to see, so I could have missed them.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sanitarium33","date":"2019-11-29T04:58:37.981+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ashe is a {{item:3087}}  champ.
