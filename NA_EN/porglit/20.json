The Devs keep saying they want us to be able to adapt to the situation, but there's no way to adapt to dodge since wild got removed.  There are two main areas this causes problems: \r\n\r\n1. Cloud element.  If people build a cloud duo and start on a cloud hex, they already have 35% dodge.  Throw on a single {{item:3025}}  and they dodge just over half of all autos, and there's no way to overcome the issue.  If they put another dodge item, they dodge 75%...\r\n\r\n2. Assassins (6) teams are worthless.  I've only seen a rare assassin (6) build, and they've never done well.  I recently decided to try them out myself and I found out why on one builds them: a SINGLE carry with {{item:3046}} renders your whole team worthless.  I've repeatedly seen someone's carry 1v5 my team because none of my attacks can hit... and there's no way to overcome the issue.  The opponent can adapt to my build by throwing a {{item:3046}} on their carry, but I can't adapt because they moved the assured hit effect from {{item:3094}} to the wild bonus, but then ditched wild in the new rotation.\r\n\r\nPlease add back the \"Attacks can not be dodged\" effect into {{item:3094}}","replies":[{"poster":"Porglit","date":"2019-11-16T16:30:14.623+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Most of these comments don't address the actual issue: Assassins have a gigantic, easily obtainable counter in {{item:3046}} , and there's no counterplay as assassins.  Abilities, magic damage, and Olaf are other options besides assassins, which is making my point all the more: NOT going assassins is the only way to avoid being shut down hard.  That's a lame mechanic, and is easily fixable by adding back in the assured hit on {{item:3094}} .","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kuponya","date":"2019-11-16T04:08:36.273+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Abilities can't be dodged.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TwitchInMyPants","date":"2019-11-16T07:55:17.635+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly running 6 Assassins outside of 1 meta was shitty in Set 1, it was never a good thing to have 6 squishy melee units clumping the same target as your whole main team.\n\nThree Assassins in Set 2 can definitely struggle.  If its a cloud board you should avoid Assassins like the plague.  I will say though if you're not on a cloud board even if there's a PD or Gauntlet on someone, its still worth building since your key unit is Zed.  He doesn't care if he can't crit when he gets to make clones, effectively means even he will definitely hit even if crits aren't viable.","replies":[]},{"poster":"FireDrizzle","date":"2019-11-16T05:40:05.263+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I didnt find cloud element useful and like warden bonus it does nothing vs the prevalent magic damage.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Smyrage","date":"2019-11-15T23:35:08.475+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We don't have Wild anymore, but we have Olaf.\n\nPersonally I like that assassins in this patch more. They can be fitted into more team compositions instead of going full assassins to make them oppressively good, because that was the only way in the previous patch.","replies":[]}]}
