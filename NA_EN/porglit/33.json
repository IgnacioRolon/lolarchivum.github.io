Half the time he jumps away from his target right before he could kill them, completely negating any targeting value.  Half the time he jumps away from the fight entirely, and pops up a couple hexes away, then has to wander back in.\r\n\r\nI literally had a game decided on the fact that my Rek sai was one auto from killing his last guy, Lucian (and me winning the whole match), but then Rek jumped into the ground and...   popped out two hexes away without touching him, giving him free hits that cost me the game???\r\n\r\nSeriously.\r\n\r\nI legit have never seen his ability land on a single unit that's worth it, and seen countless dozens of enemies get saved because Rek avoids killing them to wander off into the abyss for a couple seconds.  You know something is wrong when you ability helps your enemies....","replies":[{"poster":"Metal Janna","date":"2019-06-29T01:41:58.720+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I made a topic on this earlier.\nTFT Rek'sai's ability is terrible, and she sucks as a unit because of it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"preternatural","date":"2019-06-29T01:39:37.863+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{champion:421}} \nhe?\nhis?\nwhen did rek transitioned?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Saezio","date":"2019-06-29T01:48:22.309+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"SHE IS A QUEEN AND YOU WILL ADDRESS HER AS SUCH","replies":[]},{"poster":"Beerstein","date":"2019-06-29T01:53:35.441+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is kind of an issue with all champs/abilities tbh.
