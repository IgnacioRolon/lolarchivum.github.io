Most other insanely powerful comps have answers (level 6 sorc = ({{item:1057}} + {{item:1057}}), yordles = {{item:3094}} , assassins = {{item:3046}} ), but nothing reduces or negates glacial CC.   {{item:3139}} is the perfect answer.  It could have some percentage chance to ignore freezes and maybe stuns (leona is it right now, I think).  I'm not sure how it would interact with knockups, but I like the idea of them still hitting someone with {{item:3139}} .","replies":[{"poster":"SVPERUZER","date":"2019-07-10T23:07:17.364+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Or rather than a percentage have it insta negate the first stun per round...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pxerkza","date":"2019-07-10T22:32:33.674+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the counter to glacial is spreading out and positioning your carries away from the aoe\n\nalthough i like the idea i pretty much hate the pyke/ashe perma stuns","replies":[]}]}
