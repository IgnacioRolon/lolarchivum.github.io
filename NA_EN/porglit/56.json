Turns out, I had to get level 6 before the round 10 fight started.  This is counting the first three minions, which means this was stage 3-1, a full THREE STAGES before the second shared carousel, and also either 4 or 1 levels (depending on if the first minions count) before the \"clarification\" that it's round 11 (which only makes sense if you DON'T count the first three minion stages).\r\n\r\nEither that or Riot fixed the issue.  I hope it's the latter.","replies":[{"poster":"Critmaster Garen","date":"2019-07-11T19:00:49.695+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i got it on my first try, lol. maybe its because they patched it when i did, but i dont think it was difficult to get to 6 before the second draft.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ratpie","date":"2019-07-11T18:44:03.999+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I tried it so many times, and should have gotten in multiple times, but then got it one round when I wasn't even trying and wasn't even leveled by that level.
