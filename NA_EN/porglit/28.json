Also, there are occasionally people who are standing next to a frozen hex, yet have their AS reduced.\r\n\r\nIt's only about 80% of the time, but it's noticeable and happens frequently enough.","replies":[{"poster":"eXChristian","date":"2019-09-28T08:24:55.314+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The slow is so significant that if you have like 3 champs affected those three champs are completely useless cause they dont have enough time to generate any mana and have 0 ultimate used in round. The bug which I've found is that sometimes if a champs get the effect of slow from the gauntlet and aren't killed (not sure if are or arent now) they keep the effect of the gauntlet in next round as well. I lost a game terribly with 3 main champions completely useles standing there and using autoattack just 3 times cause they kept the overpowered effect from last game. So far I really don't like this new patch its a lot more random than it used to be, traits doesn' matter anymore much just make your goal of doing random champs to level 3 and take as much items as possible cause items are the power here now, I feel like strategy is gone in TFT.","replies":[]}]}
