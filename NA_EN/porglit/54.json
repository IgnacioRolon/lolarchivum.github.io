And does each gunslinger extra shot stack wild bonus?  With Graves, the gunslinger bonus makes him attack multiple times, instead of all at once... is it different for him?","replies":[{"poster":"TwitchInMyPants","date":"2019-10-18T00:07:34.392+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know that any extra attack will stack with wild bonus, but despite using bladeslinger a good amount I'm honestly not sure if its multiple chances to apply the AoE shot.  I'm going to assume yes though since its often a massive powerspike when you turn someone like Jinx or Lucian into a Blademaster, they're getting 40% attack speed and bonus strikes and they usually AoE a lot.  Most on-hits from what I can tell benefit from the bonus attack so it'd make sense if it works the same for Gunslinger, regardless if that's the case they're a good partner synergy because of Gangplank.","replies":[]}]}
