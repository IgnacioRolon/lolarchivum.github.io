(But I have fun, and seem to win about as often as anybody else does.)\n\nI try to bypass most of these issues with a single strategy. I build large teams with many synergies so that I'll be strong enough to avoid committing to equip most of my items until late game when I have my carries in place.\n\nHave to say, this worked much better in Set 1, where there were more offensive team ally buffs. (And less early damage.) I have finally worked out a method, a kind of mini-game. However, with this strategy, I'm still much better off getting the item drops later in the game, and the cash drops earlier. (Since I only want to equip one or two key items early.)","replies":[]},{"poster":"True Garen","date":"2019-12-18T22:52:35.068+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Heroboy10,realm=EUNE,application-id=RaE1aOE7,discussion-id=h6wBAJET,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2019-12-18T12:02:43.148+0000)\n>\n> Not in this case.

Unfortunately, that's ridiculous. But that's about how it works. \n\nThis is a game of chance.\n\nNo single match of TFT, is balanced. The law of averages would tend to balance it for any individual player, across dozens of matches. It's as if each entire match of TFT was the equivalent of a single hand of poker or blackjack. (This is the silliest part of the game: that a game that operates on these principles takes so long to complete.) No sIngle hand of cards is balanced, but the odds are that across 20 or 40 hands they will be. And similar for TFT.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"True Garen","date":"2019-12-16T23:28:08.076+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeah, this actually happens, occasionally.\n\n(Your bench was probably full besides; what difference does it make?)\n\nIt does seem that all players receive the same number of components by Raptors or the carousel after, plus/minus one, maybe.
