However, it leaves a number of important details out.  Wardens, Druids, and any defensive front-liner will appear worthless, because their contribution is based on how much damage is done to them, instead of how much damage they dish out.\r\n\r\n**Suggestion: ** Add a couple tabs for damage taken, and/or damage healed/shielded.  This would give us a better understanding of the overall contribution of each unit better.  =)","replies":[]}
