That said I actually like Nobles more than I do Hextech because at least you'll probably get fought for on Kayle / Lucian (and it can be knockup cheesed) --- Hextech meanwhile needs its duration lowered at Rank 1 and Jinx to get some scaling back so people aren't just cramming her and Draven into whatever the fuck.","replies":[]},{"poster":"hrooza dota ","date":"2019-08-26T02:45:33.974+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hextech is only used as a tech to other comps as 2 champs, and imo the buff is balanced its just that other buffs are good already and would not mind a free decent buff as a tech [also jinx is pretty op]","replies":[]},{"poster":"Louie Kaboom","date":"2019-08-25T21:55:36.427+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"why would you go 4 hextechs?  lmao, just get vi and jinx gg","replies":[]},{"poster":"Katalyst24","date":"2019-08-25T21:51:21.055+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"2 hextech is useful to counter the \"single carry champion\" idea.
