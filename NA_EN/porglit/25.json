In one sense this is true, as they can still attack or cast spells, but simply can't move.  However, if Camille is moved or dies during this \"root\", the target is unable to attack or cast their spell on anyone else during the duration of the \"root\".  This makes it much closer to a taunt than a root, because a rooted target should still be able to attack anyone that's in range throughout the duration.\r\n\r\nI suggest either fixing the tooltip or fixing the mechanic to better fit what is currently stated.","replies":[]}
