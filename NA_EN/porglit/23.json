From my placement, I was expecting to be released into the carousel on the second wave, but it released me and 8th on the first round, and \"7th\" place was released on the second round.\r\n\r\nI've observed this bug a number of time.  It seem that whenever you're tied, it places you at the top of the tie, despite your \"actual\" rank.  Needless to say, this is confusing and should be changed.","replies":[{"poster":"Porglit","date":"2019-08-31T13:02:45.155+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was also thinking it could be that whoever got down to that HP first was put in the lower position.  I know when two people die in the same round, it's time-sensitive to whoever died first, so I can see that as also being how ranking ties works.\n\nI haven't been paying close enough attention to test that theory, though, so don't quote me on it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LordRedStone Nr1","date":"2019-08-31T08:22:39.789+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"On your screen, you are always placed on top if you are tied. This can easily be observed in the minion rounds, where everyone has 100 HP but you always end up on top.\n\nFor the carousel, I'm not sure what determines the release order in these special cases (it's only a problem if you are tied across tiers, 7th and 8th place get released at the same time anyway so it wouldn't matter if they were tied). \n\nIt could be based on the internal ordering from the server (Hashcodes and/or matchmaking), but that would mean a certain player in a certain match would always lose if tied. That doesn't seem like good design for me.\n\nAnother option is that it's random. So you have a 50% chance to come out on top (like your screen would say anyway), but also a 50% chance that the enemy wins and you get the lower position aka an earlier release assigned even if you think you are placed above the enemy.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheMegaBeaver","date":"2019-08-31T07:46:42.167+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe it goes by the result of the previous round?
