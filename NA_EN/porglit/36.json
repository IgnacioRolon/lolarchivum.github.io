Rather than getting absolutely non interestuntil you get 10, and then no difference until you get a whole other 10, every single gold would have at least some effect.  15 gold would give you 1.5 interest, but 17 would give you 1.7.  This would introduce a constant trade-off for your bench, where you have to decide to either keep random champs to increase your chance of upgrading them or allowing you to switch comps, OR you could sell them immediately for increased gold directly and immediately proportional to their worth.  I think it would be more intriguing that way.\n\nAlso, win/loss streaks could be smoothed out.","replies":[]}
