I propose the following: disable X items for X seconds, where X is the number of hextech units you have.  \r\n\r\nRationale: the beginning of the match is in many ways the most important.  Killing anyone early makes a gigantic difference, and getting an advantage right at the start is likewise critical for creating a lead that will carry you through the rest of the fight (this is why tears are actually useful; even just getting your spells out a little bit sooner and win you a losing battle).  Because the early match is so important, you don't need FIFTEEN SECONDS of disables.  4 seconds on 4 items is more than enough to make a MAJOR difference.\r\n\r\nAlso, this adds a cool aspect where any number of hextech champs helps, instead of only benefitting at certain breaks.","replies":[{"poster":"Toadwart","date":"2019-08-02T17:23:05.317+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I dont want to see items disabled for any amount of seconds.
