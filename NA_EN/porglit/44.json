It's usually not the hexes themselves that I can't see, but the camera is lowered in such a way that I can't see the opponent's health bar or level when they're standing on their platform.  I even manually walk to the very top of the board hoping the screen will shift up enough to see, but it doesn't.  I'm stuck counting the units they have on the board to determine their level.\n\nMore than that, it also cuts off the items and healthbars of the top row of their units.  I have no ability to see if someone is stacked with 3 items or has 0, and can only sometimes even see the heads of the champs.  This also happens in both the planning phase and when actively fighting them.","replies":[{"poster":"True Garen","date":"2019-11-15T12:38:50.644+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I find this annoying as well.
