After a couple dozen games, I wanted to give my feedback on the champ I've tested, but the PBE forums say I can't post because I'm \"in the wrong region\".  There is no option to change regions that I can find.\r\n\r\nDoes that honestly mean I can't contribute my feedback because I live in NA?  What am I missing here??","replies":[{"poster":"Son Golin","date":"2019-05-24T00:01:27.588+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Porglit,\n\nSorry for the confusion, the PBE Boards is a little odd in how it interacts with the rest of the region Boards. It's seen as it's own \"region\" in some ways, but isn't in other ways. \n\nEssentially it's determining that you're trying post from the NA \"region\" on the PBE \"region\" Boards. So you just need to log off of your NA account, go to the PBE Boards and sign into your PBE Boards.\n\nThe opposite is true, if you wanted to post on the NA Boards again, you'll need to log out of your PBE account and log back into your NA account.","replies":[{"poster":"Porglit","date":"2019-05-24T01:39:38.216+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Works perfectly when I do as you say.
