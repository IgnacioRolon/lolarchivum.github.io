When the \"claim\" button is grayed out (while waiting for a new orb), it says that we can play \"up to 5 games\" to increase the progress.\r\n\r\n**My question is: Can you over-play one day and have the extra games carry over to the next?**  So if I play 8 games in one day, and then claim my orb, are there 3 games already counted toward my next orb?  And if this is the way it works, can this go indefinitely?  Can I play 20 games, and have the next 4 orbs completely \"charged\"?","replies":[]}
