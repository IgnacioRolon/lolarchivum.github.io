I agree with them all.  I think one way to fix all these issues would be to make the damage based on the health remaining, rather than the number of units left.  The higher tier units naturally have more health, so they would do more damage similar to how it works now (though not if they're almost dead).  Balancing would be very easy: if 300 health per damage is too much, for example, it's easy to tweak to 350 health per damage.\r\n\r\nThis would allow the game to go a little bit longer, and also be a more accurate representation of what happened in the battle.  Having 4 champs left with 100 health each shouldn't do as much damage as 4 champs with full health, and this would fix that as well.\r\n\r\nMy two cents.","replies":[{"poster":"Panthaz89","date":"2019-07-02T03:01:56.043+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even with a longer game you are probably going to see lvl 3 cost 5 champ maybe every 1k games. 4 cost units aren't near impossible even now and isn't that unlikely to happen though its rare.

I've played dozens upon dozens of games, and never once been in a game with a level 3 tier 4 champ, and only a couple times ever seen someone get to level 9.  Rift herald is surprisingly rare as well, though certainly more common than what I've already mentioned.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Saezio","date":"2019-07-02T07:01:27.782+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"NONONO\n\nThis would mean high HP compositions do more damage than high damage comps.\n\n%HP left would be more appropriate.

Brawlers are awful right now, so you often end up losing your high health because you don't kill them in time to save it.\n\nThough % health is probably a better idea anyway, so that's a good point.","replies":[]}]}]}
