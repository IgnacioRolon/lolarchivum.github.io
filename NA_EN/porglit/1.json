First game in the league I won, and it gave me +22 LP.  However, it said the resulting LP was only 19??  I looked up ways LP could be lost and found that queue dodging loses 3, but that didn&#039;t make sense because I&#039;d never dodged a queue this season, although someone on my team had before I started that game.  Without thinking too much of it, I played another game and lost -17, bringing me down to 2.  My next game, someone queue dodged again, then I won +21, but resulted in 21 LP...\r\n\r\nDo I personally lose 3 LP when someone else on my team queue dodges?  If not, where the heck is all my LP going??","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-08-30T02:26:22.687+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You do not start at 0 LP after the promo game, you probably had 2 LP over the 100 needed to qualify for the series.\n\n..I misread that completely.\n\nReally good question 0-o","replies":[]}]}
