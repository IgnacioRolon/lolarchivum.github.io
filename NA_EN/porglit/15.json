I only had 5 left, so I did the only thing I could with them: make them into blue essence.  The problem is that it took forever and was unnecessarily tedious for a number of reasons...\r\n\r\n1.  Each time I clicked on the tokens, the list of things I could buy always started at the very top.  This gets a little old, because there are twelve rows to scroll through before I get to the bottom.  This makes perfect sense for the first time I click on them (each time I client), but I'll get back to why this is an issue.\r\n\r\n2. When I try to convert my tokens to essence, there is ONLY an option to spend a single token to get 10 essence.  Thankfully I had only 5 tokens, so I didn't go crazy, but that means I had to take 5 separate actions to transfer my tokens to blue essence.\r\n\r\n3. The tokens don't actually give me blue essence (even though that's what I'm buying), they only give me a blue essence token that I can open for blue essence.  This means I have to go through the entire process of opening things twice per token, instead of just once.\r\n\r\nI know this might seem like a small thing to complain about, but let me break it down.  Combining points 1 and 2, I had to click the tokens, scroll down 12 rows, click on the blue essence icon, wait for the special effects, click the \"forge\" button, wait for the special effects telling me what I just bought, click ok, then click the tokens, scroll down 12 rows, click on the blue essence icon, wait for the special effects, click the \"forge\" button, wait for the special effects telling me what I just bought, click ok... and that's just 2 of the 5.  BUT WAIT THERE'S MORE!  After this, I could only open one or ten blue essences at a time, of the 50 I bought.  So I had to go through another process of clicking the blue essence, waiting for the special effects, open only 10, wait for the special effects, click \"ok\" for getting the blue essence from the blue essence tokens I bought with the tokens, and then also repeat THAT process 5 times.\r\n\r\nI don't need any more key fragments, so just imagine if I had 40 tokens, instead of only 5....... \r\n\r\n------------------\r\n\r\nThe main issue I see here is that it's a ton of inconvenience when there's two simple fixes:\r\n\r\n1. Make it so that after you click what you want to buy (and the special effects make it look cool), there's a an option next to the cost to increase the number of times you want to forge.  Rather than repeating the same action 40 times, I just click the up arrow 39 times and forge all 40 at once (or type in a number, or something, really anything).\r\n\r\n2. Make the blue essence able to be opened all at once.  Opening 1 or 10 is cool (unless you have more than that), but there should also be a \"open all\" option.  Either that, or make it so that if you buy blue essence with tokens, you simply get blue essence (rather than buying something that you then have to open to get what you paid for...??).\r\n\r\nIf these two simple fixes were implemented, I could easily open 40 tokens in 5 seconds total, rather than needing 10 seconds PER token to actually get the blue essence.","replies":[]}
