When I place it on someone with very low mana (Yas, Akali, or Lucian with a Seraph's), it only procs maybe every 2 or 3 spells.  If they cast slower, it procs every single spell.  Is this from a CD on Luden's, or is it a bug, or what?","replies":[{"poster":"Cr√§fty","date":"2019-08-27T17:19:52.265+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"A lot of mechanics in the game involve a 1 sec internal CD, so maybe {{item:3285}} is no different.\n\nI know of 2 of those mechanics:\n\n* Units maintain aggro on their current target for 1 sec, after it goes out their attack range, before they focus a new target. That's why if your {{champion:53}}, on the other side of the board, hooks a champ that your unit are focusing, your units will follow that grabbed target for 1 sec before focusing the nearest enemy available. Or if an Assassin is attacking {{champion:236}} and he dashes away, the assassin will follow lucian for 1 sec before targeting the nearest enemy in attack range, etc.\n\n* {{item:3040}} and {{item:3161}} won't give your unit mana for 1 sec after they cast their spells. That's why sometimes you see units like {{champion:236}} and {{champion:84}} not gaining mana immediately after casting a spell, even though they're attacking a unit.\n\nAlso, keep in mind that {{item:3285}} will hit only the current target, and no one else, if the the current target of the Luden's holder is more than 1 hex away from his teammates! So the dmg will be done to the current target only and you won't see the splash damage animation of Luden's.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sire Hippington","date":"2019-08-27T17:15:25.688+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pretty sure it has a CD","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porglit","date":"2019-08-27T22:02:48.318+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's all very helpful.
