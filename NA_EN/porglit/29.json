AFKs no longer ruin games.**  People can drop out, but everything goes on as normal.  This especially makes a difference for lower rated players who run into an AFK every other game.\n\n**2. Lag hardly matters.**  For people playing on toasters, this means everything.  The carousel is the only part you need to not lag on, as the planning phase is long enough to accommodate for lag, and you just watch the rest.\n\n**3. Much less concentration needed.**  You aren't glued to the screen requiring intense concentration for 35 minutes straight.  If you have anything else going on at all, it's easy to weave inbetween rounds.  I've done laundry, read books or articles, worked out, and made dinner between rounds.  The relaxed change of pace is wonderful and forgiving.\n\n**4. SOO much less toxic.**  In ~100 games, I've maybe seen 3 toxic people make a couple comments each.  Enough said.\n\n----------------------\n\n\nAs much hate as this gamemode gets, I think these benefits should at least be mentioned.  {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]}
