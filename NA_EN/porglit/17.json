I suggest solutions to both:\r\n\r\n1. Hextech as a concept has been raged against from the very beginning, and for good reason.  EVERYONE and their cat knows that the game is dominated by items, and having a synergy that deletes that aspect of the game is garbage.  Shortening the length is very very tricky, because the beginning of the match is by far the most important, so I instead suggest: **Either have the effect kill the bonus stats but keep the special effects, or kill the effects but keep the bonus stats.**  Either one would nerf the obviously OP ability, but still allow people to recognize that their carries are still their carries.\r\n\r\n2. As the champion pool increases in number, it becomes harder to find the champs that fit your build (regardless of whatever build you're playing at any point during the game).  To fix this, **we should get 6 slots every roll, instead of only 5**.  That may be overkill right now, but if they add a couple champs next patch, it will average out pretty well.  It might also be necessary to extend the bench by another 1-2, to allow for more options to be left open simply because there are more options in the game all-together.  This idea is also expandable: if they make even more champs, they can easily add more room to the bench or even 7 per roll.\r\n\r\nThere's my thoughts, take them or leave them.","replies":[]}
