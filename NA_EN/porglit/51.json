No other spatula items double the base stats, so I'm certain it's supposed to be only 10% for each.  What more, the person you put it on will only have 35% crit (no way to check the dodge), so it looks like it's only the tooltip that's false, and the actual effect is as intended.  Small tweak, but I've noticed it ever since Set 2 was released on PBE.","replies":[]}
