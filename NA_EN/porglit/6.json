But there's a respectful way to go about saying it, and \"**** *****ing ******* riot ******** *** ****ing **** ***\" isn't it.  If only for selfish reasons alone, calm down.  You're more likely to be listened to if you're respectful, so you're shooting yourself in the foot with all the insults.\r\n\r\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-clap}}","replies":[{"poster":"XinZhao2WinNhao","date":"2019-08-17T22:40:47.098+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're right.\n\nIt's fair for customers to complain about aspects of a game if they're not working and we should criticize Riot as a company for some bad business practices like the eggs being basically gambling, but we need to remember that individual Rioters are people too.\n\nNot all Rioters are swimming in money, not all Rioters are the people who own the company and get to make major decisions on all its business practices (for example, the balance team is probably not the ones who decide how much money to charge for skins), many Rioters are normal people who are working a 9-5.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Arcade Lulu","date":"2019-08-17T22:16:21.820+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Can Riot stop doing dumb shit?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shiroe Okazaki","date":"2019-08-17T22:11:44.534+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"People insult riot because they don't even communicate with us. The last time i seen a rioter on the boards was someone who designed skins or the lore. The ones who code and balance don't really come here often. aside from that they ignore what the community wants and hardly even say why. Like we don't want all this damage and true damage. But then riot nerfed utility which in turn buffs damage again.\nI really could be wrong but this is mostly what i hear about when people hate on riot. IMO i hate the people who code stuff and the balance team. I love the lore and skin team. Like really love the skin team.","replies":[]},{"poster":"VAPOR33","date":"2019-08-18T23:37:17.417+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"No, simple answer. Riot creates it's own problems by not listening to it's regular fucking players. They seem to 1 up themselves every week by fucking up patches, new champ rollouts, ability buffs/nerfs....pretty much anything they touch gets fucked up. Your band of \"riot cheerleaders\" does nothing but encourage the dumbfuckery.","replies":[]},{"poster":"enshine","date":"2019-08-17T21:50:40.585+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"who the fuck censors themselves on the internet lmao","replies":[]}]}
