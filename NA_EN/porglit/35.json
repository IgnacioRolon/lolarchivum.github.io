However, there are a couple other considerations (reliability and items) to think about when evaluating the change.**  Let's break it down.\n\n**1. Identical expected damage.**  By \"expected\" damage, I mean the average output over a long period of time.  RNG will make your actual damage output either more or less in an actual fight due to the limited number of autos per round.  Currently, crit damage increase is additive instead of multiplicative.  There's a base crit of 25% and crit damage of 150%.  This means your total expected damage output for standard attack, the old assassin synergy, and the new synergy is expected to be:\n\n**Example** = **total expected damage multiplier** = (chance of base damage X base damage) + (chance of crit X crit damage multiplier)\n\n**Normal auto attacks** = **1.125** = (.75 x 1) + (.25 x 1.5)\n\n**Old (3)** = **1.4375** = (.75 x 1) + (.25 x 2.75)\n**Old (6)** = **2** = (.75 x 1) + (.25 x 5)\n\n**New (3)** = **1.4375** = (.65 x 1) + (.35 x 2.25)\n**New (6)** = **2** = (.5 x 1) = (.5 x 3)\n\nThis means when considering your base chance and strength of crits, your normal autos are expected to have a 12.5% increase in damage compared to no crit chance at all.  Every champion in the game (currently) has this as their base.  Adjusting for this, an Assassin 3 synergy bonus is a 28% increase in damage compared to normal champs, and an Assassin 6 bonus has a 78% increase.  **The total expected damage output for the old and new synergy is identical.**\n\n**2. Consistency.**  This one is hard to put a numerical advantage to, because it depends on RNG and the specific situation.  However, the easiest way to think about it is this: you don't want to overkill your target.  Any damage dealt more than their health is \"wasted\" damage that you \"could\" have been dealing to the next victim.  The change from lower damage per crit, but more crits, makes it so that you are much less likely to overkill, and you overkill by less.  **This is a slight buff.**\n\n**3. Items.**  There are currently three items that affect crit directly: {{item:3031}}, and {{item:3131}}, and {{item:3046}}.  \n\n{{item:3031}} is better for the new synergy, because it's already more likely that the old crits overkill the target.  From a consistency standpoint, it's more likely that the new assassins will be able to utilize but not waste the extra damage.  More than that, though, a higher crit chance means this item applies its bonus damage more often.  **This is a reasonable buff.**\n\n{{item:3131}} changes the calculations of the damage output.  The new damage calculations after the item kicks in are simply the crit damages, and we compare them to the 1.5 natural crit damage for a base champion:\n\nNormal crit attacks: 1.5\n**Old (3)** = **83%** increase, or (2.75/1.5) - 1\n**Old (6)** = **233%** increase, or (5.00/1.5) - 1\n\n**New (3)** = **50%** increase, or (2.25/1.5) - 1\n**New (6)** = **100%** increase, or (3.00/1.5) - 1\nThe numbers are super clear: A new assassin with {{item:3131}} is shockingly worse than an old assassin.  Comparing these numbers, {{item:3131}} got a **27% nerf** with assassin (3), and a **57% nerf** with assassin (6).\n\n\n{{item:3046}} was already a shutdown against assassins, but it's even more so now.  Again the calculations change, but the exact opposite way, where we're left with only the base auto chance multiplied by 1.  This give us:\n\n**Normal** Auto attacks = **33%** decrease in total expected damage, or 1 / (.75/1.125)\n\n**Old (3)** = **48%** decrease, or 1 - (1 / (.75/1.4375))\n**Old (6)** = **63%** decrease, or 1 - (1 / (.75/2))\n\n**New (3)** = **65%** decrease, or 1 - (1 / (.5/1.4375))\n**New (6)** = **75%** decrease, or 1 - (1 / (.5/2))\n\nIn short, it used to be that {{item:3046}} cut your damage either ~1/2 or ~2/3, but now it's either ~2/3 or ~3/4.  Comparing these comparisons, a {{item:3046}} got a **36% buff** against assassin (3), and got a **20% buff** against assassin (6).  However much of a shutdown item it was before, it's even more so now.\n\n-----------------------\n\n**TL;DR:** Total expected damage is identical, but reliability is up (slight buff).  {{item:3031}} is likewise better, but {{item:3131}} got a **27% nerf** with (3) and **57% nerf** with (6), and {{item:3046}} got a **36% buff** against (3) and **20% buff** against (6).  **In short, the damage may be identical, but assassins are harder to build, and easier to build against.**","replies":[{"poster":"La Belle Sauvage","date":"2019-08-30T18:01:01.977+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I love these type of posts!

Rengar will be capable of 100% Crit, and Akali will have a Crit Skill.\n\nFurthermore, there's a new item that makes abilities Crit, so Assassins like Zed, Katarina, etc, who rely on their skill to put on a lead (especially Zed with Ninja) will be able to stack his Crit onto his ability and use Ninja/Assassin to amp his skill up to a 1300+ damage aoe.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porglit","date":"2019-08-30T21:03:03.702+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I didn't forget burst, I just think it's better to have consistency.  It's better to have double the chance of critting for half the damage than it is to have a small chance of overkilling.  What's the point of having 1/4 chance of doing 1500 to a 1000 health unit, when you could have a 1/2 chance of guaranteeing you kill them by the second auto?  \n\nApplying a more reasonable amount of damage more often will help you finish off weak champions far more effectively.  For squishies that die in one crit, you'll also be able to more consistently kill them quickly, rather than praying for a 1/4 chance.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sire Hippington","date":"2019-08-30T20:06:48.220+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think you left one important part out of the comparsion: Burst\nNew assasins are more reliable, but old would have a higher potential to burst down a pice and prevent it from impacting the rest of the fight.\nA lvl 3 Zed befor could kill most lvl 2 backliners with a single crit, now that potential is gone.\n\nThough anyway, Assasins will never be a comp that gets top 2 as long as {{item:3046}} doesn't get changed, it just shuts them down to hard.\nThrow in the current rise of yordles and guardians and full assasins just are easily the worst comp right now.","replies":[]}]}
