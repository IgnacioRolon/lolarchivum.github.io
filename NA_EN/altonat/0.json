Yeah. That was the SSG skin that Crown had to LITERALLY PICK before Riot finally gave her something. There's tons of Star Guardian Taliyah fanart, ready for Riot to just pick up and use. But no. Neeko gets two. What the fuck.\n\nInteresting post to downvote. Salty about Taliyah much, two people?\n\nOh 5! I didn't know so many people hated Taliyah!\n\n7! 7 people hate Taliyah! Phew. That's random!\n\n9! 9 people hate Taliyah for some reason! I'm like the Count from Sesame Street. \n\nAh ah ah ah aaaahhhhhh\n\n11! Ah ah ah ah aaaahhhhhh","replies":[]}
