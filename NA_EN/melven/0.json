That seems wrong since other summoners can call me a plethroa of names... why can another player call me and i quote \" a fucking idiot\" or \"garbage\" but i cant call rioter that? Seems like preferntial treatment on the side of Riot, but hey if we wnat to play their game we have to pay them: right????? (not like certain skins have better VGU)","replies":[{"poster":"Evangele","date":"2019-12-13T17:12:36.246+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:267}} Well as fun as this was, I'm going to lock this guy up.

In order to share with the community you would need to do one of the following:\n\n1. Copy and paste the tickets and responses.\n\n2. Screenshot and share via image hosting.\n\nAs a rule of thumb, if you treat people who can help you like shit; they become less likely to help you. The customer is always right is not a truth. Businesses have the right to deny service in most cases.\n\nIf others are harassing you in game, you can mute in game and then report post game.\n\nAnd just to go ahead and clear up a misconception. My blue name does not mean I work for Riot. I am just a community member like any other poster.","replies":[{"poster":"Melven","date":"2019-12-13T03:36:38.574+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":7,"body":"I don't think u understand the point; its okay","replies":[{"poster":"Melven","date":"2019-12-13T03:37:05.175+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":7,"body":"this is exactly what im talking about","replies":[{"poster":"OneMustFall","date":"2019-12-13T03:47:07.333+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Melven,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=yuEJGbal,comment-id=000300000000,timestamp=2019-12-13T03:37:05.175+0000)\n>\n> this is exactly what im talking about\n\nAre you ok?","replies":[{"poster":"Melven","date":"2019-12-13T05:08:58.704+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"are you? im not I got chat restricted for saying a word that does not exist in the English or any other languages dictionary...","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Periscope","date":"2019-12-13T08:18:33.493+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"The point of his comment was to instruct you in how to use these forums.
