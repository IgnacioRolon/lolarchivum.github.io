So I do not want people to be negative here at all, instead you can participate and do your own fun little ideas, this is supposed to be a forum anyways.\n\nIf you do not like one of my ideas then let me know what it is, exactly what it is, and be helpful to give your own ideas to help improve the post. Proper participation makes this more fun, but I really like Annie's cinematic that she has and wanted to get creative with it and try making an ability kit that more closely resembles that type of Annie a bit better.\n\n****\n\n> **Basic Attack Range:** 600 units\n> **Attack Speed:** 0.645 +3% per level\n> **Movement:** 335 units per second\n> \n> ****\n> \n> **Tibbers the Protector (Passive):** Leash Range: 600 units\n> If Annie is below 40% health then Tibbers transforms and grows to massive proportions, attacking the closest enemy or prioritizing champions that last attacked Annie, dealing 40 - 100 plus 6%(+2% per 100AP) of the target's missing health as magic damage per attack. Tibbers returns to his normal teddy bear state if Annie's health is above 40%, but he will linger on for 3 seconds before dying if Annie dies, gaining 100% bonus attack speed and movement speed against Annie's killer freely.\n> \n> _She Tries to Help:_  Annie can basic attack allied champions, she will either heal the target for 20 - 120 (+80%AP) health or apply grievous wounds for 4 seconds against it, she can basic attack the same allied champion once every 6 seconds. If the target took champion or epic monster damage in the last 1.5 seconds then this always heals the target.\n> \n> **Incinerate (Q):** Cooldown: 2.5 seconds; Cost: 35/40/45/50/55 mana; Range: 650 units\n> Passive: The last champion that damaged Annie is trying to take Tibbers away! For the next 6 seconds against this target Incinerate deals 50% increased damage.\n> \n> Active: Annie zaps the target enemy with fire, dealing 50/75/100/125/150(+70%AP) magic damage, 75/112.5/150/187.5/225(+105%AP) magic damage against the last champion that damaged Annie and against minions/monsters.\n> \n> Incinerate's cooldown and mana cost is restored if this executes its target.\n> \n> **STOP IT! (W):** Cooldown: 9 seconds; Cost: 80/90/100/110/120 mana; Range: 600 units\n> Passive: Annie's other ability casts, attacking an allied champion, and whenever she takes champion or epic monster damage, grants her a stack of Pyromania, up to 10 stacks of Pyromania. Annie gains 4 stacks of Pyromania if she damages an enemy trying to take Tibbers away with Incinerate. Annie also gains 5 stacks of Pyromania and STOP IT!'s cooldown is refunded whenever Tibbers is initially summoned.\n> \n> Active: Annie becomes so frustrated to the point that she lets out powerful flames around her, consuming all Pyromania stacks and dealing 80/120/160/200/240(+90%AP) magic damage against struck enemies. If 10 stacks of Pyromania are consumed then struck enemies are also stunned for 1.5/1.75/2/2.25/2.5 seconds.\n> \n> _No Cheap Shots:_ STOP IT! goes on cooldown for 1 second if Annie uses Flash.\n> \n> **Fiery Sorrow (E):** Cooldown: 6 seconds; Cost: 16/22/28/34/40 mana per second; Range: 900 / 450 units\n> Toggle: Annie becomes frightened and creates a fiery aura around here, protecting herself and keeping others away, gaining 10% plus 6/7/8/9/10% damage reduction for every nearby enemy champion around her and dealing 40/60/80/100/120(+30%AP) magic damage per second against enemies even closer to her.\n> \n> **Through The Flames (R):** Cooldown: 120/100/80 seconds; Cost: 100 mana\n> Annie's entire body turns into flames for 3 seconds, converting all pre-mitigated damage against her to 40/90/140% healing and granting herself 70/80/90%(+20% per 100AP) increased movement speed, but Annie cannot attack or use her abilities during this time.\n> \n> Upon casting Through The Flames, Tibbers is summoned for 7/8/9 seconds regardless of Annie's current health.\n>\n> _(Fiery Sorrow automatically deactivates upon casting Through The Flames.)_\n\n****\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"SalamencÄ™","date":"2018-03-11T19:16:26.787+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's gotta be the single most broken concept I've ever seen. The abilities are cool though, but the numbers are fucked lol.","replies":[{"poster":"Stacona","date":"2018-03-11T19:59:13.741+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You want a short range mage to not deal any damage and never be able to kill anything?\n\nAlso the ultimate effect is she takes damage like normal, but she is healing for the pre-mitigated damage dealt to her as well. So it starts out as a lower damage reduction or very weak damage reduction varying on grievous wounds on her or not, rank 2 should feel like taking no damage or moderate damage reduction with grievous wounds, and rank 3 should be a self heal with taking hits or a very strong damage reduction with grievous wounds.\n\nThe other part of the ultimate allows her to have a way in and get off her damage on a controlled long cooldown moment of power and makes it so we can forcefully remove Flash synergy so that she is not overpowered with Flash and not useless without it.\n\n****\n\nEverything else is her upfront burst is slightly lower, unless under the specific situation of using your W and then dropping below 35% health for Tibbers and refund on W cooldown for W+W action, but this is a very high-risk and high-reward scenario due to being low on health, and Tibbers can only move freely within Annie's attack range (unless she dies which then grants Tibbers a few seconds to potentially get a revenge kill with unlimited range of movement). Other part is her surprise burst I wanted to nerf to give fairness and proper counter play for the opponent, so now her high Q damage is only when she attacks the last champion that attack her with it, the always high damage vs minions/monsters to have it easier to last hit with for the reward mechanic.\n\nAnd remove her thornmail effect and distribute it through-out her kit in a proper active form, like attacking Annie causes the Q to deal 50% more damage and helps her charge her stun faster, rather than free passive damage that requires no effort. And on the E itself the damage reduction is still easy to pull off, but now varies based on how aggressive you are and a lot stronger when Annie teamfights rather than skirmishes, while the damage is a lot more controlled and obvious AoE in very close range to Annie which the purpose to this is to try to get melee champions away from her and if not then at least she is pumping out more damage to the enemy tankline and divers (as long as she can upkeep the mana cost for that).","replies":[{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2018-03-12T06:52:28.445+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is her E automatically turned off during R?  Otherwise that will be too op.\n\nThe other part that seems a bit much to me is her healing on allies.  An 80% AP scaling heal is incredibly powerful.\n\nI think it is an interesting experiment, but the end result just doesn't work too well for this game.  If anything, I think she'd be played support to keep healing her adc in lane, she's tanky enough that she can work as a front liner, and the % missing hp damage on Tibbers means she'll still do some damage even on a support's budget.","replies":[{"poster":"Stacona","date":"2018-03-12T18:40:29.232+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Her E turns off and goes on cooldown when you activate R if E was active, only damage you can deal during your ult is from Tibbers directly. The base values are low for high AP ratios, keeps her building squishy, that includes her heal.\n\nIn terms of her heal balance, there are multiple different ways to balance it outside of adding a skill mechanic like always heals right after taking champion damage. Like every successful heal decreases in chance of occurring the next time, meaning the grievous wounds debuff chance increases, or you can have the healing chance much lower in the early game and increases in chance as the game goes on to keep early game sustain down.\n\nIn terms of roles, this supports both support and middle lane nicely, actually supports middle lane a lot better than where Annie is now.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"LSmaster16","date":"2018-03-12T12:04:56.802+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think they'd do something like this since it changes Annie's playstyle quite a bit while also making it a lot more complicated but in terms of fitting lore and personality this seems really cool.","replies":[{"poster":"Stacona","date":"2018-03-12T18:05:07.539+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Annie does need a rework though, and this does not change her drastically since she is still a high-damage, short range mage with a powerful stun and has a summon named Tibbers. Plus offering an engage tool on her ultimate while removing Flash to force proper control for future balancing and have proper counter play / response to what Annie is doing is a lot healthier gameplay and make Annie feel a lot better to play.\n\nI think this makes Annie a whole lot more interesting to play as while keep her general gameplay intact in a healthier way.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Reiizm","date":"2018-03-11T19:19:12.458+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cool concept. \"STOP IT!\" made me laugh.
