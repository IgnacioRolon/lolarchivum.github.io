Infinite and easy lane sustain\n2. Too hard scaling, where assassins (especially snowballing) refill tons of life because they are burst oriented.\n\n###Solution: Spell Vamp as a Flat Heal\n\nBy moving to a flat amount that doesn't scale with ability damage, we have a universal lever for tuning it to all champions simultaneously.  We can introduce interesting mechanics on this lever for balance.\n\n* Implement a cooldown on spell vamp procs so that champions with low cooldown abilities aren't given an unfair advantage, like Ezreal's Mystic Shot\n* Complement this cooldown with a charge mechanic, where every second unused, the next spell vamp proc charges up to a cap\n\nThe charge mechanic in particular could utilize interesting mechanics to balance the risk vs. reward of sustain in lane as well as limiting its burst potential on assassins--eg. charges are gained by damaging the enemy w/ autoattacks and/or abilities.\n\nThe flat amount can then be tuned to a reasonable level early game; the scaling via AP/AD ratio can be easily tuned to control its develop into the mid/late game.  Furthermore, by adding in an AD ratio, we can open the door to spell vamp on AD casters.  The itemization doesn't currently exist (no specialized AD + Spell vamp item), but through masteries and runes, it may provide for interesting laning and scaling possibilities for underutilized AD casters that could be worth exploring.\n\n###Goals\n\nPushing for spell vamp viability opens the door for new lane dynamics as well as late game scaling.  Currently, there is a heavy emphasis on the ability to bully in lane.  It may be that non lane bullies stand to benefit more from a system for sustaining through lane bully harass.  Spell vamp can be a tool to compete in lane with the likes of Orianna, Xerath, Lulu, or Zed. \n\nLate game scaling can be set arbitrarily high or low, but may in particular be most helpful to melee casters like Mordekaiser who could benefit from a way to sustain through heavy fire without entirely compromising their offensive item build.  My instinct says that without complementary changes, its potential to selectively empower champions who need it in the late game is likely small, so scaling should be minimized to avoid inadvertently buffing champions who *don't* need it. \n\n###Summary\n\nMoving spell vamp to flat health...\n\n* provides a lever independent of ability damage, which makes it much easier to tune across all champions at once.\n\nWhich accomplishes the following goals:\n\n* Giving champions who aren't lane bullies a way to sustain against other lane bullies, expanding the list of viable caster champions.\n* Places spell vamp in a healthier and easier to balance position, which could be a springboard for future changes that, for example, may assist melee casters in the mid/late game who are typically at risk of being blown up.\n\nAdditional ideas include:\n\n* Attaching a charge mechanic to mitigate abuse by burst champions or champions with low cooldown abilities, as well as create incentive to place oneself at risk in lane\n* An AD ratio for eventual application to AD casters\n\nA sample idea for the charge mechanic is to increase the rate at which a spell vamp proc charges via autoattacks.","replies":[{"poster":"Stacona","date":"2014-09-05T17:55:24.045+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't really want a charge or cooldown system for spell vamp, since I do want it to benefit more for sustain damage hyper mages more than burst mages.\nBUT the charge system could open up ideas for new items, that could be for an active or passive that acts like an active, but as far as spell vamp goes i prefer that it remains as a passive- i just feel that it should help out the hyper mages that have sustain damage in their kits somewhere the most and stay away from the burst types of mages since burst types should worry about one shotting their target and sustain mages should benefit from killing someone over X time which is where spell vamp i feel should be at and not about gaining a huge burst of heal from one-shotting someone and spell vamp should benefit sustain damage mages over the burst mages...\n\nthe attack damage ratio is their, despite there is no ad spell vamp options unless you count gunblade, is because spell vamp heals off of spell damage despite the source of the damage being physical, magical, or true--- but with spell vamp being a net health based on your AP/AD it can open up an AD spell vamp item since the restrictions of such item being formed now is the burst heal that a lot of AD casters would gain from it- with spell vamp being proc'd a certain amount from damage abilities instead of damage to health conversion can open new spell vamp items to the game","replies":[{"poster":"KSHarrison","date":"2014-09-05T19:31:07.739+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A charge or cooldown system caters to sustain damage mages because they fire off packets of burst every few seconds (think Ryze) as opposed to all in one rotation (like Brand).  Without a cooldown system, burst mages benefit from spell vamp equally as well as sustained mages, arguably better because it's immediate.  That's how spell vamp is currently set up.  \n\nWith my suggestion, the sustained mage will be constantly benefiting from the spell vamp, but the burst mage will have the spell vamp applied to only one of their abilities before they're spent.  This forcibly pushes burst mages away from Spell Vamp.  You can then do things like buff WOTA to 90 or 100 AP; in other words, Spell Vamp itemization becomes more dynamic.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninjaed","date":"2014-09-06T14:54:49.938+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually... Sustain is when you want to stay in lane. You refill (partly) your health bar to be able to fight and/or farm longer, possibly leading to an advantage. If you are bursted down, sustain is rendered useless. If not, you can steadily climb up back to \"safe levels\" of health, even during a fight.\n\nNow then, with this in mind... \n\n1) Infinite and easy lane sustain\n\nDoes it correct this issue? Nope. It actually makes it more glaring. Why build damage when you can build tankish and have that flat heal get you back on your feet every time? You won't need to fear being killed. Think Swain, Rumble, Darius or Garen. How fun would it be with this flat heal against them? Such an easy time for them...\n\n\n2) Too hard scaling, where assassins (especially snowballing) refill tons of life because they are burst oriented.\n\nBurst-oriented champions are also squishy. As I have written above, if bursted down, sustain is useless. When an assassin rushes in, they're at full health. When they're combo ends, same. Then, they're out of juice and have to wait before being of use again... And that's where sustain can become helpful to them.\n\nWith your changes, they will be denied another chance at a teamfight if they ever manage to survive after unleashing their first combo. They would have to go back to fountain and heal. Also... Those tanky champions with constant DPS (I have given 4 examples above)... they are hard to kill, with significant damage over time AND they would then recover insane amounts of health.\n\nIn other words, whereas assassins were the snowballing ones (according to you), the \"sustained\" ones would be the new snowballing ones. Moving a problem is not solving a problem...","replies":[{"poster":"Stacona","date":"2014-09-06T21:03:07.810+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Swain wouldn't get this spell vamp, he needs items to abuse his sustain, more sustain doesn't help him because he has over kill sustain already.

Damage lets you snowball a match and pressure other lanes.  In a teamfight, damage will be more useful than sustain.  You are weaker for building sustain, but it may provide a way for some champions to get through lane, whereupon you can compete on even footing later through your kit's natural scaling.\n\nEdit: I should also mention, I intended to make the lane interactive by reducing the cooldown on Spell Vamp procs through, for example, autoattacks.  This is meant to make sustaining through lane not a passive affair (as Spell Vamp is now) and open moments of weakness.  A champion who builds damage will be able to take advantage of this by securing incremental victories in lane through CS, kills, or superior trades.\n\n2) Did you play against assassins when sustain was viable?  Akali is a great example.  They are extremely difficult to deal with because poke becomes irrelevant, leaving you little counterplay against their superior all-in. The whole point of my changes is that assassins wouldn't build sustain but damage, just like they do now.  I don't see sustain as desirable on these types of champions.  They excel in deleting a single target, why should they be able to do that, heal up, and then go back in for round 2?  That would be broken.\n\nAs for tanky sustained DPS champions, I specifically stated that scaling on spell vamp should be kept low.  If you recover 50 hp every combo rotation, it's not going to be a big deal.  If you sacrificed on top of that 20 AP + DFG active by replacing your usual DFG with a WOTA, then you are actually scaling worse because your damage has decreased.\n\nThe whole point is to pigeonhole sustain as a way to get through lane, but not as a way to become unkillable later on.  The tradeoff is you deal less damage, making it only worthwhile on scaling champions in weak laning phases.  By limiting Spell Vamp's consistency and encouraging interaction in lane, sustain also doesn't become a free pass through the laning phase, as Vlad and Kennen's Hextech Revolver rush used to be.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Thryale","date":"2014-09-05T11:18:43.758+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"from the looks of it, the suggestions seem to be to make spell vamp the opposite of what it currently is.

Even Orianna's command attack could benefit from this, Anivia's Glacial Storm, Malzahar's malefic visions, pool, and ultimate, Karthus skittles and his E, Cassiopeia, machine gun Ryze, etc.\nBasically since marksmen can use sustain damage and lifesteal, hyper mages with sustain/constant damage should have a way to heal too to be on equal footing to marksmen late game scaling, especially hyper mages and hyper marksmen should scale equally.\n\nOverall though, Spell Vamp currently is focused mainly on the health mages of vlad and morde and is too strong on single target champions like akali.\nMy other thought process from an earlier date is lower the value of Spell Vamp to 8%(or 10%) and 12%(or 15%) respectively from 12% and 20% and remove the AoE restriction- similar to the change on spirit stone's sustain awhile back.","replies":[{"poster":"Sayath","date":"2014-09-05T21:03:25.477+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Damaging spells heal for x (+y / level) (+z%AP) health. Double this amount for non-damage-over-time single target spells.\n\nBy shifting the system towards spell application independent of damage dealt, you decrease the gap between single targeted and AoE spells. However, you open yourself up to a significant loop hole: **Damage spell count and cooldowns now dictate sustain**.\n\nA mage such as Orianna has significant cooldowns, even more so burst mages like Brand or Le'Blanc. Similiarly, Anivia's Flash frost has a CD of 12 to 8 seconds and Frostbite has a CD of 5 seconds. Consequently, spellvamp is completely ineffective on burst mages as you intended. However, I doubt that it's viable on mages like Orianna. After all, there exists far shorter cooldowns in this game: Karthus & Cassiopeia\n\nCassiopeia: Noxious Blast 3s, Miasma 9s, Twin Fang **0.5s** (5s without poison). \nKarthus: Lay Wast **1s**, Defile (how does your new system interact with such a spell?)\n\nSo instead of balancing spellvamp by its effectiveness on Vladimir and Akali, we balance it w.r.t. Cassio and Karthus instead. Furthermore, Akali for example, intended to function as a hypercarry, is completely balanced around having such huge sustain. Hence, even more balance work will be required. So I don't really see the benefit of your solution. It just creates a different set of problems, a different class of spellvamp users.\n\nBeyond, I'm confused by your terminology.  A \"hyper mage\" is something that currently doesn't exist in Riot's vocabulary.  You want (some) sustained damage mages to be on par with hypercarries like Kog'Maw and Tristana? However, given that these mages are significant sources of CC by themselves, e.g., Anivia provides a huge slow field, Malzahar a suppression, Cassiopeia an AoE stun, etc., this seems unwise. Only mages that have very significant / low amounts of CC or give up large chunks of power in other areas can be considered for a hypercarry position.\n\nFor example, Akali is allowed to be a hypercarry and have substantial sustain because she directly risks her life in melee combat, having no hard CC by herself at all and only dealing single-target damage. Similarly, Karthus creates a zone of high pressure AoE damage by essentially suiciding. He's a low mobility mage with no CC besides a strong slow. In contrast, Orianna is a high pressure (lane bully), safe farming mage with a teamfight deciding AoE CC ultimate. The latter clearly doesn't need buffs when she's already constantly being played in LCS.\n\nHaving said that, let's once again discuss the fundamentals of Spellvamp:\n\n**What do you see as the current issues with the spellvamp system?**\nPrimarily, I estimate you want mages to also utilize spellvamp, not just ressourcless / energy-based characters. You want spellvamp to be a more general stat to mages, similar as lifesteal is to marksman.\nHowever, the question arises whether that is actually a valid goal. Should mages really have access to sustain? You yourself even said that burst mages in general should not. So we have to immediately restrict the set of viable champions to **sustained damage mages.**\nOn that specific champion pool, should the statistic be strong early or late game? Clearly, times and times again sustain has been determined to be a negative when introduced to the early game in too high of a quantity since it reverses player interaction (damage taken) and turns the lane play stale. Hence, spellvamp should be **strong late game**. This should create an opportunity for sustained damage mages to provide their output longer to a fight, similar to a marksman.\n\nI hope I've correctly identified your position so far.\n\nNext, **what should we do about the above, while minimizing fallout?** That's a really hard question which we shouldn't answer presumptuously. I believe we should first identify the core problems more throughly: Locate the set of champions that are currently utilizing spellvamp, the set of champions we want to support and the impact we expect it to have. Only then we are able to make an informed decision.","replies":[{"poster":"Stacona","date":"2014-09-06T20:41:05.034+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Anivia doesn't only have burst, she has sustain damage from Glacial Storm\n\nA Hyper Mage are typically those that are weak early and strong late\n\nAnivia, Ryze, Karthus, etc. are hyper mages - Riot is trying to make Cassiopeia a hyper mage as well, Azir is suppose to be a hyper mage\n\nI did make the spell vamp scale on champion level and bonus AD and AP in order for champions to get properly punished early and have the sustain for late game.\n\nThe curent spell vamp users and Vlad, Morde, and Akali - I am fine with these champions using the stat, but Akali is an over the top abuser and I do hope this change tones down the effectiveness on her, but it will still be strong- morde and vlad should be equal with this spell vamp and the current version.\nBesides those that we know will use spell vamp, i hope that this idea will have more champions buying spell vamp and possibly open up new itemization so that there can be AD spell vamp options for AD casters can get the stat too.

Numbers are always up for adjustments, mechanics aren't.\n\nPersonally, my advise is that if you are trying to design a system, ask more hard questions. Define your goals more clearly.

The dominant picks are Tristana and Kog'maw because they bring the most impact to the team.\n\nYes, champions are sometimes undervalued and remain hidden from the spot light until (re-)discovered. However, when we purely focus on damage, Ashe is very underwhelming. To be honest, when Riot talks about hypercarries, they only consider damage, for good reason.\n\nA hypercarry is supposed to dish out huge amounts of damage, given the team can protect him. Furthermore, a hypercarry excellently scales with items. For example, hypercarries in DotA could 1v5 teams. In LoL, Kog and Tristana are the closest to fit that description. Ashe just doesn't. Her utility is constant. She does scale with itemization in comparison to Kog very weakly. However, that's fine. She fills a different niche, bringing utility to the carry slot. Still, she is no hypercarry and isn't supposed to be.\n\nIn conclusion, I'm completely disagreeing with you based on the Riot definition. Your definition is not the one Riot or the community at large uses. Of course, you can redefine these terms. However, you need to actually **state that you did**. Otherwise, people expect you to adhere to the original meaning and will heavily disagree with you because you and them are talking about **completely different things**.\n\nSo, what is a hypercarry to you?
