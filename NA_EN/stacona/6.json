Cull as it stands right now is a terrible starting item since DBlade's stats are way much more useful at the start and if you backed at an actual good time then there's no reason whatsoever to pick Cull since you can just get an actual item... not to mention that if you are actually behind buying cull will only set you even further back since the stats it provides are laughable (5 AD) and do nothing for you when behind for such a pitiful reward while DBlade gives you plenty of stats that are actually useful for you in combat.

So you get 150 G if you cs perfectly at 11 minutes and if you forsake the extra stats of the a Doran&#039;s Blade. 150 G. That&#039;s practically nothing, but that&#039;s your **potential **gain.\n\nThe potential gain you get from a doran's blades is 450 - 180 = -270. Meaning you take a gold loss. Also learn math 580 - 450 = 130. meaning using only what's listed only the item's, you are up 400g from your opponent by taking cull and finishing it.\n\n> On the other hand, if you opt to start a Doran&#039;s blade instead, you get 80 HP and +3 AD and 3% lifesteal that greatly compliments the new mastery changes and can scale. These small stats that you gain by choosing Doran&#039;s Blade instead of Cull are vastly, immensely, and exponentially more valuable than the measly 150 G. \n\nCull gives 5 AD and 3 life on hit. Now early game 3 life on hit is more effective than 3% lifesteal as you need 100 AD to break even (if they have 0 armor) for lifesteal compared to life on hit. In addition cull gives you money to set you up for the late game. Now in the bot lane it's more efficient to take doran's blade as you remain in lane longer (and thus have more gold and time to reach that 100 AD). However cull is aimed more at top and mid laner's who tend to have more farming efficiency  and tend to back earlier to buy. The HP of doran's in nice, but with the fact that cull has superior early sustain, on top of the sustain that top laners normally have this makes it a better item for most ad top laners and a decent item for certain AD mid matchups.\n\n> Most people hang on to their Doran&#039;s for a long time. That&#039;s how valuable and gold efficient it is. The lane phase power that Doran&#039;s Blade offers is too much to ignore. Why would anyone want a potential +150 G when they might lose just as much or even more gold because they were denied CS in lane as a result of Cull being weaker than Doran&#039;s Blade?\n\nAnother big reason most people hold on to Doran's Blade for a long time because if they sell it, they are taking a loss in money value of items. So even though they may be up by 300 gold on the other laner in terms of gold they've made, if they sell doran's blade to buy something they're just putting their actual item value at the same level as their opponents. Also they hold onto it because they tend to have room for it in their inventories and it doesn't make sense to get rid of it when it doesn't cost them anything to do so. (Same reason people hold on to cull after it's passive has finished, except you don't feel bad for selling it, unlike doran's blade)\n \n> If cull could upgrade, however, then it might actually be worth while. It makes sense for it to upgrade into Vampiric Sceptre both stat wise and visually even. So, why doesn&#039;t it?\n\nRiot's done plenty of posts of this (you can check old forums for them), the reason starting items don't build into anything is because they are extremely stat efficient at the cost of losing gold when you sell them later. Cull merely provides it's stat efficiency in the form of giving you gold.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LatetotheRace","date":"2015-11-20T03:48:44.077+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not sure what real \"risk\" it has.

Typically though, those items saw play because if you can stay alive and farm competitively with your opponent you simply come out ahead in terms of gold. More gold early = bigger items faster. Bankplank, Avarice Ashe, etc. They all saw moments of popularity or power because they let you outscale your opponents.\n\nCull seems to be their attempt at finding a middleground. Because the gold has a hard limit, its less game-tilting than the previous iterations. I see it being most popular with top-lane farmers; Nasus, GP, top tanks. Anyone who isn't interested in killing or pushing the lane but instead just wants to bunker down and farm their way past 6. Bot lane it still has a place. I've used it a few times, but I've had it backfire. Some lanes my support ended up playing more aggressively than I anticipated, and between our junglers ganking and support starting fights I didn't really get a good chance to farm out the gold. However I could see it being a good pick if you have a sustain support like Soraka, who you know isn't going to be rushing face first into fights.\n\nShould it always be your first item? No. If you're against a kill lane or an aggressive support pick, the meager stats it provides leaves you more vulnerable. But I would hardly call it a \"noob trap\", considering how powerful gold itself is. And especially with the higher amount of gold in general - more starting gold, etc - I noticed that I'm getting my first big purchases significantly sooner. Which makes those Champs with an early power spike even more threatening.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Rewritten","date":"2015-11-20T08:01:20.945+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cull is REALLY good on Graves.  \n\nHe heals for 3 PER bullet.
