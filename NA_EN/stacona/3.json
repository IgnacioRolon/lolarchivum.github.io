This can be replicated 100% of the time. Just not sure how long the distance needs to be to displace the sand soldier to disable the basic attack damage.\r\n\r\n~ Stacona","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Afic","date":"2014-09-24T16:28:46.405+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for this post!
