We can start by showing kindness to others and encourage creative works, even if it is not perfect or very good, we can give nice feedback that actually helps them improve in a good fashion and then suddenly we will a super awesome community that people want to be around and every benefits with having super good and cool creative work in this specific forum.

Now before you call me a \"downvoting troll\", if you check my post history I make a strong effort to give full feedback on ideas I take interest in, even those I think don't work that great.\n\nWhile downvoting does enable trolls to an extent, some ideas are just plain bad or inflammatory. In this situation, a downvote is needed because you should not support that idea. Now, this makes the issue of downvoting without feedback, so here's another scenario.\nLet's say rather than remove downvotes altogether, you had to make a comment on the thread before you downvoted it. It removes anonymity and potentially provides feedback. But here's other issue: What if the user can't take feedback? What if, despite multiple people telling them their idea doesn't seem good, the poster responds with harassment? It can result in arguments that wouldn't have happened if the user had just been allowed to downvote anonymously.\n\nBut let's say you **do** know who is downvoting your work. What can you do? You can't force someone to change that opinion. Whether they gave it because they genuinely don't agree or they gave it because they're trolling, that's their prerogative. There are just people like that in the world. That said, not every idea is great. Not every concept submitted by a person is good.\n\nAnyway that's just me. I always think there should be a spot reserved for criticism, whether it be known or unknown. A character design teacher of 20 years summed it up perfectly once: \"If you disallow criticism then your idea swims in mediocrity\". If there are no 'bad' ideas, then you can't weed them out from the 'good' ones.\n\nNow: everything said and done, I can unfortunately tell you this now that downvotes won't be removed. It is the nature of the forums that Riot have built, and even allow themselves to be downvoted. Just learn to move passed it.","replies":[{"poster":"Stacona","date":"2016-03-20T19:34:01.023+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"If you are nice about it people are accepting of feedback and if you are not being nice then people take it as bashing on them. You will provide feedback to help them improve, but downvoting does not do that it is lazy and for trolls, it tells the poster absolutely nothing and once you downvote it puts someone is bad mood and then they do not accept any feedback.\n\nIt doesn't make if things are great or good, but we do not want to discourage the creative process just because someone does not know how to polish their ideas does not mean their ideas are bad and they can have good points and just need improvements. We don't want to discourage creativity because that would mean we get less and less fresh and new ideas.

There have been issues in the past of people being unable to have their ideas critiqued.\n\n>You will provide feedback to help them improve, but downvoting does not do that it is lazy and for trolls, it tells the poster absolutely nothing and once you downvote it puts someone is bad mood and then they do not accept any feedback.\n\nIt's not for trolls. If I see a thread that says \"Make Ballet Sion\" and the only line in the thread is \"It would be so funny! I would pay so much money!\", I can downvote that. If the user hasn't bothered to put in the effort to describe their idea or why it should be a part of the game, why should I have to put in the effort to make a comment? And I've been downvoted plenty of times before. It doesn't put me in a bad mood in the slightest. If you let it affect your mood that's when it becomes an issue. You've bought up a few times the fact that someone has been following you around downvoting your stuff. Did you ever stop to think that maybe it's because you're making so many comments about how your stuff is being downvoted? Sure, it's clearly someone trying to poke you, but at the same time what do you honestly expect to happen? It's like people who touch stuff that has a 'Caution: Wet Paint' sign. If you ask people not to, there's always going to be people who will.\n\n> It doesn't make if things are great or good, but we do not want to discourage the creative process just because someone does not know how to polish their ideas does not mean their ideas are bad and they can have good points and just need improvements. We don't want to discourage creativity because that would mean we get less and less fresh and new ideas.\n\nIt's not about discouraging creativity. A downvote represents a disagreement or a dislike of the people that are on the forums at the time. You could submit an idea at 9AM and the same idea at 9PM and they would get different results. Heck, within the last day [someone has proven just that\n](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/PVNBqfox-update-the-inhibitors-icon). That was his **third time** submitting the same thread. The first time got 3 upvotes and the second time got a -1. But he stuck with his idea. He saw that he posted it during a time where he maybe wouldn't have gotten a lot of exposure, and tried again. Now, I am not encouraging people to spam the forums with their ideas. I'm just saying that there are more factors than you may think there are.\n\n>So what downvoting does is make everyone eventually think the same because if they think differently they just shit by trolls downvoting and people change their opinions if they see negativity rather than positivity so no one will ever give a downvoted post a fair shake.\n\nThat's not true in the slightest. I come on the board multiple times a day (I'm a character design student so this is a good source for bouncing around idea's with people and giving feedback) and I see plenty of new and interesting ideas. But at the same time, yes there is a lot of generic ideas, but that's not due to downvoters. From what I've seen it's most likely due to people not being too creative or being able to see how Riot decide what direction they're going in. And that's not a personal jab or anything. I've honestly never read one of your ideas so I'm completely unbiased. But honestly, and I see this in my course too, not everyone is cut out for it. Some people just don't have that natural spark that others do.\n\nAs I said with my first comment this is just personal opinion and I guess I can approach this a little differently given my background.","replies":[{"poster":"Vorazun","date":"2016-03-21T02:00:13.415+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"I know this is a bit off topic, perhaps even ironic given the context, but could you look at [my idea?](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/QP8PO7Wd-champion-concept-aeria-the-iron-ranger)","replies":[{"poster":"Lonely Flame","date":"2016-03-21T14:29:59.800+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey dude, I'm actually heading into my exam/assessment week and so I'll be a little pressed for time.

I myself am an artist who strives to work in the game industry soon. I used to use these boards as a way to practice my craft before I worked to make a professional portfolio. My work consisted of a couple of custom champs that featured some doodles or artwork I did on my spare time.

This was mostly done in the format of anonymous downvotes without any rhyme or reason. In their eyes, it's easy to drop in and dislike something for the sake of disliking it - because it removes all responsibility.\n\nMaybe, the answer to this dilemma is to make any dislike on a thread prompt a comment to justify a negative vote.

Downvotes MIGHT be different if it was not exploited, even then I still don't think it would be good for a forum because downvotes take away from the discussion aspect of a forum since over 98% of people that downvote do not leave a comment; at least in a debate is typically better than shitting on someone and walking away because you can at least make your case for something if 2 parties disagree.","replies":[{"poster":"Mama Soraka","date":"2016-03-21T08:48:43.389+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know this isn't the best place to ask but it seems like your concept thread about that Yordle gunner you were working has disappeared entirely, and just after I gave you some very lengthy and heartfelt feedback about the idea.

Some things I've noticed currently are\n\n-Digital art gets way more attention than traditional art\n-A lot of the troll stuff (3 second done ms paint drawings, weird skin ideas, etc) get a lot more attention than drawings that took the person so long to do and have so much effort put into them\n\nAs a traditional artist, it feels pretty crappy seeing all this beautiful digital art get lots of attention. I mean, they deserve it, it's really good..but like...nobody cares much for traditional art.\n\nI just finished a big drawing I did for Aurelion Sol. Drew it, Sharpie'd it, colored the whole thing. I'm pretty proud of it (I usually don't color, I like to do all my stuff in pencil because I feel you can include more detail with a regular pencil than colored pencils, so this was a pretty big deal for me lol). My goal is to get it into Aurelion's community creations, because it would be my first time getting into one and it'd be for a champ I've waited so long for. I was so hyped about it I was like \"yea I'm gonna do this\".  I posted it here and on my tumblr and.....nobody cares. It's a pretty shitty feeling when you work so hard on something and then nobody seems to care about it.\n\nI just realized that I literally have no chance at getting in. My art isn't getting enough attention for Riot to include it, not with all these gorgeous digital pieces of art getting hundreds and hundreds of notes and likes and comments. \n\nI don't know how it would be done and I don't think it can be done....my comment has no point.
