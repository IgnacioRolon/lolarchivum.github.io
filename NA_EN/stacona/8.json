This item will not consume an item slot since it can combine with any fully completed item that does not have an active to it already (you click and drag the item into an item like you are moving it to another slot to combine it with that full tier item; to move the Flash item to another slot without combining it that an item on its final tier already is in you move that final tier item instead of moving the Flash item).\r\n\r\nThe Flash item can be combined with doran items and tier 2 boots with or without an enchantment.\r\n\r\nThis idea is to keep Flash in the game while bringing Summoner Spell diversity, otherwise Flash should be removed from the game because it is the overally dominant option.\r\n\r\n~ Stacona","replies":[{"poster":"junglerboy16","date":"2014-10-08T00:05:15.052+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's definitely a different way of approaching the problem with summoner diversity, seeing as right now huge cool down and short range don't seem to make it less of a valued pick as much as an over valued pick that requires whole entire strategies based around timing enemy flashes etc. I think I have to agree that it seems pointless to have it take a summoner spot when almost 99% of players who have access to it (as in, above lvl 12) use it almost every game. I do think, though, that it would also necessitate a complete rebalance of almost all the other summoners to do this since if flash were removed/moved to an item, because then it would just be take ghost/ignite/TP/exhaust/heal (not counting smite since that is a given for any sane jungler), and still leave other summoners out in the cold (Barrier/clairvoyance/clarity/cleanse/REVIVE/etc.). Before they even bother taking flash down a notch, they should deal with balancing the other spells to at least be equal to each other through different strategies and windows of strength, because, tbh, flash will always be the best summoner unless they give it some crazy handicap like a 9 minute cool down like revive, so they ought not to focus balance of summoners around flash, but around each other primarily.","replies":[{"poster":"Stacona","date":"2014-10-08T00:20:42.451+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The thing is, you can only know the other dominant summoner spells through playtesting on LIVE servers (PBE wouldn't  give a proper tell) maybe clarity would be the second summoner spell for mid laners (that use mana) CV for supports, marksmen may be heal barrier or heal cleanse or barrier cleanse or possibly use heal exhaust etc there are a lot more option there - supports can use cv ignite exhaust heal etc - top laners can use teleport ghost exhaust cv clarity, revive -- revive could be used on the carry role of marksmen or mage -- or revive on tanks for double tanks for the same tank\n\nanyways, to balance the spell the Flash as a free item that can combine with another item should happen first, i would like to see it for the pre-season 5-- and then the other summoner spells can be balanced after seeing people play with the Flash change of being a summoner spell to an item - again thing that affect flash now will still affect flash the same way, just tooltip rewording removing the summoner spell to item etc","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"InsaneSamurai","date":"2014-10-08T00:05:58.483+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think they should only allow champions who don't have their own flash-like skill to take flash.
