Make Zed more unique and grant him some kind of utility for his team to play around, so that he can be useful when behind meaning he does not need a feast or famine gameplay pattern. Also the obvious of try to make Zed (and every single assassin) different from each other rather than reskins of each other, but they all do the same thing.\n\n2. Make playing against Zed a lot less frustrating. This means a lot better counter play, one shots should be removed from the game straight up, and removing elements from Zed just to focus on an unique identity and making that shine through a lot harder.\n\n3. Assassins as pure killers is not good for League of Legends, they should be more like neutralizers this way you make them always useful without feast or famine and offer better counter play. The entire assassin class needs to be reworked and redefined for league of legends because their current job is not healthy for the game nor can you ever make it healthy. Besides you do not need non-counter playable levels of burst to kill your target anyways, there are a lot better ways to make assassins.\n\n****\n\n> **Attack Range:** 125 units\n> **Movement:** 350 units per second\n> **Energy Pool:** 100 (halved to normal)\n> **Energy Regen:** 20% energy per 5 seconds (normal is 50 energy per 5 seconds)\n> \n> ****\n> \n> _**Endurance Training (Passive):**_\n> \n> Zed increases his maximum energy pool by (+25%mana), based on bonus mana that he acquires.
