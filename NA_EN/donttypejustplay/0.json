The runes were re-arranged in less optimal tiers, so that the best combinations were not possible. Actually, inspiration has probably been nerfed more than any other tree. Originally, TWT was a trait of taking Inspiration in the first place! Biscuits have been changed a couple times.  OP kind of has a point - the tree is advanced, and much stronger in high MMR. In low MMR, partly because players aren't as efficient with gold, and partly because the game goes on longer, Inspiration becomes worse, indeed to the point of trolling at times. Unsealed Spellbook is particularly sophisticated.\n\nIn low MMR, unless Inspiration is an obvious choice for some reason, probably better to go with something simpler, or scaling. If you're good enough to use Inspiration properly in low MMR, then you're probably good enough to get gold that others are missing, and instead take scaling runes.\n\nWhich is basically what OP was saying.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"DuskDaUmbreon","date":"2019-09-07T01:12:39.906+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"No wonder you lost that game as Nasus if you think inspiration is bad.\n\nSpellbook is immense versatility.

In general, Sorcery is a \"statty\" tree. (Or \"stat-checky\")\n\nT4 - again, these are strong ... when you compare HOW much you are getting from Sorcery in T3 or T4...\n\nT3 in Domination needs to be stacked in ways that are by no means certain, for a maximum of 18AD. T3 and T4 in Sorcery contains Runes worth a lot more than that, and they don't require stacking, or else they stack by themselves. Depending on the champion, Transcendence can be played for over 100 AD. Even a single stack will give 12 AD. And by 20m, the value of Gathering Storm has surpassed all of those T3 Domination Runes. Just for staying in the game. Not even a single takedown.\n\nNot knocking the Domination Runes. Some are quite strong. Sorcery has some runes that can be pushed farther..","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"True Garen","date":"2019-09-07T07:18:55.776+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Again... OP comes down on Stopwatch. Well... if you KNOW that you'll be building a GA anyway, then stopwatch makes a lot of sense. That would make it a very valuable rune. Matches were you are playing a carry or hypercarry, matches where you are vs a champion with Ult/Execute reset mechanics. But in low MMR, again, the GA is not as good an item, your teammates won't ensure your revival etc... so Stopwatch value becomes elusive...\n\nMages who almost always build Zhonyas, on the other hand, really do want the stopwatch. But, if rune in another tree will make you strong enough to get a couple early kills... experience would teach to avoid Inspiration. In high MMR, and pro play especially, where early kills are infrequent, then the Stopwatch becomes more attractive.\n\nThis is the same argument regarding Cleanse summ. I know that I'll need either Cleanse or a QSS in a particular match. (And my champion uses Mercurial decently.) I could take Cleanse and save the gold. Or I could take Ignite or Exhaust and get a couple early kill that would pay for the QSS (which has a shorter CD besides).","replies":[]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-09-07T03:09:42.682+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can't remember the last time I saw an Inspiration keystone other than Klepto (on Ez of course) in a high-level match.
