Some champs have waited over four years for new skins (Yorick, Kassadin, Sion and Taric), yet Ekko gets one announced two months after release?  Seems suspect at the very least, especially considering that this tier is regarded as the lowest in quality.\n2.  The other champs in the \"Academy\" line aren't starved for skin love, are they?  Darius and Vladimir already have legendary level skins and their last ones were released less than a year ago.  Ahri's going to be on her 7th skin (including Classic) and she already had a skin released this year!\n3.  With these skins, it seems that Riot's only interested in creating skins for popular champions (thus justifying their salaries as players make RP purchases) more than delivering high quality skins for champions that haven't been touched in years.  (Blood Moon Zilean, King of Clubs Mordekaiser and Safecracker Eve being the worst examples of this.)  I'm sure this isn't true, but in a year when a champion sees their 10th skin (Annie) released without apology, it doesn't feel false.\n\nI'm all for allowing every department within Riot the freedom to release content as they want to, but I would hope that the focus is more towards correcting and filling their backlog of unloved champs.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Krys Star","date":"2015-08-05T19:11:50.637+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can't help but feel like this was an excuse made off the bat.

I think that if riot could produce these many skins for any champions then i dont see a problem. Much like Mr/Miss GALETTA said they have many skins ongoing, i think that if you rush a skin and release it, because of the gamers are complaining, we wont get anywhere since 1) it would be shitty and/or 2) the theme would not fit.\nWith that saying, i feel like some champions would need a VU or some sort of skin Texture change before they would receive a skin.\nPersonally {{champion:131}} classic and Dark Valkyrie {{champion:131}}  needs a texture polish or just an overall Update (game and visual), her texturing and coloring like a smashed palette that has been mixed. Maybe we should not complain about New Skins for X champ and look at which champs need some remodeling or texture refining. Just a thought.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Murphys Lawyer","date":"2015-08-05T20:48:25.159+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It also sends a bad message to do this: \"Hey, community, here's proof that we can do a skin within 2 months time, but here's a list of the same bad excuses for why those of you waiting for several years still have to wait indefinitely for skins we may or may not even be making.\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"Baby Ghoul","date":"2015-08-05T20:12:01.623+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ekko and Ahri are fan favorites right now, so I'm not at all surprised that they're getting skins so recently after the release of their last one. The Ekko skin release makes less sense because he was just released this summer. At least Ahri's was a legacy skin released back in January.\n\nI'm a little disappointed by all of this. A lot of us have to wait **years** to get a skin. Irelia had to wait a long time before they gave her a 750 RP skin recently. I'm sure this is great for the majority of people who main those champions that do get frequent skin releases, but just know that the rest of us don't appreciate it that much Riot.","replies":[]},{"poster":" Chuńky","date":"2016-05-23T04:20:51.086+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"We really need some Ekko skins...
