When I came from my work, my lil' bro was using the pc... And he said that he accidentally deleted something... He deleted everything inside the Riot games folder excep the internal League of Legends folder... (On the other word, the launcher and other stuffs) I can't Launch the game anymore... Then I tried to install just the launcher... But when I run the installation file... It said Remove League of Legends... Actually i dun wanna remove the whole thing itself, cuz I have really slow internet...(around 100-200kb) I would need to download for whole day if i remove...
