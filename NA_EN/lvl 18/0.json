This leads to {{summoner:21}}  only being useful early game, but still lacks because of mobility the main stream right now.\n\nBarrier right now blocks 115 flat and 16.66 per level (115-450) for the next 2 seconds. {{summoner:7}}  right now gives you a flat 95 health and 21.11 per level(95-475) and also gives you 30% move speed for the next second.\n\nThere are two different option for {{summoner:21}} buff that I have in mind.\n\nOption 1 -\n It should block a flat 125 and give 25+/- per level (125-575). Since it does lack mobility it still won't be picked more, but is better for the more safe champions that already have a bunch of mobility. This would be more fit for midlaners since their trades are so small and burst is so high. More made for small engages and needs to block more.\n\nOption 2 -\nIt should block the same about it does right now (115-450) but give you 35% move speed for the next 3 seconds. Since it is not giving you flat health back I believe you should get more mobility since you only have 2 seconds to block everything.","replies":[{"poster":"ricklessabandon","date":"2014-07-21T10:06:19.020+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":2,"body":"not sure if this is relevant or not, but heal is potentially getting nerfed in the 4.13 patch (the changes should be in the next pbe update).\n\ni also have a change to exhaust, but that's it for summoner spells in 4.13 (and again, they're **candidates**—like anything else on the pbe, they will be subject to change/removal).","replies":[{"poster":"Akava","date":"2014-07-21T14:54:53.679+0000","up_votes":23,"down_votes":6,"body":"I think it'd be better to buff {{summoner:21}} in a way that makes it fill a different space.

This was most likely caused by no checks and balances on what a champ can and cannot have which we have today. unfortunately they can just remove flash as it is used as the balance point over more than 20 champions. all of those champion would have to either have a complete remake of their identity including concept in order for them to do so.

It actually gives the player (and an ally) x amount of hp back. It makes them move faster. Barrier only TEMPORARILY shields someone. So, in a drawn out duel, heal almost always wins due to the fact that the hp is given back, whereas barrier can be waited out.\n\nBy giving heal and barrier their own benefits, you must clearly define what traits make each spell. \n\nHeal: \n• Gives HP back\n• Heals ally\n• Makes people move faster\n• Sound like a defensive pick\n\nHeal currently has a lot of utility for not only yourself, but an ally. Honestly, heal has been nerfed pretty hard over the past patches, and I think it's in a good spot. Barrier just needs to be buffed. Since barrier is only single target, it needs to at least have a stronger shield.\n\nBarrier: \n• Shield lasts 2 seconds. (Can be easily waited out.)\n• Pretty weak shield when compared to heal, which GIVES BACK hp.\n• No movement speed.\n• Single target.\n\nProposed changes:\n• When barrier is used, cleanse all cc off of the user. (Why? Because if a person, ex: adc, is cc'd, he/she is probably gonna die. Barrier is supposed to help them survive the burst and whatnot. Allowing it to absorb some of the damage and give the person a chance to stay alive/ kite/ fight.)\n• Stronger shield.\n• 3 second duration. (Giving hp BACK is almost always going to be better than just having a temporary shield that can be waited out, but this can allow more plays to happen.).\n\ntl;dr: Define which traits make each summoner spells and go from there.

Cleanse is outclassed by other spells that do more at a time, and I think should actually be combined with Barrier (see above) as a clutch immunity spell. Clarity, though, is not a good spell. It's a crutch that only appeals to players who are inexperienced with mana management, and gets quickly dropped once they familiarize themselves with mana champions in general.

Whichever one soaks up more damage than the other on stats alone is going to win, and currently Barrier is outclassed in almost every respect by Heal.
