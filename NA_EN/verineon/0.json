I am not a toxic player, never have been toxic and never have gotten any penalty for it. I'm relatively new to the game since I started back in June, but I'm wondering how I can get to honor lvl 3. A lot of my other friends have reached it, some of them Honor lvls 4 and 5. They constantly make fun of me for still being honor lvl 2. And to be honest I don't even know what I do differently. They just do the same stuff as me, yet they are growing in honor and i'm still stuck. If anyone could give any helpful advice for me that would be great thanks! :D","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-05T22:44:17.183+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, that's no good if they're making fun of you for not being a higher honor rank yet. Most of it depends on how many games you're playing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Utahraptor","date":"2017-09-04T01:12:29.436+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have a little advice, and that is that junglers can easily get the most honor. Jungle as many know is a dangerous lane because you can get salted so easily! But a good jungler that can engage and help win teamfights and give the laners kills are often times most honored in my games. Also, no one likes someone who steals a lot of kills (unless you are adc) so often times carrying the game will get you a lot of kills, but taking kills to try and carry the game will not get you honor. When the other laners fail and you happen to be owning your lane, you will most likely carry that game, and get honored for doing so well in your game. Note: this is is my experiences, and I only honor jg and supp, because I feel like they never get recognized.","replies":[]}]}
