She's not Blood Moon if she's not red, end of story. If you want a pink Elise skin, make it Popstar. That's like saying you're making a \"Fullmetal Kassadin\" skin, but he's not actually made of metal. Why even call the skin that way then?\n\nI really honestly don't care how many people want it pink, it should be your duty to stick to the theme given to each skin series, and not change one pink just because a couple people think it looks better. The only reason they think it looks better is because pink was first. It's human psyche. It's the \"Lee Sin\" effect, where the only reason people wanted Lee Sin was because he appeared in a very early trailer of League of Legends.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ScarletKitty00","date":"2015-01-10T19:07:36.344+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":6,"body":"The pink contrasted far better with her.

Although I'm personally the fan of the **original setting (not only because I like pink better, but also the other settings of the skin work well with pink)**, I find it meaningless to just post the repetitive opinions again. Therefore, I want to choose to compromise and offer some of my humble ideas:\n\n**KOI NAMI's Red**\nIf Riot has to change the pink to red, can you use the red as Koi Nami's body? That would look great since I personally find the current color is just to bright and it's \"red red\" and looks really boring. KOI NAMI has the red that's red and dark enough to fit the blood moon theme while still being elegant for a champion like Elise.\n\n**\"THRESH's Gold\"**\nSince the original skin was designed to be pink, the purple/blue color and yellow-gold legs really go with the package. However, since you changed it to red, can you also make her gold legs more like the gold that you used in Thresh's blood moon skin? That one looks more \"Champagne Gold\" instead of \"gold gold\" and works very well with Thresh. Or you can simply use the goldish color on BM Elise's spider body (the mask). I don't think it's a good idea to change it into other colors tho. I know gold is also part of the blood moon theme :). Also, the little spiders also need some changes since their queen is different now.The models are different and I'm sure there is a way to make them look different than her classic skin spiders. Moreover, I don't mind the blue because her hair is blue and her skill animation has blue in it.\n\nI really really really like her Blood Moon Skin and don't think it is a good idea to change her skin name since BM is sooo cool she deserves that instead of lotus order or heart seeker. I really hope riot can see this and take my ideas into consideration. I really think this would look really good and it could be a solution that meets both side's tastes.\n\nSincerely\n\nHappy Holidays!

It sorta opens the way for players to truly have custom skins to show off the champion they love. From Riots point of view i could see this as a great money making opportunity as well.\nThink about it.\nno matter what you decide, half (aprox.) will choose not to buy the skin because the didnt like pink/red, on the other hand if you make it available in 2 different colors you no longer divide your customer base.\nyou also lose nothing in return, the skin is made, and a color change takes little to no effect and a few hours if that.\n\nPersonally im not a elise player, i probably wont buy the skin unless i start playing elise, but the reason i want to advocate this so much is because i think riot should be more open to situations like these, offering themed skins in a variety of colors, or what not. \nalso color changes are some of my favorite skins, like xerath, i love all the different colors he can be, as well as velkoz(having red lazers is bad ass)\nTL;DR: Make BM Elise available in both colors, you make money, elise players are happy:D","replies":[]},{"poster":"Poptart Evelynn","date":"2014-11-30T01:31:43.648+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"> The color change was based off of the feedback that we had received from players when she hit the PBE.

That said the fleshy pink cleavage still feels like it is the focus of attention instead of the blood moon elements of the skin.  If you could cover the cleavage 'kimono' style with again more of the blood moon red I think it would really tie the skin together.  I'm sure that Riot's artists can still make the cleavage appeal as cleavage while being covered with blood moon textured cloth.
