However, I see two newer games in my match history that confirm (for me) that my account was definitely hacked, and whoever it was was definitely scripting judging by the stats for reach game.\n\nThis honestly pisses me off, because I'm essentially being preyed on by some phisher or hacker with nothing better to do.\n\nThis is just more of a \"has it happened to you\" post. I'm already trying to contact Riot, but I already have a sinking feeling that they won't even bother with me at this point. \n\nI had a good run I guess, thank you for the fun Riot.

There's no way you can possibly justify that. In any case, per riot customer support, there was a massive bot wave recently and they are investigating. Riot can tell what IP the account is logged in from, which is more than enough evidence to clear me of wrongdoing.","replies":[{"poster":"Sukishoo","date":"2019-03-15T00:27:09.110+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":5,"body":">I shouldn't be held responsible for the actions of a bot.\n\nWhat bot?

I keep my machine fairly tight. I don't touch suspicious links, I have up to date anti-virus, my router is protected, my password has a very diverse cast (lol). It seems to me like at some point a player can only do so much to protect themselves. This is where the company steps in to verify if the account holder was the one actually exploiting (which is currently underway.)","replies":[{"poster":"Sukishoo","date":"2019-03-15T02:04:29.816+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":">This is where the company steps in to verify if the account holder was the one actually exploiting (which is currently underway.)\n\nYes, but from what has been seen around the forums  over the years from various incidents like this Riot doesn't really take much difference in if it was the Owner of the account vs Someone else. They will hold both sides responsible.\n\nI even remember a recent one about a ban similar to this where they showed the ticket that even said \"Nothing suspicious was found on the account\" but they would not reverse the ban.","replies":[{"poster":"CV Protostar","date":"2019-03-15T02:44:07.553+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I suppose we will see how it goes then.

The company does have some responsibility towards the consumers to keep our stuff safe (to a certain extent.) But to clearly say it was your fault it is absurd. Especially since riot does not offer any extra security besides 1 password. Unlike games like FF14 that you can have 2 codes one that keeps resetting. \n\nIf that were the case and someone did not use that option then sure. But for a game you can spend a lot of money on I'd like some extra security there is a lot of ways to steal peoples info now a days.","replies":[{"poster":"Sukishoo","date":"2019-03-15T01:00:11.782+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">You expect someone to keep a watch on all accounts on all games all the time?\n\nYou act like that's hard.

No, I said an extra layer of security be nice. And what kind of dumb logic is it that \"oh if your not playing it right now then you shouldn't care what happens to it.\" that is ridiculous. Many games just add on a one time password. Then it resets by an phone app or something like that. I never had any problems with my game accounts. But had my crunchy roll and origin accessed by some china crap. But they couldn't do anything harmful with those before i got them changed. However if they can get on your account then bot for w.e reason then you get perma banned yeah thats a problem. \n\nI mean if that shit happen to you, you wouldn't be all up here in the forums with your \"It's my fault attitude\" of yours.
