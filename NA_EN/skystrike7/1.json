I always saw him as the &#039;king of crit&#039; and an unkillable monster at lvl 6. \r\n\r\nBut nowadays...That isn&#039;t at all unique to Tryndamere. Yasuo, Jhin, and even the reworked Caitlyn are all better known for their huge crits than Tryndamere. \r\n\r\nReworked Taric, Kayle, and Kindred all can allow ANY carry to become unkillable like Tryndamere can. Immunity to death just isn&#039;t all that rare anymore.\r\n\r\nSo what does Tryndamere have? What does he do better than anyone else? I believe he has a identity crisis, and needs a rework to strengthen his strengths, and highlight his weaknesses other than &quot;just cc him&quot;. I could provide some suggestions as to what I believe needs to be done, but I will save those for later, no need to stir up controversy in the 1st post :)","replies":[{"poster":"Hayaishi2","date":"2016-08-19T17:41:00.701+0000","up_votes":59,"down_votes":0,"body":"No identity?

STOPS. SPLITTING.\nWhat he needs removed:\n**His passive-** Tryndamere's passive is just a ball of stats, really lacks any interesting gameplay, and leads to player feeling cheated when he deals 3 crits in a row.  This could be replaced with a three hit passive or maybe even something that reinforces that reinforces that \"Enraged warrior\" theme that's seen in his lore.\n**His W-**  A slow is nice for Tryndamere,  but I hate it's only when you're facing away from you, because it makes him that much more sticky and he gets a ranged AD debuff that you have no way to interact with.  This alone could be replaced with an initiation ability.\n**His ult-** This needs to go the most out of anything.  Remember Poppy's old ult and how broken it was?  It was unhealthy for the game and was a big reason for Riot keeping her in an underpowered state until her rework.  Tryndamere's ult does a similar thing by making him invulnerable for FIVE seconds.  Most hard CC does not last longer than two seconds.
