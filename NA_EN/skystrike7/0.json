How was it supposed to be obtained, and since I was a player during that time, would it be possible to still get it somwhow? I'm looking for a response from Riot but if anybody else knows about this, information would be appreciated!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-23T21:54:53.620+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Season 3 icons, badgers, or borders were awarded to players who were placed in ranked matches.  While it's not something that can be obtained now, every season has traditionally shared rewards like this.  We haven't made any announcements for this season specifically, but your best bet is to get placed in ranked if you haven't already.  Good luck!","replies":[{"poster":"Skystrike7","date":"2016-08-23T22:15:55.015+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh ok, thanks. I only hit level 30 during season 4 so.","replies":[]}]}]}
