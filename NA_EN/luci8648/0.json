Recently at around 4:58 PM today  I was in the loadout for a blind pick match and there ended up being an error in the game that caused a forced exit for me on League. When I returned there I found that I was put in a low proximity queue for 20 minutes. \r\nI am not okay with this. I shouldn't be in a low proximity queue because the game exited on its own. I think its really unfair and there should be a rule that if League experiences a problem and has you exit the game, that shouldn't go towards your buildup to a low proximity queue. \r\nI am really upset because I barely get the time to play league to begin with (1-2 matches a day, 3 if I'm really lucky). Please if there are any staff or administrators out there, if you can see this, please I beg of you get me out of this Low Proximity queue. I was forced to leave a match which I had no control over whatsoever.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-23T01:15:48.048+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It really sucks your client was having problems which resulted in a crash, but ultimately it's up to the player to be sure their software/hardware is working well enough for the game to function correctly. The client can't tell the difference between a crash, or force closing the game. Either way is the same to the lobby, you're just leaving the game and it doesn't care why. Without these dodge penalties, anyone could exit matches without anything happening, which would mean a lot of frustrated players not ever being able to play the game without it being ruined by leavers.\n\nI'm really curious as to what error you saw so we can try to help you fix that up. It doesn't do much good to let this slide without trying to troubleshoot and solve the problem that caused the crash to begin with. I'd try a quick repair first if you haven't yet, but let me know what errors you saw so I can guide you through a few steps.","replies":[]},{"poster":"C9Honeyb","date":"2018-01-23T08:07:12.332+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"mine did the same but when I was I had to restart my computer and when I came back and logged in I wasn't in game and so I went to play another game and it did it again. and now I have 5 game low priority queue.
