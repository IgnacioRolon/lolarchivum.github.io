PLEASE HELP)","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I recently got a new internet service provider that works like a charm. I've updated this game on my computer, (since I took a huge break from it) and wanted to test the new connection on a custom game. When I did, the loading screen popped up and my desired champion and username didn't show up, which led to BugSplat opening up without a moments notice. I figured since it's been a while, something must've been left out while the game was patching. I've waited out the \"**Repair Tool**\", but the same issue still occurred. This goes on for hours. I've sent tickets, followed any troubleshooting instructions on the support site,  and nearly risked destroying a few important files on my computer, but to no avail. Despite the hardcore and toxic community, I just want to get back into it once more, just for the enjoyment. Hope someone helps.\r\n{{sticker:zombie-nunu-bummed}}","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-11T23:58:36.779+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Those Bugsplats are the games way of letting you know that something critically failed within the game files, but the client wasn't able to figure out exactly what went wrong.
