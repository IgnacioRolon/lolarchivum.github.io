Example: Jarvan EQ through Veigar E would stun him but he would go through it to his intended destination. The change we made stuns him like before but now stops Jarvan upon impact AND cancels his E-Q dash.\n\nSo this specifically isn't a bug, but I wouldn't be surprised if there was a bug with Veigar E somewhere though. Please keep bringing these things up if you feel that they're not working as intended x.^","replies":[{"poster":"FHMarshy","date":"2015-04-23T20:33:49.486+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"*GASP* A RED REPLIEDDDD.\n\nI actually thought it was meant to be taht way cuz i've seen quite a bit of those.....\n\nIf that wasn't meant to be, then Veig's E definitely has a bug in it ;P","replies":[{"poster":"M eye Abe","date":"2015-04-23T20:49:26.205+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"hm I think I mislead you. You are correct that this is intended. Your description wasn't correct though. That behavior existed in the old paradigm as well, so I went ahead and clarified what the current paradigm looks like.\n\nwe're not just reds! x.^","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Chocmerc","date":"2015-04-24T05:59:32.005+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"veigar's cage also stops the knockback from lee sins kick too :(  cost me the penta i swear! ;)","replies":[]}]}
