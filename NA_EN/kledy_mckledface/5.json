Fun fact; Our snares share the same range, travel speed, and (from what I can tell), hit radius even though it feels like Morgana Q is a wall sometimes :0. \n\nJust try to change where you throw it, or predict where the enemy will be / go. Another thing you can do is also build Rylais so you can tag them with a slow from  her W before throwing out your Q. If you're close enough and not confident in landing your Q, you could also just run into the enemy, ult them, and wait for the 2nd part of her ult to stun them so you can land a guaranteed dark binding.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-02-18T01:46:20.113+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Suggesting morgana is not viable.","replies":[]}]}
