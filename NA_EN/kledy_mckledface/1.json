I'd suggest trying a client repair - \n\n* Run League of Legends\n* Click on the '?' button that is located in the top right corner of the window\n* Click Repair\n* Wait. The repair function can take anywhere from 5 minutes to over 30 depending on the number of corrupt files it has to repair\n\nIf you're still experiencing the bugsplat after repairing your client, please lemme know!","replies":[]}]}
