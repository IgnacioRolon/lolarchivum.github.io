(Never go full Tryhard) Yet I also find Boards to be really in disagreement with URF, namely after it comes. And Riot did mention that the meta gets stale in that mode, which is why they are trying to ADD the All Random Element in it's next release.\n\nAs for Nexus siege, I like it, though I can't quite put my finger on why. After playing it a few times, I don't see a ton of adjustments to the meta. (Aside from the absence of a Jungler) I think part of it is the Fantasy, You get a strong \"Siege the castle\" feel playing this mode with the use of the siege weapons.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TyrekGoldenspear","date":"2016-09-05T05:08:21.026+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I enjoy nexus siege.\n\nI enjoy all the game modes.
