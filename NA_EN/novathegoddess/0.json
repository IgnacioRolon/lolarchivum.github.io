As far as I can tell, you did gift someone and it went through successfully. Since it's an account-level issue, we want to look into the account with your friend and see why the content isn't available. Please have your friend contact my colleagues through the Support Site so we can get to the bottom of it: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/requests/new","replies":[]}]}
