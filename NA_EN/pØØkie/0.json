It's very strange to have something like this happen without notifying players before hand, unless it's a secretive thing still in production.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Afic","date":"2018-06-11T21:14:36.458+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not entirely sure, but as far as I know loss forgiven tends to be enabled when there are some larger internet or similar related problems that are affecting many players.  \n\nIt is possible that some ISPs had issues which were causing many players to have severely degraded experiences for example.

Do to your phrasing though, it sounds like loss forgiven has been used before. I don't play much ranked, but I'm still surprised I've never heard about this. Do you know when Loss Forgiveness was implemented? Like in Season 3 for example?","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Afic","date":"2018-06-13T21:33:14.947+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't remember specifically when, but it was a while ago (maybe ~3+ years?)","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"TheKidCrusher","date":"2018-06-07T04:31:45.768+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I have the samething and i was suppose to go in my PROM i win like 10 game streak with minimum 20 lp each game SO WHAT the FUCK is that .... i want my another 9lp Look my match history and u will see !!!!!!!!","replies":[]}]}
